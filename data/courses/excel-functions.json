No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:34.577\n&gt;&gt; You said the horrible word.\n\n42\n00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:35.641\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n43\n00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Out comes the flop sweat.\n\n44\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because, of course,\nwhen we're talking about Excel functions,\n\n45\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.200\nfunctions are really formulas, and\nwe're doing formulas, we're calculating.\n\n46\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.603\n&gt;&gt; Are you gonna put\nthe fun back in functions?\n\n47\n00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:51.780\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna try.\n\n48\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.394\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n49\n00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.737\nI have a PowerPoint presentation that\nwe're gonna start to kinda help us along.\n\n50\n00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:59.758\nSo I didn't do any major themes and\nstuff like this, just-\n\n51\n00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:00.632\n&gt;&gt; Keep it simple, right?\n\n52\n00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n53\n00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:01.914\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Wait, this is black on white.\n\n55\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.150\nYes, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Black and white.\n\n56\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.610\n&gt;&gt; So we have Calculation Basics,\nall right, ready?\n\n57\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.680\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n58\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.945\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember this?\n\n59\n00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:11.735\n&gt;&gt; Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.\n\n60\n00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.358\n&gt;&gt; You know it that way too.\n\n61\n00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:14.027\n&gt;&gt; I do.\nYes, that's how I learned it.\n\n62\n00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:14.907\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:15.518\n&gt;&gt; Must be a Florida thing.\n\n64\n00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:16.420\n&gt;&gt; It totally is.\n\n65\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I've had people in class,\n\n66\n00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.505\nI've been teaching Excel for a long time.\n\n67\n00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We always start with this\n\n68\n00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:24.487\nparticular one.\n\n69\n00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:27.061\nI write it on the board,\nand people are like.\n\n70\n00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.950\n&gt;&gt; I have a dear Aunt Sally, and\nyou have to excuse her a lot.\n\n71\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nthen every once in awhile somebody,\n\n72\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.969\nusually around my age,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.810\n&gt;&gt; And they would say that's\nPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\n\n74\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720\nAnd the other people would go, what?\n\n75\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.510\nAnd then I said this is\norders of operations.\n\n76\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's where they're like-\n\n77\n00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a little pneumonic for\n\n78\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.320\nremembering the order of operations.\n\n79\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n80\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.470\nAnd that's where it's,\nokay Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally, and\n\n81\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.850\nthen it was parentheses, exponents.\n\n82\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.090\n&gt;&gt; Multiplication, division.\n\n83\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.410\n&gt;&gt; Division and subtraction, yes.\n\n84\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.065\nAnd then they're like, yeah, that.\n\n85\n00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:02.774\nSo they never learned the little-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] That.\n\n86\n00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:06.049\n&gt;&gt; -Dear Aunt Sally thing.\n\n87\n00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.500\nAnd that's where I always like,\nwell, where'd you go to school?\n\n88\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.320\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was almost universal,\nman.\n\n89\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.140\n&gt;&gt; It was like where did you go to school?\n\n90\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.280\nWhen did you go to school?\n\n91\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.350\nSo I think it was more.\n\n92\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Something that came out\nwhen we were in school?\n\n93\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And it's a Florida thing.\n\n94\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.480\nCuz I've had people my same age,\nthat didn't go to school in Florida,\n\n95\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.400\nlike we weren't taught that.\n\n96\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.046\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n97\n00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:25.614\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n98\n00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:29.204\nSo that's where I thought this was my\nexperiment and you got it right away.\n\n99\n00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:30.895\n&gt;&gt; And I knew.\n&gt;&gt; I got real excited.\n\n100\n00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:34.870\n[LAUGH] So but yes,\nthis is the whole order of operations.\n\n101\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.070\nAnd this is where we said okay, this is\nhow you have to perform calculations.\n\n102\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.140\nAnd the whole idea was\nthat multiplication and\n\n103\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.410\ndivision and addition and subtraction,\nthey're on the same level.\n\n104\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.740\nAnd that was like the whole right to left.\n\n105\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.765\nSo, I have some examples,\nso this right here.\n\n106\n00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.864\nWe have.\n\n107\n00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:58.971\nIf we did not do the order\noperations we would say okay,\n\n108\n00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:02.301\n8 minus 3 is 5, times 2 is 10,\n\n109\n00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:06.610\nminus 4 is 6 divided by-\n&gt;&gt; Divided by 2 is 3-\n\n110\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm not good at math in my head.\n\n111\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Neither am I don't feel bad\n&gt;&gt; But that's not right.\n\n112\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.165\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Because then I have a slide here of\n\n113\n00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:18.764\nthis is where if we did it the wrong way,\nthat's why I have the little numbers, 5,\n\n114\n00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:19.716\n10, 6, 3.\n\n115\n00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:20.680\n&gt;&gt; I assume they're behind your head.\n\n116\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n117\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.060\nthe answer's 5 right\nthere off to the right.\n\n118\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.040\nI made these slides to where it's\ncentered for me not centered for them.\n\n119\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.802\nCuz it's just like my brain wrong side.\n\n120\n00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:33.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't put it over to the left even\n\n121\n00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.192\nthough my box is gonna be, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You will learn.\n\n122\n00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:35.753\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n123\n00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:40.423\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the correct answer is 2 because\n\n124\n00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.190\nthe whole Please Excuse-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n125\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.150\n&gt;&gt; -My Dear, and that's just where when we\nhad our formulas in math class you'd have\n\n126\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.658\nto put the PE, do that whole thing and\nthen you put like a little check box,\n\n127\n00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:52.330\nokay there's no parenthesis.\n\n128\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.260\nOkay, so Please Excuse,\nthere's no exponents.\n\n129\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.700\nThere's, okay division and multiplication.\n\n130\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.542\nIn this sense you would underline it,\nright?\n\n131\n00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.732\nOkay 3 times 2 and then 4 divided by 2.\n\n132\n00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:06.984\nWe would have to perform those, and\nit really didn't matter which one we did\n\n133\n00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:10.158\nfirst because, but-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz both of ' are kind of broken apart.\n\n134\n00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:10.691\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.845\n&gt;&gt; Remember the whole show your\n\n136\n00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:12.790\nwork.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n137\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n138\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.830\nYeah, all those steps.\n\n139\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.479\nAnd so then we'd say now that we're on\nthe addition and subtraction now okay,\n\n140\n00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.460\n8 minus 6 minus 2 plus 2 is 2.\n\n141\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.020\n&gt;&gt; It's funny Justin at\nDeath Row is a math major and\n\n142\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.530\nhe was talking to me about this last week,\nI think.\n\n143\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.145\nAnd he said, in math when you do\nmath as like your job the answer is\n\n144\n00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:37.350\nnot what's important it's the formula and\nhow do you prove it?\n\n145\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.517\nAnd that's why they put such\nemphasis on show your work.\n\n146\n00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:40.264\n&gt;&gt; Show your work.\n\n147\n00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:43.840\nYes and that was the ones like,\ncuz you wanted to combine multiple steps.\n\n148\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.352\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no can't do that.\n&gt;&gt; And they're like no every single line.\n\n149\n00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:47.730\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta prove what you've done.\n\n150\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:51.710\nSo we have a fun one, ready?\n\n152\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna come to our\n\n153\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.160\nfun sky cam view.\n\n154\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Sky cam?\n\n155\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; In an Excel show?\n\n156\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.810\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n157\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.340\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n158\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.035\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like we're a tech show.\n\n159\n00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.142\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna throw up.\n\n160\n00:06:02.142 --> 00:06:07.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I have my trusty little\npen with all the different colors on it.\n\n161\n00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:09.424\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; A friend of mine got this from Ireland,\n\n162\n00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:10.276\nfrom Belfast.\n\n163\n00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:11.468\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n164\n00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:13.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthis is also talking about middle school.\n\n165\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.240\nI figured we'd make a whole\nmiddle school reference.\n\n166\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.339\nCuz these pens, and\nI don't know about anybody else.\n\n167\n00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:18.232\n&gt;&gt; I do, we had them when I was a kid.\n\n168\n00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:19.955\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, I had one that had-\n&gt;&gt; Very popular.\n\n169\n00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.341\n&gt;&gt; -like 16 colors on it.\n\n170\n00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:22.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they had all,\n\n171\n00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:25.175\nthe thing was like this big,\nit was massive.\n\n172\n00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:26.945\n&gt;&gt; Every color under the rainbow.\n\n173\n00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Because we also had back in\nthe day before we had cellphones, so\n\n174\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.568\nwe would write notes to each other.\n\n175\n00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And you always had to write you notes\n\n176\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.277\nin at least 15 different colors.\n\n177\n00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:35.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's how you roll.\n\n178\n00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.698\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So many a girls note, so.\n\n179\n00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we would have to come up here, wow,\n\n180\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.660\nokay, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\n\n181\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.250\nSo we'd put that across the top, right?\n\n182\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And we'd say, all right, so\n\n183\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.160\nwe have to go through and\nparentheses first.\n\n184\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.400\nAll right, so let's do the parentheses,\nwe'll make those blue.\n\n185\n00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo everything in here, all right?\n\n186\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.877\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Is gonna go first.\n\n187\n00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Is gonna go first.\n\n188\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.390\nBut then there's a parentheses\nwithin the parentheses.\n\n189\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.460\n&gt;&gt; It's inside of the parentheses.\n\n190\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.240\nSo, you've got to do\nthe inside parentheses first.\n\n191\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.260\n&gt;&gt; You've got to do that first.\n\n192\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.504\nSo, 5 minus 2 is what?\n\n193\n00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:05.437\n&gt;&gt; It's 3.\n&gt;&gt; 3, and\n\n194\n00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:08.070\nwe're gonna combine some steps,\njust because.\n\n195\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.350\nAll right so, now we have 3.\n\n196\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.380\n&gt;&gt; Positive three.\n\n197\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n198\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.760\n&gt;&gt; And then we have times 3 plus 7.\n\n199\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.690\nI'm going backwards.\n\n200\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.600\nOkay, so now we don't do 7 plus 3.\n\n201\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.044\nWhat do we do?\n&gt;&gt; We do 3 times 3, which is 9.\n\n202\n00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:21.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes and that's 9.\n\n203\n00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:21.848\n7 + 9 is?\n\n204\n00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:22.352\n&gt;&gt; 16.\n\n205\n00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:26.211\n&gt;&gt; 16, all right, so\nwe've got all of that out of the way, so\n\n206\n00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:31.080\nnow we're gonna go ahead and to\nthe second, times 7 divided by 4 times 2.\n\n207\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.400\nAll right, so now and\nthen we do this, remember, right?\n\n208\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n209\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Parenthesis are done,\nso now we do exponents.\n\n210\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.900\nWhat's 2 to 2?\n\n211\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.545\n&gt;&gt; 2 to the 2 is 4.\n&gt;&gt; 4,\n\n212\n00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:43.211\nall right, times 7,\nplus 16 divided by, woops that's 4.\n\n213\n00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:44.344\nThis is why I should write in pencil.\n\n214\n00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:46.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we got exponents.\n\n215\n00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:48.804\nNow we need multiplication and division\nand that's where we have to come in.\n\n216\n00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:55.991\nAll right, so here is 4 times 2, but\nthen there's also 16 divided by 4.\n\n217\n00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.032\n&gt;&gt; But PEMDAS says multiplication first.\n\n218\n00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:01.832\nBut remember, multiplication and\ndivision are on the same level.\n\n219\n00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:02.705\n&gt;&gt; They are on the same level.\n\n220\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:05.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so then it goes left to right.\n\n221\n00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:07.585\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\nyou do 7 x4 first, right?\n\n222\n00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:10.624\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's one here too,\nI forgot that one, yes, okay.\n\n223\n00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:12.793\nSee, this is why my handwriting is so\nhorrible and why it's so\n\n224\n00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:13.975\ngood that we have computers now.\n\n225\n00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:15.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so 7x4 is?\n\n226\n00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:17.842\n&gt;&gt; 28.\n\n227\n00:08:17.842 --> 00:08:18.342\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; No, right?\n\n228\n00:08:18.342 --> 00:08:19.103\nYeah, 28.\n\n229\n00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] we're so\n\n230\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.336\nreliant on calculators though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I told you, I heard math,\n\n231\n00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:29.292\nand I was like, I'm gonna cry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so now I changed my colors\n\n232\n00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:33.811\nin the middle, so now 16/4 is-\n&gt;&gt; Is 4.\n\n233\n00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:34.623\n&gt;&gt; 4 x2\n\n234\n00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:35.753\nis?\n&gt;&gt; 8.\n\n235\n00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:38.683\n&gt;&gt; 8+ 28, the answer is?\n\n236\n00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:41.531\n&gt;&gt; 36, right?\n\n237\n00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:44.228\n&gt;&gt; And remember, you have to circle it.\n\n238\n00:08:44.228 --> 00:08:45.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\n\n239\n00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.928\nyou did very well.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n240\n00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:47.517\n&gt;&gt; This was like being in\n\n241\n00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:48.987\nmiddle school again.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n242\n00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:49.728\n&gt;&gt; I made an F.\n\n243\n00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:50.912\n[LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:52.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I got the pen,\n\n245\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.007\nI got the paper, yes.\n&gt;&gt; You were there.\n\n246\n00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:55.217\nAll you're missing is\n\n247\n00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:56.784\nMadonna bracelets and-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n248\n00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.177\na lot of crying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n249\n00:08:58.177 --> 00:08:59.291\nthat's true.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:02.255\n&gt;&gt; I make it sound like middle school\n\n252\n00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:05.695\nwas the worst thing in the world.\nIt was pretty bad, but I mean,\n\n253\n00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.298\n[LAUGH] it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't that bad.\n\n254\n00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:10.138\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't that bad, I survived.\n\n255\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.529\nSo [LAUGH] you can see that this was our\n\n256\n00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:16.346\nformula that we did on the piece of paper.\n&gt;&gt; Now we know what's wrong with you.\n\n257\n00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.797\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:19.454\n&gt;&gt; You got that right, so [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:21.566\n&gt;&gt; Badoom shh, thank you, thank you.\n\n260\n00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:22.144\n[LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:23.589\n&gt;&gt; So I didn't wanna have to try to do\n\n262\n00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:25.977\nthat on the computer, so\nthat's why this guy can't.\n\n263\n00:09:25.977 --> 00:09:26.838\nIt was fun though, right?\n\n264\n00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:27.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was fun, it was a good time.\n\n265\n00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:28.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not bad.\n\n266\n00:09:28.462 --> 00:09:30.112\n&gt;&gt; So now that we all remember\n\n267\n00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:34.510\nour order of operations,\nhow does that transfer into Excel land?\n\n268\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Because if you're gonna be\ndoing calculations in Excel,\n\n269\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.000\nyou need to follow these rules.\n\n270\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.580\nIf I want to add up all of these and\nthen add up all of these, but\n\n271\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.480\nthen take the result of this and\ndivide it by this, well then,\n\n272\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.310\nyou're gonna have to put parentheses\naround things, aren't you?\n\n273\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.045\nYeah, so do this first, do this first, and\nthen do what's ever in between it, or so\n\n274\n00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:55.993\non and so forth.\n\n275\n00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:59.120\nSo we're using numbers on\nthis particular example.\n\n276\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.950\nAnd actually, let's go back over here to\nmy PowerPoint presentation cuz I just had\n\n277\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.750\nit on the slide now.\n\n278\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.000\nIf we were doing this,\nI mean, this is a formula.\n\n279\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.396\nThis is where I need to make this result.\n\n280\n00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:09.820\nI have to do this,\nthen this, da, da, da, da.\n\n281\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.835\nAll right, well,\nthis is the end of the PEMDAS.\n\n282\n00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:19.574\nCuz now, we're getting into how is\nthis correlated into Excel, and\n\n283\n00:10:19.574 --> 00:10:22.380\nlike I just said,\nit works on the same things.\n\n284\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.510\nSo, what we have here when we\nstart getting into functions and\n\n285\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.520\nformulas in Excel.\n\n286\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.920\nWe do have some vocabulary that's gonna\npop up throughout these episodes here.\n\n287\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.360\nAnd I just wanted to take this\nmoment to just, well, identify it.\n\n288\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.368\nI'm not gonna show you how to do\ncalculations in Excel right now.\n\n289\n00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.057\nI'm just showing you the end results, so\n\n290\n00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.340\nwe can identify,\nthat's what that thing is.\n\n291\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.174\nThat's what that is.\n\n292\n00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:45.161\nThat's what that colon means.\n\n293\n00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.980\n&gt;&gt; It's a true introduction\ninto functions in Excel.\n\n294\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.558\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n295\n00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Start from scratch.\n\n296\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.230\nNobody knows nothing,\n\n297\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.460\neverybody here is a newborn babe\nwhen it comes to Excel functions.\n\n298\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:54.987\nLet's start there.\n\n299\n00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:58.991\n&gt;&gt; And the one thing that we did talk\nabout before this episode was the whole\n\n300\n00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:03.196\nidea of just getting that foundational\nterminology to then not use it right\n\n301\n00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.144\nthe whole time.\n\n302\n00:11:04.144 --> 00:11:05.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n303\n00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:08.230\nnow that I've told you exactly what\nthat is and the correct terminology,\n\n304\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.156\nforget I even said it.\n\n305\n00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:10.147\n[LAUGH] I don't say that.\n\n306\n00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:13.963\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm gonna use another\nword that, to me, that's what it is,\n\n307\n00:11:13.963 --> 00:11:16.265\nbut it's not technically right, yeah.\n\n308\n00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:18.195\nSo that's why we're gonna be technical,\nand then we'll-\n\n309\n00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:19.652\n&gt;&gt; We'll have the editors go back in and\n\n310\n00:11:19.652 --> 00:11:20.503\nbe like, function.\n\n311\n00:11:20.503 --> 00:11:23.130\n[LAUGH] Vonne's mouth is\ndoing something different.\n\n312\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So your formula's functions cell\n\n313\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.670\nreference, now cell reference, we already\nkind of talked about in other episodes.\n\n314\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.396\nIt's like if we say cell A2,\nthat means the column reference and\n\n315\n00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:37.663\nthe row reference,\nthat's the cell reference, okay?\n\n316\n00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:41.119\nBut then there's something known as\nrelative reference, absolute reference,\n\n317\n00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:42.478\nand there's also name ranges.\n\n318\n00:11:42.478 --> 00:11:44.168\nThese are just basic stuff.\n\n319\n00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:46.767\nThere will be other terms\nthat come out through here,\n\n320\n00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:50.883\nbecause this Excel functions series, this\nshow, this is gonna be a pretty big one.\n\n321\n00:11:50.883 --> 00:11:53.077\nCuz there's gonna be lots of\ndifferent topics in here.\n\n322\n00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:56.904\nYou probably already see that over in the\ncourse library, where it's this episode,\n\n323\n00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:58.790\nit shows our different topics.\n\n324\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.667\nAnd we're gonna have a reference\nguide with everything.\n\n325\n00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.919\nThis is gonna be like\nthe never ending series.\n\n326\n00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.257\nWe're just gonna keep\nadding to this forever.\n\n327\n00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:08.288\n&gt;&gt; Two years from now, Excel 2018 just\ncame out, we're gonna scrap all that.\n\n328\n00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the other thing,\n\n329\n00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:15.618\nis like we're not doing this platform\nspecific or version specific.\n\n330\n00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:17.801\nBecause if you think about-\n&gt;&gt; Math doesn't change.\n\n331\n00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.112\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and there's very few changes\nthat happen throughout them with\n\n332\n00:12:22.112 --> 00:12:23.860\nfunctions, specifically.\n\n333\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.290\nAnd just to start clarifying,\n\n334\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.010\na function is just a named calculation,\nokay, it has a name.\n\n335\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.520\nWhich it really is a formula,\nso to me, I'm like, okay,\n\n336\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.480\nwhat's the difference between\na formula and a function?\n\n337\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.629\nWhy don't we jump over here?\n\n338\n00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:41.864\nLet's go ahead and cancel this cuz that\nwas the end of my PowerPoint presentation,\n\n339\n00:12:41.864 --> 00:12:43.149\nand I have my Excel file.\n\n340\n00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:47.115\nAnd this is just my introduction examples,\nand we have our basics, all right.\n\n341\n00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:49.341\nSo I just have some numbers,\nthey don't mean anything right now.\n\n342\n00:12:49.341 --> 00:12:51.665\nThey're just what we've got here.\n\n343\n00:12:51.665 --> 00:12:57.449\nSo if I have, so let me look at my notes,\nE3, okay, so E3, look at the formula bar.\n\n344\n00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:59.155\nNow remember where the formula bar is,\nright?\n\n345\n00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:00.242\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The formula bar is up at the top.\n\n346\n00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:01.910\n&gt;&gt; It's up where the formulas go.\n\n347\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n348\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.941\nSo we need to make sure that in the\nformula bar, every time that you're going\n\n349\n00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:12.278\nto perform calculations in Excel,\nit always starts off with an equal sign.\n\n350\n00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:17.518\nSo, see right up there that the cell,\nthe information says 7, right?\n\n351\n00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:22.473\nThat's what we see, but it's a result of\n\n352\n00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:28.002\nadding up C2, this cell right here, + C3.\n\n353\n00:13:28.002 --> 00:13:30.951\nIt really is 3 + 4 is 7, but we didn't-\n&gt;&gt; Last time I checked.\n\n354\n00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:34.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] but\nwe didn't code it as 3 + 4, this is-\n\n355\n00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, you just did the cells.\n\n356\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.023\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the =, when you put the =\non the front, it's telling Excel,\n\n357\n00:13:41.023 --> 00:13:43.470\ndo this calculation.\n\n358\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.400\nI would say this would be a formula.\n\n359\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.590\nIt is just taking this\ncell plus this cell.\n\n360\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.321\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you haven't given it any\nname, you haven't said this is something\n\n361\n00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.563\nthat I want to always be, and\nI just referenced that named function.\n\n362\n00:13:56.563 --> 00:13:58.410\n&gt;&gt; It's not a named function.\n\n363\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n364\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.164\n&gt;&gt; So that's my clarification.\n\n365\n00:14:01.164 --> 00:14:04.400\n&gt;&gt; So I think of it in program, I do a\nlittle bit of programming, dabble in that.\n\n366\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.390\nAnd sometimes you have a little piece of\ncode that you're like, you know what?\n\n367\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.093\nI can reuse this in a bunch\nof different programs, so\n\n368\n00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.249\nyou create a function, and it has a name.\n\n369\n00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:14.436\nAnd all I have to do\nis call that function,\n\n370\n00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:16.445\nand it does whatever's inside of it.\n\n371\n00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:18.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're doing it here.\n\n372\n00:14:18.994 --> 00:14:19.687\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n373\n00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:20.789\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so yeah,\n\n374\n00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.600\nyou can totally correlate it into\nother things in computers, perfect.\n\n375\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.650\nSo if I come here to this cell,\nnow the answer that I see is 27,\n\n376\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.350\nbut if you look at it, it's saying,\nremember what we talked about,\n\n377\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.820\nthe Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally?\n\n378\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.\n\n379\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.693\n&gt;&gt; Here it is in the flesh.\n\n380\n00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:41.063\nWe're saying add up 3 + 4 + 6 + 5,\nwhich is C2.\n\n381\n00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:44.593\nHere, let me zoom out just a little bit,\nso we can kind of move over.\n\n382\n00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.600\nHere, let me zoom out.\n\n383\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.240\nThere we go, so you can see, C2 + that\none, + that, + that are cell references.\n\n384\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.739\nDo all of that first, and\nthen divide it by B6,\n\n385\n00:14:57.739 --> 00:15:01.599\nwhich is 2, and then times C8.\n\n386\n00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:09.127\nSo 7 + 6 is 11, + 5 is-\n&gt;&gt; You're getting it wrong now.\n\n387\n00:15:09.127 --> 00:15:14.728\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, 3+4 is 7, + 6 is 13,\n\n388\n00:15:14.728 --> 00:15:18.484\n+ 5 is 18, x 2 is 36.\n\n389\n00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:23.511\nNo, divided, 18, 9 x3 is 27 [LAUGH].\n\n390\n00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.411\nWow, you can see-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, buddy.\n\n391\n00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:28.048\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty bad at this in my head,\n[LAUGH] calculator.\n\n392\n00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.531\n&gt;&gt; That's what we made them for.\n\n393\n00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, but I mean,\nthese are just numbers.\n\n394\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.560\nBut you can think about this and like this\nis what I want my information to say.\n\n395\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.678\nSo these are all formulas now,\nbut look at this one.\n\n396\n00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:47.004\nLook, it's E5, cuz I move my, there we go,\nperfect, I just move that mouse over.\n\n397\n00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:48.254\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how it works.\n\n398\n00:15:48.254 --> 00:15:48.871\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n399\n00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:52.071\nthis is saying that this is a function.\n\n400\n00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:55.457\nOkay, it still starts off with the equals,\nso it's performing a calculation.\n\n401\n00:15:55.457 --> 00:15:57.980\nBut SUM, hm, what do you think SUM means?\n\n402\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.914\n&gt;&gt; Last time I checked,\nit's the aggregation of two Numbers,\n\n403\n00:16:00.914 --> 00:16:03.234\nthe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, you just went too far for me.\n\n404\n00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:04.232\n[LAUGH] Aggregation, what?\n\n405\n00:16:04.232 --> 00:16:05.313\n&gt;&gt; I can take two numbers.\n\n406\n00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:06.330\nI got a three, I got a five.\n\n407\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.570\nI put them together I got eight,\nthat's the sum.\n\n408\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Add, yes, there you go.\n\n409\n00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.920\nWe add them together, exactly.\n\n410\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.010\nSo now what we have is\nthat's the function name.\n\n411\n00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.270\nSo SUM is going to go ahead and\nadd up our numbers.\n\n412\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.420\nThen the four that you see\nwhat's in parentheses here.\n\n413\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.440\nYou could see that this is\nopen parentheses C2 colon C5.\n\n414\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.698\nAlright so you're basically saying\nin the parentheses do that function.\n\n415\n00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:35.940\nAdd up C2 through,\n\n416\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.110\nthat's what the colon means-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n417\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.300\n&gt;&gt; The colon means, seat this right there.\n\n418\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nit's some sort of range you give it.\n\n419\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes and so if I actually\ncome into here to start to edit it,\n\n420\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.450\nyou can see there it is, that's my sum,\nthat's what I want you to add.\n\n421\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you really pointed that out,\nbecause a colon in my brain.\n\n422\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.300\nAnd says this and this right?\n\n423\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.930\nAnd not a range a range is\nusually a dash this through this.\n\n424\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.150\n&gt;&gt; That is interesting.\n\n425\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, that is what\n\n426\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.650\nit means in this syntax.\n\n427\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It is funny you say that because it is\n\n428\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.810\nalmost like, I know I did not give\nyou any notes for this episode.\n\n429\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.825\n&gt;&gt; Zero notes.\n\n430\n00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:09.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For this show.\n\n431\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Because well look at this one,\nthis one is the result of eight that is\n\n432\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.040\nadding up C2 and C5, the comma.\n\n433\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the comma makes sense,\n\n434\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.230\nI totally get that, cuz Excel loves\nthose comma separated values.\n\n435\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I get that,\n\n436\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.600\nI've been there enough to go, okay, okay.\n\n437\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.480\nBut if I see a dash come up, and\nit's not a range, I'm gonna freak out.\n\n438\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n[LAUGH] Well, now you know it's a colon.\n\n439\n00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:40.068\nSo there you go, so this is saying C2,\nwhich is three plus C5 which is five,\n\n440\n00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:41.360\nthree plus C5 is eight.\n\n441\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so there's our result.\n\n442\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:49.220\nSo you could see, formula,\njust cells doing some type of calculation,\n\n443\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.120\nusing the cell reference.\n\n444\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A function with a named function, and\n\n445\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.900\nthe parameters that go\ninto the parenthesis\n\n446\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.980\nWhatever is in those parenthesis, do that.\n\n447\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd then colon versus like a comma\n\n448\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.650\nthat you might see from time to time.\n\n449\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.190\nSo those are some basic\nidentification of what you might see\n\n450\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.930\nwhen you're looking at formulas\nwithin the formula bar.\n\n451\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.910\nLet's come over here.\n\n452\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.240\nNow, what I have here is the result is 18.\n\n453\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.402\nOkay, 18 of, well, what does that mean?\n\n454\n00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:20.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at the function,\n\n455\n00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:21.927\nout the formula bar.\n\n456\n00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:24.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Equal sum, functioning,\n\n457\n00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:26.100\nbasics exclamation point.\n\n458\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.050\nWhenever you see that,\nthat means the sheet name.\n\n459\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.220\nLook at the name of\nthe worksheet down here.\n\n460\n00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.250\nBasics okay.\nSo it's saying on that worksheet\n\n461\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.170\ntake the cell range of C2 to C5.\n\n462\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.490\nIt's just these cells again so right here.\n\n463\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.980\nHere are my cells and\nthat's what i'm naming so looking\n\n464\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.870\nthat different syntax exclamation always\ngoing to be referring to sheet names.\n\n465\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.280\nWhen we get into where you can actually\nperform calculations across multiple work\n\n466\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.980\nbooks, multiple files.\n\n467\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then your file name is in,\n\n468\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.740\nI wanna say they're in brackets.\n\n469\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.250\nAngle brackets.\n\n470\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.890\nI don't remember.\n\n471\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.650\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those.\n\n472\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.060\n&gt;&gt; But they're some types of syntax.\n\n473\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.071\n&gt;&gt; We'll know by the time we get there.\n\n474\n00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:03.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you get\n\n475\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.970\ninto where it's gonna use\nthe name of the file.\n\n476\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.240\nIt's in brackets, okay or\nsomething along that.\n\n477\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.440\n&gt;&gt; This is so\nsimilar to a basic programming language.\n\n478\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.260\nIt's so funny.\n\n479\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.420\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So if you have any programming\n\n480\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.580\nexperience you're gonna\nbe going man this is,\n\n481\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.890\nI get it now,\nlet's totally put it together.\n\n482\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.100\n&gt;&gt; We're telling it to do something.\n\n483\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.670\nWe're making it do commands.\n\n484\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.476\nSo that's where it all comes,\nIt all comes from one source, right?\n\n485\n00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:28.450\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Full circle [INAUDIBLE]\n\n486\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Full circular.\n\n487\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n488\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.719\n&gt;&gt; It goes up and\ndown like a carousel [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:33.685\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH], wow okay, no secret.\n\n490\n00:19:33.685 --> 00:19:38.740\n[LAUGH] We're gonna have some name ranges,\nthis is one you would also\n\n491\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.780\nsee in the [INAUDIBLE] cuz we have a whole\n&gt;&gt; Episode on this,\n\n492\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.210\nto where look at the result.\n\n493\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:50.140\nWe have sum, we know what that is,\nnumber underscore name, what?\n\n494\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.010\nYeah, that's just,\nif I double-click it, it's just that.\n\n495\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:20:00.130\nBecause what you can do is intstead\nof giving cell references.\n\n496\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.691\nYou can actually give a cell range a name.\n\n497\n00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so if you think about this and\n\n499\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.700\nlook, if I select this,\nthere it is number, underscore, name.\n\n500\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.700\nI believe we did this\nin the excel advancer,\n\n501\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.980\nthere someone else in some of these\nexcel shows, we've done this before, but\n\n502\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.040\nyou can give it a name and\nif that means something to you.\n\n503\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.050\n&gt;&gt; You could say some of January\nsales plus February sales,\n\n504\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:32.130\nit's not just like C2 through C5 doesn't\nmean as much to me as January sales.\n\n505\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.090\nSo I'm just giving it like a alias,\nlike a name that I want to use.\n\n506\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.038\n&gt;&gt; Well we would call a variable.\n\n507\n00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:40.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, wow you're totally pulling.\n\n508\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.070\n&gt;&gt; I told you.\n\n509\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.370\n&gt;&gt; And I do enough to not know anything,\nto where I'm like I know this too.\n\n510\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.140\nVery cool.\n\n511\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.110\nSo named ranges.\n\n512\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.270\nAnd then some other concepts that we\nhave over here, relative reference and\n\n513\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.330\nabsolute reference.\n\n514\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.330\nThis is when you get into some fun stuff.\n\n515\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.910\nRemember, we're just demonstrating.\n\n516\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.460\n&gt;&gt; We have here some sales, right?\n\n517\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.330\nAnd we have Fuego and\nBishop and everybody here.\n\n518\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.760\nAnd you can see this is Sales.\n\n519\n00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.280\nThis one we've already done, right?\n\n520\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.240\nSo take our range of doing this\nfunction on B2 through D2,\n\n521\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.650\nso January, February and March, perfect.\n\n522\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.320\nWell, when I do it once, do you think I\nwent through and did every single one of\n\n523\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.390\nthese, and if I had fifty rows I'm\nnot doing each one individually.\n\n524\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:24.360\n&gt;&gt; That would be a lot of work.\n\n525\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.190\n&gt;&gt; That would.\n&gt;&gt; And you're real work adverse!\n\n526\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.210\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n527\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah here's the thing\nI'm not down with that.\n\n528\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n529\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.640\nRemember the fill handle?\n\n530\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes filling in series?\n\n531\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n532\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.060\n&gt;&gt; Well the whole idea about\ndoing this when you do it.\n\n533\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Functions or formulas.\n\n534\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.260\nIf I take this and drag it down.\n\n535\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.310\nOne, two, three, it's already done.\n\n536\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.210\nBut what I'm essentially doing is I'm\nsaying take this first one, copy it down,\n\n537\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.300\nbut I'm not copying B2 through D2,\n\n538\n00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:57.310\nit will relatively change its\nreference based on the position.\n\n539\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.190\nSo if I move down one row,\nthe reference has change down.\n\n540\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.930\nYou got it, right?\n\n541\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.620\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n542\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.010\n&gt;&gt; And then you go down to from where\nyou started, that goes down two.\n\n543\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.390\nYou go down three, it goes down three.\n\n544\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.330\nSo as you're filling down,\nit's gonna copy and use\n\n545\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.880\nthe relative reference so then change the-\n&gt;&gt; I'm vaguely remembering this from\n\n546\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.800\none of our previous Excel shows in another\nseries where we have to work with that cuz\n\n547\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.530\nit was like doing something like,\nit's because it's a relative reference or\n\n548\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.310\nan absolute-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n549\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.330\n&gt;&gt; That.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that.\n\n550\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.260\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yes.\n\n551\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.150\n&gt;&gt; It's bringing it back, right?\n\n552\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, relative meaning we're relative,\n\n553\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.720\nit's moving relative\nto where I'm going and\n\n554\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.910\nit doesn't just\n&gt;&gt; You can go across here,\n\n555\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.870\nbecause the file going to go ahead and\nperform clarifications here, do want drag\n\n556\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.010\nit over the reference would change,\nit doesn't matter which way you go.\n\n557\n00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:53.680\nBut absolute reference they got wider\nversus absolute, absolute doesn't move.\n\n558\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.650\nOkay, so\nif I was doing a commission right?\n\n559\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.600\nThis is my commission rate of 10%.\n\n560\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:05.620\nWell, to find the commission of my sales\nthat would mean take this times this.\n\n561\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.740\nAnd that's what I get.\n\n562\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.830\nSo right over here I've got this.\n\n563\n00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.960\nWell, now notice here.\n\n564\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.060\nI'm already gonna just point it out.\n\n565\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.890\nLook at that, you see there?\n\n566\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.750\n&gt;&gt; That is an absolute reference.\n\n567\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.970\nI am telling it, don't,\nwhen I the whole copy down thing,\n\n568\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.080\nI don't want this reference\nto change when I copy it.\n\n569\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.470\nThis one's relative,\ncuz there's no dollar sign.\n\n570\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.790\nYou put a dollar sign in front of the row\nreference, a dollar sign in front of\n\n571\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.315\nthe column reference, or\nwell flip those column then row.\n\n572\n00:23:35.315 --> 00:23:38.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you're saying don't ever\n\n573\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.670\nmove from this position.\n\n574\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.940\nSo when this gets copied down,\nlet me escape that.\n\n575\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:48.880\nSo here's the first one I copied it\nto here, F3 relative, G8 absolute.\n\n576\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:56.680\nMove down one more, F4 relative,\nG8 Absolutes, so don't move from here.\n\n577\n00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.810\nNow, you can have absolute references on\njust the row or just the column, or both.\n\n578\n00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.280\nSo if you think about go ahead and\n\n579\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.190\nrelatively move the row reference but\nnot the column.\n\n580\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.978\nWe'll show examples, but\nyou can have it to where.\n\n581\n00:24:11.978 --> 00:24:16.010\nIt's locking down one or the other.\n\n582\n00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.590\nAnd then anything else would change\nrelatively to where it goes.\n\n583\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:25.830\nSo, that's what we're going to be doing\na lot of throughout all of these episodes,\n\n584\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.550\nbut again starting at\nthe basics get that foundation\n\n585\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.091\nIt's in our central topic so\nthis is one of those.\n\n586\n00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:35.180\n[LAUGH] And this is where it's funny,\n\n587\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.140\nI just created another series in\nCreativePro with video editing.\n\n588\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.555\nAnd we named this file or\nthis episode, Read Me.\n\n589\n00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:45.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was the title of it.\n\n590\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.670\n&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.\n\n591\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.420\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n592\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.970\n&gt;&gt; You wanna always\nread the read me files.\n\n593\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.250\nSo don't skip over this introduction.\n\n594\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.010\nWell if you're watching it, good.\n\n595\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.305\nGood on you.\n\n596\n00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:57.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tell your friends don't skip over this\n\n597\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.445\nintroduction.\n\n598\n00:24:58.445 --> 00:24:59.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n599\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.050\nit goes right\n&gt;&gt; Right on back to what we said in\n\n600\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.630\nthe beginning.\n\n601\n00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.760\nIf I would have just read\nthe introduction files.\n\n602\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.633\n&gt;&gt; But that takes reading!\n\n603\n00:25:06.633 --> 00:25:07.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n604\n00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:08.962\n&gt;&gt; Who wants to read?\n\n605\n00:25:08.962 --> 00:25:10.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But again,\nthat's why you have us.\n\n606\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.810\nSo that is our introduction\nto Excel functions.\n\n607\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it as very cool,\nand like you said,\n\n608\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.550\nvery important, crucial for us to\nunderstand, have the same vocabulary.\n\n609\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.890\nSo then when we're speaking about\nsomething everyone is on the same page,\n\n610\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.740\nno one is going, what are they talking\nabout, I have no idea what that means.\n\n611\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.790\nDefining those terms and\n\n612\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.500\ndefinitions right out of the gate that is\ngoing to help you and help us help you.\n\n613\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.620\nSo, good on you Von for\nhelping us do that.\n\n614\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.590\nGood on you for watching this\nepisode as we said before but\n\n615\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.870\nit looks like we are at that\npoint in time for us to sign off.\n\n616\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.190\nWe're Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n617\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.060\n&gt;&gt;
