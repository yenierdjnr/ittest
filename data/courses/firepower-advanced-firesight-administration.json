          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:07.207\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.921\nIn this video we're gonna take a look at\nthe Cisco FirePower show coming up on\n\n3\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.593\nITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.346\nNow if you haven't heard of FirePower,\nit's a pretty exciting product,\n\n5\n00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.494\none that we're jazzed about.\n\n6\n00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:20.332\nAnd I know I'm especially excited because\nwe have a special guest in the studio\n\n7\n00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.620\nto help us with this show.\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.165\nWe've got consultant, author, all around\nknowledgeable Cisco guy Mr. Todd Lanlier.\n\n9\n00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:33.070\nHe's celebrating the release of his new\nbook on Cisco Sourcefire/Firepower with\n\n10\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.111\nAdvanced Firesight Management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.308\nIt's quite the mouthful, but\nit is quite a good read.\n\n12\n00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.269\nWe've got Todd Lanlier here in the studio,\nI know I'm excited.\n\n13\n00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.825\nTodd thank you for being with us.\n\n14\n00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.868\n>> Fantastic, great to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:47.888\nWe have the most exciting product that\nCisco's released in years, right.\n\n16\n00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:51.278\nSo Cisco bought SourceFire\na couple years ago.\n\n17\n00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:54.901\nAnd lots of money,\nthey invest lots of money.\n\n18\n00:00:54.901 --> 00:01:01.671\nAnd we're gonna see this product in pretty\nmuch their whole range from routers.\n\n19\n00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:03.528\nWe certainly,\nthey have them on their ASA's now.\n\n20\n00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.664\nAnd that's where I work mostly with them.\n\n21\n00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:06.825\nBut they also have the appliances.\n\n22\n00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.798\nBut we're gonna see this, they're gonna\npretty much push this out on all parts.\n\n23\n00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.746\nBecause this is such\na phenomenal security product.\n\n24\n00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.322\n[COUGH] I wanna say right now\nthat I get excited about it.\n\n25\n00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.500\nI wanna make sure you understand\nI don't work for Cisco.\n\n26\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.260\nI don't speak for Cisco.\n\n27\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.453\nAnd they are not paying me.\n\n28\n00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:21.196\nBoy, I wish they were.\n\n29\n00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But they are not.\n\n30\n00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.580\nSo I get excited about it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.410\nI do a lot of consulting.\n\n32\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.210\nI do a lot of training with it.\n\n33\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.404\nI've got other consulting jobs.\n\n34\n00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.340\nBut on the security front, this is the\nmost exciting product I've seen in years.\n\n35\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.832\nAnd it works phenomenally.\n\n36\n00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.737\nReally what it is, it's snort, right.\n\n37\n00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:39.875\nSo we've got the power of snort\nwith the intuitive gooey on top.\n\n38\n00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.315\nWhy don't we go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n39\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.287\nAnd I'll show you some of the power\nof what we're going to go\n\n40\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.721\nthrough in our series here.\n\n41\n00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.638\nSo nonetheless, here we are looking at\nsomething called FireSIGHT management\n\n42\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:52.215\ncenter, or\nalso referred to as the defense center.\n\n43\n00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.258\nAnd I refer to it a lot\nas on old school guy.\n\n44\n00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:58.761\nBut the fact is, is we're looking at here\nand this isn't really a great screen.\n\n45\n00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.810\nYou don't really wanna\nsee this screen at work.\n\n46\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.240\nBecause this is a lot\nof attacks occurring.\n\n47\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330\nSo this is a demo, and\nbasically it's saying.\n\n48\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.100\nHey, we're attacking this constantly.\n\n49\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.330\nThose red lines are my attacks,\nlose my data.\n\n50\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330\nIt more looked like, let me show you\na real network that I'm working on here.\n\n51\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.772\nIt more looked like something like this.\n\n52\n00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:20.088\nAttacks, we don't have very many and\nare ideas are something like this.\n\n53\n00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:22.439\nIn this case here because\nwe're doing a demo.\n\n54\n00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.531\nWe want to see a lot of attacks.\n\n55\n00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.180\nSo we can play with it and\nsee what's going on.\n\n56\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.990\nIn this case here,\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n57\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.900\nAnd I say, look I'm seeing malware.\n\n58\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.669\nAnd do you think malware\nis important today, Don?\n\n59\n00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.548\n>> I don't think so, Tom,\nI mean I'm on a Mac, right.\n\n60\n00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:36.593\nSo I don't have malware problems, do I?\n\n61\n00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.520\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\n62\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.075\nBut I did see you put in\nyour credit card earlier.\n\n63\n00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.353\nSo you can get your files back.\n\n64\n00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:46.312\n>> Absolutely, it said I was encrypted,\nI didn't want that, right?\n\n65\n00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:47.636\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n66\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:50.790\ndon't you think you\nshould've called the FBI?\n\n67\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.473\n>> Our taxpayer dollars do go to them\nto help us out of situations like that.\n\n68\n00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.585\nAre you hinting at the fact\nthat they don't do that?\n\n69\n00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:59.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I don't know.\n\n70\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.313\nI saw something on the news the other day,\nand I was like.\n\n71\n00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:05.730\nWell, I find this fascinating.\n\n72\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.800\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat the FBI thinks about malware.\n\n73\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.420\nAnd what comes in malware?\n\n74\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.621\nSomething called ransomware.\n\n75\n00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.455\nThis is just a piece of it, isn't it?\n\n76\n00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.972\nAnd in this ransomware,\nwhat is the FBI saying here?\n\n77\n00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:19.549\nThe FBI says,\nwell if you read through the article.\n\n78\n00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.477\nThey say,\nwell if everyone just pays the ransom.\n\n79\n00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:24.710\nThe prices are coming down because so\nmany people are paying it.\n\n80\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.400\nAnd it's easier than trying to pay,\nit's less expensive than sending it out to\n\n81\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600\na repair shop to try to\nget your files back.\n\n82\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.080\nSo he just paid his $89.95 and\nhe got his files unlocked.\n\n83\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.049\nWe're sitting here, so\nis malware important?\n\n84\n00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.699\nSure it is.\n\n85\n00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.207\nBecause if this happened\nto you in your corporation.\n\n86\n00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.055\nThey could be charging hundreds\nof thousands of dollars.\n\n87\n00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.290\n>> And just think about,\n\n88\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.010\nit was just a few months ago that\nSony Pictures got involved in this.\n\n89\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.750\nWhere all of their\nmachines got locked down.\n\n90\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.556\nThe whole company, the motion picture side\nof it was basically out of business for\n\n91\n00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.836\nweeks before they managed\nto recover from that.\n\n92\n00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.414\nImagine that happening to your company,\nand\n\n93\n00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.458\nthe amount of money you would\nlose by having that offline.\n\n94\n00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.368\n>> Yeah.\n>> Wouldn't it be nice if we could stop\n\n95\n00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.685\nthat before it even happened?\n\n96\n00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:08.653\n>> And that's just a feature of this,\nand it's the best product for\n\n97\n00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.379\nmalware in the world.\n\n98\n00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.049\nSo viruses and\ntrojans certainly might be a problem.\n\n99\n00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.370\nBut they're nothing compared\nto what malware can give us.\n\n100\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.490\nAnd malware comes in very small packages.\n\n101\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.080\nAnd, so, I mean, they can be on apps.\n\n102\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.820\nThey're very, very small.\n\n103\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.403\nI've seen some really small ones\nthat I was looking at the other day.\n\n104\n00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.979\nBut nonetheless, so we can come here and\nwe can see malware.\n\n105\n00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.335\nLet me go right to a screen\nthat shows some malware.\n\n106\n00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.124\nWhere did I put it?\nRight here.\n\n107\n00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:33.447\nAnd this is showing on this demo.\n\n108\n00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.466\n[LAUGH] And, again, if your work looks\nlike this you guys got a problem.\n\n109\n00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:41.920\nBut nonetheless, I can come in here and\nsay here's my malware.\n\n110\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.670\nAnd again we're determining the file\ndisposition through this product\n\n111\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.580\nby sending something called an AMP cloud,\n\n112\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.230\nAdvanced Malware Protection\ncloud at CISCO.\n\n113\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.152\nAnd they basically gave us a file\ndisposition and they came back and\n\n114\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:52.731\nsaid, hey.\n\n115\n00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:53.939\nThis is bad, right.\n\n116\n00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.120\nAnd they're telling us this file\ncame back with a high fret score.\n\n117\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.153\nSo go ahead and click on this,\nand now when we see this file and\n\n118\n00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:03.319\nwhat this product will give us\nis what's called a trajectory.\n\n119\n00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.431\nIn other words when it got into\nyour network, where did it go?\n\n120\n00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.894\nSo I mean,\nthis is just one of the features.\n\n121\n00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:12.453\nI'm just scratching the surface on what\nwe're gonna cover in our episodes.\n\n122\n00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:16.842\nAnd this is gonna show me where it's gone,\nwho it talked to.\n\n123\n00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:22.670\nAnd the things it gives me is I'm\nnot gonna go through that right now.\n\n124\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.025\nBut I'll do this in the episodes.\n\n125\n00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:27.313\nAnd the fact is,\nwe'll look at the thread score and\n\n126\n00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:31.321\nthe report on it that came from\nwhat's called Talos sandbox.\n\n127\n00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.390\nNonetheless, I can also download the file,\nright.\n\n128\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.423\nSo we can use it in our own sandbox and\nso on, and stuff like that.\n\n129\n00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.813\nBut let's go back here to\ngive more of a big picture.\n\n130\n00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:42.400\nBut the idea was this,\nmalware's a serious issue.\n\n131\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.100\nThis is a very serious product.\n\n132\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.430\nAnd can other companies do a lot of this?\n\n133\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.680\nThe other companies can.\n\n134\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.304\nAnd, again, I'm not gonna pick on other\ncompanies like, you got Palo Alto and\n\n135\n00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.766\nMcAfee and a lot of people use\nthese in their fine products.\n\n136\n00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.807\nThat's not what makes\nthis one sing above them.\n\n137\n00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:03.462\nWhat makes them, this product sing\nabove your other products and\n\n138\n00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.461\nI'll pick on Palo Alto in this case,\npoor Palo Alto.\n\n139\n00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:08.643\nBecause I go out to a lot\nof companies that are like.\n\n140\n00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:10.153\nWhy should I buy this over Palo Alto?\n\n141\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.340\nCuz that's what about we're about to buy.\n\n142\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.134\nAnd I'll show them why, because you've\ngot like at least nine administrative\n\n143\n00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.543\ninterfaces with Palo Alto doing\nthe same thing that we're doing here.\n\n144\n00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:20.913\nAnd it can't do it quite as well.\n\n145\n00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.117\nNot only that, you don't have\nany correlation between events.\n\n146\n00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.253\nSo now we have this single interface.\n\n147\n00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:31.447\nThis phenomenal, intuitive GUI that\ncan help us use our Snort rules to\n\n148\n00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:38.540\nour advantage, stop malware, do URL\nfiltering, and create lots more security.\n\n149\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.220\nAll on one screen,\nwith correlation between events.\n\n150\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.940\nYou got SEM reporting.\n\n151\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.588\nThat's a pretty big deal.\n\n152\n00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:47.359\nSo we've got all this stuff that can\noccur with this one piece of management.\n\n153\n00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.687\nAnd so again,\nif you're looking at other products say.\n\n154\n00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.592\nHey, I wanna see one administrative\ninterface for all of these.\n\n155\n00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.079\nI don't want this siloed approach.\n\n156\n00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:59.365\nWhere I have, appliance, appliance,\nappliance, appliance, VPN con triggers,\n\n157\n00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:00.923\nrouter switches and all this.\n\n158\n00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:02.964\nIn this case we've got our ASA.\n\n159\n00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.053\nYou, you can have an appliance as well.\n\n160\n00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:10.394\nBut the ASA is a phenomenal\nproduct to run this on.\n\n161\n00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:14.088\nWhat it does is it gives us our routing,\nswitching, VPN, and\n\n162\n00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:17.780\nall that other stuff that we\nall know that an ASA does.\n\n163\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.146\nBut now we have the power, or\nwhat we call FirePOWER, right.\n\n164\n00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:24.503\nSo FirePOWER, the term is very\nimportant to understand here, Don.\n\n165\n00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:26.406\nBecause, it's used a couple\nof different ways.\n\n166\n00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:30.798\nThis was created by Sourcefire before\nCisco bought them and FirePOWER came up.\n\n167\n00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:34.714\nAnd it really defines the power\nof the next generation IPS,\n\n168\n00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:36.602\nnext generation firewall.\n\n169\n00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:38.878\n>> And it just sounds cool\nas a marketing term, right?\n\n170\n00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:39.481\n>> It does.\n\n171\n00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:41.896\nAnd so, I don't show it here.\n\n172\n00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:46.411\nBut what the FirePOWER,\nwhere the power is all capitalized.\n\n173\n00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:47.386\nI think you're gonna see that going away.\n\n174\n00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:48.756\nSo now that Cisco's got it.\n\n175\n00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:51.341\nWhen you run an ASA with this product\n\n176\n00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.927\non it the actual term they call\nit is FirePOWER module, right?\n\n177\n00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:56.937\nIs that the case?\nI don't know.\n\n178\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:58.586\nI guess.\n\n179\n00:07:58.586 --> 00:08:01.267\nIt's really hard for\nme to define all these terms.\n\n180\n00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:02.217\nThey seem to change a lot.\n\n181\n00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:03.890\nAs I was writing the book,\nI just kinda gave up.\n\n182\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.474\nAnd says, I'm gonna call the FireSIGHT\nManagement Center, the Defense Center and\n\n183\n00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:08.644\njust kind of stick with it.\n\n184\n00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:11.569\nBut there's also another\nterm called FireSIGHT.\n\n185\n00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.706\nThis is a very powerful technology.\n\n186\n00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:16.906\nSo we see things like FirePOWER,\nFireSIGHT and\n\n187\n00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:22.349\nthey had a technological definition and\nnow they're kind of a lot of marketing.\n\n188\n00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:23.902\nSo, you actually probably saw,\n\n189\n00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:26.738\nit said FirePOWER with FireSIGHT\nadministration, right?\n\n190\n00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:27.736\nWhat does that mean?\n\n191\n00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:32.093\nThe FirePOWER again is our power\nof the next generation IPS.\n\n192\n00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:37.661\nAnd the FireSIGHT is actually a passive\ntechnology that scans our networks and\n\n193\n00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.228\ngathers information about user's hosts and\nin applications.\n\n194\n00:08:42.228 --> 00:08:43.900\nIt's a very powerful tool.\n\n195\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.316\nI love FireSIGHT.\n\n196\n00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.731\nAnd so we will go in that in\ndepth into these series, right?\n\n197\n00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.448\nInto FireSIGHT and\ninto how FirePOWER works and all that.\n\n198\n00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.771\nLet's take a little bit more.\n\n199\n00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.722\nWe won't spend a lot more\ntime in taking your time.\n\n200\n00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:57.112\nBut I want you guys to understand how\ngreat this product actually is, and\n\n201\n00:08:57.112 --> 00:08:58.846\nwhat it can do for your corporation.\n\n202\n00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:00.332\nAnd now there's yet another term.\n\n203\n00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:03.180\nSo we've got, well Sourcefire, right?\n\n204\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.883\nAnd that term is pretty much going away.\n\n205\n00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:06.601\nWe see it still a lot.\n\n206\n00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.923\nBut it's gonna be just Cisco, right?\n\n207\n00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.997\nAnd then we've got FirePOWER.\n\n208\n00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:13.895\nAnd that's the power again,\nas I mentioned of the next generation IPS,\n\n209\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:15.045\nnext generation firewall.\n\n210\n00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.390\nIt runs on our managed devices and\nour defense.\n\n211\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.630\nRemember our managed devices\nare in ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n212\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.603\nThey're already an appliance\nthat's running this.\n\n213\n00:09:23.603 --> 00:09:27.169\nAnd then we get all our vents and\ncorrelation back at the defense center,\n\n214\n00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:28.759\nFireSIGHT management center.\n\n215\n00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.897\nThe newbie I showed you.\n\n216\n00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:31.963\nThere's another term called FireSIGHT.\n\n217\n00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:36.564\nAnd, what this is, is a passive\ntechnology that runs in the background.\n\n218\n00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:39.760\nGathering information on host users and\napplications.\n\n219\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320\nAnd it connects to our eld app.\n\n220\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.260\nAnd so now we can, so basically we can\nput a name and a user to an IP address or\n\n221\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.830\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.990\nVery cool, powerful technology and\n\n223\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.990\nwe'll spend a lot of time on that\nwhen we go through the episodes.\n\n224\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.300\nLet me say there's yet\nanother term, right?\n\n225\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.570\nFireAMP and who knows where\nthese terms are gonna end up.\n\n226\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.760\nBut the fact is FireAMP\nadvanced mail protection.\n\n227\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.440\nThere's two types.\n\n228\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.220\nThere's a network based and a host based.\n\n229\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.760\nAnd we'll talk about that\nduring the episodes as well.\n\n230\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.480\nMalware is a big piece of this.\n\n231\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.040\nRight.\nAnd it is a separate license.\n\n232\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.950\nRight.\nEverything's separate.\n\n233\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.297\nCisco figured out this.\n\n234\n00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:15.791\nHey, we're not gonna just buy this product\nand give you this license forever.\n\n235\n00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.556\nWe want you to pay for\nus every year, right.\n\n236\n00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.720\nOr ever three years.\n\n237\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.420\nSo now let's just go back and take a look\nat the power of the correlating events.\n\n238\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.897\nAnd putting everything together\nin one nice intuitive GUI, right.\n\n239\n00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:28.506\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n240\n00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.805\nThese are our top 15 attacked hosts.\n\n241\n00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.500\nSo we can get right there.\n\n242\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.250\nAnd I can go here and, let's say that i\nsee this host and I know it's a problem.\n\n243\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.610\nI can blacklist it from here.\n\n244\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.690\nI can just right click,\nblacklist, boom, done, right?\n\n245\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.400\nStuff like that adds things to,\nwhat's called security intelligence.\n\n246\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.500\nI have my whitelist, I have my blacklist.\n\n247\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.530\nAnd I basically can add and take things\nout of there and make my network safer.\n\n248\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.170\nSo it'd help me stop a zero-day attack.\n\n249\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.430\nNow, speaking of zero-day attacks.\n\n250\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.050\nThis is called an indication\nof compromise.\n\n251\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.528\nThis was the first known\nproduct a couple years ago.\n\n252\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:02.593\nWhere an attack occurred\nzero day attack occurred.\n\n253\n00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:06.320\nAnd these indication of compromise\ntold me something had changed on host.\n\n254\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.507\nSo we kind of bench marked these hosts and\nunderstand what's going and\n\n255\n00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.030\nFireSIGHT is paying attention.\n\n256\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.330\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsomething changes.\n\n257\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.180\nAnd we're seeing this pop, pop, pop, pop,\npop of these indications of comprise.\n\n258\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.706\nIt kinda looked something like this,\nwhich is pretty scary.\n\n259\n00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:23.447\nAnd the fact is, then we were able to just\ngo over there and blacklist the source and\n\n260\n00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:25.043\nstop that zero day attack.\n\n261\n00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:28.061\nIt was the first recorded stop\nof a zero day attack right away.\n\n262\n00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.153\nAnd I'm sure it's happening more now.\n\n263\n00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.825\nBut it was very kind of cool.\n\n264\n00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:34.721\nAnyways, so nonetheless, we can look at\nmalware and I can drill down in here.\n\n265\n00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:37.136\nNotice I can drill down\nto analysis on here.\n\n266\n00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:40.433\nI can go look at it and\nfind out the host and information.\n\n267\n00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.638\n>> All right, now Tom.\nThat's all some pretty impressive stuff.\n\n268\n00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:44.990\nAnd I know we talked before\nthe show a little bit.\n\n269\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.736\nWhen something's impressive and complex.\n\n270\n00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:49.267\nIt's not normally designed for\nsmall environments.\n\n271\n00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:52.420\nAnd so who's really the target\naudience for the product?\n\n272\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.990\nAnd who's the target audience for\nthis show, right?\n\n273\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.640\nWhat kind of person, and what kind\nof company would be deploying this?\n\n274\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.298\n>> Yeah, and that's a great question.\n\n275\n00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:02.299\nAnd this is what Cisco was able to take,\nthat SourceFire was not able to do.\n\n276\n00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:08.036\nAnd put this on even down to their SoHo\nproducts like the smallest ASA of 55O6X.\n\n277\n00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:13.125\nThat's the lowest model you can get,\nwhich is a really relatively inexpensive.\n\n278\n00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:17.213\nBut again, that would be real Soho,\nsmall office, home office,\n\n279\n00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:19.554\nmaybe a dozen users with this on here.\n\n280\n00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.877\nYou gotta remember this is going\nto add overhead to your network.\n\n281\n00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:26.855\nBut we can go all the way up through\nthe 5585 and get some serious power.\n\n282\n00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:28.713\nAnd if you need more throughput,\nand more power.\n\n283\n00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:34.070\nNow we can go from Soho all the way to the\nmost advanced data centers in the world.\n\n284\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.710\n>> Excellent.\n\n285\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.670\nSo, if you find yourself\nin that environment,\n\n286\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.650\nyou're working for a company,\nsmall, medium, large business.\n\n287\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.120\nSmall business you could\npull it off with the 5506's.\n\n288\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.140\nThat's really branch office kind\nof side where we'd see that.\n\n289\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.153\n>> Yeah, maybe at 5512 or 5515 or 25 or\n\n290\n00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:51.955\nsomething like that,\nagain I was just Make it an analogy.\n\n291\n00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:53.929\nThat, hey you can go all the way down.\n\n292\n00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:57.610\nAnd it is gonna be running on routers,\nor our routers we mentioned.\n\n293\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.880\n>> And it goes all the way up too.\n\n294\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440\nThey've got the dedicated appliance.\n\n295\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.220\nI can't remember the model number for it.\n\n296\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.030\n>> Those are the 3D models.\n\n297\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.522\nYeah, so just add an extra\ncouple of zeros to your PO.\n\n298\n00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:09.659\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can have that too.\n\n299\n00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.254\n>> So\nit can handle very powerful networks and\n\n300\n00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.965\ngive you a level of security you\ncouldn't necessarily achieve before.\n\n301\n00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:16.891\nNow if that sounds exciting to you,\nit should.\n\n302\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:17.633\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n303\n00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:18.790\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n304\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.250\n>> And you're in the right place.\n\n305\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.776\nSo stay tuned.\nWe've got FirePOWER\n\n306\n00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:25.117\nepisodes coming up where we get a chance\nto see all of this in action and\n\n307\n00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:27.024\nhow you can use it in your environment.\n\n308\n00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:28.232\nIf it doesn't sound right for you.\n\n309\n00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:30.810\nNo big deal there, we've got plenty of\nother content in the course library.\n\n310\n00:13:30.810 -->
