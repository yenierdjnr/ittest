          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:07.207\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.921\nIn this video we're gonna take a look at\nthe Cisco FirePower show coming up on\n\n3\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.593\nITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.346\nNow if you haven't heard of FirePower,\nit's a pretty exciting product,\n\n5\n00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.494\none that we're jazzed about.\n\n6\n00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:20.332\nAnd I know I'm especially excited because\nwe have a special guest in the studio\n\n7\n00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.620\nto help us with this show.\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.165\nWe've got consultant, author, all around\nknowledgeable Cisco guy Mr. Todd Lanlier.\n\n9\n00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:33.070\nHe's celebrating the release of his new\nbook on Cisco Sourcefire/Firepower with\n\n10\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.111\nAdvanced Firesight Management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.308\nIt's quite the mouthful, but\nit is quite a good read.\n\n12\n00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.269\nWe've got Todd Lanlier here in the studio,\nI know I'm excited.\n\n13\n00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.825\nTodd thank you for being with us.\n\n14\n00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.868\n>> Fantastic, great to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:47.888\nWe have the most exciting product that\nCisco's released in years, right.\n\n16\n00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:51.278\nSo Cisco bought SourceFire\na couple years ago.\n\n17\n00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:54.901\nAnd lots of money,\nthey invest lots of money.\n\n18\n00:00:54.901 --> 00:01:01.671\nAnd we're gonna see this product in pretty\nmuch their whole range from routers.\n\n19\n00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:03.528\nWe certainly,\nthey have them on their ASA's now.\n\n20\n00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.664\nAnd that's where I work mostly with them.\n\n21\n00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:06.825\nBut they also have the appliances.\n\n22\n00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.798\nBut we're gonna see this, they're gonna\npretty much push this out on all parts.\n\n23\n00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.746\nBecause this is such\na phenomenal security product.\n\n24\n00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.322\n[COUGH] I wanna say right now\nthat I get excited about it.\n\n25\n00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.500\nI wanna make sure you understand\nI don't work for Cisco.\n\n26\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.260\nI don't speak for Cisco.\n\n27\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.453\nAnd they are not paying me.\n\n28\n00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:21.196\nBoy, I wish they were.\n\n29\n00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But they are not.\n\n30\n00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.580\nSo I get excited about it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.410\nI do a lot of consulting.\n\n32\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.210\nI do a lot of training with it.\n\n33\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.404\nI've got other consulting jobs.\n\n34\n00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.340\nBut on the security front, this is the\nmost exciting product I've seen in years.\n\n35\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.832\nAnd it works phenomenally.\n\n36\n00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.737\nReally what it is, it's snort, right.\n\n37\n00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:39.875\nSo we've got the power of snort\nwith the intuitive gooey on top.\n\n38\n00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.315\nWhy don't we go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n39\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.287\nAnd I'll show you some of the power\nof what we're going to go\n\n40\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.721\nthrough in our series here.\n\n41\n00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.638\nSo nonetheless, here we are looking at\nsomething called FireSIGHT management\n\n42\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:52.215\ncenter, or\nalso referred to as the defense center.\n\n43\n00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.258\nAnd I refer to it a lot\nas on old school guy.\n\n44\n00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:58.761\nBut the fact is, is we're looking at here\nand this isn't really a great screen.\n\n45\n00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.810\nYou don't really wanna\nsee this screen at work.\n\n46\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.240\nBecause this is a lot\nof attacks occurring.\n\n47\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330\nSo this is a demo, and\nbasically it's saying.\n\n48\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.100\nHey, we're attacking this constantly.\n\n49\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.330\nThose red lines are my attacks,\nlose my data.\n\n50\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330\nIt more looked like, let me show you\na real network that I'm working on here.\n\n51\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.772\nIt more looked like something like this.\n\n52\n00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:20.088\nAttacks, we don't have very many and\nare ideas are something like this.\n\n53\n00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:22.439\nIn this case here because\nwe're doing a demo.\n\n54\n00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.531\nWe want to see a lot of attacks.\n\n55\n00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.180\nSo we can play with it and\nsee what's going on.\n\n56\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.990\nIn this case here,\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n57\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.900\nAnd I say, look I'm seeing malware.\n\n58\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.669\nAnd do you think malware\nis important today, Don?\n\n59\n00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.548\n>> I don't think so, Tom,\nI mean I'm on a Mac, right.\n\n60\n00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:36.593\nSo I don't have malware problems, do I?\n\n61\n00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.520\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\n62\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.075\nBut I did see you put in\nyour credit card earlier.\n\n63\n00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.353\nSo you can get your files back.\n\n64\n00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:46.312\n>> Absolutely, it said I was encrypted,\nI didn't want that, right?\n\n65\n00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:47.636\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n66\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:50.790\ndon't you think you\nshould've called the FBI?\n\n67\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.473\n>> Our taxpayer dollars do go to them\nto help us out of situations like that.\n\n68\n00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.585\nAre you hinting at the fact\nthat they don't do that?\n\n69\n00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:59.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I don't know.\n\n70\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.313\nI saw something on the news the other day,\nand I was like.\n\n71\n00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:05.730\nWell, I find this fascinating.\n\n72\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.800\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat the FBI thinks about malware.\n\n73\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.420\nAnd what comes in malware?\n\n74\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.621\nSomething called ransomware.\n\n75\n00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.455\nThis is just a piece of it, isn't it?\n\n76\n00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.972\nAnd in this ransomware,\nwhat is the FBI saying here?\n\n77\n00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:19.549\nThe FBI says,\nwell if you read through the article.\n\n78\n00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.477\nThey say,\nwell if everyone just pays the ransom.\n\n79\n00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:24.710\nThe prices are coming down because so\nmany people are paying it.\n\n80\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.400\nAnd it's easier than trying to pay,\nit's less expensive than sending it out to\n\n81\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600\na repair shop to try to\nget your files back.\n\n82\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.080\nSo he just paid his $89.95 and\nhe got his files unlocked.\n\n83\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.049\nWe're sitting here, so\nis malware important?\n\n84\n00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.699\nSure it is.\n\n85\n00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.207\nBecause if this happened\nto you in your corporation.\n\n86\n00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.055\nThey could be charging hundreds\nof thousands of dollars.\n\n87\n00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.290\n>> And just think about,\n\n88\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.010\nit was just a few months ago that\nSony Pictures got involved in this.\n\n89\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.750\nWhere all of their\nmachines got locked down.\n\n90\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.556\nThe whole company, the motion picture side\nof it was basically out of business for\n\n91\n00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.836\nweeks before they managed\nto recover from that.\n\n92\n00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.414\nImagine that happening to your company,\nand\n\n93\n00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.458\nthe amount of money you would\nlose by having that offline.\n\n94\n00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.368\n>> Yeah.\n>> Wouldn't it be nice if we could stop\n\n95\n00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.685\nthat before it even happened?\n\n96\n00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:08.653\n>> And that's just a feature of this,\nand it's the best product for\n\n97\n00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.379\nmalware in the world.\n\n98\n00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.049\nSo viruses and\ntrojans certainly might be a problem.\n\n99\n00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.370\nBut they're nothing compared\nto what malware can give us.\n\n100\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.490\nAnd malware comes in very small packages.\n\n101\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.080\nAnd, so, I mean, they can be on apps.\n\n102\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.820\nThey're very, very small.\n\n103\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.403\nI've seen some really small ones\nthat I was looking at the other day.\n\n104\n00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.979\nBut nonetheless, so we can come here and\nwe can see malware.\n\n105\n00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.335\nLet me go right to a screen\nthat shows some malware.\n\n106\n00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.124\nWhere did I put it?\nRight here.\n\n107\n00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:33.447\nAnd this is showing on this demo.\n\n108\n00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.466\n[LAUGH] And, again, if your work looks\nlike this you guys got a problem.\n\n109\n00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:41.920\nBut nonetheless, I can come in here and\nsay here's my malware.\n\n110\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.670\nAnd again we're determining the file\ndisposition through this product\n\n111\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.580\nby sending something called an AMP cloud,\n\n112\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.230\nAdvanced Malware Protection\ncloud at CISCO.\n\n113\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.152\nAnd they basically gave us a file\ndisposition and they came back and\n\n114\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:52.731\nsaid, hey.\n\n115\n00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:53.939\nThis is bad, right.\n\n116\n00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.120\nAnd they're telling us this file\ncame back with a high fret score.\n\n117\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.153\nSo go ahead and click on this,\nand now when we see this file and\n\n118\n00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:03.319\nwhat this product will give us\nis what's called a trajectory.\n\n119\n00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.431\nIn other words when it got into\nyour network, where did it go?\n\n120\n00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.894\nSo I mean,\nthis is just one of the features.\n\n121\n00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:12.453\nI'm just scratching the surface on what\nwe're gonna cover in our episodes.\n\n122\n00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:16.842\nAnd this is gonna show me where it's gone,\nwho it talked to.\n\n123\n00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:22.670\nAnd the things it gives me is I'm\nnot gonna go through that right now.\n\n124\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.025\nBut I'll do this in the episodes.\n\n125\n00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:27.313\nAnd the fact is,\nwe'll look at the thread score and\n\n126\n00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:31.321\nthe report on it that came from\nwhat's called Talos sandbox.\n\n127\n00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.390\nNonetheless, I can also download the file,\nright.\n\n128\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.423\nSo we can use it in our own sandbox and\nso on, and stuff like that.\n\n129\n00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.813\nBut let's go back here to\ngive more of a big picture.\n\n130\n00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:42.400\nBut the idea was this,\nmalware's a serious issue.\n\n131\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.100\nThis is a very serious product.\n\n132\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.430\nAnd can other companies do a lot of this?\n\n133\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.680\nThe other companies can.\n\n134\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.304\nAnd, again, I'm not gonna pick on other\ncompanies like, you got Palo Alto and\n\n135\n00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.766\nMcAfee and a lot of people use\nthese in their fine products.\n\n136\n00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.807\nThat's not what makes\nthis one sing above them.\n\n137\n00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:03.462\nWhat makes them, this product sing\nabove your other products and\n\n138\n00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.461\nI'll pick on Palo Alto in this case,\npoor Palo Alto.\n\n139\n00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:08.643\nBecause I go out to a lot\nof companies that are like.\n\n140\n00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:10.153\nWhy should I buy this over Palo Alto?\n\n141\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.340\nCuz that's what about we're about to buy.\n\n142\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.134\nAnd I'll show them why, because you've\ngot like at least nine administrative\n\n143\n00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.543\ninterfaces with Palo Alto doing\nthe same thing that we're doing here.\n\n144\n00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:20.913\nAnd it can't do it quite as well.\n\n145\n00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.117\nNot only that, you don't have\nany correlation between events.\n\n146\n00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.253\nSo now we have this single interface.\n\n147\n00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:31.447\nThis phenomenal, intuitive GUI that\ncan help us use our Snort rules to\n\n148\n00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:38.540\nour advantage, stop malware, do URL\nfiltering, and create lots more security.\n\n149\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.220\nAll on one screen,\nwith correlation between events.\n\n150\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.940\nYou got SEM reporting.\n\n151\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.588\nThat's a pretty big deal.\n\n152\n00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:47.359\nSo we've got all this stuff that can\noccur with this one piece of management.\n\n153\n00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.687\nAnd so again,\nif you're looking at other products say.\n\n154\n00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.592\nHey, I wanna see one administrative\ninterface for all of these.\n\n155\n00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.079\nI don't want this siloed approach.\n\n156\n00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:59.365\nWhere I have, appliance, appliance,\nappliance, appliance, VPN con triggers,\n\n157\n00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:00.923\nrouter switches and all this.\n\n158\n00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:02.964\nIn this case we've got our ASA.\n\n159\n00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.053\nYou, you can have an appliance as well.\n\n160\n00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:10.394\nBut the ASA is a phenomenal\nproduct to run this on.\n\n161\n00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:14.088\nWhat it does is it gives us our routing,\nswitching, VPN, and\n\n162\n00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:17.780\nall that other stuff that we\nall know that an ASA does.\n\n163\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.146\nBut now we have the power, or\nwhat we call FirePOWER, right.\n\n164\n00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:24.503\nSo FirePOWER, the term is very\nimportant to understand here, Don.\n\n165\n00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:26.406\nBecause, it's used a couple\nof different ways.\n\n166\n00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:30.798\nThis was created by Sourcefire before\nCisco bought them and FirePOWER came up.\n\n167\n00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:34.714\nAnd it really defines the power\nof the next generation IPS,\n\n168\n00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:36.602\nnext generation firewall.\n\n169\n00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:38.878\n>> And it just sounds cool\nas a marketing term, right?\n\n170\n00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:39.481\n>> It does.\n\n171\n00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:41.896\nAnd so, I don't show it here.\n\n172\n00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:46.411\nBut what the FirePOWER,\nwhere the power is all capitalized.\n\n173\n00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:47.386\nI think you're gonna see that going away.\n\n174\n00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:48.756\nSo now that Cisco's got it.\n\n175\n00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:51.341\nWhen you run an ASA with this product\n\n176\n00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.927\non it the actual term they call\nit is FirePOWER module, right?\n\n177\n00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:56.937\nIs that the case?\nI don't know.\n\n178\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:58.586\nI guess.\n\n179\n00:07:58.586 --> 00:08:01.267\nIt's really hard for\nme to define all these terms.\n\n180\n00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:02.217\nThey seem to change a lot.\n\n181\n00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:03.890\nAs I was writing the book,\nI just kinda gave up.\n\n182\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.474\nAnd says, I'm gonna call the FireSIGHT\nManagement Center, the Defense Center and\n\n183\n00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:08.644\njust kind of stick with it.\n\n184\n00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:11.569\nBut there's also another\nterm called FireSIGHT.\n\n185\n00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.706\nThis is a very powerful technology.\n\n186\n00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:16.906\nSo we see things like FirePOWER,\nFireSIGHT and\n\n187\n00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:22.349\nthey had a technological definition and\nnow they're kind of a lot of marketing.\n\n188\n00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:23.902\nSo, you actually probably saw,\n\n189\n00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:26.738\nit said FirePOWER with FireSIGHT\nadministration, right?\n\n190\n00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:27.736\nWhat does that mean?\n\n191\n00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:32.093\nThe FirePOWER again is our power\nof the next generation IPS.\n\n192\n00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:37.661\nAnd the FireSIGHT is actually a passive\ntechnology that scans our networks and\n\n193\n00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.228\ngathers information about user's hosts and\nin applications.\n\n194\n00:08:42.228 --> 00:08:43.900\nIt's a very powerful tool.\n\n195\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.316\nI love FireSIGHT.\n\n196\n00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.731\nAnd so we will go in that in\ndepth into these series, right?\n\n197\n00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.448\nInto FireSIGHT and\ninto how FirePOWER works and all that.\n\n198\n00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.771\nLet's take a little bit more.\n\n199\n00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.722\nWe won't spend a lot more\ntime in taking your time.\n\n200\n00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:57.112\nBut I want you guys to understand how\ngreat this product actually is, and\n\n201\n00:08:57.112 --> 00:08:58.846\nwhat it can do for your corporation.\n\n202\n00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:00.332\nAnd now there's yet another term.\n\n203\n00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:03.180\nSo we've got, well Sourcefire, right?\n\n204\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.883\nAnd that term is pretty much going away.\n\n205\n00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:06.601\nWe see it still a lot.\n\n206\n00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.923\nBut it's gonna be just Cisco, right?\n\n207\n00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.997\nAnd then we've got FirePOWER.\n\n208\n00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:13.895\nAnd that's the power again,\nas I mentioned of the next generation IPS,\n\n209\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:15.045\nnext generation firewall.\n\n210\n00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.390\nIt runs on our managed devices and\nour defense.\n\n211\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.630\nRemember our managed devices\nare in ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n212\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.603\nThey're already an appliance\nthat's running this.\n\n213\n00:09:23.603 --> 00:09:27.169\nAnd then we get all our vents and\ncorrelation back at the defense center,\n\n214\n00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:28.759\nFireSIGHT management center.\n\n215\n00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.897\nThe newbie I showed you.\n\n216\n00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:31.963\nThere's another term called FireSIGHT.\n\n217\n00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:36.564\nAnd, what this is, is a passive\ntechnology that runs in the background.\n\n218\n00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:39.760\nGathering information on host users and\napplications.\n\n219\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320\nAnd it connects to our eld app.\n\n220\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.260\nAnd so now we can, so basically we can\nput a name and a user to an IP address or\n\n221\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.830\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.990\nVery cool, powerful technology and\n\n223\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.990\nwe'll spend a lot of time on that\nwhen we go through the episodes.\n\n224\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.300\nLet me say there's yet\nanother term, right?\n\n225\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.570\nFireAMP and who knows where\nthese terms are gonna end up.\n\n226\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.760\nBut the fact is FireAMP\nadvanced mail protection.\n\n227\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.440\nThere's two types.\n\n228\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.220\nThere's a network based and a host based.\n\n229\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.760\nAnd we'll talk about that\nduring the episodes as well.\n\n230\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.480\nMalware is a big piece of this.\n\n231\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.040\nRight.\nAnd it is a separate license.\n\n232\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.950\nRight.\nEverything's separate.\n\n233\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.297\nCisco figured out this.\n\n234\n00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:15.791\nHey, we're not gonna just buy this product\nand give you this license forever.\n\n235\n00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.556\nWe want you to pay for\nus every year, right.\n\n236\n00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.720\nOr ever three years.\n\n237\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.420\nSo now let's just go back and take a look\nat the power of the correlating events.\n\n238\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.897\nAnd putting everything together\nin one nice intuitive GUI, right.\n\n239\n00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:28.506\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n240\n00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.805\nThese are our top 15 attacked hosts.\n\n241\n00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.500\nSo we can get right there.\n\n242\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.250\nAnd I can go here and, let's say that i\nsee this host and I know it's a problem.\n\n243\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.610\nI can blacklist it from here.\n\n244\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.690\nI can just right click,\nblacklist, boom, done, right?\n\n245\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.400\nStuff like that adds things to,\nwhat's called security intelligence.\n\n246\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.500\nI have my whitelist, I have my blacklist.\n\n247\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.530\nAnd I basically can add and take things\nout of there and make my network safer.\n\n248\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.170\nSo it'd help me stop a zero-day attack.\n\n249\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.430\nNow, speaking of zero-day attacks.\n\n250\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.050\nThis is called an indication\nof compromise.\n\n251\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.528\nThis was the first known\nproduct a couple years ago.\n\n252\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:02.593\nWhere an attack occurred\nzero day attack occurred.\n\n253\n00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:06.320\nAnd these indication of compromise\ntold me something had changed on host.\n\n254\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.507\nSo we kind of bench marked these hosts and\nunderstand what's going and\n\n255\n00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.030\nFireSIGHT is paying attention.\n\n256\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.330\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsomething changes.\n\n257\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.180\nAnd we're seeing this pop, pop, pop, pop,\npop of these indications of comprise.\n\n258\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.706\nIt kinda looked something like this,\nwhich is pretty scary.\n\n259\n00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:23.447\nAnd the fact is, then we were able to just\ngo over there and blacklist the source and\n\n260\n00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:25.043\nstop that zero day attack.\n\n261\n00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:28.061\nIt was the first recorded stop\nof a zero day attack right away.\n\n262\n00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.153\nAnd I'm sure it's happening more now.\n\n263\n00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.825\nBut it was very kind of cool.\n\n264\n00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:34.721\nAnyways, so nonetheless, we can look at\nmalware and I can drill down in here.\n\n265\n00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:37.136\nNotice I can drill down\nto analysis on here.\n\n266\n00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:40.433\nI can go look at it and\nfind out the host and information.\n\n267\n00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.638\n>> All right, now Tom.\nThat's all some pretty impressive stuff.\n\n268\n00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:44.990\nAnd I know we talked before\nthe show a little bit.\n\n269\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.736\nWhen something's impressive and complex.\n\n270\n00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:49.267\nIt's not normally designed for\nsmall environments.\n\n271\n00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:52.420\nAnd so who's really the target\naudience for the product?\n\n272\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.990\nAnd who's the target audience for\nthis show, right?\n\n273\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.640\nWhat kind of person, and what kind\nof company would be deploying this?\n\n274\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.298\n>> Yeah, and that's a great question.\n\n275\n00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:02.299\nAnd this is what Cisco was able to take,\nthat SourceFire was not able to do.\n\n276\n00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:08.036\nAnd put this on even down to their SoHo\nproducts like the smallest ASA of 55O6X.\n\n277\n00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:13.125\nThat's the lowest model you can get,\nwhich is a really relatively inexpensive.\n\n278\n00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:17.213\nBut again, that would be real Soho,\nsmall office, home office,\n\n279\n00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:19.554\nmaybe a dozen users with this on here.\n\n280\n00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.877\nYou gotta remember this is going\nto add overhead to your network.\n\n281\n00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:26.855\nBut we can go all the way up through\nthe 5585 and get some serious power.\n\n282\n00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:28.713\nAnd if you need more throughput,\nand more power.\n\n283\n00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:34.070\nNow we can go from Soho all the way to the\nmost advanced data centers in the world.\n\n284\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.710\n>> Excellent.\n\n285\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.670\nSo, if you find yourself\nin that environment,\n\n286\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.650\nyou're working for a company,\nsmall, medium, large business.\n\n287\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.120\nSmall business you could\npull it off with the 5506's.\n\n288\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.140\nThat's really branch office kind\nof side where we'd see that.\n\n289\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.153\n>> Yeah, maybe at 5512 or 5515 or 25 or\n\n290\n00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:51.955\nsomething like that,\nagain I was just Make it an analogy.\n\n291\n00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:53.929\nThat, hey you can go all the way down.\n\n292\n00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:57.610\nAnd it is gonna be running on routers,\nor our routers we mentioned.\n\n293\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.880\n>> And it goes all the way up too.\n\n294\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440\nThey've got the dedicated appliance.\n\n295\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.220\nI can't remember the model number for it.\n\n296\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.030\n>> Those are the 3D models.\n\n297\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.522\nYeah, so just add an extra\ncouple of zeros to your PO.\n\n298\n00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:09.659\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can have that too.\n\n299\n00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.254\n>> So\nit can handle very powerful networks and\n\n300\n00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.965\ngive you a level of security you\ncouldn't necessarily achieve before.\n\n301\n00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:16.891\nNow if that sounds exciting to you,\nit should.\n\n302\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:17.633\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n303\n00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:18.790\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n304\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.250\n>> And you're in the right place.\n\n305\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.776\nSo stay tuned.\nWe've got FirePOWER\n\n306\n00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:25.117\nepisodes coming up where we get a chance\nto see all of this in action and\n\n307\n00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:27.024\nhow you can use it in your environment.\n\n308\n00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:28.232\nIf it doesn't sound right for you.\n\n309\n00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:30.810\nNo big deal there, we've got plenty of\nother content in the course library.\n\n310\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.434\nBe sure to check that out.\n\n311\n00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:36.081\nBut if you're looking for FirePOWER,\nstay tuned, it's coming up next.\n\n312\n00:13:36.081 -->

00:00:18.380\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.166\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:25.534\nback with another episode of well actually\nfirst episode of Cisco FirePower.\n\n6\n00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:28.733\nIt's a great new technology that\na lot of people are talking about,\n\n7\n00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.725\nI know that we've had a lot of\nviewers asking to learn about it.\n\n8\n00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:33.749\nAnd so we're gonna be diving\ninto that right here and\n\n9\n00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:35.782\nI got somebody special here\nin the studio to help us.\n\n10\n00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:39.307\nSomebody who's very passionate and\nexcited about Sourcefire and FirePOWER and\n\n11\n00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.962\nall the other names I can throw out there,\nMr. Todd Lammle.\n\n12\n00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:45.434\nTodd, thank you for being in the studio\nhere with us, and let's get started.\n\n13\n00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:49.210\n>> Yeah, this is a very\nexciting technology as he said.\n\n14\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.020\nI am really happy to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.830\nThanks for the invite.\n\n16\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.338\nI am very excited about this.\n\n17\n00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:56.420\nI'm gonna get so excited at times,\nyou're gonna be going,\n\n18\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.785\nhow much is Cisco paying you to do this?\n\n19\n00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:01.845\nI want you to rest assured that I am\nnot being paid by CISCO to do this.\n\n20\n00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:02.467\nI wish I was.\nBut\n\n21\n00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.297\nI get very excited about this technology.\n\n22\n00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.990\nAnd I'm very encouraged about it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.514\nAnd I just had my new book came out\njust last week on source FirePOWER,\n\n24\n00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:14.559\nwhich we have on the screen\nhere as FirePOWER.\n\n25\n00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:18.285\nAnd I wanna show you guys what is\nthis product and how does it go.\n\n26\n00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:22.698\nSo if we can look at my screen here,\nwhat is is FirePOWER and what does it do.\n\n27\n00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:26.079\nSo Don, really what I wanna talk about is\nhow does this work in our network today\n\n28\n00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.478\nand why is this so important and why is\nthis the biggest thing that's going on.\n\n29\n00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:33.257\nI am so busy, I'm getting called by\nCisco and large corporations and\n\n30\n00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:35.538\neveryone wants to have this product, and\n\n31\n00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:39.009\nit's the best security product\nin the market by far right now.\n\n32\n00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.654\nSo Cisco bought Sourcefire,\nis the company.\n\n33\n00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:43.154\nRight?\n\n34\n00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:46.098\nSourcefire a couple of years ago now,\nand I started working with Dan and\n\n35\n00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.563\nwas doing consulting and\ntraining for advanced services.\n\n36\n00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:52.178\nAnd the thing was is\nthat this is the newest,\n\n37\n00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.518\ngreatest It's really snort with a GUI.\n\n38\n00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:56.018\nRight?\n\n39\n00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:59.141\nSo snort was always a little cumbersome,\nwe're working with text files.\n\n40\n00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:00.458\nAnd this made it automated.\n\n41\n00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:01.132\nRight?\n\n42\n00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.546\nAnd gave us reports and\ngraphs, and pretty graphs.\n\n43\n00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.942\nRight?\nAnd that's really helpful, so\n\n44\n00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:10.408\nwhat we're looking at here is different,\nwhat they call Manage Devices.\n\n45\n00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:12.470\nRight?\nSo these manage devices,\n\n46\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.349\nwe put them out into our network and\nwe're watching data as it comes through.\n\n47\n00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.399\nAnd we're looking at this and\nthese threats real time, and\n\n48\n00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.154\nwe're adjusting these and\nwe're adapting to them.\n\n49\n00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:26.951\nAnd we can act and\nremediate them and fix them, and\n\n50\n00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.211\nthen we just do it all over\nagain in a continuous motion.\n\n51\n00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:31.757\nRight?\n\n52\n00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:36.527\nSo, the thing is there ae some different\nappliances, and the biggest thing\n\n53\n00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:41.082\nthat I work on most of the time is\nthe ASA product down here, the new ASA X.\n\n54\n00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:43.077\nRight?\nThe 5500 X series,\n\n55\n00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:47.699\ncan take the new software module for\nthe lower end of 5500s, and for\n\n56\n00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.870\nthe 5585 we actually\nhave a hardware blade.\n\n57\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.153\nAnd so depending on\nthe performance that you need,\n\n58\n00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.502\nreally depends how many zeros\nyou can put on your PL.\n\n59\n00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:56.083\nRight?\n\n60\n00:02:56.083 --> 00:03:00.003\nSo if you have even more, if you have\neven more zeros on your PL, you can get\n\n61\n00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:04.325\nthe appliance, so why would I need an\nappliance over the ASA is more throughput.\n\n62\n00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:04.847\nRight?\n\n63\n00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:07.429\nSo there's gonna be a little\nbit more money there,\n\n64\n00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.142\nbut we need more throughput,\nmore inspection done.\n\n65\n00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.415\nAnd so basically we wanna\ntalk about these terms here.\n\n66\n00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:19.430\nWhat are some of these terms that are so\nimportant that seem to change everyday?\n\n67\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.420\nAnd some of these are firePOWER.\n\n68\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.240\nAnd you see how the POWER is capitalized.\n\n69\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.947\nSame fireSIGHT and fireAMP.\n\n70\n00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:28.251\nAnd these terms were created by\nSourcefire when they came out with\n\n71\n00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:29.903\nthe 5-2 code mostly.\n\n72\n00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:32.985\nBut the fact is the definitions\nat that time for\n\n73\n00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.936\nfirePOWER were hey it's the power\nof the engine, per say,\n\n74\n00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:41.455\nthat runs the next generation firewall,\nthe next generation IPS.\n\n75\n00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.836\nSo what does that mean?\n\n76\n00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:47.309\nWell, the next generation firewall is\nbasically where we're saying, hey we\n\n77\n00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.575\nare next generation IPS where we can\njust look at all the data, watch it come\n\n78\n00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:55.939\nthrough in real time, and it's considered\nsomewhat a bump in the wire now.\n\n79\n00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.011\nIt does take some of our throughput,\nsome of our bandwidth away for sure, but\n\n80\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:06.016\nwe're getting truly in inspect the data,\nand better than ever in history.\n\n81\n00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:10.660\nSo, the firePOWER is the power\nof the next generation firewall.\n\n82\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.275\nRight?\n\n83\n00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:13.574\nFireSIGHT is a very powerful technology.\n\n84\n00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:14.201\nI love it.\n\n85\n00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:15.489\nWe'll go through this.\n\n86\n00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.581\nIt's a passive, not an active,\n\n87\n00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:22.153\na passive technology that's collecting\ninformation on your network.\n\n88\n00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:26.161\nUsers, databases, applications,\noperating systems, protocols, and\n\n89\n00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:28.048\nthis puts this all in the database.\n\n90\n00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:32.666\nSo when something occurs, I know who\nit occurred to and what they did,\n\n91\n00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:38.235\nwhere they went and all this information,\nand so it's a very powerful database.\n\n92\n00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:42.758\nNow we can add, what you guys remember\nthat snort is an open source, so\n\n93\n00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:46.205\nwe can add third party\napps in this very easily.\n\n94\n00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:50.125\nAnd so for example, a lot of people\nuse like Nmap as an active scanner, so\n\n95\n00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.203\nwe don't just have passive scanning.\n\n96\n00:04:52.203 --> 00:04:55.362\nNow with fireSIGHT technologies we\ncan also have active scanning and\n\n97\n00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:56.455\nget real time threats.\n\n98\n00:04:56.455 --> 00:05:01.459\nAnd then the last thing here is fireAMP,\nadvanced malware protection.\n\n99\n00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.964\nAnd this is the key to\nreally a high success here.\n\n100\n00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:07.763\nYou've got the power of\nthe next generation IPS.\n\n101\n00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:10.355\nYou've got FireSIGHT database technology,\n\n102\n00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:15.216\nfinding powerful information about your\nnetwork, and now we're stopping malware.\n\n103\n00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:16.749\nSo is that important?\n\n104\n00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.593\nIt's the most important piece because\nwhat's our biggest threat today is\n\n105\n00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:23.227\nnot viruses, it's not Trojans,\nit's Malware.\n\n106\n00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:24.877\nRight?\nThat's how we get things like\n\n107\n00:05:24.877 --> 00:05:25.631\nsay Ransomware.\n\n108\n00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:30.086\nNetwork comes in very small sizes,\nor somewhat medium sizes, but\n\n109\n00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:35.347\nwe can get them in apps, very small, but\nmalware is our biggest threat today.\n\n110\n00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:38.959\nAnd so this helps us take care\nof the largest threats today.\n\n111\n00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:41.135\nAnd again we'll talk about\nRansomware later, but\n\n112\n00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:42.963\nthen that's a piece of Malware isn't it?\n\n113\n00:05:42.963 --> 00:05:46.659\n>> Now, in the slide here we can see\nall the pictures of ASA is there and\n\n114\n00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.765\npretty much all the exposure I have\nwith firePOWER or has been with an ASA.\n\n115\n00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:53.224\nHas Cisco expanded to any of\nthe other product lines, or\n\n116\n00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:54.804\nis it all within the ASAs right now?\n\n117\n00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.581\n>> That's a really good question.\n\n118\n00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:59.629\nI haven't seen anything yet,\nbut I've heard a lot, and\n\n119\n00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.205\nactually I've searched on their website,\nbecause I had heard of some firePOWER, so\n\n120\n00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:06.970\nlet me come back to these\nsince you brought that up.\n\n121\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.410\nSo the, the terms firePOWER,\n\n122\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.430\nfireSIGHT, fireAMP, I gave you their\noriginal technical definitions.\n\n123\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.612\nNow that was before Cisco bought them,\nand they're still true today.\n\n124\n00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:17.583\nHowever, Cisco now doesn't\nuse the word Sourcefire, so\n\n125\n00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.976\nI'll use the word sourcefire a lot,\nand it's in my book a lot, and\n\n126\n00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:23.785\nI use some of the other,\nwhat we'll call older terms.\n\n127\n00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:26.923\nBut firePOWER now is,\nis what Cisco's going to,\n\n128\n00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:30.450\nthe term is just this technology\nin a whole, in a group.\n\n129\n00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.679\nSo firePOWER is gonna have\nmany different meanings.\n\n130\n00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:35.444\nIt gets kinda hard,\nbecause since Cisco bought this,\n\n131\n00:06:35.444 --> 00:06:38.579\nit seems to be changing every\nweek when I was writing the book.\n\n132\n00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:39.961\nI'm like, well, what do I call this now?\n\n133\n00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:42.979\nAnd so I kinda make the decision,\nI'm gonna use firePOWER and Sourcefire and\n\n134\n00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.220\nDefense Center and\nwe'll go though some of these terms.\n\n135\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.118\nBut the fact is you gotta kinda\nhave to sit on this term,\n\n136\n00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:50.764\nbecause we should see this coming out and\nsaying,\n\n137\n00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:54.680\nif we are talking about this next\ngeneration firewall that Cisco bought.\n\n138\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.690\nAnd they're putting it on a ISO router,\n\n139\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.930\nwhich is their future now, probably\ncoming up within the next few months.\n\n140\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.906\nThey are gonna be calling it\nfirePOWER services again.\n\n141\n00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:06.654\nAnd there's supposedly notice that\nfirePOWER is capitalized with a power\n\n142\n00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:09.747\ncapitalize, we'll see this as\njust a capital F firepower and\n\n143\n00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:11.783\nit's gonna mean the whole collection.\n\n144\n00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:12.461\nRight?\nThat's kind\n\n145\n00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:14.063\nof where we're looking at this.\n\n146\n00:07:14.063 --> 00:07:18.697\nBut, see, the other thing fireSIGHT again\nis gonna be a marketing term because we\n\n147\n00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:23.085\nsay things like fireSIGHT Administration,\nfireSIGHT Management center.\n\n148\n00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:26.103\nAll right, and really what does that mean?\n\n149\n00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:28.503\nI don't know really anymore,\nso firePOWER, fireSIGHT,\n\n150\n00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:30.143\nI gave you their original definitions.\n\n151\n00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:30.944\nWe'll kind of stick with that.\n\n152\n00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:34.322\nBut will see them also used in\nmarketing and we will see them.\n\n153\n00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:37.197\nCisco's whole goal is, and\nthis is why this is important to you,\n\n154\n00:07:37.197 --> 00:07:39.674\nis Cisco's whole goal is that\nthis is on every product.\n\n155\n00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:41.882\nRight?\nKind of like a chicken in every pot, and\n\n156\n00:07:41.882 --> 00:07:43.993\na firePOWER in every Cisco\ndevice in the world.\n\n157\n00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:48.567\nAnd I think we'll see that from our Soho\nall the way up to our extreme enterprise\n\n158\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.269\nnetworks.\n\n159\n00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.792\n>> Also, now, when we go to implement\nsomething like this, I know most of the X\n\n160\n00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:58.766\nseries ASAs have it, and not like the\nvenerable 5505s that you saw branch off.\n\n161\n00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:03.010\nTo offices all around the world but\nthe 5506X's and higher, they've got it but\n\n162\n00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.340\nthen, inside of that, there's a lot of\ndifferent modules and components, right?\n\n163\n00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.860\nIt gets pretty complex pretty fast, which\nis why we need a show like this, right?\n\n164\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.780\n>> Yeah.\nIt does and\n\n165\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.060\nthey have it and\nyou'll see that when I go through and\n\n166\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.380\ndo the installation that I'm uninstalling\nother modules within my ASA.\n\n167\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.094\nAnd I use a lower-end model for\ncourses and\n\n168\n00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:26.460\ndemonstrations an dmy the 5506 works\ngreat for something like that.\n\n169\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.350\nAnd it would be great for a small network,\nbut if you think about this,\n\n170\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.330\nhere we have this ASA and\nyou've got the power of VPN,\n\n171\n00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.680\nrouting, switching, the power of that and\nthe ASA and the firewall, right?\n\n172\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.610\nAnd now we're adding this to it and\nit makes it, no one else can match this.\n\n173\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.580\nNot Palo Alto systems, not McAfee.\n\n174\n00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.650\nCan they do some of this?\n\n175\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.850\nThey can do some of this, but\nthey can't do all of it and\n\n176\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.050\nthey can't do it the way Cisco does\nit with the ease of simplicity\n\n177\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.190\nof one management screen which\nI'm gonna show you in a minute.\n\n178\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.770\n>> Awesome.\n\n179\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.670\nWell, let's get started.\n\n180\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.250\n>> Let's dig.\n>> What do we got now?\n\n181\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.200\n>> Let's dig in.\n\n182\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.090\nOkay.\nSo, the first thing I want to tell you\n\n183\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.455\nguys is basically, this is Cisco's future\nso, they spent a lot of money on this\n\n184\n00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:11.010\n$3.2 billion to acquire this and they\nimmediately had came out on the ASA so\n\n185\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.950\nobviously, we know they were working\non it as they were finalizing the deal.\n\n186\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.100\nBut, the fact is,\nas they do plan like I've mentioned,\n\n187\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.270\nthey plan on putting this on\na lot of different devices.\n\n188\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.620\nAnd so understanding this is critical.\n\n189\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.370\nIf you're managing any\ntype of Cisco network,\n\n190\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.070\nthis is gonna be your future of security.\n\n191\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.470\nAgain, we want to think about\nthis in the big picture.\n\n192\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.520\nThis is Snort, just basic Linux Snort,\nand with a GUI though,\n\n193\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.490\nwhich makes it really adaptive,\nfriendly, and easy to use.\n\n194\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.330\nNow that being said,\nwhen people come in to your office,\n\n195\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.410\nI go to people they would call me all the\ntime and are writing me, help me, help me!\n\n196\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.160\nBecause their salesman goes in there and\nsays, hey just put this in and\n\n197\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.770\nit'll work and it'll help your network.\n\n198\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.380\nAnd the answer is that's mostly true,\nbut not completely true about anything.\n\n199\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.960\nWhen everyone tells you something, the\ntruth is always somewhere in the middle.\n\n200\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.300\nAnd in the case,\nthat's gonna be true here.\n\n201\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.160\nWe'll put the box out there,\n\n202\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.570\nit'll show you malware on your network\nwithout a doubt, it will find problems.\n\n203\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.190\nIt just won't fix them until you go\nout and do something about it, right?\n\n204\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.890\nSo we need to remember that this is\nconsidered a look down here next\n\n205\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.890\ngeneration IPS.\n\n206\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.860\nIt gives us what's called\napplication visibility control.\n\n207\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.890\nSo, not only are we just looking at the\napplication, but we have to look further\n\n208\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.290\nin there, we have to understand\nwhat's going on with an application.\n\n209\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.440\nAnd this FireSIGHT, and the FirePOWER and\nthe power that comes with\n\n210\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.430\nthe next generation firewall gives\nus this control and this visibility.\n\n211\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.290\nThe other thing that we\nget is URL filtering.\n\n212\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.250\nNow, there's other products that do\nURL filtering, I'm not saying hey,\n\n213\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.220\ndrop everything that you have if you have\nsome sort or URL filter and then buy this.\n\n214\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.480\nAnd, again, I don;t work for Cisco, so\n\n215\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.990\nI'm not going to sit up here and\nbe some marketing band.\n\n216\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.680\nThe fact is is there's some parts\nof this that work phenomenally and\n\n217\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.395\nit's worth your time and I still think\nthis is the best product out there.\n\n218\n00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:53.155\nThere's some parts that work\nmediocre like this URL filter,\n\n219\n00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:54.805\nI can get working most of the time.\n\n220\n00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:59.125\nSo I'll be very truthful and forward\nwith you on where I see this product at.\n\n221\n00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.425\nBut I can't beat the AMP.\n\n222\n00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.570\nYou can't beat the malware protection,\nbar none.\n\n223\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.540\nNone.\nSo the next-generation\n\n224\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.310\nfirewall in the AMP, and\nthere's application control.\n\n225\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.340\nWe can't beat that,\n\n226\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.820\nso its benefits outweighs some of\nthe problems that might occur.\n\n227\n00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.180\nNo product is perfect but this comes\nreally darn close to being a great,\n\n228\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.330\nperfect product.\n\n229\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.720\nNow, the next bullet point is\nwhy I brought this screen up so\n\n230\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.240\nI didn't forget to mention this to you.\n\n231\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.930\nBy default, we're looking at\nclear text traffic, right?\n\n232\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.370\nWe're looking at traffic coming\nthrough that's not encrypted.\n\n233\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.440\nAll right.\nSo on the ASAs,\n\n234\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.670\nthat's the only thing I can do.\n\n235\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.370\nHowever, Sourcefire had,\nand now Cisco has,\n\n236\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.410\nthese third party boxes that sit outside\nand we decrypt the traffic as it comes in.\n\n237\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.600\nWe inspect it and then re-encrypt it.\n\n238\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.210\nIt's very cumbersome and difficult\nto set up, but you may have to do.\n\n239\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.340\nDo that, and certainly that's\nthe future of what you will have to do,\n\n240\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.760\nbut you might not have to do it right now.\n\n241\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.210\nThe fact is you need a public key.\n\n242\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.640\nYou need a private key.\n\n243\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.340\nYou don't have to re-encrypted it.\n\n244\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.810\nYou need a certificate of authority.\n\n245\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.225\nIt's cumbersome.\n\n246\n00:11:58.225 --> 00:12:01.100\nIt's difficult, but it might be necessary.\n\n247\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.100\nNow, in the next, in the code coming out,\n\n248\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.780\nthe 6.0 code, the ASA's will be able to do\nthis internally, and with the appliances\n\n249\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.770\nthat I showed you, where they have more,\nyou have more processing.\n\n250\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.830\nThey can also do this as well,\nand decrypt, and encrypt and\n\n251\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.070\nredo the key and so on.\n\n252\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.090\nJust remember that it might not be\na bad thing to keep these outside boxes\n\n253\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.710\ndown to take the processing off your\nASA regardless if it can do it or not,\n\n254\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.070\nit's a lot of processes you can imagine.\n\n255\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:26.630\nOkay?\n\n256\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.390\nAnd remember this isn't an ASA class but\nif you\n\n257\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:34.200\nguys understand what context mode is this\nallows us to work in multi context mode.\n\n258\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.830\nYou would get something like this and\nsee it when I'm on an Edge ISP and\n\n259\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.340\ncustomers like that.\n\n260\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.370\nAnd we take a 55/85 and\nwe break it up into multiple customers.\n\n261\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.230\nRight?\nAnd it\n\n262\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.010\nmakes a bigger box into four\ndifferent smaller boxes, for example.\n\n263\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.750\nAnd this Sourcefire works within there and\n\n264\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.940\nI create great policies to\nwork within these context.\n\n265\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.590\nSo it's very cool.\n\n266\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.540\nIt might be a little above what\nI wanted to discuss here today.\n\n267\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.570\nBut nonetheless just to\nlet you know it's there.\n\n268\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.970\nAs we go through here, you'll see that\nthe module within the ASA is called SFR,\n\n269\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.090\nstanding for Sourcefire, so in this\ncase here we're still gonna use the term\n\n270\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.610\nSourcefire, and I'm sure that we'll use\nSourcefire for a long time to come.\n\n271\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.050\nAnd we manage this through something,\nI'll show it to you here.\n\n272\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.750\nLet me get over here.\n\n273\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.890\nHere.\nHere.\n\n274\n00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.820\nCome on.\n\n275\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.270\nAnd it looks like this.\n\n276\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.550\nActually, this might be a better screen.\n\n277\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.620\nLet me take this off and go here.\n\n278\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.215\nThis one's like a network that's just\nbeing attacked constantly, right?\n\n279\n00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:29.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me tell you something.\n\n280\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.040\nIf your network looks like this, you need\nto go out to your network and unplug your\n\n281\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.520\nInternet, because it's like world war\nthree just hit your network here.\n\n282\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.590\nAll right, you are in deep, deep trouble.\n\n283\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.770\nAnd I'll show you what you know\nyour network should look like.\n\n284\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.320\nThis is my network, right, you see a\ncouple of tacks coming in here and you can\n\n285\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.170\ncome over here and we'll come in here and\ntake a look at this, and we'll right click\n\n286\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.920\nand we'll drill down and we'll go\nthrough all of this and how to fix this.\n\n287\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.330\nThis is typically what you should see.\n\n288\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.290\nThe key is that I always tell my\ncustomers, hey you're on this screen,\n\n289\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.850\nit's called context explorer, this is\nwhat they also call the the FMC now,\n\n290\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.870\nor Firesight Management Center.\n\n291\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.350\nSo again, it went from the term Defense\nCenter and to Firesight Management Center.\n\n292\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.800\nSo what does that mean?\n\n293\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.660\nWell, it means whatever\nthey want it to mean today.\n\n294\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.045\nBut the fact is this is\nwhere we do our work.\n\n295\n00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:15.535\nThis is what manages, depending on\nhow many manage devices you have.\n\n296\n00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:17.445\nThis is the model that you get.\n\n297\n00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:19.685\nYou could get,\nthis is a virtual appliance, but\n\n298\n00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:22.155\nyou can get physical appliances,\nand why would I do that?\n\n299\n00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:23.845\nWell you got to remember that,\n\n300\n00:14:23.845 --> 00:14:26.155\nall the data has to go through here\nto the defence center, to the FMC.\n\n301\n00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:28.725\nAnd I'll keep saying defence center,\nI'm an old school guy.\n\n302\n00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:32.125\nBut the fact is, is that all that\ndata has got to go through there, so\n\n303\n00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:33.830\nhow much processing do you need.\n\n304\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.600\nHow many appliances do you have,\nand managed devices do you have?\n\n305\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.760\nSo a managed device again is defined\nas the module within the ASA,\n\n306\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.100\nor the actual physical appliance\nthat's in your network.\n\n307\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.400\nWhich one do you buy again depends on\ntwo things, how much money you have and\n\n308\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.350\nhow much throughput that,\ninspected throughput that you need.\n\n309\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.830\nBecause if I have an ASA and\nI'm doing SSL decryption,\n\n310\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.820\nI could be taking 90%\nof my bandwidth away.\n\n311\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.960\nAnd that might be okay because in\n\n312\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.350\nsecurity over connectivity\nis what we call that, right?\n\n313\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.040\nSo, or maybe we want\nconnectivity over security and\n\n314\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.700\nI'm going to show you how to configure\na network so it works in your environment.\n\n315\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.190\nAnd the key is about this, and I was just\ntalking to Don before we started here,\n\n316\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.680\nthis isn't like a router,\nwhere you go out and just put it in and\n\n317\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.860\nthey're all doing the same thing, breaking\nup broadcast domains, and creating and\n\n318\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.720\nconnecting LANs and stuff like that.\n\n319\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.710\nThese are are all configured differently\nfor every different network.\n\n320\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.130\nThis is why people always ask me in\nclass or when I go out and consult,\n\n321\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.170\nhey I need a network guide.\n\n322\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.920\nHow do I install it?\n\n323\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.792\nAnd Cisco doesn't have that.\n\n324\n00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:32.441\nThey will never put that out.\n\n325\n00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:36.341\nThey say, this is done on a per network\nbasis and we have to understand it.\n\n326\n00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:41.540\nSo their answer is,\nwell hire our Cisco advance services.\n\n327\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.500\nRight at $20,000 an hour or\nwhatever it is.\n\n328\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.620\nAnd so we'll come out and\ndesign it for you, that's basically,\n\n329\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.390\nthey can't give you an answer, because\neverything's going to be different.\n\n330\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.770\nAnd that's where we're at, right?\n\n331\n00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.420\nSo I can give you guys an overview,\n\n332\n00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.700\nand I'm gonna give you something that will\nset you up and get you on path to success.\n\n333\n00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.210\nSo I have done a lot of installs\nin the last couple of years.\n\n334\n00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.080\nAnd I've done work with\na lot of companies.\n\n335\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.970\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, bring all of\nthat knowledge that I've gained when\n\n336\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.430\nwriting the book, and\nconsulting, and training.\n\n337\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.990\nAnd I'm gonna give that to you,\nand say, look.\n\n338\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.580\nThis is the best way\nthat I've found to go.\n\n339\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.430\nIn a big picture,\nthis is where you want to start and\n\n340\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.650\nthen tweak it according to your network.\n\n341\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.020\nBut when in doubt, I'll give you the\nminimum that you need to do to get this\n\n342\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.060\nup and running, and\nget working on your network.\n\n343\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.520\nAnd that's where we're at today.\n\n344\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.670\nWhat do I need to do to get\nthis working on my network,\n\n345\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.240\nto understand it,\nto put it out into my enterprise?\n\n346\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.470\nIs to help me, and maybe even to\nexplain to my boss or bosses, or\n\n347\n00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.660\nwhatever, what does this do and\nwhy do we need it?\n\n348\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.534\nAll right,\nall of that you're going to come out and,\n\n349\n00:16:39.534 --> 00:16:41.670\nmaybe I'm gonna overwhelm you\nby the time we're done here.\n\n350\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.620\nSo that definitely happens in some of\nthe classes I teach, regardless who it is.\n\n351\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.250\nThey sit there going,\nwow, this is in depth.\n\n352\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.400\nI'm looking at this going, well, they're\nnaked, and all simple, and everything.\n\n353\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.215\nOn the front that's true,\nin the back end, it's very complicated.\n\n354\n00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:57.305\nWe're gonna start seeing things, and\ntalking about different policies,\n\n355\n00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:01.755\nand snort rules, and thresholds,\nand out of enablement, and\n\n356\n00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:05.445\nfix these problems that we see on our\nscreen, and go through all of this.\n\n357\n00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:09.185\nSo if you go along with me for this ride,\nat the end you're gonna go, woo!\n\n358\n00:17:09.185 --> 00:17:11.430\nWhat a ride, do I get to the ad right?\n\n359\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.900\nSo we're gonna learn a lot about firepower\nhere and let me tell you something,\n\n360\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.640\nevery time I work on this,\nI learn something new everyday.\n\n361\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.180\nIt's exciting.\n\n362\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.890\nIt's new and I love it.\n\n363\n00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.050\nAs you know, I'm a [INAUDIBLE]\ndata center and wireless guy,\n\n364\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.580\nbut when I started working on this one,\nI was like,\n\n365\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.440\n\"This is an exciting technology that\nI can get behind.\" And honestly,\n\n366\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.830\nI didn't mean for it to kind of take over\nmy life, but it's almost all that I do.\n\n367\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.270\nNow, I still have a lot of wireless\nconsulting and other jobs, but\n\n368\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.050\nthe fact is, is this is my baby.\n\n369\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.050\nThis is what I come up and\n\n370\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.250\nwant to do everyday because\nthat's how exciting it is.\n\n371\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.720\nAll right, so let's go back to these\nslides here, and see where we're at here.\n\n372\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720\nLet's talk about some terms.\n\n373\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.020\nSo the old terms looks sort Sourcefire,\nright?\n\n374\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.270\nAnd now we're gonna use the term\nCisco most of the time.\n\n375\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.840\nNow, within a few years, I'm sure Cisco's\ndoing everything they can to push that\n\n376\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.330\nword, Sourcefire, away, but\nwe'll still know what it means.\n\n377\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.970\nIt means this product in a whole.\n\n378\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.650\nThat was the company name, right?\n\n379\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.240\nAnd then we've got,\nSourcefire Defence center.\n\n380\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.130\nThis was the name for multiple years.\n\n381\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:17.550\nAnd Cisco changed that when they brought\nit to FireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n382\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.590\nFMC or FSMC, I'm not sure how\nwe'll say it tomorrow, but\n\n383\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.560\nthat's how we're saying it today.\n\n384\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.420\nNow, when I started\nworking the SourceFire,\n\n385\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.650\nthey called these devices that\nwere in the field, sensors.\n\n386\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.120\nAnd I kind of like that,\nright where, watching.\n\n387\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.710\nThat we're inspecting those\nthreads as they come through and\n\n388\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.470\nthe applications, and so on.\n\n389\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.150\nWe're sensing the data, but\nthey changed that disc to device.\n\n390\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.300\nNow, we typically, I typically,\ndon't use the word device,\n\n391\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.180\nbecause it's kind of like saying, If I was\nworking on TCPIP, I'd use the word node.\n\n392\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.710\nWhat does that mean, right?\n\n393\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.460\nIt's just, it's a general, large term.\n\n394\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.050\nIn this case here, I'm gonna use the term,\nyou'll hear it as managed device.\n\n395\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.780\nSo that's going to be any\nsource of fire power,\n\n396\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.660\nwhatever, you want to call it,\nmodule in an ASA or the appliance.\n\n397\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.580\nSo if I say managed device,\nit could be both.\n\n398\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.230\nOr it could have ASA's out there,\nI could have appliances and\n\n399\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.920\nthey'll go into my FireSIGHT\nmanagement center.\n\n400\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.230\nI can manage dozens of them,\n\n401\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.640\ndepending on model, from one fire site\nmanagement center after the scene.\n\n402\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.370\nWe also see the appliances.\n\n403\n00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.110\nYou'll still see them\na Sourcefire 3D Systems, right.\n\n404\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.490\nI won't say the ASA ever called this,\n\n405\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.180\nbut the appliance itself, you'll see\nSourcefire 3, you'll see 3D System,\n\n406\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.650\nthat's actually to the prompt that\ncomes up, and we'll see that today.\n\n407\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.310\nWe'll still see a 3D system out there.\n\n408\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.540\nThey are changing the fire site\nsystem in the names change, like,\n\n409\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.000\nI'll get a new code, or an update,\nand all of a sudden, I don't see,\n\n410\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.590\nlike their banner used to say, Sourcefire\nand then one time, I got an update and\n\n411\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.170\nthey changed the banner to Cisco.\n\n412\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.930\nTheir logo just with Cisco,\nyou just never know.\n\n413\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.680\n>> And if you've been working with Cisco\na long time you've seen this before.\n\n414\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.470\nLike the Cisco picks firewalls and\neventually, became the ASA's,\n\n415\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.080\npics was the name of the company.\n\n416\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.080\nAnd they kind of renamed that.\n\n417\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.810\nI guess, there's some where they keep,\nlike Aironet, Meraki,\n\n418\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.490\nthey kind-of kept the old name.\n\n419\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.350\nThis is, yeah, any acquisition\nthey wanna put their brand on.\n\n420\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.760\n>> Yes. Yeah. I don't blame them.\n\n421\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.762\nI spend $3.2 billion,\nI want it named after me.\n\n422\n00:19:58.762 --> 00:19:59.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Please.\n\n423\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.460\nAll right.\n\n424\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.780\nNow, these are policies.\n\n425\n00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.700\nRight?\nSo, are these important to us?\n\n426\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.640\nThis is kinda what we do.\n\n427\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.450\nSo, I'll go on to a company,\nand people say,\n\n428\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.630\nhey I want you to design and\nimplement our File Policy, or whatever.\n\n429\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.870\nAnd I'm like, okay,\nI need your Security Policy.\n\n430\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.700\nSecurity Policy?\n\n431\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.506\nYou know, can you go to Facebook,\nthat's a common thing I get as an example.\n\n432\n00:20:29.506 --> 00:20:31.940\nAnd I'll use a,\nwas when I was blocking Facebook, so\n\n433\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.160\nI like to be kind of mean to my users and\nblock social media and stuff like that,\n\n434\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.650\nand it's kind of really easy to do and\nkind of fun.\n\n435\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.860\nIt give me the power so\nit makes me feel good.\n\n436\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.140\nBut, the fact is, that we do all this and\n\n437\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.055\nwe run our manage devices\nthrough policies.\n\n438\n00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:51.935\nAnd we used to do them by creating\ntext files and pushing these out one\n\n439\n00:20:51.935 --> 00:20:56.725\nby one right, and the fact is now what\ni do is i create some policies and\n\n440\n00:20:56.725 --> 00:21:00.145\nI push them out to the managed device\nfrom the FireSIGHT Management Center so\n\n441\n00:21:00.145 --> 00:21:04.040\ni have a single point of management and\na single point of configuration.\n\n442\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.241\nAnd that's what makes this great.\n\n443\n00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:08.057\nSo when we look at these\nwe have a main policy, and\n\n444\n00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:10.482\nthis is called my access control policy.\n\n445\n00:21:10.482 --> 00:21:13.032\nNow, I don't have to have any\nof these other policies, but\n\n446\n00:21:13.032 --> 00:21:14.157\nI Gonna have to have that.\n\n447\n00:21:14.157 --> 00:21:17.670\nThe fact is, that we will have all of\nthese, and I will push these all out.\n\n448\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.560\nAnd I'm gonna give the minimum\nto get this running, so\n\n449\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.820\nyou can go out to your network,\nwhatever it is.\n\n450\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.374\nWhen you leave here,\nwhen you finish this series.\n\n451\n00:21:25.374 --> 00:21:28.470\n[INAUDIBLE] then you will\nbe able to implement this.\n\n452\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.490\nAnd then, you'll just grow in your\nknowledge as you get in the the book and\n\n453\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.420\nwe'll do more modules on the series.\n\n454\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.430\nBut nonetheless, what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna create a file.\n\n455\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.520\nSo you're gonna see me do\nsomething in a certain direction.\n\n456\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.640\nAnd what I did is, I learned,\n\n457\n00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.570\nwhat is the most efficient way to\nimplement this product at my customers.\n\n458\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.240\nAnd it It took me awhile to kind of get\ninto a rhythm of understanding some\n\n459\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.590\nbasics, so here's how I start,\nhere's a foundation, and then I change it.\n\n460\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.060\nSo the first thing I do is, I go create\na file policy, or a Malware policy.\n\n461\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:58.900\nI create it now.\n\n462\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.200\nCreating a policy doesn't do anything.\n\n463\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.910\nAt that point,\nI'm just saying for example,\n\n464\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.530\nwhat do we do with PDFs when they come in?\n\n465\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.390\nSo, I'm going to look for file types\nas they come into our network, and\n\n466\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.050\nwe're gonna decide what kinda file it is\nand what action to take on that file.\n\n467\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.920\nMaybe, we'll just look up to\nsee if it has malware, or\n\n468\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.080\nmaybe we'll just block it completely.\n\n469\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.670\nFor example, I have some customers\nthat say I don't want any exes coming.\n\n470\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.250\nSo we just block those, even if they're in\na zip file, whatever, we can see that and\n\n471\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.130\nwe can block all of those.\n\n472\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.970\nOr we want EXEs coming in, but we wanna\ncheck them to make sure they're fine.\n\n473\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.520\nThat takes some time, but they do,\nthey get the file first, the fact is,\n\n474\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.330\nyou're transferring this file\nwhile we're looking, and\n\n475\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.490\nwe'll talk about this file policy.\n\n476\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.120\nBut so it creeped out, and\nthen I come back and I create basically,\n\n477\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.950\nmy SNORT Rules, my IPS policy,\nmy intrusion policy, and\n\n478\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.950\nthis basically say's,\nwhat SNORT Rules are enabled.\n\n479\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:50.280\nThe fact is, it would be great to just\nsay, all SNORT Rules are enabled.\n\n480\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.450\nBut we have about 25,000 SNORT rules,\nand they add to it everyday.\n\n481\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:59.820\nAnd so it downloads and comes into your\nbox and that updates your SNORT rules.\n\n482\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.820\nIf you were to do that and enable all\nthese SNORT rules, then basically,\n\n483\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.430\nyou might as well just\nunplug the box because no\n\n484\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.980\ndata's going to get through\nbecause we're going to spend so\n\n485\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.140\nmuch time looking through these various\nheaders for different keywords.\n\n486\n00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:18.130\nAt this point, now I have a file pulse\nin IPS Don't do anything at this point.\n\n487\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.810\nSo I've created this and\nsaid what SNORT rules, how do I want them,\n\n488\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.310\ndo I threshold them, do I suppress them?\n\n489\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.680\nIf I see this SNORT Rule, is it triggered,\ndo I drop the packet, will it alert me?\n\n490\n00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.450\nI decide all this stuff and I show you\nhow to do this, and how to automate this,\n\n491\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.270\nand that's the key.\n\n492\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.370\nSo we have our Fire Policy in there and\nour Intrusion Policy.\n\n493\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.200\nPolicy, and then we're gonna go and\ncreate an access control policy.\n\n494\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.280\nAnd think about this kind\nof like a big access list.\n\n495\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.410\nAnd inside that access list, now we'll add\nour intrusion policy and our file policy.\n\n496\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.600\nNow, once that's done, and\nthat's my minimum here,\n\n497\n00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.080\nI will push those out\nto the managed devices,\n\n498\n00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.110\nand I can use the same access-control\npolicy for all of my managed devices.\n\n499\n00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:00.020\nOr, I can create an access-control policy\nfor every single manager's device.\n\n500\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:06.470\nThey key is, though, you can only have one\naccess control policy on a manged device.\n\n501\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.740\nSo, I create one access control policy and\n\n502\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.130\nsend it out to a managed device,\nand inside there is my basic rules,\n\n503\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.620\nmy URL filtering, and my IPS,\nmy SNORT rules, my file policies.\n\n504\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.590\nAnd I push those out and manage those.\n\n505\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.150\nIt's a very easy way to manage this.\n\n506\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.830\nOnce you do it a couple of times,\nyou'll see how easy it is.\n\n507\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.760\n>> And it's far easier than\nediting SNORT configuration files,\n\n508\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.910\nbecause if you've ever done that,\nit's not particularly user friendly and\n\n509\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.980\nvery hard to maintain and keep up.\n\n510\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.300\n>> It exactly is, and based on that, when\nwe hit a zero day attack, you're sitting\n\n511\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.290\nthere looking at it and you have to\ncreate a text file and a SNORT Rule, and\n\n512\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.460\nthen you have to implement that,\nand that's how it was done.\n\n513\n00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.450\nAnd now we can do it where this product\ncan do it can see the zero day attack,\n\n514\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.000\nand it can remediate the issue\nright away by itself.\n\n515\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.580\nIf you If you configure\neverything correctly.\n\n516\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.080\nThat takes a little bit more effort.\n\n517\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.920\nBut if we were to go through there and\ndo all of the configuration,\n\n518\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.010\nthen this product can help us\nin real time to stop problems.\n\n519\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.480\nAnd that's really what it is.\n\n520\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.360\nSo we wanna think of the word IPS, right?\n\n521\n00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.540\nIntrusion Prevention System.\n\n522\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.280\nWe understand that it can stop problems\nin contrast to IDS, the old term.\n\n523\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.950\nIntrusion.\nprotection just alerted us.\n\n524\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:14.530\nIDS always kind of cracked me up as a\nterm, because basically in the late '90s,\n\n525\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.410\nand so way in the IDS and the 2000's and\nit would page you, or email you and\n\n526\n00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.010\nbasically just said hey I hope you\nupdated Your resume because of,\n\n527\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.357\nyou're not going to believe\nwhat just happened to you.\n\n528\n00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:25.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what IDS does,\n\n529\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.340\nIt kind of mocks you.\n\n530\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.630\nWell we don't use IDS ever anymore.\n\n531\n00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:34.020\nSo now that doesn't mean we don't\ndo IPS in monitor mode, right?\n\n532\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.300\nAnd that's really what the old IDS is.\n\n533\n00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.780\nBut we don't use the term IDS anymore,\nbecause we have the technology and\n\n534\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.370\nthe throughput to be able\nto do IPS all the time.\n\n535\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.720\nYou can put this in monitor only mode,\n\n536\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.740\nwe don't recommend it because\nyou're buying this product and\n\n537\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.760\nyou're putting it in monitor only mode,\nyou're just wasting your money.\n\n538\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.330\nSo I get customers that\nbasically will never\n\n539\n00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.280\ntake this out of monitor only mode, and\nI'm just like, you've got to do this This.\n\n540\n00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.800\nAnd they just refuse to,\nbecause they know the phone will ring.\n\n541\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.440\nAbsolutely it will ring because\nif you go and turn this on.\n\n542\n00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.730\nAnd you turn on the rules and\nyour file policy and you push this access\n\n543\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:13.280\ncontrol out with policy with rules in\nthere, that dictate some sort of changes.\n\n544\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.420\nAnd you're all filtering and\napplication controls, saying, hey.\n\n545\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.620\nPeople can't go to social media.\n\n546\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.870\nWhatever it is.\nThey're gonna get phone calls.\n\n547\n00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:19.630\nAnd they.\n\n548\n00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.800\nThey don't want to get phone calls.\n\n549\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.980\nThey'd rather be reactive\ninstead of proactive.\n\n550\n00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.450\nAnd that's just the way\nsome people will be.\n\n551\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.780\nI think it's a waste of money.\n\n552\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.310\nAfter we finish this access control\npolicy, we're gonna come back and do\n\n553\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.390\nthe network discovery policy, and that's\nthe FireSIGHT I was telling you about.\n\n554\n00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.790\nNow why don't I do that before?\n\n555\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.290\nBecause until my network is configured and\nmy policies are out,\n\n556\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.090\nI can't discover the network.\n\n557\n00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.380\nSo if I was to put that out,\nI would see errors.\n\n558\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.140\nIt's not a Big deal,\nmy network's not down, but\n\n559\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.330\nit does give you errors and\nmy task managers will see that saying hey,\n\n560\n00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.400\nI'm trying to look at your network,\nbut you don't have one.\n\n561\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.690\nYou know, I don't have any data, so\nit's going to give me weird errors.\n\n562\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.880\nIt took me a while to figure it out that\nyou get things like wrong snort version,\n\n563\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.280\nand you're like what?\n\n564\n00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.900\nYou know?\nSo anyways, so\n\n565\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.980\nwe're going to kind of do it Of order.\n\n566\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.530\nAnd then, but we've.\n\n567\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.630\nActually, before we do any of those,\nlet me step back a little bit.\n\n568\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.330\nWe're going to do something called\nthe System and Health Policy.\n\n569\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.230\nNow, these aren't going to make your\nnetwork run better or anything like that.\n\n570\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.600\nWhat they do is they help you\nmanage the devices in a whole.\n\n571\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.890\nSo, if we come back here and\nI take a look here, at this here, and\n\n572\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.160\nlet's see how well we can see this.\n\n573\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.910\nSo.\nIf I look here at the top, and\n\n574\n00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.760\nit might be hard for you guys to see,\nso I'll make this as big as possible.\n\n575\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.230\nThere, this is what we want to see.\n\n576\n00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.350\nOver here on my Fireside\nmanagement defense center,\n\n577\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.350\nthese are kind of like my day-to-day\nthings I'm going to work on.\n\n578\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.240\nThis is how I do my policies, here's\nhow I add my manage devices into here.\n\n579\n00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.270\nPretty simple.\n\n580\n00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.830\nAnd then we can see my different, here's\nmy access control policy, my IPS policy,\n\n581\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.370\nmy file policy, network discovery policy,\nand if I was doing encryption,\n\n582\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.480\nwhich I can't even do on this box, but I\ncan with this code, if I had an appliance,\n\n583\n00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.030\nyou know, then I would use this.\n\n584\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.750\nAnd we'll come down here with the users,\n\n585\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.375\nwhich is basically saying How do\nI contact users and get Fires?\n\n586\n00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:06.745\nThis allows me to contact LDAP and AD\nServer, and get information and FireSIGHT.\n\n587\n00:28:06.745 --> 00:28:09.025\nSo when I see the time that it occurs,\nit will say,\n\n588\n00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:12.755\nhey Bob in sales, you need to go out\nthere because he has sort of a gripe, so\n\n589\n00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:14.545\nthis is basically where\nthat is configured.\n\n590\n00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:18.405\nCorrelation, we're going to do last, it's\na little bit convoluted in understanding\n\n591\n00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:22.845\nit, but it helps remediate issues,\nand be very proactive.\n\n592\n00:28:22.845 --> 00:28:25.030\nBut it's a lot of detail,\nso I'll cover that last.\n\n593\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:25.680\ntest.\nAll right, so\n\n594\n00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.080\nnonetheless, we're going to hang out over\nhere and this is what we're going to do.\n\n595\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.580\nWe're going to start with filed policies,\nI'll show you.\n\n596\n00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.010\nLet's create this and\nthen we'll create an intrusion policy.\n\n597\n00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.530\nNow I could just create an access\ncontrol policy and leave it, but\n\n598\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.425\nagain the whole idea here is for\nme to show you what has worked for me For\n\n599\n00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:41.965\nme over the last couple of years,\nwhen I teach classes,\n\n600\n00:28:41.965 --> 00:28:44.255\nwhen I go to my customers,\nthis is kind of how I do it.\n\n601\n00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.825\nAnd then you'll kind of\nlearn to do it your way.\n\n602\n00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.775\nBut let me just show you what's worked for\nme,\n\n603\n00:28:48.775 --> 00:28:50.565\nwhat's the minimum to get you guys going.\n\n604\n00:28:50.565 --> 00:28:54.088\nNow that being said,\nthis is what we'll do on a day to day.\n\n605\n00:28:54.088 --> 00:28:57.369\nWe've got our overview for, and\nthis is kind of where we hang out,\n\n606\n00:28:57.369 --> 00:29:00.550\nthis is the screen I look at and\nsay well, how screwed am I today?\n\n607\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.317\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n608\n00:29:01.317 --> 00:29:04.723\nyou know I get up in the morning and\nget my coffee, I'll log into my customers,\n\n609\n00:29:04.723 --> 00:29:07.849\npeople pay me to actually go out and look\ninto their networks, so I'll log in and\n\n610\n00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:09.320\nsay how screwed is my day going to be?\n\n611\n00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.150\nAnd this basically tells me.\n\n612\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.430\nSo, now let's come over here, and\n\n613\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.462\nthis is what I was talking\nabout in the last screen.\n\n614\n00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:16.840\nI've got what's called a health policy and\na system policy.\n\n615\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.940\nNow, health policy in itself\ndoesn't change anything,\n\n616\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.590\nwhat it does does is alert you\nto issues that are going on.\n\n617\n00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.630\nWe'll go through this,\nthere's a lot of detail in here, so\n\n618\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.400\nwe'll skip over some of the stuff\nthat's not real important in HIT,\n\n619\n00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.110\nonly the stuff that I find that's really\nimportant to my customers is important to\n\n620\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.730\nyou, there is some stuff in here.\n\n621\n00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.920\nNow what's important in here,\n[INAUDIBLE] is the system though.\n\n622\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.880\nWe'll spend a little bit more time here,\nbut\n\n623\n00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.510\nthese are the things you set up once\nwhen you get your defense center.\n\n624\n00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.050\nI don't even have,\n\n625\n00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.240\non the boxes that we use here,\nI don't have any managed devices in there.\n\n626\n00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.930\nIn other words, we're gonna go out and\nbuild these managed devices and\n\n627\n00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.370\nthen we're going to put them in my\ndefense, in our management center.\n\n628\n00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.040\nBefore I do that, I'm going to create\na Health Policy and a System Policy.\n\n629\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.140\nAnd then, I'm gonna just use those for\nevery managed device that I have.\n\n630\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.920\nCan I create ones for\ndifferent managed devices?\n\n631\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:01.675\nSure, but really these are, think of\nthese as, over here is big picture stuff,\n\n632\n00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:02.900\neveryday.\n\n633\n00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.280\nFor example, email relay or\ntime synchronization.\n\n634\n00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.695\nHere's one of the things you guys need\nto remember as you're setting this\n\n635\n00:30:10.695 --> 00:30:12.030\nup: you need an NTP server.\n\n636\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.140\nThese things are very sensitive to time.\n\n637\n00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.660\nYou'll get these health warnings.\n\n638\n00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.720\nWoah, I'm freaking out!\n\n639\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.500\nBecause I'm off by one\nthousandths of a millisecond.\n\n640\n00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.610\nStuff like that.\n\n641\n00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.575\nWe'll also use the monitoring\ntools over here.\n\n642\n00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:26.985\nSo we've got monitoring some tools and\nwill show scheduling.\n\n643\n00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:28.600\nWe'll talk about backup and restore.\n\n644\n00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.540\nThis is real important to understand,\nbecause if you do this wrong and\n\n645\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.360\nyou try to restore it,\nit will bring your device down.\n\n646\n00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.375\nMonitoring we'll go through that,\nand how do we license this.\n\n647\n00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:41.580\nWe'll talk about this in a minute as well.\n\n648\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.140\nThis is not that easy,\n\n649\n00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.320\nit is not necessarily hard but it is not\nas easy as CISCO devices used to be.\n\n650\n00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.826\nIn other words, [LAUGH] and here's\nthe thing that you guys need to remember.\n\n651\n00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:56.130\nCisco decided, hm,\nI can sell you a license for this box, but\n\n652\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.600\nI think it would be better if\nyou pay me every year for this.\n\n653\n00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.250\nDon't you think?\n\n654\n00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.802\n>> Nice little subscription,\nit's a revenue generating model.\n\n655\n00:31:01.802 --> 00:31:04.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> I like this idea, guys.\n\n656\n00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.248\nEverytime you watch this video you can\nwatch it for a year then you have to pay\n\n657\n00:31:08.248 --> 00:31:11.235\nme again, maybe that's how you guys work,\nI don't know.\n\n658\n00:31:11.235 --> 00:31:11.836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n659\n00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:14.970\nthey're using the IT ProTV's method now.\n\n660\n00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.240\nCisco's decided, hey, Microsoft,\ngot the Office 365, and by the way,\n\n661\n00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.340\nif you guys notice this.\n\n662\n00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.890\nMy wife the other day was like,\nI need to buy this Adobe thing.\n\n663\n00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.410\nI remember last time when we bought\nit five years ago it was 6 grand for\n\n664\n00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.170\nthis suite and all this other stuff.\n\n665\n00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.590\nAnd now she said it was 59 bucks and\nI was like.\n\n666\n00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.690\nAnd she says well, it's all virtual and\nit kind of makes sense now.\n\n667\n00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.100\nWhen everyone has to pay for it,\nwe can see how the prices come down.\n\n668\n00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.460\nNow, some of that writes books.\n\n669\n00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.220\nI used to make music in the 80s, but\nI would never download music or books or\n\n670\n00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.230\nanything like that, but as you can see,\n\n671\n00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.820\nthe prices on Microsoft came way down and\nAdobe was a really big one too because.\n\n672\n00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.700\n>> Huge.\n>> that's very important.\n\n673\n00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.620\nBut we're seeing that maybe this\ncwill happen with Cisco as well.\n\n674\n00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.720\nBut they're certainly getting into that\nmodel and this is no different here.\n\n675\n00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.790\nThe updates are very important.\n\n676\n00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:04.460\nYou're going to want to do your updates\nevery day, and then when do you\n\n677\n00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:09.279\nimplement them, you gotta remember that if\nI go out and put an access control policy,\n\n678\n00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:13.600\nI'm gonna slow down my talking here,\non a managed device, it could stop data.\n\n679\n00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.998\nIt could stop inspection.\n\n680\n00:32:14.998 --> 00:32:17.270\nSo we're gonna look at\nsomething that says, well,\n\n681\n00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.950\nwhen I'm updating these policies,\ndo I let data through?\n\n682\n00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.220\nOr do I stop it until I can inspect it?\n\n683\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.050\nSo in other words, so I just say, well,\nI'm just going to let it go for right now,\n\n684\n00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.160\nor no,\nI'm going to stop it until this is done.\n\n685\n00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.113\nWell, I've had some customers that were\n\n686\n00:32:32.113 --> 00:32:35.499\nthat had some 5585's with\na base firepower module.\n\n687\n00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:39.951\nAnd what would happen is,\ntheir access control policies were large,\n\n688\n00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:45.233\nthey had multiple customers and they\ncouldn't send data that wasn't inspected,\n\n689\n00:32:45.233 --> 00:32:49.241\nand they would stop data for\nabout eight minutes or something.\n\n690\n00:32:49.241 --> 00:32:53.120\nSo their network go down for\nabout eight minutes.\n\n691\n00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.440\nAnd they were just like,\nI can't do this anymore, and\n\n692\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.640\nthey pulled out the ASAs and\nput in the appliances.\n\n693\n00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.500\nWhich then took less than a minute or\nwhatever their solution was.\n\n694\n00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.560\nMy point is the ASA is\na phenomenal solution.\n\n695\n00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.620\nI'm not saying there's\nanything wrong with it, but\n\n696\n00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.620\ndepending on your network is\nthe model that you choose.\n\n697\n00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.870\nWe're using the 5506's here, and\n\n698\n00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.550\nit would be pretty hilarious to\nput this out on enterprise, right?\n\n699\n00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.970\nBecause your internet would be more down\nthan up in this case, but for home use.\n\n700\n00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.910\nSo again, why is this important?\n\n701\n00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.740\nYou're gonna see this on every\nproduct that Cisco makes eventually.\n\n702\n00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.840\nWhen, I don't know, but.\n\n703\n00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.850\nOkay so, one of the things\nthat we'll spend over here.\n\n704\n00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.009\nAgain, we got our health, we got our\nsystem, there's the local configuration,\n\n705\n00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.990\nand something called system policy.\n\n706\n00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.740\nAnd that's again, where we make broad\nconfigurations for our devices.\n\n707\n00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.150\nSo we'll come over here and\nyou'll see this is the first thing I do.\n\n708\n00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.196\nSo I'm going to start my upgrades.\n\n709\n00:33:42.196 --> 00:33:43.880\nAnd then we're gonna come over here and\nsay,\n\n710\n00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.630\nlet configure our Firesight management\ncenter for broad configurations.\n\n711\n00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:53.350\nAnd then once we do that, we'll come back\nover here and start creating our policies.\n\n712\n00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.690\nOnce our devices are done,\nI can create all my policies.\n\n713\n00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.320\nI can do everything that I want.\n\n714\n00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.510\nThen, I can add my devices in here and\nthen push them out and\n\n715\n00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.740\nthat's pretty much what we're\ngoing to get done today.\n\n716\n00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.560\nAlright.\nSo, let's go back to where we were here.\n\n717\n00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.470\nNo, that's not it.\n\n718\n00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.490\nPowerpoint.\nPowerpoint.\n\n719\n00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:12.350\n>> We had one last policy to talk about,\nit was the network analysis policy.\n\n720\n00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.610\n>> Thank you, that is right.\n\n721\n00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.580\nNow, this is something newish.\n\n722\n00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.940\nSo when Cisco came out with 5.4 code,\nand they're just hitting 6.0 code.\n\n723\n00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.150\nSo we're still running 5.4,\nit's a phenomenal code, and\n\n724\n00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.300\nI'm not saying run out and\nupgrade, but the fact is,\n\n725\n00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.680\nis they came out with something\ncalled a network analysis policy.\n\n726\n00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.060\nIt kind of just made things\nmore convoluted and harder, and\n\n727\n00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.830\nthis is my personal opinion that I\nwas able to do everything they do\n\n728\n00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.700\nin this policy within\nmy IPS policy before.\n\n729\n00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.520\nAnd it made everything flow,\nit made sense.\n\n730\n00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.250\nSo what they did is, there's something\ncalled snort proof processors.\n\n731\n00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.890\nAnd what this does is understand,\n\n732\n00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.670\nhey I've got this file coming\nin where did it come from?\n\n733\n00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.185\nDid it come from a Window server,\nor did it come from an Apache.\n\n734\n00:34:55.185 --> 00:34:58.650\nHow do I read this from right to left,\nleft to right.\n\n735\n00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.860\nHow do I read this data?\n\n736\n00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.430\nAnd then also it does something\ncalled normalization.\n\n737\n00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.540\nWhich means that if someone is\ngoing to do an attack then the'll\n\n738\n00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.700\nscrew with the headers, an IP or\nTCP or something like that.\n\n739\n00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.730\nAnd so what this does is go and\n\n740\n00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.880\nnormalizes the headers to normalize,\npossibly, an attack.\n\n741\n00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.760\nAnd so then we can understand it and read\nit, it puts it back to the RFC standards.\n\n742\n00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.393\nSo the pre-processes\nare extremely important, and\n\n743\n00:35:23.393 --> 00:35:25.520\nwe'll go through those towards the end.\n\n744\n00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.580\nWhat they did is they pulled this out, and\nthey just put it in a separate policy.\n\n745\n00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.460\nAnd that was their decision, and\nthat's what we have to deal with.\n\n746\n00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.360\nAnd so we will definitely go over that,\nand one of the reasons that they did this,\n\n747\n00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.940\nthe one thing that I found is,\nit comes back to my file policy.\n\n748\n00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.470\nRemember when I talked to you about,\nhey, a file comes in we're reading what\n\n749\n00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:48.090\ntype of file it is, well that could\ntake multi hundreds of milliseconds, or\n\n750\n00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:52.970\nwhatever we decide we have to read 1,480\nbytes of data to determine the file type.\n\n751\n00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.490\nSo, during that time what\ndo we do with the file?\n\n752\n00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.110\nWell we're transferring the file.\n\n753\n00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.730\nAnd this network analysis\npolicy now can apply.\n\n754\n00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:05.350\nThis is part of,\nthey also added in the advanced\n\n755\n00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:10.260\nconfiguration in here for the device,\nthat we can also now do an IPS\n\n756\n00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.950\npolicy while we're determining the file\ntype, so we're gonna come back to that.\n\n757\n00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:20.020\nBut part of this network analysis\npolicy is in that same advance screen.\n\n758\n00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.590\n>> Now Todd, I know the policy is really\na pivotal piece, kind of a critical thing.\n\n759\n00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.140\nWe do have some more to talk about but\n\n760\n00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.770\nwe've kind of run out of\ntime on this episode.\n\n761\n00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:33.370\nDo we want to do a second part and\ncover some of the other basics, or?\n\n762\n00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.450\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay, I know\n\n763\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.500\nwe want to get to the hands-on,\nwe want to get to the nitty gritty,\n\n764\n00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.170\ngetting it installed, but\nit's super important that we understand\n\n765\n00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.640\nall the foundational knowledge\nbefore we move to that.\n\n766\n00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.190\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\ndo a part two.\n\n767\n00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.650\nWe'll cover some of the other basic stuff.\n\n768\n00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.490\nWe've covered a lot of\nreally good things and\n\n769\n00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.805\nthe policies, you can't understate how,\nwell I guess you could understate it.\n\n770\n00:36:51.805 --> 00:36:52.795\nYou can't overstate, there we go,\n\n771\n00:36:52.795 --> 00:36:55.965\nhow important those policies\nare to making this all work.\n\n772\n00:36:55.965 --> 00:36:57.915\nAnd it's really the heart of the system.\n\n773\n00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.325\nSo we're definitely gonna see those again.\n\n774\n00:36:59.325 --> 00:37:02.115\nBut for this episode this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap it up.\n\n775\n00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:03.265\nSo, we'll take a break here.\n\n776\n00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:05.415\nDefinitely stay tuned.\n\n777\n00:37:05.415 --> 00:37:06.745\nWe're gonna come back with part two.\n\n778\n00:37:06.745 --> 00:37:09.548\nCover some more of the basics, get\na chance to see the rest of that before\n\n779\n00:37:09.548 --> 00:37:11.607\nwe start jumping into actually\ndoing the install and\n\n780\n00:37:11.607 --> 00:37:13.648\ngetting this infrastructure back up and\nrunning.\n\n781\n00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.817\nSo, thank you guys for watching.\n\n782\n00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:21.513\nSigning for ITProTV, I'm Don Pozet with\nTodd Landley and we'll see you next time.\n\n783\n00:37:21.513 -->

and\n\n4\n00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.771\ngood evening, and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.190\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.040\nBack again with another\nepisode of Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n7\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.060\nAnd in our first episode we got a chance\nto kind of see what FirePOWER was and\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670\nthe basic overview of it.\n\n9\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.320\nAnd in this episode we're ready to\njump right back into the trenches,\n\n10\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.640\nget a chance to see a little bit more\nabout what it is and how it functions.\n\n11\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.430\nAnd start to see how we can get\nthat deployed on our network.\n\n12\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.490\nAnd back again, I've got in the studio\nhere Mr. Todd Lammle to help us.\n\n13\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.330\nAnd Todd, let's start to pull\nsome of these pieces together.\n\n14\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.235\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n15\n00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:46.731\nNow we know what it is.\n\n16\n00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:48.195\nHow do we implement this?\n\n17\n00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.956\n>> That's a great question,\nand this is the next piece.\n\n18\n00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.630\nSo, hopefully, I didn't go too fast or\ngo over any heads.\n\n19\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.540\nAnd we can replay that video,\nright, in that last section.\n\n20\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.040\nI know it's a mouthful.\n\n21\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.720\nIt's a lot of information, but we have\nto build this foundation, my friends.\n\n22\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.030\nWe have to have enough fundamental\nunderstanding, before I start\n\n23\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.260\ngetting deeper into these policies and\nunderstand, why are we doing this?\n\n24\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.400\nRight?\nSo, why are we here?\n\n25\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.150\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here and\n\n26\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.960\nunderstand where this sits in a network.\n\n27\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.892\nSo, at this point, here,\nthese are icons for an ASA.\n\n28\n00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.471\nRemember these are manage devices.\n\n29\n00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:24.465\nThey can actually be the appliance to,\nagain it depends on your throughput.\n\n30\n00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:25.824\nWhere it's at in your network.\n\n31\n00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:28.100\nThose are hard decisions, right?\n\n32\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.810\nIt's not something that\nI can ever give anyone.\n\n33\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.300\nUnless you're paying me to\ncome out there and tell you,\n\n34\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.180\nthen I will give you that decision.\n\n35\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.730\n[LAUGH] None the less let's take\na look at some of the devices we have.\n\n36\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.680\nWe have our managed devices.\n\n37\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.980\nWe have our ASAs in this example.\n\n38\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.998\nAnd notice we cluster them for\nhigh availability.\n\n39\n00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:47.190\nNow I'm gonna stop here and\ngive you guys a point of contention.\n\n40\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.530\nRemember I sit there and\nsay, I don't work for Cisco.\n\n41\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.929\nThey don't even necessarily like me.\n\n42\n00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.877\nBut [LAUGH] the fact is,\nis I work on their products all the time.\n\n43\n00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:58.070\nI'm out at customers and\nI see the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n44\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.440\nAnd obviously there's more good\nthan the bad and the ugly.\n\n45\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.399\nAnd that's why I've still been\nworking on it for 30 years.\n\n46\n00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.473\nBut the fact is in this case here,\nand let's talk about this for\n\n47\n00:02:06.473 --> 00:02:10.359\none second because when we've got this\nhigh availability here you're going to\n\n48\n00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.240\nhave that lift.\n\n49\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.621\nYou have two ASAs and\nyou can have up to 16.\n\n50\n00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.159\nRight, and you have eight ASA as\nan active, and eight stand by, and again,\n\n51\n00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.168\nit just depends on how many zeros\nyou can put at the end of your PO.\n\n52\n00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:23.917\nSo, the fact is, how much throughput can\nwe get, we can get a lot with that, right?\n\n53\n00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.914\nBut the fact here is here\nis if I had two ASAs and\n\n54\n00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:29.283\nI was running the enterprise license I\ncan get a high availability license,\n\n55\n00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:32.620\nsaying hey, this other guy's on standby,\nso I'm gonna pay half as much.\n\n56\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.850\nOr it's a lot less money\nthan a regular license.\n\n57\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.020\nWe do not have that flexibility\nwith the FirePOWER right now.\n\n58\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.000\nAnd this is a point of contention that I\ncome across with a lot of my customers.\n\n59\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.020\nAgain, I'm gonna try to explain to you\neverything I see in the field everyday,\n\n60\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.120\nand all the complaints I get, and\nall the great stuff again theirs I got to,\n\n61\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.265\nI know I'm gonna tell you\na lot of the bad stuff, but\n\n62\n00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:53.430\nthere's always more good\nthan bad with this product.\n\n63\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.770\nAnd this is no exception here,\nexcept the licenses are not permanent.\n\n64\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.410\nRight?\n\n65\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.190\nSo their are some permanent\nlicenses certainly with the ASA,\n\n66\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.390\nsome permanent with the FirePOWER, but\nnot all of them are like the Amp for\n\n67\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.338\nexample and the URL filtering.\n\n68\n00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:10.056\nAnd so on, these are term licensing we\nare gonna pay in one and three year terms.\n\n69\n00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.210\nAnd as we mentioned in the first module,\nthe Microsoft, 365, and so on, so\n\n70\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.850\nwe are gonna pay for those.\n\n71\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.000\nNow the problem with this is high\navailability here is at this,\n\n72\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.270\nat the time of this filming, their is\nstill no solution for higher availability\n\n73\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.175\nlicense on what your paying licenses for\nboth and your paying the full cost, and\n\n74\n00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.515\nthat's something we're bearing right now,\nbut I'm sure, that's in the works.\n\n75\n00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:32.855\nI've heard about it many times.\n\n76\n00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:35.365\nI just haven't seen a solution yet,\nso again, I'm gonna come up, and\n\n77\n00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:38.875\nI'm gonna tell you some of the ugly,\nand that's part of it.\n\n78\n00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:42.015\nNow, we're going to do this, and\nwe're gonna have high availability.\n\n79\n00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:44.275\nWe're gonna pay the cost right now,\nbecause it's worth it.\n\n80\n00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:46.825\nAgain, the good supersedes\nthe cost in this case.\n\n81\n00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.010\nNow, with that being said,\nI need a couple devices here.\n\n82\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.970\nNow, I need either a virtual\nFireSIGHT management center or\n\n83\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.760\na virtual defense center, and I need\nsome sort of management PC of some sort.\n\n84\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.570\nAnd these plug in to the management port,\nlike the M00, M01 port, of your ASA,\n\n85\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.450\ndepending on what module you have.\n\n86\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.620\nModel, I'm sorry, that you have.\n\n87\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.140\nAnd, and in this case here, so I, I 'm\ngoing to see something called ASTM and\n\n88\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.840\nif you haven't heard of that I think\nI have that here running yeah, and\n\n89\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.780\nthis here is how I managed now I typically\ndon't manage my ASAs this way I just know.\n\n90\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.810\nI say that,\nbecause a lot of people I know use ASTM.\n\n91\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.238\nIt's a GUI that manages the ASA.\n\n92\n00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:30.780\nNow I 'm a command line guy, I do hundreds\nof ASAs and I still use the command line.\n\n93\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.750\nBut in this case here, and in my classes,\nand since I'm doing this video,\n\n94\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.022\nI'm going to share hey, ASA is, and\nwe can see here their's a FirePOWER,\n\n95\n00:04:37.022 --> 00:04:41.570\nFirePower tab cuz this guy has\na FirePower module on it right, so,\n\n96\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.040\nin this case it's not even working because\nI haven't built it yet but, none the less.\n\n97\n00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.460\nWe have ASDM that helps us monitor and\nmanage our ASA's.\n\n98\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.870\nIt's not necessary but\nmost people would use it.\n\n99\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.500\nI'm just an old school guy Don.\n\n100\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.660\nWhat can I say?\n\n101\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.650\n>> Now, you know from the work station\nside if you're using the ASDM, if you're\n\n102\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.980\nusing the CLA, you're really just having\nthat management interface for you.\n\n103\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.900\nI know you mentioned the FireSIGHT\nmanagement center as a virtual appliance.\n\n104\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.350\nIs that, that's a VM that we download\n\n105\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.040\nfrom Cisco-\n>> Yep.\n\n106\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.750\n>> Or we build that?\n\n107\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.410\n>> No, no.\nIt is.\n\n108\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.218\nIt's still VA you get when you buy\nthe products, so you're going to buy,\n\n109\n00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:14.764\nthis is a separate line item.\n\n110\n00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:15.925\nAnd it's not very expensive,\nthe virtual one.\n\n111\n00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:16.551\nFew hundred bucks.\n\n112\n00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:17.864\n$400, I don't remember.\n\n113\n00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:20.208\nBut you can get them in two user versions.\n\n114\n00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:23.865\nThat's the ones I use in my pods for\ndemos and classes and so on.\n\n115\n00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.710\nUp to 25 users.\n\n116\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.529\nNow, if you have 25 managed devices.\n\n117\n00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.981\nNow I got to be straight with you,\nif you have 25 managed devices,\n\n118\n00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:35.930\nI wouldn't use a virtual appliance.\n\n119\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.060\nAgain, all this datas\ngot to go through their,\n\n120\n00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.610\nit's got to correlated it 's got to you\nknow, we have correlation of events.\n\n121\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.030\nIt's a lot of throughput, my friends.\n\n122\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.020\nAnd doing this on a manual, I'm sorry,\na virtual FMC as a defense center.\n\n123\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.600\nYou probably won't be able\nto do something like that.\n\n124\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.040\nso, a lot of time the benchmark is\nwhatever they say, like if it's 25,\n\n125\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.510\nthen you know you can do 12 and you can\nget throughput, something like that.\n\n126\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.410\nYou think about it.\n\n127\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.000\nSo, even in this case here\nwhere I have the two,\n\n128\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.930\nthe two version, it works great for\nclass we're not pushing real data,\n\n129\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.220\nI'm pushing some data through it,\nnot real data through it.\n\n130\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.840\nI think i might have a hard time in\nproduction with it but, this we need here,\n\n131\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.310\nlets go back to web duality here.\n\n132\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.930\nI need an FMC, I need a defense center,\nright, that is where we correlate all our\n\n133\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.970\nvents right, that's how we do our policies\nand puts them out to our managed devices.\n\n134\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.440\nI need some sort of management PC in here,\nso\n\n135\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.430\nI can get in to the FireSIGHT management\ncenter because we use 443 radiation PC\n\n136\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.800\nto manage this we can use SSH.\n\n137\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.611\nIn that case, though,\nthe shell doesn't give us the commands and\n\n138\n00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:35.118\neverything that we need.\n\n139\n00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:36.580\nThere's some stuff that we can do with it,\nbut\n\n140\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.841\nI pretty much shy away from the command\nline when it comes to FireSIGHT.\n\n141\n00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:40.594\nThere's not as much that we can do.\n\n142\n00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:43.812\nThe and are extremely powerful, and\n\n143\n00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:48.030\nthe tools in there are extremely\nhelpful once you understand it.\n\n144\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.490\nYou can maneuver around it.\n\n145\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.430\nIt's a little convoluted at first,\nI will give you that.\n\n146\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.532\nAnd it does take some time to get used to.\n\n147\n00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:56.249\nBut once you get used to it, then\nyou're like, I can't live without this.\n\n148\n00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.873\nEveryday I get up and\nthat's what I do, right?\n\n149\n00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:03.250\nSo anyways, so I have have this, and I\nhave these in my, this is important, guys.\n\n150\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.674\nA lot of people put this in their\nof their inside network, right?\n\n151\n00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:07.754\nAnd you can't do it.\n\n152\n00:07:07.754 --> 00:07:10.685\nYou can't get to the management\nof that way, for these ASAs and\n\n153\n00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:11.968\nto this FireSIGHT module.\n\n154\n00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:13.455\nWe have to go through\nthe management point.\n\n155\n00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:17.705\nNow, with that being said,\nall of my customers, and\n\n156\n00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:19.985\nI always have everyone do\na layer two connectivity.\n\n157\n00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:21.695\nIn other words, we're on the same VLAN.\n\n158\n00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:22.530\nWe're in the same network.\n\n159\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.370\nWe're connected basically directly,\ncan we do it as a layer three?\n\n160\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.240\nYou can, it's not suggested by Cisco,\nthat's not their preferred design.\n\n161\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.130\nBut let's say that you had multiple\ndefense centers all over Europe, and\n\n162\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.300\nI have a customer that has that,\nthat's why I mentioned this,\n\n163\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.660\nthen you're going to have to route to\nthat port, and it is a route port.\n\n164\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.092\nIt's just not the preferred solution\nin this case, but it can be done.\n\n165\n00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:47.812\nOkay, that being said, let's take a look\nhere at this screen again, so inside here,\n\n166\n00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:51.626\nI have my FireSIGHT management center,\nand I get my HTTPS 443, and\n\n167\n00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:55.595\nthis is where I do my configurations and\nnotice these policies, right?\n\n168\n00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:57.719\nI configure, how am I configuring this?\n\n169\n00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:59.090\nThrough policies, all right.\n\n170\n00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.363\nAnd, from there though, I can get events,\n\n171\n00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:04.313\nand correlation of events,\nan understanding of what's\n\n172\n00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:08.010\ngoing on in my network by looking at\nsomething called file trajectory.\n\n173\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.330\nSo, once I create a file policy,\n\n174\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.450\nnow we can see how these files\ntraverse through my network.\n\n175\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.400\nIf they have malware.\n\n176\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.990\nI can tell, hey,\nit came in on Bob in sales.\n\n177\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.260\nIt went through Sally, though marketing,\nand it actually shows me the files that\n\n178\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.170\ntraversed my network\nbased on FireSIGHT data.\n\n179\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.750\nVery cool technology.\n\n180\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.200\nAMP events and correlation between events,\n\n181\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.110\nand what makes this product more\npowerful than Palo Alto, for example?\n\n182\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.050\nMcAfee?\nAnd I'm not here to put any product down.\n\n183\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.041\nBut I am gonna tell you\nthat this is more powerful,\n\n184\n00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:35.745\nin the sense that, we can have\na single point of management and\n\n185\n00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:41.050\nwe can correlate events between different\npolicies and different types of events.\n\n186\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.630\nVery cool technology that no\none else has at this point.\n\n187\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.928\nEveryone is gonna to be playing\ncatch up for Cisco for awhile.\n\n188\n00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:51.890\nThey spent $3.2 billion for a reason, and\nthey really do have leverage in this area.\n\n189\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.230\nAnd, now, that being said, my manage\ndevices can talk to what used to be called\n\n190\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.210\nthe vulnerability research team, and\n\n191\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.120\na lot of times when you pull down reports\nfrom there you still see it as VRT.\n\n192\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.320\nBut the new name for it as Cisco, named\nit after they bought it is, called Talos.\n\n193\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.044\nAnd basically, this is a dynamic analysis\ncloud of a sandbox in the sky for\n\n194\n00:09:08.044 --> 00:09:10.400\nyou to go ahead and\nsend files to for analysis.\n\n195\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.863\nThey send back a threat score, and\n\n196\n00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:14.190\nwe'll take a look at some of\nthe reports they send you.\n\n197\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.290\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n198\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.580\nI've met some of these people.\n\n199\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.170\nThey are unbelievably smart, my friends.\n\n200\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.360\nThese guys are brilliant, Don.\n\n201\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.190\nThey make me feel dumb\njust being around them.\n\n202\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.880\nRight?\n\n203\n00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.510\n>> Yeah.\nWhen that's all you do for\n\n204\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.340\na living,\nthese are dedicated professionals.\n\n205\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.970\nSome of the best in the field.\n\n206\n00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.126\nThey'll make everyone feel dumb.\nYeah, they are unbelievable,\n\n207\n00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:35.670\nI can't even get my mind around it.but,\nthey're really great.\n\n208\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.543\nAnd we also have something else\nout there called the M Cloud and\n\n209\n00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:44.236\nbasically are notice our defense center\nand sends stuff up to the M Cloud for\n\n210\n00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:49.078\nanalysis, and get a threat score based on,\nand we don't send the file guys,\n\n211\n00:09:49.078 --> 00:09:52.540\nwe send what,\nI wish I could Get some response on here.\n\n212\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.169\nIt's like, what do you think we\nsend right, we can't send the file,\n\n213\n00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:58.150\nhow do we send, like all a large file.\n\n214\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.060\nThe answer is, we send the hash right,\nthe Shaw two video six.\n\n215\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.056\nWe actually just send the hash out\nthere ,and that's analyzing and\n\n216\n00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:06.310\nwe get a threat score back from their.\n\n217\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.350\nNow notice, there is one more\npiece on here that is important.\n\n218\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.180\nAnd this is our endpoint connectors.\n\n219\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.190\nOur actual device is on the end.\n\n220\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.600\nWe can run a supplicant.\n\n221\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.074\n[LAUGH] Again, this is more money,\nso,another zero on that P.O.\n\n222\n00:10:19.074 --> 00:10:19.890\ntype of thing.\n\n223\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.445\nAnd we can manage these devices.\n\n224\n00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:25.793\nAnd then they can talk to the M cloud,\nget a file disposition.\n\n225\n00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:29.325\nOnce that 's filed disposition,\nthat disposition, that Shaw comes back,\n\n226\n00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:31.315\nwe actually tell the fire\nsite management center, and\n\n227\n00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:34.555\nit keeps that disposition in there for\none to four hours.\n\n228\n00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:38.117\nDepending on what it comes back as then\nas, and then as that file comes through,\n\n229\n00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:41.105\nwe're like oh, we already have\na disposition, I don't need it.\n\n230\n00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:44.657\nI can now send it to the egress or\ndrop it based on its threat score and\n\n231\n00:10:44.657 --> 00:10:45.940\nwhat we set up.\n\n232\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.510\nAll right, so\nbasically it looks like this.\n\n233\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.970\nWhere I have my endpoint connectors here,\nand these are running the source fire\n\n234\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.600\nendpoint connectors directly,\nand this is in addition to.\n\n235\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.270\nI've had some customers going well I don't\nhave to buy my McAfee virus checker or\n\n236\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.510\nanything anymore, and I'm like,\nno I don't know if that's a good idea.\n\n237\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.170\nAnd I'm not gonna sit here and\ntell you what to do, that's not my job,\n\n238\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.055\nbut the fact is,\nthis is to look for malware.\n\n239\n00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:12.090\nAgain, our biggest threats,\nthey are malware, the ransomware, and\n\n240\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.050\nall that stuff comes within that.\n\n241\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.439\nSo I always say, let's leave our virus\nchecker, and trojan checkers, the basic\n\n242\n00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:23.460\nMcAfee, Norton, whatever you guys wanna\nuse, and then this is a supplement on top.\n\n243\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.490\nRight?\n>> Yeah, and those antivirus products,\n\n244\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.950\na lot of people call them HIPS, host-based\nintrusion prevention systems, and\n\n245\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.190\nwe kinda still need those, because\nwhile this does great for filtering\n\n246\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.730\ntraffic that passes through it, what about\nthe traffic that doesn't pass through it?\n\n247\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.900\nAll right?\nSomebody brings an infected laptop in\n\n248\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.530\nfrom home.\n\n249\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.820\nDoes it protect from that scenario,\nif they're behind your firewall already,\n\n250\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.020\ndo we skip past that or does it have\ntechnology for catching that, too?\n\n251\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.540\n>> It does, and\nthat's part of Firesight, right?\n\n252\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.940\nSo, we're gonna to see data as it comes in\nwhat we'll call the ingress if it's coming\n\n253\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.065\nthe inside in this case here and we can\ninspect the inside interface as well.\n\n254\n00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:02.785\nWe don't necessarily always do that,\nbut we can, and\n\n255\n00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:05.855\nwe can determine if malware is\nrunning on the inside network.\n\n256\n00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:08.145\nThat's part of the power of this product,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:11.255\nWe're always looking at the network,\nthe Fire sites, always making sure and\n\n258\n00:12:11.255 --> 00:12:12.640\nlet you know what's going on.\n\n259\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.080\nSo in this case here, we have our security\nintelligence cloud, and notice we have\n\n260\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.550\nthis, what's called endpoint management,\nand this manages all these devices.\n\n261\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.920\nActually, I'm not logged into it now,\nbut I can log into one.\n\n262\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.521\nSo I have this ISP that I look at,\nand you're thinking well,\n\n263\n00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.670\nI get a lot of customers\nthat tell me I go out there.\n\n264\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.291\nAnd I'm like well, let me show you\nthe malware on you have on your network,\n\n265\n00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:35.200\nit's like we don't have any malware.\n\n266\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.063\nI'm like.\nSure you don't.\n\n267\n00:12:36.063 --> 00:12:37.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll go ahead and connect it.\n\n268\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.789\nI'll take an out there with this on there,\njust let it run, go to lunch and\n\n269\n00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:44.170\ncome back and show them all the malware.\n\n270\n00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.840\nAnd if I was a salesman I\nwould be walking out with a PO\n\n271\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.830\nbecause they'd be like oh, my god.\n\n272\n00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.510\nI can't believe all this is happening.\n\n273\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.670\nRight?\nSo this can actually find it.\n\n274\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.980\nSo I wanna get right in the configuration,\nguys.\n\n275\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.760\nI know we kinda done a lot of lecture,\nand I don't like doing that.\n\n276\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.560\nWe don't like Powerpoints.\n\n277\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.100\nWe Death by Powerpoint, I would think\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.071\n>> We don't want that, but\n\n279\n00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:04.900\nthere was some fundamental understandings\nthat we have to understand.\n\n280\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.620\nWe have a defense center.\n\n281\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.000\nWe have a managed device that\nthe defense center configures.\n\n282\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.800\nWe have the clouds that we talk to.\n\n283\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.280\nThe Tauros and the Amp cloud.\n\n284\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.180\nAnd we're constantly getting updated\non the storm rules and everything.\n\n285\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.712\nNow the FireSIGHT Management Center again,\nthis gives us real-time processing and\n\n286\n00:13:20.712 --> 00:13:21.750\ncorrelation of events.\n\n287\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.870\nAnd this is kinda where, really,\nthis product sings, right?\n\n288\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.810\nSo, if I was to say, hey, I've got.\n\n289\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.627\nAnd again,\nI'm not gonna pick on Palo Alto, but\n\n290\n00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:30.630\nI'm gonna use them as an example.\n\n291\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.110\nBut again,\nI don't have anything against them.\n\n292\n00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.345\nThey have, for what Cisco does here,\nI'll go out there, and they'll have nine\n\n293\n00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:40.170\ndifferent administrative interfaces\ndo the same thing we do with here.\n\n294\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.080\nDo you see the difference, there, guys?\n\n295\n00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.209\nSo, can they do the same thing?\n\n296\n00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:46.700\nKind of.\n\n297\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.500\nThe issue is they have all these\ndifferent administrative screens,\n\n298\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.240\nand there's no correlation between events.\n\n299\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.990\nAll right?\nSo now I've got my pom-poms for\n\n300\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.640\nCisco behind me right, going, hey, Cisco\nrocks because we can do correlation of\n\n301\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.720\nevents between all these different,\npolicies and Palo Alto can't do that.\n\n302\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.530\nWe have to look at all these\nscreens separately, right?\n\n303\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.250\nSo that's a big deal for Cisco and\nI go out and do classes for\n\n304\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.430\nthem and stuff like that,\nthat's one of their big things.\n\n305\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.567\nLike hey, we're a single point of\nmanagement and it's true and this is,\n\n306\n00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:16.060\nagain, what makes this product so\npowerful, all right.\n\n307\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.720\nSo, if we look at management here,\nwe have our ASDM.\n\n308\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.180\nAnd again, you can, or\n\n309\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.620\nyou don't have to use it if you have\na single ASDM or just a couple of them.\n\n310\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.610\nI won't, I don't use it myself,\nbut most of my customers do.\n\n311\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.400\nAnd then we have our\nFireSIGHT Management Center, our FMC.\n\n312\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.080\nAnd notice this gives us everything in it.\n\n313\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.030\nWe even have SIM.\n\n314\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.470\nThis is insane.\n\n315\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.341\nIf we look at other products and\nsay all of this is inside of this or\n\n316\n00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:45.944\nall of these policies and\nall of this information we can get,\n\n317\n00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:48.710\nis now within one product, right.\n\n318\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.180\nAgain, I'm not just trying to\nsing the Cisco Kool-Aid or\n\n319\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.080\ndrink the Cisco Kool-Aid here, I'm just\nsaying this is really where we're at.\n\n320\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.130\nThis is a phenomenal screen and how we\ncan manage our networks is unprecedented\n\n321\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.730\nwith this, and this gives us.\n\n322\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.560\nAnd then, we also have the amp\nsupplicant that goes on the host.\n\n323\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.319\nSo, the host now, when a file comes in,\nthey can send it to the amp cloud and\n\n324\n00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:11.540\nget an understanding of that hash, right?\n\n325\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.380\nOkay.\n\n326\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.690\nSo let's get right into the devices, guys.\n\n327\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.726\nLet's go ahead and took a look and say,\n\n328\n00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:19.400\nI'm gonna go to\nthe FireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n329\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.400\nAnd honestly Don, I think we'll be\ndone with PowerPoints for this week.\n\n330\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.890\nDoes that make you feel good?\n\n331\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.480\n>> I love it.\n\n332\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.310\n>> I might come back to some\nPowerpoint for the file\n\n333\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.900\npolicy because we want to see how the\nfiles traverse and, and also remind me,\n\n334\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.780\nbecause I want to talk about\n>> What happens when we're configuring\n\n335\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.290\nthis in a data center?\n\n336\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.710\nOur data, typically as you guys think\nabout it, is coming through and\n\n337\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.010\nwe're analyzing it north to south.\n\n338\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.830\nThat's how we really wanna think about it.\n\n339\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.670\nBut we're in a data center,\nthings go from server to server farm and\n\n340\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.480\nthey go east to west.\n\n341\n00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.210\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n342\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.100\nAnd that creates what we call\nsome asymmetric routing issues.\n\n343\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.550\nRight, and so maybe you can\nremind me to come back to that.\n\n344\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.629\n>> Sure.\n>> And we can go through that, and\n\n345\n00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:54.530\nthat'll be some power points.\n\n346\n00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.041\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Cuz,\n\n347\n00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:59.037\nthat might be a fundamental understanding\nof how you configure this in your network\n\n348\n00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:00.417\ndepending on what you have.\n\n349\n00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:02.194\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look here.\n\n350\n00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:06.386\nSo I'm just going to use this guy here,\nthis is a just a,\n\n351\n00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:09.345\nI'm going to do view full screen here.\n\n352\n00:16:09.345 --> 00:16:11.032\nZoom, and I don't have my glasses.\n\n353\n00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:15.646\n[LAUGH] Oh, it's this guy,\nthe green guy, right?\n\n354\n00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:16.384\nThere we go.\n\n355\n00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:17.308\nDoes that look better, guys?\n\n356\n00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:17.953\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:16:17.953 --> 00:16:19.866\nNow again, we're going to take a look,\n\n358\n00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:22.830\nwe're looking at a screen\nhere that's terrible.\n\n359\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.250\nIt's awful.\nIf I was out at a customer I would run out\n\n360\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.880\nthere and disconnect their network right\nnow because they're just being attacked.\n\n361\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.370\nAnd I can come down here, and\nit's kind of hard to see and\n\n362\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:38.610\nI can understand that a little bit but\nlet me come down here and\n\n363\n00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.855\nI could say, well gosh,\nwhat's going on, right?\n\n364\n00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:46.020\nNow, I'm going to go through all of this\nhere, but I'm going to come down here and\n\n365\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.770\nsay, you know, is this all this\njust within my company, or\n\n366\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.440\nis this a real attack and everything?\n\n367\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.210\nWell in this case here, I can see\nattacks coming from Germany, Australia,\n\n368\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.610\nChina, South Korea.\n\n369\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.900\nI'm in big trouble, guys.\n\n370\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.270\nI'm in big trouble.\n\n371\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.810\nAt this point, I disconnect, I close up\nmy networks, you've got to disconnect.\n\n372\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.290\nSo again, this is a demo pod, it's just\nbeing constantly attacked hundreds of\n\n373\n00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.930\ntimes a second and we can see all this.\n\n374\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.900\nOur network would look again,\nif I can go over here and this works.\n\n375\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.860\nThis is a typical thing I see\nout of my customers, right?\n\n376\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.610\nSomething like this where\nI see a few attacks.\n\n377\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.630\nThe idea of what your job is and what I\nexplain to people when I go out to their\n\n378\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.250\ncustomers is, hey, you know your job is\nto sit here and look at the screen, and\n\n379\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.920\nto fix anything that shows up.\n\n380\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.755\nAnd I like, but I don't want to do that.\n\n381\n00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Somebody has to.\n\n382\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.020\n>> You can pay me to do it,\nbut, but someone has to do it.\n\n383\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.730\nThe fact is, if you're seeing\nsomething here, something's wrong.\n\n384\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.750\nNow, that doesn't mean it's a true attack,\nand that's what your job is.\n\n385\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.990\nI would say 50% of what I see on the\nscreen is what we'll call false positives.\n\n386\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.514\nRight, and that's gonna occur.\n\n387\n00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:48.540\nAnd why?\nBecause a Snort rule is triggered because\n\n388\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.200\nof something that was in a file header,\nand it's old and it really was an attack.\n\n389\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.150\nA lot of times I'll go out there and\nI'll see something like this, and\n\n390\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.505\nI'll clean these up by drilling into them.\n\n391\n00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:01.915\nAnd I'll find out that's something in R&D\nwas doing something with some computers,\n\n392\n00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.625\nand it triggered some Snort rule.\n\n393\n00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.125\nI can go and\n\n394\n00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.655\ndo something to that Snort rule and\nI can show you how easy it is to do.\n\n395\n00:18:06.655 --> 00:18:08.765\nI can suppress it in other\nwords till I get less event.\n\n396\n00:18:08.765 --> 00:18:11.225\nI say well, maybe it's a truth but\nI want to suppress it and say well,\n\n397\n00:18:11.225 --> 00:18:13.755\nif it's coming from R&D I\ndon't want to see it, but\n\n398\n00:18:13.755 --> 00:18:16.835\nI want to keep it for my other network.\n\n399\n00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:20.610\nI can threshold it so I can see less\nevents, or I can just disable the rule.\n\n400\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.560\nRight?\nThose are some of the things you've got to\n\n401\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.050\nthink about, that my job is to manage\nSnort rules, it really is, and\n\n402\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.640\nthis right here allows me to do that.\n\n403\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.180\nI can just do it from here.\n\n404\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.540\n>> So Todd, would,\nwould you say there's like a,\n\n405\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.540\na learning period that FirePOWER has\nto go through when you deploy it?\n\n406\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.970\n>> Yes, that, that was a really\ngood question because, and\n\n407\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.050\nthat's when I brought up like, hey,\nI come through here, and we'll go up here,\n\n408\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.140\nand I'm going to come up here to policies,\nright?\n\n409\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.390\nAnd when I click on these policies,\nI talked about hey, let's do it again.\n\n410\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.810\nI know this is kind of hard to see.\n\n411\n00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.980\nBut if we click it over here,\nand I'm going to say, hey,\n\n412\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.780\nlet's build our file policy and\nour intrusion policy.\n\n413\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.730\nThat way when we go and we build our\naccess control policy, you know, we've\n\n414\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.010\ngot everything done and we're just ready\nto go, and I'm going to go implement it.\n\n415\n00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.370\nThen when all that's done and now we have\nour configuration on our managed devices,\n\n416\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.630\nwe come back and do our network discovery.\n\n417\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.450\nAnd that's our FireSIGHT, and\nnow it'll start learning your network.\n\n418\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.390\nSo this is the great thing that we're\ngonna learn is, once I do this and\n\n419\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.350\nI get that out there, it'll actually\ncome back and say, I've been looking at\n\n420\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.830\nyour network for a day and you want it to\nrun for a while and you get quality data.\n\n421\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.530\nIt's gonna run for a while,\nI've been looking at your network for\n\n422\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.870\na week\n>> Here's the suggestions that I make.\n\n423\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.070\nAnd this is why I'm saying,\n\n424\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.540\nyou don't have to know anything\nabout Snort, IPS, or anything.\n\n425\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.710\nIf you configure your network in\na simple manner that I'll show you,\n\n426\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.720\nit'll go out there, find the issues, and\ntell you here's how I want to fix that.\n\n427\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.830\nDo you agree, say yes.\n\n428\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.271\n[LAUGH] And then when you push that,\n\n429\n00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:43.831\nyou'll probably stop inspecting\ntraffic for that period of time.\n\n430\n00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:45.042\nYou've got to keep that in mind so\n\n431\n00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:47.526\nyou probably don't want to do that\nat 8 AM Monday morning, right.\n\n432\n00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:50.126\nSo I'm going to show you how to\nschedule those for like, for example,\n\n433\n00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:52.948\nI have a lot of customers that I'll\nschedule things like backups, and one of\n\n434\n00:19:52.948 --> 00:19:56.210\nthe things that I do is update the store\nrules every Friday night at midnight.\n\n435\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.540\nAnd the reason I do it Friday night and\n\n436\n00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.620\nnot Sunday is,\nwhat happens if there's a problem?\n\n437\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.860\nRight?\nI could be alerted,\n\n438\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.940\nI could go into the office.\n\n439\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.719\nIt's not something I want to do, but\n\n440\n00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:04.835\ncertainly better than\nfinding out Monday morning.\n\n441\n00:20:04.835 --> 00:20:07.199\nOkay, so let's go back and\nlet's, let's do this.\n\n442\n00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:09.510\nLet me go back to here.\n\n443\n00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.190\nThis [LAUGH] cracks me up here.\n\n444\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.590\nSo if you see something like this,\nhere's the thing you've got to remember.\n\n445\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:20.080\nThese are your top 15 attack hosts on your\nnetwork, so the one thing that I can do is\n\n446\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.750\nnotice I left click this, and\nnotice some things it says.\n\n447\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.100\nThis is called the security intelligence.\n\n448\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.650\nI can sit here and say, hey,\nthis guy is attacking my host.\n\n449\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.170\nHe's a terrible person, or a terrible guy,\nor whatever, and I can blacklist it now.\n\n450\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.220\nNow the key about this blacklisting\nis that it takes effect immediately.\n\n451\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.690\nSo you need to be careful\nwith this because if you\n\n452\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.640\nactually do like your finance server and\nit had some attack and\n\n453\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.535\nyou blacklist it, well you might\nnot get your paycheck on Friday.\n\n454\n00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.330\nSo you want to be aware of what\nyou're actually blacklisting.\n\n455\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.000\nBecause when you blacklist it it's gone\nforever until you go in and take that out,\n\n456\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.840\nand then update your\naccess control policy.\n\n457\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.630\nIt immediately takes effect.\n\n458\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.720\n>> And if we're managing like ten devices,\nthe blacklist cross all ten?\n\n459\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.310\n>> No, this would only be,\n\n460\n00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.350\nso on this FireSIGHT management center,\nif I blacklist this,\n\n461\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.780\nthis would go into the access control\npolicy that I'm using on here.\n\n462\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.170\n>> Okay.\n>> It depends cuz you guys gotta remember,\n\n463\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.170\nI didn't mention this before so\nthat's a really good question.\n\n464\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.750\nI can have multiple defense centers,\nright?\n\n465\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.650\nAnd you very well may want to do that\nbased on the county or territory,\n\n466\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.490\ndepending on how many you have, right?\n\n467\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.720\nA lot of times we won't take\nall of our managed devices and\n\n468\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.750\nput them all in one\nFireSIGHT management center.\n\n469\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.350\nDoes that make sense?\n\n470\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.770\n>> Right, but\nif I had one access control policy, and\n\n471\n00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.650\nit was applied to say two ASAs?\n\n472\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.806\n>> Then it would take effect\non both of them immediately.\n\n473\n00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:35.090\n>> Okay.\n\n474\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.350\n>> That's the thing about the blacklist.\n\n475\n00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.910\nNow to take it out of the blacklist,\nI have to go take it out by hand and\n\n476\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.400\nthen update my access control policy.\n\n477\n00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.370\nIn this case here, one of their things is,\nhey, we can stop a zero day attack,\n\n478\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.210\nby saying something.\n\n479\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.420\nThese are called indications of\ncompromise and we'll get into that, but\n\n480\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.600\nbasically if we see something like this,\nit's something they're saying, hey,\n\n481\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.940\nyou've got an indication of a compromise,\nyou need to take a look at this right now.\n\n482\n00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.810\nAnd this was the first product,\nactually that has been known in and\n\n483\n00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.610\nwritten down that says we\ncan stop a zero-day attack.\n\n484\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.760\nAnd the way that they do that,\n\n485\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.360\nthese indications on the compromise\nstarted popping up on all these hosts.\n\n486\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.690\nThey came over here and\nblacklisted them and, boom,\n\n487\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.400\nit stopped within just a couple minutes.\n\n488\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.770\nBut, now, again, for\nsomeone paying attention.\n\n489\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.900\nSo, we're looking at our screen,\n\n490\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.260\nand we're not just letting this run in\nthe background without any visibility.\n\n491\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.590\nWe are watching our screen here.\n\n492\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.000\nNow, can I set up some things for\ncorrelation rules and\n\n493\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.410\nautomate some of this stuff?\n\n494\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.740\nAbsolutely, but a zero-day attack, we've\ngot this so, in other words, a lot times I\n\n495\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.935\ntell my my customers leave this screen up\nhere, there's another screen that a lot of\n\n496\n00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:35.220\npeople use it's called the Dashboard, and\nwe'll take a quick look at that actually.\n\n497\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.200\nAnd the reason why is\nthe context explorer,\n\n498\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.310\nthe one we're looking at right\nhere is not customizable.\n\n499\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.620\nYou get what you get and\nthere's some great information.\n\n500\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.520\nThat's my favorite screen.\n\n501\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.860\nSo I'll use that all the time, but a lot\nof my customers use the dash board and\n\n502\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.420\nthe reason they use this is\nbecause it's customizable.\n\n503\n00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.230\nThese things are called ridges and\nit's really running fast here.\n\n504\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.560\nWhen there's a lot of attacks on here and\nit has to do with my connection to it and\n\n505\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.400\nthe defense center,\nthe defense center's virtual, so\n\n506\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.690\nyou, it does run a little bit slower,\nI'd noticed,\n\n507\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.240\nthan an actual appliance that you\nwould buy as a defense center.\n\n508\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.750\n>> Yeah, and it's correlating logs\nfrom multiple devices, logs that have\n\n509\n00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.660\nthousands, hundreds of thousands of\nentries in them, it's gonna work.\n\n510\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.893\n>> Yes, I get customers that just, the way\nthat they set up their policies are hey,\n\n511\n00:23:23.893 --> 00:23:25.884\nI want to see every connection again,\n\n512\n00:23:25.884 --> 00:23:29.702\nI want to see every single packet\nthat comes through my network, right?\n\n513\n00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:33.660\nSo you're gonna have tons of data that go\nthrough if you have something like that.\n\n514\n00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.040\nIn this case here, this allows me to say,\nwell let me move this up here and\n\n515\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.130\nlet me just look at my top stuff\nbecause I have a lot of data\n\n516\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.500\ncoming through; what's important to me.\n\n517\n00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.600\nWe're going to get into reports and\nwhen we talk about that I'm going to\n\n518\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.690\ncustomize this screen and\nthen I can automate this and say,\n\n519\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.220\nhey every Friday send me a report\non the data on this screen.\n\n520\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.460\nVery cool, there is some very\ncool stuff on this screen.\n\n521\n00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.126\nAlright, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the devices for now.\n\n522\n00:23:58.126 --> 00:24:01.752\nSo this is my manage devices,\nwhether they're an ASA Or,\n\n523\n00:24:01.752 --> 00:24:05.971\nan appliance, I can't necessarily\ntell by looking at the screen.\n\n524\n00:24:05.971 --> 00:24:08.205\nOnce I click on the device,\nit'll tell me what it is but\n\n525\n00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:10.550\nin this case here I'm just\ngoing to see managed devices.\n\n526\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.950\nIn this case here I have one in here.\n\n527\n00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.930\nThis says it's a virtual device, so\n\n528\n00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.810\nwe know it is and\nwhat code it's running here.\n\n529\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.630\nI don't if you guys can see this.\n\n530\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.140\nI'll try to make it bigger.\n\n531\n00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:22.960\nI don't know.\n\n532\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.360\nAnd this tells me my licenses,\nand remember,\n\n533\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.050\nI talked about the health and\nthe system policy.\n\n534\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.530\nThis is something that we configure in\ndefense center and push out, mostly,\n\n535\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.020\nthe same one to our managed devices.\n\n536\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.380\nYou don't have to but it's very typical\nthat we would do something like that, and\n\n537\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.800\nthese just give us a basic overview\nconfiguration for management of devices,\n\n538\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.990\nlike time and again, an email relay,\nand SNMP formation, stuff like that and\n\n539\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.730\nthe health policy tells me what to\ntrigger on to tell me on health alert.\n\n540\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.210\nIf I look up here, I see I always get a\nhealth alert event up here and it's green.\n\n541\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.270\nSo, if something goes wrong I\ndon't have to go look in this.\n\n542\n00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.900\nThis icon up here changes for me, it\nsays hey, you need to go out and see and\n\n543\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.800\nthen I'll go down there and freaking out,\n\n544\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.110\nit's like,\nI'm off by one-thousands of a millisecond.\n\n545\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.490\nWhatever, so, sometimes they're serious\nbut anyways, let's go ahead and take\n\n546\n00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.410\na look at this guy and open this up and go\nthrough some of the details of the screen.\n\n547\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.320\nSo, now I'm looking into a device that's\ninside that's already been in here,\n\n548\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.820\nthat's running on my\nfiresight management center,\n\n549\n00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.060\nand we can see the interface\nis in inline sets.\n\n550\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.100\nNow this, I'm not in an ASA right now,\nand I'll show you what an ASA is.\n\n551\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.180\nSo this is actually,\nit's a virtual appliance, but\n\n552\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.620\nit's an appliance,\nnot an ASA in this case.\n\n553\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.130\nA managed device is a managed\ndevice as far as FMC is concerned.\n\n554\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.037\nAs a matter of fact, when you get a van\ntan, one of the problems that I had is\n\n555\n00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:39.030\nwhat managed device did\nthis event come from right?\n\n556\n00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.500\nIt takes some work to find that out but\nin this case here chose my interfaces.\n\n557\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.730\nNow let's explain in lines sets here and\nthis case here on the ASA,\n\n558\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.810\nyou haven't a line set, it comes in\nyour ego's [INAUDIBLE] that right and\n\n559\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:55.060\nthat's basically how its working, north\nand south in this case and that's our ASA.\n\n560\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.800\nAnd so\nwe basically are analyzing traffic as\n\n561\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.720\nit comes in from the outside\nto the inside, right?\n\n562\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.440\nThat's an in line set.\n\n563\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.740\nNow when we have an actual appliance,\nwe buy the appliance, right, and\n\n564\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.490\nyou're kind of doing the side\nlittle approach, and\n\n565\n00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.350\nyou're creating different boxes depending\non the through put that you need.\n\n566\n00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.220\nThen you would, you could,\nyou don't have to have an in line set.\n\n567\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.230\nTypically that's what you want to do,\nthat's how you get the best bang for\n\n568\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.890\nyour buck.\n\n569\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.290\nThat's how you stop traffic and\ndrop malware, but\n\n570\n00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.590\nthere's other things you can do.\n\n571\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.940\nYou can create MS routers or\nswitches and just, as firewalls,\n\n572\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.950\nand just monitor the devices.\n\n573\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.520\nIn line sets are probably\ntypically the way you want to go.\n\n574\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.030\nNow on the device here,\nlet's talk about some of the stuff here.\n\n575\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.800\nIt's slightly different on ASA but not\nthat much where I'd need to change this.\n\n576\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.830\nThe first thing here is,\nthe general is just the name.\n\n577\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.810\nThis is just basically here,\nthis isn't even important,\n\n578\n00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.450\nit's not even on reports but notice here,\nit says transfer packets, okay.\n\n579\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.240\nNow, when I start to add a device and\nI'll show you how to do that in a minute.\n\n580\n00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.870\nIt's gonna come up and\nit's gonna say, all right,\n\n581\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.720\ngive me the IP address of the device\nthat you want to put in the FMC.\n\n582\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.230\nGive me the password that you set on\nthere and what access control policy, so\n\n583\n00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.770\nit makes you apply an ACP and there is\na default one that's basically empty.\n\n584\n00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.780\nIt doesn't do anything, but\nyou have to apply an ACP.\n\n585\n00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.250\nYou just can't get around it and\nthen it asks you questions like,\n\n586\n00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.040\nare you behind in that and then,\ndo you wanna transfer packets?\n\n587\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.190\nAnd, the answer is we do and,\nthe reason why is because,\n\n588\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.500\nif I don't transfer packets then\nI'm gonna get a threat score.\n\n589\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.635\nI'm not gonna have the actual file.\n\n590\n00:27:22.635 --> 00:27:26.285\nIf I actually transfer the packets\nthen I can actually download them or\n\n591\n00:27:26.285 --> 00:27:27.915\nsend them back up for analysis.\n\n592\n00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:30.185\nSo, I always tell them,\nhey, transfer packets.\n\n593\n00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:32.605\nIf buffers fill up then\nthey'll just overflow, but\n\n594\n00:27:32.605 --> 00:27:36.800\nthe fact is you want to get these files\nbecause then you can analyze them later.\n\n595\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.870\nYou can look at them,\nyou can look at them on Wireshark.\n\n596\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.260\nThere is a lot we can do as you'll\nsee as we get into analysis we'll see\n\n597\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.180\nwhy you wanna do this and it's not\nnecessarily hurting your throughput and\n\n598\n00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.220\nso on, but you can just consider this,\nI would turn that on.\n\n599\n00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.180\nNow in this case here since it's\nan appliance we get these extra\n\n600\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.770\nbuttons up here.\n\n601\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.960\nThis one's a shut down.\n\n602\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.440\nNow, let's say we actually have\nan appliance and I click this button.\n\n603\n00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.820\nNow I'd be in big trouble if that\nwas a remote device because to go,\n\n604\n00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.660\nto turn it back on, I actually\nhave to go push a button, right?\n\n605\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.560\nSo, be careful with this.\n\n606\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.440\nNow this will restart it, and\nthis just tells me what it is, and\n\n607\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.120\nwhat the system policy it's using,\nand the version here.\n\n608\n00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.880\nNot a lot important here, but\nlet's talk about this down here.\n\n609\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.770\nThis is kind of important,\nthis is called application bypassing.\n\n610\n00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.240\nThis is a decision that you have to make.\n\n611\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.950\nSo I tell all my students,\nthere's decisions you guys have to make.\n\n612\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.000\nDo I transfer packets?\n\n613\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.690\nI tend to say,\nnot much of a decision there because\n\n614\n00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.380\nonce I show you the analysis\nnow we get in there, you're\n\n615\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.740\ngonna go man I'm sure glad we transferred\npackets cuz this is a lot of fun now.\n\n616\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.590\nNow I have these packets to play with.\n\n617\n00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.900\nSo, when I come down here\nwith the application bypass,\n\n618\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.230\nthis is not enabled by default, so\nbasically I'm going to come in here and\n\n619\n00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.370\nturn this on, and it's going to say\n3,000 milliseconds, three seconds,\n\n620\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:46.485\nI'm going to say, if a file comes in, and\nit's hitting a certain snort rule rule,\n\n621\n00:28:46.485 --> 00:28:48.585\nthat's a smart rule saying,\nhey, I'm triggering.\n\n622\n00:28:48.585 --> 00:28:50.505\nWhy I'm looking at this,\nI'm analyzing this, but\n\n623\n00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.955\nit take more than three\nseconds to make a decision.\n\n624\n00:28:54.245 --> 00:28:55.645\nIt kind of considers that,\n\n625\n00:28:55.645 --> 00:28:59.685\nmaybe this smart rule's kind of hosed, or\nwhatever but basically if I turn this on,\n\n626\n00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:03.115\nit's saying, if it takes more than\nthree seconds, just send the file.\n\n627\n00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:06.795\nWe'd rather err on the side of\nconnectivity than we are on security\n\n628\n00:29:06.795 --> 00:29:08.010\nin this case here, right?\n\n629\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:13.120\nSo, in this case here,\nautomatic application bypass,\n\n630\n00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.660\nthis is going to allow me to bypass it so\n\n631\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.450\nit actually disables that particular snort\nrule for about, I think it's five minutes,\n\n632\n00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.600\nit's in the system pause configurable and\nthen it re-enables that snort rule.\n\n633\n00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.990\nSo, for that period of time,\n\n634\n00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:30.550\nthis configured in your system policy that\nfile from that application will continue\n\n635\n00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:35.130\nto transfer without inspection until\nthat's triggered on this certain server.\n\n636\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.490\nIn this case here, if we say no and\nI leave this here, application bypass.\n\n637\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.960\nNo, I'm gonna sit here until\nthe snort rule decides what to do.\n\n638\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.290\nI am not gonna transfer the file.\n\n639\n00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.740\n>> And if you're in a high security\nenvironment, an environment that has\n\n640\n00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.780\na security compliance policy that says\nyou have to filter, that's what you need.\n\n641\n00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.640\nYou don't want stuff bypassing the filter,\nright?\n\n642\n00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.030\n>> Yeah, I've been in HIPAA places,\nhospitals, and so on like that.\n\n643\n00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.950\nThey said we can't send uninspected data,\nit's not legal.\n\n644\n00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.050\nSo, in this case here you're not\ngoing to be able to get the file.\n\n645\n00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.570\nThat's a decision you have to make.\n\n646\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.370\nNow on this case here,\nthis is our licenses now.\n\n647\n00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.890\nThese are just when I add the device\nin here it's going to say\n\n648\n00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.940\nhey do you have your license.\n\n649\n00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.010\nNow I wanna go through this.\n\n650\n00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.360\nThis is extremely important to you.\n\n651\n00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.710\nWhen you have your FMC before\nyou add your managed devices,\n\n652\n00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.890\nyou want to license your FMC.\n\n653\n00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:26.081\nYou don't license your managed devices,\nyou manage your defend center for\n\n654\n00:30:26.081 --> 00:30:30.310\nthe appliances or\nthe managed devices you're going to have.\n\n655\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.070\nDo you understand?\n\n656\n00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.993\nThe fact is that the licenses if I remove\na managed device stay on the defend\n\n657\n00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:35.534\ncenter.\n\n658\n00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:39.720\nSo, let's say that we were going to have,\nyou can get like a ten user pack or\n\n659\n00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.790\nwhatever and\nyou can put that on your FMC and so\n\n660\n00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.840\nnow I can have up to ten\nmanaged devices on there.\n\n661\n00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.530\nIf I remove one and put another one in,\nI take off those license, and\n\n662\n00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:52.500\nas that device leaves, then put it\nback on as it comes into this FMC.\n\n663\n00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.390\nAll right.\nIn,\n\n664\n00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.192\ntypically this is here to just\nshow you that, hey, they're here.\n\n665\n00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:58.470\nI've had some customers\nnever think saying,\n\n666\n00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.050\nthis isn't working because when\nyou go in and they add a device,\n\n667\n00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.080\nwhich I'll show you in a second, you're\ngoing to see that it only asks you for\n\n668\n00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.640\nthe IPS license, which is for\ntact, right, protect and control.\n\n669\n00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.120\nAnd in this case here, we want to\nmaybe add malware neurofiltering or\n\n670\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.100\nsomething like that, and\nthat wasn't on by default.\n\n671\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.892\nOkay, so here's my health policy,\nand then my management.\n\n672\n00:31:15.892 --> 00:31:20.280\nLet's say this is a particular device,\nand I can have multiple devices in here.\n\n673\n00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.440\nI can sit here and say I don't want to\nmanage this right now and basically it's\n\n674\n00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.010\nbecause maybe I'm taking it out for\nmaintenance or something like that, right?\n\n675\n00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.950\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n676\n00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.060\ntake a look at what we'd look like if\nwe added a device but let's come back\n\n677\n00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.760\nto that, we'll add a device, and\nwe'll start doing an install and an ASA.\n\n678\n00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.470\n>> Yeah, and I know we're running a little\nshort on time in this episode, so\n\n679\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.080\nwhy don't we,\nwhy don't we show adding a device, and\n\n680\n00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.790\nthen we can do actually upgrading\nan ASA maybe the next episode.\n\n681\n00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.460\n>> And all start from the scratch.\n\n682\n00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.570\nThat sounds good.\n\n683\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.712\n>> Sure.\nSo, what you're doing here is\n\n684\n00:31:50.712 --> 00:31:53.401\nyou're just going in and you're,\nyou're taking an existing device, and\n\n685\n00:31:53.401 --> 00:31:55.560\nyou're going to tack it in so\nwe'll get a chance to see that.\n\n686\n00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.489\n>> Well, at, at this point I'm not\ngoing to add anything because I\n\n687\n00:31:57.489 --> 00:31:58.370\ndon't have anything to add into here.\n\n688\n00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.878\n>> Oh. [LAUGH] >> After this next section,\n\n689\n00:31:59.878 --> 00:32:03.312\nI'm going to create something to put\ninto a new defense center, right?\n\n690\n00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:03.996\n>> Absolutely.\n\n691\n00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:05.668\n>> So, this host is the, oops.\n\n692\n00:32:05.668 --> 00:32:10.977\nThis host is the IP address, and\nthe registration key, very simple.\n\n693\n00:32:10.977 --> 00:32:13.436\nI typically just type in Cisco or\nsomething.\n\n694\n00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:17.544\nBut it basically on the managed device\nin this case where we'll be using ASAs,\n\n695\n00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:20.682\nI'm gonna go in there and say,\nhey, my password is Cisco.\n\n696\n00:32:20.682 --> 00:32:24.060\nI can group a bunch of them together.\n\n697\n00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.374\nI typically don't do this, but\nyou can if you have a large install,\n\n698\n00:32:26.374 --> 00:32:28.250\nwe'd see something like this.\n\n699\n00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.770\nNow the access control policy if i come in\nhere, and I put an IP address in the key,\n\n700\n00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:36.520\nnotice that nothing else here is clicked,\nbut I have to have this.\n\n701\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.537\nIt won't let me register without an IPS\nlicense right, so, I have to have this,\n\n702\n00:32:40.537 --> 00:32:41.852\nI have a minimum protect.\n\n703\n00:32:41.852 --> 00:32:43.688\nIn this case here,\nthese lit up that says here hey,\n\n704\n00:32:43.688 --> 00:32:46.062\nyou have a control malware in URL filter,\ndo you want to use them?\n\n705\n00:32:46.062 --> 00:32:48.690\nI 'm going to say, yes, I do.\n\n706\n00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.835\nOkay?\nSo now we're gonna talk about something\n\n707\n00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:54.811\nelse that I saw down here, and that's\nthe Advance key, the Advance section here.\n\n708\n00:32:54.811 --> 00:32:58.791\nIf I'm behind a NAT firewall, I gotta tell\nyou guys, this gets a little convoluted,\n\n709\n00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.352\nand I'm not gonna get into this.\n\n710\n00:33:00.352 --> 00:33:03.009\nIf in doubt, then you're gonna go\nup here to your help screen and\n\n711\n00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:04.644\nit's gonna help you understand this.\n\n712\n00:33:04.644 --> 00:33:07.936\nPutting your managed device behind a NAT\ndevice can get complicated really fast.\n\n713\n00:33:07.936 --> 00:33:10.228\nBut here's the transfer packets.\n\n714\n00:33:10.228 --> 00:33:14.260\nNow, we saw that, if I unclick this here,\nonce I go and I can edit devices and\n\n715\n00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.130\nturn that back on at any time.\n\n716\n00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.436\nThat wasn't a capability in the past.\n\n717\n00:33:17.436 --> 00:33:20.977\nYou had to take the device out and\nput it back in to do this.\n\n718\n00:33:20.977 --> 00:33:24.441\nSo, at this point, I would register it and\ntake a couple minutes, and\n\n719\n00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:27.260\nthen FMC would come back and\nsay, success, here I am.\n\n720\n00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.191\nAnd I can then apply my health and\nsystem policy, my access,\n\n721\n00:33:30.191 --> 00:33:31.812\nand I'll have that all applied.\n\n722\n00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:34.789\nAnd then I'm like,\nif I've already configured my policies,\n\n723\n00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:37.550\nthen I'll push out the access\ncontrol policy, and boom.\n\n724\n00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.227\nThe box is out there working.\n\n725\n00:33:39.227 --> 00:33:41.299\n>> Now, does the device need to be\nonline when you're doing this, or\n\n726\n00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:41.936\ncan we prestage it?\n\n727\n00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:44.811\nI guess if you had a license.\n\n728\n00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:47.070\n>> Yeah, you can prestage it,\nas long as you can get to the management.\n\n729\n00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.790\nSo, you have a host.\n\n730\n00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.410\nYou have your FireSIGHT Management Center\nand your licensing in there, and\n\n731\n00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.080\nyou can prestage it.\n\n732\n00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.352\nThe key is, though,\nthat you're putting it into this FMC.\n\n733\n00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:59.199\nYou're saying, well, I can pre-stage\nit and configure it mostly, but\n\n734\n00:33:59.199 --> 00:34:02.936\nI'm just not gonna put the FMC\ninformation, whom I'm gonna add it to.\n\n735\n00:34:02.936 --> 00:34:05.061\nSo, we'll actually do\nthat in the next section.\n\n736\n00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:05.760\n>> Okay, excellent.\n\n737\n00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.019\nWell, Tom, that's probably a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n738\n00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:11.978\nI know I know a lot of the viewers\nare excited to see it too.\n\n739\n00:34:11.978 --> 00:34:16.394\nWe wanna see taking an ASA and getting it\nkinda flipped over to running FirePOWER.\n\n740\n00:34:16.394 --> 00:34:19.051\nWe want to get that join in and\nmanage cuz that's really the meat and\n\n741\n00:34:19.051 --> 00:34:20.290\npotatoes of getting started.\n\n742\n00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.477\nAnd from there the real excitement can\nstart where we actually start filtering.\n\n743\n00:34:23.477 --> 00:34:27.769\nAnd seeing it attack traffic and all that\nso, definitely looking forward to that.\n\n744\n00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.115\nBut we'll wrap this episode here,\nstay tuned, because when we come back,\n\n745\n00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:34.357\nwere going to jump into that actually,\ngetting an ASA added in there, and\n\n746\n00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:36.760\nmanaged and see all the excitement begin.\n\n747\n00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.600\n>> Absolutely.\n\n748\n00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.751\n>> Do you have any final thoughts\nyou want to throw in before we wrap\n\n749\n00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:41.030\nthis episode up?\n\n750\n00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.120\n>> [LAUGH] Stick around,\nthis is a great, exciting product.\n\n751\n00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.330\nI get very enthusiastic, and\nagain I can't say enough about it.\n\n752\n00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.480\nBut here's the deal, I know we're\ngiving you a lot of information, but I\n\n753\n00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.290\npromise you at the end it will all, if you\nstick around it will all come together.\n\n754\n00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.710\nAnd, it'll all make sense.\n\n755\n00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.378\nRight now it might seem like a jumbled\nmess but, think of it more of a symphony\n\n756\n00:34:59.378 --> 00:35:01.350\nwhere we got a bunch of\ndifferent instruments playing.\n\n757\n00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.066\nAnd by the end we create this symphony,\nit all comes together and\n\n758\n00:35:04.066 --> 00:35:06.190\nit sounds beautiful and\nthat's our goal, guys.\n\n759\n00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.440\nSo, I understand this can be overwhelming\nand it's hard to understand a lot of this\n\n760\n00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.436\nstuff but if you hang in there,\nit'll all work together.\n\n761\n00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:14.727\n>> It's definitely rewarding.\n\n762\n00:35:14.727 --> 00:35:17.269\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you guys enjoyed that episode.\n\n763\n00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:17.852\nStay tuned.\n\n764\n00:35:17.852 --> 00:35:22.472\nWe've got more FirePOWER coming up,\nbut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n765\n00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:23.477\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n766\n00:35:23.477 --> 00:35:24.603\n>> I'm Todd Lammle.\n\n767\n00:35:24.603 --> 00:35:25.812\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:18.180\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.190\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Cisco FirePower.\n\n5\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.130\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ngetting a chance to see how to install\n\n6\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.310\nFirePower on an ASA,\nif it doesn't already have it.\n\n7\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.940\nAnd to integrate that into our FirePower\nsolution, really start to take some\n\n8\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.770\naction and get this stuff working for\nus, so it's pretty exciting.\n\n9\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.870\nI know I've been looking forward to it.\n\n10\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.510\nYou guys probably have been too.\n\n11\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.930\nAnd back again on the show to help us out,\n\n12\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.400\nwe've got Todd Lammle who's gonna\nwalk us through the process.\n\n13\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.440\nTodd, take it away.\n\n14\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.680\n>> Yeah, let's get right to it, guys.\n\n15\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.000\nOn this section here,\nwe're gonna get right into insulation.\n\n16\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.880\nFirst of all, I have a document here that\nI use for my classes and for demos, for\n\n17\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.870\nmy customers and so on, but\nlet's take a look at the lab layout here.\n\n18\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.300\nI know what you're thinking, hey,\nhow do I get this document and all that?\n\n19\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.630\nWell, the answer is, you're not going to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.540\n>> You can, when you come to class,\n\n21\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.660\nand I'm not trying to be mean, what I'm\nsaying is, it won't do you any good,\n\n22\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.210\nwhat are you going to do with it.\n\n23\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.190\nSo the fact is, unless you have this exact\nnetwork, right, with these exact IPs, and\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.740\nso on in the same attack.\n\n25\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.960\nThis isn't like just taking a router and\n\n26\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.980\nI'm giving you a lab on hey,\nhere's a basic router.\n\n27\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.520\nThis doesn't work that way.\n\n28\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.130\nRight.\n\n29\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.600\nSo in this case here we're taking a look.\n\n30\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.310\nWe have the ASA.\n\n31\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.220\nWe have, here's my management now.\n\n32\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.720\nRemember, I told you, I named my inside PC\nand I have my defense center right here.\n\n33\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.890\nAnd these are all virtual, but\n\n34\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.230\nthey're connected to link on\nto the management server port.\n\n35\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.670\nInsight here is, my inside network, which\nwe, this is my, I have a host to attack\n\n36\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.280\nand we have an outside host, so\nI got a very simple network here.\n\n37\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980\nBut I have an outside attack calylinks.\n\n38\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.490\nI'll show you guys this,\nit's really, really fun, you're\n\n39\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.610\ngonna make me want to do this and then\nyou just send attacks through here and\n\n40\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.470\nwe pick them up here and\nthen we need a Windows server in this so\n\n41\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.010\nwhen you have those firepower, as we\ntalked about you need a Windows server.\n\n42\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.680\nYou need an Ldap and AD.\n\n43\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.990\nAnd yeah, I can use Radius for\nsomething like that,\n\n44\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.330\nbut I highly recommend using ADB,\nbecause it allows us access into\n\n45\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.160\nour access control policy, users will\nshow you why you want to do this.\n\n46\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.750\nAnd there's also something on here\ncalled Source Fire User Agents, S-F-U-A.\n\n47\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.330\nAnd what that does is, it talks to\nFiresite and gives me the login in log\n\n48\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.380\noffs of, the AD users, and so\nnow, I find out who it is, right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.140\nAnd so it gives me powerful\nfire side information.\n\n50\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.917\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n51\n00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.821\nAll right, so, let's come down here.\n\n52\n00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:27.410\nNow, I've got two ASAs.\n\n53\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.520\nLet's go over here for one quick second,\n\n54\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.850\nand I'll make these as large\nas possible guys to see.\n\n55\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.330\nSo I've got ASA here and here and\n\n56\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.780\nthis guy here, it does not have\nthe source fire module in it.\n\n57\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.360\nAnd this guy here, I bought and\nhe has a source fire module in there.\n\n58\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.100\nThat's not the reality, but\nthat's how I set it up, right?\n\n59\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.595\nSo the fact is,\ntoday you are going to go out and\n\n60\n00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:49.855\nbuy an ASA with a firepower module and\nthis is the way it's going to come.\n\n61\n00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:50.575\nIt's already installed.\n\n62\n00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:55.104\nSo, like even if I did 'show module', and\nI can see there's my firepower model,\n\n63\n00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:56.415\nmy source fire module.\n\n64\n00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:59.525\nAnd I just got to go in and\nconfigure it and I'm good.\n\n65\n00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:01.755\nAnd here's the deal about managed devices.\n\n66\n00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.205\nVery little configuration.\n\n67\n00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.860\nAll of it's done from\nthe fireside management side.\n\n68\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.340\nRight, so we get it connected.\n\n69\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.550\nAll we want to do is\nconfigure it a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.680\nThere's a few commands.\n\n71\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.760\nI'll show you some\ncontrols you can command.\n\n72\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.520\nBut, there's very little you would do.\n\n73\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.240\nThis isn't a command line product.\n\n74\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.350\nSo, we'll use the fire\nsite management sitter.\n\n75\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.210\nOn this one here, it needs to be upgraded.\n\n76\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.710\nI don't have the module in there yet.\n\n77\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.130\nAnd, on this model here,\nit's a software model.\n\n78\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.190\nAlright, so let's come down here and\nsee the command.\n\n79\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.990\nThe first thing I need to do is configure\nthe ASA Sourcefire boot image location.\n\n80\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.070\nFilename is case sensitive, so\nI'm going to find out what disk it is,\n\n81\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.670\nso it's SF-module module SFR recovery\nconfigure image from this disk,\n\n82\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.530\nand here's the image.\n\n83\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.180\nSo that has to be in there.\n\n84\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.550\nAnd I'm going to put that and I'm going to\nsay go ahead and next time we boot we're\n\n85\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.670\ngoing to use this, so I don't know how\nhard that is to see, can you see that Don?\n\n86\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.580\n>> Yes.\nAnd for\n\n87\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.610\nthe viewers out there if they've got\nan ASA that didn't have fire power and\n\n88\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.860\nthey go and they buy that license and they\nget it added to their Smart Net agreement\n\n89\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.730\n>> Yes, this is what you want to do\n\n90\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.010\n>> They would go to Cisco's website,\n\n91\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.460\ntheir support site, support.cisco.com,\nand they would download this image, and\n\n92\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.140\nput it on the SA, right.\n\n93\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.330\nAnd then this is what\nis actually activating,\n\n94\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.630\nbecause otherwise the image is just\nsitting there doing nothing, right?\n\n95\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.900\n>> Yeah.\nThat is exactly right.\n\n96\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.570\nSo we're going to go here and\nI'm going to paste this into the SA, and\n\n97\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.020\nI'm going to say,\nI didn't do anything at this time.\n\n98\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.160\nI just want to say, hey the next time boot\nthis is what we're going to use, right?\n\n99\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.340\nSo we come back to over here,\nand we'll load the image.\n\n100\n00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.490\nAnd I'm going to say okay now that we know\nwhat image it is we're going to go ahead\n\n101\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.500\nand recover boot soft SF module\nmodule SFR recover boot.\n\n102\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.200\nNow if you wanted to find these\ncommands outside of here just type in\n\n103\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.870\ninstalling SFR module on an ASA and\nyou'll see these commands here.\n\n104\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.830\nYou know this isn't something I made up\n>> LAUGHTER\n\n105\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.190\n>> These are commands I use all the time\n\n106\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.800\n>> Okay, so\n\n107\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.830\nnow I have my two commands in there and\nyou'll notice it says, oh okay,\n\n108\n00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.360\nlook at this,\nrecover module SFR will be recovered.\n\n109\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.290\nAll right, so we're going to say, yes.\n\n110\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.450\nSo we put our boot module in there,\nwe told it to go ahead and recover, and\n\n111\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.520\ndo that boot image there.\n\n112\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.720\nBut we're not done yet.\n\n113\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.470\nSo in this case here, we'll see this.\n\n114\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.150\nIt says here, we recovered and,\nthis will take about 10 minutes.\n\n115\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.370\nAlright, so it's loading the module,\nit's booting the image, and\n\n116\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.280\nit's going to go out there now.\n\n117\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.110\nWe haven't loaded the actual software yet.\n\n118\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.160\nThis is just the boot image so\nwe can load the software.\n\n119\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.260\nDoes that make sense?\n\n120\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.319\nSo we've got this boot image.\n\n121\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.850\nAnd then I'm gonna come in here and\n\n122\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.630\nI'll session in to the consul\nin about ten minutes.\n\n123\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.040\nSo, basically, let's put it in\nthe oven for a minute alright and\n\n124\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.290\nwe're gonna come back here.\n\n125\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.470\nAgain, we're installing this,\n\n126\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.770\nthis is actually going to take\na couple hours guys, a couple hours.\n\n127\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.370\nSo, during the time this is upgrading\ntoday we'll work on one that's\n\n128\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.290\nalready been baked alright?\n\n129\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.960\nDoes that sound good?\n\n130\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.315\nI didn't mean that in\nlike the Colorado sense.\n\n131\n00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:49.830\n[LAUGH] I live in Colorado, and\nthat has a different meaning there.\n\n132\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.720\nAlright, so I'm going to come here and\nsay, this is a new way of saying I bought\n\n133\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.220\nit with the firepower module, and I'm\ngoing to say session SFR console, right?\n\n134\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.040\nAnd notice that's going\nto take me in there.\n\n135\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.840\nOkay so notice the prompt here,\nnow I've mentioned this earlier.\n\n136\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.450\nHere's that Source Fire 3D,\nthat's the old term for\n\n137\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.080\ntheir client, their managed devices right,\ntheir sensors at the time.\n\n138\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.340\nSo we still see that at times,\nI'm sure maybe that'll go away.\n\n139\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.854\nI don't speak for Cisco.\n\n140\n00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:22.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I need to make that clear.\n\n141\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.480\nNow in this case here it's admin so\nwhen you first log in remember this is\n\n142\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.330\none that's already bagged, that's already\ncooked, from pulling it out the oven.\n\n143\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.400\nI ordered this ASA with\nthe Fire Power module on it.\n\n144\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.100\nAnd in this case here I sessioned into\nthe module, we did a show module,\n\n145\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.790\nsaw that it was there sessioned into it.\n\n146\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.490\nAnd the password it's\nadmin with source fire.\n\n147\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.250\nAnd notice that coming and saying,\nwell, okay, great, I'm not configured.\n\n148\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.590\nFirst off,\nlet's look at my 5,000 page EULA.\n\n149\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.460\nRight, this is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n150\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.700\nThis one of the longest ones I ever.\n\n151\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.400\nI've seen some long ones.\n\n152\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.010\nThis one is really long.\n\n153\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.310\nAnd I'm just gonna hit the q key and\nget out of that, right?\n\n154\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.065\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nagree to this.\n\n155\n00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:07.870\nOkay, so I'll bring this one up.\n\n156\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.540\nWe're letting this other guy\ncook in the background, right?\n\n157\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.690\nHe's gonna be up in a few minutes.\n\n158\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.946\nIt's gonna say \"Enter a Password\",\nwhat's your new password,\n\n159\n00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:15.540\nimmediately it's gonna\nhave you change that.\n\n160\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.830\nSo, I'm gonna type in the password,\nand confirm the new password.\n\n161\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.860\nAnd then it says do you\nwant to configure it now.\n\n162\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.330\nYou guys understand this you're\ngonna configure this product twice.\n\n163\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.720\nOn this one here we're doing for\n\n164\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.540\nthe second we're basically doing it for\nthe last time.\n\n165\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.290\nOn this one here where I'm upgrading the\nproduct then I actually come in here and\n\n166\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.700\nit asks me to configure this.\n\n167\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.080\nIt goes out and downloads a system\ninstall file and then I'm here.\n\n168\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.860\nAnd then I have to configure it again.\n\n169\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.910\nSo on this case here I configure\nit twice on this one here.\n\n170\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.480\nI configure it just once here.\n\n171\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.950\nSee if I can bring this up.\n\n172\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.520\nKeep these straight.\n\n173\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.420\nRight?\nI'm going to configure four not six.\n\n174\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.500\nAnd, what pod am I on here?\n\n175\n00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.180\nLooks like two.\n\n176\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.797\nAll right I just had to\nmake sure where I'm at.\n\n177\n00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:01.421\nBefore you guys do any of this you already\nhave to have all your information.\n\n178\n00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:02.420\nBetter have your design.\n\n179\n00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.212\nYour IP addresses You need a DNS server,\nan NTP server, and a domain name, right?\n\n180\n00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:10.570\nWe need all that information before\nwe start configuring this, okay.\n\n181\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.600\nThis is going to be 10.11.\n\n182\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.140\n10.20 and\nthis is a scheme that I came up with, or\n\n183\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.680\nme and my business partner in this.\n\n184\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.820\nWe came up with this, and said, this\nis the scheme that we're going to use.\n\n185\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.500\nOkay, and then, 10.11.10.1,\nthat's my default gateway.\n\n186\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.670\nSo again, I'm not making these up.\n\n187\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.230\nThis is based on my network design\nif I go out and look at that.\n\n188\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.690\nSo this has to be done beforehand.\n\n189\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.130\nYou can't just randomly make these up,\nright.\n\n190\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.790\nThat would be kind of nice wouldn't it.\n\n191\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.930\nAnd a fully qualified domain name,\nnotice that it comes up and\n\n192\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.490\nsays, hey, do you want to use the source\nfire [LAUGHS] and we're not, all right?\n\n193\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.940\nI mean, I've got my own domain\non here that needs set up.\n\n194\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.990\nSome notes, I came back,\nit doesn't let you backspace, all right?\n\n195\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.720\nOkay, and list Dns servers,\nno search domains\n\n196\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.620\nis SFGCT.local, and\nthat's all I pretty much need, and\n\n197\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.940\nhonestly, I just need one more command,\nand I can be in my defense center.\n\n198\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.060\nSo at this point,\nit's gonna come back up, and\n\n199\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.470\nthis takes a couple minutes as well,\nbecause notice, what it's doing now.\n\n200\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.130\nIt didn't used to do this before.\n\n201\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.840\nIt just didn't let you apply it.\n\n202\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.670\nSo, notice,\nit's applying an access control policy.\n\n203\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.840\nIt doesn't allow you to get around that,\nit's saying okay, you don't have one, but\n\n204\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.200\nI'm gonna put a default one on there.\n\n205\n00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.720\nThere's really,\nit's like access list with nothing in it,\n\n206\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.620\nbut it's gonna apply one nonetheless.\n\n207\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.730\n>> So, this is really doing just the bare\nminimum to get this thing where we\n\n208\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.725\ncan manage it in the management center.\n\n209\n00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:39.885\n>> It's not gonna give you any security or\nanything like that, but\n\n210\n00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:42.895\nit's gonna bring it up so\nyou can configure it, absolutely.\n\n211\n00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:46.135\nLet's go back to our other one\nthat's in the oven, right?\n\n212\n00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:47.675\nAnd we can see if it's done.\n\n213\n00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.685\nSFR console and when it lets me in then,\n\n214\n00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:51.370\nI know it's done so\n>> Not done in the oven yet,\n\n215\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.450\nwe're still cooking and in this case,\nhere this takes a couple minutes as well,\n\n216\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.730\nso in both cases here this\nguy is installing right?\n\n217\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.710\nThe boot system file it's loading that and\n\n218\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.230\nthen we gotta go do the system file,\nright?\n\n219\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.970\nThis guy's one from new.\n\n220\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.080\nThis guy's one that we bought\nwith the module already in it.\n\n221\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.400\nThat wasn't the case here, but\nthat's how I built this lab here.\n\n222\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.440\nWe basically need to pause right\nnow because we're in a hurry up and\n\n223\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.400\nwait situation.\n\n224\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.120\n>> Absolutely.\n\n225\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.079\n>> These will probably come\nback at the same time.\n\n226\n00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just give me five minutes.\n\n227\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.630\nSo I have two Asus's,\nwhich we have discussed.\n\n228\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:36.190\nOne was a new one that we're\nupgrading the module to firepower.\n\n229\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.580\nAnd this one already had\nit when I bought it.\n\n230\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.560\nAnd click the box that said hey,\nadd firepower, right?\n\n231\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.990\nAnd it's really not a lot\nof money to add that.\n\n232\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.170\nIt's not where the money is, right?\n\n233\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.800\nWe discussed that that's in the licensing\nsection so yeah, we can add it and\n\n234\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.220\nit's very cost effective to buy this\non any device, we'll take a look.\n\n235\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.870\nBut let's start here.\n\n236\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.110\nThis one is going to take longer now.\n\n237\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.540\nThis one is ready to connect\nto my defense center but\n\n238\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.590\nwe have to type in a command first but\nlet's go ahead and move on to this guy.\n\n239\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.640\nFirst off, when I get to this point,\nand all I've done is moved a file that\n\n240\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.100\nsays move this module, so the password's\nadmin and then capital admin, one,\n\n241\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.470\ntwo, three And now I'll get in here.\n\n242\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.430\nSo if I come back over here,\nand I'll show you.\n\n243\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.900\nSo, we're basically here, I got it.\n\n244\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.720\nYeah here we are, right here.\n\n245\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.270\nAnd so you can see this admin, Admin123.\n\n246\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:28.140\nNow, this is the first time you can see\nASA SFR login, and that's my login.\n\n247\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.610\nAnd this is a one time password.\n\n248\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.410\nCapital Admin123.\n\n249\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.840\nOnce I put that in It's going\nto ask me to configure.\n\n250\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.120\nNow, this is a temporary configuration.\n\n251\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.180\nBasically so\nI can pull down the system file.\n\n252\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.330\nOnce I pull down the system file,\nnow we're back at,\n\n253\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.650\nhey, this is where I bought it.\n\n254\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.570\nThis is my second one here.\n\n255\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.980\nSo, noticed I'm at boot.\n\n256\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.970\nIf you're at this point,\nyour box is not working.\n\n257\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.030\nYour module is not working.\n\n258\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.190\nYou don't have a system file.\n\n259\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.430\nYou just have your boot system configured.\n\n260\n00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.460\nSo, we'll type set-up.\n\n261\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.210\nAnd, you know you can change the name\nhere, but again, you're reconfiguring it.\n\n262\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.860\nSo I just kinda leave it\nbecause I could say, hey yeah,\n\n263\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.810\nyou know what, this is Pod1S so far.\n\n264\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.560\nThat's great.\n\n265\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.980\nBut again, when I come back in have the\nsystem file have to reconfigure all this,\n\n266\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.380\nso doesn't even matter.\n\n267\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.970\nManagement interface, no DACP,\nI want it manual 10.11.10.10, and\n\n268\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.800\nagain I already know this IP,\nI didn't make these up.\n\n269\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.260\n10.11.10.1 is my default gateway.\n\n270\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.160\nAnd what I am configuring,\nis this is an upgrade that I am doing, and\n\n271\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.820\nI'm configuring it so I can get to my FTP\nserver, so I can download the system file.\n\n272\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.250\nOkay, no IPv6, DNS server 10 11 11 2 50.\n\n273\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:42.620\nNot a lot of stuff that\nI really need here.\n\n274\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.995\nLocal domain name will say, yeah.\n\n275\n00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:49.920\nSFGTC.LOCAL, I'll say no to this.\n\n276\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.370\nYes on the NTP in this case.\n\n277\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.640\n10 11 11 2 50.\nSo make sure you have your DNS server, And\n\n278\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.540\nyour NTP will start working\nbefore you start working on this.\n\n279\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.360\nThis guys they really like it and\n\n280\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.320\nthey start complaining if they\ndon't have this information, right?\n\n281\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.710\nso we're going to say yes there and\nput IP address.\n\n282\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.620\nOkay no key can do, is this what you want\nto use at this point, you say no and\n\n283\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.390\nstart it over again no big deal.\n\n284\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.290\nAnd I say yes Notice I am\nat the boot prompt here.\n\n285\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.990\nSo let's go back back and\nsee where we're at.\n\n286\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:27.640\nSo I came through here and configure, and\nfollow along with the class, the domain.\n\n287\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.410\nIt says, At the boot.\n\n288\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.230\nNow.\nNow I wanna do the system file.\n\n289\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.850\nNow I'm gonna download the system file and\nthis is something we'll do and\n\n290\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.790\nthen we'll go to lunch and actually we're\ngonna move on for a couple hours and\n\n291\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.470\nlet this thing stew in the background.\n\n292\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.930\nNow, again, it doesn't take that\nlong with a lot of modules.\n\n293\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.935\nI have the lowest end model you can get.\n\n294\n00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:45.100\nThe 5506.\n\n295\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.160\nActs right, it's a great product.\n\n296\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.320\nGreat for slow hosts, small offices, but\n\n297\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.190\nanything you do is going\nto be a little bit slower.\n\n298\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.180\nIt's just processing so for\nus you can't be in any hurry.\n\n299\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.055\nOne of the things I teach my students\nin class first I'm Ping the after thing\n\n300\n00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.353\nserver, is you can't be in\na hurry with this product.\n\n301\n00:14:01.353 --> 00:14:02.855\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you're always sitting there\n\n302\n00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:07.155\nwith the policies and all this, pushing\nthis forward, and it takes time, right?\n\n303\n00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:09.425\nSo at this point here,\nI ping the after thing server,\n\n304\n00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:14.775\nI make sure that the system file is on\nthe fpt server, and again do you get this?\n\n305\n00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.850\nWhen you buy the upgrade,\nit will be in your c c o account.\n\n306\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.260\nRight you're going to be able to get.\n\n307\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.190\nYou're going to get the system file,\nyou're going to get the boot file and\n\n308\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.890\nyou're going to put these on here.\n\n309\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.200\nOk, so now we're going to\ngo on to my disc command.\n\n310\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.060\nSee if you all can see this.\n\n311\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.490\nNow notice on system install at\nconfigure I put the I P address in and\n\n312\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.730\nthe system file Okay, so\nobviously these have to match.\n\n313\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.770\nOkay, so I'm going to wait, come here, and\nwe'll say, yes so in 20 minutes, what I'll\n\n314\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:49.300\ndo is I'll just go finish the other box,\nadd it into a device, and we'll go lunch.\n\n315\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.460\nRight, does that sound good?\n\n316\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.269\nSo I'm actually going to\njust copy this command here.\n\n317\n00:14:53.777 --> 00:14:55.216\nAnd I'm gonna paste this in.\n\n318\n00:15:02.948 --> 00:15:04.625\nAnd notice it's out there thinking\nit's trying to go to the FTP server,\n\n319\n00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:05.460\nit's gonna take a couple seconds.\n\n320\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.540\nIt's verifying, it's gonna come back and\nsay downloading, so\n\n321\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.860\nwe're gonna let that run for\na couple minutes.\n\n322\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.330\nI don't think this part takes very much,\nbut\n\n323\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.000\nwhen we come here It's gonna extract and\nspend a couple minutes and say yes.\n\n324\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.140\nIn this case, here,\nlet's go ahead and let that download.\n\n325\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.940\nI think it's was 300 MB.\n\n326\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.700\nThat's why we don't wanna use TP.\n\n327\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.870\nIt's about 300 MB or something like this.\n\n328\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.750\nIn this case, here,\nnotice I'm at this greater than sign.\n\n329\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.540\nThat's my SFR module,\nand would run commands.\n\n330\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.810\nI could do a question mark, and\nwe can see that we wouldn't do much here.\n\n331\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.990\nI can configure stuff, so,\nlet's say I screwed up my IP address.\n\n332\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.980\nI can actually reconfigure it\nfrom the Command Line here but\n\n333\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.250\nwe don't spend a lot of time\nhere on the Command Line.\n\n334\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.360\nAt this point here, I've got it in here,\nI'm just gonna say configure manager so\n\n335\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.800\nI'm saying what manager is this\nI'm a managed device in a sensor,\n\n336\n00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.962\nwho's my manager?\n\n337\n00:15:56.962 --> 00:16:01.629\nAdd 10.11 10.15,\nthat's my manager, but wait.\n\n338\n00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:03.855\nI need to put in that password that\nwe saw when I said add device, so\n\n339\n00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:05.004\nnow I'm going to add something.\n\n340\n00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:05.628\nI'm going to say Cisco.\n\n341\n00:16:05.628 --> 00:16:08.602\nAll right, and\nI'm just going to do this, and\n\n342\n00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:11.212\nI'm Pretty much done with this box now.\n\n343\n00:16:11.212 --> 00:16:16.132\nThere's a couple of other commands we'll\ngo through like I wanna show service\n\n344\n00:16:16.132 --> 00:16:21.216\npolicy to see packets what are coming in\nthat module and out that module and so on.\n\n345\n00:16:21.216 --> 00:16:24.000\nOkay, so\nyou just give us another second here.\n\n346\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.490\nIt takes about a minute for\nthis to go through,\n\n347\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.839\nand we're about 30 seconds into that.\n\n348\n00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:29.497\nAnd once we do this we'll\nadd it to the device and\n\n349\n00:16:29.497 --> 00:16:31.720\nthen we'll finish up this module.\n\n350\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.877\nSo it says show managers,\nagain it takes a second to show up, and\n\n351\n00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:38.338\nwe can see that it's not registered\nto a fireside management center.\n\n352\n00:16:38.338 --> 00:16:41.903\nSo it says pending but\nit shows my password too so\n\n353\n00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:46.804\nnow I can go out to there and\nnotice I'm going to let this go guys and\n\n354\n00:16:46.804 --> 00:16:50.070\nuninstall and then we end up here, right?\n\n355\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.120\nIt just takes longer to\nget both are the same.\n\n356\n00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.857\nIf I had a 5585, we'd be done.\n\n357\n00:16:53.857 --> 00:16:58.272\nThere actually that's hardware but lets\nsay a 5555 I'd be done with all of this\n\n358\n00:16:58.272 --> 00:17:01.618\nalready but I've created my system\npolicy my health policy and\n\n359\n00:17:01.618 --> 00:17:04.630\nI've created my licenses so\nI'm ready to add a device.\n\n360\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.711\nNow the one thing I haven't done\nis created the policies and\n\n361\n00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:11.223\ntypically a lot of times I'll create\npolicies before I start out but\n\n362\n00:17:11.223 --> 00:17:15.065\nnone of this It, it, not, this is just\nmy rule of thumb on how I do things.\n\n363\n00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:17.390\nIt does not have to be yours, right?\n\n364\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.110\nSo, in this case here I'm\ngonna add a device and\n\n365\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.002\nI can create my system file health policy\nor use the ones that are already there.\n\n366\n00:17:22.002 --> 00:17:24.550\nThey have preconfigured ones.\n\n367\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.380\nAnd, but the one thing you really do wanna\nconsider is I want to license my FNC's\n\n368\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.250\nbefore I get here right?\n\n369\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.208\nI'm just gonna say, Add Device, and\n\n370\n00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:36.297\nmy IP address of my device, 20.2.\n\n371\n00:17:36.297 --> 00:17:42.594\nAnd the key that I put in at the end,\nso if I come back over here,\n\n372\n00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:47.950\nI can see right there,\nthis is my FMC's IP address.\n\n373\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.590\nAnd this is the password.\n\n374\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.410\nAnd then I'll come back over here and\nput in the Asus management I.P.\n\n375\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.070\naddress I put on the module\nnot on the management port.\n\n376\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.120\nNotice this, I'm gonna hit protection.\n\n377\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.800\nI'm gonna add all my licenses in there.\n\n378\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.249\nAnd then I hit advance and say, now,\nI want it with transfer packets.\n\n379\n00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:12.607\nDefinitely.\n\n380\n00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:13.920\nWe talked about that.\n\n381\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.610\nBut, you can unclick that.\n\n382\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:16.360\nUnique NAT ID.\n\n383\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.530\nBut notice, I can't register it.\n\n384\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.450\nHow come?\n\n385\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.110\nCause I need an access control policy.\n\n386\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.280\nNotice I don't have any\nconfigured in here.\n\n387\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.970\nAnd, this is why, a lot of times, I'll\ngo and configure my policies right away.\n\n388\n00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.518\nI have my file policy I have\nmy IPS policy I put them in my\n\n389\n00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:32.702\naccess control policy now it says\nI don't know cons ACP down here.\n\n390\n00:18:32.702 --> 00:18:34.816\nI can figure this I'm gone and\nthis thing's up and running,\n\n391\n00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:35.736\nright on the dot, right?\n\n392\n00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:39.068\nAnd that's kind of just my rule,\nsomebody you can do whatever you want.\n\n393\n00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:47.010\nThis takes a couple minutes here.\n\n394\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.458\nSo as this is adding here, let's go back\nand look at the one we're banking on,\n\n395\n00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:52.308\nthe install that we're upgrading here.\n\n396\n00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:54.090\nIt still say's extracting.\n\n397\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.890\nAgain this is a 5506, this one is\nthe slowest one I've ever seen.\n\n398\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.540\nAgain, great for classroom demos and\nvery small offices.\n\n399\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.520\nBut you can't be in a hurry and\nbe on something like this,\n\n400\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.780\nthis should have, already been done so\nwe're on this guy here.\n\n401\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.919\nLet's take a look here so I'm going to\nsay, upgrade and say show managers.\n\n402\n00:19:15.104 --> 00:19:18.271\n>> Yeah, I think the lesson of this story\nhere is if you are gonna go with the 5506\n\n403\n00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:20.779\njust buy it with if the fire power [LAUGH]\n>> Yes but even so\n\n404\n00:19:20.779 --> 00:19:24.420\nwe can see that it's\nstill pending here right?\n\n405\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.170\nIt hasn't gone in.\n\n406\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.450\nI don't think I made a mistake on the\nconfiguration we'll find out here right?\n\n407\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.200\nIt should have actually added it by now so\nI think it's having a problem.\n\n408\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.740\n>> So right now it's actually reaching\nover the network trying to talk to\n\n409\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.530\nthat device.\n\n410\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.933\nAnd problems here could be network\nconnectivity, could be incorrect password,\n\n411\n00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:43.242\ncould be anything like that could stop it?\n\n412\n00:19:43.242 --> 00:19:45.819\n>> The incorrect password for sure.\n\n413\n00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.900\nThe app can't get to the IP address.\n\n414\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.058\nI didn't configure the manager, the\ncorrect IP address for the manager on 10,\n\n415\n00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:52.893\n11, 10, 15.\n\n416\n00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:53.532\nSo that was right.\n\n417\n00:19:53.532 --> 00:19:56.540\n10, 11, 10, 20 was the ASA.\n\n418\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.910\nSo this seems to be, I think we're\nhaving a problem here, maybe.\n\n419\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.380\nWe'll see here unless\nthis says registered now.\n\n420\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.865\nIt always shows up here\nfirst as registered, so\n\n421\n00:20:04.865 --> 00:20:08.727\nwe'll see if it's working and then we\ngo back and it kinda shows up there.\n\n422\n00:20:08.727 --> 00:20:13.870\nAgain guys,\nthis is because I have slow products.\n\n423\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.793\nI spent as little money as possible.\n\n424\n00:20:15.793 --> 00:20:17.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so that was my goal.\n\n425\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.130\nHow can I do this with no money?\n\n426\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.190\nSo I spend as little as possible,\nand these are the result of that.\n\n427\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.200\nIf I had spend a lot more money,\nand see now it says completed.\n\n428\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.250\nAnd so now we'll go to the other one,\nand this guy's all ready good.\n\n429\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.260\nAnd the other one is just refreshing\nthe screen at this point.\n\n430\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.370\nSo it's working, every body is happy,\n\n431\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.830\nit's gonna show up in there, and\nnow we can go and configure it.\n\n432\n00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.610\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwhen we get back.\n\n433\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:44.310\nFrom one tier, we'll go ahead and start\nconfiguring system policy to help policy.\n\n434\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.490\nThese guys are still baking over\nhere right, well, let him install.\n\n435\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.890\nWe'll create our system policy,\nour health policy.\n\n436\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.953\nWe'll go thru some of that stuff and\nwe'll apply it to any device and\n\n437\n00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:55.008\nthen we'll start creating other policies.\n\n438\n00:20:55.008 --> 00:20:57.236\nHopefully, that's we're\nwe'll end up today.\n\n439\n00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:58.690\nHow can I forget.\n\n440\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.751\nAll three policies done that I want today\nbut I think we can get it pretty close.\n\n441\n00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:03.808\nLet's go see if our device\nis in there before we go.\n\n442\n00:21:03.808 --> 00:21:07.260\n[LAUGH] It's not, but it will.\n\n443\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.990\nThere it is.\nIt's completely reloading.\n\n444\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.661\nAgain, slow products,\nslow load defense center.\n\n445\n00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:12.865\n>> Excellent.\n\n446\n00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:16.208\nWell, so in this episode, we did get\na chance to see how to get the Sourcefire\n\n447\n00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:19.254\nmodule installed, SFR module if\nyou didn't have it there already.\n\n448\n00:21:19.254 --> 00:21:21.600\nWe also say what it was like\nif it was already there.\n\n449\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.131\nWe say the basic configuration, right?\n\n450\n00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:27.740\nThis, just the CLI pieces we\nneeded to get to the UI side.\n\n451\n00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.784\nNow that it's added in,\n\n452\n00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:31.832\nwe'll manage the rest of it all right\nthere from the management center.\n\n453\n00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.120\nLife becomes a lot easier.\n\n454\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.830\nSo, in our next section of\nepisodes we're basically going\n\n455\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.260\nto be tackling the configuration\nthat we do from the web UI, which is\n\n456\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.750\nwhat we're going to live in from day to\nday as we work with the devices, right?\n\n457\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.290\nWhat we just saw was kind of day one, now\nwe're going to see day two through the end\n\n458\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.690\nof life, beyond that so this is a pretty\ngood spot to wrap this episode up.\n\n459\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.562\nDefinitely stay tuned for the rest of the\nconfiguration episodes that are coming up.\n\n460\n00:21:54.562 --> 00:21:56.151\nWe're gonna get into some\nof the really exciting\n\n461\n00:21:56.151 --> 00:21:57.514\nthings especially with those policies.\n\n462\n00:21:57.514 --> 00:22:00.382\n>> Agree, stick around cuz we're\nfinally getting to the fun part, right?\n\n463\n00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:01.214\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n464\n00:22:01.214 --> 00:22:04.890\nI have some I was checking my emails\nwhile we were at break right there.\n\n465\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.006\nI had some other customers\nwhere I've been working for\n\n466\n00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:09.446\ndays to get to this point because\nthey gotta get the ftp server.\n\n467\n00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:10.960\nThey gotta get the licenses.\n\n468\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.706\nLicensing can take a day.\n\n469\n00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:15.780\nAll of this is very time consuming,\nunderstand, to get to this point and for\n\n470\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.701\nus to get to this point was not easy.\n\n471\n00:22:17.701 --> 00:22:20.930\nAll right, so once we get here now\nwe can start our configuration so\n\n472\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.862\nplease come back.\n\n473\n00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:25.182\n>> Awesome, alright well, ladies and\ngentlemen I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n474\n00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:28.862\nI know I did and we look forward to seeing\nyou in the next episode, but for now\n\n475\n00:22:28.862 --> 00:22:31.823\nsigning off for IT pro tv, I'm Don Pizzet\n>> And I'm Todd Lamely\n\n476\n00:22:31.823 --> 00:22:32.903\n>> And we'll see ya then.\n\n477\n00:22:32.903 --> 00:22:39.200\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.733\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:22.695\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n5\n00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.367\nWe're gonna be diving right back into it.\n\n6\n00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:28.237\nIn our previous episodes, we got\na chance to see what FirePOWER was, and\n\n7\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.915\nhow to kind of get it installed and\nup and running.\n\n8\n00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.811\nBut now that it's up and running, it's\nprobably important that we do something\n\n9\n00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.953\nwith it since we've paid all\nthe money to get to this point.\n\n10\n00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.041\nSo, to help us see what that something is,\n\n11\n00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.161\nwe've got Todd Lammle back in the studio\nwith us, and Todd, thanks for being here.\n\n12\n00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.428\nLet's see what we can do.\n\n13\n00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:44.911\n>> All right, let's do this.\n\n14\n00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.505\nSo let's talk about where we left off,\nif you watched the previous ones.\n\n15\n00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.618\nIf not, you're coming in here,\nthat's fine.\n\n16\n00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:55.463\nBut the deal is, is one of\nthe things that we left, and Don and\n\n17\n00:00:55.463 --> 00:00:58.340\nI went out and had something to eat.\n\n18\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.571\nWe were doing the install\non the first one, so\n\n19\n00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.403\nthis was a new way of saying\nwe were upgrading it, right?\n\n20\n00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:07.904\nThis one over here that we're working on,\nand let me do the I think, or whatever.\n\n21\n00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:11.260\nThis one over here,\nwe pretended to buy with the module and\n\n22\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.740\nwe did it how you'd probably see it.\n\n23\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.321\nBut if you were upgrading over here, what\nhappened is I had to start it over when we\n\n24\n00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.692\ngot back because it sat there for\nawhile and says, it waited 20 minutes and\n\n25\n00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:21.869\nthen says,\ndo you want to continue the upgrade?\n\n26\n00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.750\nWell, of course you do, and I didn't press\nEnter and it said, well I guess you don't,\n\n27\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.550\nand timed us out.\n\n28\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.530\nAll right, so here's where we're at,\nso we've got this guy here,\n\n29\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.716\nthis guy's upgrading again and you gotta\nremind me to come back to that guy so\n\n30\n00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.252\nwe can press Yes.\n\n31\n00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.274\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, nonetheless, and\n\n32\n00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:36.340\nhe's in our FireSIGHT management center,\nour defense center, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.006\nSo here he is,\nnotice we have our licenses.\n\n34\n00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:40.810\nRemember I put those on so, again,\n\n35\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.068\nwe're gonna go through that right\nnow as part of this over here.\n\n36\n00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:46.113\nWe're gonna go through the system and\nhealth policies, and\n\n37\n00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:47.684\nwe're gonna take a look\nat licensing as well.\n\n38\n00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.940\nBut notice I had licensed my\ndefense centers ahead of time.\n\n39\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.758\nAnd then I was able, when I added\nthe device I just clicked it all and said,\n\n40\n00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:54.820\nyes, add this one in here.\n\n41\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.580\nRemember, if I remove this guy and I trash\nthis guy the licenses stay on the defense\n\n42\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.220\ncenter, they don't stay with the device.\n\n43\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.919\nNotice I don't have a health or\nsystem policy,\n\n44\n00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.580\nI don't even have to have one but we will.\n\n45\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.731\nAnd there's the default access\ncontrol that as we take a look at it,\n\n46\n00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.665\nwhen we get to that, probably tomorrow,\n\n47\n00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:13.200\n[COUGH] we'll see that this really doesn't\ndo anything but we want to change that.\n\n48\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.963\nSo we're here, this is good, and\nwhat we really wanna do, and\n\n49\n00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:19.261\nmost of the time I do do this, I create\nthe system policy and health policy.\n\n50\n00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.847\nAnd when I'm putting the device in\nthen I come in there and apply them.\n\n51\n00:02:21.847 --> 00:02:24.721\nBut in this case here it doesn't matter,\nI'll do it now.\n\n52\n00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.640\nAnd once I create it, and\n\n53\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.700\nwe'll add more devices into this tomorrow,\nI'll just add those same policies in here.\n\n54\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.323\nSo we'll come over here and\nlet's just go through these.\n\n55\n00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.926\nNow, I'm not gonna go through all of\nthese because that would take an hour or\n\n56\n00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.305\nmore and\nthey're not all really that important.\n\n57\n00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:40.533\nSo you have to go through and look at\nthem and figure out what you need for\n\n58\n00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:41.260\nyour network.\n\n59\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.440\nA lot of the default stuff that's on,\na lot of people just leave these.\n\n60\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.820\nAll right, but the health monitor,\n\n61\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.930\nlet's take a look at,\nthere is some interesting stuff in here.\n\n62\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.830\nWe'll take a look at each one of these and\nwhat they are.\n\n63\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.770\nAnd then we'll come over to the system\npolicy and the system licensing.\n\n64\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.254\nAll right, so we should be able\nto get this done in one module,\n\n65\n00:02:56.254 --> 00:02:58.400\nsession, whatever you guys call it.\n\n66\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.572\nAll right, so we can see my\nstatuses like I'm pretty happy\n\n67\n00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:05.850\n[LAUGH] some of it's been 50% disabled,\nI'm not completely there.\n\n68\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.210\nA lot of times you'll see these errors and\nthis guy turns red up here, so\n\n69\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.060\nyou're gonna come in here,\nwhat's going on?\n\n70\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.934\nIt could be something simple, a lot of\ntimes if you have high availability for\n\n71\n00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:18.871\nexample, the secondary guy's not sending\nany data out it's interface and so\n\n72\n00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:20.555\nyou get a health warning on that.\n\n73\n00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.755\nAnd that's the point of contention for\n\n74\n00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:25.361\nsome people too with\nthis high availability.\n\n75\n00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.359\nIs, not only do you have to buy the full\nlicense for it and you're not using it,\n\n76\n00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.280\nit sends out a health alert because\nyou're not sending any data through it.\n\n77\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.968\nSo I go and I either blacklist it or\nturn off that link access or\n\n78\n00:03:33.968 --> 00:03:35.776\nsomething through the health monitor.\n\n79\n00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:39.388\nThat's a per customer basis.\n\n80\n00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:42.841\nNow I'm gonna click on this round\nthing which is both my appliance and\n\n81\n00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:44.455\nmy defense center in this case.\n\n82\n00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:47.600\nAnd we're not completely configured so\nwe're seeing some of this stuff here.\n\n83\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.170\nBut notice we come down here we get more\ninformation what it's looking at and so\n\n84\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.027\non and [LAUGH] I'm gonna\nclick on this appliance here.\n\n85\n00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:00.525\n[LAUGH] So,\nwe're gonna take a look here and\n\n86\n00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:04.130\nsee if I can bring that back up,\nthere we go.\n\n87\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.175\nI'm having some issues with my device\nright here, it's saying it's disabled and\n\n88\n00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:10.440\neverything's disabled, that's awesome.\n\n89\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.831\nAt this point here,\nwe'll come in and troubleshoot this.\n\n90\n00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:14.448\nBut a lot of times I'll talk to Cisco and\n\n91\n00:04:14.448 --> 00:04:17.976\nI'm working on some device and I'll come\nin here and they'll say hey, generate some\n\n92\n00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:20.927\ntroubleshooting files on your managed\ndevice or your defense center.\n\n93\n00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.133\nAnd this is where you'd come to do it and\ngenerate these files.\n\n94\n00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.973\nI'm not gonna do this, I'll click on this,\nbut I'm not gonna go ahead and\n\n95\n00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:27.382\ndo this it'd take about a half hour.\n\n96\n00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:29.936\nSo the fact is you can click on this and\nchoose them.\n\n97\n00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.724\nAnd I would only do this if Cisco's\nasking you to, it's kind of convoluted,\n\n98\n00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:35.602\nbut this is where you would go to do it.\n\n99\n00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:40.040\nNotice I got a health event so, for\nsome reason I lost a heartbeat or\n\n100\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.428\nsomething, it's kinda unhappy.\n\n101\n00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:44.541\nSeems to be responding.\n\n102\n00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:47.184\nI'm gonna just show network, show manager,\n\n103\n00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:50.470\nthere's a couple few\ncommands I can run on here.\n\n104\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.660\nBut right now my device\nis a little unhappy.\n\n105\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.024\nAll right, so I click and\nnotice that my health has turned yellow,\n\n106\n00:04:56.024 --> 00:05:00.046\nit was green up here and when I go to the\ndevice it's green, but I clicked on it and\n\n107\n00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:01.026\nit turned yellow.\n\n108\n00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:03.556\nIt's like, hey you clicked on me,\nbut really I come down here and\n\n109\n00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:04.760\nthis isn't a bad thing to see.\n\n110\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.160\nWhen you get something like this\nyou're like what's going on here?\n\n111\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.580\nAnd basically if I see something\nlike this it's like my managed\n\n112\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.910\ndevice can't get to the Internet, it's not\nnecessarily a bad thing or a wrong thing.\n\n113\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.190\nMaybe there's something with\nthe dynamic analysis cloud, or\n\n114\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.960\nmaybe it's my Internet connection.\n\n115\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.391\nNonetheless, when I go to devices here,\nI can see that it's healthy so\n\n116\n00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:24.207\nI'm talking from my managed\ndevice to my defense center.\n\n117\n00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:25.242\nSo it's not me, right, so\n\n118\n00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:28.438\nthere's something from my managed device\nto the Internet is what it's telling me.\n\n119\n00:05:28.438 --> 00:05:31.982\nBut I'll click on this guy here and,\nwe'll see, brings this up, and\n\n120\n00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:33.738\nI'll click on my appliance here.\n\n121\n00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:38.034\nAnd at this point here, I would go here\nbecause I can now generate troubleshooting\n\n122\n00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:39.728\nfiles and see what's going on.\n\n123\n00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:42.500\nSo we can see that most of it's normal.\n\n124\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.734\nAnd as I'm building this,\nthis isn't wrong to see.\n\n125\n00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.086\nNow, if this warning keeps up,\nwhen I can't see the now,\n\n126\n00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:49.646\nit's something I'll probably look into.\n\n127\n00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:51.922\nBut sometimes when you get that,\nI've seen that before,\n\n128\n00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:55.260\nand just give it a couple minutes it will\nre-sync up, right, something like that.\n\n129\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.560\nIn this case here you might wanna\ngenerate troubleshooting files.\n\n130\n00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.050\nI wouldn't do this unless Cisco asks you,\n\n131\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.380\nthey're not gonna be\nreally helpful to you.\n\n132\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.270\nBut you generate this, it takes them\nquite a while to download these,\n\n133\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.850\nso I'm not gonna do that on the screen.\n\n134\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.360\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at the health policy now.\n\n135\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.350\nAnd you don't have to do anything.\n\n136\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.194\nYou can just apply\nthe existing one that's there.\n\n137\n00:06:14.194 --> 00:06:17.218\nNotice I have a couple in here, actually\nI'm gonna delete these out of here\n\n138\n00:06:17.218 --> 00:06:19.047\nbecause we'll create new ones, all right.\n\n139\n00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:23.777\nNotice it was on one device it said and\nso,\n\n140\n00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:27.049\nI'll just delete these out of\nhere from when I was working, but\n\n141\n00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:29.992\nthere's one in here built in and\nI can just use this one.\n\n142\n00:06:29.992 --> 00:06:31.454\nSo this case here I'm\nnot gonna use this one.\n\n143\n00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.578\nI'll just say Create Policy and\nwe'll go through.\n\n144\n00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:36.533\nI'm not gonna, again, go through all\nof these, there's a lot of them.\n\n145\n00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:39.138\nThere's a lot of detail you\ncan get on the help screen and\n\n146\n00:06:39.138 --> 00:06:41.070\nfigure out do you really want to do this?\n\n147\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.291\nSo Copy Policy, New Policy Name is,\nI'm gonna say Pod2 Health Policy, right.\n\n148\n00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:51.224\n>> Now Todd, while your defining that I\nknow you mentioned with a access control\n\n149\n00:06:51.224 --> 00:06:54.566\npolicy, you can only have one\naccess control policy per device.\n\n150\n00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:56.440\nAre the health policies the same way?\n\n151\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.858\n>> Yes, you only have one per device but\nI can create one for each device.\n\n152\n00:06:59.858 --> 00:07:02.400\nYou notice I had a couple in here,\none for each different device.\n\n153\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.313\nTypically I just create one for\na defense center.\n\n154\n00:07:04.313 --> 00:07:07.943\nIt's very normal, just create one and\napply it to all your devices,\n\n155\n00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:10.141\nthe system policy and the health policy.\n\n156\n00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:14.468\nTypically, I'm not saying you have to do\nthat, but you create one and you put it on\n\n157\n00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:18.639\nall devices cuz you have like a general\noverview configuration here, right?\n\n158\n00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.659\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this, notice we have it.\n\n159\n00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:24.178\nBut now once we edit this,\nI can click this green check box and\n\n160\n00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:25.982\nthis will push the policy out.\n\n161\n00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:29.912\nSo this is a separate policy we're gonna\npush and it only takes a minute or so,\n\n162\n00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:30.945\nit's not that big.\n\n163\n00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:34.492\nSo but in this case here,\nlet's go ahead and edit it real quick,\n\n164\n00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:37.725\nmaybe we change nothing but\nlet's take a quick look at it.\n\n165\n00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:38.863\nOkay, so I named it that.\n\n166\n00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:44.853\nOne of the things is, now this\nisn't turning on and off services.\n\n167\n00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:47.639\nThis is telling me if I had\na problem with those services.\n\n168\n00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.411\nSo AMP, do I have it on?\n\n169\n00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:52.575\nYes, and if there's a problem\nwith it I want to know.\n\n170\n00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:56.882\nAppliance Heartbeat, this might\nbe something I leave on for sure.\n\n171\n00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:59.664\nNow remember I talked earlier\nabout the Application Bypass,\n\n172\n00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:02.339\nthat's if A file comes in and\nit hits a certain snort rule and\n\n173\n00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:06.100\nthe snort rule is trying to process it but\nit takes more than three seconds.\n\n174\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.970\nYou can turn this on where it says,\nlet the file through and\n\n175\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.940\ndisable that snort rule for five minutes,\nwe'll see that in the system policy and\n\n176\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.420\nwe'll let that file, that particular file\nthat's in that snort rule through and\n\n177\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.120\nit'll try to get that snort rule\nto To analyze this quicker, right.\n\n178\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.247\nAnd this is saying, yes we are gonna\nmonitor for doing that and\n\n179\n00:08:24.247 --> 00:08:25.461\nthat's on by default.\n\n180\n00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.360\nSo we will come down here and\nyou can see everything on here.\n\n181\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.376\nNow disk usage and stuff, and you can set\nthis up so you can even have it email you\n\n182\n00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:38.252\nand say, hey your disk is full your memory\nis running out and you can send it.\n\n183\n00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:42.355\nSo we'll come up here and you can send\nan alert and wether SNMP, sys log,\n\n184\n00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.877\nor email and tells you,\nhey this is going on with your device.\n\n185\n00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:48.961\nYou might want to be careful on setting up\nyour email with too many of these though.\n\n186\n00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:53.450\nAll right or your tax anyways,\nhere's one of them.\n\n187\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.680\nFor that, you might wanna do\nis the fire site because,\n\n188\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.470\nremember this is your host users and\napplications.\n\n189\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.270\nWhat do I have on my network?\n\n190\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:08.790\nSo this is telling me, how many users,\nand hosts, applications, and so on.\n\n191\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.666\nAnd typically a 50,000 or\n\n192\n00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:15.770\n500,000 depending on the defense\ncenter you have is what your limit is.\n\n193\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.700\nSo this is telling you hey, my limit\nis being reached, my fire site is busy.\n\n194\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.620\nNow, typically this happens if you\ndon't configure your network discovery\n\n195\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.710\npolicy correct and you're gathering\ninformation on hosts on the Internet.\n\n196\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.910\nSo we'll take a look at that and\n\n197\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.372\nsee how quickly this can fill\nup if we're not careful.\n\n198\n00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:33.810\nAll right, so you have hardware logs,\nhealth monitor process.\n\n199\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.760\nNow on the interface it has one\nof them that I did change because\n\n200\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.070\nbasically if I've high availability,\n\n201\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.910\nthis is telling me, hey you have\nthis problem with this interface.\n\n202\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.586\nIt's not, if it's not receiving traffic,\nwell, on your standby machine,\n\n203\n00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:46.544\nit's not going to.\n\n204\n00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.760\nSo you're going to get a health alert, so\nyou can come in here and turn this off.\n\n205\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.150\nThe problem with that is if it fails over,\nyou're not gonna get that, warning right?\n\n206\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.590\nOkay, so that's one way to do it.\n\n207\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.850\nSo come down here you got time\nsynchronization status, again, this\n\n208\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.180\nis telling me if I have problems or not\nand in this case it's not turning on and\n\n209\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.630\noff so just go through and\ntake a look at these.\n\n210\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.900\nThey're pretty, security intelligence,\nlet me explain that.\n\n211\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.707\nThat is you're white and black list and\nobviously we want this on and\n\n212\n00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:14.909\nwe want to monitor this and get alerts\nif we're hitting something on our black\n\n213\n00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:16.753\nlist or our white list or whatever, right?\n\n214\n00:10:16.753 --> 00:10:18.720\nAnd we'll talk more about that.\n\n215\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.930\nBut let me just save this, really I\ndon't think I made any changes actually.\n\n216\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.750\nBut I'll save that, and notice I've\ngot this here and I can go ahead and\n\n217\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.961\nset up a alerts, and I'll show you this in\njust a minute, and I can push that out.\n\n218\n00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:32.817\nBut before we do that, I can come in here\nand look at these health events, and\n\n219\n00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:34.587\nsee you know hey, what happened?\n\n220\n00:10:34.587 --> 00:10:35.627\nWhy am I getting this?\n\n221\n00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:37.794\nWhat's going on and is it fixed?\n\n222\n00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:39.420\nAnd what do I need to do?\n\n223\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.586\nAnd notice these aren't really\nnecessarily bad, right?\n\n224\n00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:46.668\nI don't think anything here is bad,\nprocess is running correctly, so\n\n225\n00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:51.363\nwe can go and see our events If something\nis taken out for maintenance or whatever,\n\n226\n00:10:51.363 --> 00:10:53.419\nI can blacklist that, the device.\n\n227\n00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:58.370\nAnd then I can interesting enough here,\nso I found this one kind of fascinating.\n\n228\n00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.870\nI don't spend a lot of time on this,\nbut you can come in here and you can\n\n229\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.250\ncreate an alert and say,\nTodd's try to here Todd's Alert.\n\n230\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.636\nAnd I can sit there and\nsay if it's critical and my,\n\n231\n00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:19.002\nI don't know, the host limit is this.\n\n232\n00:11:19.002 --> 00:11:21.550\nNow the alerts I have in\nhere are configured to here.\n\n233\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.980\nSo I can come in here, if I clicked on\nthis it would say Email SNP or syslog.\n\n234\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.570\nIn this case, I already configured\na syslog, or nothing here.\n\n235\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.270\nSo I say if it's critical and\nit's fireside host limits, and\n\n236\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.350\nit's a syslog, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and save this one.\n\n237\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.150\nI could have it again,\nset up and email it.\n\n238\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.961\nAnd, so we'll see this here.\n\n239\n00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.651\nOkay, and there's Todd's alert right\nthere, and then I'm gonna say go ahead and\n\n240\n00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:48.670\nload that, so\nwhenever that happens I'll get a syslog.\n\n241\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.057\nTypically you do something like thing that\nyou're having a problem and you want to be\n\n242\n00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:54.980\nemailed about it, and that's why you\nwould set something like this up.\n\n243\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.630\nIt's just kind of a cool thing to set up.\n\n244\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.961\nSo let's go back here\nto the health policy.\n\n245\n00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:02.836\nAnd, notice I didn't spend\na lot of time here again.\n\n246\n00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:05.255\nGo through here,\nspend some time, do it once and\n\n247\n00:12:05.255 --> 00:12:07.210\nthen send it out to all of your devices.\n\n248\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.918\nOkay, so I'm gonna go ahead and click this\ncheckbox, I'm gonna let that thing go.\n\n249\n00:12:10.918 --> 00:12:14.377\nGive it a second here.\n\n250\n00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:15.774\n>> Now, when you activate this,\n\n251\n00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:18.586\nwe never really told it like what\ndevice to send it to, right?\n\n252\n00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:19.252\n>> Right.\nSo, and\n\n253\n00:12:19.252 --> 00:12:20.711\nthat's what it just brought up, right?\n\n254\n00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.086\nSo when I clicked on that it says,\nwell who do you want to send it to?\n\n255\n00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:27.087\nAnd in this case here,\nI'm going to zoom on this.\n\n256\n00:12:27.087 --> 00:12:30.259\nYou'll notice it said, well here's\nyour defence center, and this is it,\n\n257\n00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.181\ndo you want it on both, I'm like,\nyes, of course, I want or show me,\n\n258\n00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:35.086\nhey you're only on one\nappliance out of two.\n\n259\n00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:39.182\nIn this case here, when we add a new\ndevice in here, managed device tomorrow,\n\n260\n00:12:39.182 --> 00:12:41.910\nwe can come in here and\njust add it to that guy here.\n\n261\n00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and apply this here.\n\n262\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.060\nAnd then as we do that,\n\n263\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.050\nit's gonna bring up something\ncalled the Task Status Monitor,\n\n264\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.390\nand we're gonna watch that.\n\n265\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.330\nAnd we can get that through system\nmonitoring task status as well.\n\n266\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.162\nBut notice this right here, and this is\ngonna tell me hey, here's what's going on,\n\n267\n00:12:57.162 --> 00:12:59.983\nlet me see if I can open this bigger,\nhere's what's going on,\n\n268\n00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:03.794\nyou've had 11 completed so notice I've\ngot all this stuff that has been running.\n\n269\n00:13:03.794 --> 00:13:07.110\nI've got one running and\nnotice here it is running.\n\n270\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.796\nNow I can remove completed jobs or\nremove failed jobs so let's go ahead and\n\n271\n00:13:10.796 --> 00:13:13.003\ndo that because this\nthing gets kinda full.\n\n272\n00:13:13.003 --> 00:13:14.336\nSo let me remove this completed jobs.\n\n273\n00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.502\nNow all I have is this guy here.\n\n274\n00:13:16.502 --> 00:13:20.209\nAs we go along we'll start seeing more\ninformation here from network discovery\n\n275\n00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:23.045\nand so on, getting errors, and\nI'll explain those to you.\n\n276\n00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:24.586\nSo that's running in the background.\n\n277\n00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:28.419\nLet's go head and just let that run,\nand let's go to the system policy.\n\n278\n00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:31.707\nBefore we do that, let's go ahead and\nstart over here with system tools, and\n\n279\n00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:34.950\nwe're gonna come back to this later,\nprobably on the last day.\n\n280\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.460\nBackup, restore, scheduling so\n\n281\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.400\nI can schedule backups, reports,\nupdating IPS rules and so on.\n\n282\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.440\nAnd I can import, export,\nconfigure policies and so on.\n\n283\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.720\nUnder monitoring, now the audit\nIs basically Bob was logged in,\n\n284\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.070\nwhat did he do, right?\n\n285\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.620\nAnd this is gonna show us what he did.\n\n286\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.395\nAnd then here's my, there's the syslog and\nhow to configure the syslog.\n\n287\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.520\nAnd then let's talk about licenses\nbefore we get to the system policy.\n\n288\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.850\nNotice we're kind of moving left to right,\nand\n\n289\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.220\nI'm gonna come back to this updates one\nbecause it's a longer conversation.\n\n290\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.700\nNotice I'm under licensing, it says hey,\n\n291\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.890\nyou've got two licenses configured\non here I don't have a VPN license,\n\n292\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.880\nbecause we're on an NASA, and\nit has it's own VPN, right.\n\n293\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.293\nIf I was on an actual client's,\nthen it would have its VPN license.\n\n294\n00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:21.419\nAnd here, it says one is used, right?\n\n295\n00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:23.461\nNow my fire sight in\nthis case here is 50,000.\n\n296\n00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:26.044\n50,000 users, 50,000 hosts.\n\n297\n00:14:26.044 --> 00:14:27.778\nRight, and this will get full,\n\n298\n00:14:27.778 --> 00:14:31.001\nwe'll see this later if we stay\nconnected to the internet.\n\n299\n00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:34.480\nIt'll start collecting information\non hosts for you out there.\n\n300\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.090\nAnd this says,\nI have got valid license, two of each,\n\n301\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.200\nI've got protection and control.\n\n302\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.211\nThis is my IPS license,\nand the I've got URL and.\n\n303\n00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:44.294\nAnd here's my fire site.\n\n304\n00:14:44.294 --> 00:14:47.169\nThis is the license that I\nput on my defense center.\n\n305\n00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:50.700\nSo, I license my defense center and\nthat's my fire site license, right?\n\n306\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.260\nSo, you license your defense center and\n\n307\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.920\nthen you license your developed\nmanaged devices as well.\n\n308\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.700\nNotice that these expire, and that\nthis one never, you know, the IPS one,\n\n309\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.470\nwhen you buy that one,\nthat's not terms, so that one's good.\n\n310\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.252\nNow, here's the key.\n\n311\n00:15:03.252 --> 00:15:05.169\nThat's the easy part guys.\n\n312\n00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:06.840\nThis is when it get's\na little more convoluted.\n\n313\n00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.970\nWe're gonna say add network license here.\n\n314\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.880\nAnd this is a seven by,\nit looks like a MAC address right, but\n\n315\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.850\nit's actually seven bites.\n\n316\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:19.560\nAnd you're gonna need this, so\nyou're gonna go out to Cisco go licensing,\n\n317\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.250\nlog in to your CCO and\nyou're gonna get a pack.\n\n318\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.340\nIf you're buying an ASA with\nthe fire power module in it don't\n\n319\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.820\nthrow the box away until\nyou pull out that pack.\n\n320\n00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.210\nIt's a piece of paper, this is critical.\n\n321\n00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.294\nIf you do that you can call Cisco and\nthey will help you.\n\n322\n00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:38.530\nIt's just gonna take you a day, right?\n\n323\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.510\nSo, grab that pack, go out to Cisco,\ngo licenses, right?\n\n324\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.350\nAnd then you'll log in and you'll go and\n\n325\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.290\nit'll say, hey okay this is where you\nwanna go and you'll put in that pack and\n\n326\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.810\nthis number and it'll give you your\nlicense and you paste it in here.\n\n327\n00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.180\nIt's just a big long string of characters,\nright?\n\n328\n00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.591\nAnd then you submit the licence and it\ncomes back, it says success or not, right?\n\n329\n00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:02.577\nBut, you have to go out there and\nyou have to have that pact.\n\n330\n00:16:02.577 --> 00:16:04.738\nNow if you bought it and you're upgrading.\n\n331\n00:16:04.738 --> 00:16:07.892\nYour just gonna get the software, so\nyou'd have to get that from Cisco, or\n\n332\n00:16:07.892 --> 00:16:10.090\nlook in your CCO, or something like that.\n\n333\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.610\nNow, here's one key I\nwant to give you guys,\n\n334\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.990\nthat I have seen a lot of problems\nthat you don't hear anywhere else,\n\n335\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.975\nyou're gonna hear this here because\nI've done a lot of licensing.\n\n336\n00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:21.989\nThe IPS control and protect licenses.\n\n337\n00:16:21.989 --> 00:16:23.293\nThey're free.\n\n338\n00:16:23.293 --> 00:16:25.465\nThat is not a problem,\nyou get those when you buy the locks.\n\n339\n00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:27.965\nThe other ones,\nyou don't have to buy them, but\n\n340\n00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:30.702\nit's nice to have malware and\nyour own filter right?\n\n341\n00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:36.168\nSo the key is, is that when you buy it,\nmake sure you tell your representative,\n\n342\n00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:40.757\nhey, I want Firepower, and\nmake sure you click the IPS Licenses.\n\n343\n00:16:40.757 --> 00:16:43.160\nIt's a line on the purchase,\nbut the cost is zero.\n\n344\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.297\nIf you don't do that,\nyou won't get your pack.\n\n345\n00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:48.625\nNow again, once you get your box,\nyou're going to get your serial number,\n\n346\n00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:52.057\nyou send it in there, and you call Cisco\nand they generate the license for you,\n\n347\n00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:54.360\nsend it to you and\nyou paste it in another day, guys.\n\n348\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:54.983\nRight?\n\n349\n00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:57.387\nSo, make sure you tell\nyour representative.\n\n350\n00:16:57.387 --> 00:16:59.245\nMake sure and click the IPS licenses.\n\n351\n00:16:59.245 --> 00:17:02.026\nThat's your protecting control and\nthen that'll come down,\n\n352\n00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:04.553\nyou put in your pack and\nyou'll get your license, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:06.039\nNow, those are important things.\n\n354\n00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:08.097\nWe're gonna come back to updates\ncuz these are pretty important and\n\n355\n00:17:08.097 --> 00:17:10.450\nwe wanna schedule these so\nI'll get back to those later.\n\n356\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.170\nBut let's go to local.\n\n357\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:11.990\nThere's two things here.\n\n358\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.697\nConfiguration system policy.\n\n359\n00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:16.866\nNot much of a configuration here but\n\n360\n00:17:16.866 --> 00:17:20.343\nwe can do a couple of things\nthat you want to be careful of.\n\n361\n00:17:20.343 --> 00:17:22.650\nAnd I think we're going.\n\n362\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.241\nYep.\nFirst off, change the name.\n\n363\n00:17:24.241 --> 00:17:26.516\nTells us what it is,\nour code we're running.\n\n364\n00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:32.150\nFive four, the IP address,\nmy defense center, my current policies.\n\n365\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.300\nNotice here's my system policy connected,\nI don't remember doing that.\n\n366\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.329\nOh, these are what I have on my system.\n\n367\n00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:44.810\nBut here's my health policy, so\nI can do an HTTPS Certificate.\n\n368\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.570\nWhat this means, is when I go\nin HTTPS to my defense center,\n\n369\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.540\nit's going to say you're going to\nan authorized site, click advance.\n\n370\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.110\nYou can get rid of all that by adding\na user certificate right here.\n\n371\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.927\nIn this case here you can add\na certificate so when you go in with your\n\n372\n00:17:59.927 --> 00:18:04.768\nbrowser you don't see the message from the\nbrowser that says hey, click advance and\n\n373\n00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:05.469\ncontinue.\n\n374\n00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:07.801\nI can generate a key or import one here.\n\n375\n00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:10.855\nBe careful don't if you're gonna enable\nuser certificates here you're gonna stop\n\n376\n00:18:10.855 --> 00:18:12.068\npeople from being able to get in.\n\n377\n00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:14.550\nBecause they don't have certificate.\n\n378\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.915\nSo be careful if you click this so you\nknow what you're doing before you click\n\n379\n00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:20.699\non that right, so in this case\nhere if I click on this it's not,\n\n380\n00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.614\nit's going to stop my users from working.\n\n381\n00:18:22.614 --> 00:18:27.120\nIn data base here, I can use\nexternal data base for reporting for\n\n382\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.910\ngrading events and so on and\nI can send it to an external data base.\n\n383\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.049\nOn to the management interface here,\nif I get here.\n\n384\n00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.339\nSo that some of the things that, we don't\nchange a lot of stuff on this local\n\n385\n00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:42.756\nconfiguration, but it's something you\nguys want to take a look at, right?\n\n386\n00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:48.176\nSo we have some basic information here and\nthis is giving me my interfaces,\n\n387\n00:18:48.176 --> 00:18:52.479\nmy ethernet zero, my IP address,\ngateway and so on, and so\n\n388\n00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:56.972\nthis basically double checking\nyour management interface.\n\n389\n00:18:56.972 --> 00:18:59.333\nYou wouldn't be able to see that if it\nwasn't right cuz you wouldn't be in there.\n\n390\n00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:02.350\nIn this case here I can shut down\nthe defense center, reboot it.\n\n391\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.796\nRestart it.\n\n392\n00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:07.418\nYou very well could do that from here,\nI don't know if you would but you can.\n\n393\n00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:09.898\nIn this case here this is\ngonna not set the time,\n\n394\n00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:11.890\nwe're gonna take a look at this here.\n\n395\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.070\nAnd it's basically telling me how\nmuch I'm off and how unhappy it is.\n\n396\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.607\nAll right.\nSo my NTP server doesn't work very well\n\n397\n00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:21.413\nand I just haven't had\ntime to trouble shoot it,\n\n398\n00:19:21.413 --> 00:19:25.521\nbut nonetheless here, this is just\nbasically saying, hey I'm good,\n\n399\n00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:28.747\nbut 27 seconds,\nthat's an eternity for these guys.\n\n400\n00:19:28.747 --> 00:19:33.405\nAll right remote storage\nchange reconciliation on here,\n\n401\n00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:36.635\nthis is going to be able to show me, hey,\n\n402\n00:19:36.635 --> 00:19:41.306\nenable this and show me the changes and\nthen email it to me.\n\n403\n00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.466\nIf there's been a change with the policy,\nthen it'll email it to me.\n\n404\n00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:48.012\nOkay, VMware tools, we can install those\nand I would just kind of leave all\n\n405\n00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:51.630\nthis stuff here, but on the cloud\nservices here, I'm gonna click on this.\n\n406\n00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.906\nAnd notice it says enable URL filtering,\nenable automatic updates.\n\n407\n00:19:55.906 --> 00:19:57.866\nYes, these are clicked by default and\nwe want those.\n\n408\n00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:00.410\nDo we query the cloud for unknown URLs?\n\n409\n00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.540\nMaybe, maybe not, and we can update these\nup these the URL filtering right now.\n\n410\n00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.490\nAnd it's actually it's better off just\nset it up manually to run automatically.\n\n411\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.900\nIn advance malware protection we can\nshare information with [INAUDIBLE] now\n\n412\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.816\nthat's fine.\n\n413\n00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.984\nNow if I had some older devices,\nsome older appliances,\n\n414\n00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.230\nthey don't use 443 to communicate.\n\n415\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.970\nThey use 32137 to talk to the mCloud and\nso we're saying,\n\n416\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.520\nokay let's use that i have\nan old manage device so\n\n417\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.260\neveryone just use 32137 to\ncommunicate instead of 443 on air.\n\n418\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:37.080\nAll right so i'll go ahead and\nsave this and\n\n419\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.170\nNote we're gonna go ahead and use\nthe legacy, it doesn't really even matter.\n\n420\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.200\nBut let's go down to\nsomething more important.\n\n421\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.550\nYou may or may not have changed\nanything on that screen,\n\n422\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.106\njust you guys wanna take a look at it.\n\n423\n00:20:47.106 --> 00:20:49.623\nAnd let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the system policy.\n\n424\n00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:54.199\nNotice I have some down here\nthat I had already worked on.\n\n425\n00:20:54.199 --> 00:20:57.330\nHere's another demo one, let me go\nahead and clean some of this stuff out.\n\n426\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.916\nHere's the default, and there's an initial\nsystem policy and then there's a default.\n\n427\n00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:06.101\nLet's go ahead and say create policy and\nthen I'll just end up creating this one.\n\n428\n00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:09.160\nSo let me edit this pod one, right?\n\n429\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.201\nSo let me come in here and say I want\nto go ahead and edit this policy, and\n\n430\n00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:19.938\nthen I'm gonna end up applying it to my\none policy, or to my one managed device.\n\n431\n00:21:19.938 --> 00:21:22.360\nNow, so, these are more important.\n\n432\n00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.460\nThis is something I might change.\n\n433\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.470\nNotice I didn't really change\nanything in my health policy and\n\n434\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.370\nmy local configuration, but\nin here I probably will.\n\n435\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.500\nMy access control parameters,\n\n436\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.480\nbasically what I'm saying is in my access\ncontrol policy if a user is logged in and\n\n437\n00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.920\nthey make a change it makes sure\nthey have to put a comment.\n\n438\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.390\nSo it'll say put a comment\non what you did, right.\n\n439\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.110\nSo every rule will have\na comment on there.\n\n440\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.590\nSo you're forcing them to say why were\nyou here, and it'll log who it was and\n\n441\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.760\nwhat time.\n\n442\n00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.432\nAll right, on the access list is not\nnecessarily in access like you think.\n\n443\n00:21:50.432 --> 00:21:55.006\nWhat this means is who can get into this\nmanaged device on the [INAUDIBLE] center,\n\n444\n00:21:55.006 --> 00:21:56.793\nso who can manage this device.\n\n445\n00:21:56.793 --> 00:21:59.812\nIn this case here, we're saying any host,\nnow be careful here, guys.\n\n446\n00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:02.821\nI've had some customers come in here and\nthey had their device,\n\n447\n00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:03.999\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n448\n00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:08.129\nAnd we're saying HTTPS, that's fine,\nnotice we can only do 443 or 22.\n\n449\n00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:12.886\nAnd I'm gonna say, no, I want this managed\ndevice, and then I'm gonna cancel both of\n\n450\n00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:16.812\nthese, and only this one device,\nthis management PC can get in there.\n\n451\n00:22:16.812 --> 00:22:20.099\nWell what happens if you can't get to this\nmanagement PC or you typed it in wrong?\n\n452\n00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:21.273\nCuz I had a customer that did this.\n\n453\n00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.035\nSo I have the command.\n\n454\n00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:25.013\nYou actually have to go\nyou Defense Center and\n\n455\n00:22:25.013 --> 00:22:28.250\nuse the command line to delete that\nyou and it's just kind of cumbersome.\n\n456\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.148\nIt's not easy.\n\n457\n00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:32.418\nThe audit log is the same\nsend audit log syslog.\n\n458\n00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:34.372\nSo that's that system\nmonitoring the audit.\n\n459\n00:22:34.372 --> 00:22:37.919\nSo maybe here's the reason you wanna do\nthat, because a user goes out there and\n\n460\n00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:38.950\nscrews something up.\n\n461\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.740\nThey're like, oh my gosh, and\nthey go out and they change it.\n\n462\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.392\nAnd they're like, I can't let anyone know\nI did it, and they go to the audit logs\n\n463\n00:22:44.392 --> 00:22:46.990\ncuz they have the rights to do that, and\nthey delete it out of the audit log.\n\n464\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.410\nWell, that's completely what this is for,\nyou say, no no no,\n\n465\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.230\nI'm gonna enable this so\nwhen something happens in the audit log,\n\n466\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.817\nthey might delete it but\nI'm gonna see it still, all right.\n\n467\n00:22:54.817 --> 00:22:57.268\n[LAUGH] I'm not saying\nyou have to do that.\n\n468\n00:22:57.268 --> 00:22:58.820\nOn the dashboard I showed that to you,\n\n469\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.690\nhow it was customized, that was the very\nfirst thing we hit this morning and\n\n470\n00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.850\nthis allows them to make custom widgets,\nit's very cool.\n\n471\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.610\nLet me see what else I want,\nemail notification.\n\n472\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.210\nThis is something I use all the time.\n\n473\n00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.162\nYou put in your relay here and\nnow you can have things emailed to you.\n\n474\n00:23:14.162 --> 00:23:17.084\nYou have alerts and so on and\nsomething that tells you, hey my report, I\n\n475\n00:23:17.084 --> 00:23:21.240\ncould generate this report and it's ready\nfor you, or I did these updates and so on.\n\n476\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.899\nExternal authentication,\nthis is kind of important here.\n\n477\n00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:27.310\nNotice this is disabled and\nI wanna enable this, right?\n\n478\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.450\nAnd so I went out and configured LDAP.\n\n479\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:34.045\nNow this again is not for regular users\ngoing through but the box this is for\n\n480\n00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:36.579\nadministrators or admins or whatever.\n\n481\n00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:40.244\nPeople that come in that are trying\nto mans the defence center so\n\n482\n00:23:40.244 --> 00:23:43.768\nwe're going to going to use an L\napp server and an AD server and\n\n483\n00:23:43.768 --> 00:23:45.721\nallow them to log in externally.\n\n484\n00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:50.552\nOkay, now here's the key, you want to set\nthis right, you want to come in here and\n\n485\n00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:55.268\nturn that on but you also want to set this\nup as something this default user rule.\n\n486\n00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:57.887\nCuz heres what happens, they come in and\nthey have a local account.\n\n487\n00:23:57.887 --> 00:24:01.575\nWell if you have the defense center\nset up for external authentication and\n\n488\n00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:05.756\nthey'll automatically be created and\ngo ahead and do a external authentication.\n\n489\n00:24:05.756 --> 00:24:07.897\nThen their local account\nwill be disabled forever.\n\n490\n00:24:07.897 --> 00:24:11.260\nIn this point, they're external, and they\nwill be getting whatever default role is\n\n491\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.595\nset here, and\nif you accidentally hit Administrator, and\n\n492\n00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:16.650\nyou set this to Administrator,\nthen they become Administrator.\n\n493\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.926\nSo I would just set this,\nI always come in here and make sure and\n\n494\n00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:23.340\nset this to the lowest level,\nlowest administration, right?\n\n495\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:29.013\nAll right, and the languages, can you guys\nguess what languages that we can be in?\n\n496\n00:24:29.013 --> 00:24:30.876\n>> Well, I'm hoping for English.\n\n497\n00:24:30.876 --> 00:24:32.734\n>> Okay, it looks like English, US, yes.\n\n498\n00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:33.436\n>> Oh, is that the only language?\n\n499\n00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:35.114\n>> No, there's one more.\n\n500\n00:24:35.114 --> 00:24:37.170\n>> Okay.\n>> You have a 1 in 214,000 chance.\n\n501\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.082\n>> Is it UK English?\n\n502\n00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:43.203\n>> No, [LAUGH] that's a darn good answer,\nthough.\n\n503\n00:24:43.203 --> 00:24:47.510\nThat's what I would have guessed I think,\nbut the answer is English and Japanese.\n\n504\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.975\n>> So if you speak anything than that,\nthis product's not for you, I guess, but\n\n505\n00:24:50.975 --> 00:24:52.406\n[LAUGH] I don't know what to say.\n\n506\n00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:55.182\nThe other thing that I\nuse in here is my banner.\n\n507\n00:24:55.182 --> 00:24:58.208\nThis is something that says, hey,\nthis system is for authorized use only.\n\n508\n00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:02.817\nThis is Todd's, FMC, right?\n\n509\n00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:08.046\nAll right, and the network analysis policy\npreferences, we haven't talked about that.\n\n510\n00:25:08.046 --> 00:25:09.947\nThat's the pre-process,\nI did mention it, but\n\n511\n00:25:09.947 --> 00:25:11.586\nobviously we haven't gotten into it yet.\n\n512\n00:25:11.586 --> 00:25:14.529\nAnd basically, it's just saying,\nmake the comments,\n\n513\n00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:18.822\nif someone changes the pre-processor,\nyou need to know this cuz you're saying,\n\n514\n00:25:18.822 --> 00:25:22.920\nhow am I reading this data for my,\nhow can my smart rules read this data?\n\n515\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.200\nThis is pretty important,\nif someone changes this,\n\n516\n00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.000\nI'm going to say man this is required.\n\n517\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.180\nIn other words, the change would\nnever go through unless they put in\n\n518\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.710\na comma which would then put there name in\na comma and then the date and time, right?\n\n519\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.150\nSo, I'm going to definitely do that and\nand I am going to obviously set this to\n\n520\n00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.710\nauto up, this is pretty important right\nhere guys, so I would turn this on.\n\n521\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.590\nSNMP, now this is pretty simple here\nits just an SNMP configuness MP\n\n522\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.730\nhowever I can't use it\nUntil I come up here and add.\n\n523\n00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.550\nSo I'm gonna add my SMPs and\nMMS station, that's fine.\n\n524\n00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.250\nOr I'm sorry,\nI'm setting up to talk to an MMS station.\n\n525\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.180\nI need to come back up here to\nthe access list and add my MMS station.\n\n526\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.420\nYou guys paying attention here?\n\n527\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.430\nThis is important,\nI get calls all the time,\n\n528\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.210\nhey guys I set my box up with the SMP but\nI'm not getting any traps, right?\n\n529\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.650\nSo you gotta come up here and say, look,\nso 2.2 Is SNMP, that's my NMS station.\n\n530\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.210\nYou don't add that,\nyou're not going to get anything.\n\n531\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.440\nSo it's a two part process here.\n\n532\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.130\nYou add it in the access control list and\nyou add it down here.\n\n533\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:29.200\nNow this is something that you probably\nnever, never, ever want to click.\n\n534\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.400\nState compliance is a government\ncompliance policy that.\n\n535\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.370\nIf you know what it is, then you\nwould know if to click this or not.\n\n536\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.890\nOnce you click this, and\nsay okay, you can never undo it.\n\n537\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.000\nSo if you didn't want this heavy\ngovernment policies on here,\n\n538\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.130\nthe only way to get it off is to pick\nup the device and throw it away.\n\n539\n00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.900\nSo don't do this, alright?\n\n540\n00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.880\nSo it's very possible\nyou could call support,\n\n541\n00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.600\nnot that I'm aware of they can fix it, so\n\n542\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.160\nonce you make it in compliance it's there\nforever Unless you know what you're doing.\n\n543\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.170\nMost people just come in here and\nthey set up their email and\n\n544\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.510\nthey set up the time synchronization.\n\n545\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.090\nAlright, so I'm going to go ahead and\nset my time via,\n\n546\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.570\nset my clock via my NTP server.\n\n547\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.237\nAnd then for my managed devices, I'm\ngoing to get it from my defense center.\n\n548\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.310\nOkay?\n\n549\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.450\nAnd then now the user interface\nis something else that\n\n550\n00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.770\nI kind of do notice because I'm not\nusing this in a production environment.\n\n551\n00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.090\nThe default is 60 minutes\nbefore your HTTP screen.\n\n552\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.780\nThe one I'm using here\nan activity would sign out I said\n\n553\n00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.680\nit's 600 because I'm in a lab and\nI don't want it to sign out.\n\n554\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.540\nI would not do that, right?\n\n555\n00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.400\nThere's another button on here\nthat you never want, well,\n\n556\n00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.520\nyou might want to click it, but I'm going\nto tell you, you can't undo it either.\n\n557\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.830\nThat's down here, the disable expert.\n\n558\n00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.210\nSo if you're in, remember here,\nLenox, you type in sudo, right?\n\n559\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.410\nWhat this is going to say is nope.\n\n560\n00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.670\nIf you're at the command line\nyou can never on this box, ever,\n\n561\n00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.320\nonce you click this and\nsay save, go to no ever again.\n\n562\n00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.080\nRight, forever.\n\n563\n00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.150\nRight, can we say that?\n\n564\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.260\n>> It's a long time.\n\n565\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.670\n>> So, it's a long time, right?\n\n566\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.910\nSo, you're better off again buying.\n\n567\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.490\nSo I'm going to go ahead and buy a new\nbox, then try to undo these right?\n\n568\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.100\nSo this is probably,\nI don't know what this,\n\n569\n00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.370\noh it's complaining about my SMP,\ncause guess what?\n\n570\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.590\nI don't have one.\n\n571\n00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.620\nSo it's saying hey, you configured an SMP,\nbut you didn't put in the parameters.\n\n572\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.050\nVery unhappy about that.\n\n573\n00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:13.940\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n574\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.120\nI'm gonna save this.\n\n575\n00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.180\nAlright and we'll go ahead and\napply this in this section here so\n\n576\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.500\nwhat have we done in this section?\n\n577\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.940\nWe looked at the help pulse,\nwe looked at the system pulse,\n\n578\n00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.340\nwe talked about licenses.\n\n579\n00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.040\nAll this stuff is extremely important.\n\n580\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.570\nBefore I add any to managed advise to my\ncustomers, I go through all the stuff but\n\n581\n00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.010\nyou can add your managed advise\nlike we did and then come and\n\n582\n00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.780\ndo them but it's completely up to you.\n\n583\n00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.940\nSo did I say same policy?\n\n584\n00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.810\nNext, is it doing something?\n\n585\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.520\nI think so.\n\n586\n00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.440\nIt should take me back to the screen,\nall right?\n\n587\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.970\nSo I'll come back over here,\nset some policy We'll set this up and,\n\n588\n00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.650\ncall it a day on here on this guy.\n\n589\n00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.610\nSo he's on one, appliance here.\n\n590\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.870\nI'm gonna click this and add it and\n\n591\n00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.827\nnotice it is going to come back just\nlike last time from my appliances.\n\n592\n00:28:56.827 --> 00:28:59.850\nNot running real fast here right now,\nso we'll go ahead and\n\n593\n00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.660\ntake a look at that after we're done here.\n\n594\n00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.300\nSo I'm going to say go ahead now\nthat I've got a health dossy..\n\n595\n00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.350\nI've got my useless access control policy\ncontrol guide and I've got a health and\n\n596\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.600\nsystems quality guide so\nwe're getting there.\n\n597\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.920\nAgain, all of time I go and\n\n598\n00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.020\nI do all of this work ahead of time\nas I manage devices, bing bang boom.\n\n599\n00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.390\nOnce you do your health and systems policy\nand I typically use the same one for\n\n600\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.000\nall of my devices, so\nit's something you go through,\n\n601\n00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.180\nspend some time on it, and\nthen you kind of just put it to rest.\n\n602\n00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.030\n>> You really wouldn't edit it again\nunless you were adding like another\n\n603\n00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.780\nmanagement center,\nthen you'd have to repeat the process?\n\n604\n00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.790\n>> Well, no, you just apply the same one\n>> To that new, right?\n\n605\n00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.120\nSo, I'll just keep that one there.\n\n606\n00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.010\nIt's already configured.\n\n607\n00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.530\nAnd I'll click that green button that\nsays, who do you want to apply it to?\n\n608\n00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.180\nI'm like, hey, this new device.\n\n609\n00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.430\nAgain, so,\nI'll get these things going here.\n\n610\n00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.930\n>> Excellent.\n\n611\n00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.190\nAlright, so far what we've seen is the\nsystem policies and the health policies.\n\n612\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.350\nThose It's pretty important.\n\n613\n00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.160\n>> And we all talk about licensing and\n\n614\n00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.770\nits important to understand and\ndon't loose your pack.\n\n615\n00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.460\nIt's in your box.\n\n616\n00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.360\nI'm telling you too many customers have\ndone it, it's an all day event my friends.\n\n617\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.860\n>> I've sadly been through that process\nwith ASA licenses where the pack wasn't\n\n618\n00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.440\nincluded when I purchased\nit which was an odd one.\n\n619\n00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.750\nAnd it's not a good time\ntrying to go through and\n\n620\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.720\nyou basically have to convince\nthem your weren't providing it.\n\n621\n00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.720\nBut it is a necessary process,\nyou definitely don't want to lose that.\n\n622\n00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.760\nAll right well we got a chance to see\nthe system policies, we saw all our health\n\n623\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.710\npolicies, you mentioned useless\naccess control policy but\n\n624\n00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.090\nthat's just because have to have\nat least one in there right now.\n\n625\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.990\nWe're going to take a look at\nthose again later on right?\n\n626\n00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.380\nBut otherwise at this stage\nwe're pretty well set up.\n\n627\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.710\nWas there anything else we wanted to do\nin this episode before we moved on to our\n\n628\n00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.530\nnext topics.\n\n629\n00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.280\n>> I don't think so.\n\n630\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.080\n>> Okay.\n>> Licensing is very important in\n\n631\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.180\nthe updates.\n\n632\n00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.930\nThe screens over here again, I come\nthrough here and I do all this stuff and\n\n633\n00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:54.660\nthen add my devices but again we did it\na different way, it doesn't really matter.\n\n634\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.460\n>> It's whatever.\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n635\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.280\n>> You want to do it.\n\n636\n00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.175\nI like things in a certain manner.\n\n637\n00:30:58.175 --> 00:31:00.960\n>> [LAUGH] As long as you don't forget\nthings, I suppose it all works out.\n\n638\n00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.480\nBut, all right, well that's a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n639\n00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.890\nWe saw that initial set\nof policy configuration.\n\n640\n00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.523\nWe've obviously got a lot\nmore to get through.\n\n641\n00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:09.597\nStay tuned for that.\n\n642\n00:31:09.597 --> 00:31:13.778\nBut for now, signing off for\nITPro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n643\n00:31:13.778 --> 00:31:14.761\n>> Todd Lambley.\n\n644\n00:31:14.761 --> 00:31:16.108\n>> And, we'll see you next

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.496\nAnd welcome back to another episode of\n\n5\n00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:19.640\nITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.720\nBack again with another\nepisode of CISCO Firepower.\n\n7\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.394\nAnd, in our first series of episodes we've\nseen kind of getting our devices up and\n\n8\n00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:26.950\nrunning and where we can use them.\n\n9\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.640\nIn this episode we're gonna continue that\nwith taking a look at managing objects.\n\n10\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.424\nThese are the things that we're actually\ngonna be building rules around, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:36.980\ndoing all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.540\nSo definitely something we want\nto get set up in the beginning so\n\n13\n00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.255\nwe can take the most\nadvantage out of them.\n\n14\n00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.500\nAnd to help show us how, we've got Todd\nLammle back in the studio with us, and\n\n15\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.820\nthen Todd, let me turn it over to you.\n\n16\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.300\n>> All right, great, thank you.\n\n17\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840\nSo we're gonna create these\nobjects that we're gonna use in\n\n18\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.530\nour access control policies.\n\n19\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.754\nRight now now if we take a look at my\nscreen we'll see that we've got the system\n\n20\n00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:59.482\npolicy and health policy,\nwe didn't do a lot of work on that, but\n\n21\n00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.430\nyou can go through it and play with\nthose and get them to where you want.\n\n22\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.400\nCreate one and\npush it all out to your managed devices.\n\n23\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.080\nSo we can see here that I have, here's\nmy device and he's green, he's happy.\n\n24\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.380\nI'm having an issue with my\ndevice talking to the app cloud.\n\n25\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.660\nNot sure what that device, and\nI'll take a look at that later,\n\n26\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.880\nbut I'll see if there's\nstill a problem later.\n\n27\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.620\nThis will tell me how I'm licensed.\n\n28\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.540\nNotice I got my health policy,\nI got my system policy.\n\n29\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.180\nCreated those and pushed those out.\n\n30\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.910\nAnd I have a default access control\npolicy, and we're gonna build on that.\n\n31\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.270\nRight now it's not really doing anything,\n\n32\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.770\nit's just the default cuz\none needs to be there.\n\n33\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.520\nSo we're working towards that, right.\n\n34\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.771\nSo if we look up policies here, let me\ngo back here to policies for a second,\n\n35\n00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.671\nwe're not even doing any policies yet,\nright, so\n\n36\n00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:43.020\nwe've been building up to\nbe able to create policies.\n\n37\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.695\nIn this case here,\nwe're gonna go through our file policy and\n\n38\n00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:49.210\nintrusion IPS Snort policy and\nour access control policy.\n\n39\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.390\nCome back here to network discovery,\n\n40\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.830\nthat's kind of the path\nthat we're gonna take.\n\n41\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.440\nThese are the ones that\nI take all the time.\n\n42\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.743\nBefore we do that though,\nwe create something to help us,\n\n43\n00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:58.940\nwhat I'm doing here doesn't even need to\nbe done, it's just easier if we do it.\n\n44\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.732\nSo we're gonna create network objects that\nwe can use in the access control rules.\n\n45\n00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:08.728\nAlso create some objects that we can\nuse within our Snort rules as well, and\n\n46\n00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.360\nwe'll try not to screw those too much.\n\n47\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.620\nSo nonetheless, I'm definitely\nprobably gonna come in here,\n\n48\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000\nand I do this with every network, I just\ncome in here and create network objects.\n\n49\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.100\nWhy would I do this?\n\n50\n00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.320\nBecause when I create an object,\nnow I use that in a rule.\n\n51\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.160\nIf something changes, I just either add\nto that object or take it away, and\n\n52\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.300\nit doesn't affect my rules.\n\n53\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.150\nI don't have to change or\npush out my access control policy again or\n\n54\n00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.190\nanything like that,\nI can just change the objects.\n\n55\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.050\nAnd that's really,\nthis is a really nice thing for us.\n\n56\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.600\nSo in this case here I'll create\nsome individual objects, and\n\n57\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.680\nI'd do something like this.\n\n58\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.020\nCome here and say, Sales Server, right?\n\n59\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.250\nAnd, again, the reason I'm doing this,\n\n60\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.760\nI don't even care what\nits IP address is for us.\n\n61\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.006\nIn this case here,\nI'll just put a slash 32 in here.\n\n62\n00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.280\nAnd I'm basically gonna be\nable to use this in a rule and\n\n63\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.030\nthe reason I would do that is that I would\nsay I want to block the Finance Land from,\n\n64\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.230\nI don't know, getting the sales servers,\nusually the other way around.\n\n65\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.169\nBut notice I can do something\nlike this too, right?\n\n66\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.930\nAnd I can have multiple IP addresses\nassociated to this one object, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.820\nSo, you may or may not want to do that but\nyou have that option.\n\n68\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.260\nSo I'll just take that out and\ncreate this, this sales server right now.\n\n69\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.848\nThis is just an object, and\nthen I'm gonna create another object, and\n\n70\n00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:26.295\nI'm gonna do this, 10.10.10.0/20.\n\n71\n00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:29.920\nWhoops, nope,\nI'm putting it in the wrong place.\n\n72\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.368\nI'm gonna call this my\nInternal Sales VLAN, all right.\n\n73\n00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:35.730\nOkay, add that in there, so\nnow I have an internal sales VLAN.\n\n74\n00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.541\nThis is an object I can use to permit or\n\n75\n00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:48.300\ndeny them doing whatever\nI want them to do.\n\n76\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.050\n>> This system's a lot\nmore user friendly than\n\n77\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.950\nthe one in the ASDM-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n78\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.709\n>> Where you can't have\nspaces in the name, and\n\n79\n00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.750\nyou gotta tell it whether it's\na network or an IP, or whatever.\n\n80\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.560\nThis seems to just be really flexible.\n\n81\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.661\n>> It is, and here's one of the things\nyou gotta remember, and a lot of people,\n\n82\n00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:05.575\neveryone retty much ask me that, so\nif you've been working with network\n\n83\n00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.142\nobjects within the ASDM,\nthese are not compatible with them.\n\n84\n00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:11.363\nIn other words, people are like\n,well if I create all these objects,\n\n85\n00:04:11.363 --> 00:04:12.571\ncan I get them into my ASA?\n\n86\n00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:16.366\nAnd the answer is no, so we [LAUGH]\nwe have to create them objects for\n\n87\n00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:19.057\nour Snort, we create objects for\nour ASA, and\n\n88\n00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:22.794\nunfortunately at this point\nthey're not compatible, right?\n\n89\n00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:26.708\nAll right, so I'm gonna come in here\nI have the internal sales LAN and\n\n90\n00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.886\nlet me do something like DMZ Network.\n\n91\n00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:31.470\nAnd that ones 10.11.10.0/24.\n\n92\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.510\nSo I have my DMZN,\nmy internal sales VLAN, and\n\n93\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.591\nI might add another one and\nsay 10.11.12.0,\n\n94\n00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:48.170\noops, again name,\nOutside Network, whatever.\n\n95\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.219\nYou wanna create,\ntypically you create all your inside, and\n\n96\n00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.040\nI'm gonna show you something here.\n\n97\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.653\nBut I'm putting these in here for\na reason, and I'm gonna add these in here,\n\n98\n00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:58.000\nmy outside network in here.\n\n99\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.060\nAnd now here's an object that\nyou really should create, and\n\n100\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.210\nyou can do these by hand and\ndo them one at a time.\n\n101\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.090\nBut typically it'll say\nsomething like RFC 1918, right?\n\n102\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.120\nSo, I'm creating my internal\nprivate IP address ranges.\n\n103\n00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.050\nAnd now I can apply these and say, hey I\nwant these always permitted and so on,\n\n104\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.580\nso I use this object a lot.\n\n105\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.964\nSo I would come in here and\nI'll say, 192.168.0.0 /16.\n\n106\n00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:31.980\n10.0.0.0/8, notice I can\nadd as many as I want.\n\n107\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.190\n172, 16.0.0/12, and that's my RFC 1918,\nmy private addresses, right?\n\n108\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.657\nAnd so, I'm adding in there as\nan object and I've got one object now.\n\n109\n00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:43.520\nNow I could've created these as individual\nobjects, that would have been fine too.\n\n110\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.360\nBut in this case here now I have one\nobject that gives me all my privates\n\n111\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.120\nin here, I'm gonna use that one a lot.\n\n112\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.010\nAnd then I can come in here and\ngroup objects, I can say, Todd's,\n\n113\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.710\nI'm gonna group objects,\nCorporate Network, right.\n\n114\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.495\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nokay I want my DMZ, internal sales,\n\n115\n00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.000\nanything that's RFC 1918\nin my sales server.\n\n116\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.233\nAnd now this is in this group and I have\nall these objects now in this network\n\n117\n00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.500\ngroup that I can use, very kinda cool.\n\n118\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.740\nSo I can come in here and see this, this\nis maybe the only thing you do in Objects.\n\n119\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.778\nYou definitely are gonna come in here and\ncreate some network objects,\n\n120\n00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.346\neven if it's just the RFC 1918,\n\n121\n00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:23.770\njust something simple they can use\nin your access control policies.\n\n122\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.320\nSecurity Intelligence, let's go to that.\n\n123\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.854\nThis one is something I'd probably would\nuse, but you could probably leave this\n\n124\n00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:33.600\nalone in Objects and play with this\nin your access control policy.\n\n125\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.820\nSo a lot of this stuff down here\ndoesn't need to be used, set here.\n\n126\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.660\nCan be set just in our\naccess control policy,\n\n127\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.220\nI can even create network\nobjects in there.\n\n128\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.480\nBut in this case here, we're just\nsetting things up for success later on.\n\n129\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.700\nThat's what we've been\ndoing since the get go.\n\n130\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.899\nSo notice I have a Global Blacklist and\na Global Whitelist.\n\n131\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.670\nAnd we can see that, I can say Add\nSecurity Intelligence, Update Feeds, and\n\n132\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.600\nso I have a Security Intelligence Feed.\n\n133\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.285\nAnd what this says is how\noften is this updated and\n\n134\n00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.720\nthen basically it's two hours by default.\n\n135\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.872\nAnd basically we want\nthis feed the come in,\n\n136\n00:07:03.872 --> 00:07:07.920\nthis is giving us our blacklist of\nissues that is updated with our objects.\n\n137\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.720\nAnd when we get to the access\ncontrol policy, we'll apply this\n\n138\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.380\nSecurity Intelligence to our access\ncontrol policy and push that out, right?\n\n139\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.010\nSo, we can leave that alone,\nbut here's the deal.\n\n140\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.275\nI get a lot of people that have companies\nthey say they get feeds from the FBI,\n\n141\n00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:21.142\nthe CIA, and so on,\n\n142\n00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:24.630\nthey get security feeds that they're\nblocking stuff based on their contracts.\n\n143\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.556\nSo we come in here and say,\nI'm going to add Security Intelligence and\n\n144\n00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:32.210\nnotice I can add a feed, right?\n\n145\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.940\nHere's my MB, my URLs,\nor I can add a list.\n\n146\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.724\nA lot of people, what happens is they\nend of up with text files, and so\n\n147\n00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:40.290\nwe'll go ahead and\nadd this text file in here.\n\n148\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.380\nSo I'll browse, put that in here,\nand now it's an object.\n\n149\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.700\nThen I'll go to my access control policy,\nagain,\n\n150\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.510\njust creating this object\nhere does nothing.\n\n151\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.660\nI have to then go to my\naccess control policy and\n\n152\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.147\npush this into my Security Intelligence\ntab, which we'll take a look at.\n\n153\n00:07:53.147 --> 00:07:54.783\nSo I can go ahead and create that,\n\n154\n00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:57.951\nin this case here it's very\npossible you might do nothing here.\n\n155\n00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.970\nRight, and that's fine.\n\n156\n00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.900\nIn this case here,\nI can also create a port objects.\n\n157\n00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.080\nAgain, not something I use a lot,\nand the reason why is,\n\n158\n00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.960\nit's not that I don't use port objects.\n\n159\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.490\nIt's just, all this can be created\nin the access control post.\n\n160\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.980\nOh, I need the, I wanna block four four\nthree, or port 80, or something like this.\n\n161\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.790\nSo you can see some built in stuff here.\n\n162\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.650\nWe got HTTP and HTTPS, right.\n\n163\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.350\nAnd so, I might come under here,\n\n164\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.160\nand we can see all these individual\nobjects that are already here.\n\n165\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.830\nRight?\nAll this stuff that we can use.\n\n166\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.160\nAnd I can, I can add a port and\nsay, I don't know, drop box.\n\n167\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.285\nNow, notice I didn't say, \"lock Dropbox.\".\n\n168\n00:08:33.285 --> 00:08:36.753\nBecause in this case here, I'm just\ncreating an object, I'm not permitting or\n\n169\n00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:39.135\ndenying, it's just something\nI'm gonna use later.\n\n170\n00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:43.230\nOkay, I'm gonna say TCP, and\nI'm going to get the port here, 17,500.\n\n171\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.370\nNotice I can use UDP, ICP.\n\n172\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.850\nWhen I click other here guys,\ntake a look at this.\n\n173\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.910\nThis is my protocol field,\nmy network layer header.\n\n174\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.680\nIt's a eight bit field, so\nyou have 255 fields here,\n\n175\n00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.710\nso we will see whatever we can block\nwhenever we want without protocol field.\n\n176\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.380\nTypically, we will create\nsomething here with TCP or UDP.\n\n177\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.420\nAgain, you don't have to create it here.\n\n178\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.850\nWhen your access control policy,\nthink, hey, I need to block this,\n\n179\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.940\nyou can create it right then and\nthere on that, from that page.\n\n180\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.360\nI'm going to go ahead and save that.\n\n181\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.730\nBut, one of the things that I'll\nprobably do is, you know what,\n\n182\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.550\nI use, a lot of my customers, we do a lot\nof permitting and blocking of web ports.\n\n183\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.570\nSo I'm going to go ahead and create like\na group, and I'm going to say, web ports.\n\n184\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.540\nAgain, we're not saying\n\"block web ports.\".\n\n185\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.029\nOops.\n[LAUGH] Web ports.\n\n186\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.827\nI guess it was.\n\n187\n00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:29.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What I'm creating\n\n188\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.890\nhere is an object that I can use to\npermit or deny something with later,\n\n189\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.630\nwithout having to change IPs or\nprotocols, in this case, port numbers.\n\n190\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.370\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nsay, HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n191\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.010\nAnd basically, I can add these here.\n\n192\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.350\nAnd now I've got this web ports and I can\nadd now access to my control policy and\n\n193\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.910\nmake it pretty simple.\n\n194\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.330\nVLAN tags isn't something that\nI've seen used with the ASA.\n\n195\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.970\nI'm not saying it can't be, but I've seen\nthis when I had the appliances where we're\n\n196\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.250\nlooking at the VLAN tag coming through.\n\n197\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.000\nSo notice, if I click on the VLAN tags,\n\n198\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.780\nI need to click on them when\nthe objects are groups.\n\n199\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.440\nYou can easily add a VLAN\ntag in here as an object and\n\n200\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.120\njust come in here and say sales.\n\n201\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.800\nVLAN 100.\nAnd if they were 100 to 200,\n\n202\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.270\nthen, I can do something like that\nas well, or just individual here.\n\n203\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.350\nI'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this,\nbecause unless you have an appliance,\n\n204\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.040\nand it's running a switch,\nyou don't see the VLAN tag issue.\n\n205\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.640\nBut it's possible, so here it is.\n\n206\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.150\nYou know the thing I can do here is URL,\nagain, I'll probably,\n\n207\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.920\ntypically, wait until I get\nto MAC's Control Policy and\n\n208\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.030\ndo something with the URL, but I have\nthe option here to create URL objects.\n\n209\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.080\nAnd start coming here, you'll see\nthis same screen when I say add URL,\n\n210\n00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.950\nthis is the same exact\nscreen you're gonna get.\n\n211\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.860\nAnd this one here is,\nI'm gonna say Facebook, right?\n\n212\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.670\nAnd www.Facebook.com.\n\n213\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.080\nI may do something like this.\n\n214\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.920\nIt's very specific.\n\n215\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.280\nI might be a little bit more broad when\nI get to my access control policy.\n\n216\n00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.980\nTypically, if someone wants,\nI'll go into a customer and they'll say,\n\n217\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.010\nwe don't want social media.\n\n218\n00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.180\nThat's completely different\nthan just blocking Facebook,\n\n219\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.460\nbecause I have to go individually.\n\n220\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.030\nAnd that's what I'm saying here, right.\n\n221\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.860\nSo I could come,\nI could only add the one so I'd have to.\n\n222\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.760\nCreate all of, like I'd Facebook and\nTwitter and YouTube or something.\n\n223\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.380\nThen create a group and put all those\nin there and say, social media, and\n\n224\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.610\nhave all the ones I want to block in here.\n\n225\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.090\nThat's how, that's a way to do it.\n\n226\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.810\nI'm not telling you,\nit's the way to do it.\n\n227\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.920\nOkay, so we can go ahead and do that.\n\n228\n00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.190\nBut, I'll probably show you an easier way.\n\n229\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.710\nOkay.\n>> Can you do wild cards with those URLs?\n\n230\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.770\n>> No, actually, no.\n\n231\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.990\nI should have brought that up.\n\n232\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.290\nIf I did like Verisign, right,\nhow do you spell Verisign?\n\n233\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.100\nVerisign.\nSomething like that, right?\n\n234\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.399\nAnd if I, let's say, I did S-I-N-G.\n\n235\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.200\nAnd I did that assign that qual, right?\n\n236\n00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.810\nAnd I just, cuz I typed that in person.\n\n237\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.020\nWhat would this do, let's say, that I\nset this up as a blog and said, okay,\n\n238\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.720\nhere's my Verisign.\n\n239\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.290\nI named it Verisign, but I didn't type\nin the whole thing, because that was,\n\n240\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.120\nI don't know.\n\n241\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.850\nBut anyways, I didn't type it in and\nI put this out there.\n\n242\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.670\nI can't do this.\n\n243\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.120\nI can't say www.*, or not asterisk\nwildcard, I can't unfortunately,\n\n244\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.900\ndo something like this.\n\n245\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.930\nAnd if I do something like this,\nwhat would think this would do?\n\n246\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.110\nThis, with the AFI,\nput it as a block rule, for example,\n\n247\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.430\nwould block any, anything that\nended with S-I-G, sign.com right?\n\n248\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.550\nSo, in this case here, you can just\nput a period, and that would work,\n\n249\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.990\nand then, it'd be that one product.\n\n250\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.570\nOne site.\nI didn't even spell that right.\n\n251\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.380\nI'm gonna delete that,\ncause it's embarrassing.\n\n252\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.672\nWe'll edit that out.\n\n253\n00:12:28.672 --> 00:12:30.167\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] edit that out later.\n\n254\n00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:32.718\n[LAUGH]\n>> The guys at Verisign are, like,\n\n255\n00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.012\nman we thought we were\ngonna get free press and.\n\n256\n00:12:34.012 --> 00:12:36.501\n>> I know, I sound, like\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n257\n00:12:36.501 --> 00:12:37.831\n>> [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.\n\n258\n00:12:37.831 --> 00:12:38.866\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n259\n00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:41.567\nlet's run down here to variable satness.\n\n260\n00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:43.029\nYou may or may not want to play with this.\n\n261\n00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:44.744\nNotice, there's a default set here.\n\n262\n00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:48.622\nNow this is the one thing that doesn't\nhave to do with access control policies.\n\n263\n00:12:48.622 --> 00:12:50.340\nThis has to do with your snort policies.\n\n264\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.407\nYour snort rules.\n\n265\n00:12:51.407 --> 00:12:54.566\nSo you want to, kind of, be careful here,\non what you're doing here because.\n\n266\n00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:58.196\n>> A lot of SNORT rules have things like,\nexternal net, and home set, and DMZ and\n\n267\n00:12:58.196 --> 00:12:59.572\nHTTP servers, and all this.\n\n268\n00:12:59.572 --> 00:13:02.260\nThey're inside the rule set,\nand the reason why is,\n\n269\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.802\nif you didn't have these objects in those\nrules you'd have to go to 25000 rules, and\n\n270\n00:13:06.802 --> 00:13:10.626\nput IP addresses in there and if anything\nchanged in your DMZ you'd have to go\n\n271\n00:13:10.626 --> 00:13:12.800\nthese rules and update all these rules.\n\n272\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.900\nRight?\nSo, these, by using these\n\n273\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.750\nvariables it allows us to\nnot have to change these.\n\n274\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.370\nSo we can see them.\n\n275\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.110\nHere's, for example, the one that you\nmight change, so notice there's nothing up\n\n276\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.460\nhere as customized variables they're all\ndown here, you very well may this alone.\n\n277\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.560\nBut, you might want to come in here and\nsay, no, no, no,\n\n278\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.300\nno I want the Snort Rules to only be when\nthey say home net, they mean this exactly.\n\n279\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.580\nSo, I come in here and say, I want,\n\n280\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.580\nenter the name here, and\nI want it to be now, so check this out.\n\n281\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.510\nHere's my object right here, so\nnow, so I can use my object.\n\n282\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.280\nAnd say included in their 1918.\n\n283\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.880\nAll right, so\nbefore this saying no, no, no.\n\n284\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.400\nIs not in my home net, is only in my RC.\n\n285\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.590\nThis is where this object,\nI use this one all the time and\n\n286\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.010\nthat's why I use this as an example.\n\n287\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.320\nAnd every customer I ever been to,\nI built this object and\n\n288\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.720\nuse it certainly like this.\n\n289\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.700\nAnd this is good.\n\n290\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.570\nNotice, that I can, I didn't have to\ngo create the network object up there.\n\n291\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.560\nI can type in the IP address and,\nright here.\n\n292\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.005\nRight.\ni could say, you know.\n\n293\n00:14:11.005 --> 00:14:11.515\nTen, whoops.\n\n294\n00:14:11.515 --> 00:14:15.165\nLet me see if I can type this correctly.\n\n295\n00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:17.185\nNotice, I'm adding it here, right.\n\n296\n00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:19.645\nSo what's the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n297\n00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:20.805\nThe answer is nothing.\n\n298\n00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:22.605\nBut, I could do that, right.\n\n299\n00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:25.115\nSo in other words,\nkind of be careful with here guys.\n\n300\n00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:26.705\nBecause, if you're changing\nsomething here and\n\n301\n00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:29.045\nit's not right, then your snort\nrules not gonna trigger, right.\n\n302\n00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:30.915\nSo be kind of careful here,\nbecause as we go in, and\n\n303\n00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:33.245\nwe'll look at some snort rules\nthat have home net, DNC.\n\n304\n00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:36.460\nSo all this stuff is in those snort rules.\n\n305\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.150\nAnd the reason we would do this is so\n\n306\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.680\nwe don't put IP addresses\nthat would be ridiculous.\n\n307\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.550\nThat would be completely inefficient.\n\n308\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.060\nIt would give you a purpose in life.\n\n309\n00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.600\nI suppose.\n\n310\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.310\nIt would be all you would do but [LAUGH],\nin this case here, we're gonna use this,\n\n311\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.370\nand I'm just gonna get out of that, but\n\n312\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.150\nyou can go in there and put your\ninternal networks in there and that way.\n\n313\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.680\nYour stunt rules are if it says home net,\n\n314\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.070\nthen you're only looking\nat your particular network.\n\n315\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.150\nIt's gonna say if it's specific.\n\n316\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.240\nThe file list is my white and\nblack list for files.\n\n317\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.520\nSo before, we had our white and black list\nfor host or IPs, now we have it for files.\n\n318\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.250\nSo I can actually, come and add and\n\n319\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.780\ndelete a file out of the white and\nblack list of file list here.\n\n320\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.960\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on this clean list here.\n\n321\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.030\nAnd I can say, I want it.\n\n322\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.560\nNow, you don't actually\nadd a file by it's name.\n\n323\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.640\nYou add the actually, what?\n\n324\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.730\nThe hash.\nSo, I know somebody can\n\n325\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.770\ncome down here and say, okay.\n\n326\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.580\nI want to enter the shaw value.\n\n327\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.180\nOr I'm going to, I'm just going to.\n\n328\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.170\nTypically, we're going to calculate it.\n\n329\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.470\nI don't really want to enter it,\nif I can help it.\n\n330\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.350\nAnyway, so I'll go ahead and browse for\nthe file that I was saying, hey.\n\n331\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.840\nIt's clean.\nI know it's clean,\n\n332\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.450\nit's showing up as malware,\nbut this file is good.\n\n333\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.010\nIs this something you should do?\n\n334\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.878\nProbably not,\n\n335\n00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:51.283\nyou'd have to be seeing a lot of errors\nto do something like this because you can\n\n336\n00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:55.519\nnever say that once just because a file\nis fine it's gonna be the next time.\n\n337\n00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.075\nHowever its SHA would be different.\n\n338\n00:15:57.075 --> 00:16:01.263\nSo if I calculate the SHA and said,\nno I know this one that has this\n\n339\n00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:05.314\nparticular SHA Is good,\nthen I'm gonna put it my clean list.\n\n340\n00:16:05.314 --> 00:16:08.560\nThat means we would never get\na file disposition of say malware.\n\n341\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.890\nIt wouldn't be convicted right?\n\n342\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.190\nAnd we don't want a convicted file.\n\n343\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.510\nWe're saying this one's good.\n\n344\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.880\nSo someone says, well,\nif the file comes through next time and\n\n345\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.440\nsomeone had a malware it's true, but\nmy SHA would be different now wouldn't it.\n\n346\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.880\n, And what we're saying is, not that\nthe file is good, that That shaws good.\n\n347\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.640\nAnd I could do the same thing with the the\nblacklist, I could sit here and say, well,\n\n348\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.440\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna calculate\na shaw, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n349\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.180\nbrowse for a file and I accidentally, and\nthis is the same file, I put the same file\n\n350\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.680\nin, what in the worlds gonna happen is the\nwhite list overrides the blacklist right?\n\n351\n00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.890\nSo you always need to remember that the\nreason you put things in a white list is\n\n352\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.650\nso we don't blacklist them.\n\n353\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.330\nAnd we'll see that more as we get\nto the access control policy.\n\n354\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.610\nIn this case here,\nI typically might not add them in here.\n\n355\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.250\nYou can.\n\n356\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.270\nBut again, this is files.\n\n357\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.530\nNow, so where would I do this?\n\n358\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.590\nYou're like, well, if I'm not gonna\ndo this I know this file's good, or\n\n359\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.250\nI know this file is always bad.\n\n360\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.210\nWell, I'll show you when\nwe do event analysis.\n\n361\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.250\nI'm seeing this file,\n\n362\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.380\nremember we downloaded the packets\nto actually get the file.\n\n363\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.980\nI can right click it and say,\nadd to custom detection list,\n\n364\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.410\nmeaning add to blacklist.\n\n365\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:10.970\nRight.\n\n366\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.520\nSo, I, typically, won't do that here.\n\n367\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.740\nYou can.\nI'll typically wait, go to the event,\n\n368\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.100\nsee the file, and\nthen blacklist that bad boy.\n\n369\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.030\nOkay, we're not going to talk\nabout this next section.\n\n370\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:25.100\nThis has to do with my SSL encryption,\nand I can't even do that\n\n371\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.660\non the ASA's right now, at the moment of\nit's taping but, in the future we will be.\n\n372\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.920\nWe will probably want to use external\nboxes anyway, because of the processing.\n\n373\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.550\nSo, I'm not talking about that now.\n\n374\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.750\nHere's one of the things\nthat sometimes I don't do.\n\n375\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.080\nNow, depending on the Company.\n\n376\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.330\nThey might say Geolocation,\nI might say something like.\n\n377\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.880\nAdd countries right.\n\n378\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.045\nI might not, you know I would say,\nwell you know, need one from Africa.\n\n379\n00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:54.100\n[LAUGH] You know I'm\nkinda being mean here.\n\n380\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.410\nI don't have anything against\nthese guys right here.\n\n381\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.470\nAnd I need one from Asia.\n\n382\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.640\nAnd I just don't like\npeople from Australia.\n\n383\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.000\nNo. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm picking something here.\n\n384\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.240\nBut I probably wouldn't be that picky.\n\n385\n00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.730\nI'd come in here If I was doing that\nI would pick out something, you know.\n\n386\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.980\nAnd I gonna tap from a particular\nplace I can add them in here.\n\n387\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.840\nAgain, I can easily do this from within\nthe Access Control Hosts itself.\n\n388\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.080\nBut I can, you know, pick these countries\nand now I have an object that I can use\n\n389\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.165\nparticular in and\nwhy would I wanna do this?\n\n390\n00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:28.950\nWell, I get a lot of bad stuff\nfrom my site like India and so\n\n391\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.750\non and, I don't really do any\nbusiness in those countries.\n\n392\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.160\nAnd, so, I try to block those countries.\n\n393\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.700\nSo, I go to the IP addresses that are\nlisted for that country, add them to my\n\n394\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.720\naccess control list, well, I don't get\nanything for about a month or six weeks.\n\n395\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.760\nAnd then, these guys figured that out,\nthat hey, they can't get to my site.\n\n396\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.070\nAnd, they work around that.\n\n397\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.620\nThey're pretty resilient.\n\n398\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.020\nAnd I'm not saying good or\nbad though, I'm just saying look,\n\n399\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.865\nI don't sell anything to them,\nthey get alot of my product,\n\n400\n00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:54.990\nthere's no doubt about that,\nthey get alot of my product.\n\n401\n00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.505\nI just dont sell them anything, anyways\nthe thing is in this, in this case,\n\n402\n00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:01.745\nhere I'm creating an object and\nthis can be updated by Cisco for you and\n\n403\n00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:03.725\nthis object now can be your\naccess control policy.\n\n404\n00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.075\nI don't have to update my policy object.\n\n405\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:07.725\nIt just keeps getting updated by Cisco and\nyou know,\n\n406\n00:19:07.725 --> 00:19:11.575\nyou just need an IP control policy\nprotecting control and you're good to go.\n\n407\n00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:15.965\nAnd that's why you'd create a country,\nbecause the fact is is you don't want to\n\n408\n00:19:15.965 --> 00:19:19.980\nupdate IP addresses because they\njust change them all the time.\n\n409\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.870\nTime.\nIn this case here Cisco changes it for us.\n\n410\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.150\n>> I saw a similar example a few\nweeks back where they were doing,\n\n411\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.540\nit wasnt by country it was based\non Tor exit node addresses.\n\n412\n00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.270\nWith the Tor network a lot of the tags\ncome from an anonymous network and\n\n413\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.105\nthey change User IPs, but\nthey publish their IPs, they have to.\n\n414\n00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:39.935\nAnd so you can have a dynamically updating\nlist, but you can't do it yourself.\n\n415\n00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:42.965\nIt is just too much to try and\nkeep up to date on those IPs, but\n\n416\n00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:44.825\nan automated system can.\n\n417\n00:19:44.825 --> 00:19:47.105\n>> Yeah, and\nyou'll see that tomorrow when we go in and\n\n418\n00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:50.000\nsee Cisco's\n>> Default blacklist objects,\n\n419\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.060\none of them is that.\n\n420\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.470\n>> Excellent.\n>> And so, it's not added to your system,\n\n421\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.050\nso I'll show you how to add and\nput that into your blacklist.\n\n422\n00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.800\nIt's an object that Cisco creates.\n\n423\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.460\nI always choose,\nhey these are all Cisco ones.\n\n424\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.620\nThey know they're bad,\nthat's why they're here,\n\n425\n00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.850\nlet's use them and\nthey automatically update them.\n\n426\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.120\nLike he says it now.\n\n427\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.190\nAgain, we're getting our\nmoney's worth now, right?\n\n428\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.290\nThis is what we're paying for.\n\n429\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:09.880\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.200\nSo, what did we do?\n\n431\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.160\nReally nothing.\n\n432\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.730\nWe created something to make\nour life easier in the future,\n\n433\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.760\nnot for right this second.\n\n434\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.870\n>> And it's also one of those things\nwhere if we do this ahead of time, if we\n\n435\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.910\ndo this in the beginning, it saves us\na lot of time in creating rules and stuff.\n\n436\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.670\nI know I have been in this situation\nwhere it was kinda difficult for\n\n437\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.930\nme to go back and retrofit my system\nused object names to the ASAs and stuff.\n\n438\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.030\nI imagine it is the same here.\n\n439\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.150\n>> Yes.\n>> Quite a bit of a headache.\n\n440\n00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.250\n>> Well what's nice about this one is I'm\ncreating this on my FMC, my fem center.\n\n441\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.150\nAnd when I create that if I have ten\ndevices that I'm adding to this,\n\n442\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.670\nI can use all those objects for\neach of those devices.\n\n443\n00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.430\nSo, again, I come through system pulsing,\nhealth pulsing.\n\n444\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.210\nI create my object And\nnow these are all available for\n\n445\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.810\nme for any manage device\nthat I wish to add to this.\n\n446\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.370\n>> Excellent.\n\n447\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.860\nWell, I think that's a pretty\ngood rundown on objects.\n\n448\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.360\nI know we've got other\nthings we wanna tackle.\n\n449\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.990\nBut as far as objects are concerned,\n\n450\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.390\ndo you have anything else\nyou wanna throw in on?\n\n451\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.970\n>> No, no, no.\nThat's great.\n\n452\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.750\nNow we're gonna come back and\nlet's start doing something.\n\n453\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.490\nLet's start adding some policies.\n\n454\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.570\nAt this point,\nwe've just set ourselves up for success.\n\n455\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.660\nBut we haven't done anything yet so let's\ngo ahead and when we come back to our next\n\n456\n00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.330\nsection, so stick around,\nwe're gonna create a file policy.\n\n457\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.160\n>> And\nit's going to be incredibly exciting and\n\n458\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.125\nI know I'm on the edge of my seat.\n\n459\n00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:17.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I actually don't have a seat but\n\n460\n00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.400\nits still exciting stay tuned for that,\nI hope you guys have enjoyed it so\n\n461\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:28.610\nfar signing off for ITProTV I'm Don Pezet\n>> And I'm Todd Langley.\n\n462\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.465\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n463\n00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:33.650\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.500\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.530\nI'm your host Don Pezet Back again with\nanother episode of Cisco firepower and\n\n5\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.320\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at file policies.\n\n6\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.090\nI know we mentioned fire\npolicies in earlier episodes,\n\n7\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.370\nnow we're actually going\nto take a look at them.\n\n8\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.630\nWe've actually seen quite a few\npolicies at this stage but\n\n9\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.670\nwe'll dial in a lot of policies\nthat are very powerful.\n\n10\n00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300\nA lot of functionality there, and to help\nwalk us through it all, we've got Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180\nTom Landly right here\nin the studio with us.\n\n12\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.870\nTom, thanks for being here.\n\n13\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.350\n>> Okay, great to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.540\nSo if we're looking I\nclicked on policies here,\n\n15\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.820\nand we know that we worked on our health.\n\n16\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.430\nSo if we look at devices we\ncan see what's applied to,\n\n17\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.740\nI can't see the, the file or IPS policy.\n\n18\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.430\nOne, we haven't done them yet,\n\n19\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.240\nbut again, they are all done\nthrough the access control policy.\n\n20\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.870\nSo we'll get there tomorrow.\n\n21\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.410\nSo, but let's start with here, and\nfinish up today with file policy.\n\n22\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.630\nNotice, when I click policies,\nit picks the furthest policy on the left.\n\n23\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070\nIt's like when I click anything here,\nit's always takes the tab to the left so\n\n24\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.250\nI'm gonna click on fire policies here and\nwe're gonna go through a couple things.\n\n25\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.270\nSo this isn't a very long section, this is\nfront section because now we're picking on\n\n26\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.480\nwhat we can do with files,\nwhat can users do and\n\n27\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.380\nnot do so patrolling our users,\nthat's what this is all about, right?\n\n28\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560\nSo anyways, so\nI'm gonna say new file policy.\n\n29\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.620\nI'm, again I'm gonna create our whole goal\nhere is to get down from right to left.\n\n30\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.610\nFollow policy intrusion policy, and then\nput them in an access control policy, and\n\n31\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.960\nthat's where we're going to end up.\n\n32\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.750\nThem well come back here and\ndo some of the other ones, but\n\n33\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.680\nthese are our main ones here, so\nlet's say file policy and new file policy.\n\n34\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.410\nAnd again, I'm using Pod2 file policy.\n\n35\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.220\nSo name it that will help you when you get\nyour access control policy, understand it.\n\n36\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.130\nAnd also, in the description,\nwe can add here say save and notice,\n\n37\n00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.720\nthat I have a couple of things here and we\nfirst want to start with the advance tab.\n\n38\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.630\nLet's take a look at that and we'll go in\nhere and look and we'll add some rules.\n\n39\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.470\nAnd notice it says, hey you're creating\nthis and even when I create it is says but\n\n40\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.880\nno one's using this, right?\n\n41\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.780\nSo we understand that to get this\nfile policy to work we have to put in\n\n42\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.510\nan access control policy.\n\n43\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.260\nBut first off let's go through some\nfun stuff here on the advanced tab,\n\n44\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.070\nnow I keep saying this is fun stuff.\n\n45\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.250\nBut everything that we're\ndoing is fun right?\n\n46\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.654\nSo in this case here,\n\n47\n00:02:22.654 --> 00:02:27.430\n[LAUGH] I really like this here first off,\nenable custom detection list.\n\n48\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.350\nIf you remember what that is,\nthat's my file blacklist, isn't it?\n\n49\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.550\nEnable clean list,\nthat's my file white list, right?\n\n50\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.780\nSo we can go and add them, and\n\n51\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.400\nI'm gonna show you how to easily add files\nin there without doing a lot of work.\n\n52\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.400\nIn this case here, we wanna mark files as\nMalware based on the dynamic analysis.\n\n53\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.810\nNow I might leave this alone at this,\nthis is kind of a high threat score.\n\n54\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.760\nSo we're making sure if we see this,\nthat it is really Malware.\n\n55\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.860\nBut in this case here,\nI'm in a demo pod, and\n\n56\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.830\nI want it to alert,\nI want us to get us some data, right?\n\n57\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.280\nSo I'm gonna lower that a little bit.\n\n58\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.640\nAnd you can still do that in\nproduction I may leave that alone but\n\n59\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.050\ncheck this out this is something that\nstarted in five four inspect archive this\n\n60\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.580\nallows us to go in zip files and inspect\nthem for different types of files here.\n\n61\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.160\nIf its blocked its password protected and\nwe can't inspect it,\n\n62\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.640\nwe can say oh well not coming to\nmy network the other thing is,\n\n63\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.860\nif it's not inspectable or\nit's encrypted, we're gonna block them.\n\n64\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.910\nThe other thing is if someone zips and\nthen zips or archives and\n\n65\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.070\narchives and archives, that might be\nan indication of some shenanigans right?\n\n66\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.780\nSo we might wanna say well you know what?\n\n67\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.732\nI'm just gonna say maximum\narchive depth is one,\n\n68\n00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:36.104\nfits more than that,\nthen we're just gonna block it, so\n\n69\n00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:40.695\nwe can go ahead and set that here, so now\nyou can only go up to three here [COUGH].\n\n70\n00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:46.020\nAnyways, rules now we're gonna come in\nhere and now that we've set our demands.\n\n71\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.650\nIn that tap, come in here and\nsay let's add some rules.\n\n72\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.973\nAnd this allows to gives us some\nflexibility on the types of files that we\n\n73\n00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:55.220\nallow or not allow into our network.\n\n74\n00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.980\nSo in this case here I can choose the\napplication protocol and I could say you\n\n75\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.890\nknow, if it's HTTP and\na lot of times I do use this one a lot.\n\n76\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.670\nHTTP, SNMP now notice this\none if I choose SMTP.\n\n77\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.510\nSo what does that do?\n\n78\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.750\nNotice I can only, send.\n\n79\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.220\nRight it only allows me if it's uploaded.\n\n80\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.130\nSo in other words cause it only\ngoes in the one direction.\n\n81\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.090\nSame thing with like pop three,\npop three is to receive mail.\n\n82\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.030\nSo it only let's us analyze\ndownloaded files in this case here.\n\n83\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.990\nSo we'll go ahead and leave that but\nI could sit there and say,\n\n84\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.650\nif they're downloading whatever.\n\n85\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.150\nSo I can be very specific on what I'm\nsaying here, any applicational protocol,\n\n86\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.120\nany direction of transfer\nI'm being very broad now.\n\n87\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.790\nIn this case here I'm gonna\nsay they detect file piles.\n\n88\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.270\nNow that being defined, say hey just\nlet me know that these are down and\n\n89\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.310\nI can just go ahead and store these.\n\n90\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.240\nAnd then when the detect store the file\nI can set it up for analysis later.\n\n91\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.560\nAlright now I might want to do that.\n\n92\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.930\nI might want to do something like,\n\n93\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.750\nlet's go ahead and\nblock nowhere, this sounds fine.\n\n94\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.510\nSometimes we just detect it.\n\n95\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.050\nYou know, Malware cloud lookup and\ngive me a disposition on it,\n\n96\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.530\nthen we can decide what\nto do with it later.\n\n97\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.130\nBut in this case here, I wanna block it,\nnow notice I say, what I wanna do with it.\n\n98\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.230\nWell if I notice it this malware,\nI'm gonna send a reset, and\n\n99\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.330\nso they stop sending.\n\n100\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.990\nIn this case here,\ncuz TCP would just reset or\n\n101\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.700\njust keep going, keep trying to send.\n\n102\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.070\nSo this case here, I'm gonna say,\nand I wanna store the Malware file,\n\n103\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.010\nwhat is considered Malware.\n\n104\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.030\nRemember, we lowered our threshold on\nthat, so maybe it's not Malware, And\n\n105\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.200\nif it's not we can add\nit to our clean list.\n\n106\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.110\nBut I also want to store unknown,\nclean, and custom.\n\n107\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.070\nNot sure that I care about those, but\nmaybe I want to download those too.\n\n108\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.700\nIt's up to you.\n\n109\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.150\nIn this case here I typically\nalways choose these two.\n\n110\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.700\nI wanna download the Malware files and\ncertainly something unknown.\n\n111\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.880\nThat means it didn't get an analysis back.\n\n112\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.600\nSo what this allows me to do it is store\nit and extend it back up to the cloud for\n\n113\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.940\nanalysis later, so\nI always do that with my unknowns.\n\n114\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.480\nIt's up to you.\nIn this case here,\n\n115\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.400\nI might say hey let's back Malware\nif it's PDF and reset the condition.\n\n116\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.680\nIt's a very simple one right here but\n\n117\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.680\nwe're gonna store it if it's malware\nunknown and that we can play with it.\n\n118\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.940\nOkay, so I have a rule that says.\n\n119\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.910\nBasically block marrow.\n\n120\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.700\nI'm not blocking PDFs, am I.\n\n121\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.060\nIf they have Malware I am, and\nthat may be what you want to do.\n\n122\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.980\nOkay.\nThat's block mail with reset and store.\n\n123\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.300\nAll right, sounds good.\n\n124\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.110\nAll right, let's add some more.\n\n125\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.190\nWe can just keep the application protocol\nand direction of any, and we can be more\n\n126\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.650\nspecific, and say, for example if\nit's HGDP, I like this one here.\n\n127\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.660\nAnd we want to block files and\nwe can sit there and say if they're EXEs.\n\n128\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.850\nIn this case here we might wanna say,\n\n129\n00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.830\nwe want to do Malware cloud lookup and\nthey're EXEs.\n\n130\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.330\nSo in this case here we're\njust double checking,\n\n131\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.450\ncuz a lot of companies still don't\nknow EXEs can be downloaded.\n\n132\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.150\nAnd if that's the case, that's fine,\nwe're gonna do Spero Analysis.\n\n133\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.670\nNow Spero.\n\n134\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.080\nIt's in that source fire crate and\nit's basically metadata on steroids.\n\n135\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.380\nIt's many points more about that data, and\nthen, send it up for dynamic analysis.\n\n136\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.700\nNow stop, hold on.\n\n137\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.170\nThis takes some time.\n\n138\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.690\nThis could take maybe, up to 20 minutes.\n\n139\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.840\nIt depends on the cloud.\n\n140\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.720\nSo, at this point here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and store them and\n\n141\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.610\nunderstand that I'm sending the files.\n\n142\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.430\nIn this case here,\nI'm not even blocking them, so but\n\n143\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.880\nI'm gonna make sure that they're good.\n\n144\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.940\nAnd then if they aren't,\nI can go ahead and find them.\n\n145\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.700\nBut I'm going to go ahead and\nadd that for my executables here.\n\n146\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.150\n>> Now you've got this assigned\nright now to HTTP, right?\n\n147\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.070\n>> Oh yeah, yes I do.\n\n148\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.590\nThat's actually so.\n\n149\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.850\nGo to HTTP and\ndownload executables from within so\n\n150\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.460\nif I am not looking for that,\nyou know I might miss it.\n\n151\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.750\n>> So if I wanted, let's say we\nhad other protocols like SMB, or\n\n152\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.060\nFTP this wouldn't catch it.\n\n153\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.970\nWe'd have to create additional\npolicies for those?\n\n154\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.060\n>> That's a good question.\n\n155\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.650\nThat's a good point yes.\n\n156\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.830\nI'm only looking because I get\na lot of people that go out to HP.\n\n157\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.570\nA lot of my customers go out there and\ntheir downloading executables within HGP,\n\n158\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.050\nthat's very common right?\n\n159\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.830\nSo, anyways, so add files.\n\n160\n00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.610\nAnd, let's say that they're encoded, or\n\n161\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.660\nlet's say I don't want\nany office documents.\n\n162\n00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.780\nRight.\nI mean who knows right.\n\n163\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.475\n>> I don't want any office documents.\n\n164\n00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:01.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I don't want anyone to send me\n\n165\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.970\nany work.\n\n166\n00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.400\nSo, I'm just going to go ahead and\nwe'll just say screw it,\n\n167\n00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.710\nwe're just gong to block that.\n\n168\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.430\nDon't be sending me anything to update.\n\n169\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.860\nDave, if you can't do it yourself.\n\n170\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.490\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nstore the files.\n\n171\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.410\nAnd look at all the different types here,\nright?\n\n172\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.310\nAnd so add it all in there and\nmaybe we'll get an error here, let's see.\n\n173\n00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.490\nNow sometimes if one overrides\nthe other it will tell you.\n\n174\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.420\nLet's add another one for fun.\n\n175\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.530\nAnd here, let's go ahead and\ndo multimedia,\n\n176\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.760\nbecause this would be something like MP4s.\n\n177\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.820\nAnd I can notice flash videos, right?\n\n178\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.111\nAnd so I don't want Flash videos or\nmaybe do, but I don't want the MP4s.\n\n179\n00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.830\nFirst off, I wanna download MP4s,\nI wanna detect and I wanna store it,\n\n180\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.030\nbecause if someone's downloaded an MP4,\nmaybe I want it.\n\n181\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.870\nRight?\n[LAUGH] Gotta grow that movie collection\n\n182\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.683\nsome how.\n\n183\n00:08:48.683 --> 00:08:51.970\n>> [LAUGH] If they're gonna\nbuy it hey [LAUGH] sorry.\n\n184\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.900\nI'm being mean here.\n\n185\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.930\n>> Or in your scenario if someone's\nbootlegging your copy you might as well\n\n186\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.440\nget a copy.\n\n187\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.280\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah good.\n\n188\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.850\nSo you can tell me if they're downloaded.\n\n189\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.100\nI'm just being a little punchy\nat the end of the day here guys.\n\n190\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.160\nI'm just having fun here, but\nI'm just trying to show you how specific\n\n191\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.550\nyou can be and say, at this point I'm just\ndetecting how they're doing MP4 files.\n\n192\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.160\nMaybe someone asked me to do that or\ndetect them if they have exes.\n\n193\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.270\nI had some customers when I went out there\nthat said EXEs I just want to send it up\n\n194\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.190\nfor spyware analysis.\n\n195\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.310\nMake sure that it's a good file.\n\n196\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.600\nWe're gonna let them download it,\nI can't stop that, but\n\n197\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.850\nI can at least know if it's a bad file,\nnow let's see if I get any errors here.\n\n198\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.590\nYou'll see some conflicts that will tell\nyou hey, there's conflicts over here so\n\n199\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.020\nI just create a file now that\nsays detect files in pdf.\n\n200\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.300\nSo let me type that in here and\nstore them,\n\n201\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.070\nI want to make sure and\nsee if anyone's doing any PDFS.\n\n202\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.480\nWe should probably get some sort of error,\nI would imagine here.\n\n203\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.019\nI thought we did PDFS already.\n\n204\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.730\nWell I must a did something right.\n\n205\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.090\nAnyways, so I'm just detecting them here,\nI would delete that.\n\n206\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.550\nBut it'll tell you if you have an overlap\nand it's one's doing the other\n\n207\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.370\nyou'll get a yellow triangle and\nyou can go in and fix it.\n\n208\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.630\nSo in this case here, I blocked Malware\nthree so it said, stored files,\n\n209\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.990\nmalware cloud lookup for executables.\n\n210\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.690\nAnd did Spiro analysis on it.\n\n211\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.840\nThis is very common guys.\n\n212\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.780\nAnd if they were encoded.\n\n213\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.520\nYou know office documents were blocking\nthem and MP4's, we wanna download those.\n\n214\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.420\nAll right.\nSo, basically, what we went through,\n\n215\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.820\nthere's not a lot of work to this guys.\n\n216\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.100\nYou basically.\n\n217\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.500\nHow do you decide what to do here?\n\n218\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.170\nSo, I go to the customer and they said,\nwe need, again, I mentioned this before\n\n219\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.560\nthey come in and say hey, we need you\nto set this up, well that's great.\n\n220\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.170\nGive me a couple of your security\npolicy so I can go through it so\n\n221\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.490\nI can understand how to\ndo my policies here.\n\n222\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.730\nI can't do it because their policy\nmight say we don't want any MP4s,\n\n223\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.920\nwe don't want any EXEs,\nwe want to make sure PDFS are clean, or\n\n224\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.820\nwe don't allow PDFS or any downloads.\n\n225\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.140\nI need to know all that so\nI can create my file policy.\n\n226\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.630\nI can't create this out of the blue.\n\n227\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.470\nI can, but really have some direction\nthat would be great wouldn't it?\n\n228\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.220\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsave this bad boy here.\n\n229\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.430\nNot a lot of work into this guy here.\n\n230\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.260\nAre we blocking PDF now?\n\n231\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.810\nIs my box blocking PDF's?\n\n232\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.640\n>> The policy is configured to do it, but\n\n233\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.520\nif we actually apply\nthat to our traffic yet.\n\n234\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.460\n>> We have to put it through our access\ncontrol policy, which we haven't\n\n235\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.340\ngotten yet, Again, everything we've done\nall day long we're just building up,\n\n236\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.590\nbuilding up, building up and\nwe haven't really done anything yet.\n\n237\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.830\nSo we're building up based on our\nsecurity policy, our health policy,\n\n238\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.160\nour system policy,\nour system configuration.\n\n239\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.270\nWe did our objects and\nwe did file polices.\n\n240\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.590\nFirst, we had to install and\ncreate our device.\n\n241\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.430\nSo this isn't something\nthat you can do and say,\n\n242\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:32.310\nhey I want to download and upgrade my\nASA and, I'm gonna do it at lunch.\n\n243\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.440\nI'm gonna create my policies and\nhave it all done by 1:00.\n\n244\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.440\nIt kinda doesn't quite work that way.\n\n245\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.760\nWe got a little bit more work.\n\n246\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.920\nBut you notice that if we plan ahead and\n\n247\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.710\nbuild our defense center we\ncan have all this done and\n\n248\n00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.290\nit's possible you can do this over lunch\n[LAUGH] as long as you think ahead.\n\n249\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.330\nSo before we finish the section, wasn't\na very long section in this case here,\n\n250\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.930\nbecause again, we can't test it.\n\n251\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.400\nAnd we put in our access control policy,\nlet me come over here and\n\n252\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.790\ntake a look at some of the stuff\nthat some smart guys at Cisco\n\n253\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.280\ndid lets see what they did in there's.\n\n254\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.740\nNotice they're not I can't see\nthis very well in that archive,\n\n255\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.500\nchecking archives everything\nbasically at default here lets,\n\n256\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.020\ntake a look here cloud look up I\ndon't know if you can see this.\n\n257\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.650\nLet's see what they did.\n\n258\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.040\nThey're not storing any files here.\n\n259\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.710\nJust looking at a demo cloud on Cisco and\nbasically seeing what they did.\n\n260\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.450\nThey're saying, just do a Malware\ncloud look up on all these guys here.\n\n261\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.570\nWe're not storing it.\n\n262\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.720\nWe're not blocking anything.\n\n263\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.120\nWe're just gonna check all\nfiles that come in for Malware.\n\n264\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.666\nAnd we'll get [INAUDIBLE] on that.\n\n265\n00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.310\nAnd then on this one here,\nwe're gonna detect files on what?\n\n266\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:39.290\nSo now we're doing a Malware lookup and\nthen detecting them,\n\n267\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.000\njust so we can know that they were\ndone but we haven't blocked anything.\n\n268\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.830\nNot nearly as fun as when\nyou get to do a block and\n\n269\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.980\nyou get to see that in\nyour event analysis.\n\n270\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.220\nSay hey there's a blocked file,\nand by the way, here's the file.\n\n271\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.630\nNow we can play with that file,\n\n272\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.530\ntake it down to our sandbox,\nand then system and so on.\n\n273\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.070\nSo that's pretty much it for\nfile policies.\n\n274\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.140\nWanna go in there and\ncreate those, and decide,\n\n275\n00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.280\nbased on their security policy,\nwhat we're going to allow.\n\n276\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.840\nNot allow.\n\n277\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.100\nIf we're just gonna.\n\n278\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.590\nIn this case here,\nI'm looking at this guy.\n\n279\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.180\nThey're not really doing anything.\n\n280\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.140\nWe're doing a lot more fun stuff\nwith ours here, by blocking files.\n\n281\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.580\nAnd making sure our users know\nwho's in control around here.\n\n282\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.225\nSo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.244\n>> And, this process happens really fast.\n\n284\n00:13:18.244 --> 00:13:21.890\nYou said that, basically,\nwe're gonna create a hash to that\n\n285\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.600\nfile when we do a Malware cloud lookup\nwe're just sending a hash up to Cisco.\n\n286\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.050\n>> So basically it has two seconds, so\n\n287\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.420\nfrom the time the file comes into the\nmanage device it goes to the fend center,\n\n288\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.750\ngoes out to the malware cloud, back to\nthe fend center with the disposition and\n\n289\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.810\nthen comes tells the manage\ndevice how to do it.\n\n290\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.200\nIt has to happen within two seconds or\nthe file is going to be let go.\n\n291\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.000\nSo, just to help me out here and\nmake sure I understand, if I go\n\n292\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.280\nto Microsoft's website and I download\nan ISO image and it's four gigs in size,\n\n293\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.770\nthe hash can't really be done until\nthe whole file is downloaded, correct?\n\n294\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.950\n>> So, what happens is\n>> We take the file and\n\n295\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.160\nwe're actually transferring a file.\n\n296\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.550\nSo if it's a large file,\nwe're transferring everything, and\n\n297\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.190\nwe hold onto the last piece.\n\n298\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.910\nSo we got the whole file, but\nwe're holding onto the last packet.\n\n299\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.835\nSo what would happen if we had some file\nAnd then we found out it was malware.\n\n300\n00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:13.285\nAnd, so, we transferred\nthe whole file to be efficient.\n\n301\n00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:14.845\nIt's very cool the way that works.\n\n302\n00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:17.695\nAnd we hold on to that last piece,\nbut we never send that last piece.\n\n303\n00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:18.425\nWhat would happen?\n\n304\n00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:19.125\n>> The file's damaged.\n\n305\n00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.165\n>> It would never execute.\n\n306\n00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:21.210\nRight.\nSo The fact is,\n\n307\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.890\nwe hold onto that until we\nget a file disposition.\n\n308\n00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.680\nThen, when we found out it's clean or\nwhatever,\n\n309\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.240\nbased on our policy, we'll let it go.\n\n310\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.890\nOr we'll discard it, and\nthe file will never execute.\n\n311\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.950\nSo it's only two seconds.\n\n312\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.450\n>> Right.\n\n313\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.370\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH] So, you know?\n\n314\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.530\nWe've got to do a lot\nof work in two seconds.\n\n315\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.400\n>> Yeah.\nI was thinking,\n\n316\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.810\nlike, if it had to download\nthe whole four gig file.\n\n317\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And my clients.\n\n318\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.380\nStill doesn't know about it obviously\nit's going to time out before then.\n\n319\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.540\nBut if it does [INAUDIBLE]\nit's pretty smart.\n\n320\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.130\nYou'd almost think that somebody at\nCisco knew what they were doing.\n\n321\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.080\n>> Yeah there's some really\nsmart people there man.\n\n322\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.830\nThese guys are really really smart.\n\n323\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.590\n>> All right that's pretty much it for\nfile policies and it's exactly like you\n\n324\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.270\nsaid Todd is we've created some\nreally good stuff at this point and\n\n325\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.150\nwe get an idea of some of\nthe things that fire power can do.\n\n326\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.520\nBut it's not actually doing any of it yet,\nso that next logical step is gonna be\n\n327\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.780\nactually setting up the IPS side of\nthings, actually setting up our control,\n\n328\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.770\nand that is what is gonna be\ncoming up next, but for now,\n\n329\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.710\nit's probably a good spot\nto wrap up file policies.\n\n330\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.820\nDid you have anything else\nyou wanted to throw in Tom?\n\n331\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.260\n>> No, that was great I think,\n\n332\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.030\nstick around guys because\nwe're gonna go out there and\n\n333\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.050\ndo our IPS policies, I don't wanna\n>> The rest of the day it's\n\n334\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.630\nkind of intense, so when you come back for\nthe IPS policies understand that, hey,\n\n335\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.100\nwe're gonna hit something a little\nbit more intense than we've done yet.\n\n336\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.110\nSo we've gone through the installation,\ngone through an upgrade in\n\n337\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.790\nthe installation and by the way, so we\ncan bring up and take a look at here's my\n\n338\n00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.390\nPod1 and we can see that Yeah, it looks\nlike it didn't download everything.\n\n339\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:50.330\nI can tell this by sessionsfr and\nnotice that I'm in now.\n\n340\n00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.510\nSo, my asa is now upgraded so\nwhere am I, guys?\n\n341\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.500\nI'm at the same place, I'm at the one\nwhere we bought it with the module in it,\n\n342\n00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.680\nnow this one is in that some spot.\n\n343\n00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.850\nNow I just have to go and configure it.\n\n344\n00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.570\nAnd it's good to go, and now it's\nlike we bought it with the module but\n\n345\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.590\nwe did it ourselves.\n\n346\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.870\n>> We're in the exact same spot,\nit just took a hell of a lot longer.\n\n347\n00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.942\n[LAUGH]\n>> It took us all day actually because\n\n348\n00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:13.376\nI kinda didn't hit press enter in time and\nit got frustrated with me and quit.\n\n349\n00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:16.490\n>> Yeah cuz they don't\n>> See that, they magic of television.\n\n350\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.350\nBut yeah we went to lunch.\n\n351\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.960\nWe filmed some other shows.\n\n352\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.620\nIt took awhile.\n\n353\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.450\n>> It did it did.\n\n354\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.460\nIt was in the oven for awhile but\nnow it's out of the oven, it's cooked,\n\n355\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.290\nit's ready to eat so.\n\n356\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.900\n>> Alright well ladies and\ngentlemen it's been a lot of fun.\n\n357\n00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.370\nBut this is where we're going\nto wrap this episode up.\n\n358\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.170\nStay tuned because we've got more fire\npower action coming up after this.\n\n359\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.390\nFor now, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n360\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.600\n>> And, I'm Todd Lanley.\n\n361\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.720\n>> And, we'll see you next time.\n\n362\n00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.203\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.950\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro Tv.\n\n4\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.580\nI'm your host Don Pazette back again with\nanother episode of Cisco Fire Power.\n\n5\n00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.040\nAnd we've got an exciting one lined up\nbecause in all of our previous episodes,\n\n6\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.650\nwe've kinda been getting ready to have\nour device actually do some filtering and\n\n7\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.990\nprotection, but\nwe haven't actually done it yet.\n\n8\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.620\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at IPS policies,\n\n9\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.620\nwhere we actually get to see that happen.\n\n10\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.530\nSo pretty exciting time, definitely\nwhat we've been building up to and\n\n11\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.070\nhere to help us once again is Mr.\nTodd Lammle in the studios.\n\n12\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.060\nTodd, thanks for being here.\n\n13\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.440\n>> Thank you, good to be here again.\n\n14\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.220\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nstart with IPS policies.\n\n15\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.510\nAnd really what we're doing\nis configuring Snort, and\n\n16\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360\nwhat rules are active, and so on.\n\n17\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.020\nAgain, we can go ahead and\ndo this by hand with our text files, but\n\n18\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.970\nwhat we're really gonna do is\nuse the GUI to our advantage.\n\n19\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.805\nAnd we're also gonna learn things like\nhow to go ahead and add even a new rule.\n\n20\n00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:09.660\nBut things like, hey, while we're doing\nevents and we're seeing these events, if\n\n21\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.650\nit's a false positive, maybe we suppress\nthat rule from coming from a certain host.\n\n22\n00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.850\nThat we know, it's not really bad.\n\n23\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.600\nIt's coming from our R/D department.\n\n24\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.410\nI see this a lot at my\ndifferent customers.\n\n25\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.031\nSomething else, we can blacklist\ndifferent events and so on.\n\n26\n00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:29.400\nAnd also how we can have this device,\nhow we can have Firepower and\n\n27\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.971\nFireSIGHT come in here and say, hey, this\nis what I've seen go on in your network.\n\n28\n00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:37.740\nLet me make some suggestions on what\nwe should do with these sort rules.\n\n29\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.650\nAnd we'll see that now that's gonna\ntake a little bit of effort today,\n\n30\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.970\nbecause to be able to do that\nwe have to get some data.\n\n31\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.770\nSo when I first do this IPS section,\n\n32\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.780\nwe won't be doing what they\ncall FireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n33\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.030\nWe gotta come back to that because I\nhave to finish configuring our device.\n\n34\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.530\nAnd as we take a look,\nlet's go ahead and go to my screen.\n\n35\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.471\nBut if we go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n36\n00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.150\nWe'll see that we haven't\nfinished our policies.\n\n37\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.540\nWe're not even pushing any data, right?\n\n38\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.600\nSo we're gonna do our IPS policies.\n\n39\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.680\nThen we're gonna go and put our file\npolicy that we created yesterday.\n\n40\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.720\nAnd our IPS policy we'll create today.\n\n41\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.400\nAnd we'll create an access control policy,\nand put that in and push that out and\n\n42\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.810\nnow our devices are configured\nare ready to go.\n\n43\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.740\nAt that point there we can\nstart collecting data.\n\n44\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.348\nWe'll come back, we'll see some attacks,\nand we'll see them being recorded, and\n\n45\n00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:25.040\nwe'll go and look at some events,\nit will be fun.\n\n46\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.685\nAnd then after some data runs we'll go and\n\n47\n00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.130\nwe'll configure what's called\nnetwork discovery policy.\n\n48\n00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.720\nSo that's kinda our goal this morning.\n\n49\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.695\nSo let's go ahead and get started with IPS\npolicies and taking a look at Snort rules.\n\n50\n00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:36.320\nOkay but\n\n51\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.870\nfirst on my screen I wanted to show you,\nwe had Pod2 that I was configuring.\n\n52\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.580\nWe can still see that it has\na health problem here, but\n\n53\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.200\nit's not the same one as yesterday.\n\n54\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.770\nThat was just yeah,\nI couldn't get to the cloud.\n\n55\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.460\nWe don't know why that happened,\nI don't really even care right now.\n\n56\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.010\nBut the fact is,\nI see it like this a lot where I see,\n\n57\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.570\nhey this guy's green, I'm happy.\n\n58\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.100\nThis guy's red and I can see it up here in\nmy health, where hey, someone's unhappy.\n\n59\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.020\nWell if I come here and I click on\nthis and I take a look and I see why,\n\n60\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.410\nthis is what you'll see if you\nhave two ASA's in this example,\n\n61\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.070\nthat are running high availability.\n\n62\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.760\nAnd we're gonna see one,\nis hey it's pushing data, I'm happy,\n\n63\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.740\neverything's great.\n\n64\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.590\nAnd if we look down here we see data\nplane zero not receiving any packets,\n\n65\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.800\nthis is what we see.\n\n66\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.810\nSo a lot of my customers are like, hey\nfix this,which then we go onto the health\n\n67\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.860\npolicy and we can say,\nhey don't monitor that interface, right.\n\n68\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.210\nBut then if they switch over,\nwe're not monitoring that interface,\n\n69\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.040\nit's kinda there's no great\nanswer to this, right?\n\n70\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.950\nI've heard it's on a road map to\nfix something like this where high\n\n71\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.020\navailability says, I'm not seeing this,\nI'm running this high availability.\n\n72\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.320\nBut that's normal,\nright now it's not gonna show as normal.\n\n73\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.220\nThis isn't necessarily a problem here,\nI just don't have any data I'm pushing.\n\n74\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.440\nThere's no host on the other side of this,\nas of yet.\n\n75\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.170\nThat's why.\n\n76\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.320\nOkay, so no big deal.\n\n77\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.630\nI just wanted to explain that to you\nwhen you see this in production,\n\n78\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.875\nwhich I see every day on all my customers,\nright.\n\n79\n00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:55.770\n[COUGH] So that being said,\nhere's my devices, and we're pretty happy.\n\n80\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.020\nWhat I did is yesterday I went and\nfinished configuring pod one.\n\n81\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.524\nBecause we had got, we installed it and it\nwas at the point where we say, hey we're\n\n82\n00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:09.181\nbuying this, we're pulling it out the box,\nremember beforehand what have I done?\n\n83\n00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:12.261\nI went to my defense center,\nmy FMC and I licensed it.\n\n84\n00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:13.481\nAnd I added licensing.\n\n85\n00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.750\nYou can see there were two licences\non there as we looked at yesterday.\n\n86\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.610\nI also created a system policy and\nhealth policy.\n\n87\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.050\nSo we got those applied.\n\n88\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.880\nRight?\nAnd we could just use the default ones and\n\n89\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.570\nnever change them.\n\n90\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.510\nBut the reason we wanna do that is we\nwant to go separate time for show.\n\n91\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.000\nWe want our NTP server as a minimum.\n\n92\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.031\nWe want an email relay for\nevents and recording, and so on.\n\n93\n00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.511\nSome of those things will\ngo into the system policy.\n\n94\n00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:38.360\nDidn't make a lot of changes in\nthe health policy, but that's up to you.\n\n95\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.850\nYou can go through there and take a look.\n\n96\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.580\nSo let's go over here back to policies,\n\n97\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.530\nand we're gonna see that first we did\nour file policy yesterday, all right?\n\n98\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.405\nAnd we'll go through and\nwe'll play with that today, and\n\n99\n00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:52.821\nwe'll see some malware events\nbecause of this file policy, right?\n\n100\n00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:57.130\nNow let's come over here and say,\nwhat do I do with my Snort rules?\n\n101\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.290\nDo I need an IPS policy?\n\n102\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.526\nWell not necessarily,\nI can just do an access control policy but\n\n103\n00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:05.751\nthen you just have a like an access list,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:08.200\nSo we're not getting the full\nvalue of this product.\n\n105\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.270\nSo at an minimum you might not have a file\npolicy because you didn't buy your mail\n\n106\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.260\norder license but you have to buy your\nprotect and control or IPS license.\n\n107\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.500\nNow remember when I\nwent through licensing,\n\n108\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.000\nI told you guys something very important\nand that was when you buy the product and\n\n109\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.270\nyour talking to your sales rep,\nor whatever it is.\n\n110\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.031\nAnd they go ahead and say, okay yeah,\nyou want your 55 with Firepower.\n\n111\n00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:33.000\nGreat, don't forget to click and\nsay, and I need that IPS license.\n\n112\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.568\nNow if you buy malware URL\nthat's a separate line item and\n\n113\n00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:40.731\nthat's costs a thousand dollars a year,\nright thereabouts, but\n\n114\n00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:45.730\nthe IPS license is free, but it is a\nseparate line item, so don't forget that.\n\n115\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.699\nAll right,\n>> If you were to do that, Todd,\n\n116\n00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.930\nif you were to just get the IPS piece and\nthen not.\n\n117\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.490\n>> The subscription side,\nit would basically be more of\n\n118\n00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.360\na manual configuration at that point,\nyou'd have to tell it stuff to block?\n\n119\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.820\nOr would it still get\nsome basic information?\n\n120\n00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.070\nIt's still got, basically it's\nwhere I'm at right now today,\n\n121\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.720\nall I would do is create in here and\ncreate my IPS policy,\n\n122\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.190\nmy access control policy, and\nI have customers that just do that.\n\n123\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.505\nThey don't care about the file and\nthey don't care about the URL filtering,\n\n124\n00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:11.670\nthey don't care about the extra stuff,\nall they wanted was basic snort.\n\n125\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.340\n>> Okay, so\nthere is still some value in doing that.\n\n126\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.130\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Excellent.\n\n127\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.660\n>> Absolutely.\n\n128\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.530\nThis is definitely something\nyou can do it this way.\n\n129\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.870\nNow if you can and the malware license,\nI think is kinda important,\n\n130\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.593\nbut maybe they had these customers had\nother ways to track their malware,\n\n131\n00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:30.140\nI guess so, all right.\n\n132\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.760\nSo let's go ahead and we're gonna\nclick on Intrusion Policy here.\n\n133\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.880\nAnd notice I'm creating this policy.\n\n134\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.300\nRemember, I'm not creating\nit on the devices right now.\n\n135\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.770\nI'm creating it on the defense center.\n\n136\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.280\nI could have created all of this.\n\n137\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.320\nAll of my policies, system and health and.\n\n138\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.160\nSet up my updates and\nall this stuff to re-occur automatically.\n\n139\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.830\nAnd all this could have configured\neverything, added my device,\n\n140\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.260\npushed out my access control policy,\nand went to happy hour.\n\n141\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.906\nRight, it's done, right?\nSo a lot of times that's what I'll do is,\n\n142\n00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:57.180\nI'll set up everything in advance.\n\n143\n00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.400\nThen add my devices and\njust bang, bang, bang, it's done.\n\n144\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.710\nAll right.\n\n145\n00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.550\nIn this case here we\ndon't have an IPS policy.\n\n146\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.090\nSo cuz remember we just bought this\nout of the box right, falsely.\n\n147\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.330\nBrought this outside the box and installed\nfirepower on it so were good to go.\n\n148\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.020\nAnd word license.\n\n149\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.490\nRight again, that's not something that can\ncome back to you, you gotta do it right\n\n150\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.670\naway and I highly recommend you do\nthat before you add to your devices.\n\n151\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.270\nWe don't have to.\n\n152\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.778\nOkay, so I'm gonna call this,\nwe're working on pods one and two, right?\n\n153\n00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:30.820\nSo what I have work on pods three and\nfour today as well.\n\n154\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.650\nBut basically we set\nup two pods yesterday.\n\n155\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.290\nOne we installed from ground up,\n\n156\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.690\none we got out of the box that already had\nmalware, I'm sorry, firepower on there.\n\n157\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.081\n>> We've already loaded our malware.\n\n158\n00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:44.170\n>> We've got our malware loaded and\nready to go.\n\n159\n00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.927\nSo I'm gonna say Pod 1 & 2 IPS Policy.\n\n160\n00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:54.174\nNow let's say you sit there and\ngo aah man, there's just so much to this.\n\n161\n00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:55.659\nThis is just too hard.\n\n162\n00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:57.006\nWell, I'm gonna show you how.\n\n163\n00:07:57.006 --> 00:08:00.455\nWithout really doing much work, and\nyou don't even have to understand this,\n\n164\n00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:01.721\nyou could just make it work.\n\n165\n00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:06.760\nYou can create an IPS policy and implement\nit, and give yourself some security.\n\n166\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.940\nYou won't understand it completely but\nit will work.\n\n167\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.880\nAnd here's how we do that.\n\n168\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.320\nSo for example, take a look here.\n\n169\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.840\nI have two things,\nI have what's called a base policy.\n\n170\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.030\nSo these are source\nfire authored policies.\n\n171\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.867\nAnd you typically choose one of these,\nyou don't have to,\n\n172\n00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.640\nbut I would highly suggest doing it.\n\n173\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.643\nNow, notice the default is saying,\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n174\n00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:29.250\nmake some suggestions and give you\nbalanced connectivity and security.\n\n175\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.599\nThat means we're going to enable what\nwe think are important rules today and\n\n176\n00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:33.919\nsend you updates based on that and\n\n177\n00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.810\nwe're going to disable rules that\nwe don't think are important today.\n\n178\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.904\nAnd the reason we don't just go in and\ndisable or enable all of them- and hey,\n\n179\n00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:43.630\nsometimes I do, when I'm doing a lab,\nI'm like, hey, enable 25,000 start rules.\n\n180\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.867\nNothing's going to pass through and\neverything's gonna go really slow for\n\n181\n00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:50.990\nsure, I mean,\nthe processing is just really intense.\n\n182\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.154\nBut right here,\nwe're saying, bounce it and\n\n183\n00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.009\ndon't give me a lot of overhead, right?\n\n184\n00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:02.450\nNow, notice we can say, well,\nmy base policy is no rules active.\n\n185\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.950\nThat's fine, that means I have to go and\nenable them and turn on what I want.\n\n186\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.390\nSome people use this.\n\n187\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.720\nThe one that I like to do,\nespecially for class and for\n\n188\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.940\ndemos and so is give me the most\ncalled security over connectivity,\n\n189\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.630\nthis is gonna enable the most rules right?\n\n190\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.620\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n191\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.200\nSo, I can go here and now here's\nan interesting button right here.\n\n192\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.420\nSo this is an IPS policy, remember I\ncan create multiple IPS policies and\n\n193\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.790\nput them in the Access Control Policy.\n\n194\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.240\nI can only apply one Access Control Policy\nto any type of managed device and\n\n195\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.920\nI can have multiple file policies and\ntheir multiple IPS policies and so\n\n196\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.100\non and that's how I implement them\nwithin my Single Access Control Policy.\n\n197\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.220\nOkay, so when I say drop it inline,\nwhat I'm saying is,\n\n198\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.710\nif it's a Snort rule and\nit's set to drop an alert.\n\n199\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.300\nIn other words, we're saying hey this is\na Chrome Buffer Overflow, I see those\n\n200\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.220\nkinda a lot and so, if it's a drop an\nalert were saying hey, drop that traffic.\n\n201\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.610\nThat's not a bad thing,\nthat's a good thing, guys.\n\n202\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.600\nDo we click this or not?\n\n203\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.874\nThe answer is, if you don't click this,\nyou're just a passive IPS,\n\n204\n00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:10.220\na monitor only IPS,\nyou're not doing anything.\n\n205\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.421\nYou're seeing the events,\nyou're seeing that they drop, but\n\n206\n00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:15.560\nthey don't drop the traffic, all right?\n\n207\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.600\nSo we're gonna leave this off for now,\nand I'll explain why in a second.\n\n208\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.760\nLet me go ahead and say create and\nedit Edit policy because this is gonna\n\n209\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.940\ntake a second to go ahead and say, I did\nthe base policy of security connectivity.\n\n210\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.618\nIt takes a couple minutes to say,\nwell what rules do I want active?\n\n211\n00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:32.056\nWhat rules do I want not active?\n\n212\n00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:35.376\nWhat rules do I want drop and alerted?\n\n213\n00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:38.046\nWhich ones do I just want to load on and\nwhich ones are disabled?\n\n214\n00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:42.809\nWe can see that this is gonna take just\na couple seconds here To go ahead based on\n\n215\n00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.849\nmy base policy.\n\n216\n00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:50.300\nNow, I don't have to do anything else,\nI now have an IPS policy.\n\n217\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.652\nIt's a source by authored policy,\nit's a good policy, and\n\n218\n00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:56.360\npretty much we'll go ahead and\njust apply this.\n\n219\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.548\nBut I want to spend a little bit more time\nshowing you some stuff, basically how to\n\n220\n00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:04.630\nmanipulate some Snort rules, and why\nwould I want to manipulate Snort rules?\n\n221\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.354\nWell the answer is, when I get to events,\nwhen I show you events today and\n\n222\n00:11:09.354 --> 00:11:13.240\nwe do event analysis,\nreally that's what we do everyday.\n\n223\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.360\nAnd our job is to find out, is this\na problem or is this a false positive?\n\n224\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.280\nIf it's a false positive,\n\n225\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.440\nthen I'm gonna go to the Snort rules and\njust do something with it.\n\n226\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.770\nI'm gonna threshold it or\nsuppress it, or I'm gonna disable it.\n\n227\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.170\nRight depending on what my needs are and\nwhat I seize.\n\n228\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.970\nSo we'll talk about those\nthings here in a second.\n\n229\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.190\nAs soon as this get's done here.\n\n230\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.750\nHey we're cooking, we're in microwave but\nwe're still cooking.\n\n231\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.130\nWe're not in the Easy-Bake Oven.\n\n232\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.240\n>> You did mention in some of the earlier\nepisodes that working with Firepower it's\n\n233\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.351\nvery powerful, thus the name, it's very\nflexible But you can't be in a hurry,\n\n234\n00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:46.480\nI think you've said that more than once.\n\n235\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.130\n>> Yes.\n\n236\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.130\n>> You just have to be patient for\na lot of this stuff.\n\n237\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.812\n>> Yes.\n\n238\n00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:52.490\nOnce you, a lot of times will go ahead and\nsay, okay,\n\n239\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.820\nI've got my file policy done, my\nIPS Policy, put my access control policy,\n\n240\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.730\nI'm gonna push this out to two devices.\n\n241\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.380\nI push that out and I go for\na cup of coffee, all right,\n\n242\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.270\nbecause you sit here and watch it,\nit gets a little frustrated and anxious,\n\n243\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.820\nand so the best thing to do it just\nlet it go out, push those policies and\n\n244\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.630\nthen, even in this case here,\njust can't be in a hurry guys, I'm sorry.\n\n245\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.080\n>> And I guess if you think about it,\nwhat we're really doing is running a Linux\n\n246\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.180\nvirtual machine on top of our ASA or\neven the appliance does it right?\n\n247\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.160\n>> That's right. [CROSSTALK] >> Too right?\n\n248\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.473\n>> That's absolutely right.\nAnd then Snort turn in\n\n249\n00:12:23.473 --> 00:12:25.240\ninside that right,so all right?\n\n250\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.690\nSo, let's take a a look\nhere on what we have.\n\n251\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.383\nFirst off, since I did Security Over\nConnectivity, it came up and says,\n\n252\n00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:36.470\nwell this policy has 7,204 enabled rules\nwhich a lot of them is set to drop.\n\n253\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.460\nNow I can come over and\nclick on the rules if I come over here and\n\n254\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.480\nsay This is all the Snort rules.\n\n255\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.430\nI can click on those and just enable\nthem all, and I do that just for\n\n256\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.280\nfun sometimes, just to generate a lot\nof events and boy does it, right?\n\n257\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.290\nAnyways, notice the drop\nwhile inline is off.\n\n258\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.380\nWell I highly recommend turning this off,\nI know that sounds really weird.\n\n259\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.830\nBut when you're gonna go out,\nbecause I'm sitting there saying hey,\n\n260\n00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.390\nyou're not dropping any traffic.\n\n261\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.600\nIf you see something bad and\nit alerts on a Snort rules trigger it's\n\n262\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.370\nnot going to drop the traffic and\nit should.\n\n263\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.420\nThe answer is that is absolutely true so\n\n264\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.290\nwe are going to click this but\nnot at first.\n\n265\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.350\nSo, I am going to go ahead and\ncreate my policy.\n\n266\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.340\nI'm going to play with this awhile and\nget everything tuned the way I want it and\n\n267\n00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.620\nthen I'm going to implement it.\n\n268\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.930\nAnd I'm going to leave that button off.\n\n269\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.980\nThen I'm going to see I'm going to\ncome back look at the events and\n\n270\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.760\nsee what kind of events I'm getting.\n\n271\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.730\nAnd then I'm going to tune them.\n\n272\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.710\nThis is where our Snort tuning\nanalysis comes in and we say,\n\n273\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.020\nif this is a false positive,\nwhat do I want it to do.\n\n274\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.020\nSo I'm gonna suppress\nthe threshold of whatever.\n\n275\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.520\nAnd the fact is, once I get it and\nunderstand it and\n\n276\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.470\nI make sure that I know what\ntraffic's gonna be dropped and\n\n277\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.640\nwhat's gonna go through, and\nthat's the way I want it tuned.\n\n278\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.370\nI come back and I fine tune my IPS policy.\n\n279\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.620\nNow I come back here and\nnow I say drop while inline.\n\n280\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.405\nNow your phone will ring.\n\n281\n00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:52.807\n[LAUGH] But the basis is that we're\ntaking out the false positives and\n\n282\n00:13:52.807 --> 00:13:54.930\nwe're letting good traffic go,\nnot bad traffic, right?\n\n283\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.801\n>> And that's part of that learning\nprocess that we really have to get through\n\n284\n00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:00.430\nanyway.\n\n285\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.620\nCuz everybody's network is\na little bit different,\n\n286\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.950\nand I don't know about you, Todd,\nit might be different for you.\n\n287\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.720\nBut for me, no matter how well you plan,\n\n288\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.430\nit seems like there's always at least\none thing that slips through the cracks.\n\n289\n00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.028\nA communication that somebody\njust forget to tell you about, or\n\n290\n00:14:14.028 --> 00:14:15.530\nusually it's poor documentation.\n\n291\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.090\nThey just didn't know,\nand then it gets blocked.\n\n292\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.280\nSo this is how we get a chance to see\nthat before we actually break it.\n\n293\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.190\n>> Absolutely, we get to see\neverything that's gonna occur\n\n294\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.540\n>> Before it actually occurs, and\n\n295\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.930\nit's acting like it occurred, where\nour events are showing us it occurred,\n\n296\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.160\nbut we know that it didn't.\n\n297\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.700\nSo in this case here,\nI'm gonna come up here and\n\n298\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.130\nnotice this triangle and basically this is\nsaying, 'Hey you have an IPS policy and\n\n299\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.190\nit's, and we need to update it, we need to\ncommit the changes to it, and we haven't.\n\n300\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.500\nAnd that's all this triangle means.\n\n301\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.250\nSo I put that on, so\nas soon as I clicked this it says,\n\n302\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.680\nhey you made a change,\nsince I committed this.\n\n303\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.700\nNow if I was to change this, and this\ndoes take a second guys so bear with me,\n\n304\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.040\nand I say, let's do, right now we look and\nwe have 7000 rules with 6900 set to drop,\n\n305\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.740\nand I say, well maybe I want to do\nconnectivity over security because my\n\n306\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.280\ncompany wants some security, but\nboy do they like their throughput, so\n\n307\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.280\nif I click on this it automatically\nwill change, this would have\n\n308\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.420\ngone into a triangle at this point right\nnow if I hadn't done something else.\n\n309\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.480\nBut the fact is this takes a couple of\nminutes and you are going to come here and\n\n310\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.230\nsee which SNORT rules are enabled,\nwhich ones are disabled, and\n\n311\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.910\nnotice how many less, we only have 851\nrules enabled with 832 sets to draw.\n\n312\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.690\nSee there's a huge difference there,\nright?\n\n313\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.020\nI'm not a big fan of very few SNORT rules,\nyou have to have some or\n\n314\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.330\ndon't even create this.\n\n315\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.527\nSo you know, you can balance this and\nthen balance security and\n\n316\n00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:40.931\nconnectivity will be somewhere in between\nthere right, so we'll go over security and\n\n317\n00:15:40.931 --> 00:15:45.124\nconnectivity, and we'll go ahead and\nchange this will take a little bit longer.\n\n318\n00:15:45.124 --> 00:15:49.842\nNotice that last one came back relatively\nquickly because there was only about 800\n\n319\n00:15:49.842 --> 00:15:54.250\nrules, where this one has almost\n8,000 rules, or just over 7,000.\n\n320\n00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.642\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\ntake a look at.\n\n321\n00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:57.966\nWhat these rules are.\n\n322\n00:15:57.966 --> 00:16:02.597\nSo the first thing I can do is\nI'm gonna click on Rules up here.\n\n323\n00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:06.230\nAnd then we'll come down to these other\nones here, and we'll talk about all this.\n\n324\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.330\nSo, I understand this is gonna\nget a little in depth guys.\n\n325\n00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.902\nSo just bear with me, and hang with me,\nand I'll do it as simply as I can.\n\n326\n00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:15.630\nSo here's all of the rules, and\nwe'll see how many there are.\n\n327\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.550\nIt takes a few seconds cuz there's about\n22,000 to 25,000 depending on the device\n\n328\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.159\nand when was your last update.\n\n329\n00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:25.788\nAnd in this case here its a new one so\nI can find out how many there are and\n\n330\n00:16:25.788 --> 00:16:29.355\nI can enable all of them so you come\nup here this is the generator id and\n\n331\n00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:32.191\nthe snort id right here so\nthis is the snort rule here.\n\n332\n00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:36.093\nYou know, so these 28,000 or\nsomething these are not as old of rules.\n\n333\n00:16:36.093 --> 00:16:38.792\nYou'll see something in the hundreds or\nthe two hundreds.\n\n334\n00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:40.337\nYou know that,\nman those are some old rules.\n\n335\n00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:41.114\nRight?\n\n336\n00:16:41.114 --> 00:16:43.630\nAnyways, so if I click on this right here.\n\n337\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.394\nIt's gonna tell me, man you've got 22,000.\n\n338\n00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:49.817\nAnd I can come in here and I can say yes,\nand I want to enable all 22,000.\n\n339\n00:16:49.817 --> 00:16:51.696\nDon't do this in production,\nmy friends, if you're non-production.\n\n340\n00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:57.026\nAnd I'm gonna come in here to rules\nstate and I say you know what?\n\n341\n00:16:57.026 --> 00:16:58.672\nI want everything that matches\nanything to do with any of\n\n342\n00:16:58.672 --> 00:16:59.835\nthese 22,000 plus store rules.\n\n343\n00:16:59.835 --> 00:17:03.991\nAnd if you see one that match it, they're\nall gonna drop and generate events.\n\n344\n00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:07.675\nYou would do that because you're lonely\nand their phone's not ringing enough.\n\n345\n00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:08.616\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n346\n00:17:08.616 --> 00:17:12.276\nnow notice what I'm gonna do here,\nthis is called the rule accordium,\n\n347\n00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:14.171\nwe'll come back to that in a second.\n\n348\n00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:17.713\nBut over here I can go ahead and\nsearch through snort rules.\n\n349\n00:17:17.713 --> 00:17:21.276\nLet's say, we'll take a look at some\nMicrosoft stuff here that I end up working\n\n350\n00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:24.254\na lot because Microsoft sends out,\nhey here's a vulnerability,\n\n351\n00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:25.282\nyou need to get fixed!\n\n352\n00:17:25.282 --> 00:17:28.567\nBut anyways, we come in here and\nsay show me all the rules for\n\n353\n00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:33.128\nsort rules that have something to do with\nFTP, I'll just pick on something here.\n\n354\n00:17:33.128 --> 00:17:36.440\nNotice we have some rules,\nthere's 242 rules right now.\n\n355\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.520\nSome of them did drop and\nsome of them, this one's enabled and\n\n356\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.420\nit's just gonna generate events.\n\n357\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.080\nThis is gonna drop and generate events.\n\n358\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.080\nAnd this one here is just disabled,\nthese are disabled here.\n\n359\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.610\nLack DNS request for no malware domain,\nand maybe you want to enable that.\n\n360\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.850\nYou can come through and pick on those.\n\n361\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.020\nListen, we're getting very picky and\nyou know,\n\n362\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.160\nthis is because you got nothing else to do\nso hey, let's play with some snort rules.\n\n363\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.475\nYou don't have to go to this\nlevel to make this work.\n\n364\n00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:06.815\nBut why I would go to this level is\nbecause I'm getting false positives and\n\n365\n00:18:06.815 --> 00:18:08.497\nI want to tune them, right?\n\n366\n00:18:08.497 --> 00:18:11.120\nSo, or there's a Zero-Day attack and\nsomething came out.\n\n367\n00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.300\nOr Microsoft put out a new patch and\nI want to make sure I have that.\n\n368\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.910\nThose are the reasons you\nwould do something like this.\n\n369\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:17.990\nSo let me take a look here.\n\n370\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.500\nAnd let's say I have a couple here.\n\n371\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.307\nAnd I'll look at these and I'll say\nyou know what I'm seeing something on\n\n372\n00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:29.955\nthe Internet that hey this is an old rule,\nor it's been out for a few years, and\n\n373\n00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:33.281\nit's in the news someone's been using it,\nwhatever.\n\n374\n00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:36.132\nSo I'm gonna say I want to, when I get\nthese I don't know if I wanna drop them\n\n375\n00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:38.875\ncuz I don't know if they're bad, but\nlet me at least generate events.\n\n376\n00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:42.529\nSo I could have right-clicked over\nhere and generated events, or\n\n377\n00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:44.494\nI went up there and did it from here.\n\n378\n00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:48.410\nEither way now these are enabled rules.\n\n379\n00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.210\nSo they're not gonna do anything, but\nthey are gonna look in your event log\n\n380\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.830\nthat this happened, and\nwe spent a lot of time in our event log.\n\n381\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.234\nAll right so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at one of these.\n\n382\n00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:04.131\nAnd I want to look a bit more right now\nand let's talk about this in detail so,\n\n383\n00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:09.293\nlet me come over to here and\nthis is a different pod that I configured\n\n384\n00:19:09.293 --> 00:19:13.557\nlast night and did some attacks on and\nstuff like that.\n\n385\n00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:17.448\nIt's kind of like we got this\none back out of the oven again.\n\n386\n00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:18.987\nIt was even cooked even more.\n\n387\n00:19:18.987 --> 00:19:19.776\nIt's the perfect meal, right?\n\n388\n00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:21.890\nSeven course meal here.\n\n389\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.240\nAnyway, so, I'm going to come over\nhere to, let me do CTRL+ here so\n\n390\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.090\nwe can see this a little bit more.\n\n391\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.960\nAnalysis, and just a second here for\nit to catch up.\n\n392\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.481\nConnection events.\n\n393\n00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:36.282\nRight?\n\n394\n00:19:36.282 --> 00:19:37.361\nThis should have some events here.\n\n395\n00:19:37.361 --> 00:19:38.685\nNow I want to show you something.\n\n396\n00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:40.205\nWhen we're looking for\nevents, if nothing shows up.\n\n397\n00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:42.320\nAnd nothing is showing up here.\n\n398\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.639\nAnd I did know that some events were\nin there or something's coming through.\n\n399\n00:19:45.639 --> 00:19:48.814\nYou need to be aware of the clock and\nwhat it's doing.\n\n400\n00:19:48.814 --> 00:19:52.585\nIt's only looking in the last hour and I'd\ngotten up like at five this morning and\n\n401\n00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:55.091\nwas doing attacks so\nthat was you know a few hours ago.\n\n402\n00:19:55.091 --> 00:20:00.609\nSo I'm going to come back here and\nI'm going to click on this.\n\n403\n00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:05.928\nAnd this, basically I'm changing\nthe time is going to show me for\n\n404\n00:20:05.928 --> 00:20:08.550\nmy clock, and it's, come on.\n\n405\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.980\nThis guy's unhappy.\n\n406\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.159\nDoesn't like that CTRL + on here.\n\n407\n00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:14.676\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're doing the last 59 minutes, so\n\n408\n00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:18.244\nif I go to six hours, I probably\nshould see something here, right?\n\n409\n00:20:18.244 --> 00:20:20.260\nAnd so,\npay attention to this guy over here.\n\n410\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.474\nIf you're not seeing events, or\nyou're looking for a certain thing.\n\n411\n00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:23.233\nI can change,\n\n412\n00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:27.167\nand say, well I want to see something\nout of this specific period of time.\n\n413\n00:20:27.167 --> 00:20:30.258\nI wanna go back a week,\nI wanna do whatever.\n\n414\n00:20:30.258 --> 00:20:35.999\n[LAUGH] Should have seen something here.\n\n415\n00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:36.997\n>> All right.\n>> Course I didn't.\n\n416\n00:20:36.997 --> 00:20:37.636\n>> Maybe you got up\nearlier than you thought.\n\n417\n00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.169\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think I did.\n\n418\n00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:40.039\n>> The old time zone change.\n\n419\n00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:42.233\n>> Yeah, yeah exactly.\n\n420\n00:20:42.233 --> 00:20:46.420\n>> I think for most people this is,\nconnecting to the Internet,\n\n421\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.829\nyou pretty much expect to at least see\nrandom scans or whatever pretty early on.\n\n422\n00:20:51.829 --> 00:20:54.223\n>> Well it depends on the sort rules,\nwhat you have enabled, and\n\n423\n00:20:54.223 --> 00:20:57.280\nwhat connection events because by default\nyou're not going to see anything.\n\n424\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.168\nOkay so, one of the things you guys have\nto look at when you get to the access\n\n425\n00:21:00.168 --> 00:21:03.059\ncontrol policy I'll remind you of this\nthere is no logging on by default on\n\n426\n00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:03.590\nthis block.\n\n427\n00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.760\nSo you're not gonna see squat.\n\n428\n00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.550\nSo you need to make sure enable\nlogging on everything that you do.\n\n429\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.284\nSo when we get to the black list it'll\nsay, hey if something hits the black list\n\n430\n00:21:14.284 --> 00:21:18.687\nand it's the Cisco author object we\nwant to see an event on that, right?\n\n431\n00:21:18.687 --> 00:21:22.497\nAnd so, we can see here, an event and\nI'm sitting there saying, okay,\n\n432\n00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:24.319\nthis is a false positive, right?\n\n433\n00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:28.290\nAnd so, I know this is coming from R.D.,\nthose guys are up to some shenanigans\n\n434\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.800\nagain but\nit's not really causing any problems.\n\n435\n00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.673\nI can just click on this and\nfind out more information\n\n436\n00:21:35.673 --> 00:21:40.341\nabout this host hopefully\nin some sort of period.\n\n437\n00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.060\nAnd we'll go through this,\nit's called an indication of compromise.\n\n438\n00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.639\nThe idea guys, is that when you see\nan event, and we'll get through this,\n\n439\n00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:49.434\nis you need to go out and\ndetermine the event and fix the event.\n\n440\n00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:53.343\nIn other words, I'm going to come out\nhere and I'm going to find out what's\n\n441\n00:21:53.343 --> 00:21:57.455\nwrong with this host, why it did that and\nthen I'm gonna come back here and say.\n\n442\n00:21:57.455 --> 00:21:58.349\nOh, and by the way I fixed it.\n\n443\n00:21:58.349 --> 00:21:59.916\nAll right?\n\n444\n00:21:59.916 --> 00:22:03.353\nOur events, our context explorers,\nwe'll go through later, should be empty.\n\n445\n00:22:03.353 --> 00:22:06.359\nBecause we're working on it all the time,\nwe're fine tuning in it.\n\n446\n00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.695\nAnd this has to do with sort rules.\n\n447\n00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:10.398\nSo this is a sort rule that we say hey,\nI'm looking at this and\n\n448\n00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:11.618\nit's triggering on this.\n\n449\n00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:12.675\nAnd this is saying that it's bad.\n\n450\n00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:15.599\nThen we're going to go and\nsay, and I know it's not.\n\n451\n00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:19.784\nI can go to that sort rule, search on\nit and suppress it, or threshold it.\n\n452\n00:22:19.784 --> 00:22:21.699\nWe'll take a look at it that now.\n\n453\n00:22:21.699 --> 00:22:25.389\n>> Now when you do that, is it mostly to\nhelp avoid, if you have other security\n\n454\n00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:28.920\nofficers or whatever that are also\ntroubleshooting the same problem.\n\n455\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.254\nThen you stop people from\nstepping on each other's feet, or\n\n456\n00:22:31.254 --> 00:22:33.875\nis it more just to let the system\nknow that it's getting corrected?\n\n457\n00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:34.513\n>> Yeah, basically.\n\n458\n00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:36.649\nSo, if we're looking at the screen,\nhere, I'm seeing this.\n\n459\n00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:40.852\nI got a few attacks here, I don't,\nI'm noticing that when I'm looking for\n\n460\n00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:42.238\nthe last hour and stuff.\n\n461\n00:22:42.238 --> 00:22:43.259\nI go back, last day that I've been\nplaying with this and reload this.\n\n462\n00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:45.198\nWe'll see when I did my attacks.\n\n463\n00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:48.113\nBut the fact is, is, you know,\nI'm looking at this.\n\n464\n00:22:48.113 --> 00:22:50.170\nThis is what my network should look like.\n\n465\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.740\nThis should actually be empty,\nor thereabouts.\n\n466\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.320\nRight?\n\n467\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.300\nI'm looking at this.\n\n468\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.680\nI'm gonna click on this.\n\n469\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.940\nAnd I'm gonna drill into analysis and\nfind out why this is here.\n\n470\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.850\nAnd I'm gonna say oh, that's good.\n\n471\n00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.820\nAnd every time I see that then I\nknow it's an attack on the server or\n\n472\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.510\ngoing to a host.\n\n473\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.280\nI need to send someone out\nthere to fix that problem.\n\n474\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.210\nOr I need to create a sort rule\nto stop this from coming in,\n\n475\n00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.380\nor enable a sort rule.\n\n476\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.720\nOne thing or the other, I should\nhave this screen relatively empty.\n\n477\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.790\nIt should be relatively small.\n\n478\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.924\nNot looking like my big demo pod here.\n\n479\n00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:26.666\nWhen you see something like this, man I\ndon't know, I'd probably just resign and\n\n480\n00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:30.086\nsay, look I'm going to get another job\nbecause this is going to take forever\n\n481\n00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:30.849\nto fix, right?\n\n482\n00:23:30.849 --> 00:23:33.067\nBut, we basically got to go in here and\nfix all of these problems, right?\n\n483\n00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:34.587\nAnd, figure out what's going on.\n\n484\n00:23:34.587 --> 00:23:38.383\nSo, this is when maybe people\nin the class go, oh man, right?\n\n485\n00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.773\nBecause this can be a lot of work.\n\n486\n00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:45.507\nSo, now we're going to go come back here\nto our sort rules and we say, oh okay, so,\n\n487\n00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:48.348\nhere's the sort rule,\nit's coming from R & D and\n\n488\n00:23:48.348 --> 00:23:51.580\nit's giving me these errors\non my contacts explorer.\n\n489\n00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.691\nI see this a lot.\nThis is why I'm bringing this up.\n\n490\n00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:56.166\nMost the time within\na company I see attacks,\n\n491\n00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:58.846\nhalf of them just are people\ndoing normal stuff.\n\n492\n00:23:58.846 --> 00:24:02.430\nAnd we've got to go in and tell this\nsystem like, it's cool, let it go.\n\n493\n00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.250\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick this and I'm gonna change,\n\n494\n00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.340\nthe rules state at this point here.\n\n495\n00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.835\nWe're gonna generate events but\nI'm not gonna drop anything.\n\n496\n00:24:08.835 --> 00:24:11.990\nBut, I can do something\ncalled event filtering.\n\n497\n00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.110\nAnd there's some different things here.\n\n498\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.080\nSo, there's threshold and suppression.\n\n499\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.460\nAll right, so thresholding is saying like,\nhey don't give me as many events.\n\n500\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.420\nRight, I want to see events, but\nI'm getting 1000 of them a minute,\n\n501\n00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.560\nright, because it's happening a lot.\n\n502\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.400\nI get it, there's a problem.\n\n503\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.030\nI working on it.\n\n504\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.730\nI don't want to see it all the time.\n\n505\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.330\nThe other, the suppression, and we'll take\na look at both of these is saying, no,\n\n506\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.430\nif it's coming from RND in this example,\nthen I don't wanna see any events at all.\n\n507\n00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.340\nRight?\nSo, I wanna keep it active,\n\n508\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.880\nif the problem comes from somebody else,\n\n509\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.370\nbut it was coming from RND don't even\nlet me know, cuz I know it's fine.\n\n510\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.850\nLet's take a look at threshold,\nthere's two things here.\n\n511\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.380\nFirst off, the type is,\nwe could limit where we could threshold.\n\n512\n00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.590\nIn other words, let's limit\nthe amount we're getting, right?\n\n513\n00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.740\nSo, I'm saying hey look,\nI know this is a problem.\n\n514\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.280\nAnd typically, we track by source.\n\n515\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.580\nThe problems usually\ncome in from some source.\n\n516\n00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.810\nAnd we're saying, hey,\nthis source is being a thorn.\n\n517\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.040\nAnd I understand it's a problem.\n\n518\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.550\nAgain, we're working on it.\n\n519\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.460\nBut I'm getting so many connection events,\nI can't see if I'm having any\n\n520\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.940\nother problems cuz this is\njust overflowing everything.\n\n521\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.680\nSo, let me limit this,\nI'm gonna limit by source.\n\n522\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.480\nI'm gonna say listen,\nif I get five events.\n\n523\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.748\nOnly give me 5 events in 60 seconds,\nall right.\n\n524\n00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:23.339\nSo, I'm gonna suppress this and say,\nI don't care how many events occur,\n\n525\n00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:24.200\nI only wanna see at five.\n\n526\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.240\nOr maybe, you say,\nevery 60 seconds, give me one.\n\n527\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.181\nSo, I know that at least\nthat one occurred right.\n\n528\n00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:32.940\nIt's probably more like a thousand or\nwhatever.\n\n529\n00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.720\nSo, if this was occurring and you're\nsuppressing, and you're limiting this.\n\n530\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.970\nSorry.\nSo I am going to say five and 60 seconds.\n\n531\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.270\nI'm going to set this limit here,\nfor five and 60 seconds.\n\n532\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.460\nNow, before I go ahead and set this,\nthere's something else we can go\n\n533\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.119\nthrough and say, well we can limit,\nor we can threshold it.\n\n534\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.580\nAnd this is saying I need, this is\ndifferent because what this says is,\n\n535\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:03.170\nI need to get five events in 60\nseconds for you to send me an event.\n\n536\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.450\nSo, you see the difference?\n\n537\n00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:09.150\nSo, on the limit it says don't give\nme more than five before 60 seconds.\n\n538\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.290\nThis one says,\nI have to have five within 60 seconds.\n\n539\n00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.975\nIt's very possible that I use this one\nat times, because I'm saying, hey,\n\n540\n00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:20.321\nsometimes a smart rule triggers and\nit's not the end of the world, but\n\n541\n00:26:20.321 --> 00:26:24.232\nif I'm getting a lot of them, then maybe\nI'm going to consider it coming to the end\n\n542\n00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:26.076\nof the world and I need to work on this.\n\n543\n00:26:26.076 --> 00:26:29.097\nIn this case, here I'm saying,\nlook if I get five in 60 seconds,\n\n544\n00:26:29.097 --> 00:26:30.370\nthen maybe it's an attack.\n\n545\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:35.770\nIf I just get one in 60 seconds,\nthen maybe it's not a big deal, right?\n\n546\n00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.550\nMaybe, it just happened, right?\n\n547\n00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.470\nSo, tell me if i'm getting a lot where\nnow, I know I have to focus on this.\n\n548\n00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.110\nBut, maybe we can do something better.\n\n549\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.190\nSo, maybe I can come in here and\nsay, really?\n\n550\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.730\nI want to do both.\n\n551\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.051\nRight?\nI'm going to say,\n\n552\n00:26:48.051 --> 00:26:51.890\nI have to have at least five\nof events in 60 seconds.\n\n553\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.700\nFor me to get one of that.\n\n554\n00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:59.540\nSo, if I see three events,\nI know I had up to 19 possible events\n\n555\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.090\nthat possibly occurred, but\nI only see three events in six seconds.\n\n556\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.240\nSo, we could maybe use both or\nthreshold or limit.\n\n557\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.498\nI'm just gonna use them both here.\n\n558\n00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:13.170\nAnd now, we'll see that there's\na filter set up, right?\n\n559\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.880\nSo, we have our threshold,\nand in this case here,\n\n560\n00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.520\nwhat happened is we're saying, look we\nwant to threshold it, so they have to give\n\n561\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.850\nme at least five events in 60 seconds, but\nthey're only going to show it to me once.\n\n562\n00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.930\nAnd, so it also limits the amount of\nevents that I get, so if I'm barely\n\n563\n00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.253\ngetting, if I'm hardly getting any events,\non that rule I'm not gonna get anything.\n\n564\n00:27:37.253 --> 00:27:40.640\nRight?\nSo, we're doing a little bit of both here.\n\n565\n00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.440\nAnd this is helping me bring down\nthe amount of events that I'm seeing.\n\n566\n00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.650\nAnd if I do see it, I know it's extremely\nimportant because it met my limits and\n\n567\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.640\nthresholds, right?\n\n568\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.490\n>> Would that be effective for\nthings like a denial of service where you\n\n569\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.000\nmight expect a certain level\nof traffic that's okay, but\n\n570\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.640\nthen when it goes over that's\nthe indicator you're getting a flood.\n\n571\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.310\n>> Yeah, this would be great I'd probably\nset this limit a little bit higher,\n\n572\n00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.720\nsomething like that.\n\n573\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.595\nIn this case here, if I'm seeing\nten in 60 seconds when I typically\n\n574\n00:28:06.595 --> 00:28:08.962\nmight only see one as an anomaly.\n\n575\n00:28:08.962 --> 00:28:11.922\nThis trigger sort rule is not\nalways the end of the world, but\n\n576\n00:28:11.922 --> 00:28:14.780\nif I'm seeing it triggered\na lot then it could be, right?\n\n577\n00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.440\nAnd that's how this will\nhelp us understand it.\n\n578\n00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.870\nCuz if I get something now\nbased on the limit and\n\n579\n00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:23.800\nthreshold that we set, now I know that\nhey, I really need to take a look at this.\n\n580\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.590\nBecause it exceeded my threshold and\nmy limits.\n\n581\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:31.438\nSo, and so, the snort rule I thought was\nfine before, but now, it meets this.\n\n582\n00:28:31.438 --> 00:28:33.020\nI know I need to go take a look at it.\n\n583\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.690\nSo, there's something else though\nthat's really relatively cool.\n\n584\n00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.430\nAnd this is called Dynamic State.\n\n585\n00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.890\nI like this one very much because\nwhat happens is I'm gonna\n\n586\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.660\ntake this same rule that seems\nto be kinda of a thorn for me.\n\n587\n00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.720\nAnd I'm gonna limit it, I'm gonna\nthreshold it, and I'm doing both and\n\n588\n00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.540\nI'm gonna do Dynamic State.\n\n589\n00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.930\nWhat Dynamic State does, it says,\n\n590\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:00.467\nif I have fraught Track By Source,\nand it's coming from,\n\n591\n00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:06.134\nI could just say my outside network or\nsomething like that.\n\n592\n00:29:06.134 --> 00:29:07.769\nWhich I know is this.\n\n593\n00:29:07.769 --> 00:29:13.450\nAnd I'm gonna say if I get five,\nif I get five events\n\n594\n00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:18.751\nin 60 seconds I'm going\nto change this rule.\n\n595\n00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:20.660\nRight now, it's just to generate event.\n\n596\n00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.020\nSo, I'm thresholding it, and\nI'm venting it and I'm saying,\n\n597\n00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.230\nif it meets past this threshold\nthat means past this limit, then,\n\n598\n00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.410\nwhat I want to do is change this rule.\n\n599\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:37.480\nSo, not only am I saying hey,\nalert me if it gets past my thresholds and\n\n600\n00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.730\nmy suppressions but also change the rule\nto now drop and generate event.\n\n601\n00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.930\nBut wait, we're only gonna do it for,\nsay 5 minutes.\n\n602\n00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.710\nBecause maybe it comes in it's attack,\nI am going to drop and generate events.\n\n603\n00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.320\nThen, the next one is we come\nin we see a couple events,\n\n604\n00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.800\nwe know they're not an attack it's\nfine it's not meeting my threshold, so\n\n605\n00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.220\nwe are going to enable this\nrule to generate events.\n\n606\n00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.570\nThis is relatively cool my friends.\n\n607\n00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.780\nI can go in there and\nset a rule that says,\n\n608\n00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.470\nokay you trigger every once in a while.\n\n609\n00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:10.160\nIt's not a big deal, some anomaly that's\nhappening with some version of Firefox or\n\n610\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.560\nsomething like that,\nI see something like that a lot.\n\n611\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.610\nNow, if I see it a whole lot coming in and\nit exceeds my thresholds, now I can\n\n612\n00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:22.480\nsit here and say, now I want to change\nthat rule to now drop and generate events.\n\n613\n00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.880\nBut only for five minutes.\n\n614\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.910\nOkay?\nAnd then, if it happens again,\n\n615\n00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.450\nthen we'll start dropping it again for\nfive minutes and so on.\n\n616\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.631\nBut it will set it back to just\ngenerate events after five minutes.\n\n617\n00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.710\nSo, that's kind of cool, isn't it?\n\n618\n00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.628\nVery cool.\n\n619\n00:30:34.628 --> 00:30:37.441\n[LAUGH] So, now we have this here,\n\n620\n00:30:37.441 --> 00:30:42.370\nwe have our suppressions, and\nwe have our Dynamic state.\n\n621\n00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.640\nI can also set up some alerting.\n\n622\n00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.500\nI won't do it because\nI don't have my SMNP.\n\n623\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.380\nI don't, SMNP to me,\nI would rather do Syslog,\n\n624\n00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.450\ngives us so much more information right.\n\n625\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.160\nSMNP is very limited in the kind\nof information we can get today.\n\n626\n00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.260\nSo, CIS log is good in this case here but,\nwe can still send an SNMP alert and\n\n627\n00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.940\nnotice I set one there but\nI have to enable to make this work,\n\n628\n00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.160\nI have to have an SNMP enabled\non this device which I don't.\n\n629\n00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.910\nSo, if I click here,\nit's even given an explanation point,\n\n630\n00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.240\nit says, hey you can put me here, but\n\n631\n00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.300\nthe minute you try to save your pulse,\nI'm going to give you an error.\n\n632\n00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:14.840\nHaha.\nRight.\n\n633\n00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.940\nSo, I'm going to come here and\nremove that.\n\n634\n00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.120\nNow, the one thing I would\ndo is force these comments.\n\n635\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.650\nRemember when we saw in the system policy\nwhere we said, hey man, when someone goes\n\n636\n00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.250\nout there and changes an IPS rule or\nsome other sort of policy, make sure that\n\n637\n00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:33.450\ncomment that they have to put is is why\nthey changed that rule and it's mandatory.\n\n638\n00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.510\nYou can't save a policy\nwithout put in a comment.\n\n639\n00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.050\nAnd this is where it would be done.\n\n640\n00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.909\nSo, I'm gonna say okay to this and here,\nif I had set that system policy and\n\n641\n00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:44.379\nforce that,\nthat say IPS policy rule updates.\n\n642\n00:31:44.379 --> 00:31:48.233\nForce the comments, then I would\ntry to save this at this point.\n\n643\n00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:50.741\nIt would give me an error saying no,no no,\nyou got to put a comment in, right?\n\n644\n00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:53.853\nSo, in here I'm just gonna go and\nadd a real comment.\n\n645\n00:31:53.853 --> 00:31:55.873\nAnd first off,\nI don't have to put my name.\n\n646\n00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:59.305\n[LAUGH] But, notice I'm logged in\nas Admin so that might be bad.\n\n647\n00:31:59.305 --> 00:32:01.466\nThis is why we're going\nto get to users today and\n\n648\n00:32:01.466 --> 00:32:03.369\nwhy we don't have people log in as Admin.\n\n649\n00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:06.119\nWe have them log in as their name so\nwe can keep track of who they are and\n\n650\n00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:07.392\nwill give me the date and time.\n\n651\n00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:13.690\nChange because it was a noisy rule.\n\n652\n00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.717\nRight?\nAnd so we suppress it and threshold it and\n\n653\n00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:18.371\nso on.\n\n654\n00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.972\n>> And those comments, they're extremely\nimportant if we have more than one\n\n655\n00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.420\nEngineer working in this-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n656\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.990\n>> Right?\nIt does get confusing.\n\n657\n00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.965\n>> Yeah.\nSo, when I come in here I look at this,\n\n658\n00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:29.576\nsaw the rule and went out there and I saw\nin context explored and I go out there and\n\n659\n00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:30.724\nI saw a comment on there,\n\n660\n00:32:30.724 --> 00:32:34.960\nI'll know why they changed it hopefully\nthey'll put something good in there.\n\n661\n00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.030\nAll right, so that's all great and\ngood and we can save this and move on, but\n\n662\n00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.540\nwait, we're not done.\n\n663\n00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.510\nAll right, so we've got some other things,\n\n664\n00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.540\nlet's take a look at what's\ncalled this rule accordion now.\n\n665\n00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.020\nI should've kind have closed that up and\nlooked at it like this, but\n\n666\n00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.840\nnonetheless, this is just another\nway to filter and look at traffic.\n\n667\n00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.270\nOne of the things I can do, and\n\n668\n00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.500\nagain, we're still looking\nat just FTP data, right?\n\n669\n00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.240\nFTP rules.\n\n670\n00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.100\nCome in here to the rule configuration and\nI can come in here to rule state.\n\n671\n00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.850\nAnd basically the rule state,\nI can say show me all the rules and\n\n672\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.220\nI'm looking at FTP here, that are just\nset to drop and generate events.\n\n673\n00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.970\nSo, I'm saying hey, show me\nthe rule states that are just this.\n\n674\n00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.210\nNow, it's going to tell me there's\n46 of them and here they are.\n\n675\n00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.150\nNow, I come here and\nsay hey I'm getting false positives and\n\n676\n00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:23.800\nI can just click on this and change it\nright here or click on it down here and\n\n677\n00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.850\nchange it up here it doesn't matter.\n\n678\n00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:31.800\nBut this is based the rule just says\nshow me the ones that I want to see.\n\n679\n00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:39.100\nAnd notice that my filter bar up\nhere changed to FTP state drop and\n\n680\n00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:39.920\ngenerator events.\n\n681\n00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.287\nBecause now I'm looking at FTP and\nI'm looking at state, drop and\n\n682\n00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.826\ngenerator events so right,\nI can clear this out.\n\n683\n00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.860\nNow, notice I don't see my,\nI was looking into FTP.\n\n684\n00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.370\nI don't see that here anymore.\n\n685\n00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.305\nHowever, now before I come back down here\nI'm gonna come back to this and talk to\n\n686\n00:33:57.305 --> 00:34:01.321\nyou more about this cuz rule accordion is\nhelpful and it's gonna be good for you.\n\n687\n00:34:01.321 --> 00:34:04.065\nBut I wanna come over here now,\nand I wanna show you something.\n\n688\n00:34:04.065 --> 00:34:08.996\nSo, under the advance, this is what got\nmoved in the newest code, in the 5-4,\n\n689\n00:34:08.996 --> 00:34:10.435\nand in the 6-0 code.\n\n690\n00:34:10.435 --> 00:34:13.715\nThis has gotten moved into a new\npolicy called network analysis.\n\n691\n00:34:13.715 --> 00:34:16.245\nIt was here, it was done,\neverything was in one place.\n\n692\n00:34:16.245 --> 00:34:18.525\nI thought it was very convenient but\nthey moved it.\n\n693\n00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:21.369\nI'm sure they're very smart people,\nI'm sure they had great reasons.\n\n694\n00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:26.254\nSo, there's something\ncalled policy layers.\n\n695\n00:34:26.254 --> 00:34:27.825\nAnd so I'm going to come back\nto this screen, don't forget.\n\n696\n00:34:27.825 --> 00:34:30.800\nBut nonetheless, on my policy layers here.\n\n697\n00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.580\nI'm gonna click on these and\nthis is gonna show me my IPS Policy and\n\n698\n00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.490\nthe IPS Policy is done in layers.\n\n699\n00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.767\nSo, I basically have my base layer,\n\n700\n00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:41.373\nremember we set this up with\nsecurity over connectivity.\n\n701\n00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:44.673\nSo, again I didn't have to have\nany of the layers on this and\n\n702\n00:34:44.673 --> 00:34:48.435\nthen what happens if I ever make\nany changes it doesn't go in there,\n\n703\n00:34:48.435 --> 00:34:51.260\nit goes into what's called\nthe my changes layer.\n\n704\n00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.710\nAnd that's built in here.\n\n705\n00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.038\nNow, why is this important to understand?\n\n706\n00:34:55.038 --> 00:34:59.370\nBecause I combine my base layer with the\nchanges that I make and here's my policy\n\n707\n00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.990\nsummary, this is the actual policy\nthat I'll create this is it up here.\n\n708\n00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.520\nRight?\nSo, we can see that I have my changes\n\n709\n00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.320\nlayer here,\nI've changed two rules to generate events,\n\n710\n00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.890\nthat's all I've done really is just\nsuppress and threshold them and so on.\n\n711\n00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.840\nAnd if we look in here,\n\n712\n00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.690\nwe'll see those changes in here if I\ncome in here and look at the rules.\n\n713\n00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.850\nOkay, so now one of the reasons that\nwe create layers is I can create.\n\n714\n00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.660\nI can add a layer here or\nadd a shared layer and\n\n715\n00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.682\nwhy I would do this is I\nwould take my base layers and\n\n716\n00:35:26.682 --> 00:35:31.660\nthen I would create an IPS shared layer\nand I would base it on my company.\n\n717\n00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.340\nHey, here's the foundation that I want,\nthese are things that I want changed.\n\n718\n00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.540\nNow, I can share that layer\nwith other IPS policies.\n\n719\n00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.460\nThen, so instead of me creating this for\nevery single IPS policy that I create\n\n720\n00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.640\nacross the board here on my defense\ncenter, I create it once and\n\n721\n00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.560\nI can share it within\nall the other policies.\n\n722\n00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.020\nSo, then I can tweak the My Changes\njust for that one and\n\n723\n00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.950\nhave foundation for IPS policies.\n\n724\n00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.630\nNow I can make changes all the time,\nright?\n\n725\n00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.070\nI use the same ones over and over and\n\n726\n00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.570\nthen tweak the My Changes layer\non a per policy IPS basis.\n\n727\n00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.640\nThen, I come up here and\ncreate my policy summary, so\n\n728\n00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.420\nthat's why we create multiple\nlayers in there, right?\n\n729\n00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.110\nSo, we can create layers for flexibility.\n\n730\n00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.620\nNow, I'm not going to do that here,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n731\n00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.750\ntake a look at the rules here.\n\n732\n00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.950\nThis is under the My Changes rules and\n\n733\n00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.020\nwe can see that all of these rules here,\nthat they're yellow.\n\n734\n00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.790\nAnd what this means is they are active or\n\n735\n00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:32.250\nthe rules or configured below this layer.\n\n736\n00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.480\nSo, I'm in the My Changes layer\nwhere I would make changes,\n\n737\n00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.890\nI can't make any of the changes but\nin the My Changes layer.\n\n738\n00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.640\nSo, when I was up here making changes,\nit actually made changes here.\n\n739\n00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.490\nSo, if I come down here of security or\nconnectivity notice they're not gonna be\n\n740\n00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.530\nyellow, they're all gonna be white\nbecause this is where they take effect.\n\n741\n00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.600\nThis is where they're configured.\n\n742\n00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.790\nSo, when I make changes up here,\nthey're saying here,\n\n743\n00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.640\nnow watch this if I type in FTP, we'll\nfind our rules that we just played with.\n\n744\n00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640\nAnd there they are right there.\n\n745\n00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.840\nNow, they're white because they\nour on the my changes layers.\n\n746\n00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.230\nThis is where I change them.\n\n747\n00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.840\nRight?\nSo,\n\n748\n00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.380\nI can see all of my information\nthat I just configured here.\n\n749\n00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.220\nIt's not necessarily that important but\nit's just an idea of hey,\n\n750\n00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.500\nwhere was this layer configured?\n\n751\n00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.300\nWe're going to add another\nlayer in here later once we\n\n752\n00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.390\nconfigure our network discovery policy.\n\n753\n00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.180\n>> Now, if there's a conflict,\nis it just a higher layer that wins?\n\n754\n00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.640\nOr is there an order to it?\n\n755\n00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.371\n>> Yes, there's no such thing as conflict\nbecause the higher layer always wins.\n\n756\n00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:26.871\n>> Okay.\n>> Yes.\n\n757\n00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:28.410\nSo, no matter what I did here,\n\n758\n00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.290\nthe bottom layers are like,\nBut hey, well I blocked that!\n\n759\n00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:31.780\nWhere we're like, Oh, well.\n\n760\n00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.580\nTough, right?\n\n761\n00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.620\nSo, we got the control,\nwho's ever the highest layer wins.\n\n762\n00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.640\nThat's the way it goes.\n\n763\n00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.420\nSo, it's hierarchical.\n\n764\n00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.205\nSo, let's come back here for\na second to this rule accordion.\n\n765\n00:37:42.205 --> 00:37:45.020\nThis thing's helpful to look for things.\n\n766\n00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.710\nI'll come in here and look for\nMicrosoft stuff, here let me show you.\n\n767\n00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.141\nSo, when you come down here\nto Microsoft Vulnerabilities.\n\n768\n00:37:50.141 --> 00:37:53.060\nAll right, and\nI can come down here and say, Hey,\n\n769\n00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.550\nI was reading something about something\nand I was just doing one the other day,\n\n770\n00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.520\nand I'm going to try to\ngo down to that one.\n\n771\n00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.120\nYeah, thirteen-forty-two.\n\n772\n00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.793\nI think it was forty-one.\n\n773\n00:38:06.793 --> 00:38:08.930\nAll right.\nSo, I was seeing this.\n\n774\n00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.220\nOh, and now, this didn't come up.\n\n775\n00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.915\nAnd it showed me nothing, why?\n\n776\n00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:15.940\nCuz, I didn't clear my filter bar and\nI still have FTP in there didn't I?\n\n777\n00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.390\nSo, I'm gonna come over here and\nclear my filter bar and\n\n778\n00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.270\nnotice we'll see our vulnerabilities here.\n\n779\n00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.000\nAnd I now I wanna set here and\nsay hey man, all of this here,\n\n780\n00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.230\nI've heard they're really bad for\nbasically whatever operating system or\n\n781\n00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.550\nbrowser I'm working on my system.\n\n782\n00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:31.670\nSo, I'm gonna click on this and\nI don't wanna click on all of those.\n\n783\n00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.170\nI thought I was clicking on this guy here.\n\n784\n00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.000\nOkay.\nI had to reclick on that, and\n\n785\n00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.040\nnow I've got my 11 results.\n\n786\n00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.900\nAnd I'm gonna say, hey,\n\n787\n00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.930\nthese are all bad and I'm gonna set\nthese to drop and generate events.\n\n788\n00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.600\nAnd I'm gonna pick on that one Microsoft\nvulnerability and that's fine.\n\n789\n00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.750\nAnd the reason that I've gone out and\ndone this for\n\n790\n00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.570\ncustomers is a lot of times it has to do\nwith the browser version that they use and\n\n791\n00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.000\nthey're seeing vulnerabilities.\n\n792\n00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.280\nAnd, a lot times I'll go out there and\nsay, no these are fine.\n\n793\n00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.950\nThey're showing up as vulnerabilities\nin here, and they're not so\n\n794\n00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.370\nI'll disable the actual rules,\nsomething like that.\n\n795\n00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.460\nTake out those noisy rules so\n\n796\n00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.180\nwe're not getting all these events\nthat aren't real, all right?\n\n797\n00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.790\nThat's really kind of\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n798\n00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.370\nNow, we come down here and\nwe can do platform specific.\n\n799\n00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.490\nBut, the other thing I wanna show\nyou here is the the rule update.\n\n800\n00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.390\nThe rule update, this is the last\ntime the rule was updated.\n\n801\n00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.490\nAnd remember we just installed this.\n\n802\n00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.080\nSo, we're gonna come back and\nwe will do rule updates.\n\n803\n00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.770\nNow, I'm not gonna sit here and\nstart that because one of the problems is,\n\n804\n00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.330\nI can't really do much else on this\nwhile I'm doing a rule update.\n\n805\n00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.290\nIt kind of takes precedence.\n\n806\n00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.060\nSo, that's not something we\nwanna wanna do right now.\n\n807\n00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.012\nBut we don't want to do this,\nbut when I do do this,\n\n808\n00:39:31.012 --> 00:39:35.810\nI'm gonna see the latest Snort rule update\nand you want to get these because they're\n\n809\n00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.230\nchanging rules every day based\non attacks that are occurring.\n\n810\n00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.511\nAnd so, we can see, hey what's changed\nin this one, since the last one?\n\n811\n00:39:42.511 --> 00:39:44.313\nRight?\nAnd again, not seeing anything,\n\n812\n00:39:44.313 --> 00:39:48.154\nbecause you can see that my filter bar\nis pretty full right here, isn't it?\n\n813\n00:39:48.154 --> 00:39:48.990\nGet rid of this.\n\n814\n00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.340\nSo, I'm gonna say that's\nwhat has changed and\n\n815\n00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.820\nit's showing me All\nthe rules that have changed.\n\n816\n00:39:53.820 --> 00:40:00.070\nSo if I click on here it should show me\nwhat has changed since the last time.\n\n817\n00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.070\nAgain, I had to go back and\nchange my, so nothing has changed.\n\n818\n00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.910\nAnd I'll say what is new.\n\n819\n00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.645\nAnd now we can see what is\nnew since that last update.\n\n820\n00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:10.925\nThis will tell me if I click on this.\n\n821\n00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:12.390\nSo let me get rid of this.\n\n822\n00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.280\nGotta keep that filter bar clear\n\n823\n00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.510\nit get's a little hard,and this\nwill tell me these are what's new.\n\n824\n00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.900\nNow these are all my rules,\nbecause I haven't had an update so\n\n825\n00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.770\nthey're basically saying hey since\nyou installed this 22,000 rules.\n\n826\n00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.140\nThose are all your new ones, and\nby the way nothing's changed right?\n\n827\n00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.950\nSo when we get a new rule update you\ncan come in here and see what's new and\n\n828\n00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.430\nchanged and so on.\n\n829\n00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.750\nAll right, so now we've made some changes.\n\n830\n00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.300\nI went out there, and\nI could do something,\n\n831\n00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.380\nlike it doesn't matter if I click\nthe rules here, or click the rules here.\n\n832\n00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.152\nI'm really changing them here.\n\n833\n00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:47.657\nSo it really doesn't matter\nif you change them here,\n\n834\n00:40:47.657 --> 00:40:51.164\nthey're like, it's like the summary\nof your policy of all the rules, but\n\n835\n00:40:51.164 --> 00:40:53.890\nthe changes have to be\nmade in my changes layer.\n\n836\n00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.970\nSo, I'm gonna click this and\nget rid of that filter bar.\n\n837\n00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.790\nAnd I click in the rules,\nand I'm going to say,\n\n838\n00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.735\neveryone uses Chrome,\nit helps if you spell it right, Chrome.\n\n839\n00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:09.352\n[LAUGH] You know what,\nmy keyboard is all jacked up.\n\n840\n00:41:12.765 --> 00:41:13.730\nHuh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n841\n00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.610\n>> With all the various\n\n842\n00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.602\nnetwork issues that we could have,\nit ends up being a keyboard issue.\n\n843\n00:41:18.602 --> 00:41:19.628\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'll say.\n\n844\n00:41:19.628 --> 00:41:20.606\nAll right, we got Firefox.\n\n845\n00:41:20.606 --> 00:41:22.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like, show me some Firefox.\n\n846\n00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.790\nWe're gonna pretend it's Firefox, cuz I\ndon't know what happened to my keyboard.\n\n847\n00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.880\nBut nonetheless, I'm gonna come in here\nand say, look, we use a lot of Firefox.\n\n848\n00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.420\nAnd again, I see these problems too\ncuz people use different versions.\n\n849\n00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.410\nNow what you really should do is,\nonce we get our FireSIGHT data and\n\n850\n00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.120\ntells me all my users.\n\n851\n00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.010\nI should go search on the users, find out\nwhat version of Firefox they're using.\n\n852\n00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.370\nMake a trouble, take it with a knock.\n\n853\n00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.290\nAnd say, hey, you know, Bob in sales and\nSally in finance, whatever it is.\n\n854\n00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.717\nBased on our LDAP information that we\ngot from FireSIGHT, we can go out and\n\n855\n00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:50.943\ntell them what version\nof Firefox their using.\n\n856\n00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:54.350\nAnd hey, they need to go update it\nbecause they have a vulnerability.\n\n857\n00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.090\nRight.\nThat's the power of this product.\n\n858\n00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.630\nIn this case here I'm gonna say,\nhey, you know what.\n\n859\n00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.150\nWe're using this.\nI'm gonna set this to disabled because\n\n860\n00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.780\nwe're not really have any problems\nhere and all false positive.\n\n861\n00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.770\nSo now, I'm not gonna say\ntype in Firefox and do this.\n\n862\n00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:12.131\nThis is kind of a generic,\nbig thing that I'm doing.\n\n863\n00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:14.922\nYou might wanna pick on a couple of\nthem that you know aren't problems and\n\n864\n00:42:14.922 --> 00:42:16.310\nyou're getting false positives.\n\n865\n00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.514\nIn this case here,\nI kinda picked on them all, didn't I?\n\n866\n00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:20.768\nThought I did.\n\n867\n00:42:22.904 --> 00:42:24.225\nOkay, yeah.\n\n868\n00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:30.045\nSo now I came over here and\nI was like hey I can't click on this.\n\n869\n00:42:30.045 --> 00:42:32.074\nWhy?\nBecause I'm not in a layer I can change.\n\n870\n00:42:32.074 --> 00:42:34.489\nI'm in the base layer,\nI can't screw with that one, right?\n\n871\n00:42:34.489 --> 00:42:39.040\nSo I'm gonna come up here, go up to\nFirefox, and see they're all from below.\n\n872\n00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.122\nSo I'm gonna click on them here,\nand I'm gonna say disable.\n\n873\n00:42:43.122 --> 00:42:46.320\nI can inherit from above If they\nwere sent from above and say,\n\n874\n00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.716\ninherit that process but,\nthat's not what we're going to do.\n\n875\n00:42:49.716 --> 00:42:52.410\nOkay, so we said 172 rules to disable.\n\n876\n00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:57.570\nI'm not saying to go and\nbroadly disable all Firefox snort rules.\n\n877\n00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.441\nThat's extremely dangerous.\n\n878\n00:42:58.441 --> 00:43:00.942\nYou find one,\nyou find it's not a vulnerability.\n\n879\n00:43:00.942 --> 00:43:03.000\nAnd you're like, it's fine for\nmy network, just an example.\n\n880\n00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.300\nAll right, now, once I find all my stuff\nand I get everything that I want done.\n\n881\n00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.820\nAnd then, so I've got my policy layers.\n\n882\n00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.630\nAgain, if I click here,\nnow we can say hey, look.\n\n883\n00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.020\nHere's my base layer,\nhere's what I changed and\n\n884\n00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.970\nthat combines to create\nmy IPS policy here.\n\n885\n00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.541\nAll right, so I'm gonna come up here to.\n\n886\n00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:23.963\nWe will come back to this\nFireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n887\n00:43:23.963 --> 00:43:28.044\nAgain, I mention this to you, until we\ncreate our Network Discovery policy which\n\n888\n00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:31.712\nI can't do until I finish creating my\nnetwork and transferring my data and\n\n889\n00:43:31.712 --> 00:43:33.270\nI get quality FireSIGHT data.\n\n890\n00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.922\nNow I can come in and say, hey Mr.\n\n891\n00:43:34.922 --> 00:43:37.766\nFireSIGHT you're a very\npowerful passive technology.\n\n892\n00:43:37.766 --> 00:43:39.421\nTell me what you think of my network and\n\n893\n00:43:39.421 --> 00:43:41.610\nwhat new rules we should set to drop and\ndisable.\n\n894\n00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:42.461\nRight, okay, so.\n\n895\n00:43:42.461 --> 00:43:44.368\nSo i'm gonna click this right here and\nsay.\n\n896\n00:43:44.368 --> 00:43:48.689\nOkay, you can now browse 7,000 and\nwe'll drop one line here.\n\n897\n00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:52.102\nAgain, if this is the first time I'm\nsetting up that policy i probably wouldn't\n\n898\n00:43:52.102 --> 00:43:53.618\ndo that, i would give it a few days.\n\n899\n00:43:53.618 --> 00:43:57.218\nSee what's gonna occur because of this,\nmake sure,\n\n900\n00:43:57.218 --> 00:44:01.010\nbut in this case here we\nwanna drop the mats right?\n\n901\n00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.750\nNow there's a there's something\ndown here this is interesting.\n\n902\n00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.090\nWe will come back to this but\n\n903\n00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:07.920\nnotice it says this probably\ncontains enable pre processor rules.\n\n904\n00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.768\nPre processor are before the snort rules,\nand\n\n905\n00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:14.050\nit tells basically snort\nhow to read the rules.\n\n906\n00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.540\nIt normalizes the headers and\n\n907\n00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.090\ntells us, does this come from another\npatchy server or an ii server?.\n\n908\n00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.890\nHow should we read this\ndata left to right ?.\n\n909\n00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:21.490\nRight to left?\n\n910\n00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.492\nWhatever.\nPre processing is very important.\n\n911\n00:44:23.492 --> 00:44:27.230\nHowever, a lot of them are disabled by\ndefault because they are very noisy and\n\n912\n00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.565\nthey can generate alerts.\n\n913\n00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:33.445\nSo, basically what this is saying, what\nyou did is say we need some pre-processors\n\n914\n00:44:33.445 --> 00:44:35.590\nworking to be able to read that data.\n\n915\n00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.605\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nenable them, that's what this does.\n\n916\n00:44:41.134 --> 00:44:42.543\nOkay.\nDescription of changes.\n\n917\n00:44:42.543 --> 00:44:43.607\nRemember, it's optional.\n\n918\n00:44:43.607 --> 00:44:46.044\nIn this case here,\nI could make it mandatory and say,\n\n919\n00:44:46.044 --> 00:44:47.410\nhey what was I doing out here?\n\n920\n00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.197\nWhy was I changing this IP,\nthis snort policy, right.\n\n921\n00:44:52.797 --> 00:44:53.900\n>> And remember, as we tweak this.\n\n922\n00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:58.110\nThis is stuff that a lot of times will be\ndefined by our security policy, right.\n\n923\n00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.680\nThe paperwork side of the security.\n\n924\n00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.230\n>> It has to be.\n\n925\n00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.770\nIt has to be.\n\n926\n00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.430\n>> And so.\n\n927\n00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.290\nAgain these notes I,\na lot of times we skip them.\n\n928\n00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.010\nLike whatever notes who cares.\n\n929\n00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.592\nAnd, and if your the only tech\nmaybe that's, that's fine.\n\n930\n00:45:07.592 --> 00:45:10.216\nBut in most environments we need to\nbe tieing that to changes in our\n\n931\n00:45:10.216 --> 00:45:11.084\nsecurity policies.\n\n932\n00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:15.214\nSo we might be referencing things\nlike change management ticket number,\n\n933\n00:45:15.214 --> 00:45:16.885\nor something of that nature.\n\n934\n00:45:16.885 --> 00:45:19.450\nTo create that paper trail of\nwhy that change went in there.\n\n935\n00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.881\nYou could be weakening security\non your network, right, Todd?\n\n936\n00:45:21.881 --> 00:45:22.666\n>> Absolutely.\n\n937\n00:45:22.666 --> 00:45:26.480\nSo you know, and again some of the changes\nthat I made here are just for an example.\n\n938\n00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.160\nI'm not saying, hey follow this along-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n939\n00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.497\n>> During the production hour,\n\n940\n00:45:29.497 --> 00:45:30.570\nplease don't do that.\n\n941\n00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.965\nAgain, I'll go out there and\nfind a particular Chrome or\n\n942\n00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:38.140\nFirefox vulnerability that's showing\nup and I do one of two things but\n\n943\n00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.990\nI don't do the third thing,\nwhich is nothing.\n\n944\n00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.530\nI either send someone out\nthere to upgrade that browser.\n\n945\n00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.759\nBecause I see a lot of browser issues\ncome through here as vulnerabilities.\n\n946\n00:45:47.759 --> 00:45:49.106\nAnd maybe they're not vulnerabilities.\n\n947\n00:45:49.106 --> 00:45:52.425\nSo I'll either disable or\nsuppress that rule or I'll send someone,\n\n948\n00:45:52.425 --> 00:45:54.970\nI'll most likely send\nsomeone to upgrade it.\n\n949\n00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.350\nAnd I'm gonna mark that as resolved.\n\n950\n00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.110\nAnd then when I see it again, I'm like.\n\n951\n00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.228\nOh okay, let me find out why\nthis is still triggering.\n\n952\n00:46:00.228 --> 00:46:01.074\nRight?\n\n953\n00:46:01.074 --> 00:46:03.520\nAnd so that's what our goal is here.\n\n954\n00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.220\nSo what have we done here now?\n\n955\n00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.210\nSo we've created a file policy.\n\n956\n00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.160\nSo we're gonna stop now.\n\n957\n00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.560\nI think we stopped EXEs and\nPDFs and had some fun, and\n\n958\n00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.330\nwe stopped any Microsoft documents.\n\n959\n00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:17.600\nWe don't anyone sending us any work,\nso we stopped all Microsoft documents.\n\n960\n00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.570\nAnd now we've created an IPS policy.\n\n961\n00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.330\nWe can see, hey this is all great and\ngood, but just like our file policy,\n\n962\n00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.400\nthis isn't in use.\n\n963\n00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.921\nRight?\nSo, we're gonna finish up this section.\n\n964\n00:46:26.921 --> 00:46:28.175\nWe're gonna wrap this up.\n\n965\n00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:32.819\nAnd then we're gonna come back and\ndo the big kahuna of policies.\n\n966\n00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:34.352\nAnd, that's my access control policy.\n\n967\n00:46:34.352 --> 00:46:39.580\nBecause now I can push this out, and\nnow I'm blocking traffic, right?\n\n968\n00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.996\nAnd, typically, again, I would not have\nset drop while inline on that IPS policy\n\n969\n00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:46.373\nif it was the first time\nI was pushing it out.\n\n970\n00:46:46.373 --> 00:46:48.896\nCuz I want to see what's\ngonna happen when I do it.\n\n971\n00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:53.000\nOnce I see what happens and I tune it\nbased on the events that I'm getting.\n\n972\n00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.751\nAnd make sure it's like if I do see an\nevent, it's actually a true event that I\n\n973\n00:46:56.751 --> 00:46:59.315\nwant dropped or blocked, or\nI want to be alerted on.\n\n974\n00:46:59.315 --> 00:47:02.704\nAnd I suppress the ones that I want,\ndisable the ones that I want, or\n\n975\n00:47:02.704 --> 00:47:04.319\ngo out there and upgrade these.\n\n976\n00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:09.145\nSally's machine with the wrong browse\nFirefox version or Chrome version, or\n\n977\n00:47:09.145 --> 00:47:10.177\nwhatever it is.\n\n978\n00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:13.819\nAgain, the reason I mention it is,\nI see this a lot in production.\n\n979\n00:47:13.819 --> 00:47:18.168\nSo, this guy, this box here\nhates old versions of Firefox,\n\n980\n00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.972\nold versions of Chrome.\n\n981\n00:47:19.972 --> 00:47:21.775\nThere's a lot of\nvulnerabilities with those.\n\n982\n00:47:21.775 --> 00:47:24.650\nAnd we're going to see those and\npick those up right away.\n\n983\n00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.360\nOnce I get those all fixed,\nI'll drop them online.\n\n984\n00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.681\nBut, remember, when I do that,\nI have to now say my IPS policy.\n\n985\n00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:30.480\nAnd, what's that mean?\n\n986\n00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.140\nI have to update my access control policy\nthat it's in before it takes effect.\n\n987\n00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.070\nSo, that's it for\nright now with the IPS policies.\n\n988\n00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.467\nWe will come back to them because after\nwe do our access control policies.\n\n989\n00:47:40.467 --> 00:47:44.073\nThen we're gonna come back to our Network\nDiscovery policies to discover our network\n\n990\n00:47:44.073 --> 00:47:46.340\nand then go out and\nsay hey, Firefox, FireSIGHT.\n\n991\n00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.620\nI keep saying Firefox.\n\n992\n00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.439\nFireSIGHT, tell us what you think and\nhelp me make some suggestions.\n\n993\n00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:56.147\nAs a matter of fact, most people come\nhere and they pick a base policy.\n\n994\n00:47:56.147 --> 00:47:58.951\nSecurity Over Connectivity or\nBalance Connectivity and Security.\n\n995\n00:47:58.951 --> 00:48:03.787\nAnd then they just set up FireSite\nto update recommendations every week\n\n996\n00:48:03.787 --> 00:48:05.001\nautomatically.\n\n997\n00:48:05.001 --> 00:48:08.990\nAnd they don't do anything with stalt\nrules and that's an option for you.\n\n998\n00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.290\nRight, let me tell you something,\nit's better than you doing nothing.\n\n999\n00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:15.240\nIt absolutely will protect your network.\n\n1000\n00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.550\nA lot of times though for me.\n\n1001\n00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.231\nI'm always telling people\nwhen you see these alerts,\n\n1002\n00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.984\nyou got to do something about them.\n\n1003\n00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:23.858\nThey really shouldn't just be\nsitting on your screen, and\n\n1004\n00:48:23.858 --> 00:48:24.951\nyou're seeing all these alerts.\n\n1005\n00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:28.852\nSo, trash them, crush them,\ndisable them or fix the problem.\n\n1006\n00:48:28.852 --> 00:48:29.864\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1007\n00:48:29.864 --> 00:48:31.856\nGo out and stop this attack.\n\n1008\n00:48:31.856 --> 00:48:36.806\nThe whole idea is we're\nlooking at this and\n\n1009\n00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:39.565\nseeing these attacks.\n\n1010\n00:48:39.565 --> 00:48:41.469\nThere's a reason that they're showing up.\n\n1011\n00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:42.981\nAnd we need to know what it is, and\n\n1012\n00:48:42.981 --> 00:48:45.196\nwe need to know if we need\nto disable that rule, or\n\n1013\n00:48:45.196 --> 00:48:48.616\nif we need to do some other action,\nby sending someone inhouse to outside.\n\n1014\n00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:52.048\nOkay, so stick around my friends, and\nwe're gonna hit access control policies.\n\n1015\n00:48:52.048 --> 00:48:55.155\nI won't usurp your authority about\nclosing out a session, my friend.\n\n1016\n00:48:55.155 --> 00:48:57.658\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know, you are welcome to do it.\n\n1017\n00:48:57.658 --> 00:49:01.554\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\nI mean this is pretty exciting stuff.\n\n1018\n00:49:01.554 --> 00:49:03.563\nWe really do get a chance to see here the,\n\n1019\n00:49:03.563 --> 00:49:07.247\nthe power the flexibility all the\ndifference stuff we can do inside here.\n\n1020\n00:49:07.247 --> 00:49:10.354\nSo I'm personally excited\nto see this in action.\n\n1021\n00:49:10.354 --> 00:49:13.110\nAnd up and running and tying it all\ntogether into an access control policy.\n\n1022\n00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.120\nWhich is what's gonna be coming up next.\n\n1023\n00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.489\nYou definitely don't want to miss that.\n\n1024\n00:49:16.489 --> 00:49:19.536\nSo stay tuned.\nBut for now signing off for ITPROTV.\n\n1025\n00:49:19.536 --> 00:49:20.414\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n1026\n00:49:20.414 --> 00:49:22.360\n>> And I'm Todd Lammle.\n\n1027\n00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.960\n>> And we'll be back after this.\n\n1028\n00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:29.620\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.311\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:22.510\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Cisco FirePower,\n\n5\n00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.040\nand boy do we have an episode lined up for\nthis one.\n\n6\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.220\nWe're gonna be tackling\naccess control policies,\n\n7\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.000\nthe thing that we've probably mentioned\nin every single episode up until now.\n\n8\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.680\nBecause all the work we've done\nreally isn't active until we put it\n\n9\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.100\ntogether in that access control policy.\n\n10\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.420\nSo I've been just anxious\nwith anticipation all the way\n\n11\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.580\nup to this moment and\nhere all of our dreams will come true.\n\n12\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.560\nAnd here to, I know I'm setting\nthese really high standards and\n\n13\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.810\nhere to try to live up to this excitement,\n\n14\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.950\nwe've got Todd Lammle back back in\nthe studio with us, good luck Todd.\n\n15\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.630\n>> Love access control policies and\nit's a good thing and\n\n16\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.110\nI'll get all excited about them because.\n\n17\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.610\nNow, of course we did do our system\npolicy and our health policy and\n\n18\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.010\nthose were applied separately.\n\n19\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.750\nBut anything that's gonna\ngive us events on traffic for\n\n20\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.716\nfiles or something that generated or\n\n21\n00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.890\nalerted on a snort role is going to come\nfrom an access control policy now, irght?\n\n22\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.040\nSo lets go ahead and do something and\nwe'll generate some traffic right.\n\n23\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.940\nOkay so I'm going to come out here and\ncreate some generic control policy.\n\n24\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.640\nI just click policies and\nit takes my most left one here,\n\n25\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.170\nand its going to come up and\nwe have our default policy.\n\n26\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520\nWe know that that was there,\nit automatically applied to our box.\n\n27\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.260\nAnd we can go in and\ntake a look at it real quick and\n\n28\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.100\nsee that it doesn't do anything.\n\n29\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.970\nAnd it's not even up\nto date on both boxes.\n\n30\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.040\nThat's cuz I was playing with\nthe boxes and it was like, hey,\n\n31\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.920\nwell you need to reapply\nour access control policy.\n\n32\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.820\nI was like, why would I wanna\nreapply that access control policy,\n\n33\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.250\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n34\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.770\nSo let's go create a new policy.\n\n35\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.600\nAnd we're gonna start from the beginning.\n\n36\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.310\nAnd I'm just going to say the same thing.\n\n37\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.010\nPod 1 and 2 ACP, right?\n\n38\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.460\nNow there's a couple default\naction meaning that,\n\n39\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.750\nthink of again you're access control\npolicies is somewhat like an access list.\n\n40\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920\nWe start at the top and as soon as you\nmatch possibly your sense of the egress.\n\n41\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.050\nIf we trust traffic or you're dropped, or\nyou just might go down to the next rule.\n\n42\n00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.250\nSo the fact is is if I get through,\nthis whole access control policy,\n\n43\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.390\nwhat's gonna happen at the end?\n\n44\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.060\nAm I just going to block all traffic?\n\n45\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.650\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing,\n\n46\n00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.400\nbecause now I'm only allowing things\nthrough that I explicitly permit,\n\n47\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.420\nwhich sounds a lot like an access\ncontrol list at that point.\n\n48\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.830\nTypically, I'm gonna do\nsomething with IPS, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.380\nAnd say I want an IPS at the end, and\nwe're gonna go ahead and set that.\n\n50\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.950\nAnd again, I can change these.\n\n51\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.410\nAgain, now we're just\ndiscovering the network,\n\n52\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.110\nwe're not really changing anything,\nso I rarely, rarely have picked this.\n\n53\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.825\nNow, at this point here,\nI can click my targeting device.\n\n54\n00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.205\nI have a couple devices\non this defense center.\n\n55\n00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.715\nI say, I want the access control\npolicy to be part of this.\n\n56\n00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:54.085\nI can add these later,\nor I can add them now.\n\n57\n00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:54.965\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n58\n00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.595\nOkay so again, I could have,\nbefore I even added these devices,\n\n59\n00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.970\ncreated my system policy,\nhealth policy, file policy.\n\n60\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.100\nIPS policy, my access control policy, and\nthen when I actually added the device, and\n\n61\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.340\nit says, hey,\nyou gotta have an access control policy.\n\n62\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.990\nAdded that in.\n\n63\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.570\nBoom.\nI was done.\n\n64\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.510\nI'm done for the day.\n\n65\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.110\nI'm gone.\n\n66\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.058\nMy box is up and running.\n\n67\n00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:13.720\nBut let's take a look at this,\nthere's kind of a lot to this my friend.\n\n68\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.480\nSo just bear with me as we get\nthrough some of the details here\n\n69\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.220\nagain this is a very important policy.\n\n70\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.420\nAll right, now first thing we're going\nto do is we could create some rules.\n\n71\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.920\nNow it's the last thing I'm going to do,\n\n72\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.910\nbased on this access control policy\nis come in and create the rules.\n\n73\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.285\nThe first thing I'm gonna do though\nis come down to the bottom and\n\n74\n00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:31.665\nset my default action.\n\n75\n00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.735\nNotice I had set it to intrusion\nprevention, so it came back and\n\n76\n00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.355\ngave me a default and says hey, well let\nme give you an IPS rule at the bottom.\n\n77\n00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:42.185\nSo now I've got an IPS policy at\nthe bottom that's bound security and\n\n78\n00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:42.825\nprotection.\n\n79\n00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:46.915\nNow I can easily change this, and\nthey got some really cool stuff in here.\n\n80\n00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:47.665\nSo I could sit here and\n\n81\n00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:51.670\nsay security over connectivity, there's\ngot an experimental policy in here.\n\n82\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.580\nThey had one here that I see\nsometimes depending on the version.\n\n83\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.220\nWhat is it called?\n\n84\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.300\nMaximum detection, and\n\n85\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.850\nit's kind of like the magnum of\naccess control policies, right?\n\n86\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.830\nSo anyways, it was like, so I'm going to\nchoose connectivity over security here.\n\n87\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.935\nOr I could, I could just- you know,\nreally, I'm just gonna block all traffic.\n\n88\n00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:08.175\nWhy?\nBecause it's more fun that way.\n\n89\n00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:09.935\nThat way I get more events.\n\n90\n00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:12.865\nMy users might be more upset, but\nhey, I get a more colorful graph, for\n\n91\n00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:13.765\nsure, right?\n\n92\n00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.045\nAnd if I'm lonely,\nthe phone will definitely ring.\n\n93\n00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.945\nAll right, so.\nI'm gonna click, now, here's the deal.\n\n94\n00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:19.105\nNotice I clicked on the scroll.\n\n95\n00:04:19.105 --> 00:04:21.425\nLet me come back over here, and show you.\n\n96\n00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:24.285\nThere's a scroll here, and\nyou always need to pay attention to this.\n\n97\n00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:26.850\nWhen you're creating your access\ncontrol policies my friends,\n\n98\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.310\nalways think about logging,\nlogging how do I get events right?\n\n99\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.840\nYou're not going to get them if you\ndon't tell them to send you events.\n\n100\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.870\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do, is I\ndon't have to create any rules, I can just\n\n101\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.780\nhave this one here this default action\nof block all traffic And then log it.\n\n102\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.250\nThat would be kind of fun I guess.\n\n103\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.760\nNow we can't log at the end because\nsince we're blocking all traffic\n\n104\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.870\nthere is no end.\n\n105\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.480\nAll right, so we can send to a defense\ncenter or sys log, or as SMP trap.\n\n106\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.290\nI usually just send it to a defense\ncenter but you have that option here.\n\n107\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.420\nNow let's say okay,\nI've got the bottom one done, and\n\n108\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.520\nI think that's what I wanna do.\n\n109\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.070\nThis might be a little heavy for\n\n110\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.560\nyou in production, but you're gonna play\nwith the different policies that you want.\n\n111\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.880\nIf I do change this checks out,\nif I do change this and\n\n112\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.160\nsay security over connectivity,\nnotice it changes that variable.\n\n113\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.840\nThis dollar sign that we saw yesterday\nthat we were changing home net,\n\n114\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.700\nexternal net, and so on,\nwhen we were in our objects, right?\n\n115\n00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.370\nBecause this is saying I've\ngot an IPS policy here.\n\n116\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.000\nI'm just gonna leave, again, at block.\n\n117\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.590\nAnd, some people will set theirs to go,\nhey, if you get through my list,\n\n118\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.650\nyou get through my IPS policy,\nyou get through my file policy,\n\n119\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.390\nman you're pretty tough, so\nwe're gonna trust all traffic.\n\n120\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.190\nThat's certainly an option, here, right?\n\n121\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.480\nSo, it's kinda like to permit\nIPNENE on the access list right.\n\n122\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.050\nAnyways I'm not a big fan of permit\nIPNENE when it comes to source fire.\n\n123\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.680\nAll right,\nhere we would chose our targets.\n\n124\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and chose them now,\n\n125\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.330\nbecause I'm gonna put this on both of\nthem, so notice I pick both of them.\n\n126\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.230\nAgain I can create this policy without\n\n127\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.800\nputting anything at\nthe targets at this time.\n\n128\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.330\nBut when I'm done, I'm just gonna say save\nand apply and we know what it's gonna do.\n\n129\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.200\nOkay, now we're gonna go\nto a very important tab.\n\n130\n00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.850\nNow, of course, everything's very\nimportant, but in this case here,\n\n131\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.040\nwe certainly don't wanna\nskip security intelligence.\n\n132\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.410\nDoes anyone remember from yesterday\nwhat security intelligence is?\n\n133\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.890\nMaybe we can ask our host here.\n\n134\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.350\nDoes he remember what\nsecurity intelligence is?\n\n135\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.070\n>> Well, that's the information that\nwe're pulling from Cisco, right?\n\n136\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.140\nThe data they populate and\nsend to use as part of our subscription.\n\n137\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.870\n>> Which it is, but which data?\n\n138\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.853\nHe is absolutely correct, but he has\njust not quite finished defining it yet.\n\n139\n00:06:28.853 --> 00:06:32.110\n>> [LAUGH] But it is absolutely that,\nit is objects that are updated.\n\n140\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.330\nBut what are the objects,\nare global black and\n\n141\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.000\nwhite list, our global white and\nblack list.\n\n142\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.790\nSo if we take a look at this here,\nwe're saying here's my white list,\n\n143\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.750\nhere's my black list.\n\n144\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.260\nNow I can't add anything in here.\n\n145\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.650\nSo what I can do though,\nlet me open another screen here,\n\n146\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.330\na lot of times you guys, you can get\noff this screen relatively easy.\n\n147\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.691\nSo I'll say, I want to go events\nwhile I'm configuring this and\n\n148\n00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.280\nfind and IP address cuz I wanna\nadd to my blacklist, whatever.\n\n149\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.830\nSo I'm gonna say right-click, open,\nand new tab is what that says.\n\n150\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.831\nI know you probably couldn't\nread that cuz I know I couldn't.\n\n151\n00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:04.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm standing right here and\n\n152\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.460\nyou guys are like forever away.\n\n153\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.010\nSo I'm gonna open that in a new tab and\nhopefully, we saw that.\n\n154\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.320\nDid it take?\n\n155\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.190\nNo, I guess it did not.\n\n156\n00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.100\n>> It popped up in\nthe tab right next to it.\n\n157\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.350\nIt did not go all the way to the end.\n\n158\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:22.129\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] It is not\ngoing to let you get there.\n\n159\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:23.650\n>> I will just go from here\nto connections to events.\n\n160\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.570\nIt did not quite do what I wanted,\nbut it is fine.\n\n161\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.370\nAll right, in this case here I am\nseeing my connections and events, and\n\n162\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.650\nI can take an IP address.\n\n163\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.870\nNotice I see this guy here.\n\n164\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.630\n>> Not gonna do this, but\nnotice I can blacklist this now.\n\n165\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.590\nThis would immediately go into\nthat global blacklist and\n\n166\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.470\nit'll be blacklisted forever, immediately.\n\n167\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.990\nI don't have to update my\naccess control policy.\n\n168\n00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.160\nIt's immediately updated.\n\n169\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.210\nNow if I say global white list,\ncuz I'm saying, hey this guy's not bad.\n\n170\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.950\nHe's showing up in here.\n\n171\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.820\nTired of it showing up, I wanna fix this,\nhe's good and I white list it and\n\n172\n00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.850\nI still have to update my\naccess control policy.\n\n173\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.090\nNow if I go in there and\nsay, I made a mistake.\n\n174\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.670\nI didn't mean to blacklist the finance\nserver, cuz I didn't get my check, so\n\n175\n00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.160\nI didn't mean to blacklist that guy,\n[LAUGH] poor guy.\n\n176\n00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.380\nAnd I need to put him in the whitelist,\n\n177\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.690\nand then if I'm taking him off blacklist\nthen I have to update my control policy.\n\n178\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.380\nBut this is how you add them into\nthe global white and blacklist,\n\n179\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.330\nby coming into our context explore,\nand right-clicking.\n\n180\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.820\nAnd I can do it from multiple\ndifferent screens, but\n\n181\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.900\nyou get it from your vents and\nthat's how you add it.\n\n182\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.980\nAll right, that was kind of\nwhat I was trying to get to.\n\n183\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.390\nSo come back here, where am I?\n\n184\n00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.560\nAnd here we are in security intelligence.\n\n185\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.000\nNow, the first thing I wanna do\n\n186\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.850\nis I'm gonna see some\nCisco Source Fire Authored Objects.\n\n187\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.320\nThis is things security intelligence\nis updated every two hours\n\n188\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.570\n>> These objects are updated,\n\n189\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.250\nI would use these.\n\n190\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.490\nTheir not on by default so\nyou'd have to choose them.\n\n191\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.790\nSo I'm going to come down here and\nnotice there is your exit note,\n\n192\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.230\nisn't it that you mentioned yesterday.\n\n193\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.930\nRight.\n\n194\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.510\nAnd I'm going to add\nthese to my black list.\n\n195\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.765\nOkay. Okay. So now they're in my\nblack list and these are objects and\n\n196\n00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:56.385\nwhen Cisco updates these every two hours,\nI don't have to update my control policy,\n\n197\n00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:58.915\nbut the black list is\nbeing updated constantly.\n\n198\n00:08:58.915 --> 00:09:00.105\nI would do this every time.\n\n199\n00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.190\nYou've got nothing to lose by doing this.\n\n200\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.100\n>> What you pay for,\nyou might as well take advantage of it.\n\n201\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.640\n>> Absolutely.\n\n202\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.800\nThat's part of your subscription that\nyou're paying every year, right?\n\n203\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.440\nAll right.\nNow, down here, though,\n\n204\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.100\nnotice here's my objects that I made\nyesterday for my internal networks.\n\n205\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.840\nHere's my corporate network which\nincludes all of this stuff.\n\n206\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.340\nRight?\nSo\n\n207\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.330\nI'm gonna say this is\nthe corporate network.\n\n208\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.680\nAnd if you guys remember, I put all\nthose other objects in this group.\n\n209\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.295\nSo I'm gonna add this to the whitelist.\n\n210\n00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:24.405\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n211\n00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:28.115\nBecause if someone comes in here and\ndoes this.\n\n212\n00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:29.385\nWatch this.\nSo I've got this,\n\n213\n00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:33.295\nand someone adds it to the black list,\nlook what happens.\n\n214\n00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.685\nCan you see that?\n\n215\n00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:36.435\nProbably not.\n\n216\n00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:36.954\nLet me.\n\n217\n00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:38.223\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:40.635\n>> But nonetheless, it's crossed out.\n\n219\n00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.910\nSo basically, it's saying,\nyeah, I'm not blacklisting you.\n\n220\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.970\nCuz you're in the whitelist.\n\n221\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:51.450\nThe whitelist only exists to override\nthe blacklist in case someone screws up.\n\n222\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.250\nBecause if someone takes your internal\nnetwork and goes like this, and\n\n223\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:00.740\ntakes RC 1918 and adds that to your\nblacklist, now it's in my blacklist,\n\n224\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.410\nit's gonna be overridden here, because\nit's inside this group up here, right.\n\n225\n00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.820\nBut down here, it's here and\n\n226\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.970\nit's automatically taken effect and\nsomeone actually put that in there.\n\n227\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.585\nThe sales server, so someone got into\nthe sales server and they accidentally\n\n228\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.580\nright-clicked and put that from the events\nand put that into my blacklist.\n\n229\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.600\nSo I'm just like my gosh.\n\n230\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.380\nSo I don't want to put that in there so\nwe're going to make sure and\n\n231\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.180\nwhite list this stuff.\n\n232\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.920\nRight.\nAnd\n\n233\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.490\nmake sure that none of this if it ends up\nin the black list that we override that.\n\n234\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.140\nOkay.\n\n235\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.750\nSo first off just choose these guys.\n\n236\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.210\nTake internal networks\nout into your white list.\n\n237\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.230\nThat's the first thing I tell all\nof my students to do when you\n\n238\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.460\nstart your access control policy.\n\n239\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.740\nOkay.\nNow, but wait,\n\n240\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.255\nwhat was the one thing I told you when\nwe started access control policies?\n\n241\n00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.810\nI'm waiting, what do you think?\n\n242\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.830\nWhat do we need to do?\n\n243\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.720\nEvery time we do something in an access\ncontrol policy, what do we have to do?\n\n244\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.410\nEnable logging.\n\n245\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.990\nThis is no different here.\n\n246\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.320\nSo, I'm I'm going to come over here to\nthe right, there's a scroll right here.\n\n247\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.660\nSo if something's hit by the black list,\ndon't you want to now about it?\n\n248\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.200\nSo, maybe you don't want to know about it.\n\n249\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.510\nYou just want it blocked and\nit's going, but I like to see things so\n\n250\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.190\nI'm going to go ahead and\nlog the connections on my blacklist.\n\n251\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.050\nNow, the next one's kind of fun.\n\n252\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.780\nSo we took do a lot of HTTP blocking.\n\n253\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.560\nIn other words, we don't want people to\ngo to certain places.d And whether it's\n\n254\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.160\nFacebook or whatever, we say hey,\nwe don't want you to go off to this place.\n\n255\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.680\nWe know it's malware.\n\n256\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.020\nWe're gonna put that in there.\n\n257\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.920\nWe're gonna block it with HTTP.\n\n258\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.260\nWell if the user goes out there and\n\n259\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.170\nit's got a block with reset,\nwhat are they gonna get?\n\n260\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.730\nThey're gonna get like a 404 error or\nsomething like that.\n\n261\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.425\nNot a very good user experience.\n\n262\n00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:38.653\nAnd the problem with that,\nit makes people wanna call you.\n\n263\n00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:41.456\nAnd so I try to stop people from\ncalling me as much as possible.\n\n264\n00:11:41.456 --> 00:11:46.239\nPossible by letting them know hey,\nwe blocked this on purpose.\n\n265\n00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.464\nIf you want more information\nyou can call me, but\n\n266\n00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:50.430\nyou get an idea of what\nI'm gonna tell you.\n\n267\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.790\nSo the block response page says,\nI can do a block, an HTTP block.\n\n268\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.490\nAnd at this case here,\nI can give them a message.\n\n269\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.490\nI can do source fire provided, or\ncustom, and I can change it here.\n\n270\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.190\nIt says hey, you're attempting\nto access a forbidden in psych,\n\n271\n00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.820\nconsult your administrator for details.\n\n272\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.780\nI like to add things like please\ngather your personal belongings and\n\n273\n00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.688\nmeet security at the front door.\n\n274\n00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:21.764\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That one I like.\n\n275\n00:12:21.764 --> 00:12:22.681\nThat was fun.\n\n276\n00:12:22.681 --> 00:12:23.806\nRight.\nI like screwing with people.\n\n277\n00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:27.014\nSo,you know, when they see something\nlike that, they're like, my God.\n\n278\n00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:29.488\nSo you can have fun like that but,\non a serious note,\n\n279\n00:12:29.488 --> 00:12:31.793\nin a serious enterprise maybe your CEO,\nCFO, or\n\n280\n00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:35.945\nCTO might not think that's too funny, but\nI think it's funny so I'm gonna save that.\n\n281\n00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:39.480\n[LAUGH] All right, so right now if they\ngo out to a site I didn't like, and\n\n282\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.490\nit could've been anything that\n[LAUGH] I choose at this point.\n\n283\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.860\nThey're gonna grab their\npersonal belongings and\n\n284\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.290\nmeet security at the front door.\n\n285\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.130\nAll right.\nSo on a serious note, we can change that.\n\n286\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.620\nNow here's the other thing we can do.\n\n287\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.250\nLet's say, that a lot of people\nspend time on social media.\n\n288\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.280\nWell, I think that's a duh at any company.\n\n289\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.400\nThat everyone's on YouTube and\nFacebook and Twitter all the time.\n\n290\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.130\nSo we can set up your off filter here.\n\n291\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.670\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nhow easy it is to do.\n\n292\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.270\nWe just go like that and boom,\nthey're done, they can't do it.\n\n293\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.690\nSo they go out there, and what you\nwanna do is they say hey, I work for\n\n294\n00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.990\nthe union and I demand my break and\nI demand social media, or whatever.\n\n295\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.580\nI'm giving you an extreme example.\n\n296\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.270\nBut we can sit there and\nsay okay, all right, all right,\n\n297\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.760\nit's not company policy,\nbut a break's demanded.\n\n298\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.590\nYou get your break, so what I could do\nis say, I'm gonna let you go out there,\n\n299\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.680\nbut after ten minutes,\nI'm gonna block, reset the connection.\n\n300\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.700\nAll right, I can change that to 15, but\nsay that you have 15 minute breaks.\n\n301\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.430\nSo, in other words,\nI can allow them to go.\n\n302\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.740\nBasically, what this says is\nyou're gonna go out there to,\n\n303\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.610\nit's not meeting our security policy, but\n\n304\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.160\nwe're gonna allow you to go out there, you\nclick here but we're watching you, right?\n\n305\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.490\nAnd by the default, it's ten minutes,\nbut we can change that and\n\n306\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.220\nsay, after this certain amount of\nperiod of time, it's gonna be reset.\n\n307\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.890\nThat means it's time to go back to work,\nright?\n\n308\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.740\nThis is an example of what you can do.\n\n309\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.770\nOr in this case here,\nwe can just sit there and say,\n\n310\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.780\nyou're accessing a forbidden site.\n\n311\n00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.170\nClick, press here to go, and\njust don't even tell them\n\n312\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.800\nit's just reset after ten minutes,\ndepending on what you want to do.\n\n313\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.420\n>> So now, yeah, I've seen policies where\nthey've basically said all right, well,\n\n314\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.910\nfrom\n>> From noon to one,\n\n315\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.620\nyou can browse the internet, right?\n\n316\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.310\nSet to a time.\nBut you mentioned breaks,\n\n317\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.110\nand people take breaks at different times,\nso this would actually work out really\n\n318\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.700\nwell for that because it's just-\n>> Because now they can go to Twitter or\n\n319\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.800\nFacebook, and that's just reset, and\n\n320\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.660\nthen every time that that's\nreset we get an alert.\n\n321\n00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.120\nSo if they did it 100 times a day,\nwe would know they were basically\n\n322\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.970\nat Facebook or\nTwitter all day long, still, right?\n\n323\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.640\n>> But\nif they stayed within their ten minutes\n\n324\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640\n>> It would be okay?\n\n325\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.930\n>> And the laughed, and\nwe wouldn't even know, and it's fine.\n\n326\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.420\n>> Excellent.\n\n327\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.580\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nAnd so, these are your options,\n\n328\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.960\nand the reason I'm showing you this,\n\n329\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.410\nis because if you don't do something\nlike this, and we are gonna block HTTP,\n\n330\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.520\nand HTTP is gonna come up blocked\n>> You are gonna get a phone call right,\n\n331\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.420\nand their gonna say.\n\n332\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.890\nhey I can't get to the site, or\nyou usually get the blank one,\n\n333\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.310\nthe internet is down right?\n\n334\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.010\nThat's the typical call you get.\n\n335\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.705\nThe internet is down I\ncan't get to the site.\n\n336\n00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:54.725\nI'm, like, the internet's down,\nokay great so we can all\n\n337\n00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:55.237\n>> The whole internet.\n\n338\n00:14:55.237 --> 00:14:56.559\n>> Yeah, the whole internet.\n\n339\n00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.209\nAwesome, let's just take\nthe rest of the day off.\n\n340\n00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:00.715\n>> I'll go reboot the Internet,\nI'll be right back.\n\n341\n00:15:00.715 --> 00:15:03.788\nNow what we're doing here is\nsort of like a URL filter, and\n\n342\n00:15:03.788 --> 00:15:06.820\nI know that's one of the licensed\nfeatures that we have.\n\n343\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.090\nBut this is technically\nnot a prescription.\n\n344\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.630\n>> This is a response to a URL filter.\n\n345\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.420\n>> Okay.\n>> So, we haven't done the URL filter yet.\n\n346\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.230\nWhen I do the URL filter and\nI block something.\n\n347\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.075\nThis, what I'm setting up now is\nthe response they're gonna get, so\n\n348\n00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:17.759\ndon't call me.\n\n349\n00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.943\nOr that I'm gonna allow them to.\n\n350\n00:15:18.943 --> 00:15:19.988\nSo, we haven't done any.\n\n351\n00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:22.280\nAgain, we haven't done anything yet.\n\n352\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.190\nAgain, now we're setting up what\nhappens when they try to do that and\n\n353\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.410\nI set the URL filter for\nFacebook or whatever, right?\n\n354\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.150\nAnd they go out there.\n\n355\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.590\nWhat's the response they get?\n\n356\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.500\nSo, I'm trying to say,\nI don't want you to call me.\n\n357\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.600\nSo, I'm gonna put this\nmessage out there for you.\n\n358\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.620\nThat's where we're at.\n\n359\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.390\nNow, let's go through this.\n\n360\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.286\nThis next screen when it says\nadvanced that's what they mean.\n\n361\n00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:39.285\nThis one's kind of advanced.\n\n362\n00:15:39.285 --> 00:15:40.390\nBut it's important that we go through is.\n\n363\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.061\nNow you don't have change anything here.\n\n364\n00:15:42.061 --> 00:15:43.316\nI would probably make a couple changes.\n\n365\n00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:45.684\nLet's take a look.\n\n366\n00:15:45.684 --> 00:15:53.346\nFirst off we have some general settings.\n\n367\n00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:56.340\nSo maximum URL characters is total,\nwe'll leave that.\n\n368\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.600\nNow, the interactive block.\n\n369\n00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.527\nRemember that ten minute\nsetting I just showed you?\n\n370\n00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:01.461\nNotice that's set for\n10 minutes 60 seconds.\n\n371\n00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.644\nSo I can change that to\nhowever long I want.\n\n372\n00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:06.314\nSay, okay they want to do it on a lunch\nhour, maybe I give them an hour.\n\n373\n00:16:06.314 --> 00:16:08.798\nWhatever it is.\n\n374\n00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:11.698\nNow SSL policy for\ninspecting encrypted connections,\n\n375\n00:16:11.698 --> 00:16:16.089\nat this point with the ASA's I can't even\ndo this, so I'm not going to change this.\n\n376\n00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:17.518\nBut with the appliances I can, and\n\n377\n00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.940\nit is something you might want\nto think about at that time.\n\n378\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.490\nNow here's the next one that's\nkinda important to you.\n\n379\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.850\nDo I inspect traffic during policy apply?\n\n380\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.020\nNow this is a hard one.\n\n381\n00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.753\nQuestion my friend.\n\n382\n00:16:28.753 --> 00:16:33.535\nIt sounds easy but it's really relatively\nrough on you because what you're\n\n383\n00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:37.119\nsaying is hey,\nI gotta apply my access control policy and\n\n384\n00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:40.349\nI don't want anything to\ngo through uninspected.\n\n385\n00:16:40.349 --> 00:16:43.341\nNow how long does it take to\ndo your access control policy?\n\n386\n00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:46.471\nYou know, depending on the box,\nif you have an appliance,\n\n387\n00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:50.820\nnot really that concerned, you're\nnot even dropping that much traffic.\n\n388\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.870\nYou know, in this case here\nwhat it's saying is look,\n\n389\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.080\nI can't go through and inspect it.\n\n390\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.145\nSo, I'm gonna drop traffic while I'm\nupdating my access control policy.\n\n391\n00:16:57.145 --> 00:17:01.756\nIf I have this 5506, they could be 10\nminutes, you know, or something like that,\n\n392\n00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:03.301\nthat I'm dropping traffic.\n\n393\n00:17:03.301 --> 00:17:05.322\nSo, it depends on your device.\n\n394\n00:17:05.322 --> 00:17:09.024\nBut the answer is anywhere from\na few seconds to a few minutes, but\n\n395\n00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:13.268\nnonetheless, you're dropping traffic\nbecause what you're saying is,\n\n396\n00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:16.523\nI can't let any traffic come\nthrough here uninspected.\n\n397\n00:17:16.523 --> 00:17:18.827\nNow that might,\nmaybe you don't work at a hospital, but\n\n398\n00:17:18.827 --> 00:17:22.235\nyou don't have to worry about HIPPA, maybe\nthat's not that important to you and you\n\n399\n00:17:22.235 --> 00:17:25.704\nwant connectivity over security, well I'm\ngonna come in here and change this then.\n\n400\n00:17:25.704 --> 00:17:28.407\nI'll just click this pencil icon and\nchange that and says nah,\n\n401\n00:17:28.407 --> 00:17:31.945\nwhile I'm doing my access control policy\nlet things go through uninspected.\n\n402\n00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:33.635\nAnd I'm sure everything will be fine.\n\n403\n00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:35.746\nYou know, everyone in this\nworld is actually good people.\n\n404\n00:17:35.746 --> 00:17:38.413\nI really don't think anyone's truly\ntrying to attack me, right, and\n\n405\n00:17:38.413 --> 00:17:39.577\nall that other stuff, right?\n\n406\n00:17:39.577 --> 00:17:40.111\nGood luck with that one.\n\n407\n00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:41.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n408\n00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:44.329\nThat's a decision you guys have to make,\nright?\n\n409\n00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.591\nThat's the hard one, right?\n\n410\n00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.850\nYou have to decide,\ndo I let it go through uninspected?\n\n411\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.070\nOr do I make it wait?\n\n412\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.060\nAll right, that's a decision by\ndefault it's saying, don't, right?\n\n413\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.500\nIt's saying no, no,\n\n414\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.900\nno, it has to be inspected so\nI'm not gonna let it go through, right?\n\n415\n00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.230\nThat's your default.\n\n416\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.170\nJust remember that.\n\n417\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.110\nAll right,\nlet's come down here to the next one.\n\n418\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.130\nThis has to do with my file policy.\n\n419\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.506\nI mention this.\n\n420\n00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:08.879\nWhile we're determining\nwhat type of file it is,\n\n421\n00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.369\nwe have to look at the first 1480 bytes,\nright.\n\n422\n00:18:11.369 --> 00:18:13.993\nAnd that takes some time, you know.\n\n423\n00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.778\nNot time like we think about time,\n\n424\n00:18:15.778 --> 00:18:19.590\nlike hey we're going to lunch we're\ngoing to take this kind of time.\n\n425\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.060\nWe're talking about milliseconds and\nso on.\n\n426\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.970\nBut you know we can get a lot of\nthreats through in that period of time.\n\n427\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:29.230\nSo what we're saying is intrusion\npolicy used before access control rule\n\n428\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.310\nis determined.\n\n429\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.660\nSo basically, it could be a file\npolicy where we determine that,\n\n430\n00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.250\nor which rule do we hit on,\nwhich rule was this triggered on.\n\n431\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.710\nDoes it get all the way to the end?\n\n432\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.334\nWhat we're determining in the access\ncontrol policy where this is applied,\n\n433\n00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:46.243\nthis file is applied,\nwe're saying well we have an IPS role.\n\n434\n00:18:46.243 --> 00:18:50.050\nNow this is new with 54 and in 60.\n\n435\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:55.373\nAnd it's basically saying, because\nthe very first thing, you guys understand.\n\n436\n00:18:55.373 --> 00:18:56.953\nLet me backtrack for one second.\n\n437\n00:18:56.953 --> 00:19:01.573\nWhen a file comes in okay before this\nwas here the first thing that hit was\n\n438\n00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.272\nsecurity intelligence.\n\n439\n00:19:03.272 --> 00:19:08.433\nAnd if it was white listed boom then\nit went to the access control policy.\n\n440\n00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:11.057\nIf it didn't meet in the black list,\nit went to the access control policy.\n\n441\n00:19:11.057 --> 00:19:15.520\nIf it hit the black list boom, it was\nsent to the null bucket, period right?\n\n442\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.580\nSo the first thing we hit\nwas security intelligence.\n\n443\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.080\nOnce we hit security intelligence, then\nwe went to our access control policy and\n\n444\n00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.730\nwe went down line by line by\nline until we got to the end and\n\n445\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.950\nhit our base policy right\ndown at the bottom.\n\n446\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.359\nThat's the way that it worked.\n\n447\n00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:32.007\nBut they said, well wait a minute, while\nwe're going down line by line determining\n\n448\n00:19:32.007 --> 00:19:36.530\nhow we're supposed to handle this file,\nmaybe we can be looking at an IPS policy.\n\n449\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.855\nAnd that's what this is, right.\n\n450\n00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:41.340\nAnd we can determine the file type and\nso on.\n\n451\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.471\nAnd all this is, while we're doing this,\nwe're determining that,\n\n452\n00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:48.030\nwe're running this sort rule.\n\n453\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.870\nNow be careful here, guys.\n\n454\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:54.127\nHaving all these on and putting this on\nyou might be adding a lot of overhead.\n\n455\n00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:56.730\nThat happens even before you\nhit your access control policy.\n\n456\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.750\nSo you need to kind of think about this.\n\n457\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.195\nNow the network analysis\npolicy we'll come back to but\n\n458\n00:20:01.195 --> 00:20:04.451\nthese are the pre processors that\nI've mentioned for the last two days.\n\n459\n00:20:04.451 --> 00:20:06.169\nSo it's a configuration\nof the pre processors.\n\n460\n00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:07.887\nWe'll definitely gonna do that.\n\n461\n00:20:07.887 --> 00:20:10.350\nWe're gonna go through and do it but\nI need you to be careful with this.\n\n462\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.385\nSo I'm gonna show you this, but we're not\ngonna tell anybody else because if they go\n\n463\n00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:16.079\nout there and they screw these up then\nit makes your network inefficient and\n\n464\n00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:18.710\nyou might miss threads and\nwe're reading the data wrong.\n\n465\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.740\nAnd so we don't really want\nto screw with preprocessors.\n\n466\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.463\nSo this is just gonna be between me and\nyou and\n\n467\n00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:25.477\nyou're not gonna share this with anyone,\nright?\n\n468\n00:20:25.477 --> 00:20:29.192\nKeep this right here between all of us,\nright here, we're all friends.\n\n469\n00:20:29.192 --> 00:20:32.426\nSo now we got our basic file\nof malware settings and\n\n470\n00:20:32.426 --> 00:20:35.817\nthese didn't really change\nfrom the last version.\n\n471\n00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:37.582\nBut this was all new here, right.\n\n472\n00:20:37.582 --> 00:20:40.568\nAll right now, so limit the number bytes\nespecially when doing files types and\n\n473\n00:20:40.568 --> 00:20:42.625\nit's 14, I've been 1480, it's 1460.\n\n474\n00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:48.195\nNow, remember I mentioned yesterday,\nwhen we were doing a file type detection.\n\n475\n00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:52.138\nHow much time do we have to send it\nto analysis, get a file disposition,\n\n476\n00:20:52.138 --> 00:20:56.195\nsend it to the center, which would\nthen send it to the managed device.\n\n477\n00:20:56.195 --> 00:20:57.843\nHow much time do we have\nto do this big loop?\n\n478\n00:20:57.843 --> 00:20:59.748\nTwo seconds, and that's set right here.\n\n479\n00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:01.396\nDo you really wanna do that for\nmore than two seconds.\n\n480\n00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:04.252\nNot really at this point here, but\nif it's more than two seconds,\n\n481\n00:21:04.252 --> 00:21:05.530\nwe just let the file go right?\n\n482\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.323\nAnd so,\nthat's something you need to consider.\n\n483\n00:21:08.323 --> 00:21:11.583\nDo not calculate SHA values for\nanything larger than 10 megs.\n\n484\n00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:15.143\nSo, now, we're sitting there saying,\nwell, we're not gonna look for malware for\n\n485\n00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:15.990\nsomething larger.\n\n486\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.300\nWe're not gonna send it to the network or\nsomething larger than ten megs.\n\n487\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.360\nWhy?\nWell I was looking at some malware today\n\n488\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.220\nthat was like 2K.\n\n489\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.480\nYeah, I mean maybe it was 3K.\n\n490\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.770\nIt was really small.\n\n491\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.236\nI was using that to do some attacks.\n\n492\n00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:27.653\nI was like,\nlet me use this little malware.\n\n493\n00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:30.299\nI'm like, man this is the smallest\nthing I've ever seen.\n\n494\n00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:34.247\nIt's like, so I mean these things fit in\napps, I mean they're really, really small.\n\n495\n00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:37.381\nWe can get ransomware in a very\nsmall package, my friends.\n\n496\n00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:38.186\nAll right, now so\n\n497\n00:21:38.186 --> 00:21:41.320\nbasically they're sitting there\nsaying there's two things here.\n\n498\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.420\nOne, we don't see malware\nin large files like that.\n\n499\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.470\nAnd two, it's gonna take a long time for\nme to calculate something like that too.\n\n500\n00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.047\nAll right, minimum file to store in bytes,\nmaximum file to store in bytes.\n\n501\n00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:53.346\nRemember we're transferring packets.\n\n502\n00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.970\nI want to store these files so\nI can do analysis, dynamic analysis.\n\n503\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.200\nYou know send it up to the cloud for\nanalysis later.\n\n504\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.060\nOr the reason I would store it is\nto send it up to my own sand box.\n\n505\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.580\nHey like I trust mine more than theirs.\n\n506\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.250\nI don't think that you should say that\nbecause these guys are pretty smart,\n\n507\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.090\nbut you might wanna just\nhave your own sandbox.\n\n508\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.370\nMinimum file size for dynamic analysis and\nmaximum for dynamic analysis right?\n\n509\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.810\nSo we're not gonna send more than 20 megs.\n\n510\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.807\nAll right, some of this other stuff over\nhere I'm not gonna go through right now.\n\n511\n00:22:17.807 --> 00:22:20.185\nWe're gonna go through this\nwhen we hit the pre-process and\n\n512\n00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:22.246\nwe're talking about\nthe network analysis policy.\n\n513\n00:22:22.246 --> 00:22:24.753\nAll right,\nin this case here you can see this.\n\n514\n00:22:24.753 --> 00:22:26.358\nThere's pre-processors here,\n\n515\n00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:29.296\nadaptive profiles are something\nyou'll probably wanna set.\n\n516\n00:22:29.296 --> 00:22:31.930\nAnd these performance settings,\nwe'll go through as well.\n\n517\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.696\nOkay, so now that we've through this you\nmay wanna screw with the general settings\n\n518\n00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:39.967\nunder inspect traffic during apply and\nnetwork analysis\n\n519\n00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:44.802\nintrusion policies while we're looking at\nour file in determining the file type and\n\n520\n00:22:44.802 --> 00:22:47.074\ngoing through access control policy.\n\n521\n00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:50.185\nWhat happens before we hit\nsecurity intelligence?\n\n522\n00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:51.696\nThat's what this is saying.\n\n523\n00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:55.204\nAnd so you can determine that,\nyou may leave these alone.\n\n524\n00:22:55.204 --> 00:22:58.430\nI might just turn them off so\nI can come in here and say, you know what?\n\n525\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.630\nMan, I've got so\nmuch data I'm trying to get through,\n\n526\n00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.180\nthis thing's just slowing me down.\n\n527\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.990\nSo I'm going to come down here and\nsay intrusion policy, and\n\n528\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.400\nI'm going to say no rules active.\n\n529\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.400\nIn other words I'm just saying go\nstraight to security intelligence.\n\n530\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.870\nThis might not be a bad thing my friends,\nit depends on your network.\n\n531\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.731\n>> And if you do that, if you're just\ngoing through security intelligence, well,\n\n532\n00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:17.601\nyou're downloading that information for.\n\n533\n00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:21.338\nSo it's kinda like following their best\npractice, but if you have exceptions.\n\n534\n00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:22.384\n>> Yeah.\n\n535\n00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:23.893\n>> It kind takes that power away from you,\nright?\n\n536\n00:23:23.893 --> 00:23:26.220\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the one thing, when I saw this,\n\n537\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.193\nI was like, okay,\nthis seems like a little overkill.\n\n538\n00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:33.173\nIt's a lot of work, that's what my access\ncontrol policy is for, I'm supposed to go\n\n539\n00:23:33.173 --> 00:23:37.127\nthrough here, but remember, I can't say\nenough about how smart these people are.\n\n540\n00:23:37.127 --> 00:23:39.101\nThere is a reason that they did this,\nright?\n\n541\n00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.238\nWe're spending a lot of time going through\nthe access control policy and the key was,\n\n542\n00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:44.790\nremember I told you yesterday,\n\n543\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.850\nas we're determining the file type if we\nhave a file policy, what are we doing?\n\n544\n00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.140\nWe're transferring that file.\n\n545\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.890\nAnd if we don't get an answer\nby the time we get to the end,\n\n546\n00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.290\nwe're gonna send that file.\n\n547\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.976\nSo we're going to,\nthis is why they set this up.\n\n548\n00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:59.443\nWhile determining the file type for\nexample, let's go through the sort rules\n\n549\n00:23:59.443 --> 00:24:02.504\nand that's what this is saying and\nthat's why they did this, okay?\n\n550\n00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:04.642\nSo again, you might not need that,\n\n551\n00:24:04.642 --> 00:24:07.650\nyou might not wanna change\nthe network analysis.\n\n552\n00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.960\nYou'll determine that when we get\nto the preprocessor settings.\n\n553\n00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.730\nAll right, so this looks pretty good,\nbut we really haven't done a lot yet.\n\n554\n00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.370\nI keep saying that, we've been saying\nthat for two days now but, woo,\n\n555\n00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.585\nwe're getting to that point where we're\nactually gonna do something right now.\n\n556\n00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:20.621\nSo I'm gonna come back here and\ncreate some rules.\n\n557\n00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:24.871\nNow I can leave this alone and just do\nsecurity intelligence, log my thing, but\n\n558\n00:24:24.871 --> 00:24:28.805\nI'm going through security intelligence\nand if it's not blacklisted,\n\n559\n00:24:28.805 --> 00:24:32.563\nwhich means it's gonna be dropped,\nI'm just gonna drop it anyways.\n\n560\n00:24:32.563 --> 00:24:35.255\nThat's what this rule says so far.\n\n561\n00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:35.975\nI might be good with that.\n\n",

00:00:17.231\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:22.711\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Cisco Firepower.\n\n5\n00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.408\nAnd in this episode, we're going to\nbe doing the exciting conclusion to\n\n6\n00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.601\nthe cliffhanger finale we had in part one.\n\n7\n00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.075\nWhere we got a chance to see\nour Access Control policy and\n\n8\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.301\nsome of the rules that we\ncould put in place there.\n\n9\n00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.370\nNow we're gonna look at some\nof the advanced features.\n\n10\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.208\nThere's a ton of stuff that Todd wanted\nto get to in the last episode that we're\n\n11\n00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.160\ngonna take a look at here.\n\n12\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.708\nBecause when you start customizing these\npolicies for your own environment,\n\n13\n00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:47.091\nyou're gonna need a lot of these features\nto get things set just the way your\n\n14\n00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:47.965\ncompany needs it.\n\n15\n00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:52.210\nSo without further ado, I'm gonna turn\nit over to the big man, Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n16\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.670\nTodd, where do we go from here?\n\n17\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.400\n>> I'm gonna show you some complex Access\nControl policies, if we have time, [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.740\nto go through and take a look at what\nsome experts have done, other experts.\n\n19\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.870\nAll right, so let's add another rule here.\n\n20\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.220\nAnd this one's gonna be\nMonitor All Traffic.\n\n21\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.826\nAnd so I'm gonna allow rule,\nI'm just gonna say it's a Monitor rule.\n\n22\n00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:18.639\nBasically I'm gonna say, hey when\nsomething comes in, alert me, log it and\n\n23\n00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.235\nnotice right away,\nlogging is enabled by default.\n\n24\n00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:25.350\nCuz all I'm saying if anything comes\nin here, if it hits this line.\n\n25\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.330\nLog can send it and it connects you\nin advance, and I'm gonna see it.\n\n26\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.520\nAll right, and\nnotice logging is enabled by default.\n\n27\n00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.780\nAnd that's the only thing,\nI'm not choosing anything else,\n\n28\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.900\nlogging into connections.\n\n29\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.460\nNow, I also want to say something like,\nI want to trust some traffic.\n\n30\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.520\nThat doesn't mean it's not gonna\nbe blocked later down when\n\n31\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.470\nit gets to the bottom,\ncuz it certainly will.\n\n32\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.040\nThe trust means you're not\ngonna go to the next rule.\n\n33\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.430\nI'm gonna come back here to Add Rule.\n\n34\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.460\nAnd I'm gonna say, Trust UDP DNS.\n\n35\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.920\nAnd this one I do a lot because really,\nI don't want to see this.\n\n36\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.160\nWhat is the biggest traffic that\nI see in a lot of my networks?\n\n37\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.797\nUsers are using DNS over UDP right?\n\n38\n00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:06.854\nCuz that's our queries.\n\n39\n00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:09.133\nWe see that all the time I'm like,\nthose are fine,\n\n40\n00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.790\nI'm not really worried about them.\n\n41\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.225\nHonestly, I don't even want to see\nthe connection because I'm getting enough\n\n42\n00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:14.950\nevents as it is.\n\n43\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.579\nSo, this one I use.\n\n44\n00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.485\nAnd so I'm gonna trust this,\nthat means as soon as I see this traffic,\n\n45\n00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:21.558\nboom go to [INAUDIBLE], you're fine,\nyou're not gonna hit the last one.\n\n46\n00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.930\nAll right, so we're gonna trust that.\n\n47\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.220\nSo now I have to set this up.\n\n48\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.718\nAnd so I'm gonna say leave the networks,\nI don't even really care, and\n\n49\n00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.910\nI'm gonna come to the applications,\nI'm sorry.\n\n50\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.460\nWe wanna go to ports in this case here.\n\n51\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.310\nAnd I wanna say, if it's DNS over UDP,\nAdd to Destination.\n\n52\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.890\nAnd we're gonna go ahead log it.\n\n53\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.690\nSo, we're gonna trust DNS over UDP,\nvery simple rule.\n\n54\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.170\n[COUGH] And, now at this point,\nI can log it or not log it.\n\n55\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.610\nMaybe I don't want this logged,\nI just want this to trust some traffic.\n\n56\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.530\nSo I'm probably not gonna log this.\n\n57\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.750\nRemember I have that monitor all.\n\n58\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.440\nSo if we look at our rules right here,\n\n59\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.738\nwe can see that we're\nblocking [INAUDIBLE] cells.\n\n60\n00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:05.890\nWe're logging it, we're monitoring all\nother traffic and this one's not seen it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.350\nBut wait,\nthis kinda doesn't make any sense.\n\n62\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.140\nI don't want this log,\ndon't even want to see the traffic.\n\n63\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.510\nBut the line above it says monitor.\n\n64\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.311\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna take this rule, and\n\n65\n00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.130\nI'll move this up here to the top.\n\n66\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.090\nAnd now, when that comes through,\nI'm gonna trust and send to the egress.\n\n67\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.610\nAnd it's not even gonna go\ndown to the next line, right?\n\n68\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.631\nThen the other thing is, is if it's\nblocked here, then I won't monitor it.\n\n69\n00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:30.673\nI won't see it, I won't get a connection,\nI will see the lock, and that's fine.\n\n70\n00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:32.400\nAnd maybe we just want\nto leave it like this.\n\n71\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.518\nBut I'm gonna move the monitor right here.\n\n72\n00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:36.458\nSo I'm gonna trust this data,\nnot log it in any way.\n\n73\n00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.889\nAnd then I'm gonna log everything\nelse that comes in, and\n\n74\n00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.860\nI'm not gonna do anything to it.\n\n75\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.780\nBut just log it at this point, all right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.433\nSo now let's go ahead and do another for\nfun, cuz this is fun, right?\n\n77\n00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:49.933\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:51.438\n>> This is where people start,\n\n79\n00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:53.257\nthey see you creating the rules and\n\n80\n00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:56.079\nin our minds, we're thinking, okay.\nWhat rules\n\n81\n00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.762\nwould I be making for my environment?\nWhat's\n\n82\n00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:01.350\nthe kind of stuff that we'd put in place?\nSo here's where we really start\n\n83\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.570\ncustomizing it, and thinking of\nall the power that's out there.\n\n84\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.337\nIt's really the best part.\n\n85\n00:04:05.337 --> 00:04:06.290\n>> It is the best part.\n\n86\n00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.612\nAnd now we're gonna get to\nthe meat of the subject,\n\n87\n00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:13.760\nbecause remember we created that\nfile policy and IPS policy?\n\n88\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.684\nAnd how do we put those into\nour Access Control policy?\n\n89\n00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:18.957\nI take an allow rule,\ncan't do it with any other rule.\n\n90\n00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:23.424\nI create an allow rule, and\nI'm just gonna name it Attach IPS and\n\n91\n00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:25.260\nFile Policy, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.800\nNow I can create a rule for each one, it\ndoesn't make any difference in this case.\n\n93\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.760\nI kinda put them together, it's kinda fun.\n\n94\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.500\nSo I'm gonna say allow, and\nI'm not gonna do anything here.\n\n95\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.570\nI'm not gonna change anything.\n\n96\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.580\nI am gonna come back to this\ngeo-location issue though.\n\n97\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.470\nOkay, Inspection, so\nI'm gonna come to Inspection.\n\n98\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.450\nI'm gonna say if my intrusion policy for\nthis role is, there it is right there.\n\n99\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.470\nThere's the IPS policy we created.\n\n100\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.910\nAnd my file policy for this rule,\nthere it is right there.\n\n101\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.425\nSo, now, I'm attaching this\nnotice it's an allow rule.\n\n102\n00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:02.290\nBut you've seen the allow rule, that\ndoesn't mean the traffic's allowed, right?\n\n103\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.971\nIt has to go through my file policy and\nhas to go through my IPS policy,\n\n104\n00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.230\nchances are it's not going to.\n\n105\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.520\nSo if that's the case,\nI need to make sure that we log, right?\n\n106\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.473\nBecause if this happens and gets dropped\nby my IPS policy or my file policy,\n\n107\n00:05:14.473 --> 00:05:18.260\nI'm not gonna know it if I don't log it,\nand that would be ridiculous.\n\n108\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.302\nSo do I log at the beginning,\nlog at the end?\n\n109\n00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:22.450\nIt depends how many\nconnection events you get.\n\n110\n00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.337\nSo let me just tell you so\nI've called Cisco at times said,\n\n111\n00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:26.310\nhey I am having this problem,\nthis problem, this problem.\n\n112\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.438\nThey're like, okay let's change all your\nrules to log at the beginning of the end,\n\n113\n00:05:29.438 --> 00:05:30.860\nso we can really see what's going on.\n\n114\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.580\nSo really the question comes down to,\nare you having some problems?\n\n115\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.310\nDo you really need to see what's going on\nor you just want to hear about it when\n\n116\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.250\nit's been dropped,\nmaybe we just log at the beginning.\n\n117\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.670\nIn this case here,\nI wanna log at the beginning and\n\n118\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.790\nthe end because I like to get\nevents in this environment, right?\n\n119\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.092\n>> I guess if we wanted to\ncustomize that separately for\n\n120\n00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:50.598\nthe intrusion prevention versus the file\npolicy, then that would be an example\n\n121\n00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:53.345\nwhere we might split those into\ntwo rules instead of one rule?\n\n122\n00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:59.647\n>> You could split them into separate\nrules just for administratively, I guess.\n\n123\n00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:00.956\n>> Okay.\n\n124\n00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:04.279\n>> Also, depending on maybe where\nyou want them in your list,\n\n125\n00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.080\nif you think about it like that.\n\n126\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.210\nSo maybe I want one at the top,\nand if it gets all the way down.\n\n127\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.360\nThen it hits this IPS\npolicy type of thing.\n\n128\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.695\nSo when you think about it-\n>> Then you'd wanna [CROSSTALK].\n\n129\n00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:14.066\n>> So many scenarios, right?\n\n130\n00:06:14.066 --> 00:06:18.607\nIt's kinda like when you create\nAccess Control lists on a router or a ASA.\n\n131\n00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:21.601\nMan you really have to think about it,\nand this is no different.\n\n132\n00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:23.080\nHow are we gonna see traffic?\n\n133\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.430\nHow does it go through?\n\n134\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.500\nIt gets a little convoluted here.\n\n135\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.150\nLet's do one more thing,\nand then we'll apply this.\n\n136\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.715\nAnd while we're applying, I'm gonna look\nat some advanced Access Control policies.\n\n137\n00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:38.219\nWhere we're using administrator rules,\nstandard rules and again, the reason you\n\n138\n00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.521\nwould do that is just administratively to\nbreak things up to make them easier for\n\n139\n00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.080\nyou to read.\n\n140\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.014\nAll right, and\nI can create new categories as well.\n\n141\n00:06:44.014 --> 00:06:48.142\nSo we have another rule and I can sit\nhere and say, hey I'm gonna put this,\n\n142\n00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:51.020\nthis new rule is going to be,\nI'll block Germany.\n\n143\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.275\nNow, I don't have anything\nagainst Germany, but\n\n144\n00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:55.590\nyou're gonna see this in\nmy Access Control policy.\n\n145\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.210\nAnd the reason why is,\nI found some malware out there.\n\n146\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.330\nAnd it's fun to go out there and\nsee it get blocked.\n\n147\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.160\nSo we go to Germany, we get that blocked,\nand it shows up in our connection events,\n\n148\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.380\nit's awesome.\n\n149\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.220\nSo at this point here,\nI can say where do I put this rule?\n\n150\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.221\nI want to put it into Category, Standard\nRules, Administrative Rules, Root Rules.\n\n151\n00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.885\nIn this case, it's not important to us.\n\n152\n00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:16.463\nWe don't have a big Access Control policy.\n\n153\n00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:18.200\nI'm just gonna put\neverything in the Standard.\n\n154\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.010\nI can say, where do I put this?\n\n155\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.020\nBelow, above, below rule four, below rule.\n\n156\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.150\nI'll just put it,\nI'll just say below rule [INAUDIBLE].\n\n157\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.360\nNow, remember I can just drag and drop it\nas well, and that's typically what I do.\n\n158\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.589\nBut if you have a really\nlong Access Control policy,\n\n159\n00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.220\nwhich I'm gonna show you in a second.\n\n160\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.352\nThen you might want to consider\ndoing this and keeping this in mind.\n\n161\n00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:40.848\nNow in this case here,\nlet's go over here to Networks and\n\n162\n00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:42.150\nI'm seeing a Block Germany.\n\n163\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.915\nSo I'm gonna just block with reset,\nand I'm gonna do a network here, and\n\n164\n00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:47.820\nI'm gonna click on Geo-location.\n\n165\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.354\nAnd I want to find Germany, and I can look\nthrough here, and I'm sure in Europe and\n\n166\n00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:53.090\nsomewhere.\n\n167\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.712\nBut notice this, I'm gonna type in\nGermany and there it is right there.\n\n168\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:08:01.065\nAnd it's actually the DEU right, so\nwe're gonna see that if my source.\n\n169\n00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:03.411\nIs DEU is really what it is.\n\n170\n00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.850\nGermany.\n\n171\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.290\nHere I have Deutschland right.\n\n172\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.942\nThe homeland or whatever.\n\n173\n00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:11.080\nAnyways and\nthen we're going to block with reset.\n\n174\n00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.386\nAnd once the other so\nI'm making it pretty simple.\n\n175\n00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.058\nNow I'm not suggesting you go out and\nblock Germany.\n\n176\n00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:19.140\nI'm being very broad here because I know\nthere's some place out there with malware.\n\n177\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.390\nI might be a little bit more succinct\nif there was a place coming from\n\n178\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.400\nGermany in my real\nnetwork that had malware.\n\n179\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.229\nIn this case here, I'm like,\nhey, it was coming from Germany.\n\n180\n00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:29.888\nI'm just going to Germany in a whole to\nbe able to create some vents for fun.\n\n181\n00:08:29.888 --> 00:08:33.672\nAll right, and we can only log in\nthe beginning because there is no end.\n\n182\n00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:35.878\nAnd so, pretty simple guys, right?\n\n183\n00:08:35.878 --> 00:08:39.012\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at our rule.\n\n184\n00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:42.681\nNow, sometimes you get\nthese triangles over here.\n\n185\n00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:46.525\nSays, hey, this rule's being preempted\nby rule three or something like that.\n\n186\n00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.057\nAnd basically it's overlapping.\n\n187\n00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:52.546\nOr it says, some of the ones that you see\nare kinda interesting because they'll\n\n188\n00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:56.099\nsit there and say, well,\nthis rule may or may not take effect.\n\n189\n00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:59.163\nDepends on what happens with\nthe IPS policy above it.\n\n190\n00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:02.461\nSo it says,\nuntil that IPS policy is determined.\n\n191\n00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.363\nThis rule will not make a decision\non what to do with the file.\n\n192\n00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:06.410\n>> Hm.\n\n193\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.240\n>> Okay, so\nyou might see things like that.\n\n194\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.130\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n195\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.210\nAnd I'm gonna say, save and apply.\n\n196\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.260\nRemember, I put my targets in there.\n\n197\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.277\nSo this is gonna take us a couple minutes.\n\n198\n00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:14.525\nSo while we're looking at this,\n\n199\n00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:16.807\nI'm gonna let this go, and\nwe'll open up the task manager.\n\n200\n00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:17.435\nAnd we're gonna watch it.\n\n201\n00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:20.396\nI'm gonna say, okay,\ngo ahead and apply it all.\n\n202\n00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:24.078\nAnd we're going to let that go,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n203\n00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:29.778\ntake a look at some Cisco authored access\ncontrol policies that are pretty amazing.\n\n204\n00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:33.005\nOkay, so these are some good\nexamples where am I looking here?\n\n205\n00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:36.837\nThat's me, there they go right here,\nlet's take a look at this one here.\n\n206\n00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.065\nThis is one I keep kinda on hand,\nand go wow!\n\n207\n00:09:40.065 --> 00:09:44.307\nYou know, these guys really thought about\nthis, and this gives you an example of how\n\n208\n00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:48.450\ndetailed you can be, and how succinct you\ncan be, and how hard this can be as well.\n\n209\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.947\nAnd this one here,\nthey didn't do any administrator rules,\n\n210\n00:09:51.947 --> 00:09:53.908\nso I didn't pick my best one here.\n\n211\n00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:58.559\nBut I want you to notice right here,\nif it's coming from Zone A to Zone B,\n\n212\n00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:03.156\nin this case here, this is an appliance\nnot an ASA that I'm looking at.\n\n213\n00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:05.241\nThey're saying that if it's\ncoming from Zone A to Zone B,\n\n214\n00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:07.636\nthat was probably their egress to\ningress or something like that.\n\n215\n00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:10.238\nThese are just names of interfaces.\n\n216\n00:10:10.238 --> 00:10:13.396\nOkay, it's Adobe we're gonna trust it.\n\n217\n00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:16.959\nWow, so anything that's coming\nform these different zones, and\n\n218\n00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.642\nit's going from B to A,\nA to A, and B to B and so on.\n\n219\n00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:22.910\nWe're actually trusting Adobe and\nit's not even saying go through.\n\n220\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.462\nSo notice all these trusts\nthey set up at the very top.\n\n221\n00:10:26.462 --> 00:10:27.738\nThis is pretty intense.\n\n222\n00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:31.549\nNotice what else, they did the same thing\nI didn't do or I didn't do what they did,\n\n223\n00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:34.665\nand they didn't log this,\nbecause we're trusting this traffic.\n\n224\n00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.453\nI don't even wanna hear about it, right?\n\n225\n00:10:36.453 --> 00:10:39.322\nJust trust it and now, look at,\nthis one's a little bit more intense.\n\n226\n00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:43.177\nThis is saying,\nif you're going from A to A and B to B.\n\n227\n00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.763\n[NOISE] Jump.\n\n228\n00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:48.250\n[NOISE] Someone went in there.\n\n229\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.968\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:51.116\n>> Someone else is in there playing\n\n231\n00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:51.756\nwith something.\n\n232\n00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:55.076\nAll right so,\nI'm just in a demo pot at Cisco.\n\n233\n00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:57.980\nBut, anyways,\nlet me go back in here and take a look.\n\n234\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.970\nIf I'm going from Zone A to Zone A and\nZone B to Zone B and\n\n235\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.880\nthese destinations networks.\n\n236\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.300\nSo these are actually global\nIP addresses aren't they?\n\n237\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.988\nSo we're actually saying if they're coming\nfrom this source network which is global\n\n238\n00:11:11.988 --> 00:11:14.469\nIP to these and\nthe destination as web ports.\n\n239\n00:11:14.469 --> 00:11:17.569\nNow this is an object, and I have to look\nin this object to see what it is, but\n\n240\n00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:21.043\nit's probably like 80 and 443 or something\nlike that, but it says web ports.\n\n241\n00:11:21.043 --> 00:11:23.100\nThis is an object they created,\nan object group.\n\n242\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.087\nI'm gonna say it's a group.\n\n243\n00:11:24.087 --> 00:11:25.736\nWe're gonna trust that traffic.\n\n244\n00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:28.499\nThat's pretty broad right here, I guess.\n\n245\n00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:29.055\nRight?\n\n246\n00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:33.010\nAnd they're saying also if we're\ncoming from this ten network right?\n\n247\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.447\nLook at all this traffic we're trusting.\n\n248\n00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:37.513\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith trusting traffic.\n\n249\n00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:39.905\nIt stops any latency.\n\n250\n00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:41.646\nIt makes it go relatively quickly.\n\n251\n00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:45.612\nThey just have a lot of trusted\ntraffic here don't they.\n\n252\n00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:46.726\nNow let's get down here.\n\n253\n00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:48.863\nThey're doing a lot of\ninteractive blocking.\n\n254\n00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:51.115\nAll right, so\nwe'll take a quick look down here.\n\n255\n00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:54.296\nAnd so now we just have, okay,\nsorry, let me try that again.\n\n256\n00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.535\nNow we just have some allow rules.\n\n257\n00:11:56.535 --> 00:11:57.275\nAnd I can't get there.\n\n258\n00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:57.775\nCome on.\n\n259\n00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:01.620\nThere.\n\n260\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.612\nSo now here's the deal, here's some allow\nrules and there's only, look at this,\n\n261\n00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:07.707\nthis shield means that it's an IPS policy.\n\n262\n00:12:07.707 --> 00:12:09.008\nSo they have an IPS policy.\n\n263\n00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:11.608\nJust cuz it's an allow rule,\nwe're not really allowing anything.\n\n264\n00:12:11.608 --> 00:12:15.560\nThe only reason we're allowing it, we're\ngonna allow it to go down to this next.\n\n265\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.513\nNotice they created a new heading here.\n\n266\n00:12:18.513 --> 00:12:20.825\nBecause they're administratively\nputting these together so\n\n267\n00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:22.883\nwe can clump them together,\nso we can understand them.\n\n268\n00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:27.662\nThey're saying, well these are web malware\ncontrol, right, and these are my rules for\n\n269\n00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:28.970\nregional controls.\n\n270\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.760\nThis is a really great example of\na complex access control policy,\n\n271\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.090\nwhere we're using those headings to help\nus administrate this very complex rule.\n\n272\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.750\nOkay, so it's basically putting\nsome sort of description on them.\n\n273\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.050\nBut notice the shield means\nthere's an IPS policy.\n\n274\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.900\nThis right here means\nthere's a file policy.\n\n275\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.850\nI can't tell what these are.\n\n276\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.860\nI can see which one it\nis by clicking on it,\n\n277\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.030\nthen I'd have to go out to the file\npolicy and see what it does.\n\n278\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.320\nNotice what they're doing here, though.\n\n279\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.650\nThey're logging all of these, aren't they?\n\n280\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.603\nThis is very important, okay?\n\n281\n00:13:00.603 --> 00:13:05.087\nAnd these down here are interactive\nblock and these are HTTP.\n\n282\n00:13:05.087 --> 00:13:08.562\nOne of the things that I didn't show you\nand I guess I need to go back because I\n\n283\n00:13:08.562 --> 00:13:11.580\ntotally spaced this and\nthis is very important.\n\n284\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.032\nWe're applying the policies here.\n\n285\n00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:15.241\nThis is gonna take a second.\n\n286\n00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:18.571\nNow we can see our tasks status\nhere as a supply and this is great.\n\n287\n00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:23.146\nSaying hey,\nI've got two waiting here on my device.\n\n288\n00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:26.540\nAnd the reason is I've got two,\nI'm applying it to two pods.\n\n289\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.120\nAnd so you can see my health policy,\nmy access control policies.\n\n290\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.850\nNow look at this guy here.\n\n291\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.790\nLook at this right here,\nnetwork discovery policy failed to apply.\n\n292\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.690\nDevice has wrong start up version.\n\n293\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.210\nMy God, we've gotta call Cisco.\n\n294\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.275\nThe world has ended I have\nthe wrong start up version.\n\n295\n00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:44.183\nI'm going to show you why this and\nyou don't want to panic when you see this,\n\n296\n00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:46.469\nI'm going to show you why this\noccurred and how to fix that.\n\n297\n00:13:46.469 --> 00:13:49.562\nAll right, so I really came\nout here to show you that, but\n\n298\n00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.977\nI want to show you something else,\nsomething I didn't do, and\n\n299\n00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:56.197\nI need to create a two rule now and\nI skipped one tab in here and\n\n300\n00:13:56.197 --> 00:14:00.451\nit's very important so we're going to\ncreate another rule and once I do this my\n\n301\n00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:04.413\naccess control policies need to be\nupdated once again but that's fine.\n\n302\n00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:10.891\nAll right, so I'm going to say block\nall non work related websites.\n\n303\n00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:14.281\n[LAUGH] This is awesome.\n\n304\n00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:15.001\nIt's too long.\n\n305\n00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:19.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Block all websites.\n\n306\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.910\nI like that.\n\n307\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.550\nLet's see if I can do this.\n\n308\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.520\nNon work websites.\n\n309\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.360\nThat works.\n\n310\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.100\nAnd we're just going to do a block.\n\n311\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.270\nWe're not going to give\nan interactive block.\n\n312\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.355\nWe're just going to say no.\n\n313\n00:14:29.355 --> 00:14:32.350\nIf it doesn't have to do with what\nwe're working on, you can't go there.\n\n314\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.000\nSo let's come over here.\n\n315\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.531\nThis URL shows up here.\n\n316\n00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:37.180\nIf I click on this, it's going to come up.\n\n317\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.925\nIf I don't have the license, it's going to\nsay, hey, you don't have a URL license.\n\n318\n00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:41.780\nAll right?\nAnd in this case, I do, but\n\n319\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.200\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n320\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.996\nAnd here's that object that I\ncreated in that applications,\n\n321\n00:14:45.996 --> 00:14:48.268\nnotice it shows up here,\nwhen we did the objects.\n\n322\n00:14:48.268 --> 00:14:51.408\nNow, I have some customers that say,\nI don't wanna buy the URL filter, but\n\n323\n00:14:51.408 --> 00:14:53.220\nI still wanna filter URLs.\n\n324\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:53.760\nWe can do it.\n\n325\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.910\nIt's just a lot more work.\n\n326\n00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.880\nYou go into the applications and\nyou just type them in one by one.\n\n327\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.640\nSo, it's a little bit more work but\nyou can do it.\n\n328\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.870\nIt saves you a little money.\n\n329\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.180\n>> And if you were going to be blocking\neverything except work related sites,\n\n330\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.400\nyou'd pretty much have to\ncurate that list anyway.\n\n331\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.140\nSo, I guess you could go that route.\n\n332\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.090\nIt'd be a lot of work.\n\n333\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.219\n>> It's an unbelievable amount of work,\nand the reason that we choose this\n\n334\n00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:16.527\nis because these, again, are objects\nin here that Cisco's gonna update.\n\n335\n00:15:16.527 --> 00:15:19.727\nThe thing is, these are categories that\nCisco has, it's like 88 categories, and\n\n336\n00:15:19.727 --> 00:15:21.116\nwe don't even know what's in them.\n\n337\n00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:22.788\nThey won't even tell you what's in them,\nright?\n\n338\n00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:25.249\nAnd there's other things\nin here that they block.\n\n339\n00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:27.803\nChild porn and all this other stuff,\nthey don't even show in here, right?\n\n340\n00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:28.406\nIt's not even in here.\n\n341\n00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:29.847\nIt's just automatically blocked.\n\n342\n00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:34.437\nSo, in this case here, I'm gonna say Annie\nURL so we can look through here because I\n\n343\n00:15:34.437 --> 00:15:38.110\ncan do something like,\ngosh man these guys on our marketing team,\n\n344\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.032\nthey're all single and\nthey just won't get away from farmers.com.\n\n345\n00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:43.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean I just see them out there\n\n346\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.639\nall the time, because we work in Iowa or\nwhatever, farmers.com.\n\n347\n00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:51.540\nSo I'm gonna say I wanna block all dating\nsites, all right so I'm gonna pick this.\n\n348\n00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.609\nNow here's one of the things I can do.\n\n349\n00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:57.392\nI can say I'm gonna let him go to,\nI don't mind, I don't know.\n\n350\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:15:58.900\nWhat's a dating site?\n\n351\n00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.105\nI've been married so long I have no idea.\n\n352\n00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:02.865\n>> Cupid.com.\nThey have the commercials, right?\n\n353\n00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:05.314\n>> All right, or match.com.\n\n354\n00:16:05.314 --> 00:16:07.868\nAll right, so\nsay we well know and are fine.\n\n355\n00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:10.552\nSo we're gonna say hey,\nanything that's not well-known,\n\n356\n00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:14.420\nanything that's high risk to well-known,\nso I'm gonna add to what I'm blocking, and\n\n357\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.800\nnotice it's blocking one through four.\n\n358\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.940\nSo if it's well known, and\nwe know that it's good, so\n\n359\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.060\nthey'd probably be able to\nget to Farmersonly.com or\n\n360\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.870\nChristian Mingle or Mash.com, or\nsomething like that in this case here.\n\n361\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.000\nBut we could change this and say that we\ndon't want anything and choose any, right?\n\n362\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.077\nNow, in this case here I want to come\ndown here now, I can add one, right?\n\n363\n00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:37.020\nWe can always add a new\nURL object in here.\n\n364\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.140\nBut I might just come back here and\nsay I want any.\n\n365\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.990\nNow it doesn't allow me to do all of these\nand say all of them of any, so I can't\n\n366\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:50.166\nsay any, any, any cuz when I do it's\ngonna say, it's gonna come back and say.\n\n367\n00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.779\nIt did do it in this case.\n\n368\n00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:55.120\nOkay, so no this one's pretty good.\n\n369\n00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.847\nSo I blocked, and\nit gave me an error here.\n\n370\n00:16:56.847 --> 00:16:59.802\nSo, this is that triangle I was talking\nabout it's preempted by rule five,\n\n371\n00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:01.426\nthe IPS and file pulsing, that's fine.\n\n372\n00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:04.677\nIn this case here I was just\ngiving you an example of the URL.\n\n373\n00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:08.466\nAnd now, I gotta be honest with you,\nif you did do this,\n\n374\n00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:11.218\nyou will get some calls from everybody.\n\n375\n00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:13.490\nBecause, what happened is you blocked CNN.\n\n376\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.830\nYou know, name a site, you blocked it.\n\n377\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.815\nAll right.\n\n378\n00:17:17.815 --> 00:17:21.722\nSo in this case here, if I look at these\nURL's and I look at all these categories,\n\n379\n00:17:21.722 --> 00:17:25.745\nyou might want to do more things like,\nthey got abortion here, abused, adults and\n\n380\n00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:26.510\npornography.\n\n381\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.570\nOkay, that might be good and\nwe're going to say any adult and\n\n382\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.350\npornography maybe we\njust pick some of these.\n\n383\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.382\nMaybe we let them go to options.\n\n384\n00:17:34.382 --> 00:17:36.820\nI don't know what cheating means but\nit sounds bad.\n\n385\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.548\n[LAUGH] Cult and a colt,\nnah we don't want any devil worshipers, so\n\n386\n00:17:40.548 --> 00:17:44.080\nall right confirm spam sources,\neh I like that one too.\n\n387\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.420\nDating right we picked that one already,\nno dating.\n\n388\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.737\nNo one on our site, we don't want anybody\nout dating we want them here working.\n\n389\n00:17:53.737 --> 00:17:54.860\nRight?\n>> no distractions.\n\n390\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.760\n>> And here's the one that will\nreally get your calls going.\n\n391\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.590\nI'm gonna say social network.\n\n392\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.960\nSo now you got Twitter, YouTube, Facebook.\n\n393\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.610\nI don't even know them all.\n\n394\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.640\nI don't get on any of those or all those\nare gone, now, can I choose those by hand?\n\n395\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.160\nI can.\n\n396\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.950\nI can come to this Application tab,\ntype in Facebook I can type in, so\n\n397\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.990\nlets go ahead and do that.\n\n398\n00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.720\nSo I got that here and\nI've got my URL filtering.\n\n399\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.673\nAnd I can come over here and\nsay, hey, look.\n\n400\n00:18:22.673 --> 00:18:23.280\nThis one's pretty good, Facebook.\n\n401\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.380\nNotice there's a lot.\n\n402\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.301\nNow look at all this stuff,\nnow if you don't know what it is they have\n\n403\n00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:33.140\nthis information that says well\nwhat's Facebook send to email?\n\n404\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.530\nI haven't quite heard of this.\n\n405\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.035\nThis is saying, it's an action that sends\nan email on Facebook saying they've got\n\n406\n00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:38.946\na personal message.\n\n407\n00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:41.853\nMaybe you say no, no we're a business\nrelated, no one can send emails so\n\n408\n00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:43.440\nmaybe we wanna block all of this stuff.\n\n409\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.900\nSo we can just block all of Facebook right\nnow but hold on, we could sit there and\n\n410\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.121\nbe a little more succinct.\n\n411\n00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:51.606\nWe could say, hey look,\nif it's high and very high,\n\n412\n00:18:51.606 --> 00:18:55.920\nand it's got,\nbusiness relevance is low and very low.\n\n413\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.889\nNow, we'll take Facebook, and we don't\nsee, it didn't match any of those, so\n\n414\n00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:04.793\nwe can get rid of the business\nrelevance and say it's high risk.\n\n415\n00:19:04.793 --> 00:19:09.573\nAnd it's just Facebook application,\nsome might say very high, let's see if it,\n\n416\n00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:10.540\nit gave us more.\n\n417\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.725\nSo now I'm going to click very high,\nin high and very high,\n\n418\n00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:15.464\nwith let's see low business relevancy\nlet's see if something comes up.\n\n419\n00:19:15.464 --> 00:19:17.999\nThere we go.\nNow, I'm sitting there going okay I went\n\n420\n00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:23.382\nto Facebook and I'mm just taking out high\nrisk, low business relevance, all right?\n\n421\n00:19:23.382 --> 00:19:26.055\nAnd then here's my URLs I\nput those in here,\n\n422\n00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:30.840\nnow I'm going to be straight with you,\nthis URL filter works most of the time.\n\n423\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.424\nWe had to go out and test it.\n\n424\n00:19:32.424 --> 00:19:35.093\nAnd we're trying to go\ntake it out at a company.\n\n425\n00:19:35.093 --> 00:19:37.960\nWe're trying different things\nlike the dating sites, and\n\n426\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.692\nwe're trying pornography sites.\n\n427\n00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:43.105\nSomeone can get to Playboy, but they can't\nget to Penthouse, or something like that.\n\n428\n00:19:43.105 --> 00:19:44.686\nAnd some of them work sometimes,\nand some of them don't.\n\n429\n00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:47.864\n>> If you have refined tastes, you\ngotta limit it to the particular sites.\n\n430\n00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:48.610\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n431\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.688\n>> That's understandable.\n\n432\n00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:53.190\n>> So my point is,\nit worked most of the time.\n\n433\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.580\nAll right so\nyou just gotta keep that in mind.\n\n434\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.540\nAll right so I am gonna go ahead and\nadd that, and I'm just gonna cancel this.\n\n435\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.742\nI was just giving an example here.\n\n436\n00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.042\nI wanna cancel.\n\n437\n00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:05.015\nCancel, yes.\n\n438\n00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:08.608\nAll right, so we go ahead and we save\nthat and I'm not even gonna leave this,\n\n439\n00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:09.911\nit's not even gonna work.\n\n440\n00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:12.495\nit's telling me right here, hey you kind\nof screwed up, you've got to move this up.\n\n441\n00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:15.377\nSo to make this work I'd have to move\nit up one above my IPS policy and\n\n442\n00:20:15.377 --> 00:20:17.087\nthat's kind of what it's telling me.\n\n443\n00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:22.485\nAnd now it'll go ahead and work.\n\n444\n00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:23.165\nIn this case here, we're fine.\n\n445\n00:20:23.165 --> 00:20:26.345\nI already got it, notice when I saw that\nit said show warnings, I still got one.\n\n446\n00:20:26.345 --> 00:20:28.680\nAnd let's go ahead and take a look,\nthis is an interesting one here.\n\n447\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.460\nBecause now it's not giving me a triangle.\n\n448\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.296\nIt's not saying hey you've got\na serious problem here but\n\n449\n00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:33.655\nyou've got something you need to look at.\n\n450\n00:20:33.655 --> 00:20:36.740\nAnd let's take a look\nat this warning here.\n\n451\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.900\nThis rule may be skipped until\nthe application URL can be\n\n452\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.680\ndetermined for rule five.\n\n453\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.430\nBlock all mod will work with web sites.\n\n454\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.430\nSo at this point here we're\nchecking out the URL,\n\n455\n00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.000\nseeing if it's going to be blocked.\n\n456\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.860\nAnd then we'll come down here and\ncheck our IPS.\n\n457\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.498\nWe probably wanna be careful here,\n\n458\n00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:51.787\nour IPS policy probably is gonna be\nmore important than our URL filter.\n\n459\n00:20:51.787 --> 00:20:53.990\nThat's you're decision you have to make.\n\n460\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.598\nOkay?\nSo at this point here, we saved and\n\n461\n00:20:55.598 --> 00:20:58.575\napplied it, and when we come back,\nwe're gonna do some event analysis,\n\n462\n00:20:58.575 --> 00:21:00.390\nand see what this does for us.\n\n463\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.810\n>> All right well that was definitely\nsome exciting stuff there.\n\n464\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.350\nWe got a chance to see all the different\nrules, and some great advanced examples,\n\n465\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.850\nthanks for showing us those Todd.\n\n466\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.840\nAnd I know what happens to me a lot of\ntimes when I watch shows, even like some\n\n467\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.150\nof ours, is you see a basic, general\nexample and then you're like great,\n\n468\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.850\nbut in my work I need xyz scenario,\nwhich is a lot different.\n\n469\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.160\nAnd so I think you did a great job showing\nus all the different options in there\n\n470\n00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.430\nto be able to\n\n471\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.780\nreally achieve whatever our particular-\n>> Yeah.\n\n472\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.360\n>> Our particular goal is.\n\n473\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.109\n>> And just remember,\nas we got down to the bottom,\n\n474\n00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:28.081\nthere was still that default action,\nwasn't there?\n\n475\n00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:30.498\nSo and our default action was hey,\nif you've gotten this far,\n\n476\n00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.554\nwe're gonna kill you now.\n\n477\n00:21:31.554 --> 00:21:32.511\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n478\n00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:34.724\n[LAUGH] good job on getting\ndown this far now you die.\n\n479\n00:21:34.724 --> 00:21:35.530\n>> Congratulations.\n\n480\n00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.085\n>> Yeah.\n\n481\n00:21:36.085 --> 00:21:38.192\n>> All right, well, ladies and\ngentleman that's a good spot for\n\n482\n00:21:38.192 --> 00:21:38.957\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n483\n00:21:38.957 --> 00:21:42.378\nStay tuned because we've got more\nFire Power content coming down the road.\n\n484\n00:21:42.378 --> 00:21:45.953\nBut for now, signing off for\nITPro TV, I'm Dom Fisette.\n\n485\n00:21:45.953 --> 00:21:46.909\n>> And I'm Todd Lamley.\n\n486\n00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:48.452\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n487\n00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:54.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.010\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.540\nI'm your host Don Pezet Back again with\nanother episode of Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n5\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.980\nAnd in this episode we're gonna continue\nour pattern of talking about policies.\n\n6\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.680\nI know what you're thinking, good, gosh,\nhow many policies do we have to cover.\n\n7\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.397\nWell, this next one is, is probably one\nof the last ones we actually have to deal\n\n8\n00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:36.353\nwith, is the Network Discovery Policy.\n\n9\n00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:38.507\nSo we're gonna get a chance to\nsee how to get that set up.\n\n10\n00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:42.395\nGet our management center working,\nour network really all tied together.\n\n11\n00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.418\nIt's a pretty important piece and\nit'll leave us in a really good spot for\n\n12\n00:00:45.418 --> 00:00:46.510\nprotecting our network.\n\n13\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.177\nSo, back to help us on this episode we've\ngot Mr. Todd Lammle in the studio with us.\n\n14\n00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:52.625\nAnd Todd,\nlet's see some network discovery.\n\n15\n00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.730\n>> Yup, and Don is right that we're\ngetting close to the end of our policies.\n\n16\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.320\nThere are certainly a couple more but\nthey're optional, and\n\n17\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.950\nI'll go through them, because you might\nwanna do them, because they are advanced.\n\n18\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.150\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthe network analysis policy correlation\n\n19\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.690\npolicy, certainly.\n\n20\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.670\nBut those are more advanced and, honestly,\n\n21\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.330\nif you didn't wanna do them,\nyou leave them alone.\n\n22\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.480\nBut the four I'm showing you,\nso the file policy,\n\n23\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.180\nyour IPS policy, your access control\npolicy, network discovery policy.\n\n24\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.605\nThese are the ones that we wanna hit.\n\n25\n00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.175\nRight?\nSo, these are the ones I teach my\n\n26\n00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:20.710\ncustomers.\n\n27\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950\nI come in here and I'm doing it\njust like I did on this video.\n\n28\n00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.539\nI come in here and say,\nfirst off I need your security policy.\n\n29\n00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.147\nOkay, oh you don't have that,\nlet me help you write that and\n\n30\n00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:30.050\nI need an extra zero on\nmy PO because of that.\n\n31\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.620\nNow that being said,\nnow we do our file policy.\n\n32\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.670\nThen we do our IPS policy.\n\n33\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.692\nThen we do an access control policy.\n\n34\n00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:38.689\nNow well come back into our\nnetwork discovery policy.\n\n35\n00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.078\nNow, can I create my access control\npolicy and implement that, and\n\n36\n00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:43.573\nthen add my IPS and follow up?\n\n37\n00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:46.343\nYes, you can do that, I'm just\nshowing you the most efficient way\n\n38\n00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:49.283\nthat I've learned to do it but\nknock yourself out any way you wanna go.\n\n39\n00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:52.294\nBut, we don't want to do our\nnetwork discovery polity\n\n40\n00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:54.854\nuntil we have access\ncontrol policy applied.\n\n41\n00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:58.589\nNow we saw that when we did the task\nstatus last time when we saw hey,\n\n42\n00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:01.482\nwe got an arrow,\nnetwork discovery, long snark.\n\n43\n00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:03.710\nThat was, we didn't have our\naccess control policy applied.\n\n44\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.450\nSo it's out there going hey, I'm trying to\napply but this guy is not configured, and\n\n45\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.010\nwe get this weird error.\n\n46\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.750\nSo we're gonna go ahead and fix that, but\n\n47\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.030\nsomething you're gonna get until we're\ngonna apply our access control policy.\n\n48\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.916\nSo I did a really good logical steps here\nIPS, file policy, IPS policy, access\n\n49\n00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:24.329\ncontrol policy, created our rules, you are\nall filtering, everything we wanted to do.\n\n50\n00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.945\nSet our default action when it got\nthe end, which is basically die a slow\n\n51\n00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:31.456\nmiserable death, if you've gotten\nthis far now you're gonna die.\n\n52\n00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:35.090\nBut the fact is that's where we're at and\nnow we can add our network discovery.\n\n53\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.120\nIt's not gonna affect what we've done.\n\n54\n00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.160\nOur access control policy is out\nthere working we're dropping traffic,\n\n55\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.920\nwe're allowing it.\n\n56\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.766\nWe're monitoring it.\n\n57\n00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:42.636\nAll the stuff that we set up.\n\n58\n00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:43.923\nAll of that's occurring.\n\n59\n00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:46.470\nThis being us playing with these policies.\n\n60\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.730\nAnd the rest of these policies don't\nhave anything to do with that.\n\n61\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.791\nAnd we don't have to go and\n\n62\n00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.792\napply our access control policy after\nchanging what we're gonna do now.\n\n63\n00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.091\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n64\n00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:59.316\nAnd we're gonna go to Policies\n> Network Discovery Policy.\n\n65\n00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.352\nSo we have Files >\nIntrusion > Access Control.\n\n66\n00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:03.904\nWe're looking good, we're dropping\ntraffic, we're getting events.\n\n67\n00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:04.528\nRight?\nAnd\n\n68\n00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:06.230\nwe're gonna take a look\nat that in a second.\n\n69\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.490\nBut before we go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.120\nlook through all these events I wanna do\nour network discovery and discuss this.\n\n71\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.910\nNow this is our FireSIGHT technology,\nthis is our policy for FireSIGHT.\n\n72\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.347\nAnd, yeah, I'm gonna leave that,\nI didn't save that.\n\n73\n00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:21.245\n[COUGH] We made some changes with URL\nfilter and I didn't change it right.\n\n74\n00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.995\nSo, now when you go into a mox\nyou're gonna see that this\n\n75\n00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.315\nis configured by default.\n\n76\n00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:26.545\nIt is enabled by default.\n\n77\n00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:31.316\nAnd basically it's all zero slash zero and\ncolon, colon, zero, slash, zero four IPV6,\n\n78\n00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:34.945\nbasically any IPV4, IPV6 address\nwe're gonna find in FireSIGHT.\n\n79\n00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:36.813\nAnd notice I deleted that.\n\n80\n00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:38.286\nI took that out of here already.\n\n81\n00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:40.878\nThe fact is we don't want that in here and\n\n82\n00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:45.243\nthe reason why is because anytime\nsomeone goes out to the Internet.\n\n83\n00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:47.552\nFireSIGHT is gonna say oh, that host.\n\n84\n00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:50.500\nFor example, we see a lot 8.8.8.8.\n\n85\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.149\nOh, what is that?\n\n86\n00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.851\nWell I'm gonna put that in my database and\nI'm gonna learn all about it,\n\n87\n00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.954\nall those protocols and\nthose applications, really?\n\n88\n00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:56.904\nWe don't really need that.\n\n89\n00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.476\nRight?\nI think you guys understand what\n\n90\n00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.003\nthat one is.\n\n91\n00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:03.286\nAnyway, so in this case here we're out of\ndate, because I was kinda playing with it.\n\n92\n00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.376\nBut before we go ahead and create this and\n\n93\n00:04:05.376 --> 00:04:08.022\nin here I'm just gonna add\nmy internal networks and\n\n94\n00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:11.608\nsay I want my FireSIGHT database\non my internal enterprise network.\n\n95\n00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:15.600\nI don't want anything past that,\nmaybe I don't need one of my DMZ.\n\n96\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.770\nTypically I probably want\nanything inside my Egress.\n\n97\n00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.316\nRight?\nBut\n\n98\n00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:22.072\nanyways let's take a look I\ngot first off the users, and\n\n99\n00:04:22.072 --> 00:04:25.827\nin this case here I'm saying,\ncollect these user logon and log-offs, and\n\n100\n00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:27.544\nthese are the default protocols.\n\n101\n00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:29.226\nI usually don't play with this.\n\n102\n00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:32.129\nHonestly, I might turn off the aim or\nsomething like that,\n\n103\n00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.533\nmaybe I even block AIM chat.\n\n104\n00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:36.767\nBut someone with an AIM handle of\nlike BigBubbaBear, or something,\n\n105\n00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:39.945\nthat doesn't really help you much\nfinding this guy, Bob in sales,\n\n106\n00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.200\nbecause who knows what\nhe does on the weekends.\n\n107\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.150\nBut the point is, ldap and\noracle and pop3 and\n\n108\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.000\nall this, we're gonna capture this,\nwe're gonna understand these users.\n\n109\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.500\nBut I'll show you something more powerful.\n\n110\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.460\nSo I usually just leave this\nscreen alone and let it go.\n\n111\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.040\nBut on this one here let's take a look.\n\n112\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.422\nIn this one we're gonna make some changes.\n\n113\n00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:03.328\nFirst off, the capture banner means as\nthe file comes in we wanna get vendor\n\n114\n00:05:03.328 --> 00:05:05.686\ninformation, where does this come from|?\n\n115\n00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:09.830\nCisco, Oracle, whatever and so\nyes, I wanna capture banners.\n\n116\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.042\nAnd this is not enabled by default, but\nI had already gone in and changed this.\n\n117\n00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:18.733\nSo capture banners, yes, and\nthe update interval is 3,600 seconds.\n\n118\n00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.624\nI'd change it to ten, why?\n\n119\n00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:24.256\nBecause I'm in a demo, I'm doing this\nvideo now, and I'm doing classes.\n\n120\n00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.308\nAnd I want my FireSIGHT data to go,\ngo, go,\n\n121\n00:05:26.308 --> 00:05:28.643\nI wanna gather information\nrelatively quickly.\n\n122\n00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:32.584\nI probably wouldn't change it from\nthe default of 3,600 in real life,\n\n123\n00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:36.847\nbecause you're gonna get so much FireSIGHT\ndata, it's gonna fill up your logs.\n\n124\n00:05:36.847 --> 00:05:41.989\nOkay, now, this conflict setting,\nthis ones kinda important to understand.\n\n125\n00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:43.869\nActually, everything I say is\nkind of important to understand.\n\n126\n00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:44.470\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.978\n>> So we'll just say that's the defacto\n\n128\n00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.825\nfrom now on and\nwe'll not say that ever again.\n\n129\n00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:51.704\nAnd this is disabled by default,\nbut notice there's on this pod,\n\n130\n00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:54.209\nI said generate identity conflict, why?\n\n131\n00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.876\nBecause remember,\nFireSIGHT is a passive technology.\n\n132\n00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.941\nWe only go out there,\nfind out what the host is.\n\n133\n00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:02.947\nWe don't scan the host and find out if\nthey actually have vulnerabilities.\n\n134\n00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:06.011\nBut in this case here,\nlook down here, I have Nmap on here.\n\n135\n00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.341\nRemember, we're in an open Linux or\nopen Snort.\n\n136\n00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:12.590\nSo we can allow third party apps,\nthat's what's so great about this.\n\n137\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.248\nSo now I can go out there and do active\nscanning and now I can find out if there's\n\n138\n00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:19.310\ntruly vulnerabilities on each and\nevery host in my network.\n\n139\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.310\nYou know, thousands and\nthousands hosts, I can scan them all.\n\n140\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.574\nNow that being said, it says well,\nif I have a conflict,\n\n141\n00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:30.005\nin other words FireSIGHT learned it,\nand in this example, Nmap learned it.\n\n142\n00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:31.675\nAnd so I'm gonna say what should I do?\n\n143\n00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:36.944\nSo if there's a conflict,\nI wanna generate the identity conflict.\n\n144\n00:06:36.944 --> 00:06:37.814\nWhat do I keep?\n\n145\n00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.460\nThe active or the passive?\n\n146\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.245\nAnd so we have to make that decision\nat this point if we're using both.\n\n147\n00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:45.758\nIn this case here, I said, no,\nno I want to keep Nmap and\n\n148\n00:06:45.758 --> 00:06:47.748\nwe will take out the fire\nsite information.\n\n149\n00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:48.501\nRight?\n\n150\n00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:49.347\nWith FireSIGHT found.\n\n151\n00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:51.990\nAll right, vulnerabilities to use for\nimpact assessment.\n\n152\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.620\nI usually don't change these,\nI just leave these as yes.\n\n153\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd same thing with\nIndications of Compromise.\n\n154\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.068\nNow the Indications of\nCompromise tell us that, hey,\n\n155\n00:07:01.068 --> 00:07:04.057\nsomething happened with this host,\nwe think it's vulnerable.\n\n156\n00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:05.623\nAnd this IOCs are very important.\n\n157\n00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:10.083\nWe'll get a little bit more into those\nlater on, but, and we'll take a look them,\n\n158\n00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:13.270\nbecause these are kind of the things\nthat give us our zero day\n\n159\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.868\nattack anomalies that tell us hey,\nsomething is really going on.\n\n160\n00:07:16.868 --> 00:07:19.711\nI'm getting this IOC pop,\npop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.\n\n161\n00:07:19.711 --> 00:07:21.734\nAnd then I'm watching this and\nthis is here.\n\n162\n00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:25.619\nSo you may want to say get these IOCs\nagain, something in RD is going on and\n\n163\n00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.996\nit's creating this indication\nof compromise on so and so, and\n\n164\n00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:32.390\nwe know it's not a compromise,\nso I can go in here and disable.\n\n165\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.119\nIn this case, I'm gonna let him go.\n\n166\n00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:37.966\nIf you guys use Netflow on your routers,\nor switches on your Cisco network and\n\n167\n00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:41.754\nrouters and switches of course,\nthen we can gather Netflow information and\n\n168\n00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:44.318\nimport it into here into\nthe FireSIGHT databases.\n\n169\n00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:45.466\nVery cool stuff.\n\n170\n00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:49.277\nAll right, all events are enabled and in\nhere this gives me my FireSIGHT database\n\n171\n00:07:49.277 --> 00:07:52.709\nand what happens when the FireSIGHT\ndatabase gets full, what do I do?.\n\n172\n00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:56.149\nWell, I drop the old host out,\nthat's the default and I would leave this.\n\n173\n00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:59.438\nAnd the host time out is\nabout seven days by default.\n\n174\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:04.101\nSo we're saying so if a host is in there,\nwe remember that for seven days and\n\n175\n00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.370\nwe'll drop it out.\n\n176\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.060\nWe can shorten that if we have\na heck of a lot of users, but\n\n177\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.880\nyou have to have over 50,000 hosts and\n50,000 users.\n\n178\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.850\nSo, it's very possible that you still\ncould fill it up, you'd be surprised\n\n179\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.770\nhow fast this fills up, especially if\nyou don't change your network policy.\n\n180\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.080\nSo let's go back here to my network.\n\n181\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.090\nIt actually put in my\ninternal networks here.\n\n182\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.120\nSo I'm going to say add rule and\nfirst off, there's a discover and\n\n183\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.560\nthere's an exclude.\n\n184\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.610\nSo when I first started doing this\na few years back I was like, first off,\n\n185\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.590\nI want to make sure I discover, I want\nto choose this, I want to say hosts.\n\n186\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.710\nAnd the reason I come here is I say,\nabsolutely I wanna know about users.\n\n187\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.710\nI wanna know about all my users from\nmy AD I get that from ALDP from AD and\n\n188\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.040\nmy source fire user we'll\nshow those in a second.\n\n189\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.290\nSo notice these are now on, it's not\non by default, now I turned them on, so\n\n190\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.820\nthis is one of the reasons\nyou come in here.\n\n191\n00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.790\nNow notice this I have my object RC1918,\nthese are my internal networks, so\n\n192\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.270\nI'm gonna say add, and\nthen I'm pretty much done.\n\n193\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.010\nBut let's talk about this exclude for\none second.\n\n194\n00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.150\nI could use zones and ports exclusions,\nthose are interfaces and ports.\n\n195\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.480\nNow what do I do n exclude?\n\n196\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.820\nThe answer is, it was pretty rare but I\ndid come across something that a customer,\n\n197\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.380\nwhere I ended up excluding it because they\nhad a, I think they were running a GLBP,\n\n198\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.460\nand they also had some\nserver load balancers.\n\n199\n00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.360\nIn other words they had virtual addresses.\n\n200\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.450\nNow, the virtual addresses aren't\ngoing to give me much information, and\n\n201\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.240\ncertainly not about the host behind it.\n\n202\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.060\nSo since we're doing some load\nbalancing protocols and these are,\n\n203\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.660\nI basically exclude\nthese virtual addresses.\n\n204\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.920\nThat's an example I found at\na customer that you would use for\n\n205\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.790\nan exclude inside FireSIGHT.\n\n206\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.470\nMost of the time I don't do it, but\nin this case here I found it necessary.\n\n207\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.720\nSo in this case here we're gonna make it\ndiscover, And we're gonna do RC 1918.\n\n208\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.490\nThat's again why I created this object.\n\n209\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.770\nNow, boom, boom, boom,\nI'm using it in different policies.\n\n210\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.980\nAnd, I'm done.\n\n211\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.770\nBoom, I'm done and we're gonna go out and\napply this like do some advanced,\n\n212\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.970\nso really this is the easiest\npolicy you can create.\n\n213\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.300\nYou go in there and\nput your internal networks.\n\n214\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.100\nYou can leave the Advanced tab alone even,\nand we'll go out there and\n\n215\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.120\nwatch this happen.\n\n216\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.110\nAnd now we'll see that we don't get\nan error because we're not gonna get\n\n217\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.800\nlong start version.\n\n218\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.450\nWhy?\nBecause we have our access control\n\n219\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.650\npolicy applied now, right?, So\nlet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n220\n00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.030\n>> Now, when you were configuring that\nwe could obviously include everybody,\n\n221\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.530\nwhich is kind of what it\nwas doing by default.\n\n222\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.730\nAnd then you showed where\nyou could exclude also.\n\n223\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.490\n>> Yeah.\n\n224\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.360\n>> And if we exclude, what.\n\n225\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.590\n>> What happens to hosts that aren't\ndetected by the discovery protocol?\n\n226\n00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.380\nThey, I mean the security policy\nstill applies to them, right?\n\n227\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.380\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n228\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.070\nThis is just a database for\nadministrative, right?\n\n229\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.600\nAnd then it also allows us to gather\ninformation that our IPS policy,\n\n230\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.970\nFiresite will go out and\nmake rules to our IPS policy.\n\n231\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.230\nI don't have to have this, but\nit's extremely powerful tool and\n\n232\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.350\nyou absolutely wanna have it.\n\n233\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.830\nIt's not going to allow\nany host to get through,\n\n234\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.710\nnot with our access control policy where\nwe say you get to the end, we kill you.\n\n235\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.680\nSo, that's not gonna,\nthis isn't gonna help anyone do anything.\n\n236\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.510\nThis is gonna tell us who they are,\nand what they try to do.\n\n237\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.070\nSo when I see an event, I know that\nit's Bob in sales, I know who it is,\n\n238\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.955\nI know it's I see his net bio same,\nI see his LVAP name, when he's in the I\n\n239\n00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:08.300\nget Aldap information what department,\nhis phone number, and his login log offs.\n\n240\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.240\n>> So whereas normally I might\nsee this workstation went to\n\n241\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.210\na website that wasn't allowed,\n\n242\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.937\nnow I would see this workstation with\nthis user logged in went to the website.\n\n243\n00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.660\n[CROSSTALK] A lot more data.\n\n244\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.850\n>> There's another policy\nto be able to do that,\n\n245\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.850\nin other words what he's talking about is\nwe can create what's called a white list.\n\n246\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.740\nThat's a different policy\nunder correlations, but\n\n247\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.860\nbased on that what he's saying is, I get\na white list violation saying this host\n\n248\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.080\nwent somewhere we didn't want it to, or it\nran a protocol we told it it couldn't run.\n\n249\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.430\nWe get an alert, and now we know who\nit is, it's not just an IP address.\n\n250\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.460\nAnd that's the example he was making,\nand it's a very good example.\n\n251\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.210\nSo we can be extremely succinct here,\nas while I'm waiting for\n\n252\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.830\nthis to update and say, hey.\n\n253\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.370\nIf you're Bob is sales and\nyou ran Firefox, I told you not to.\n\n254\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.210\nAnd we give him a whitelist violation,\nand we know who it was.\n\n255\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.590\n>> So what would be an example\nwhere we'd use that exclude?\n\n256\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.416\nWould it be a device we didn't care about,\nlike a network printer?\n\n257\n00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:01.760\n>> No, no, no.\nYou'd wanna know all about that.\n\n258\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.570\nAgain, the example for this exclude is\na virtual address, so I'm doing load\n\n259\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.880\ndunks with a server and LVP with my\nrouter and it's not a real address.\n\n260\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.160\nIt's a virtual address, it gives us\ninformation about many devices but\n\n261\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.400\nit doesn't help me with FireSite and\n\n262\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.970\nthese virtual addresses will\nmaybe cause some problems for me.\n\n263\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.770\nThat's the only time I use an exclude.\n\n264\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.300\nSo there might be some other examples.\n\n265\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.180\nThat's just the ones I\nfound with my customers.\n\n266\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.060\nSo we can see down here that my network\ndiscovery did complete this time.\n\n267\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.600\nIt failed before,\n\n268\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.070\nbecause we now that we have our access\ncontrol policy, it's like I am happy.\n\n269\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.090\nI'm happy, I've discovered this,\nthis is awesome.\n\n270\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.080\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nput this out, this is completed.\n\n271\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.400\nAnd a lot of time,\nI don't know if you guys have noticed, but\n\n272\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.260\nI said remove completed jobs,\nin this case I'll remove failed jobs.\n\n273\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.010\nThis thing gets\n\n274\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.500\nkind of full relatively quickly\nbecause you're doing a lot of updates.\n\n275\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.670\nNow, that being said,\nwe've got everything done.\n\n276\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.170\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at what we've got done so far.\n\n277\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.622\nSo I'm here, there I am.\n\n278\n00:12:56.622 --> 00:13:00.720\nAll right, so here I am with my policies,\nand actually in\n\n279\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.990\na different pod where I created something\nand sent some events and so on.\n\n280\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.100\nAnother one that we had in the oven and\nwe pulled out.\n\n281\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.770\nIt's nice and baked.\n\n282\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.370\nAlright so we've got our file\npolicy let's go ahead I wanna show\n\n283\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.740\nyou the file policy that I did.\n\n284\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.270\nLet's go through our policies and then\nwe'll take a look at some fireside data.\n\n285\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.081\nI have 15 minutes to be able to do that.\n\n286\n00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:22.412\n[LAUGH] So\nlet's take a look at what I did here.\n\n287\n00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:25.400\nSo, here's my file policy and\nI want to show you,\n\n288\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.470\nnotice it's not showing up here and\nyou're like, what's going on?\n\n289\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.820\nWell, a lot of times it doesn't show up,\nI have to click this tab and then go back.\n\n290\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.180\nBut I want to click this anyways,\n\n291\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.840\nto make sure you guys understand\nthat I'm inspecting archives,\n\n292\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.380\nI'm saying it will block anything that\nis encrypted or has a password on it.\n\n293\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.480\nI'm not allowing that,\nI'm not saying you should do that, but\n\n294\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.600\nyou need to consider that.\n\n295\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.620\nAll right, now I want to come back\nto rules and I'll see my rules here.\n\n296\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.855\nNow, I'm being tough here\nbecause I'm in a demo pod.\n\n297\n00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:52.155\nSo, in other words, I'm pretty much\nblocking everything because it's fun.\n\n298\n00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:53.445\nSo, this is all fun.\n\n299\n00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:54.505\nIf you're in a demo pod, or\n\n300\n00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:59.745\nyou just want to have fun with your\nfriends in sales, sales calls you up and\n\n301\n00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:03.475\nyells at you because they couldn't\nget to Farmers only dot com.\n\n302\n00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:05.955\nSo I'll sell them, anyway,\nso I come in here and\n\n303\n00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:09.045\nnotice I click system files PDS and\nI'm blocking, so, I'm actually\n\n304\n00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:13.810\nnot blocking the files, I'm blocking\nthem if they have malware, though.\n\n305\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.510\nSo I'm gonna check system files,\nPDFs, offstock and its executables.\n\n306\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.270\nAnd I'm gonna block them,\nand I'm gonna store them.\n\n307\n00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.510\nThat's a really nice rule.\n\n308\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.910\nI think that's great.\n\n309\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.090\nI like that one very much.\n\n310\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.100\nNow, this one's a block with three sets.\n\n311\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.420\nWe're actually blocking them,\n\n312\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.250\nand I'm doing graphics\nencoded multimedia archives.\n\n313\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.782\nAll these are 100% blocked.\n\n314\n00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:34.050\nAll right, we're just blocking\nthe files and we're storing them,\n\n315\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.000\nand we're not even letting the user know.\n\n316\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.030\nNow, that all depends on how we set\nup our access control vaults if\n\n317\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.910\nthe user's going to know\nthat we blocked that or not.\n\n318\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.680\nMy thought pulse is pretty\ntight here isn't it?\n\n319\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.980\nOkay, under my intrusion pulse see,\nI basically, I set some things up.\n\n320\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.940\nI actually went in here and\nchose some certain normals, and\n\n321\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.400\nhere's how you do that.\n\n322\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.050\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n323\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.750\nI'm gonna show you something on\nwhat I did with this IPS policy.\n\n324\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.160\nSo I came in here and\nlet me come back over here for a second.\n\n325\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.570\nAnd, it was here.\n\n326\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.030\nSo what I did is I have\nsome attack machines and\n\n327\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.310\nthey are alerting on certain snort rules.\n\n328\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.610\nSo, basically I have my users,\n\n329\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.510\nsorry student whatever,\ncome in and base a look for\n\n330\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.440\ncertain snort rules and enable them and\nmake sure that they're dropping, right?\n\n331\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.060\nBased on the Callie machine that I'm\nusing is attacking these snort rules.\n\n332\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.060\nSo I am going to say MS0026, right?\n\n333\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.200\nSo I am going to look in here and\nI'm going to come up under rules.\n\n334\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.310\nI could do that from here, or\ndo my changes later either way.\n\n335\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.531\nAll right.\n\n336\n00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:40.630\nI think that's what it was 03026,\nnow how did I get this rule?\n\n337\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.270\nWhat happened is I saw\nthe Calle machine and\n\n338\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.550\nit generated a result on\na certain snort rule.\n\n339\n00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.240\nSo then I found out what that was,\nI got the actual rule and came in here and\n\n340\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.800\nnow I can type that in and\nchange it right?\n\n341\n00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.650\nI think that was right, MS03026.\n\n342\n00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.650\nAnd you've got 25,000 rules here\nwe've got to look through for this.\n\n343\n00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.132\nSo basically I came in here and\nsaid look This right here,\n\n344\n00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:08.142\nthis was a Microsoft vent right\ncame through and this is malware.\n\n345\n00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:12.120\nI had actually came here in, clicked this\nguy up here and changed these to drop and\n\n346\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.069\ngenerate events.\n\n347\n00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:16.873\nSo I actually went out and said,\nokay this was a Microsoft event,\n\n348\n00:16:16.873 --> 00:16:19.585\nthis was a true event\nbased on my fake network.\n\n349\n00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:24.012\n[LAUGH] This truly happened from Callie\nwent into this Microsoft exploit and\n\n350\n00:16:24.012 --> 00:16:24.720\nsent this.\n\n351\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.474\nAnd it was just kind of alerting, all\nthese weren't even enabled so I said no,\n\n352\n00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:28.579\nno, I need to get some events.\n\n353\n00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:31.668\nSo I went and typed these in and did this.\n\n354\n00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:32.732\nSo that's what I do with my IPS policy.\n\n355\n00:16:32.732 --> 00:16:35.739\nNotice I didnt' get a triangle here\nbecause I haven't changed anything.\n\n356\n00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:37.422\nOkay?\n\n357\n00:16:37.422 --> 00:16:40.579\nThen when I went to my access control\npolicy, let's go ahead and take a look at.\n\n358\n00:16:42.612 --> 00:16:43.413\nAnd pop three.\n\n359\n00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:46.150\nNotice everything is still up to date and\nthat's how we like it.\n\n360\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.400\nAnd in the meantime what\nI'm doing here guys is\n\n361\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.150\nI'm gathering fire site information,\nright?\n\n362\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.540\nWe just enabled our\nnetwork discovery policy.\n\n363\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.430\nI need to let it run.\n\n364\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.010\nYou really need to let it run for\na few days but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n365\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.570\ndo it anyways.\n\n366\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.790\nLook, now notice it here\nI'm logging our traffic,\n\n367\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.210\nI'm monitoring everything that comes in.\n\n368\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.280\nI'm going to see every single connection.\n\n369\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.130\nI'm blocking Germany with reset.\n\n370\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:13.427\nI didn't do a trust UDP DNS, and\nI typically in production would do that.\n\n371\n00:17:13.427 --> 00:17:17.663\nThen I allowed, I made a very\nsimple policy here that said,\n\n372\n00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:21.570\nokay, attach my IPS and\nfile policy and log it.\n\n373\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.672\nAnd then I did some undesirable webs and\n\n374\n00:17:23.672 --> 00:17:26.070\nnoticed [INAUDIBLE] I\ndoubt this is gonna work.\n\n375\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.970\nIt's probably gonna be blocked by the rule\nabove it but if it does get through there,\n\n376\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.990\nI'll take a look at it.\n\n377\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.930\nAnd then my last one is if you've come\nthis far, now you die a miserable death.\n\n378\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.920\nAll right.\n\n379\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.260\nSo basically that's where we're at.\n\n380\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.070\nOkay.\nSo let's ahead and\n\n381\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.680\nsee what we've learned so far.\n\n382\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.870\nSo analysis connection events.\n\n383\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.419\nLet's take a look.\n\n384\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.120\nAnd I sent some attacks, and\n\n385\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.700\nnow we can see these coming\nfrom this machine down here.\n\n386\n00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.100\nAnd it was responding out, and it got\nwhat's called an indication of compromise.\n\n387\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.980\nSo this machine, if you see something like\nthis, we have to take this very serious.\n\n388\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.020\nAnd this is the thing that\nwe see on contact explorer.\n\n389\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.420\nSo if I come over here and go to,\nI'm going to open this in new tab.\n\n390\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.220\nThink it went right here.\n\n391\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.420\nThe context of sport,\n\n392\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.990\nthe very first thing that shows up right\nhere is my indication compromise and\n\n393\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.390\nthese are the hosts that were compromised\nand when they are compromised.\n\n394\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.460\nOkay now this looks a lot better than say,\nwhere is that other screen at,\n\n395\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.814\nI am not there anymore.\n\n396\n00:18:20.814 --> 00:18:25.543\nAnyways, okay, this would be a typical\nthing I might see at a customer where you\n\n397\n00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:30.220\ndon't see thousands of attacks, we see\ndozens maybe or something like that.\n\n398\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.680\nAnd we see them when they come in and\nit's not just this constant straight line.\n\n399\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.583\nThat's again, if you see that,\nwe have to go unplug our Internet, right?\n\n400\n00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:40.436\nBut in this case here, we're saying hey,\nare these good or are these bad, right?\n\n401\n00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:41.598\nAre these good or these bad,\n\n402\n00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.128\nand this is what we're gonna do\nwhen we get to event analysis.\n\n403\n00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:46.043\nAll right so connection variances\nare very important to us.\n\n404\n00:18:46.043 --> 00:18:49.104\nBut now that we did our policy,\nand there's something else we did,\n\n405\n00:18:49.104 --> 00:18:52.490\nwe did network discovery,\nright we got that all set, we're good.\n\n406\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.620\nBut wait a minute, for my fire site to\nactually give me the information that\n\n407\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.820\nwe discussed, like who was this that did\nsomething we didn't want them to do,\n\n408\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.190\nlet's go over to users and configure that,\nand let me show you what I configured.\n\n409\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.150\nSo I preconfigured this, but basically\nthis is my ldap server that's running on\n\n410\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.990\nmy ad server so I came over here and\nsaid add ldap connection.\n\n411\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.530\nActually, let me cancel that.\n\n412\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:19.230\nI came over here and\nlet me just show you what I configured.\n\n413\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.370\nAnd we'll add a disk.\n\n414\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.980\nSo I put in my, with a name description,\nthe server type.\n\n415\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.030\nNow you can run radius, or a coal,\nor something like that, or other.\n\n416\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.050\nI highly recommend you run the AD and\n\n417\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.670\nI'll show you why in a second highly\nrecommend you run active directory.\n\n418\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.940\nOkay, we've got our ip address of the\nserver and it has a default port of 389.\n\n419\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.691\nAt that point you're gonna say\nfetch distinguish names, right?\n\n420\n00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:48.540\nIt's gonna give you that and then you're\ngonna add the actual distinguished name\n\n421\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.220\na name right here into the password.\n\n422\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.919\nNow add the encryption if you want it.\n\n423\n00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:57.279\nNow wait, once I do that, this is why you\ndid the AD, you can go back to the AD,\n\n424\n00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:01.200\nyou put that information in here,\nand then you save thatch grooves.\n\n425\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.830\nIt's going to go to the AD server and\nget the grooves.\n\n426\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.130\nOnce they're in here, now I clue them and\nsay groups to include.\n\n427\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.050\nWhy would I do this?\n\n428\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.860\nI mentioned this to you earlier.\n\n429\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.043\nI said, I'll show you why and\nhow we get these users in here, and\n\n430\n00:20:14.043 --> 00:20:17.919\nthat's just because if we go to\nthe access control policy so\n\n431\n00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.495\nif I go back over here, that was there.\n\n432\n00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:23.290\nLet me figure out where I'm at here,\nlet's just do it from here.\n\n433\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.475\nI'm here, policy's access control.\n\n434\n00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.540\nSo once I do that, I create that LDAP and\nI said, groups to include.\n\n435\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.620\nAnd I fetch the groups from the AV server,\nand I said to include, and then\n\n436\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.359\nI still have to save that configuration\nwhich I hadn't done at this point.\n\n437\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.390\nBut once I do that.\n\n438\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.205\nI'm showing you guys from here.\n\n439\n00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:45.208\n[NOISE] Got in the wrong thing.\n\n440\n00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:49.849\nWhen I do that and I create a rule and\nthen I go to users,\n\n441\n00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:52.544\nmy users will show up here now.\n\n442\n00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.760\nThose groups and users will show up here.\n\n443\n00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.950\nThat's why we did that.\n\n444\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.040\nOkay, that's why we created this.\n\n445\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.790\n>> Now when you configured it,\nit obviously reaches\n\n446\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.160\nout to the active directory and\npopulates that database the first time.\n\n447\n00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.650\nAnd then it's refreshing that, right?\n\n448\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.167\nSo as we add new users in the AD,\nis it going to update here?\n\n449\n00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:10.130\n>> No,\nactually I need to come back in here.\n\n450\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.060\nSo users, yes.\n\n451\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.683\nBut if I come back in here and\nI add a new group on my AD,\n\n452\n00:21:13.683 --> 00:21:16.567\nI'm gonna have to fetch groups and\nadd it back into here.\n\n453\n00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.844\n>> And that's a manual process?\n\n454\n00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:18.783\n>> It's a manual process.\n\n455\n00:21:18.783 --> 00:21:19.760\n>> But the users are automatic right?\n\n456\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.305\n>> Yeah.\n\n457\n00:21:20.305 --> 00:21:21.559\n>> And how often to refresh that?\n\n458\n00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:22.139\nDo you know?\n\n459\n00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:23.220\n>> No.\n\n460\n00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.425\n[LAUGH]\n>> Most people aren't adding users every\n\n461\n00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:27.895\nsingle day [CROSSTALK]\n>> But\n\n462\n00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:32.680\nin this case here I wanna come in here and\nadd these groups in here.\n\n463\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.120\nAnd I have to do that by hand.\n\n464\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.530\nNow, there's a really nice feature down\nhere, that instead of you doing this,\n\n465\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.950\nand it's not working, and your like, is\nthere something wrong with my AD Server?\n\n466\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.745\nIs there something wrong with my LDAP?\n\n467\n00:21:42.745 --> 00:21:44.370\nIs there something wrong\nwith my configuration?\n\n468\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.915\nWhere's the problem?\n\n469\n00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:49.239\nI can sit here and test it from here,\nand I can go ahead and\n\n470\n00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:54.080\nit will tell me, hey,\nthat works great, congratulations.\n\n471\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.360\nNow, if I was to come over here\nto Policies access control,\n\n472\n00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.140\nI got my AD in there, right?\n\n473\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:08.180\nMy LDAP server on my AD server, and\nif I come in here to my pod three here,\n\n474\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.729\nnow I will see under rules,\ncan't be in a hurry, can't be in a hurry.\n\n475\n00:22:14.729 --> 00:22:16.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just want this to go like this.\n\n476\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.560\nBut doesn't work that way.\n\n477\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.570\nNow when I come under rules,\n\n478\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.040\nI can sit there and\nsay you know what, sales upset me.\n\n479\n00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.580\nSo I'm going to block and\nnot allow him to go.\n\n480\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.562\nAnd I'm going to say users and\nthere they are, right?\n\n481\n00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:37.603\nAnd here they are, so\nhere's all my users and groups.\n\n482\n00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:40.715\nAnd I should have a sales in here,\nI thought I created one.\n\n483\n00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.608\nI like to pick on sales teams.\n\n484\n00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:46.462\nYeah, I guess I don't, I thought I did.\n\n485\n00:22:46.462 --> 00:22:51.800\nOkay, I'll say, who else should I pick on?\n\n486\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.670\nHow about Enterprise admins?\n\n487\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.940\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH] There's danger right there.\n\n488\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.900\n>> Guest, if they're a guest,\nwhy are they doing this?\n\n489\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.040\nSo we're gonna, these guys upset me.\n\n490\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.230\nGuests upset me.\n\n491\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.250\nThey shouldn't be here.\n\n492\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:10.520\nAnd I'm gonna say, in guests that are\ntrying to go to Facebook, I don't know.\n\n493\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.440\nAnd we're gonna say,\nall apps match in that filter.\n\n494\n00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.943\nAnd then of course we're gonna log it.\n\n495\n00:23:14.943 --> 00:23:18.259\nSo this is how you can use,\nI've got a sales user in there,\n\n496\n00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:20.380\nit's too fun to pick on a sales team.\n\n497\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.780\nI gotta be honest with you I do that,\nbeen doing that my whole career.\n\n498\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.682\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sales they're here all the,\n\n499\n00:23:24.682 --> 00:23:26.632\nthey come and go so\nfast let's pick on them.\n\n500\n00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:29.967\nBut now notice I've got user groups in\nhere now and I can users and so on.\n\n501\n00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:35.240\nAnd that allowed me to do it this users\npolicy allowed me to get that information,\n\n502\n00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.670\nso if I have AD and I'm using the LDAP\nnow I can get this information.\n\n503\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.608\nBut wait there's more, so I'm gonna come\ndown here, I'm gonna leave this page and\n\n504\n00:23:43.608 --> 00:23:46.460\nnot save this, so\nthat's my LDAP connection and\n\n505\n00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.329\nmy default is turned off like this,\nwatch this.\n\n506\n00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.909\nSo when I created this I said that it's\nlike this, this line bar's not here.\n\n507\n00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:56.199\nSo I'm gonna click this to enable it.\n\n508\n00:23:56.199 --> 00:23:57.899\nOkay, what's the other thing I'm gonna do?\n\n509\n00:23:57.899 --> 00:23:59.687\nWell, that's what our\nnext section is where we\n\n510\n00:23:59.687 --> 00:24:01.170\nhit external authentication, okay?\n\n511\n00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.606\nAnd so we're going to have to configure\nour [INAUDIBLE] out there again.\n\n512\n00:24:05.606 --> 00:24:07.151\nBut, none the less, keep this in mind.\n\n513\n00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:09.861\nWe're going to come back to this and\nthis is very important.\n\n514\n00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:13.550\nNow, user agents here, there's something\ncalled a Source Fire User Agent, and what\n\n515\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.700\nthat does, it goes out and watches on your\nAD, all these users that logging on and\n\n516\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.790\nlogging off, and getting their\ninformation, so we can find out who it is.\n\n517\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.890\nSo, we are gonna say, add user agent, and\nI'm gonna put in the name of the user\n\n518\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:30.180\nagent, which in this case was 10,\n11, actually, it's already in here.\n\n519\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:36.280\nAnd the name of it, sorry,\nUser Agent, and I run this on my AD.\n\n520\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.240\nNow, it doesn't have to be run\non the server that has the AD,\n\n521\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.380\nit can be run on any Windows box actually.\n\n522\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.980\nThe problem is,\nyou need administrator rights to that AD.\n\n523\n00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.220\nSo really, you're gonna go to\nthe server that's running the AD and\n\n524\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.610\nyou're going to talk to the administrator,\nand says hey, I need this on here, and\n\n525\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.140\nit has to be run as an administrator and\nall that, and they're like, no.\n\n526\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.940\nAnd you're like, okay, I'll just go\nput it on this Windows XP or whatever,\n\n527\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.410\ndoesn't even matter, and\nI'm going to run it from there and\n\n528\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.440\nit talk to the AD with\nadministrative rights.\n\n529\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.870\nSo good luck with this one.\n\n530\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.750\nOkay, so this is kind of a point\nof contention as well, trying to\n\n531\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.440\nget the server team to allow you to put\nsomething on your server so you can get\n\n532\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.760\ninformation into your fire site database,\nand that's really what we're doing here.\n\n533\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.940\nNow, let's say the server team\nis okay with that, you know,\n\n534\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.540\nshocking, but we're allowed to\ninstall this software on dc and\n\n535\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.130\nwe probably have more than one\ndomain controller for redundancy.\n\n536\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.560\nIs there benefit of having\nmore than one agent.\n\n537\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.450\n>> You actually wanna\nput this on every server\n\n538\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.670\n>> On every one, okay.\n\n539\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.380\n>> That has ad, yeah,\n\n540\n00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.440\nbecause first off, I can only have\nfive firesite management centers.\n\n541\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.930\nAnd so, if I have a bunch of\nfireside management centers,\n\n542\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.820\nI can only have five and\nthe software running on one server.\n\n543\n00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.960\nSo, I pretty much put\nthe software on every server so\n\n544\n00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.490\nwe have a thousand servers.\n\n545\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.170\nI kind of want to run\nthis a thousand times,\n\n546\n00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.230\nso I can get as much\nfireside data as possible.\n\n547\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.610\nAgain, now you can see why my\nfireside data base is getting big.\n\n548\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.220\n>> Right\n>> Then,\n\n549\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.280\nnonetheless, you guys want to do this.\n\n550\n00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.410\nAnd you download this through your through\nyour login once you get your software,\n\n551\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.470\nsource fire user agents.\n\n552\n00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.110\nIt's a simple piece of software,\nyou click it, very small configuration.\n\n553\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.760\nAnd then you go to each defense.\n\n554\n00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.950\nNow, I'm doing this on the defense,\nI don't have to manage devices.\n\n555\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.890\nThis is a different center configuration,\nright?\n\n556\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.340\nAnd then once I apply this,\nwe're all good to go.\n\n557\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.600\nWe're gathering information.\n\n558\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.240\nSo let's go ahead\n>> Just got a few more minutes, and we're\n\n559\n00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.770\ngonna show you now I was at policies,\nwe did network discovery and we did users.\n\n560\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.410\nThe next thing we want to\ndo is analysis of this.\n\n561\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.540\nSo next, I have hosts, end users, right?\n\n562\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.180\nSo I can see users activity in the users,\nand this is what I'm gathering here.\n\n563\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.640\nSo when I came here for\npolicies and network discovery,\n\n564\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.470\nnow work discover in users were based\non my network discovery policy, right?\n\n565\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.690\nI don't have to do users, but\nI highly recommend doing them,\n\n566\n00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.540\nit's very helpful to get those groups\nin that access control policy, right?\n\n567\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.950\nNow, under analysis,\nwe have our intrusions for IPS events.\n\n568\n00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.910\nConnections that come from our access and\nso on, context explorer but.\n\n569\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.910\nThen we have files, look in those\nwe have malware events here, so\n\n570\n00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.160\ndid we get the e-malware we've applied\nthis let's go ahead and take a quick,\n\n571\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.810\nwe'll come back to this [LAUGH] But\nI'm kinda excited about this, aren't you?\n\n572\n00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.540\nTo see if we got any malware events.\n\n573\n00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.230\nNow, again you can't be\nin any hurry because\n\n574\n00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.830\nit's thinking it's thinking it's thinking.\n\n575\n00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.720\nIt's like whoa check this out.\n\n576\n00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.110\nLook at this, this is awesome.\n\n577\n00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.160\nI got some malware, baby.\n\n578\n00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.030\nSo it's really easy actually, in\na production network to put this out and\n\n579\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.650\nsee the malware if you cut your\nfile policy and put it on there,\n\n580\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.850\nyou will find malware.\n\n581\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:23.770\nGuaranteed.\n\n582\n00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.570\nAnyways, we will come back to that.\n\n583\n00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.480\nI just get really excited about\nshowing you guys something exciting.\n\n584\n00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.230\nAnd we're gonna find out what happens when\nyou click on this little red icon here.\n\n585\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.370\nAll right.\nBut, nonetheless,\n\n586\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.090\nlet's get our Fireside Data.\n\n587\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.790\nWhat did we get?\nLet's find\n\n588\n00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.210\nout what Fireside found about us so far.\n\n589\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.410\nDoes that sound good?\n\n590\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.640\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n591\n00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.300\n>> Okay.\nNetwork maps.\n\n592\n00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.310\nI'm gonna click on my network map and\n\n593\n00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.570\nyou've got to remember that I\nhave a pretty small network.\n\n594\n00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.660\nI have a whole single one host.\n\n595\n00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.550\nAnd I have the server, I have the host,\nI have my outside attack machine and\n\n596\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.710\nnow I have my management network and\n\n597\n00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.235\nI can't get it any smaller than this\nreally and make it work or I would have.\n\n598\n00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:57.670\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe're gonna see what did fireside found,\n\n599\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.290\nwe'll look what it found,\nhere's my ten network.\n\n600\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.240\nRemember I said only find the RC1918,\nso I have my ten network and\n\n601\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.530\nI'm gonna come down here and\nit's gonna show me the host.\n\n602\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.300\nNow I can click on these hosts from here.\n\n603\n00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.110\nAnd this guy is actually\nin my outside network.\n\n604\n00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.340\nThis is my inside network.\n\n605\n00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.480\nI just happen to know that.\n\n606\n00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.210\nBut I'm gonna see,\nwell what's going on with this guy?\n\n607\n00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.090\nIs he good?\nYou know, ten, eleven, eleven, eleven.\n\n608\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.320\nI actually do have two inside\nhosts there obviously.\n\n609\n00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.890\nForgot about my second one there.\n\n610\n00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.270\n>> Well that's why we do discovery.\n\n611\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.330\n>> Thank you, Fireside.\n\n612\n00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.210\nOh my gosh,\nit's an urgent emergency problem.\n\n613\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.980\nWe need to get someone\non the phone right away.\n\n614\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.950\nWhere's the bat phone?\n\n615\n00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.700\nBecause I have an indication\nof compromise on this host.\n\n616\n00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.670\nThis host has encountered malware,\nand it's likely vulnerable.\n\n617\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.020\nWe got a serious problem here.\n\n618\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.280\nI'm gonna send someone out to fix it,\nand I'm gonna mark it as resolved,\n\n619\n00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.420\nbecause the fact is, our idea is here, we\nsee a problem, we need to fix the problem.\n\n620\n00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.990\nWe're just gonna go wow.\n\n621\n00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.570\nWe got malware.\n\n622\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.498\nThat kinda sucks, dude.\n\n623\n00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:49.530\nRight?\n>> Whoops.\n\n624\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.580\n>> [LAUGH] Or\nBob in Sales he's kinda really,\n\n625\n00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.360\nhe's got some ran some where he better\nget out his credit card, you know.\n\n626\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.800\nSay we gotta talk about that later,\n\n627\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.020\nwhat does th FBI say when\nyou get ran somewhere.\n\n628\n00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.440\nAll right this is his\noperating systems and\n\n629\n00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.340\nthis is what fire site found\nis the operating system.\n\n630\n00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.340\nIt says Well, we know it's this\nMicrosoft something in here,\n\n631\n00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.060\nbut we can edit this and say no.\n\n632\n00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.960\nI know what this one is.\n\n633\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.520\nIt's a 20003 Firesite,\njust needs more information.\n\n634\n00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.990\nRemember, we've only been sitting for\na couple of minutes.\n\n635\n00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.460\nFiresite needs more time.\n\n636\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.710\nI would give it days\nbefore you go in here.\n\n637\n00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.130\nOkay?\nAnd then servers.\n\n638\n00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.410\nThis is telling me\nThere's two web services.\n\n639\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.040\nRight?\n\n640\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.780\nApplications, users and\nprotocols, and so on, and so\n\n641\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.070\nwe can get all this\ninformation about this.\n\n642\n00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.890\nObviously, as you can see that I'm setting\nup a Take malware file through here.\n\n643\n00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.850\nIt's even telling us that hey,\nthis is really not a virus,\n\n644\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.090\nbut don't tell anybody.\n\n645\n00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.490\nSo anyways, it's fun to be\nable to do that safecar.com.\n\n646\n00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.320\nAnyways, this is gonna tell me now\nI don't see the net biosane or\n\n647\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.700\nI don't see the The current user, because\nI didn't log into AD, but typically in\n\n648\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.080\nmost of my customers I see they're\nnow a lot of people still use that.\n\n649\n00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.800\nAnd we still see a current user if they\nlog into the server, we'll get that,\n\n650\n00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.410\nfireside will give us that,\n\n651\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.505\nright now I kind of don't have\n>> Sensor?\n\n652\n00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:09.005\nIt's a mystery for now, but\nFireSide will find out.\n\n653\n00:30:09.005 --> 00:30:11.475\nAll right, so wiz is pretty quick,\nso we go in there and see that.\n\n654\n00:30:11.475 --> 00:30:13.485\nLet's take a look at just\na couple more things.\n\n655\n00:30:13.485 --> 00:30:16.375\nI can go out there and\nhost indications of compromise.\n\n656\n00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:19.025\nDiscovery events will just tell me\neverything that FireSide finds.\n\n657\n00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:21.095\nSo we're not gonna see\nmuch in there right now,\n\n658\n00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:24.035\nbut on your network this is gonna be full,\nand full, and\n\n659\n00:30:24.035 --> 00:30:27.215\nfull as it's discovering every\ntime someone makes a connection.\n\n660\n00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:30.585\nHosted servers, but let's take a look\nat some hosts and see what we found.\n\n661\n00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.370\nOkay and this is telling me operating\nsystems what they are, Microsoft, Google,\n\n662\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.110\nCento S, ubuntu, is that true?\n\n663\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.030\nAbsolutely not fire site is\na little confused right now it's\n\n664\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.200\nonly been running for\na very short period of time.\n\n665\n00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.290\nThe fact is I don't have\nall this out there.\n\n666\n00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.290\nubuntu I do, Microsoft I do.\n\n667\n00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:50.360\nI don't have an android device,\nand I don't have a Lennox,\n\n668\n00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.920\nI do have a Lennox and I do have Centro S.\n\n669\n00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.480\nSo the only one it's confused on\nit says I think it's Android, but\n\n670\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.700\nwe're gonna keep getting some getting\nsome til we determine what that is.\n\n671\n00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.870\nSo when you see firesite,\nit does correct itself.\n\n672\n00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.200\nIt does take quality firesite data.\n\n673\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.790\nLet me show you one more thing\nthat why we do what we just did.\n\n674\n00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.920\nIn other words, why did we create\nthis network discovery policy?\n\n675\n00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.710\nThat's great.\nBut why did we create the users and\n\n676\n00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.130\nall that other stuff?\n\n677\n00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:18.100\nIt's really so we can have Fire Site\ngo out and make recommendations for\n\n678\n00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.030\nus, run on my network for a week, and\nthen come back and tell me what to do.\n\n679\n00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.700\nSo let's go take a quick more look,\njust a couple more minutes, my friend.\n\n680\n00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.750\n>> Sure.\n>> And I'm gonna come in here to policies,\n\n681\n00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.690\nIntrusion > Policy.\n\n682\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.930\nSo now we're gonna go\nback into IPS policy.\n\n683\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.740\nI typically show this before but I didn't\nhave my network discovery configured.\n\n684\n00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.660\nSo I want to come back into\nmy IPS policy right here\n\n685\n00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.020\nSee this little asterisk right here\nthat says, hey we made some changes, but\n\n686\n00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.990\nwe didn't save them the last\ntime we were there.\n\n687\n00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:46.150\nThat's what that asterisk says.\n\n688\n00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.120\nOkay.\nSo, we're gonna come back here and\n\n689\n00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.690\nwe're taking a look at this And\nnotice I look at my policy layers.\n\n690\n00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.205\nNow I see FireSIGHT recommendations down\nhere because I had already played with\n\n691\n00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:58.420\nthis pod and\ngot it working before we came in here.\n\n692\n00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.940\nBut in the muddle of times you just see\nthe base layer and then my changes, and\n\n693\n00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.750\nthen I come up here and\nclick on FireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n694\n00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.270\n>> I'm basically creating another layer.\n\n695\n00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.489\nSo, when I look at this though,\nonce I do those recommendations,\n\n696\n00:32:09.489 --> 00:32:12.477\nit actually shows it as a base layer,\nas the built-in layer,\n\n697\n00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:15.370\nlike kind of combined with\nthe base layer or right above it.\n\n698\n00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.480\nBut it's below my changes layer, isn't it?\n\n699\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.450\nMy changes layer's gonna take precedence\nover any of the lower layers.\n\n700\n00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.085\nRemember, I can create\nmultiple layers there.\n\n701\n00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:25.770\nAnd when I do then I can move these\naround and put one on top of the other,\n\n702\n00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.610\nmake one more important than the other.\n\n703\n00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.610\nAnd the reason I would do that is\nif I had multiple IPS policies and\n\n704\n00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.740\nI want to create a really complex one and\nshare that across my other IPS policies.\n\n705\n00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.410\nAll right.\n\n706\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.060\nSo in here and let's go back\nto Fire Site recommendations.\n\n707\n00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.790\nIt says, hey, at this point here\nit's gonna say use recommendations,\n\n708\n00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.450\nno recommendations have been used,\nbut I already used them.\n\n709\n00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.710\nSo, every once in a while,\nlike once a week we'll go ahead and\n\n710\n00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.990\nschedule this later today\nonce you get to scheduling.\n\n711\n00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.010\nI'm gonna say schedule fire site\nrecommendations to go out once a week.\n\n712\n00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.560\nTell me what you think, recommendations,\nand update my IPS policy, and\n\n713\n00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.220\nupdate my access control policy.\n\n714\n00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.810\nWow.\nSo I usually do that and schedule that for\n\n715\n00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.580\nmy customers Friday night at midnight or\nsomething like that.\n\n716\n00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.710\nAgain, I don't do this on a Sunday\nnight or a Monday morning or\n\n717\n00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.060\nsomething like that,\nbecause what happens if a problem occurs?\n\n718\n00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.900\nNow you have the weekend to fix it.\n\n719\n00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900\nNot that you wanna work on the weekend,\nbut\n\n720\n00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.430\nin this case here you don't wanna\ncome into Monday with any surprises.\n\n721\n00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.760\nSo this way you can get up\nSaturday morning, kinda log in and\n\n722\n00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.680\nburp your Unix machine here, right?\n\n723\n00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.560\nSo.\n\n724\n00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.300\n>> Yeah.\nNow if we're in a mission critical\n\n725\n00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.950\nenvironment where there is no acceptable\ndowntime, we would really need to get\n\n726\n00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.400\na completely separate device for\na test environment first, right?\n\n727\n00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.140\n>> You could do that.\n\n728\n00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.760\nI don't know how much I\nhave to worry about that.\n\n729\n00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.683\nBut what I would do is go into my access\ncontrol policy in an advanced tab and\n\n730\n00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:40.425\nsay go ahead and\nsend traffic while I'm updating.\n\n731\n00:33:40.425 --> 00:33:41.965\nAnd then it doesn't matter\nwhen this is updating, but\n\n732\n00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:43.980\nit's coming through uninspected.\n\n733\n00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.011\nSo, you kinda got a conundrum here,\nbecause you're sitting there saying,\n\n734\n00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:49.434\nlook, I have a traffic,\nit can't come through unexpected,\n\n735\n00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:52.535\nbut I can't have any downtime, not even\nfor a minute or two, or five minutes.\n\n736\n00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:54.067\nNo, it can never happen.\n\n737\n00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:55.229\nWell, what are you gonna do?\n\n738\n00:33:55.229 --> 00:33:58.925\nYou either have to send it through\nuninspected or well, yeah,\n\n739\n00:33:58.925 --> 00:34:01.643\njust add another PO to your,\nzero to your PO and\n\n740\n00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:06.120\nget a stronger box so\nyour access control policy updates faster.\n\n741\n00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.820\nThose are your options, right?\n\n742\n00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.860\nYou're options are let it\ngo through uninspected or\n\n743\n00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.490\nblock it while I'm updating,\nor buy a faster box.\n\n744\n00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.740\n>> It comes down to priorities for\nthe organization.\n\n745\n00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.600\n>> It really does.\n\n746\n00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.390\nNotice this is taking a while because it's\ngoing out there and looking for FireSite.\n\n747\n00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:26.320\nSo, we'll go ahead and let this run for\na while and then I just got an,\n\n748\n00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.530\nI'm done with it, it's gonna\ntell me the changes that I make,\n\n749\n00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.520\nit'll say, hey, do you like these changes?\n\n750\n00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.980\nGo ahead, and let's go ahead apply it.\n\n751\n00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.030\nAnd then once that's done\nwhat do I have to do?\n\n752\n00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.640\nI have to go to my access\ncontrol policy and reapply that.\n\n753\n00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.510\n>> All right.\n\n754\n00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.700\nSo, do we want to do a little magic\nof television here and wait for\n\n755\n00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.570\nthat to finish, or do we want to just pick\nback up with that in the next episode?\n\n756\n00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.101\nWhat do you think [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n757\n00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:47.472\nWe can pick it up in the next episode.\n\n758\n00:34:47.472 --> 00:34:48.500\nThat's fine.\n\n759\n00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.770\n>> Okay.\nWell, then that works out for us.\n\n760\n00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.530\nWe'll go ahead and\nwrap this episode up here.\n\n761\n00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.570\nNow stay tuned because we do\nstill have to apply that, so\n\n762\n00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.390\nwe'll get a chance to see it.\n\n763\n00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:58.280\nBut then we're gonna move on to some of\nthe other features inside of FirePower\n\n764\n00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.290\nthat we need to work with to really get\nour money's worth out of this thing.\n\n765\n00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.480\n>> Yes.\n>> So, definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n766\n00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.590\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap it up here.\n\n767\n00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.015\nHope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n768\n00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:09.685\nSigning off for IT Pro TV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n769\n00:35:09.685 --> 00:35:10.520\n>> Todd Lanley.\n\n770\n00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.309\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n771\n00:35:12.309 --> 00:35:17.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.712\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.530\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.460\nBack again with another\nepisode of Cisco Fire Power,\n\n6\n00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400\nI almost said Source Fire there Todd.\n\n7\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.745\n[LAUGH]\n>> Make you take a drink now.\n\n8\n00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.247\n>> [LAUGH] Well we are back in\nthe saddle again jumping into,\n\n9\n00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:33.655\nwell we saw network discovery policies\nin the last episode and we were kind of\n\n10\n00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.921\nrunning through a few things and\nthere was a little bit we didn't get to.\n\n11\n00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.909\nSo we wanted to do a follow-up episode to\ncatch some of that stuff before we moved\n\n12\n00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:41.080\non to some of our other topics.\n\n13\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.630\nSo, we're back in the world\nof network discovery,\n\n14\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.580\nback in the world of a little\nbit of analyses that we'll see.\n\n15\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.129\nAnd enough of me rambling on.\n\n16\n00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.540\nTodd, let's turn the floor over to you,\nand get a chance to see this stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.087\n>> Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:57.360\nOkay, so in the last one here, we were\nconfiguring our network discovered policy.\n\n19\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.270\nAgain just to summarize\nwe did our file policy.\n\n20\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.296\nWe did our IPS policy to\nour access control policy.\n\n21\n00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:06.684\nWe did it in that order for a reason, but\nagain it's not mandatory to do that but\n\n22\n00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.629\nwe did and it worked out very well.\n\n23\n00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:11.532\nThen we came back and\nwe did our network discovery policy and\n\n24\n00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:14.890\nthat has to be done in a certain,\nyou saw that we got errors.\n\n25\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.914\nThat it was trying to apply itself before\nwe had our Access Control Policy before\n\n26\n00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:19.462\nand it was giving us wrong STAR Version.\n\n27\n00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:23.028\nNow that we have that, I also went out and\nconfigured our LDAP connection\n\n28\n00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:26.418\nover to our AD server which was\nrunning our source for our user agent,\n\n29\n00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:30.042\nshowed you how to do that and basically\nnow we were able to add our groups and\n\n30\n00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:32.470\nwe can see that now on our\nAccess Control Policy.\n\n31\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.330\nThat one being said Now that\nwe went out and took a break,\n\n32\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.450\nhad something to eat,\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n33\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.950\nlet's take a look at some FireSIGHT\ndata and see what happened.\n\n34\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.870\nBecause remember, right before we left,\nwe went out to our IPS policy and\n\n35\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.920\nsaid hey FireSIGHT, what's going on?\n\n36\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.070\nWhat do you think we should do?\n\n37\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.580\nAnd we set FireSIGHT recommendations,\nsaid okay, and then we took off.\n\n38\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.129\nAnd it came back and said, yeah, okay.\n\n39\n00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:53.420\nI found some recommendations, let's do it.\n\n40\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.050\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n41\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.110\nSo I'm gonna come back over here.\n\n42\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.400\nWe did take a quick look at it earlier.\n\n43\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.850\nBut we're gonna get a little\nbit more in depth, right now.\n\n44\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.120\nAnd this will be a very short section,\nguys.\n\n45\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.400\nBut I wanted to gather some information.\n\n46\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.000\nSo first off, let's go ahead and\nsay analysis, remember?\n\n47\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.762\nSo remember, analysis intrusions.\n\n48\n00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:11.510\nThis is my IPS.\n\n49\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.160\nHere's my file policy information.\n\n50\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.480\nYou know, malware, captured files.\n\n51\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.108\nAnd we'll go through this in a minute.\n\n52\n00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:18.890\nBut, connection event.\n\n53\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.380\nSo, this is all the stuff that we've\ngotten from our current policies and for\n\n54\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.420\nour network analysis, I'm sorry,\nfor our network discovery,\n\n55\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.630\nwe have hosts and users.\n\n56\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.546\nThese tabs here.\n\n57\n00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:30.070\nWe'll use this to look at that data.\n\n58\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.394\nSo, let's take a quick look at users here.\n\n59\n00:02:33.394 --> 00:02:36.480\nAnd we'll see what FireSIGHT found here.\n\n60\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.990\nWe can see that there's probably\ngonna be quite a bit here.\n\n61\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.070\nWe can see, and here's the deal is,\nwe can see that, of course,\n\n62\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.046\nthis being a test environment,\nwe have a lot of problems here.\n\n63\n00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:47.398\nThe blue mean FireSIGHT found but\nthey don't have a problem.\n\n64\n00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:52.690\nRed mean an indication of compromise,\nis something we wanna look at right away.\n\n65\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.360\nAgain, if we start seeing things like pop,\npop, pop, pop, pop,\n\n66\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.050\nall these indicate these IOCs\nhappen with these different hosts,\n\n67\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.350\nyou might have a Zero Day Attack, and\nwe can easily stop that by adding\n\n68\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.320\nthat source that it's coming from to our\nblacklist and immediately it's done.\n\n69\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.070\nOkay.\nIn this case here, that's our users and\n\n70\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.080\nwe can go through here.\n\n71\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.503\nAnd we can add four hundred\nsixty seven pages to that.\n\n72\n00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:14.838\nAnd, our network map here you can see I'm\nlooking at a bigger network here now.\n\n73\n00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:19.150\nOn this network map here, I can see\nthat I don't care about this mac adders.\n\n74\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.310\nI don't care about it here.\n\n75\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.458\nThese are all my rc1918, right?\n\n76\n00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:24.260\nSo here's my ten networks.\n\n77\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.280\nThere's 685 hosts in here,\ndifferent subnets, the 172.68 and\n\n78\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.720\non my 192 let's go ahead and take a look\nhere, there's only 9 different ones here.\n\n79\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.435\nAnd we can see it here one, four,\nthere's three under this sub net here.\n\n80\n00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:43.715\nLet's see if any of them have\na indication of compromise.\n\n81\n00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:47.365\nWe'll just pick one randomly,\nI've got nothing against this host.\n\n82\n00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.055\n>> Now Todd when you do this out in the\nfield, let's say you go to a client, and\n\n83\n00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:53.020\nthey've got, I'll just make up\na number here, 1,000 clients.\n\n84\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.620\nRight?\n\n85\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.490\nAnd you fire up network discovery,\nand you turn it loose on the network,\n\n86\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.810\nhow long do you normally wait, how much\ntime do you normally give it before\n\n87\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.820\nyou jump back in there and\nstart working on it?\n\n88\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.970\n>> It doesn't really take that, because\nhosts are always transmitting data, right?\n\n89\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.684\nEspecially if you have Windows, right?\n\n90\n00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:09.260\n[LAUGH] It's always this\njabbering out there.\n\n91\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.618\nSo you need information, what we really\nwant to get is user information,\n\n92\n00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.338\napplication information,\nprotocol information.\n\n93\n00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:16.754\nSo honestly I would probably\ntake a couple of days.\n\n94\n00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:19.778\n>> Okay, so just let it run,\nlet it collect the data, because if we\n\n95\n00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:23.260\ndive in too early, we run the risk of\nit having misidentified something.\n\n96\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.510\n>> And that was the hole thing.\n\n97\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.370\nEven if we look at here, this is saying,\nhey, the operating system on this\n\n98\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.500\nhost I'm looking at, it's either Linux,\nApple, Red Hat, or CentOS.\n\n99\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.990\nWe know it's one of those,\nbut in FireSIGHT it's like,\n\n100\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.370\nI'm narrowing it down to these four.\n\n101\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.910\n>> Right.\n\n102\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.790\n>> Right.\nAnd so it'll eventually tell it again.\n\n103\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.463\nI can go over In there and\nedit it, and tell it,\n\n104\n00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:44.046\nhey FireSIGHT we know this is a CentOS or\nwhatever it is right?\n\n105\n00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:47.931\nI'm not seeing my users and that Biosaves\nin this case here, FireSIGHT, because\n\n106\n00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:51.895\nI might see the host and the protocols but\nthe user hasn't logged in and logged out.\n\n107\n00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:55.877\nSo then as soon as they do that my source\nfire user agent on the server will give\n\n108\n00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:58.135\nme, hey, this is what happened.\n\n109\n00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:01.725\nNow so we can see our protocols here and\ncheckpoint HTTPS.\n\n110\n00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:03.410\nNow why is this important\nthat we see this?\n\n111\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.170\nBecause basically what's going to happen\nis tomorrow when we come back, and\n\n112\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.740\nwe're going to create some different white\nlists and traffic profiles, and say,\n\n113\n00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.810\nyou know on the sales land,\nwe don't allow this, but we allow that.\n\n114\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.850\nWe allow this application,\nbut not that one.\n\n115\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.920\nWe allow Mac's, but we don't allow PC's.\n\n116\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.990\nAnd we can be that and so, we can come\nin here and see what's going on, and\n\n117\n00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.590\nthen build our white list accordingly,\nand our traffic profiles accordingly.\n\n118\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.970\nSo we can see down here that there's\nalready one white list built, and\n\n119\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.440\nthese guys are saying,\n\n120\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.660\nhey, this guy's using checkpoint and\nI told them they couldn't use checkpoint.\n\n121\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.010\nSo I'm getting violations\nfrom these guys right here.\n\n122\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.872\nNow, we can do something about it,\nwe can remediate [LAUGH] this issue, but\n\n123\n00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.560\nI'm not going to right now.\n\n124\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.537\nAnd now these vulnerabilities down here,\nit says, hey,\n\n125\n00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:47.962\non this host there's 492 modem billers,\nwhich is maybe true.\n\n126\n00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:51.980\nBut remember at this point\nFireSIGHT is a passive technology.\n\n127\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.330\nSo it says here it came out here and\nit found,\n\n128\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.250\nbased on its operating systems\nthat it thinks it's one of these.\n\n129\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.892\nIt does not show that when\nit determines that is says,\n\n130\n00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:03.768\nbased on the operating system and the\ncode, it's going to have possibly these\n\n131\n00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:06.129\nvulnerabilities that you\nneed to look out for.\n\n132\n00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.629\nWe have you passive, how do I know?\n\n133\n00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:08.921\nI'm passive.\n\n134\n00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:10.379\nI'm not active.\n\n135\n00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.879\nOkay, so that's that.\n\n136\n00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:18.004\nSo, so let's go down to host\nindications of compromise.\n\n137\n00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:20.804\nAnd this is gonna tell us how\nmany indications of compromise\n\n138\n00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:22.712\nof different malwares and stuff we had.\n\n139\n00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:26.462\nSo in this case we had malware detected,\nwe have 438.\n\n140\n00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:28.462\nThat might be a little high for\nsome networks.\n\n141\n00:06:28.462 --> 00:06:29.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But this number,\n\n142\n00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:34.300\nif you configure a file policy correctly,\nthis number will never probably be zero.\n\n143\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.440\nSo we need to go out and\njust track these down.\n\n144\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.372\nSo if we do this we can stop malware but\n\n145\n00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:44.586\nwhen we're first starting this\nup we probably will see malware.\n\n146\n00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:47.794\nThese impact two and impact one attacks,\nthis is something that we should take\n\n147\n00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:50.087\na look at and say,\nwhat's an impact two and impact one.\n\n148\n00:06:50.087 --> 00:06:52.962\nAnd I'm gonna come back to\nthis with network analysis.\n\n149\n00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:55.755\nBut I can look at these and I can drill\ndown, so if I clicked on this and\n\n150\n00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:57.580\nI said impact 1 and impact 1's the worst.\n\n151\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.970\nI think that's bad I need to get on this\nright away, so notice I check marked this,\n\n152\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.680\nnow I can hit this blue arrow next\nto it and kinda drill down to it.\n\n153\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.329\nBut I'm gonna come over here and just go\nto hosts and say just take me to the end,\n\n154\n00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:10.462\nshow me the hosts.\n\n155\n00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:13.837\nWe have a lot by the way,\n247 hosts, right?\n\n156\n00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:16.588\nSo this is the first one, activityfar.1.\n\n157\n00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:19.171\nThis guy has a serious problem.\n\n158\n00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:19.921\nRight?\n\n159\n00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:24.004\nWe're seeing a lot of\nindications of compromise.\n\n160\n00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:27.755\nSo [COUGH] again, I'm not seeing the user.\n\n161\n00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:28.712\nI see what the problem is.\n\n162\n00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:30.796\nThey're using Check Point\ninstead of Cisco.\n\n163\n00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:31.879\nSo, there's the problem right there.\n\n164\n00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.212\nSo, Cisco is seeing this as a violation.\n\n165\n00:07:34.212 --> 00:07:36.110\n>> That'll send up a flag.\n\n166\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.653\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,\n\n167\n00:07:36.653 --> 00:07:38.480\nsaying, you got Check Point on there.\n\n168\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.362\nAlert, alert.\nLevel 1.\n\n169\n00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:40.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Obviously, you've made a mistake.\n\n170\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.290\nYou spent money with the wrong company.\n\n171\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.200\nWe just wanna help you.\n\n172\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.397\n>> Yeah, we're trying to help you out\nfrom your really bad mistake here.\n\n173\n00:07:47.397 --> 00:07:51.480\nAnd so, we're gonna take a look here and\nsee the operating systems,\n\n174\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.240\nand since it is Check Point,\n\n175\n00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.970\nit probably is running these multiple\nLinux and CentOS and stuff like that.\n\n176\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.630\nThat's a very good possibility.\n\n177\n00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.380\nWe can see the protocols\nthat it was using.\n\n178\n00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.570\nSo [LAUGH] indications\nof compromise are good.\n\n179\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.630\nI can do applications, discovery events.\n\n180\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.530\nThis is going to tell me\nall what FireSIGHT found as\n\n181\n00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.520\nwe're discovering as there's\nconnections and so on.\n\n182\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.171\nSo we can see all of this and\nthese aren't bad.\n\n183\n00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:19.570\nThere's nothing necessarily bad here,\nthese are just all our discovery events.\n\n184\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.510\nAnd we can find out,\nhere's the problem over here.\n\n185\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:28.290\nThat and on this lab here we run a really\nlow version of Firefox for a reason.\n\n186\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.250\nSo, we get a lot of vulnerabilities,\nand so we see a lot of attacks happen.\n\n187\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.959\nBecause the Steven lobby knows\nwho go this from LDAP, right, and\n\n188\n00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:40.411\nwe can click this information find out if\nin our LDAP we have his phone number and\n\n189\n00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:42.045\ndepartment, and all that.\n\n190\n00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:43.520\nThen this will show up in here right.\n\n191\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.470\nAnd, so basically what we\nare saying here is the connection,\n\n192\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.962\nhey we have some new clients that attach\nthat's new to our fire side database.\n\n193\n00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:51.546\nSo, I don't know how important this is.\n\n194\n00:08:51.546 --> 00:08:55.547\nSo, let's go to analyses back to\nconnection events for a second.\n\n195\n00:08:55.547 --> 00:08:57.063\nSo, this is going to show me,\n\n196\n00:08:57.063 --> 00:09:01.840\nthe first stage is going to show me\nthe last 25 connections that I've seen.\n\n197\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.650\nAnd, here's our problem here.\n\n198\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.030\nNot only I can see the responder\ncountry here, here's Brasil.\n\n199\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.490\nAnd, from my ingress and egress.\n\n200\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.310\nIn this example here we have\nsome configured zones, right.\n\n201\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.610\nNow, and it's gonna tell me\nnow is this IP monitor bad?\n\n202\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.400\nAbsolutely not.\n\n203\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.550\nRemember we have that monitor access\ncontrol policy that says hey,\n\n204\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.360\nif something connects,\nI wanna know about it.\n\n205\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.830\nAnd that's what it says here.\n\n206\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.470\nAnd it's from the outside here,\nand we haven't connected so\n\n207\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.710\nwe don't got any FireSIGHT data,\nso it's kind of neither of these.\n\n208\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.398\nRight?\nSo, and\n\n209\n00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:35.962\nit came from the USA going to the USA,\nand so on.\n\n210\n00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:40.842\nHere's an interactive block with reset,\nand again, now what you want, it's very\n\n211\n00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:45.463\ntempting to come over here, and click on\nthis IP address, this URL IP address.\n\n212\n00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:50.421\nAll this does is say, show me all\nthe events with this IP address, right?\n\n213\n00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:53.503\nIt doesn't actually show you\nthe problem with that IP address.\n\n214\n00:09:53.503 --> 00:09:55.820\nIt just says,\ntake me to page on here, okay.\n\n215\n00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.130\nSo, we got on to IP monitor\nintrusion blocks, and so on.\n\n216\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.950\nThe other thing we can do is take a look\nat our dashboard, overview dashboard.\n\n217\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.800\nAgain, I know a lot of\npeople that use this.\n\n218\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.207\nIt's not my, I still on context explorer,\n\n219\n00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:13.730\nbut I know a lot of people that\nuse this again because it's what?\n\n220\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.440\nIt's customizable,\nwith great custom widgets and we can\n\n221\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.780\nmove them around we're gonna see here that\nwe can easily do reporting on there, and\n\n222\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.500\nmaybe we'll do that today still,\nbut you know what?\n\n223\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.171\nIf you see something like this guys,\nyou've got a serious problem here.\n\n224\n00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:30.360\nGo disconnect your internet until\nyou can get this fixed cuz,\n\n225\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.298\nlook at this if this came up and\nit has popped up like this,\n\n226\n00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:37.430\nyou're having a Zero Day attack and you're\ngonna have a very bad day right now.\n\n227\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.860\nThe best thing you can do is\njust disconnect everything.\n\n228\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.980\nSo, you can see in the last hour here, our\nintrusion events, there are a thousand.\n\n229\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.840\nSo this is really crazy.\n\n230\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.730\nSo let me come back over here.\n\n231\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.670\nLet's see if I click\nthe right one this time.\n\n232\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.270\nIf we're looking at this one, I have all\nthese events and then I'm gonna come over\n\n233\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.600\nhere and I'm gonna see,\nI don't don't have any data on this one.\n\n234\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.760\nThis one's not necessarily\nbad to see like this one, but\n\n235\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.210\nthis is my other pod with very few hosts.\n\n236\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.200\nAnd we haven't had any\nattacks on this one.\n\n237\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.490\nSo if you see something like this,\nI'm not saying this isn't necessarily bad.\n\n238\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.670\nBecause all of these are over here,\nlike if we look in here,\n\n239\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.400\nthese are all intrusion events.\n\n240\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.590\nSo if we see something here then it's bad.\n\n241\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.004\nAnd so threats.\n\n242\n00:11:19.004 --> 00:11:22.544\nOne of the other things that I want\nto show you while we're on this page,\n\n243\n00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:24.740\nalmost changing the subject but not quite.\n\n244\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.796\nOverview dashboard status, right.\n\n245\n00:11:26.796 --> 00:11:31.837\nThis is a really good page to get an\nunderstanding what's going on your device.\n\n246\n00:11:31.837 --> 00:11:35.274\nAnd it becomes very important\nbecause we have to make sure\n\n247\n00:11:35.274 --> 00:11:38.068\nwe understand the code\nthat we're running and\n\n248\n00:11:38.068 --> 00:11:42.290\nthat what's called the fingerprint\nof virtual database, the VDB.\n\n249\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.670\nAnd this is gonna tell\nme those right here and\n\n250\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.171\nwho's the last time I had\nmy snort rule update?\n\n251\n00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.546\nIt's gonna come up here in a second.\n\n252\n00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:50.547\nBut what this fingerprint is,\nis what are the latest snort rules?\n\n253\n00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:53.100\nWhat did we find out?\n\n254\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.810\nYou know what are the biggest attacks?\n\n255\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.880\nAnd so you know this VDV is like hey\nyou want to have the latest one.\n\n256\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.190\nHowever be careful with that.\n\n257\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.470\nDon't run out and upgrade to the latest\none or update to the latest one.\n\n258\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.040\nIt may have a bug or cause some problems.\n\n259\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.930\nI've seen that.\n\n260\n00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.378\nThe other thing is if I'm doing\na backup I always come to this screen.\n\n261\n00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:16.090\nSo I'm backing up my defense, or\nI'm backing up my configuration, or\n\n262\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.950\nI'm backing up my data.\n\n263\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.140\nThe fact is I name my backup what\nthis says right here, 5.4.1.2 248.\n\n264\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.860\nI actually name it that because if I ever\nrestore it has to be exactly the same\n\n265\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.770\nupdate software and\nit has to be the same fingerprint.\n\n266\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.340\nSo I always name my backups\nthese numbers right here.\n\n267\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.060\nSo that's an important piece\ntoday that I wanted to go over.\n\n268\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.141\nAll right, so\nif I go to analysis connection events,\n\n269\n00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:42.754\nI need to show you something\nelse here real quick.\n\n270\n00:12:47.296 --> 00:12:51.440\nAnd we're looking at these events here.\n\n271\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.245\nI'm on the wrong one here.\n\n272\n00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:57.129\n[LAUGH] So let's try that again.\n\n273\n00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.850\n[LAUGH] Analysis, come on,\nanalysis connection event.\n\n274\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.180\nAnd now we can do something\ncalled switching workflows, so\n\n275\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.710\nwe can basically look at some different\nworkflows and how these help us.\n\n276\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.629\nSo, in this case here, we're looking at\nconnections with the application details.\n\n277\n00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:13.910\nLet's take a look at something different,\n\n278\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.224\na lot of times I wanna see my connections\nby initiator or connections by responder,\n\n279\n00:13:18.224 --> 00:13:20.586\nso a lot of times where\nmy problems come from?\n\n280\n00:13:20.586 --> 00:13:22.588\nFrom an initiator right?\n\n281\n00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:27.460\nInitiator should be a client and so\nI'll be able to see Top talkers and\n\n282\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.810\nthings like that.\n\n283\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.611\nAnd if an issue is a client and it\ndepends like we wanna see something here,\n\n284\n00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:37.338\nlike sometimes I'll go over here and\ninitiate are IP is.\n\n285\n00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:39.296\nOkay, now, this is a lot here, right.\n\n286\n00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.046\nThis is 13,000.\n\n287\n00:13:41.046 --> 00:13:44.316\nSo I wanna know why so I wanna come\nout here and look at this and say,\n\n288\n00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:48.320\nwhy is this host here which is\nan internal host have 13,000 connections.\n\n289\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.560\nRight.\nSo I, one\n\n290\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.460\ntime I was at a client I'm looking at\nthis and the other ones have like two or\n\n291\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.340\nthree and one of them had like 20,000.\n\n292\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.790\nI'm like, well, we seriously have\na problem or something like this.\n\n293\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.310\nSo, I go out there and\nI'm looking at this.\n\n294\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.790\nI wanna analyze what's going on.\n\n295\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.600\nAnd I went out and I found out it\nwas a What's Up Gold Server right.\n\n296\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.400\nWhich is kinda like a network\nanalysis tool that goes around and\n\n297\n00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.850\npings everything in the network, and\nconnects to the network constantly,\n\n298\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.470\nwhich then kinda makes sense, and I was\nable to take this IP and suppress it, and\n\n299\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.610\nsay, okay, I don't wanna see this.\n\n300\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.520\nSo this kinda gave me and\nidea of what's going on in my network.\n\n301\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.500\nIn this case here, these are bad.\n\n302\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.950\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n303\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.580\nOn this pod, we're doing a lot of attacks.\n\n304\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.837\nBut you're gonna have to look at this and\nfind out, is it really bad?\n\n305\n00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:31.045\nWhat kinda server is it and\nwhat's the application?\n\n306\n00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:34.929\nNow at this point I can jump\nto the things up on top here,\n\n307\n00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:39.504\nsecurity intelligence events,\nintrusion events, and so on.\n\n308\n00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:43.597\nSo again, if I come down here Security\nintelligent events is my white and\n\n309\n00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:44.880\nblack list isn't it?\n\n310\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.879\nSo I'm gathering data here on what's going\non, I'm looking to see some events here.\n\n311\n00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:51.587\nAnd this is not necessarily bad.\n\n312\n00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:55.670\nIt depends, so\nwe have to look at this and find out.\n\n313\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.486\nThese are security intelligence,\nwhere they whitelist or blacklist it and\n\n314\n00:14:58.486 --> 00:14:59.505\nthey're coming through.\n\n315\n00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:02.700\nIn this case here, we're seeing the\nconnection to the IP monitor allowed this.\n\n316\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.130\nAnd it's showing us that this was okay,\n\n317\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.640\nbecause we create this montior that\nsays show me a connection here.\n\n318\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.790\nThe other thing, so\nlet's switch the workflow again, and\n\n319\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.820\nnot under security intelligence events,\nI want it be connection event.\n\n320\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.152\nAnd switch the workflow, and\n\n321\n00:15:16.152 --> 00:15:21.754\nthen we'll head on to users and\nreporting today.\n\n322\n00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:22.942\nAll right?\nSo when I come down here,\n\n323\n00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:24.090\nI'll go to switch the workflow.\n\n324\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.890\nAnd let's say read\nconnections by responder now.\n\n325\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.660\nLet's see who our biggest\nresponder is on my network.\n\n326\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.340\nSo these are some of\nthe things that you do.\n\n327\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.110\nYou go out there and\n\n328\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.330\nyou find out who your top talkers are,\nwho's the biggest responder.\n\n329\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:42.110\nNow, I'm gonna come out here and go,\nwell, this guy better be a server.\n\n330\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.250\nWhy is this guy responding\nwith 67,000 connections?\n\n331\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.960\nSo I sure hope that's my web server\nin my DMZ, something like that.\n\n332\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.100\nBecause if not then we got a problem.\n\n333\n00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.911\nBut in this case here I'm gonna look in\nhere, we can see that this is typical\n\n334\n00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:59.379\nsmall server, file server,\nsales server, something like that.\n\n335\n00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:00.296\nBut this isn't.\n\n336\n00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:02.338\nAll right, so we're gonna take\na look at this and find out.\n\n337\n00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:04.609\nSo you want to see,\nI always tell my students,\n\n338\n00:16:04.609 --> 00:16:08.129\ngo out and look at connection by\ninitiator, connection by responder.\n\n339\n00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:08.879\nFind out who they are.\n\n340\n00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:10.005\nIs this normal?\n\n341\n00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:10.753\nFine.\n\n342\n00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:14.480\nSuppress it if you want to, or at least\nwhen you see it, you know what it is.\n\n343\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.420\nOkay.\n\n344\n00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.460\n>> And during discovery we expect\nto see a lot of new data coming in.\n\n345\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.516\n>> Absolutely.\n>> It might be perfectly normal but\n\n346\n00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:24.504\nit's up to us to kinda make\nthat determination, right?\n\n347\n00:16:24.504 --> 00:16:25.132\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n348\n00:16:25.132 --> 00:16:28.250\nSo let's go ahead and and\nyou guys wanna keep playing with this,\n\n349\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.485\ndo the switch workflows,\nwe don't have to do the necessarily jump\n\n350\n00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:34.429\nto it because it basically takes\nus to this stuff up here, but\n\n351\n00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:38.160\non here this allows us to do\nunique initiators by responders.\n\n352\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.090\nUnique responders by a initiator okay,\nso I can come in here again,\n\n353\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.980\nsee some of this stuff and\nfind out what is this.\n\n354\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.810\nTake a look at this and\nfind out if this is okay.\n\n355\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.724\nWhat's not okay is that you don't look\nat this and find out what's going on and\n\n356\n00:16:53.724 --> 00:16:55.338\nwho is your top talkers and why.\n\n357\n00:16:55.338 --> 00:16:57.212\nAnd these guys are going to show you that.\n\n358\n00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:57.796\nOkay.\n\n359\n00:16:57.796 --> 00:16:59.754\nSo we're going to go ahead\na wrap up this section.\n\n360\n00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:03.987\nI'm gonna use Serpa's authority\nat this point [LAUGH] and\n\n361\n00:17:03.987 --> 00:17:07.968\nsay I'm Todd Langley and\nthis is the end and your Don.\n\n362\n00:17:07.968 --> 00:17:08.680\n>> [LAUGH] I'm that guy.\n\n363\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.230\nSo that's our rundown\non Network Discovery.\n\n364\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.900\nKeep Mind that it is important.\n\n365\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.550\nit is something you've got to do and Todd\nsuggested even in a production environment\n\n366\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.550\nwith heavy clients you\nmight have to wait two or\n\n367\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.680\nthree days before those analysis\nscreens are every useful.\n\n368\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.990\nThen we definitely have to review that.\n\n369\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.921\nNow, we've got more we need to talk about,\nwe need to jump into user management,\n\n370\n00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:27.921\na few other topics that we're\ngoing to see as we move on.\n\n371\n00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:32.427\nBut for now it is a good spot to wrap this\none up so we'll do that right here signing\n\n372\n00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.005\noff for ITPro TV I'm Don Pezet\n>> I'm Todd Langley\n\n373\n00:17:35.005 --> 00:17:36.837\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n374\n00:17:36.837 --> 00:17:42.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.500\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.530\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.300\nback again with another\nepisode of Cisco FirePower.\n\n6\n00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.020\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at, well, user management.\n\n7\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.060\nI know I always say, my network would run\ngreat if it weren't for all these users.\n\n8\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.520\nWell unfortunately,\nwe can't get away from that.\n\n9\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.540\nWe're gonna have users,\nwe're gonna have to make use of that and\n\n10\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.950\nactually deal with that\ninside of FirePOWER.\n\n11\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.530\nI know we've seen some of the ALDP\nintegration we can have when we start\n\n12\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.570\npulling in users.\n\n13\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.770\nWell there's a bit more\nto it than just that.\n\n14\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.680\nSo here to walk us through the rest of\nthe topic we've got Mr. Todd Lammie.\n\n15\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.590\nTodd, thanks for being here.\n\n16\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.003\n>> Thank you, great to be back.\n\n17\n00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:51.800\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.190\ntalk about how we administrate\nthis product, who can log in.\n\n19\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.130\nNow there's an admin user built in, but\nwe don't wanna keep the admin user,\n\n20\n00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.580\nwe want people to log in with their name\nso we can track them in our audit log.\n\n21\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.010\nWe also wanna send that audit log to\na syslog so if they come in there and\n\n22\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.480\nthey can delete something out of\nthe auto log if they have those rights,\n\n23\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.650\nyou still have it on the syslog.\n\n24\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.130\nSo you can figure out what occurred,\nif anything.\n\n25\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.010\nNow that being said, we're gonna go back\nto my screen here and let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.250\ntake a look at this.\n\n27\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.340\nSo let's go ahead and go to system.\n\n28\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.390\nSo we'll go to system, local.\n\n29\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.710\nAnd we have our system policy and\nconfiguration, we've gone through that.\n\n30\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.350\nAnd we'll go to user management.\n\n31\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.680\nSo we have local users, and\nwe have external users.\n\n32\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.780\nMost people use some sort of external\nmethod that's easy to connect up to our AD\n\n33\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.740\nservers, and to our adapt,\nand just boom log in.\n\n34\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.910\nSo and we'll go ahead and do that now.\n\n35\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.040\nIn this case here,\nI see that I have some users in here.\n\n36\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.650\nThat, from some of the people that were\non my pod, or something like that.\n\n37\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.040\nSo, and that's fine.\n\n38\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.590\nThe one thing is, is we can create users.\n\n39\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.330\nI can't just create a new local user here,\n\n40\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.540\nuntil I can figure an external\nauthentication method.\n\n41\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.160\nIn this case here, you can see we\nhave some users, they are enabled.\n\n42\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.020\nBut the one thing is there's\nsome built in user rolls.\n\n43\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.960\nNow we can go ahead and\nuse these rolls and to our advantage and\n\n44\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.180\nsay hey they already spent all the time\non that, why should I create my own roll?\n\n45\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.730\nAnd I'm gonna show you why and\nhow you create your own roll.\n\n46\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.860\nBut in this case here we can see that\nwe have some different rolls here and\n\n47\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.040\naccess admin,\nadministrator discovery admin.\n\n48\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.470\nAnd we can read all about these.\n\n49\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.050\nYou can go to my book.\n\n50\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.410\nOr you can go out, you know,\nand search for these.\n\n51\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.420\nAnd it'll give you, actually,\n\n52\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.090\nthat information about what\nthese are going to do.\n\n53\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.590\nThis is actually in the same screen, where\nwe're gonna do, external authentication.\n\n54\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.760\nAnd the CSM signal sign on is\nsomething that we'll see on our ASAs,\n\n55\n00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.080\nbecause we can do down here to our ASAs,\nour ASDM.\n\n56\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.690\nAnd then log in through our fire power,\nthrough a single login, and\n\n57\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.740\nwe're not logged in and\ncan get an analysis and\n\n58\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.380\ninformation on RASDM about\nRESA with fire power, right.\n\n59\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.060\nSo this allows me to\nhave the single log in.\n\n60\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.430\nIt is a little complicated set up and\nI'm not gonna show it here, and\n\n61\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.000\nit's okay if you're using SDM or CSM.\n\n62\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.070\nThis allows me to have a single lung into\nthe firepower module through my ASS or\n\n63\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.920\nCRM, right?\n\n64\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.570\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n65\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.540\nIt's just that you would only\nprobably do that in a larger network.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.350\nOkay in this case here,\nwe only have our user rules, and\n\n67\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.400\nagain I can go ahead and\nin this case here I can copy these and\n\n68\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.270\nI can say take this role and\nthen I can manipulate it.\n\n69\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.160\nAnd then I can go ahead and use this role.\n\n70\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.510\nSo let's do something very simple here.\n\n71\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.123\nLet's just Leave these roles as it is and\nwe'll come back to this in a second.\n\n72\n00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:38.942\nWhen we come here to users, And I'm gonna\nsay, I wanna create a new username,\n\n73\n00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:39.620\nTodd, right.\n\n74\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.160\nIn this case, I'm logged in as\nadmin we don't want that any more.\n\n75\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.010\nSo we'll say the username is Todd.\n\n76\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.850\nAnd I could, at this point say use\nExternal Authentication method and\n\n77\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.920\nif it's Configured, and I'll just lobby\nto do it and it'll start working.\n\n78\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.510\nOkay, so notice all of my password and\nall that goes away, and\n\n79\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.800\nhave exempt from user browser session\ntime out here, that's an option.\n\n80\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.080\nBut if I become administrator\nthat's not an option here.\n\n81\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.780\nAnd remember, in the system policy,\nI showed you that,\n\n82\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.560\ntowards the bottom of the system policy,\nit has your browser settings.\n\n83\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.520\nAnd that is, remember, by default,\nit's 60 minutes, or for time out.\n\n84\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.000\nI usually set it long,\nbecause I'm not in production.\n\n85\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.490\nIf you're in production,\nplease, just leave it alone.\n\n86\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.520\nWe want that to time out.\n\n87\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.780\nSo why the heck would I have exempt\nfrom browser session timeout.\n\n88\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.400\nSeems like I could go out and go to the\nbathroom, someone could come behind me and\n\n89\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.000\nsay, hey what is this new policy.\n\n90\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.020\nI want to delete this policy,\nI don't whatever, I don't know,\n\n91\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.640\nthey can create some damage, right?\n\n92\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.870\nSo why wouldn't you want that to timeout?\n\n93\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.940\nWell the answer is is because I'm\ngonna just make it something like,\n\n94\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.206\nI don't know, Security Admin,\nhow about Security Analyst, Read Only?\n\n95\n00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:47.050\nAnd in this case here, then I'm\ngonna log in as this user in my and\n\n96\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.390\nI'm gonna put it on the screen and\nwe're gonna be able to watch it.\n\n97\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.920\nI'm gonna be able to watch my\ncontent explorer, my dashboard, or\n\n98\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.990\nsomething like that.\n\n99\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.600\nAnd the browser wouldn't time out,\npretty strait forward.\n\n100\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.790\nSo let's do that, exempt from time out.\n\n101\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.050\nLet's make Todd a security\nanalyst read only.\n\n102\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.500\nNow before I log in as Todd, first off\nI've gotta get rid of the external.\n\n103\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.351\nAnd I'll set the password.\n\n104\n00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:14.106\nAnd then you have max number of\nfail log in, user gets locked out,\n\n105\n00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:17.280\nminimum password lengths days and\ntells us exploration.\n\n106\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.410\nNow one of the things you\ncan do is set the password\n\n107\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.570\njust to password and when they log in,\nit asks them to set their password.\n\n108\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.170\nThat's very typical.\n\n109\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.580\nWe set that.\n\n110\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.190\nAlso check password strength.\n\n111\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.010\nI'm not going to do that here,\nwe're in a demo.\n\n112\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.400\nOkay.\nExempt, I'm security analyst read only,\n\n113\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.620\nwe're going to see what that\nmeans right after this.\n\n114\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.520\nBut, I want you to look at these up here,\nwhat I see here.\n\n115\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.780\nI can do over view,\nI can do analysis on anything.\n\n116\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.230\nI can create any type of policy I want.\n\n117\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.870\nCreate, delete, add, whatever.\n\n118\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.270\nI can add devices, and take them away.\n\n119\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.830\nI can create objects and so on.\n\n120\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.840\nSo let's go ahead and save Todd, and\n\n121\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.240\nsee what this guy has,\nsecurity analyst read only can do.\n\n122\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.342\nI bet he, you know, can't do much.\n\n123\n00:06:02.342 --> 00:06:05.080\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm gonna come under admin here,\n\n124\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.620\nand I'm gonna log out.\n\n125\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.870\nI actually hit user preference,\nthis is kind of a cool little screen.\n\n126\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.670\nSo before I let me show you this.\n\n127\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.790\nI can change the password from here,\nso if I was logged in as Todd,\n\n128\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.040\nit would still let me change my password.\n\n129\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.320\nI can set my home page\nevent view settings.\n\n130\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.260\nSo, what this here is kind of interesting\nbecause when I go to Context Explorer,\n\n131\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.990\nI want to see.\n\n132\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.110\nSee something unique like let's say I want\nto see unique responders by initiator.\n\n133\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.830\nYou know, something like that.\n\n134\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.390\nSomething we could look to easier and\n\n135\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.730\nI want that to be the page\nI go to all the time.\n\n136\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.310\nSo I can set those here when I go to\ncontext explorer then set my own page,\n\n137\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.710\ntime zone, preference and dashboard.\n\n138\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.900\nSo, you've got some little\nconfiguration you can do there.\n\n139\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.131\nBut let me log out right here and\nthen I'm going to log in as Todd.\n\n140\n00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:59.630\nAnd we'll see what this guy can do.\n\n141\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.540\nSo the first thing we're gonna do is we're\ngonna notice that you can't do anything.\n\n142\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.660\nSo he can look at the overview and\nhe can do some analysis but\n\n143\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.340\nthere's no policies here.\n\n144\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.360\nThere's nothing else here.\n\n145\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.380\nThere's no object.\n\n146\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.570\nThere's nothing.\nOkay.\n\n147\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.230\nOver there there's not\neven a system screen.\n\n148\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.830\nYou can't even go to the system policy and\nchange anything.\n\n149\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.690\nWhen you go on to the help,\nthere's no help policy, self monitor and\n\n150\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.340\nhelp advance but the help policy is gone.\n\n151\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.110\nRight.\nSo this guy can't do anything in.\n\n152\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.200\nWhat a loser.\n\n153\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.150\nAll right.\n\n154\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.990\nSo let's get this slug out of time.\n\n155\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.180\nAnd-\n>> We might not wanna set\n\n156\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.120\nsomebody up with a login that has nothing,\nbut you might wanna set somebody up with\n\n157\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.740\nreally little access if it was maybe a\nhelpdesk, or a network operations center.\n\n158\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.680\nYou don't wanna give them\nthe ability to dive in and\n\n159\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.780\nsee things that could compromise us, but\nyou do want them to see status, right?\n\n160\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.300\n>> Yeah, I agree.\n\n161\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.000\nAnd so we're gonna take look at that now.\n\n162\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.630\nAnd what he was just saying is.\n\n163\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.210\nLet's create that rule that says\nwhat do we want them to see.\n\n164\n00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.280\nAnd we can be very granule.\n\n165\n00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.590\nAnd now I'm logged in as Todd, and\n\n166\n00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.860\nyou can see that I've got Todd\nlike powers again right here.\n\n167\n00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.730\nSo system local user management and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.000\ncreate a role for our help desk,\nand it should mention that.\n\n169\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.200\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and.\n\n170\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.600\nNot be in a hurry and\nwe'll say Create User Role.\n\n171\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.281\nThen you'll see how granular we can be and\nwe're gonna name this Helpdesk.\n\n172\n00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:22.950\nNow, these are all the things that\nI can do on a FireSIGHT system.\n\n173\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.720\nEverything's listed here.\n\n174\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.950\nDoesn't look like it but it is.\n\n175\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.540\nIf you open all these up\nthis is extremely detailed.\n\n176\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.890\nI'm gonna say well I want them to do\noverview, but I don't want to be able to\n\n177\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.780\njust do reporting, so I'll click that and\nthen no reporting, something like that.\n\n178\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.450\nBut notice they can get summaries and\ndashboard, and we can see what's in there,\n\n179\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.990\nand there was quite a bit.\n\n180\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.690\nI want him to do analysis, but\nI don't want him to be able to do.\n\n181\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:55.670\nAnalysis, I want to do\nContext Explorer in connection events.\n\n182\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.190\nAnd, notice this now, this is the very\nsame thing that came up here.\n\n183\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.210\nBecause since when we go into\nthese production environments they\n\n184\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.100\nhave literally, millions of events.\n\n185\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.030\nAnd, so you ended up doing searches,\nand you can search through them.\n\n186\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.860\nWhat we can do is create a search profile,\ngo out there and\n\n187\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.570\nsave it and then tell this guy,\nthis user, this help desk in this case,\n\n188\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.190\nexactly the search they can use,\nthe only search.\n\n189\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.230\nSo this actually might be helpful if\nyou think about this, because we want\n\n190\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.440\nthem to search for a certain type of event\nthrough all these millions of events,\n\n191\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.140\nand we can actually create the search and\nthen they just click on it.\n\n192\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.310\nSo this is actually kind of a cool thing.\n\n193\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.680\nI don't have any saved searches in here,\nbut I can create some and do it,\n\n194\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.741\nit's pretty simple.\n\n195\n00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.091\n>> And that would be a great way to just\nminimize the data that they're exposed to,\n\n196\n00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:40.654\ncuz there could be some sensitive\nstuff in there [CROSSTALK].\n\n197\n00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:45.456\nEspecially if you've got your true,\nwhere you're sending the full\n\n198\n00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:49.940\npacket content to the box to\nthe defense center and the thing is.\n\n199\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.480\nWe're saying, hey.\n\n200\n00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.700\nWe want you to search so,\njust click on this and\n\n201\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.740\nwe don't have to give them any training or\nanything.\n\n202\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.600\nThey just click on it and so, very cool.\n\n203\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.030\nAnd, security intelligence events.\n\n204\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:05.130\nWe can come through here and\nwe can look for vulnerabilities.\n\n205\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.470\nVery simple stuff,\nthird-party vulnerabilities.\n\n206\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.370\nAnd we want to know the health but\nwe can be very specific on the health and\n\n207\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.610\nsay we don't want the health policy,\n\n208\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.010\nnotice we can click down here get\nsome really detailed stuff in here.\n\n209\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.110\nIt's health events, I'm going to save.\n\n210\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.690\nSo now I've got this guy and he's been\nlogged in and now we've got Todd and\n\n211\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.070\nwe're going to make him.\n\n212\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.370\nHe's right now, I think he's\nsecurity analyst read only, so\n\n213\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.450\nwe actually are giving\nhim less powers now.\n\n214\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.125\n[LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:39.775\nSo, I'm going to change him, so no if we\nlook down here we'll see that there is\n\n216\n00:10:39.775 --> 00:10:46.770\na help desk, and so I'm going to choose\nthat, and now he's part of help desk.\n\n217\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.260\nSo let's talk about a couple more things.\n\n218\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.530\nAnd one of those is,\nlet's say, I don't know.\n\n219\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.890\nThis is kind of far fetched,\nbut here is an example.\n\n220\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.030\nSo, you're the only one\nthat has admin rights.\n\n221\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.520\nAnd the help desk can only give you\nthe connection events, and, you know,\n\n222\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.050\nwhat we gave them, right?\n\n223\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.740\nSo we only have those events.\n\n224\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.630\nHowever, you're away from the network.\n\n225\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.795\nAt the time maybe, I don't know\nSuper Bowl party or something so\n\n226\n00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:14.060\n[LAUGH] and\nyou don't have your laptop with you.\n\n227\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.350\nOh, my God, are you kidding me?\n\n228\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.750\nSo you can't VPN in to fix problem but\nthey call you and\n\n229\n00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.690\nsay hey we're seeing this lot of IoCs or\nsomething like that.\n\n230\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.470\nAnd we know we probably have to go out and\n\n231\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.600\nblacklist something because maybe\nwe're have a zero-day attack.\n\n232\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.790\nSo the fact is,\nis that you can't get in so\n\n233\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.020\nyou can set up these users that are in\nthis roll, to escalate their permissions.\n\n234\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.690\nSo this may be something you use or\n\n235\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.140\nmaybe something you don't use\nbecause the reality is is\n\n236\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.510\nif you're in charge of something like\nthis, you probably have your laptop.\n\n237\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.480\nYou'll probably be able to put a VPN\nin cuz they're gonna call you so\n\n238\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.960\nyou're gonna be prepared for that.\n\n239\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.380\nThis is just for\nthe ultimate emergency, right?\n\n240\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.260\nSo we're gonna come back here under user\nroles, and I'm gonna come over here and\n\n241\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.360\nI'm gonna say configure,\npermission escalation.\n\n242\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.210\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nokay I want this guy Todd,\n\n243\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.710\nwho's at a help desk role, to be\nescalated to whatever I want it to be.\n\n244\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.620\nIn this case it's administrator.\n\n245\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.500\nI can say, access admin,\nI can create a role in here, and\n\n246\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.600\nsay, that's what I want to escalate to.\n\n247\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.260\nIn this case here,\nwe'll just leave it as administrator.\n\n248\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.760\nAnd say,\nokay they can escalate to administrator.\n\n249\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.560\nThen I'll come back under this help\ndesk roll, so now that's configured.\n\n250\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.512\nI'll come into here, and I'll say notice I\nhave this thing set this roll to escalate\n\n251\n00:12:27.512 --> 00:12:32.328\nto administrator and authenticate with\ntheir user, or the specified users, and\n\n252\n00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:35.922\nwe'll just say assign users password and\nwe'll save this.\n\n253\n00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:39.802\nNoe I'm gonna log back out.\n\n254\n00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:43.644\nAnd log back in as Todd.\n\n255\n00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:52.595\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and see that he\ndoesn't have any rights, he's a help desk.\n\n256\n00:12:52.595 --> 00:12:55.825\nHe can give me some information,\n\n257\n00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:58.825\nyou're not authorized to view this widget,\nyou suck.\n\n258\n00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:03.005\nAll right, so, basically we can't\nsee anything, so Todd calls,\n\n259\n00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:04.775\nhey I'm seeing some IOC's or whatever.\n\n260\n00:13:04.775 --> 00:13:07.665\nAnd, so we're going to say okay Todd,\ngo up under your name,\n\n261\n00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:09.945\nI can't get to my VPN, go under your name.\n\n262\n00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:12.280\nAnd, now we have an escalate\npermissions here.\n\n263\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.340\nAnd I said go ahead and type in this\npassword, and I give him the password.\n\n264\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.160\nAnd now we'll watch this boom.\n\n265\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.890\nThey got all of of this.\n\n266\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.500\nNow at this point you probably\nwant to create something\n\n267\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.530\nto escalate to that's not administrator.\n\n268\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.520\nBut in this example I just\nmade an administrator.\n\n269\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.340\nSo because then you got\nto tell them to log out.\n\n270\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.470\nNow what happens if they don't.\n\n271\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.750\nWell remember this is in the audit so\nsystem, system monitoring audit,\n\n272\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.880\nall of this is in here.\n\n273\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.250\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at it actually.\n\n274\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.080\nWe're going to see that Todd's\nsystem audit Permission escalation,\n\n275\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.220\nright there on time.\n\n276\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.180\nThat's the permissions to administrator\nand so basically we want to send to cis\n\n277\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.590\nlog because if he does this,\nyou know we gave him the password.\n\n278\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.275\nYou know that Todd guy's pretty wily,\nso we just can't trust him.\n\n279\n00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:59.541\nAnyway, before we can change the password,\nVPN and change the password,\n\n280\n00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:03.345\nwe're just gonna ask it again,\ncome in here and take that out,\n\n281\n00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.685\nthat's why we send it to the syslog.\n\n282\n00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:09.505\nThat being said, there's just\none more thing in here guys, and\n\n283\n00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:12.275\nuser management is fun, it's easy, and\n\n284\n00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:16.560\nthat's external authentication, So,\nin this case here, we have local users.\n\n285\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.260\nNotice I had my LDAP.\n\n286\n00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.000\nI've already configured it again.\n\n287\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.040\nIt's not configured by default.\n\n288\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.800\nBut remember there's something under\nthe system policy this has to do with,\n\n289\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.800\nand we'll go take a look\nat that real quick.\n\n290\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.980\nSo, just a couple more minutes.\n\n291\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.290\nI can create external objects.\n\n292\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.460\nLet's just configure,\ntake a look at this one what I did.\n\n293\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.240\nThe hardest part about this\nis getting your information,\n\n294\n00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.680\nyour IP address and\nthe rights to be able to do that.\n\n295\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.740\nSo I'm going to say it's LDAP.\n\n296\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.350\nThe other option under here is radius.\n\n297\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.310\nYou can use radius.\n\n298\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.210\nI highly don't think you should do that.\n\n299\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.230\nLet's use LDAP.\n\n300\n00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.440\nHere's my name, and I'm gonna use AD,\nand IP address, and\n\n301\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.030\nthen I fetch my distinguished name, and\nI get my user name and password in there.\n\n302\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.390\nI think I, oh yeah it's right there,\nuser name, password, and\n\n303\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:06.300\nthen notice I have, here's my\ngroup access control rules, right?\n\n304\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.090\nSo here's my rules I can get and my,\nI can change these different rules\n\n305\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.060\nbased on the external access here so\nthat's kinda interesting,\n\n306\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.870\nand then additional test parameters\nmeans I created my user.\n\n307\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.670\nAnd is external and I wanna test him,\n\n308\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.790\nI can test him from here,\nsee if he's gonna work.\n\n309\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.990\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n310\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.500\nThis case here I'll just test it and\nsee if I've configured it right.\n\n311\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.350\nI don't even remember if I did.\n\n312\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.110\nWe'll find out!\n\n313\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.690\nSo I hit Test and [LAUGH] no it did not.\n\n314\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.890\nSo, I kinda haven't quite finished this\nbut when you do go ahead and test that.\n\n315\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.780\nAnd this is important but once you\nconfigure this, this is important, so\n\n316\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.610\nwe're gonna come back here\nto the System Policy.\n\n317\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.440\nI'm going here System Policy, so\none last thing guys, hang in there.\n\n318\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.277\nI would say that as we're getting\ncloser to the end of the day.\n\n319\n00:15:47.277 --> 00:15:48.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n320\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.480\nSo, here's the one we're using here.\n\n321\n00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.170\nThe demo system policy.\n\n322\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.090\nAnd there was.\n\n323\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.130\nRemember I showed this to you yesterday.\n\n324\n00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.490\nThe external authentication.\n\n325\n00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.830\nRight.\nThat's part of this.\n\n326\n00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.950\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a quick look at that.\n\n327\n00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.010\nSo, here it is.\n\n328\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:00.510\nRight here.\n\n329\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.750\nExternal authentication.\n\n330\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.470\nThere it is right there.\n\n331\n00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.230\nAnd it's not enabled.\n\n332\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.730\nThat's why it didn't work.\n\n333\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.030\nSo I'm gonna turn that on,\nsay there was no users and so on.\n\n334\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.750\nSo in this case here, I have to come\nin here, I'm gonna enable it there and\n\n335\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.010\nthen I have a default role.\n\n336\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.580\nIf I have a local user and\nI have external authentication configured,\n\n337\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.740\nthat local user will automatically\nconfigure to an external user.\n\n338\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.230\nAnd then he'll be disabled,\nhe can't be a local user anymore.\n\n339\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.170\nAnd he'll get this role,\nsince you don't have a role for him,\n\n340\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.040\nhe'll get this default role,\nwhatever you choose.\n\n341\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.640\nSo we are not going to seat there and\nchoose administrator.\n\n342\n00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.890\nOkay, so we are going to enable this.\n\n343\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.850\nThis is kinda why it didn't work.\n\n344\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.830\nSo it never finished configuring this\nokay, and I'm gonna say, I don't know,\n\n345\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.460\ntheir intrusion admin.\n\n346\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.120\nThat's my default.\n\n347\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.260\nOr maybe I sit there and say, hey,\n\n348\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.060\nif I didn't give them,\nthey're just a security analyst.\n\n349\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.590\nThat's my default role.\n\n350\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.920\nSo I'm gonna save this policy and\nexit, and\n\n351\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.950\nnow I have my external\nconfiguration done for my users.\n\n352\n00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.490\nSo you have to go out there and\n\n353\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.100\ndo it by the users, and\nset that up under user management.\n\n354\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.810\nAnd then come out here to\nyour system policy as well.\n\n355\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.110\n>> Excellent.\n\n356\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.220\nSo, once that's done,\nwe've got our users in there to setup.\n\n357\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.670\nI know, personally, I always like it when\nwe do external authentication because if\n\n358\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.340\nI have one user kinda use everywhere,\nand if I need to change my password.\n\n359\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.220\nI know that I change it one place,\nit's kinda changed everywhere.\n\n360\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.050\n>> Yes.\n>> So, it does make life a lot easier.\n\n361\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.820\nIf you're a one-man shop and you're\nrunning the whole thing by yourself.\n\n362\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.610\nYou might not care about that so much, but\nwhen you have several network engineers.\n\n363\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.460\nYou getting a lot of\npeople working the system.\n\n364\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.930\nIt's definitely a useful thing to have so,\nit's good to see it all integrated.\n\n365\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.165\nWell, Todd that's probably a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n366\n00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:29.455\nI know we don't have necessarily\nthe most giant volume of knowledge\n\n367\n00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:33.395\non adding user accounts here, it's pretty\nstraight forward, but it is important.\n\n368\n00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:35.935\nWe do have a lot more that we want to talk\nabout on fire power that's going to be\n\n369\n00:17:35.935 --> 00:17:40.410\ncoming up in our next episodes, but\nfor now this is a good spot to wrap\n\n370\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.180\nthis one up so, signing off for\nITPro TV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n371\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.340\n>> Todd Lammle.\n\n372\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.305\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n373\n00:17:49.305 --> 00:17:52.454\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.740\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.050\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Cisco Fire Power.\n\n5\n00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.420\nNow, in our previous episodes,\nwe got to see how the Firesite and\n\n6\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.350\nour management center just can gather\na ton of data into its database and\n\n7\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.380\nit can make some really\nintelligent decisions on that.\n\n8\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.420\nWell, we don't necessarily want to be\nexposed to all that individual bits\n\n9\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.910\nof data, so fortunately it's got a very\npowerful reporting system inside of it.\n\n10\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.620\nIf we know the, questions to ask it,\n\n11\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.360\nit can actually give us\na lot of very valuable\n\n12\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.260\ndata in forms that's much more human\nreadable than looking at a raw database.\n\n13\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.790\nSo to walk us through\nthe reporting process,\n\n14\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.980\nwe've got Mr.Todd Lammle here\nin the studio with us and\n\n15\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.444\nhe's going to show us the ins and\nouts of the reporting magic.\n\n16\n00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:00.500\nAll right, let's go ahead and take a look\nat reports, and this is kind of important.\n\n17\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.610\nWe can schedule these and\nit gives us a lot of data,\n\n18\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.820\nand it actually make us look relatively\nsmart, and like we're doing a lot of work.\n\n19\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.980\nWe can make the system do the reports for\nus.\n\n20\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.950\nWe are just going to have to go in there\nare create something called a template.\n\n21\n00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.330\nThen we schedule it and it just runs.\n\n22\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710\nThe reports are done for us all the time,\nand we can have it done at anytime.\n\n23\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.920\nLet's go ahead and look at that,\nwe'll go ahead and create a template.\n\n24\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.540\nWe will generate the report,\nand then we'll schedule it.\n\n25\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.740\nSo I'm gonna go over to overview,\nreporting, and click on this.\n\n26\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.370\nAnd we're gonna see that\nwe have some reports.\n\n27\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.410\nAnd there's nothing in here right now.\n\n28\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.010\nBut we have some report templates.\n\n29\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.110\nBecause, when the reports are run,\nthey show up here.\n\n30\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.680\nThis is where you find them.\n\n31\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.900\nAnd then under report templates is where\nwe'll go to create the template for\n\n32\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.490\nthe report, that, when it runs,\nwhat are the parameters that it shows?\n\n33\n00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.040\nIn this case here, let's come down here\nand I could do, here's a FireSIGHT report,\n\n34\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.720\na malware report.\n\n35\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.730\nThese are built in from Cisco and\nwe love these.\n\n36\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.390\nThese are great.\n\n37\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.990\nWe're just gonna start with these\ninstead of having to build our own.\n\n38\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.550\nBecause we could say create report\ntemplate and start from the beginning.\n\n39\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.720\nIt takes a little effort to do this, so\n\n40\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.540\nwhy don't we use one that\nthey preconfigured and\n\n41\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.720\nthen just configure it for\nour particular network here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.220\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust edit this guy.\n\n43\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.870\nSo notice that I can export it,\nthat I can copy this.\n\n44\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.230\nSo I'm gonna say hey,\ntake this host report,\n\n45\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.460\nand I'm gonna leave this template alone.\n\n46\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.220\nAnd I'm gonna copy this and\nit's gonna create a new one and\n\n47\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.205\ngive me the same parameters within there,\nand I just have to update.\n\n48\n00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.109\nWe can see there is a parameter here.\n\n49\n00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.115\nSo in this case, I won't use this\nparticular report to schedule,\n\n50\n00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:30.094\nbecause what would happen, as soon as\nit runs ans says, enter the host IP.\n\n51\n00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:33.200\nI can also create user reports\nwhere is says, enter the username.\n\n52\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.465\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing to say,\n\n53\n00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:37.515\nhey, I'm seeing this user\ndoing a lot of stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.510\nLet's create a report on him.\n\n55\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.480\nDo a user report and\nput that in as a parameter and\n\n56\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.370\nthen type in John Smith or\nwhatever and it will come up and\n\n57\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.830\nshow me everything from the FireSIGHT\ndatabase that we know about this guy.\n\n58\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.360\nAll right,\nnow in this case here I'm gonna say,\n\n59\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.290\nTodd's host report of sales server,\nwhatever.\n\n60\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.900\nIt's a device with an IP address,\nand this is my input parameters.\n\n61\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.200\nNow the first thing I'm\ngonna do is come in here and\n\n62\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.350\nI'm gonna go to my advanced screen to make\nthis look even more professional, and\n\n63\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.130\nthat's what this is for,\ngive me some professionalism here.\n\n64\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.920\nGotta have that around here somewhere.\n\n65\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.530\nSomewhere.\n\n66\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.520\n[LAUGH] We gotta find\nthat professionalism.\n\n67\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.220\nI know it's in here somewhere..\n\n68\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.705\nInclude the cover page absolutely.\n\n69\n00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:20.505\nAnd then we got the design where it says,\nhey logo and report title is fine and\n\n70\n00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.405\nI want a table of contents and\nit will do that for me.\n\n71\n00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.295\nAnd then of course I want to\nput my company logo in there so\n\n72\n00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:29.285\nI look like a good company man.\n\n73\n00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.235\nI put my logo in there, so\nupload the logo in there.\n\n74\n00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:33.835\nAnd then I'm going to number them.\n\n75\n00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:34.565\nAnd then here's my input parameter.\n\n76\n00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:37.515\nNow if I was creating this by\nmyself I could say I'm going to\n\n77\n00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:41.990\ncreate an input parameter,\nnotice I could do things like Username.\n\n78\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.100\nAgain to go out and\n\n79\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.410\nfind a report on a particular user that's\nbeen getting on my nerves or whatever.\n\n80\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.640\nBy event, by device, by Network IP and\nthat's what this one is here.\n\n81\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.536\nSo, it said Network IP and then, so\n\n82\n00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:57.050\nit's gonna prompt me it says what's the\nIP Address that I wanna do a report on?\n\n83\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.810\nSo in this case here, I'm gonna say okay,\nwe got our professionalism here going on.\n\n84\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.510\nSo we got our introduction,\nwe got our advanced going on.\n\n85\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.080\nWe're going to come down here,\nand it actually told me some\n\n86\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.190\nof the parameters that were\nconfigured by default, applications,\n\n87\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.068\nintrusion events, connections,\nusers and white list violations.\n\n88\n00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:19.220\nAlright, so and a white list\nviolation we'll talk about tomorrow,\n\n89\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.420\nbut basically it's saying,\nhey we're on this network here,\n\n90\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.590\nyou can only run, I don't know, max with\nTCP/IP and you can only run Firefox.\n\n91\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.890\nYou can't even run Safari, whatever.\n\n92\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.896\nAnd if they do something that we tell them\nthey can't do, then they get a white list\n\n93\n00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:37.707\nviolation and we can punish the user then,\ncuz that's what we're into here.\n\n94\n00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:39.600\n[LAUGH] Just doling out punishment.\n\n95\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.441\nWho knew reporting could be so useful.\n\n96\n00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:43.610\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.542\nYes, cuz then tomorrow we're\ngoing to learn about punishment,\n\n98\n00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.850\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\nThat's another policies,\n\n99\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.740\nthat's a new policy we're going to create.\n\n100\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860\nSo when a user doesn't do what we tell\nhim to do, how do we punish them?\n\n101\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.570\nAll right, so we're going to look here and\nwe got our client applications and\n\n102\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.000\nI can just rename this right here and\n\n103\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.170\nsay I want this section title\nto be called something else.\n\n104\n00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.910\nOr when I create a template,\nthere's no name there so I put it there.\n\n105\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.030\nIn this case here, we'll just probably\nleave everything they had here.\n\n106\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.100\nBut notice this is connection events,\nand notice it's a bar graph.\n\n107\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.710\nAnd we can do table and\npie chart, and so on.\n\n108\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.830\nBut notice we need our x and y axis, xp up\nand then yp and y and something like that.\n\n109\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.620\nSo anyways,\nin this case here we have our x or y, but\n\n110\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.190\nthis one here's a table graph down here.\n\n111\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.650\nAnd what this allows me to do\nis create some different fields\n\n112\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.160\nthat I put in here for this table graph.\n\n113\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.140\nAnd I can sort these fields or\nI can add some fields.\n\n114\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.980\nAnd a lot of times I'll do\nsomething like application risk.\n\n115\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.347\nSo with the application risk we're\ngoing to go from high to low.\n\n116\n00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:49.725\nAnd if it's risk one from high to low.\n\n117\n00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.640\nIt'll give me the application risk, and\n\n118\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.160\nthat, we're gonna stick with this\nbusiness relevance right here, and\n\n119\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.610\nwe're gonna say the business\nrelevance is from low to high,\n\n120\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.990\nand from four, in other words,\nvery low business relevance but\n\n121\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.580\nhigh risk application, and\nI can say well I want these first.\n\n122\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.530\nSo I can just move these\naround most of the time.\n\n123\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.180\nMove this up here,\ncuz application risk and\n\n124\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.820\nbusiness relevance is\nvery important to me.\n\n125\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.965\nNotice I have impact,\nit didn't take but that's fine.\n\n126\n00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.490\n[LAUGH] This is one of those things\nthat's easier with a mouse than it is\n\n127\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.290\nwith a touchpad.\n\n128\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.920\nYeah, yeah yeah yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.380\nDragging is always\na nightmare on a touchpad.\n\n130\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.674\nThank you for sticking up for me buddy.\n\n131\n00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:34.393\n[LAUGH] I got your back.\n\n132\n00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.690\n[LAUGH] Impact the destinations.\n\n133\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.080\nSo, when we move these around.\n\n134\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.940\nGet them the way we want.\n\n135\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.880\nWe'll just say okay.\n\n136\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.770\nAnd then I'll say, hey,\nI think this is what this page,\n\n137\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.870\nI want it to look like because I got\na page break there, but I'm not real sure.\n\n138\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.980\nI won't be able to tell until I print it\nout and spend all that money on the color,\n\n139\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.020\nexpensive color printer.\n\n140\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.700\nBut I could preview this here.\n\n141\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.040\nSo, I can say,\nwhat does this look like right here,\n\n142\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.090\nI don't have any data because I don't\nhave the IP address in there yet.\n\n143\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.780\nAnd so it's gonna say,\n\n144\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.470\nwell once you put the IP address in there\nit'll probably look something like this.\n\n145\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.640\nHopefully it won't be empty but.\n\n146\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.280\nOkay so we can come through here and\nsay, intrusion events.\n\n147\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.559\nAnd that's when I change\nmy field sound here.\n\n148\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.740\nConnections, and users of this host, and\n\n149\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.990\nagain this is a bar chart and\nwe say users in count.\n\n150\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.240\nNotice it says top 25, and\n\n151\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.790\none of the things is I want\nthis one in blue, exactly.\n\n152\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.920\nBut hold on a second,\n\n153\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.110\nlet's go back up because all these\nsay inherit time window don't they?\n\n154\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:34.013\nAnd this is not a time based\nwindow in a [INAUDIBLE]\n\n155\n00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:35.210\nhere.\n\n156\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.900\nYou know, I'm still logged in as Todd and\nI escalated my permissions [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.190\n[LAUGH] That's awesome.\n\n158\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.185\nThat's why.\nI'm logged in as that loser.\n\n159\n00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:44.940\nAnyways.\n\n160\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.000\nFor those of you that watch\nthe users episode where\n\n161\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.600\nhe basically escalated his privileges so\nhe's sort of an admin right now.\n\n162\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.062\nYeah.\nBut sort of [CROSSTALK] Pretend admin.\n\n163\n00:07:54.062 --> 00:07:56.893\n[LAUGH] I'm a loser with admin privileges.\n\n164\n00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.900\nYeah.\nAll right that Todd guy.\n\n165\n00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.418\nI think it makes you a winner\n[CROSSTALK] security in.\n\n166\n00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:05.584\nSo this guy's on a time base, but\nnotice this one says in here time window.\n\n167\n00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:08.963\nWell there's something inherent from,\nso I'm going to change this one here and\n\n168\n00:08:08.963 --> 00:08:11.557\nsay, really, I'm going to run\nthis on this host once a week.\n\n169\n00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:15.623\nSo I'm going to come back here for the\nlast hour and I'm going to change that,\n\n170\n00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:18.390\nclick on that, and say,\nI want it for the last week.\n\n171\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.500\nAnd now everything else underneath,\nI will inherit it.\n\n172\n00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.560\nIn this case here I'm going to say,\ngive me the top 20 and that's fine,\n\n173\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.360\nthis is the bottom 100 and\nI don't really like that idea.\n\n174\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.360\nIntrusion of events from this host,\nthe bottom 100, really?\n\n175\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.020\nSo I'm going to change this to top ten or\nhow about twenty.\n\n176\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.530\nAnd we can preview this, but\nprobably not going to show us much\n\n177\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.130\nagain without the parameter, but it would\nlook something like this once we get that.\n\n178\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.820\nSo let's go ahead and try to put an IP\nout of fan and see how it goes this time.\n\n179\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.380\nRight?\n\n180\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.050\nSo we'll go ahead and go up here and\nI'll go through these fields,\n\n181\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.930\ncustomize them how I want.\n\n182\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.770\nRemember I took this existing template and\nsaved it, and it copied it, and\n\n183\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.100\nnow I'm saving it as something new, so\n\n184\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.700\nI didn't screw with the existing one,\nI'm just creating a new one.\n\n185\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.630\nSo if I kind of screw this up,\nthen I'm, then I can go back.\n\n186\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.160\nSo I'm gonna generate this, and\nnotice it says well wait a minute,\n\n187\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.180\nhold on, what's my IP address?\n\n188\n00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:13.090\nAnd say generate report, and\nnotice, I'm sorry, I did it in PDF.\n\n189\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.710\nI don't like the way the HTML reports come\nout at all, but you can do it and you can\n\n190\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.820\nalso do it in another way, but the fact\nis is also notice the relay host there.\n\n191\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.890\nNow it's already done.\n\n192\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.970\nBasically that relay host,\nremember we set that sys parameters,\n\n193\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.810\nit says email me when this report is done.\n\n194\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.530\nRight?\nNow,\n\n195\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.670\nwhen that's important is\nwhen I schedule this.\n\n196\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.290\nIt doesn't email me the report.\n\n197\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.170\nThat would be kind of cool,\n\n198\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.720\nthere's no, there's nothing that gives us\nthat capability and that would be nice.\n\n199\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.130\nIt emails and it tells me,\nhey it's in the overview reporting folder.\n\n200\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.185\nSo I'm gonna click on this and\nlet's see if we got some data.\n\n201\n00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:51.180\nAll right, we're efforting here,\nhere it is down here.\n\n202\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.550\nLet's see what happened here.\n\n203\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.520\nOkay.\nWow, well that looks pretty professional,\n\n204\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.630\nso far so good.\n\n205\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.930\nTodd's host report of sales server,\ntable of contents, we're looking good,\n\n206\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.086\nman I'm looking I'm telling my boss to\nlook at, I'm doing some work here, baby.\n\n207\n00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.420\n[LAUGH] Right?\nYou mentioned the boss,\n\n208\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.060\nthat's really where we'd use this if we\nhad a weekly status report or something.\n\n209\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.170\nThe boss doesn't wanna see your dashboard,\nyou have a ton of data.\n\n210\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.740\nThey wanna see this, bar graphs.\n\n211\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.890\nYeah lots of color, lots of graphs,\nlots of pictures, and the fact is that\n\n212\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.020\nthis one is kind of for me, because this\nis like what has this host been doing, and\n\n213\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.020\nthis is client application use by host,\nand this is giving me some information,\n\n214\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.810\nand here's some other connection\ndestined to this host so\n\n215\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.520\nwe're getting some\ninformation on this host.\n\n216\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.790\nRemember this was just a single host\n\n217\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.390\nwe really probably shouldn't see a lot\nof this server this was a client right?\n\n218\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.430\nI know what you're saying man that\nsounds great I love all this,\n\n219\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.810\nbut you know that seems\nlike an awful lot of work\n\n220\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.130\nright to go through here if I come in\nhere, and I go to report template and\n\n221\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.080\nI'm going to go create a new\ntemplate am I going to make it?\n\n222\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.180\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n223\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.690\nLet me show you.\n\n224\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.780\nWe can do that and\na highly recommend that you do do that.\n\n225\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.030\nBut let me show you something that if you\ngo through all that, you generate your\n\n226\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.730\ntemplate, you create your reports, you\nschedule them, and all that's great and\n\n227\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.420\ngood you look all great and\nfantastic in your weekly meetings.\n\n228\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.050\nbut let me show you something\na little bit easier.\n\n229\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.450\nSo I'm going to do the same thing go\nthrough all this hard work, and it's\n\n230\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.880\ngoing to come our with this awesome report\nthat looks like you worked forever on it.\n\n231\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.700\nBut you really didn't have to\ndo anything but push a button.\n\n232\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.130\nHow about that, you like this idea?\n\n233\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.540\nStick around here, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.560\nSo I'm going to go over here\nto overview dashboards.\n\n235\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.060\nAnd this is, as you remember, we've talked\nabout this many times, where we create our\n\n236\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.600\nwidgets based on our needs and this is\ncustomizable, unlike the Context Explorer.\n\n237\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.240\nSo notice that we're here.\n\n238\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.140\nAnd I could just do an intrusion advance.\n\n239\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.410\nIn this case I'm looking at the network.\n\n240\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.530\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna move these around.\n\n241\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.920\nI'm gonna add widgets, and\n\n242\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.140\nI'm gonna customize these\nwidgets based on what I need.\n\n243\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.190\nSo I'll spend some time on this one,\non this screen and I'll keep an eye on it.\n\n244\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.590\nA lot of my customers use this screen,\nagain like I said.\n\n245\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.740\nAnd they customize this.\n\n246\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.290\nAll right?\n\n247\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.410\nSo I say, okay, this is great.\n\n248\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.680\nYou know what I should do?\n\n249\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.050\nDon, I should go to my\nreport templates and\n\n250\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.780\nmake one from this screen with\nthese exact same headings.\n\n251\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.010\nSo I'm gonna write these all down and go\nover there and make different fields for\n\n252\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.530\nevery single one of these.\n\n253\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.932\nIf you're paid hourly that's a great plan.\n\n254\n00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:14.681\nI love it.\n\n255\n00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.530\nThat's exactly right.\n\n256\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.110\nOr if you're on salary and\nyou've worked here 80 hours that week,\n\n257\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.020\nI can just take that same thing, get this\nscreen going, come up here to something\n\n258\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.110\ncalled report designer and it says,\nI know what you want to do.\n\n259\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.190\nYou want all these fields in a template.\n\n260\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.470\nLet me do that for you.\n\n261\n00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.590\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on this and it says,\n\n262\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.000\nokay, let me create this template for you.\n\n263\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.800\nSo now we're going to see this awesome\nreport this template in here, and\n\n264\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.500\nI did do some work on the dashboard,\nin this case I didn't, but\n\n265\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.610\nI can come here and do this and\nshow the last day, that's fine.\n\n266\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.200\nAnd these are to show the last day,\nand that's fine,\n\n267\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.350\nbecause that's all I have in the date on\nthis, but I can make this a weekly report.\n\n268\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.430\nAnd I'm going to call this\nsummary dashboard right.\n\n269\n00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.710\nNow remember this is on our demo pod, and\nwe only have a couple hosts we haven't\n\n270\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.750\ndone a lot, so\nwe're not going to see a whole bunch.\n\n271\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.840\nBut if you have a larger network this\nthing will just gonna, right, and\n\n272\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.640\ngive you everything you need.\n\n273\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ngenerate this for fun.\n\n274\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.330\nAnd once I generate this,\n\n275\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.150\nso I'm doing html, I'm sorry pdf I can\nhave it relay me, email me when it's done.\n\n276\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.015\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say generate.\n\n277\n00:13:20.805 --> 00:13:23.855\nAnd this take a second because there's\na little bit more fields here than\n\n278\n00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:24.410\nmy last one.\n\n279\n00:13:28.222 --> 00:13:29.120\nOK, and that's already done.\n\n280\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.520\nTypically, might take a little bit longer,\ncuz we actually have a lot more data.\n\n281\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.930\nSo in this one here, it's not gonna\nbe as exciting as a real life,\n\n282\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.936\nbecause I don't have a lot of data\nin my defense center right now.\n\n283\n00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:42.271\nBut, nonetheless, this is still gonna be.\n\n284\n00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:43.556\nYou know what we didn't do?\n\n285\n00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.847\nI kind of screwed up because we\ndidn't do the professionalism.\n\n286\n00:13:46.847 --> 00:13:47.850\nWhere's my professional?\n\n287\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.130\nMy logo, mover cover page, my contents?\n\n288\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.910\nGotta have our flare.\n\n289\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.950\nThis would look great and\nthen you print this out in color and\n\n290\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.320\nhand it out to the board every\ntime you meet, on Friday or\n\n291\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.690\nMonday, or whenever it is, right?\n\n292\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.690\nSo now we got this,\nthis is a great report, and\n\n293\n00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.660\nwhen I do this on production networks,\nand I do do it this way,\n\n294\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.435\nthese reports are,\njust like jam packed with information.\n\n295\n00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:12.685\nAnd it really does give you a great\nover view right, and in this case here\n\n296\n00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:16.505\nsomeone's like okay I did this, and\nI'll go in and edit this template and\n\n297\n00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:19.143\nadd the professionalism to it right\nI can go ahead and easily do that.\n\n298\n00:14:19.143 --> 00:14:22.605\nSo I can come back here and say nance,\nand include the cover page,\n\n299\n00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:25.735\ninclude table of contents,\nchange my logo, number it.\n\n300\n00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:27.725\nNo input parameters because\nI want to schedule this,\n\n301\n00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:30.520\ncan't do input parameters\nif you want to do that.\n\n302\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.960\nThen I'll come back here and\nwe'll generate the report.\n\n303\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.660\nProbably give me some error because\nI already have one called that.\n\n304\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.910\nOkay, so this is part two.\n\n305\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.105\nThis is the professional report,\nit's the one that makes us look good.\n\n306\n00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:47.770\n[LAUGH] They do look really nice.\n\n307\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.110\nAnd part of it is Sysco knows that\nwhen you deploy this equipment and\n\n308\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.040\nyou deploy it right nobody\nknows it's running.\n\n309\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.830\nYou know.\n\n310\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.200\nIt's just kind of\ninvisible on the network.\n\n311\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.670\nSo when somebody's looking at that\nline item on their budget and\n\n312\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.460\nsaying, boy were paying a 1000\nbucks a year per device for\n\n313\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.270\nthis management and what's the value\nwe're getting out of that?\n\n314\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.635\nWell, at least we're getting\nsome really nice reports, right?\n\n315\n00:15:08.635 --> 00:15:11.250\n[LAUGH] Yes, we can generate some\nreally colorful graphs, right?\n\n316\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.620\nAnd it's all really great data depending\non how you set your templates.\n\n317\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.700\nIn this case here, go to the dashboard,\nconfigure it and go\n\n318\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.460\nto Intrusion Events on the dashboard and\nyou're gonna get all sorts of great data.\n\n319\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.090\nAll right, okay so\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n320\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.920\nNow we're much more professional.\n\n321\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.990\nWe look amazing.\n\n322\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.620\nRight?\n\n323\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.930\nSo we're putting this out and\n\n324\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.830\nagain, we only have a couple\nhosts on this network right.\n\n325\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.800\nAnd we're still getting\na great report here.\n\n326\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.840\nSo this is all great and good.\n\n327\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.930\nWe got this great report.\n\n328\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.030\nIt's full of data.\n\n329\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.310\nAnd we looking awesome.\n\n330\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.550\nWe got our professionals among there.\n\n331\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.955\nI just closed my html screen.\n\n332\n00:15:49.955 --> 00:15:51.910\n[LAUGH] I hit my http screen.\n\n333\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.450\nGive me one second here.\nWe don't need to break.\n\n334\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.879\nAnd what I want to do is then\nI come back in here, And\n\n335\n00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:01.566\nwe'll log in as admin this time,\nhow's that sound?\n\n336\n00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:05.550\nThat was pretty funny, actually.\n\n337\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.650\nAnd I'll come back in here and\nthat report's still there,\n\n338\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.470\nthe template's still there.\n\n339\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.110\nAnd so if we go to Overview Reporting,\nwe'll still see,\n\n340\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.620\nthere's my dashboard and all this.\n\n341\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.200\nBut I'll see my report here in Overview\nReporting so I can grab it from here.\n\n342\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.360\nSo here's my sales server 1 and\nmy summary dashboard 1 and 2, right?\n\n343\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.028\nNow okay.\nSo,\n\n344\n00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:26.857\nthese were created by a user Todd\nwho was escalated to awesomeness.\n\n345\n00:16:26.857 --> 00:16:32.065\nAnd now, I'm gonna come over here though\nand say, you know, I like that report.\n\n346\n00:16:32.065 --> 00:16:36.987\nI want that run, say, every Monday morning\nbefore my eight o'clock meeting that I\n\n347\n00:16:36.987 --> 00:16:38.930\nhave with you know whatever.\n\n348\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:44.000\nAnd so, I'm gonna come over here\nto System > Tools > Scheduling and\n\n349\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.400\nI am going to make your\nlife easier my friends.\n\n350\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.540\nI already made it easy by going to the\ndashboard by clicking that one button, and\n\n351\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.130\nit created this awesome template.\n\n352\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.380\nI just love that feature.\n\n353\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.941\nOkay, so I can say,\nI am going to add a task.\n\n354\n00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.842\nLet's take a look at all the different\ntasks that we can add other\n\n355\n00:16:58.842 --> 00:16:59.820\nthan the reporting.\n\n356\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.610\nThis is an important piece here.\n\n357\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.272\nSo I tell you what, when I go to my\ncustomer and I see that calendar there,\n\n358\n00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:08.992\nwhen I leave there that thing is just\njam packed with tasks that are going on\n\n359\n00:17:08.992 --> 00:17:10.149\nautomated every day.\n\n360\n00:17:10.149 --> 00:17:14.982\nAnd a lot of them are FireSIGHT updates,\nfor example.\n\n361\n00:17:14.982 --> 00:17:18.309\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that,\nso I can do a backup, so\n\n362\n00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:22.649\nI can schedule my backup of my defense\ncenter, once a month, something like that.\n\n363\n00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:24.090\nIt's not something that\nyou need to do a lot.\n\n364\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.280\nBut it is something that you should do.\n\n365\n00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.931\nNow remember when you get it\ndone it's gonna be backed up and\n\n366\n00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:30.691\nyou're going to see it in the back ups.\n\n367\n00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:34.691\nRename it to your software version, and\nyour fingerprint, your VDP database.\n\n368\n00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:38.890\nI mentioned that already, if you don't\ndo that you won't be able to restore it.\n\n369\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.490\nWell you would as long as\nyou remember what it is.\n\n370\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.070\nAnd it's so\nmuch easier if you rename it that, right?\n\n371\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.880\nAll right so back up.\n\n372\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.316\nWe can do NMAT scan.\n\n373\n00:17:45.316 --> 00:17:48.352\nSo, we can actually go out and schedule\nan NMAT scan to happen every Saturday,\n\n374\n00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:48.910\nfor example.\n\n375\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.411\nYou know,\n\n376\n00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:53.440\nwhere it's less intrusive because it's a\nvery active scan on all the hosts, right?\n\n377\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.065\nSo, we can go ahead and schedule this\nevery weekend or something like that.\n\n378\n00:17:56.065 --> 00:18:00.020\nAnd it'll take that information and\nput it in our FireSIGHT database.\n\n379\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.120\nOkay, over here we can do\nthe report which you're gonna do.\n\n380\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.990\nNotice I could say\nFireSIGHT Recommended Rules, so\n\n381\n00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.555\nI'm gonna go ahead and schedule this even\nthough we're doing a section on reporting.\n\n382\n00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:11.136\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna say\nI want this recurring,\n\n383\n00:18:11.136 --> 00:18:13.870\nI wanna update\nFireSIGHT Recommended Rules.\n\n384\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.100\nIt can't start today,\nwe're gonna start it tomorrow.\n\n385\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.361\nAnd I'm gonna say repeat every week, and\n\n386\n00:18:22.361 --> 00:18:27.475\nwe're gonna do it at\n11:30 PM every Friday,\n\n387\n00:18:27.475 --> 00:18:33.360\nwe're gonna update our\nFireSIGHT Recommended Rules.\n\n388\n00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.562\nThe job name is FireSIGHT update, got to\nname it, and then we're gonna say hey\n\n389\n00:18:37.562 --> 00:18:41.525\nwhich, you got a bunch of IPS policies\nout there, which ones do you want.\n\n390\n00:18:41.525 --> 00:18:44.857\nI am going to just say you know all\npolicies, so I could have just picked one,\n\n391\n00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:47.899\nbut in this case I'm going to say I\nwant them all updated, all right.\n\n392\n00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:51.033\nAnd now I'm going to email\nstatus of this job to,\n\n393\n00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:54.319\nand then you know my email\nrelay would be there, and\n\n394\n00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:58.316\nI'd be able to use that if I had\nsomething up in system policy.\n\n395\n00:18:58.316 --> 00:18:59.902\nSo I am going to go ahead and\nsave that and\n\n396\n00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:02.317\nthen I'm going to update my\nFireSIGHT recommended rules.\n\n397\n00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:05.187\nNow this did not save your IPS policy, and\n\n398\n00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:08.680\nit did not update\nthe access control policy.\n\n399\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.390\nBut, it did download and\nupdate the recommendations and\n\n400\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.070\nthen you'd have to do that one by hand.\n\n401\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.732\nBut, we can schedule that as well.\n\n402\n00:19:15.732 --> 00:19:17.910\nAll right, that being said,\nwe're gonna schedule this.\n\n403\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.274\nI'm gonna show you then,\nhow to implement it here in a second.\n\n404\n00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:22.390\nBut, let's go back to our reporting for\na second.\n\n405\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.316\nI didn't really get off.\n\n406\n00:19:24.316 --> 00:19:25.490\nSo I'm on my schedule here.\n\n407\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.090\nI'm gonna say add task.\n\n408\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:32.570\nAnd so we did the FireSIGHT and\nI need download latest update.\n\n409\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.860\nThat one's good too.\n\n410\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.610\nPush latest updates,\nupdate URL for filtering database.\n\n411\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.930\nI typically use most of these,\nand schedule them.\n\n412\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.630\nThat way I can't count on my\ncustomers to do this, I make sure and\n\n413\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.780\nschedule it for them.\n\n414\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.325\nAll right, so in this case here\nI'm also gonna schedule reports.\n\n415\n00:19:47.325 --> 00:19:49.320\n[LAUGH] In this case here,\nso I schedule reports so\n\n416\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.960\nthey see I've been doing something\nwhen I send them my invoice.\n\n417\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.580\nI'm gonna say look here's the report,\nright?\n\n418\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.870\nI'm gonna do this recurring.\n\n419\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:02.100\nAnd I can't start it today,\nhave to start it tomorrow and every week.\n\n420\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.364\nAnd I'm going to say at one no we\nwant it at 7:30 am every Monday\n\n421\n00:20:07.364 --> 00:20:13.232\nbecause I have a meeting at 8:00 or\n8:30 or something like that.\n\n422\n00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:20.024\nAnd then this is a weekly,\ndashboard report.\n\n423\n00:20:20.024 --> 00:20:24.150\nNow notice that the templates,\nthat the new templates that I created,\n\n424\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.173\none I went out to the dashboard,\nand I created that,\n\n425\n00:20:27.173 --> 00:20:30.590\nI created summary dashboard,\nand we see it listed here.\n\n426\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.750\nWe use one or two, I want two, that's\nthe one that gives us our professionalism,\n\n427\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.107\nbecause I the first one.\n\n428\n00:20:35.107 --> 00:20:38.023\nSo notice that when I did that, it\nactually created template, saved it, and\n\n429\n00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:39.170\nnow I can use them in my tasks.\n\n430\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.910\nThey were not here before, I created them.\n\n431\n00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.607\nSo you have to go out there, run the\nreport and now you'll have them in here.\n\n432\n00:20:44.607 --> 00:20:48.567\nOkay, then I'll go ahead and save this and\nwe'll see that's running every week.\n\n433\n00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.232\nAnd I do want to show you something\nelse that's very important.\n\n434\n00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:52.390\nSo notice I got some stuff here.\n\n435\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.720\nThis can get very busy.\n\n436\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.253\nSo I'm not done because I did my FireSIGHT\nupdates, but it didn't update my IPS\n\n437\n00:20:58.253 --> 00:21:03.274\npolicy and it didn't change my and\nit didn't update my access control policy.\n\n438\n00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:04.500\nSo it really hasn't done anything, right?\n\n439\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.730\nIt did update the FireSIGHT\nrecommendations but\n\n440\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.390\nI still have to go and\ndo it by hand, so let's fix that.\n\n441\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.936\nSo I'm gonna come out here to Updates,\nso I'm gonna say System > Updates now.\n\n442\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.410\nAnd this is where I schedule these.\n\n443\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.740\nSo I come up here and say Rule Updates.\n\n444\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.800\nAnd I can do geolocation.\n\n445\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.085\nIf you use geolocation, and let's say\nyou were blocking the Africa and India,\n\n446\n00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:25.319\nthe things that we talked about and\nwe want to update those every week, right,\n\n447\n00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.190\nall the time, geolocation updates,\nso you go in there and do those.\n\n448\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.140\nBut check this out.\n\n449\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.090\nSo I'm gonna say reoccurring rule updates,\nright?\n\n450\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.459\nSo I am going to click this.\n\n451\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.170\nAnd notice what it says here.\n\n452\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.147\nSo notice that I did my FireSIGHT first\nand now I'm coming here, well okay, so\n\n453\n00:21:41.147 --> 00:21:44.100\nmy FireSIGHT is updated but\nmy IPS policy is not updated and\n\n454\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.232\nmy access control policy is not updated.\n\n455\n00:21:46.232 --> 00:21:49.145\nSo I really haven't accomplished much but\nin this case here,\n\n456\n00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:50.384\nI'm gonna say not daily.\n\n457\n00:21:50.384 --> 00:21:53.690\nI'm gonna say weekly.\n\n458\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.592\nOn Saturday.\n\n459\n00:21:55.592 --> 00:22:00.850\nNotice, remember we did our FireSIGHT\nFriday night, so on Saturday at 8 AM.\n\n460\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:06.720\nI'm going to enable my rule,\nmy Snort rule's my fingerprints,\n\n461\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.690\nand I'm gonna get my new rules, and\nthat's gonna update my IPS policy.\n\n462\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.580\nSo I'm gonna say, well reapply that.\n\n463\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.024\nSo now remember I just did my FireSIGHT,\nso now that's gonna be applied as well.\n\n464\n00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:21.446\nThen I'm gonna say, and\nat eight o'clock on Saturday,\n\n465\n00:22:21.446 --> 00:22:23.670\nwe apply the access control policy.\n\n466\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:24.770\nNow maybe you wanna do this,\n\n467\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:30.290\nmaybe people work on Saturday that are at\nthis office and you wanna do it at six.\n\n468\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.220\nSo now we know it's done, your network, if\nyou're not allowing traffic while you're\n\n469\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.280\nupdating your access control policy,\nit could be down for a couple of minutes.\n\n470\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.890\nBut at 6 AM on Saturday morning.\n\n471\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.360\nOkay, so, not saying you can do this, I'm\njust showing you how to do it if you can.\n\n472\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.220\nAnd in this case here I have\nalready done my FireSIGHT updates,\n\n473\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.050\nnow I'm doing my rule updates, updating my\nIPS policy and my access control policy.\n\n474\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.774\nBadabing, badaboom, we're looking good.\n\n475\n00:22:53.774 --> 00:22:56.302\nInvalid minute, for\ncrying out loud, really?\n\n476\n00:22:56.302 --> 00:22:59.410\n[LAUGH] Gosh, I was like badabing,\nbadaboom and there we go,\n\n477\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.608\nlet's try this again.\n\n478\n00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:05.066\nAnd it's 6 AM and let's do this.\n\n479\n00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:10.607\nAnd I guess we'll choose\n[INAUDIBLE] 6 AM and then reapply.\n\n480\n00:23:10.607 --> 00:23:14.412\nSo we'll try that again and bada-bing,\nbada-boom, gonna get our FireSIGHT\n\n481\n00:23:14.412 --> 00:23:17.419\nupdates, we get our rule updates,\nwe reapply our IPS policy,\n\n482\n00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:21.790\naccess control policy, and\nwe're looking good every week, my friends.\n\n483\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.298\nAnd not only that,\nevery Monday morning when we come in this,\n\n484\n00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:29.480\nnot only has this been done and we can\ncheck on that status, we have a report\n\n485\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.357\nsiting in our overview reports inbox,\nin basket, whatever, and we're good to go.\n\n486\n00:23:34.357 --> 00:23:37.165\nWe can print it out,\nemail it to our friends, our bosses, and\n\n487\n00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:38.524\nwe're looking good, guys.\n\n488\n00:23:38.524 --> 00:23:42.482\nYeah and it's pretty handy especially\nif you have a large database, right?\n\n489\n00:23:42.482 --> 00:23:44.078\nI mean if this thing has been running for\nmonths and\n\n490\n00:23:44.078 --> 00:23:46.322\nyou've got tens of thousands of\nmachines behind it can take a while for\n\n491\n00:23:46.322 --> 00:23:47.858\nthose reports to generate sometimes,\nright?\n\n492\n00:23:47.858 --> 00:23:49.482\nIt can.\n\n493\n00:23:49.482 --> 00:23:53.240\nThe dashboard you guys are looking\nat we have just a few host on there.\n\n494\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.690\nYou're right if you have tens of thousands\nof different hosts which is very possible.\n\n495\n00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.566\nThat could be a very big report,\nmy friends.\n\n496\n00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:02.607\nSo having that report waiting for us\nwhen we come in is kind of a nice thing.\n\n497\n00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:05.167\nNow we're not having to sit there having\nto run it and wait and wait and wait,\n\n498\n00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:05.820\nit's just there.\n\n499\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.124\nYou fire it up, you go to your meeting,\nyou impress the people,\n\n500\n00:24:08.124 --> 00:24:08.990\nyou get the promotion.\n\n501\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.357\nIt's a happy story, right?\n\n502\n00:24:10.357 --> 00:24:11.280\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n503\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.553\nAs a contractor now,\n\n504\n00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:16.817\nyou have that report, then their\ninvoice prints out right after that.\n\n505\n00:24:16.817 --> 00:24:17.607\nAnd you're good to go, guys.\n\n506\n00:24:17.607 --> 00:24:18.773\n[LAUGH] Don't forget the invoice.\n\n507\n00:24:18.773 --> 00:24:20.607\nThe invoice.\nThat's very important, my friends.\n\n508\n00:24:20.607 --> 00:24:24.214\nAll right, Todd, that's a pretty\nexhaustive rundown of the reporting\n\n509\n00:24:24.214 --> 00:24:28.100\nfeatures inside of, well, the management\ncenter in FirePower in general.\n\n510\n00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.340\nA lot of really good stuff, there.\n\n511\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.942\nDid you have anything else you wanted\nto throw in here before we wrap up?\n\n512\n00:24:31.942 --> 00:24:33.190\nNo, I think we did great.\n\n513\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.900\nWe have this phenomenal report\nbecause we typically would go out and\n\n514\n00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.180\ncreate this great dashboard the way we\nwant it with our custom widgets and\n\n515\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.390\neverything, made a report template out of\nit and created the professionalism, right?\n\n516\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.770\nWe hit that advance cap.\n\n517\n00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.170\nAnd that's running at 7:30 every morning.\n\n518\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.940\nBut the other thing is is on Friday night\nwe did our FireSIGHT recommended updates.\n\n519\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.450\nOn Saturday morning we applied them and\ndownloaded the new rules and\n\n520\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.220\nthen reapplied our APS policy which\nreapplied the recommended rules,\n\n521\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.670\nand then we had reapplied\nour access control policy.\n\n522\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.210\nThe other thing that you could do is\nthe same thing we did with the updates.\n\n523\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.630\nIs go into geolocation\nif you're using that.\n\n524\n00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.390\nNow that one takes a while so you want to\nschedule about 45 minutes or an hour for\n\n525\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.920\nthat update to come down.\n\n526\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.630\nBut you can do it the same way\nwe did the other rule updates.\n\n527\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:16.870\nGo and schedule that and\n\n528\n00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.480\njust do it, make sure you do it an hour\nbefore you apply your other policies.\n\n529\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.500\nAll right.\nWell,\n\n530\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.130\nwe got a chance to see the reporting side.\n\n531\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.250\nWe saw the scheduling side.\n\n532\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.920\nWe saw, well, reporting and scheduling\nput together like peanut butter and\n\n533\n00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.090\nchocolate, it was amazing.\n\n534\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.250\nBut that is a good spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n535\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:36.649\nKeep in mind, we've got a lot more\nCisco FirePower content coming up.\n\n536\n00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:38.691\nYou don't want to change that channel.\n\n537\n00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:41.982\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I am Don Pezet.\n\n538\n00:25:41.982 --> 00:25:43.316\nTodd Langley.\n\n539\n00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:45.441\nAnd we will see you next

00:00:19.380\nWelcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Don Pizet.\n\n4\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.190\nBack again with another\nepisode of Cisco FirePower.\n\n5\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.970\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nmoving into the wonderful world of\n\n6\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.760\nevent analysis.\n\n7\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.970\nWe've seen events numerous\ntimes throughout this show and\n\n8\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.990\nthe reports that we can build around it.\n\n9\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.130\nBut, we need to be able to get a deeper\ndive into those events to determine\n\n10\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.530\nwhether or not it's good traffic,\nbad traffic, unhappy or\n\n11\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.600\nhappy traffic, or\nwhatever it is we need to do.\n\n12\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.777\nAnd that's what we're going to take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:46.190\nAnd here to help as always,\nMr. Todd Lammle.\n\n14\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.370\n>> As always.\n>> Todd, let's take a look at some events.\n\n15\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.340\n>> Yeah, and guys you're going to find\nout that this is the most important\n\n16\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.440\nthing you'll do for your day.\n\n17\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.170\nAfter you have that most important meal\nof the day, you're going to get up and\n\n18\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.730\ntake a look at your event analysis.\n\n19\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.590\nThis is kind of what I do a lot once\nyou get everything up and running.\n\n20\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.450\nRemember, let's go recap\na little bit of what we've done.\n\n21\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.630\nWe created some policies.\n\n22\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.290\nWe started with our file policy.\n\n23\n00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.640\nWe went into our IPS policy.\n\n24\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.660\nWe applied those with\nan access control policy.\n\n25\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.870\nOkay, life is good.\n\n26\n00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.960\nBut wait, we needed more.\n\n27\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.330\nWe wanted some fireside data, so\nwe went to network discovery policy and\n\n28\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.170\nconfigured that, and\nget our users, got our.\n\n29\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.620\nL DAP working, our source fire user agent,\nso we can get fire site data.\n\n30\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.100\nAnd we looked at some of\nthose connection events,\n\n31\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.880\nand let's take a deeper dive into some of\nthis network analysis both on the fact of\n\n32\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.230\nwhat atrusion gives us, our file policy\ngives us, our intrusion gives us,\n\n33\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.560\nour access control policy gives and\nour fire site.\n\n34\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.070\nLet's take it a little deeper dive so\n\n35\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.240\nlet's go ahead and\ntake a look at that on my screen.\n\n36\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.750\nOkay in this case here I've got,\n\n37\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.090\nfirst thing I always start with\nanalysis connection events.\n\n38\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.410\nActually that's not the first\nthing I always start with.\n\n39\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.870\nSo, you know, I get up in the morning and\nI have this on.\n\n40\n00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.250\nI'll get logged in to my customers and\nI'll log in to contacts explorer here.\n\n41\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940\nIn this case here I'm not seeing\nany data because I'm not, I'm only,\n\n42\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.920\nI'm not looking back.\n\n43\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.870\nSo notice I have some\nindication of the compromises,\n\n44\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.990\nsomething I need to look at right away.\n\n45\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.550\nI want this as zero but it's not but\nalso I want to come back and say,\n\n46\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.970\ngive me the last 6 hours or\nthe last day or the last 24 hours or\n\n47\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.800\nsomething since the last\ntime I looked at it.\n\n48\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.830\nRight, and see what we get.\n\n49\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.240\nIn this case here,\nI'm not seeing anything.\n\n50\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.460\nWe'll go back to the last 24 hours since\nthe last time I worked on this and\n\n51\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.270\nnotice I'm going to get\na little traffic here, and\n\n52\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.400\nit's going to tell me\nwhen I had an issue here.\n\n53\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.920\nSo you can see that it was sometime\nlast night that I did this.\n\n54\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.400\nAnyways, so come down here and\nlet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n55\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.430\nWe want to go into connection events and\nfile events for sure.\n\n56\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.490\nAnd we're gonna hit there,\nso just bear with me.\n\n57\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.170\nThis is the screen where\nyou guys are gonna go.\n\n58\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.150\nFirst off, you can see our\nindications are compromised.\n\n59\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.680\nSo what I'm gonna do is this is an impact\none so we're like this is bad, right.\n\n60\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.410\nWell first off, what does that mean?\n\n61\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.880\nWhat's impact one and impact two and so\non, and we're gonna dig deeper into those.\n\n62\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.620\nBut hold on, I'm stuck on this page,\nI don't know what this means.\n\n63\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.330\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nhit Help and\n\n64\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.160\nit's gonna take me to this online here.\n\n65\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.390\nAnd I'm just gonna hit Help and\n\n66\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.560\nit's gonna give me help on\nwhere I'm looking at right now.\n\n67\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.040\nThis is a very great screen here.\n\n68\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.045\nNotice we have support site,\nemail support.\n\n69\n00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:05.760\n[COUGH] But In this case here we're\ngonna say, the help screen and\n\n70\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.940\nit says, I'm on Content Explorer.\n\n71\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.490\nWell how do you use\nthe the Content Explorer?\n\n72\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.760\nThat's not too hard.\n\n73\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.470\nBut I'm gonna come over here and\n\n74\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.950\nclick this little table thing\nover here and then click search.\n\n75\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.170\nAnd there's so\nmuch information here, my friends.\n\n76\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.700\nImpact, so I'm gonna say,\nI want Impact Events.\n\n77\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.510\nAnd I can see I already looked for\nthat at one time.\n\n78\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.390\nSo here's my impact events.\n\n79\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.850\nAnd it's usually impact levels,\nright here.\n\n80\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.100\nSo I clicked on this, and it says, using\nthe impact levels to evaluate events.\n\n81\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.540\nAnd you can read this.\n\n82\n00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.340\nNotice that 0 is unknown.\n\n83\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.260\nIt doesn't know the host or destination.\n\n84\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.840\nBut one, hey, that's bad.\n\n85\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.330\nIt's vulnerable to red.\n\n86\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.790\nAll right, it's gotta be bad.\n\n87\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.290\nSo it's either the source or the\ndestination host is in the network map.\n\n88\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.130\nSo in other words, we've seen it\nin the fire side data base, and\n\n89\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.370\nit's been attacked, so we know who it is.\n\n90\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.790\nWe know where it either came from or where\nit's going, but this is probably a virus\n\n91\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.180\ntrojan or some other malicious sort of\nmalware or ransomware or something, right.\n\n92\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.980\nPotentially vulnerable Is orange so we're\nmostly concerned about our level 1's and\n\n93\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.620\nlevel 2.\n\n94\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.920\nImpact one and impact two's,\n\n95\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.580\nthe other ones maybe something that\nwe look at when we get a chance.\n\n96\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.590\nBut when I come back over here and\nI'm on my contacts explorer, and\n\n97\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.420\nI see something like this.\n\n98\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.440\nHere's a threat detected, this is two\nhost, that's malware right there baby.\n\n99\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.020\nSo this is what we were definitely\ngoing to drill into that.\n\n100\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.510\nAnd we'll come back to this one.\n\n101\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.800\nBut let's see this one.\n\n102\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.250\nHere's an intrusion admin attempt.\n\n103\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.630\nSo someone tried to log in as admin.\n\n104\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.220\nNow who would that be?\n\n105\n00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.360\nSome guy that was up to no\ngood shenanigans right?\n\n106\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.481\n>> Somebody's name that starts with T and\nends with D.\n\n107\n00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:40.760\n>> [LAUGH] Who escalated his permissions\nearlier and now he's a badass right?\n\n108\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.484\nSo it's like.\n\n109\n00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.700\nAnyway.\nSo we're going to drill into analysis,\n\n110\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.270\nand we can see that we have\ntwo hair impact one attacks.\n\n111\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.820\nNow here's some of\nthe things that I can do.\n\n112\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.800\nI can come over here and see this URL bar\nand I can click on these one at a time.\n\n113\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.720\nNow I can click on this.\n\n114\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.470\nIf I had many of these I click on\nthese squares here and choose it,\n\n115\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.890\nbut in this case here I only have the one.\n\n116\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.640\nNotice this though,\nI can click on this says I went out there,\n\n117\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.650\nI found out it was a host,\n\n118\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.250\nI sent the out there to somebody out\nthere to fix the host if it was attacked.\n\n119\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.860\nAnd notice this,\nI'm gonna mark this resolved.\n\n120\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.940\nSo really my reality every\nmorning is going there and\n\n121\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.860\nresolving those issues, finding what\nthey are by changing the events and\n\n122\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.248\nso on, the rules, suppressing them or\nthresholding them or disabling them.\n\n123\n00:05:30.248 --> 00:05:31.980\nA little tongue-tied right there, right.\n\n124\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.331\nBut I'm gonna go all the way down to here,\nto the end to the host right here.\n\n125\n00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:38.800\nAnd I'm gonna click on that,\nit's gonna take me to the host.\n\n126\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.940\nAnd now we're gonna get some,\nnow this is the,\n\n127\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.695\nit took me to the indication\nof compromise.\n\n128\n00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:47.210\nSo this was an impact WAN attack on\na host, it tells me I have an impact.\n\n129\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.850\nAnd now notice that when I get a fix\nI can mark it resolved from here,\n\n130\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.780\nI can view operating systems, edit them,\nand tell us what it is, I'm not seeing\n\n131\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.150\nthe users on here because I didn't log in,\nlog out on this network, did I?\n\n132\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.480\nSo Anyways, I don't have a lot\nof events on this one network.\n\n133\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.680\nBut we can take a look at a couple things.\n\n134\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.370\nSo we get our host protocols and\nnotice the vulnerabilities here.\n\n135\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.910\nAnd this is kind of more something I would\nsee every day, like these real events,\n\n136\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.460\nthese vulnerabilities in something like\nthis where they're not just one after\n\n137\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.570\nanother like when we went to that\ndemo pod, something like that.\n\n138\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.060\nSo this a way to look at this.\n\n139\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.740\nSo we're gonna come in here,\nfind out what's wrong.\n\n140\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.880\nGo to this host, find out who it is.\nWe'll see [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n141\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.070\nits current user based on its\nactive directory information.\n\n142\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.910\nBut the host was attacked.\n\n143\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.880\nWe've got to go out and look at that host,\nand then mark that as resolved.\n\n144\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.790\nSo come back here to context explorer.\n\n145\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.480\nAnd now we can look at this malware event.\n\n146\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.120\nBut we'll come back to that,\nwe'll look at it in a different direction.\n\n147\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.670\nI can certainly do it from here.\n\n148\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.730\nBut in here,\nhere's my top attack toast here,\n\n149\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.240\nthat'd be the top 15 listed\nhere if I had a bunch.\n\n150\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.670\nAnd I can get some information.\n\n151\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.010\nNotice that I can blacklist this now.\n\n152\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.090\nI can whitelist it.\n\n153\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.790\nThis is not a problem.\n\n154\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.190\nLet's fix this right\nnow with the whitelist.\n\n155\n00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.820\nView host information, drill into\nanalysis, so I can get more information,\n\n156\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.450\nand add an exclude filter so\nI can filter it out and so on.\n\n157\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.580\nSo, this is a really great screen\nin talking to me about Hosts.\n\n158\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.230\nThen I have a problem that I\nneed to look at right away.\n\n159\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.010\nNow I need my network information, notice\nthat I see my different operating systems.\n\n160\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.420\nThis isn't telling me it's a problem.\n\n161\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.680\nThis is just showing me what I see on\nmy network, and these are all fine.\n\n162\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.130\nAnd this is saying, this host right here,\nand this host right,\n\n163\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.790\nthere was 272 connections.\n\n164\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.100\nThere's a lot of traffic.\n\n165\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.060\nSo, now I'm looking at How much traffic\nand which one's top talk or host.\n\n166\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.950\nWe got to make sure these\nhosts should be doing that,\n\n167\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.860\nthat why is this host sending so\nmuch data that anyone else?\n\n168\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.630\nMaybe it's got something on there that's\nsending out you know if it's got mail\n\n169\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.100\nwhere its sending out information.\n\n170\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.845\nSo were going to keep an eye on that.\n\n171\n00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.655\nBut this is basically just\ngiving me some information.\n\n172\n00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:49.095\nNow connection information by intrusion,\nby block.\n\n173\n00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:51.515\nSo this was blocked, and this was allowed.\n\n174\n00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:53.995\nSo this isn't really\nnecessarily a bad network.\n\n175\n00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:56.805\nThis is something I would see, and\nthis doesn't even mean this is a problem.\n\n176\n00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:58.030\nThis could be a false positive here.\n\n177\n00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.067\nWe're gonna go and take a look at that,\nand find out what's causing this.\n\n178\n00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:02.327\nAnd why it's being blocked.\n\n179\n00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:05.861\nAnd if it's true, then I'm just gonna\nblack list that host that was causing,\n\n180\n00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:07.414\nbecause if it's a true problem and\n\n181\n00:08:07.414 --> 00:08:10.560\nhe's being blocked I don't even\nwant him coming in at all, right.\n\n182\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.560\nSo I wanna keep resolving, keep working\non getting all of this resolved.\n\n183\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.880\nNow again I can show you a network\nthat has a lot more attacks on it,\n\n184\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.080\nit's just really not as relevant as this.\n\n185\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.840\nI know that sounds ridiculous but\n\n186\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.470\nit's true, because this is more of\na real life network here, right?\n\n187\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.891\nIt might be a little bit more than this,\nbut\n\n188\n00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:30.869\nnot a lot more depending on\nhow many hosts there are.\n\n189\n00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:34.005\nSee if I can go down\na little bit slower here.\n\n190\n00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:34.851\nOkay.\n\n191\n00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:36.641\nSSL information, and,\n\n192\n00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:41.679\nnow the application protocols stuff\nI actually spend some time here.\n\n193\n00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.560\nI know this sounds really weird because\nyou're like it's applications who cares?\n\n194\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.730\nWell I'll tell you the customer cares.\n\n195\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.040\nSo I will come over here and\n\n196\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.280\nsay show me the web applications that\nthe users in that network are using.\n\n197\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.700\nOkay, this is going to show\nme my web applications, and\n\n198\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.862\nit shows me host by risk and\napplication here.\n\n199\n00:08:57.862 --> 00:09:00.480\nAll right.\nIt's kind of hard to get this perfect.\n\n200\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.235\nHost by risk and application,\nnow here's the deal.\n\n201\n00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:06.150\nSo check this out, I'm going to come\nup here and do a filter because\n\n202\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.470\nI'm looking at the web and I'm seeing,\nhere's Mozilla, Adobe software.\n\n203\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.540\nActually, none of these really\nlook all that bad, do they?\n\n204\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.150\nAnd the fact is, they don't because I\ndidn't really do a lot on this network.\n\n205\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.720\nIn real life, we're going to see\na little bit more data here.\n\n206\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.275\nBut one of the things that I\nwant you to do is come in here,\n\n207\n00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:25.546\nwe're gonna apply a filter here and\n\n208\n00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:29.651\nI want you to say if it has application\nrisk is high and very high.\n\n209\n00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:32.530\nAnd this is something that you\nwant FireSIGHT to tell you about.\n\n210\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.810\nIf we're seeing applications, we think\nare high risk, okay, not only that though,\n\n211\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.000\nwhat else do I usually add?\n\n212\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.860\nThe business relevance.\n\n213\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.534\nOkay, so I'm gonna come in here and\nsay, and\n\n214\n00:09:42.534 --> 00:09:46.131\nthe business relevance is low and\nvery low.\n\n215\n00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:48.489\nSay OK and then Apply.\n\n216\n00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:50.404\nNow, I might not see something here, but\n\n217\n00:09:50.404 --> 00:09:53.305\nthis would give me something if\nsomeone had gone to show me hey,\n\n218\n00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:56.397\nevery one spent a lot of time on YouTube,\na lot of time on Facebook.\n\n219\n00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:58.899\nWhy do I get this information and\ngive it to my customers?\n\n220\n00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.842\nBecause, I'm not seeing any data here,\nwhy,\n\n221\n00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:04.460\nbecause I didn't just go out there and\nsearch the web and all of that.\n\n222\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.661\nBut if I was a new customer, I want you to\ngo and do this because then you can take\n\n223\n00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:11.010\nit to your boss or your customer and say,\nhey, this is what your users are doing,\n\n224\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.504\nyou might wanna create your\nsecurity policy based on this.\n\n225\n00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:17.100\nAnd maybe you don't want them to spend so\nmuch time at social media or\n\n226\n00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.880\ndating sites or gambling sites.\n\n227\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.666\nAnd these are the typical things\nI do see at customers, all right?\n\n228\n00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:26.231\nI know everyone's always working\nwhen you walk by, but I promise you,\n\n229\n00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:27.612\n[LAUGH] they're not.\n\n230\n00:10:27.612 --> 00:10:30.225\n[LAUGH] I can promise you that.\n\n231\n00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:33.100\nI just see way too much data that gives\nme the opposite information of that.\n\n232\n00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.070\nAnd this will prove it right there.\n\n233\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.590\nAnd, not only that, we can put it in\na report and make it look all pretty.\n\n234\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.056\nBut, nonetheless, go there and\ndo that business, low business relevance,\n\n235\n00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:43.752\nhigh risk.\n\n236\n00:10:43.752 --> 00:10:47.130\nAnd then let them make\na decision what you wanna do.\n\n237\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.707\nAnd that's easy to go in our\naccess control policy and\n\n238\n00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:51.087\nmake that policy a reality.\n\n239\n00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:54.318\nOkay, and then we got our security\nintelligence, our white and black list,\n\n240\n00:10:54.318 --> 00:10:55.780\nintrusion information.\n\n241\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.310\nAnd again, now we're gonna come down here,\nand we're seeing this, and going,\n\n242\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.640\nokay, this isn't good, and I can easily\nagain from here draw an analysis.\n\n243\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.650\nFind out hey, what's going on here?\n\n244\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.290\nImpact three is, hey,\n\n245\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.300\ntake a look at it when you get a chance,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n246\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.670\nBut we can go and find out what it is.\n\n247\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.893\nThis guy right here, the red's gonna\nbe Malware, but I can go ahead and\n\n248\n00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:17.064\ndrill into it but\nI'm gonna do that in a second.\n\n249\n00:11:17.064 --> 00:11:20.345\nNow the file information\nisn't necessarily bad, but\n\n250\n00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:22.660\nthis is telling me what's been sent.\n\n251\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:28.045\nWe can see that this file,\nthis was an executable,\n\n252\n00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:33.549\nand this was a ZIP file and\nit came across as Malware, right?\n\n253\n00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:36.270\nAnd so, we see something like this,\nwe're gonna trace it down and\n\n254\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.494\nfigure out what it really is and then\nwe're gonna go ahead and block that file.\n\n255\n00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:41.699\nWe can add it to a wider black list.\n\n256\n00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:44.012\nNow, I don't see a lot right here, but\n\n257\n00:11:44.012 --> 00:11:48.190\nmost of the stuff I was doing here\nin the hotel here in Florida,right?\n\n258\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.830\nBut I was finding that place with Malware\nout in Germany so I was playing with them\n\n259\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.208\na little bit so you can see that I got\nsome events from Germany to me, right.\n\n260\n00:11:57.208 --> 00:12:04.406\nSo we don't want to see a whole bunch here\nso if I was to open up different one here.\n\n261\n00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:05.370\nLemme see if this guy does it.\n\n262\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.251\nNo he doesn't.\n\n263\n00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:09.772\nBut if I was to open up one that\nhad a lot more events and so on,\n\n264\n00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:12.610\nwe'd see a lot more countries and\nso on in here.\n\n265\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.140\nBut in this case here,\nI can say what's going on in Germany.\n\n266\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.180\nIn this case, remember we went into our\naccess control policy we went out and\n\n267\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.690\nblocked Germany.\n\n268\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.690\nNow, that might be a little\nextreme to block that whole\n\n269\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.110\ncountry because of that one site.\n\n270\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.135\nSo you might want to remember that.\n\n271\n00:12:24.135 --> 00:12:26.260\nWe can just blacklist that one site,\nfor sure.\n\n272\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.361\nOkay, there's some great information here.\n\n273\n00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:30.032\nI spend a lot of time here.\n\n274\n00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:34.544\nAnd we can get a lot of information,\nand make some adjustments and\n\n275\n00:12:34.544 --> 00:12:36.440\ndrill down into analysis.\n\n276\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.914\nBut let's take a look at some other stuff.\n\n277\n00:12:37.914 --> 00:12:41.890\nSo let's go ahead start\nwith connection events.\n\n278\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.110\nAnd we'll go to intrusion events and\nfile events.\n\n279\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.340\nBasically, the opposite way that\nwe did our policies, right?\n\n280\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.790\nSo, you wanna come here and\nwe can see these the IoCs.\n\n281\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.469\nOkay, so, we already kind of talked about\nthis screen and we see in this case here,\n\n282\n00:12:53.469 --> 00:12:55.376\nwe got a lot of indications of compromise.\n\n283\n00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:55.910\nWhy?\n\n284\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.380\nBecause I was absolutely doing attack.\n\n285\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.240\nSo, in this case here,\nit's all the same hosts.\n\n286\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.010\nWe're gonna see that\nthere's a problem here.\n\n287\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.340\nSo once we get that fixed, if you wanted\nto, you could click on all of them and\n\n288\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.690\nthen say delete or delete all.\n\n289\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.252\nNow remember if you delete these,\nthey're gone forever, right?\n\n290\n00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:16.130\nSo they're not just gone from the screen,\nthey're gone from the data base.\n\n291\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.150\nSo if you want to do that,\nthat's fine, just understand that.\n\n292\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.350\nAnd the reason it would do that is you've\ngot millions events from this host.\n\n293\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.540\nYou want to clear that out and\nstart over again.\n\n294\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.320\nMy buffers are full.\n\n295\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.283\nI want to make sure I'm not\nseeing anything from the old.\n\n296\n00:13:28.283 --> 00:13:30.500\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at intrusion events.\n\n297\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:37.270\nAnd I'm gonna get events here\nbecause based on my IPS policy.\n\n298\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.580\nAnd notice here, this is my source IP.\n\n299\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.887\nAt this point I'm looking at this\nguy here and he's got a problem, but\n\n300\n00:13:43.887 --> 00:13:48.705\nthis is my source IP, the inlying result\nis dropped based on my IPS policy, and\n\n301\n00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:50.835\nthat's what this is saying here.\n\n302\n00:13:50.835 --> 00:13:54.196\nHere's my impact, I have a one,\ntwo, three, [LAUGH] and\n\n303\n00:13:54.196 --> 00:13:58.746\nthis guy showed up twice here as a impact\ntwo, and as an impact three here, but\n\n304\n00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:02.200\nregardless we can click on this and\nget more information.\n\n305\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.840\nNow again,\nif I click on this URL it's gonna just\n\n306\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.300\ntake me to all the events that\nhappened for this guy here.\n\n307\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.648\nBut lets go down here, and I can drill\ndown here and go across this URL or\n\n308\n00:14:11.648 --> 00:14:12.922\nclick on this here.\n\n309\n00:14:12.922 --> 00:14:14.419\nNow notice some of the things I can do.\n\n310\n00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:17.550\nI can click on this guy and say this\nimpact one I want more information.\n\n311\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.320\nI can download the packets now.\n\n312\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.020\nI can review them.\n\n313\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.520\nI can delete them or copy them.\n\n314\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.450\nNow one of the things,\nI can download all of these packets.\n\n315\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.270\nAnd what it does is it\nopens it up in Wireshark.\n\n316\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.400\nSo I can see these and\nwatch these and look at all of\n\n317\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.214\nthe information about the protocols,\nthe Ethernet and so on in Wireshark.\n\n318\n00:14:35.214 --> 00:14:35.740\nOkay?\n\n319\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.250\nSo in this case here I'm just\ngonna click on this guy and\n\n320\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.190\nsay, just take me to the packets.\n\n321\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.170\nAnd let's take a closer look at this, and\nthen we'll get into the Malware events.\n\n322\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.995\n>> So when you download those packets,\nit's already in the,\n\n323\n00:14:45.995 --> 00:14:48.600\nWireshark uses that standard\npackets knit for file format.\n\n324\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.520\nNow I forget what the extension is,\nbut once you-\n\n325\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.470\n>> The pea cap, and so\n\n326\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.690\nit comes down and it opens what,\nit actually when you downloaded it,\n\n327\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.260\nit actually opens Wireshark\nif you have that running.\n\n328\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.200\nIf it doesn't it just downloads\ninto some old file, but\n\n329\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.320\nif not it'll actually open\nthe application and chill it.\n\n330\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.900\n>> And then they're packets just for\nthe attack traffic, right?\n\n331\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.630\nOr is it?\n>> Whatever I just clicked on.\n\n332\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.290\nIf I clicked the box and I say download.\n\n333\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.120\n>> Okay so it usually won't be huge\namounts of data because it's just related\n\n334\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.720\nto the attack?\n\n335\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.360\n>> I'm looking at that one attack, I'm\nnot trying to look at every connection,\n\n336\n00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.500\nI'm just trying to look at that one event.\n\n337\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.840\nIt's an intrusion event and\nI wanna do deeper down analysis on it.\n\n338\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.380\n>> Awesome.\n>> That's why we do it.\n\n339\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.940\nSo I can do that here, so\nnotice I came in here it says packets.\n\n340\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.670\nOkay, and I can do a search constraint\non some of this stuff, but notice here,\n\n341\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.690\nhere was the event and when it occurred.\n\n342\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.650\nExecutable code was detected.\n\n343\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.890\nCame from the outside the inside.\n\n344\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.320\nThat's typical.\n\n345\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.470\nNow notice this source IP.\n\n346\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.200\nI can do something here.\n\n347\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.680\nI'm gonna highlight this and\n\n348\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.240\nI'm gonna say you know this\nkind of seems to be a problem.\n\n349\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.670\nI'm thinking that he is.\n\n350\n00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.847\nThen I come over here to this search here.\n\n351\n00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:53.199\nAnd I'm gonna click on this search,\nnot the help search, this one right here.\n\n352\n00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:56.944\nAnd I'm gonna put him in here and\nsay, source IP Is this IP and\n\n353\n00:15:56.944 --> 00:16:01.498\nthen I'm gonna say Search and this is\ngonna show me all the events on that,\n\n354\n00:16:01.498 --> 00:16:06.740\ncuz I'm seeing this guy come in, I'm kinda\nconcerned, I've seen him quite a bit.\n\n355\n00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.880\nAnd now I can see all the stuff\nthat came from that source IP.\n\n356\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.782\nSo that's something that I use all\nthe time, I just wanted to show.\n\n357\n00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:16.910\nAll right, so now let's go back over\nhere and click on this guy again.\n\n358\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.760\nLet's see if I,\non that last one I did not think.\n\n359\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.430\nKay.\nSo now I'm back here, and so\n\n360\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.970\nI took this IP if I see a lot of events\nfrom them I'm going to search for it and\n\n361\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.050\nsee if he's a problem, and\n\n362\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.850\nif it is then all of these problems are\ncoming from and I might just blacklist it.\n\n363\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.430\nYou only see a couple right now so\nlet's go ahead and check it out.\n\n364\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.580\nOkay, so this is telling me\nthe intrusion policy that found it and\n\n365\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.610\nthe Access Control Policy.\n\n366\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.910\nSo, here's the deal, I see all these\nevents coming to my defense center.\n\n367\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.870\nAnd I don't know, I have ten managed\ndevices on this event center.\n\n368\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.670\nWhich one did it come from, right?\n\n369\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.490\nIn this case here since I didn't have\na different Access Control Policy on\n\n370\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.770\nthem I can tell you\nwhich one it came from.\n\n371\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.450\nIt's not as easy as you think to\nfind out which one it came from.\n\n372\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.860\nWe do have to do some\ndigging to figure out which\n\n373\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.660\nmanaged device it came from cause it's in\nthe defense center, it's all right here.\n\n374\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.235\nIn this case here I know where\nit came from exactly, pod three.\n\n375\n00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:10.000\nOkay, and that's a lot of times why maybe\nI would create separate system to help\n\n376\n00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.990\nfile IPS policies and access control\npolicies and so on, but you don't have to.\n\n377\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.960\nNow this is the Snort rule.\n\n378\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.370\nIt's an alert rule only, so\nalthough we saw it with drop the reason\n\n379\n00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.640\nthat it dropped is I took this event, I\nwent out there, and I made it a drop rule.\n\n380\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.890\nBy default it's in just an alert, right?\n\n381\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.350\nThis event is generally when a shell\ncode is detected in network traffic.\n\n382\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.160\nSo notice these variables here,\n\n383\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.110\nexternal net, with any source\nport number going to home net.\n\n384\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.930\nThis sound familiar?\n\n385\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.750\nThese were our variables that\nwere inside of our objects.\n\n386\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.730\nThat's why I said, hey,\nIf you're gonna go out there make sure,\n\n387\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.520\nyou're gonna change them, make sure and\n\n388\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.880\ntry not to screw them up too much because\nyou're changing all your Snort rules here.\n\n389\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.270\nAnd so we want to change our home net to\nbe only what's inside of our network,\n\n390\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.250\nthat's true, we can go ahead and\ndo that, but\n\n391\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.650\nI would be careful when\nyou're changing these, okay?\n\n392\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.900\nSo here's my Snort rules,\nso I can go through this.\n\n393\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.840\nNow check this out, guys.\n\n394\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.310\nRemember yesterday, or actually,\n\n395\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.620\nwas that this morning when we\nwent through IPS policies?\n\n396\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.040\nIt was this morning.\n\n397\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.860\nThe fact is is, I went in there and\nI saw this note rule and\n\n398\n00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.490\nit was kinda noisy, and I said,\nhey, we need to suppress it, right?\n\n399\n00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.150\nWe need to limit it.\n\n400\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.790\nWe need to threshold it.\n\n401\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.770\nAnd then we can do rate-based\ndetection and so on.\n\n402\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.490\nAnd the fact is is.\n\n403\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.020\nCheck this out.\n\n404\n00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.160\nSo, I see this guy here.\n\n405\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.250\nAnd I find out that he's not a problem,\nright?\n\n406\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.290\nSo, look at these actions.\n\n407\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.780\nNow, I can go and take the Snort rule.\n\n408\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.520\nSo, I can find the SID in here.\n\n409\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.590\nHere's my SID right here, so I'll just go\nto my IPS policy and search on the SID, or\n\n410\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:42.570\nI can click on Actions here and\nI can Edit the Snort rule from here.\n\n411\n00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.480\nI can actually change the server.\n\n412\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.210\nNow, once I do that, it will say hey,\ndo you want to update your IPS Policy?\n\n413\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.940\nThen you have to update\nyour Access Control Policy.\n\n414\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.490\nYou don't get away with that,\nso the answer is yes.\n\n415\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.500\nI can view documentation on this\nattack and it will comment.\n\n416\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.020\nSo now I can put a comment\nunder here just like I did when\n\n417\n00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.130\nwe went into the IPS Policy.\n\n418\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.850\nNow check this out, I can disable this\nrule and say hey this is a false positive,\n\n419\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.630\nI know this is coming from my RD I'm just\ngonna go ahead and disable this rule.\n\n420\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.530\nNow check this out I can disable\nit just in this one IPS Policy, or\n\n421\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:16.090\nall policies on my FMC,\nthat's already configured.\n\n422\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.150\nI can disable this in\nlocally created policies and\n\n423\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.370\nset this rule to generate events.\n\n424\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.650\nBut wait, there's still more,\nhold on there.\n\n425\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.950\nSo I can say okay, hey wait.\n\n426\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.430\nThis was just an alert,\nI'm gonna set this to drop.\n\n427\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:32.390\nNotice I no longer have to go out to\nmy IPS Policy, that I'm right here,\n\n428\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.500\nI'm seeing the noisy event, and\nI can tune it right here and there.\n\n429\n00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.980\nAgain I still have to\nupdate my IPS Policy,\n\n430\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.380\nI still have to update my Access Control\nPolicy, but I don't have to go search for\n\n431\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.130\nthis inside that little accordion\nthat I showed you earlier.\n\n432\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:44.970\nNow check this out, threshold.\n\n433\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.200\nI can set up my thresholds here.\n\n434\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.740\nI can limit threshold in both.\n\n435\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.910\nI went through those earlier.\n\n436\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.900\nI can do suppressions in all locally.\n\n437\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.460\nNow suppression basically says\nremember on this rule here.\n\n438\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:05.390\nI'm not disabling the rule but\nwhat I'm saying is my R&D is 1011.13.0.\n\n439\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.880\nThat's my R&D.\n\n440\n00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.340\nSo when any time this and\nthis rule is alerted from that network,\n\n441\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.150\nI don't wanna hear about it.\n\n442\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.770\nAnd I don't wanna drop it or anything.\n\n443\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.570\nI'm suppressing it.\n\n444\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.410\nSo be careful when you suppress this.\n\n445\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:20.000\nAnd maybe this will be more important\nthat you do this on a particular host,\n\n446\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.930\nsomething coming from R&D for example,\nthat we suppress it so it's not triggered\n\n447\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.350\nbecause we know it's not false, but yet\nit's still active for everybody else.\n\n448\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.400\nAnd that why I would use this, very cool.\n\n449\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.490\nHere's my packet information I don't\nhave to go to wireshark again.\n\n450\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.160\nEverything is still all right here.\n\n451\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.730\nI can just say expand all and\nI see all this information.\n\n452\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.380\nNow, in this case here I'm seeing all of\nmy wireshark information here I can go\n\n453\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.880\nthrough this.\n\n454\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.080\nThis is the actual attack right here it.\n\n455\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.680\nThis is very cool.\n\n456\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680\nI'm actually seeing the attack.\n\n457\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.080\nSo, I'm going to say you know\nwhat down load this packet.\n\n458\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.590\nAll right, so now I'm downloading it and\nI can take a look at it.\n\n459\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.833\nSo it now downloaded it, and it noticed\na PCAP so I can do it in Wireshark, so\n\n460\n00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:54.871\nI can do that from here.\n\n461\n00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:59.011\n>> Now going back to something you\nmentioned in probably the first or\n\n462\n00:20:59.011 --> 00:21:03.979\nsecond episode that we filmed was about\nhow when you set up FirePOWER in the very\n\n463\n00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:08.440\nbeginning, you had that option to\ntransmit the packet data to the MC.\n\n464\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.727\n>> Yes.\nAnd, if we hadn't done that,\n\n465\n00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:11.497\nobviously we wouldn't be seeing all this.\n\n466\n00:21:11.497 --> 00:21:12.331\nRight?\n\n467\n00:21:12.331 --> 00:21:15.540\n>> Yes, when we add the device into\nthe FMC, it says, Transfer Packets?\n\n468\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.480\nAnd, that's clicked on by default and\nyou wanna say, Yes.\n\n469\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.390\nAnd, the reason was,\nthis is one of the reasons,\n\n470\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.780\nI'll show you another one in a second.\n\n471\n00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.280\nBut, I wouldn't be able to get all this\ninformation if I hadn't done that.\n\n472\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.200\nYou're right.\n\n473\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.640\nSo, remember I told you, I said, this is\ngonna be important later because how do I\n\n474\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:34.800\ndo analysis on this on this packet or this\nfile, if I don't download this, right?\n\n475\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.788\nAnd that's really where we're at.\n\n476\n00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:38.164\nSo notice guys what I just did.\n\n477\n00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:41.380\nThis is what I do everyday.\n\n478\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.690\nI go in there and I look and\nI track this down, find out where it goes.\n\n479\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.230\nIf it's a false positive, it's so easy,\n\n480\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.370\nI'm going to suppress it and threshold it\nand whatever I'm going to do, right here.\n\n481\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.750\nI got the SID.\nI can go out there and do that.\n\n482\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.130\nI can change that.\n\n483\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.370\nI can go out to my IPS policy and\nchange that.\n\n484\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.980\nBut, why not?\nI can just do it from here.\n\n485\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.500\nIt's noisy.\n\n486\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.610\nAnd this is one of the things I said,\n\n487\n00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.770\nis you don't have to do this from here,\n[INAUDIBLE] IPS policies.\n\n488\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.540\nTypically, I'll go find a noisy rule and\n\n489\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.480\nsuppress it right there in\nthe event analysis, right?\n\n490\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.750\nOkay, very cool stuff, guys.\n\n491\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.890\nLet's take a look at one more thing here.\n\n492\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.640\nAnd that is under Files,\nnow I am looking at my\n\n493\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.110\nFile Policy what that gave I've\ngot Malware Events, File Events.\n\n494\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.610\nThe captured files,\n\n495\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.590\nbecause I said download files and\nthere were file directory.\n\n496\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.070\nLet's start with Malware Events\nsee if we got anything.\n\n497\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.560\nI think we looked at\nsome later earlier and\n\n498\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.410\nsaid hey let's see if we got\nsome it looks like fun, right?\n\n499\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.790\nSo, there we go it takes a second for\nthis to come up and now, I'm not gonna be\n\n500\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.640\nable to download this file, and the reason\nwas is this was a test file that I used.\n\n501\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.520\nI didn't really have a real Malware File.\n\n502\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.770\nBut nonetheless, I can see I would be\nable to get all the file names here.\n\n503\n00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.380\nAnd then I would click on this guy here.\n\n504\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.920\nAnd notice, this is the shaw,\nthis is the hash.\n\n505\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.930\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and click on this,\n\n506\n00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.000\nand it's gonna give me what's\ncalled the File Trajectory.\n\n507\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.730\nAnd what this File Trajectory does is it\ntells me how it traversed in my network.\n\n508\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.750\nNow this is not very fun\ncuz I only had one host.\n\n509\n00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.700\nBut when you see it in a real network,\nyou see it go from host to host to host to\n\n510\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.530\nhost and actually you can click on it and\nit'll actually show you where it went.\n\n511\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.120\nIt's very fascinating.\n\n512\n00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.960\nSo this will tell you hey, it went from\nBob to Sally, it tells you the name and\n\n513\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.900\nthe source and the destination IP address.\n\n514\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.830\nSo this is some really great stuff.\n\n515\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:21.410\nSo, we can see that it was transferred\nhere, and that it just went through.\n\n516\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.780\nNow if this was a real file,\nI would have the file here.\n\n517\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.650\nHere's my Malware.\n\n518\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.960\nThis is my disposition here.\n\n519\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.620\nSo, I'm going to click on\nthis Malware right here.\n\n520\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.740\nIt's actually just going\nto show me where it went.\n\n521\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.610\nSo, if I can click on this, and I can't\nbecause I didn't download the file.\n\n522\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.247\nBut, what this allows you to do here is\nsay hang on, went up to this file and\n\n523\n00:23:40.247 --> 00:23:41.538\nI know it's not Malware so\n\n524\n00:23:41.538 --> 00:23:44.960\nI'm going to change this disposition\nby adding it to the clean list.\n\n525\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.910\nRemember when I went into Objects and\nI showed you that File Policy,\n\n526\n00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.031\nwhere File objects where I\ncan add to clean list or\n\n527\n00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:52.660\nadd to Custom Detaching List,\nthe white and black list.\n\n528\n00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.429\nAgain, I said, you don't need to do\nthis here Wait until you go out into\n\n529\n00:23:55.429 --> 00:23:58.349\nyour malware and then you can add them\nto the white or black list from there.\n\n530\n00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:01.678\nI say, hey man, every time I see\nthis shaw, it's a bad file, so\n\n531\n00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:03.980\nI'm gonna add that to my custom detection.\n\n532\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.050\nIt's my black list for files.\n\n533\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.080\nRight?\nAnyways, so I can change that right here.\n\n534\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.590\nThe other thing is,\nI can download the file from here.\n\n535\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.150\nSo this is very cool\ntechnology right here.\n\n536\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.170\nSo I'm watching it traverse my network,\nI can download the file for\n\n537\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.220\nanalysis on my sandbox, right?\n\n538\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.080\nOkay, so let's take a look at some\nfile events, if we have some of those.\n\n539\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.980\nAnd notice I have executable and\nsome archives here, and\n\n540\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.400\nnotice these were block, this one I didn't\nblock when we went to my file policy.\n\n541\n00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.280\nWe said, hey look it up and tell me\nif it's malware, then store the file.\n\n542\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.760\nAnd that's what it did.\n\n543\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.850\nSo, very cool stuff, guys.\n\n544\n00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.190\nWe come in here and\nwe can see the capture files.\n\n545\n00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.930\nIn this environment,\nI didn't really have any, but\n\n546\n00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.990\nyou're gonna go in there and find these.\n\n547\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.750\nYou can get the files.\n\n548\n00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.510\nIn this case, maybe it's important,\nyou wanna send me your sandbox.\n\n549\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.040\nMaybe it's not.\n\n550\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.490\nYou're not gonna send me your sandbox,\nmaybe you don't wanna download,\n\n551\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.332\nmaybe you wanna download and\nsend it to your friend, you know?\n\n552\n00:24:56.332 --> 00:24:58.503\n[LAUGH] Mark it as cash payment,\nyou know, open this!\n\n553\n00:24:58.503 --> 00:25:00.780\n>> Now that you recognize it's effective,\nyou can, [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.829\n>> I'll let you know it's real idea,\n\n555\n00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:05.170\nit's real thread, so [LAUGH] all right.\n\n556\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.670\nSo that was really great stuff,\n\n557\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.270\nand, let me show you this one more thing,\nadvanced thing here.\n\n558\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.990\nWe've got just a couple more minutes.\n\n559\n00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.110\nLet me open up this one right here.\n\n560\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:21.241\nAnd so let me log in here real quick and\nshow you So\n\n561\n00:25:21.241 --> 00:25:26.380\nlet's come in here, I wanna get rid of\nthis guy here, and then we'll log in here.\n\n562\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.990\nAnd let's take a look at some other\nreal files that were downloaded.\n\n563\n00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.140\nSo, I'll take some\nMalware events from here,\n\n564\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.410\nwhich was much bigger now that\nI've actually got some files.\n\n565\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.660\nYou can see the enormity\nof the attacks here.\n\n566\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.320\nI'm going to go here and\ntake a look and see for some Malware.\n\n567\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.980\nAnd let's see what that\nlooks like when we go in.\n\n568\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.470\nThese are real Malware.\n\n569\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.830\nThis is what real Malware\nis going to look like.\n\n570\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.710\nAnd then here's my file names,\nand so bugbear.exe, right, so\n\n571\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.500\nwe'll go ahead and\ntake a look at this guy here.\n\n572\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.430\nAnd we're gonna see the trajectory is\nquite enormous compared to what we just\n\n573\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.530\nsaw on something like this.\n\n574\n00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.310\nSo notice that, look at how it\nwent through this network here.\n\n575\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.640\nSo we can just watch it go from host, to\nhost, to host, and do a trajectory on it.\n\n576\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.160\nI can download the file now, and\n\n577\n00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.929\nlike I said, email it to your friend for\nfurther analysis.\n\n578\n00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:17.685\n[LAUGH] Just kidding, do not do that.\n\n579\n00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:21.630\n[LAUGH] I can actually send it up to\nthe cloud for dynamic analysis from here.\n\n580\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.980\nBut one of the things is if\nI click on this guy here.\n\n581\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.220\nThen it's going to give me you know\nadded to my clean and back list here but\n\n582\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.650\nin this case here I should be\nable to get the threat score.\n\n583\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.210\nHere's the threat score actually\nit's not allowing me to open this.\n\n584\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.420\nA lot of times what happens when\nI look at this file when it goes\n\n585\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.040\nout the vulnerability research team.\n\n586\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.220\nI'm sorry now it's called Talos, and they\ngo out and they create this full report on\n\n587\n00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.500\nit let's actually go back out there\nbecause this is so interesting.\n\n588\n00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.970\nLet's see if we can find captured\nfiles and see if we can get something.\n\n589\n00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.200\nBecause I wanna show you t his report\nbecause it's extremely fascinating how\n\n590\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.440\nhigh these guys work.\n\n591\n00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.700\nSo this one's a very high thread score,\nright, and\n\n592\n00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.700\nthis is gonna tell me all\nthe executables that were very high.\n\n593\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.120\nSo let's go table view of captured files.\n\n594\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.190\nAnd then once I get in there\nwe'll pretty much be done.\n\n595\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.150\nSo now we're going to come\nin here let's go in here.\n\n596\n00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.370\nThe threat score is real high so we know\nthat we have a malware file we have a real\n\n597\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.650\nfile that's pretty bad let's see\nif it gave me a disposition here?\n\n598\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.284\nAnd it did here ok this is what I was\nlooking for look at the trajectory here,\n\n599\n00:27:25.284 --> 00:27:29.322\nand we're watching this go through it's\ntelling me the name, and the source, and\n\n600\n00:27:29.322 --> 00:27:30.494\ndestination and so on.\n\n601\n00:27:30.494 --> 00:27:34.298\nAnd how the actual malware cloud note\napp is the one that made this decision,\n\n602\n00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:35.980\nthat came back as a very high.\n\n603\n00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.780\nNow our third score on this one's\nvery high, the one that we did was,\n\n604\n00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.130\nwe did it kind of like high,\nnot very high.\n\n605\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.510\nBut we can see, here's my\nDynamic Analysis Summary from the.\n\n606\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:49.510\nBut let's take a look at the full\nreport and then we'll wrap this up.\n\n607\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.190\nHey, it's saying are you\nsure you wanna go there?\n\n608\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.650\nYes.\nOkay, so I'm actually going out to Talo.\n\n609\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.500\nYou can see I'm at Talo sandbox,\nall right?\n\n610\n00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.290\nAnd now this is the full\nport on this file.\n\n611\n00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.330\nThis is some very cool stuff here.\n\n612\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:06.180\nThis guy's giving us a lot of\ninformation on this particular file.\n\n613\n00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.160\nAnd so this is my information\nsystem behavior, and\n\n614\n00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.560\nso we can dig down deeper into this and\ntake an even deeper dive on that,\n\n615\n00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:19.020\nand again download this for further\nanalysis for ourselves from right here.\n\n616\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.720\nOkay, so\nthis is some really great stuff so\n\n617\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.161\nthe trajectory is great and\nI got this because of my file policy.\n\n618\n00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:30.920\n>> And the talo side of things that's,\nthat's again part of that subscription,\n\n619\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.660\nits part of what your paying for to get\na whole team of security researchers\n\n620\n00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.330\neffectively working for you So\nthat when the files come through you don't\n\n621\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.890\nhave to know whether they're malicious or\nnot, they've already taken care of that.\n\n622\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.730\nWe see that right there on our reports,\nthe system takes care of it and\n\n623\n00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.764\nwe just sit back and relax.\n\n624\n00:28:48.764 --> 00:28:50.057\nWell, hopefully.\nAll right, well Todd,\n\n625\n00:28:50.057 --> 00:28:54.409\nthat's a pretty good run down of all the\nevent analyses features that we've seen,\n\n626\n00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:56.350\nI think it's analyses, whatever.\n\n627\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.080\n>> Analysis?\n>> Whatever it\n\n628\n00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.750\nis, all of that event stuff.\n\n629\n00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.500\nSo we got a pretty good rundown on that.\n\n630\n00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.550\nWas there anything else you wanted\nto mention before we wrap up?\n\n631\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.230\n>> No, that's great.\n\n632\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.530\nIt's just that, this is some of\nthe stuff that I do all of the time.\n\n633\n00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.570\nI go through, we do event analysis.\n\n634\n00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.560\nI track down files.\n\n635\n00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.482\nI find out if they're real events\nindications of compromise.\n\n636\n00:29:12.482 --> 00:29:17.124\nAnd then I, you know, tune my rules.\n\n637\n00:29:17.124 --> 00:29:20.514\nNotice how I went into my event\nanalysis and I tuned them from there.\n\n638\n00:29:20.514 --> 00:29:24.242\nNotice how I went in there and\nI could add my file to the custom list or\n\n639\n00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:26.781\nto the whitelist,\nthe clean list for files.\n\n640\n00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:29.802\nRemember how I showed you how to do\nthese before but I'm really like,\n\n641\n00:29:29.802 --> 00:29:31.833\nhey wait until we get out\nto events analysis and\n\n642\n00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:34.970\nwe can do it right from there,\nand tune them right from there.\n\n643\n00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.320\nAnd that was a that's a really\ngreat way to tune your network.\n\n644\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.590\n>> And you bring up a really good point.\n\n645\n00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.650\nYou know a lot of what we've covered in\nthese episodes has been stuff we do when\n\n646\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.540\nwe set up fire power and get it running.\n\n647\n00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.550\nBut what we just saw is is really what\nyou're going to be doing day to day\n\n648\n00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.930\nas you go through and\nreview what's going on in your system.\n\n649\n00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.670\nEvaluating the events determining\nhow significant they are and\n\n650\n00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:53.870\ntaking necessary action.\n\n651\n00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.430\nWhich likely has already been taken for\nyou, so\n\n652\n00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.380\nits really just a matter of review.\n\n653\n00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.570\nAlright, well ladies and gentlemen,\n\n654\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.610\nthis is a great spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n655\n00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.915\nWe still have a bit more to get through\nbefore we wrap up firepower all together,\n\n656\n00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:09.794\nso definitely\n\n657\n00:30:09.794 --> 00:30:15.530\nstay tuned for more episodes coming up.\n\n658\n00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.710\nBut for now, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n659\n00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.870\n>> And I'm Todd Langley.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

and good evening.\n\n4\n00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:17.254\nWelcome back, for\nanother episode of ITpro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.220\nI'm your host, Don Pasette.\n\n6\n00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.330\nBack again with another\nepisode of Cisco Firepower and\n\n7\n00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.580\nin this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at Snort preprocessors.\n\n8\n00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.340\nI'm fortunate to have Mr. Tom Lanley\nback in the studio to help us, and Tom,\n\n9\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240\nI'm gonna ask a really\nimportant question here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.550\nWhat the heck is a Snort preprocessor?\n\n11\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.620\n>> A preprocessor is a piece of\nSnort code that normalizes traffic.\n\n12\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.780\nSo we wanna make sure that we\ncan read the data that we know.\n\n13\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.800\nWhat kind of where it came from,\nfor example,\n\n14\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.270\nto come from Apache server or\nan IS server.\n\n15\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.860\nSo we can read that data different.\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.710\nSo how do we do that,\nthe data different and\n\n17\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670\nwe read the header to make sure\nthere isn't any anomalies.\n\n18\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.458\nWe do defragmentations once,\nso we actually can see that\n\n19\n00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:01.520\npre-processes would give us\nan event as well as, a rule.\n\n20\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.740\nSo pre processes are generally very noisy.\n\n21\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.730\nAnd so we, there are a lot of\nthem are disabled by default.\n\n22\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.690\nWe'll take a look a t that.\n\n23\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.040\nSo let's go straight to he the screen and\nget right in to this guys.\n\n24\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.739\nTypically, before this last 5.4 code.\n\n25\n00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:19.837\nBefore 5.4, and so in 5.4 and\n6.0, they had moved it.\n\n26\n00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:22.004\nOur pre-processors were underneath\nthese advanced settings.\n\n27\n00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.630\nSo if I look under here now\nthere's really nothing here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.760\nThey were here.\n\n29\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.040\nSo here's my policy layers.\n\n30\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.940\nAnd one of the things I want to\nshow you that we didn't finish, or\n\n31\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.480\nshow you yesterday is when we did\nour fire set recommendations.\n\n32\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.930\nNow we see another layer here right, and\nso we come up here to my policy layers,\n\n33\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.370\nkinda changing the subject for one second.\n\n34\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.990\nWe can see that the built in layers,\nthere's my fire set recommendations,\n\n35\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.540\nhere's my changes layers, right.\n\n36\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.640\nSo it kinda added another layer in there.\n\n37\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.720\nBut, with that being said, so\nwe moved it from here, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.640\nSo really nothing here that we really\ngonna take a look at too much and\n\n39\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.800\nwe moved it over to where\naccess control policies are.\n\n40\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.950\nAgain, not sure why they did this but\nthey created a new policy about it.\n\n41\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.320\nAgain, like I mentioned,\nthese very smart people so\n\n42\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.600\nthey had probably really\ngood reasons to do this.\n\n43\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.630\nSo, basically, broke it out and\nwe get the same configuration,\n\n44\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.990\nsame pre-processors in this new policy\ncalled a Network Analysis Policy.\n\n45\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.570\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this, so I'll click it,\n\n46\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.920\nnotice that's where you get it,\n\n47\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.230\nand we put it in the advanced tab\nof the Access Control Policy.\n\n48\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.420\nSo, we can see I have two of them here.\n\n49\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.450\nI can just say, we'll create a policy,\n\n50\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.800\ndon't need to use one of those and\nsay, Todd's snort preprocessor.\n\n51\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.200\n1Z\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.524\nChoosing name is the most difficult part\nof creating a Snort Preprocessor [LAUGH]\n\n53\n00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:53.400\n>> I'm just gonna call it Pre-P.\n\n54\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.050\nAll right, so inline mode,\nnow we understand what inline mode.\n\n55\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.460\nComes in and goes out so, in other words,\nwhen I read it we can drop traffic, right?\n\n56\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.860\nBased on if a preprocessor\nis alert at all, and right?\n\n57\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.980\nIf a preprocessor is jumped on.\n\n58\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.660\nSo, the fact is we could\nset a base policy here.\n\n59\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.850\nSo, it's basically gonna give\nus more security above and\n\n60\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.060\nbeyond our regular Snort\nconfigurations that we've done.\n\n61\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.520\nSo, we've got Balance Security and\nConnectivity here.\n\n62\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.910\nNotice we have this down here.\n\n63\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.850\nMaximum detection now, right?\n\n64\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.020\nSo we have this capability of setting\na base policy of maximum detection.\n\n65\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.830\nI don't know if I would do that but\nyou can play with it.\n\n66\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.880\nSecurity over connectivity,\nbalance security and connectivity.\n\n67\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.230\nKind of have to really kind of be\ncareful here because we can override.\n\n68\n00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd sometimes when I go and\ntry to apply my IPS policy,\n\n69\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.440\nit says hey, you got,\nthis is a little too much.\n\n70\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.520\nIt kinda gives you an error to comeback\nand kind of play with these a little bit,\n\n71\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.870\nso keep that in mind so I'm just gonna\nleave this as bound security and\n\n72\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.830\nconnectivity.\n\n73\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.208\nWe'll create net at the policy.\n\n74\n00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:04.660\n[COUGH] Not quite as much inside these\n\n75\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.630\npreprocessors because these perform action\non a packet looking for malware traffic.\n\n76\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.350\nThat's what we're really trying to do,\nfragment and reassembly.\n\n77\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.750\nSo the rules look at\npackets one at a time and\n\n78\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.230\npreprocessors look at\nbehaviors of traffic.\n\n79\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.260\nSo that's what we're trying to do.\n\n80\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.740\nNow, so I can see over here, again, this\nwas just underneath that last advanced\n\n81\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.230\nsetting in the In the screen before so\nwe can basically see here.\n\n82\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.720\nIf I go down to the bottom here.\n\n83\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.640\nHere's my policy layers.\n\n84\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.490\nSo if I actually change these,\nwhere do you think they show up?\n\n85\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.110\nThey're going to show up\nin the my changes layer.\n\n86\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.090\nRight?\nSo\n\n87\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.100\neven though we moved it we\nare still doing the same thing.\n\n88\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.320\nNow, I'm going to tell you right now,\nwe're not going to change a lot of these.\n\n89\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.580\nYou might not change any of them.\n\n90\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.850\nThere's some I'll probably go in and\nsay you should probably do this.\n\n91\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.990\nThis would be really good for you.\n\n92\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.670\nNow a lot of people go in here and\n\n93\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.070\nplay with the DCE/RPC, this is my\nMicrosoft Configuration Preprocessors.\n\n94\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.670\nA lot them are disabled by default.\n\n95\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.630\nSo if you go in here and\nwe're gonna look at this,\n\n96\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.250\nwe can go find out which ones they are,\nI think they are Sid 133 or\n\n97\n00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.650\nsomething like that so\nWe can go in there and enable them.\n\n98\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.110\nBut why are a lot of these\ndisabled by default?\n\n99\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590\nBecause they're very noisy and\nthey create a lot of events.\n\n100\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.310\nAnd maybe they're not gonna be a problem,\nso it'd be false positive.\n\n101\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.430\nSo, we would suppress them or\nsomething, right?\n\n102\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.140\nSo, here's the deal.\n\n103\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.700\nSo, we're gonna come in here and\nunderstand that what we use What is for\n\n104\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.350\nour Microsoft world?\n\n105\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.540\nWhat is our base host?\n\n106\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.560\nWhat's most of the hosts that we use.\n\n107\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.170\nIn other words, how do we read the data?\n\n108\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.330\nAnd the answer is over here.\n\n109\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.910\nThey're saying, well read it like\nmost of it's windows XP now.\n\n110\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.860\nSo we use to send data You know,\nin Windows XP, so if we kind of\n\n111\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.320\nlook down here we've got Windows 2000,\n2003, notice there's just Vista here.\n\n112\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.370\nThere's not Windows 7 or Windows 10,\n\n113\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.530\nthat's because the data's read the same\nfrom Vista onto the new ones, right?\n\n114\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.510\nSo, basically, if you have Windows 7 on,\nwhich is very likely.\n\n115\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.270\nYou might wanna come in here and\nchange this.\n\n116\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.070\nAgain I'm going to leave this in\nsaying most of the preprocessors for\n\n117\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.980\nthis right here, most of the rules, I'm\nsorry, for this preprocessor are disabled.\n\n118\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.390\nSo unless you're gonna go in and\nturn those on for\n\n119\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.860\nsome reason this may be\nnot even be important.\n\n120\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.980\nBut for the fact is is that it might be.\n\n121\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.570\nI typically come in here And\n\n122\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.490\nchange this to this because I'm gonna say,\nokay I know we use a lot of Macs and\n\n123\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.960\nAndroids and all that, but most of our PCs\nthat we have sitting around are Windows.\n\n124\n00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.650\nWindows 7 or 8, or 10, or whatever.\n\n125\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.381\nSo, whatever is coming up, so.\n\n126\n00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.182\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now if we have a mixture, Todd,\n\n127\n00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:37.206\nlet's say that we're mostly on Windows 7,\n\n128\n00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.720\nwe still have a handful\nof Vista machines around.\n\n129\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.500\nAre they still scanned, or are they just?\n\n130\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.590\n>> Yeah, so here's what you do.\n\n131\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.570\nAnd that was a great lead on.\n\n132\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.660\nWe're going to come over here and\nsay, all right,\n\n133\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.550\n90% of my machines are Vista or better.\n\n134\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.130\nRight?\nSo, I can't imagine anyone would even\n\n135\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.860\nhave Vista.\n\n136\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.190\nRIght?\nAll I need is dream that is\n\n137\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.840\nVista or better.\n\n138\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.640\nBut, what I'll come over here and say,\nexcept for this guy here, There, right?\n\n139\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.940\nThen I come in here and say,\n1.1.1.1, whatever it is, and\n\n140\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.870\nI'm gonna put it in here and it'll say,\n\n141\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.170\nthis device here is Samba or\nWindows 2003 or Ezold Exp, whatever.\n\n142\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.970\nAnd I'm gonna put that in there so\n\n143\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.130\nwe can see that this guy I can set\nby hand and so that he's Windows XP.\n\n144\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.694\nBut my default Reading for\nDCE/RPC is Windows Vista, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.600\nSo [COUGH],\nI would go through and set this.\n\n146\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.980\nSo, you can see that there's\nsome work involved here.\n\n147\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.330\nNow, I want to tell you to\nbe careful with this here.\n\n148\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.500\nIf you enable these rules and, again,\nI noticed that most of them are disabled\n\n149\n00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.806\nbecause of void noisy but if you go in\nthere and say no, no, no, I want to.\n\n150\n00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:43.640\nAlert on DCE/RPC pre-processors,\n\n151\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.920\nthen you wanna come in here and\nprobably configure this.\n\n152\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.450\nBut we wanna make sure\nwe don't screw it up,\n\n153\n00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.830\nbecause then we're reading the data wrong.\n\n154\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.845\nRight?\nIt's not that it's bad, but\n\n155\n00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.250\nwe might miss an attack.\n\n156\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.438\nWe might not be able to\nunderstand it completely and\n\n157\n00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.449\nit might just be a waste of time.\n\n158\n00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.446\nSo, be very careful with this.\n\n159\n00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:08.245\nThe other one we're gonna take\na look at is the HTTP Configuration.\n\n160\n00:08:08.245 --> 00:08:10.819\nAnd this might be something,\nthese rules are enabled so\n\n161\n00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:13.680\nyou might want to come on down here and\ndo something like this.\n\n162\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.464\nThere's a couple of them we're\ngoing to take a look at and\n\n163\n00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:18.962\nthis is one of them,\nthe HTTP Configuration here.\n\n164\n00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:22.171\nAnd first off,\nwe can detect anonymous HTTP servers,\n\n165\n00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:25.188\nwhich means that if they're\noutside these ports.\n\n166\n00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:28.867\nSo we're listed here, I could get\nrid of all these ports here and\n\n167\n00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:33.520\njust say hey look, I'm only gonna look for\nport 80 or 443, whatever it is.\n\n168\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.190\nBut I can go out there and I'm gonna,\nagain, I can just delete those.\n\n169\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.920\nOops, I ended up going back here.\n\n170\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.710\nAnyways, I can get rid of those and\nthen detect anything that's outside.\n\n171\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.800\nDetect proxy servers,\ngive me some sort of event.\n\n172\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.860\nLook at how far do I\nlook in compressed data.\n\n173\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.926\nI know this gets a little intense and\na lot of people, they come in here and\n\n174\n00:08:55.926 --> 00:09:00.480\nwhat I'm gonna do is show you, hey what's\nthe minimum we wanna do here, right?\n\n175\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:07.020\nSo, in this case here I probably am gonna\ncome down here and take a look down here.\n\n176\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.900\nAnd I mentioned this earlier,\nkinda how am I reading the data?\n\n177\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.360\nHow do I look for attacks,\ndo I use all of Microsoft's servers?\n\n178\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.905\nMaybe, maybe use Apache, or\ndo you use custom servers?\n\n179\n00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:21.145\nThis custom one gets a little difficult,\nthere's a lot of configuration with this.\n\n180\n00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:25.290\nCuz let's say that I use all IIS servers,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.913\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\ntell it, hey when you read the data,\n\n182\n00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:29.800\nunderstand this is coming\nfrom an IIS server.\n\n183\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.650\nOkay, that's great, but\nof course I have what?\n\n184\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.210\nI have this other server that's\nrunning Apache, it's 2.2.2.2, so\n\n185\n00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.710\nI'll come down here for this guy and\nsay he's running Apache.\n\n186\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.685\nAll right and so then I'll list this here.\n\n187\n00:09:48.702 --> 00:09:51.824\nAll right, so\nthen I'll make this guy Apache and\n\n188\n00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.740\nthere's some other stuff\nyou wanna look at.\n\n189\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.190\nRight here, so this guy's running Apache,\neveryone else is running IIS.\n\n190\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.700\nI might wanna go and list it,\nbut you can see that this might\n\n191\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.782\nget a little administrative\noverhead if we're changing things.\n\n192\n00:10:05.782 --> 00:10:10.390\nChances are, just set it to what most\nof yours are and maybe leave it and\n\n193\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.230\nthat's what most people do.\n\n194\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.765\nNow the other thing is the server\nflow depth and all this is, and\n\n195\n00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:16.509\noversight directory length.\n\n196\n00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.925\nThis is going to give us, if we have\nthese rules enabled, we're gonna get\n\n197\n00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:23.580\nthese pre-processor alerts because if\nsomething's sending too much data.\n\n198\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.819\nAnd chances are we're going to send more\ndata than this amount of bytes today.\n\n199\n00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:31.177\nSo we might just come over here and\nsay, I set it to 0 and\n\n200\n00:10:31.177 --> 00:10:35.703\nthat kinda disables that field,\nall right, so I do something like that.\n\n201\n00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:37.846\nSo, it's the server flow\ndepth that I wanted to do,\n\n202\n00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.406\nnot the override directory link,\nbut that doesn't matter.\n\n203\n00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.523\nSo, I'm gonna set my server flow depth,\nbecause this is gonna alert me if\n\n204\n00:10:43.523 --> 00:10:47.170\nsomething's over 500 bytes, and I'm like,\nchances are that's gonna happen.\n\n205\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.442\nAnyways, so those are something I\nwould do with the HTTP processors.\n\n206\n00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.910\nAll right, and IP Defragmentation,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n207\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.940\nAnd now we're going to look at this and\n\n208\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.970\nagain, now I am looking at\noperating systems, right.\n\n209\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.090\nBefore we were looking at servers,\nup here is Microsoft, and\n\n210\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.255\nnow we're looking at operating systems.\n\n211\n00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:10.644\nSo what is my type of operating\nsystem that I use most here?\n\n212\n00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:11.910\nWe can see Windows OS.\n\n213\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.140\nAnd how do I defrag the data?\n\n214\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.080\nBecause as it comes in,\nhow do I read it, understand it to make\n\n215\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.810\nsure that I reassemble it,\ndefragment it and reassemble it correctly?\n\n216\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.424\nIs most of it Windows OS?\n\n217\n00:11:22.424 --> 00:11:25.200\nProbably, but\nobviously we can change that.\n\n218\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.122\nAnd then I can come in here and say,\nwell except for these devices here.\n\n219\n00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.590\nThis might be a little bit of work, right?\n\n220\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.960\n>> When you're adding other devices\nlike that, I know earlier you showed and\n\n221\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.020\nyou used a single IP.\n\n222\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.597\nCan you do a range or\nIPs or it's gotta be one?\n\n223\n00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.190\n>> Not really, no.\n\n224\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:44.120\nYeah, so it says single IP, CIDR block,\nor comma-separated, the list, right?\n\n225\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.630\nSo, I can do like a subnet.\n\n226\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:53.001\nSo I can say on my DMZ, something like\nthat, is gonna be something different.\n\n227\n00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:54.428\nYeah, so in that range.\n\n228\n00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:55.760\n>> That would save a lot\nof effort at the end of\n\n229\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.484\nthe\n>> Yeah,\n\n230\n00:11:56.484 --> 00:11:59.130\ncuz on a server farm I'm gonna\nsay these guys are this and\n\n231\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.474\nmaybe these guys are something else so\nyeah, that is a good question.\n\n232\n00:12:02.474 --> 00:12:05.840\nSo all right,\nthere is a couple of things on here.\n\n233\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.340\nI would come in here.\n\n234\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.420\nIP defragmentation was Windows OS,\nso if that's mostly what you use,\n\n235\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.028\nyou can just leave that alone.\n\n236\n00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:16.620\nI would come into the HTTP configuration\nand possibly set what my most servers are,\n\n237\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.340\nin terms of server flow depth so\nyou don't get a bunch of events.\n\n238\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.204\nThe TCP Stream Configuration basically,\n[LAUGH] this boost,\n\n239\n00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:30.706\nthis says, hey, this sounds great,\nlet's pick this.\n\n240\n00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.146\nNever click this, all right?\n\n241\n00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:34.850\nSo it's packet type performance boost.\n\n242\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:35.753\nIf I click that,\n\n243\n00:12:35.753 --> 00:12:39.627\nbasically what that says is there has\nto be certain values that I look for\n\n244\n00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:44.037\nand most of the time you won't see that\nin a stream, and so it'll just ignore it.\n\n245\n00:12:44.037 --> 00:12:48.702\nSo basically Isn't ignore most your\ntraffic is what it's doing unless it has\n\n246\n00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.859\nspecific events.\n\n247\n00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:53.010\nAnd the way that you can find out what\nthose are is I'll click on this and\n\n248\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.500\nthen come up here to Help and click Help\nand it'll show you the ones it'll do.\n\n249\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.116\nBut chances are you'll miss attacks\nif you click this cuz it's saying,\n\n250\n00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:02.942\nhey we're gonna skip a lot.\n\n251\n00:13:02.942 --> 00:13:07.748\nSo on my TCP Stream again, what kind\nof policy am I going to have here for\n\n252\n00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:13.150\nre-assembling my TCP stream, and\nunderstand and be able to read it.\n\n253\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.590\nNotice I've got a Windows 7/8 here,\nright, and then obviously for\n\n254\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.080\n10 and greater as well.\n\n255\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.160\nAnd I can come down here and\nchange some of this.\n\n256\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.408\nNotice we have the different\nports that we use.\n\n257\n00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:28.562\nAnd notice that these are client ports and\nnothing on server ports because we're\n\n258\n00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:33.650\ntypically sending from the client, right,\nand so we need to reassemble that.\n\n259\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.750\nSo anyways, so we probably come in here,\n\n260\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.015\nmaybe set our operating system\nhere that we use the most.\n\n261\n00:13:41.015 --> 00:13:42.568\nOf course I can come in here and\n\n262\n00:13:42.568 --> 00:13:45.497\nconfigure a range that says\nit's differently in here.\n\n263\n00:13:45.497 --> 00:13:49.171\nYou may or may not need to come in here,\nprobably go to the HTTP.\n\n264\n00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:51.463\nBut there's something else\nthat's not enabled and\n\n265\n00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:54.547\nif you don't do anything else then\njust do what I'm about to show you.\n\n266\n00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:58.849\nOkay so, we could go in there and\nset our HTTP and say we're mostly IIS,\n\n267\n00:13:58.849 --> 00:14:01.017\nprobably not be a bad idea, right.\n\n268\n00:14:01.017 --> 00:14:04.445\nTurn off server flow depth but\nleave the Microsoft one alone.\n\n269\n00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:07.499\nMost of them are disabled unless you want\nto enable them then you wanna go on there\n\n270\n00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:09.430\nand configure it but,\nhere's what you wanna do.\n\n271\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.494\nLet's say, Todd, I don't wanna do anything\nbut what makes my network work and\n\n272\n00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:17.333\nmaybe it'll read all this and it could\ndo it for me automatically and that.\n\n273\n00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:21.745\nSo I'm gonna come up here to Settings or I\nthink I click Policy Information actually.\n\n274\n00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:24.229\nNope, Settings, there it is.\n\n275\n00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:26.240\nAnd I'm gonna come over here and\nI'm gonna come down.\n\n276\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.423\nAnd we can see our Application\nLayer Preprocessors, all right.\n\n277\n00:14:30.423 --> 00:14:35.673\nAnd so those are, I typically don't\nplay with a lot of these, there's SCADA.\n\n278\n00:14:35.673 --> 00:14:37.294\nOops, how did that happen?\n\n279\n00:14:37.294 --> 00:14:40.730\nSCADA, Transport/Network Layer,\nand right here,\n\n280\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.580\nyou see something called\nInline Normalization.\n\n281\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.997\nSo I'm gonna, and I think this should\nbe enabled by default, but it's not, so\n\n282\n00:14:46.997 --> 00:14:48.527\nI'm gonna go ahead and enable it and\n\n283\n00:14:48.527 --> 00:14:51.092\nthen we'll see it come up over\nhere on the left-hand side.\n\n284\n00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:53.049\nThere's Inline Normalization then.\n\n285\n00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:56.440\nAll right, so it's disabled, so\nthe minimum you wanna get out of this,\n\n286\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.350\nif you're gonna not do anything with\npreprocessors, just come and do this.\n\n287\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.305\nWhy?\nBecause then it says, oh, okay,\n\n288\n00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:05.697\nwe don't understand all of this stuff with\nHTTP, we don't understand how to re-read\n\n289\n00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:09.809\nthis TCP steam, and all this other stuff,\nso let me do it for you automatically.\n\n290\n00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:14.130\nAnd that's what this is doing for\nan inline configuration, for\n\n291\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.990\nan inline configuration.\n\n292\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.600\nIf you don't have it inline,\nif it's in monitor mode or passive or\n\n293\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.480\nsomething like that, this wouldn't\nmake any difference, would it?\n\n294\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.210\nOkay, so I've got that and\nso notice I've got,\n\n295\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.950\nthere's my TCP Stream Configuration and\nso on.\n\n296\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.790\nSo all of that is under there,\nso let's go over here and\n\n297\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.386\ntake a look at Inline Normalization.\n\n298\n00:15:32.386 --> 00:15:35.191\nSo just a couple things,\nyou can set the time to live, and\n\n299\n00:15:35.191 --> 00:15:38.895\nreset the time to live as it come in\nyour network, maybe you want to do that.\n\n300\n00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:40.552\nBut what you're going to do here is,\n\n301\n00:15:40.552 --> 00:15:44.516\nyou're gonna click on Inline Normalization\nand you're going to say Normalize IPv4.\n\n302\n00:15:44.516 --> 00:15:46.086\nPretty much all you got to do here.\n\n303\n00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:47.950\nAnd just go,\nwe're going to normalize the headers, and\n\n304\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.590\nthe reason that we want to do that is we\nwant to put them back to RFC standards.\n\n305\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.340\nBecause if they're changed differently and\nthis is where our attacks come in.\n\n306\n00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.960\nSo we want to normalize the headers for\nTCP and IP and so on, so we look for\n\n307\n00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.503\nanomalies in the headers, in the flow,\nso normalizing the traffic.\n\n308\n00:16:03.503 --> 00:16:06.334\nSo, pretty much I leave\nthe rest of this the same.\n\n309\n00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:09.368\nYou can go ahead and\nplay with this and look through it.\n\n310\n00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:13.410\nI don't know if I'd change this,\nthe rest of it so, but\n\n311\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.340\nagain that's the minimum you wanna do.\n\n312\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.630\nLet me go back to HTTP for one second,\nI just wanna show something to you,\n\n313\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.380\nsomething that was on the objectives for\nthe exam and\n\n314\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.950\nthis has to do with looking\nat the cookies, right, so.\n\n315\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.930\nHere we go.\n\n316\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.620\nA lot of times we might get\nattacks through cookies\n\n317\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.210\nthat are coming in through HTTP.\n\n318\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.000\nSo what we're gonna say is we\nwant to inspect HTTP cookies and\n\n319\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.440\nthen normalize the header.\n\n320\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.400\nSo I can normalize HTTP headers to make\nsure nothing has been out of normal and\n\n321\n00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.870\nthen normalize cookies as well.\n\n322\n00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.400\nThere's going to be a little\nbit overhead in this, but\n\n323\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.530\nit might be something\nyou want to consider.\n\n324\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.893\nOkay, so let's say again,\nwhat's the minimum we gotta do here,\n\n325\n00:16:52.893 --> 00:16:54.225\nkind of wrapping up here.\n\n326\n00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:57.050\nWhat's the minimum?\n\n327\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.220\nI'm going to come in here, go to settings,\n\n328\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.760\nenable inline normalization and\nthen normalize IP version four.\n\n329\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.100\nOnce I'm done with that, notice that I'm\ngoing to come back up here to my triangle\n\n330\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.186\nand I'm going to commit the changes.\n\n331\n00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:11.410\nNow, again I now have to put this\nin my access control policy and\n\n332\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.660\nlet me show you how to do that.\n\n333\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.950\nIt's not the same way\nwe did the normal IPS.\n\n334\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:20.590\nBefore we would change this in our IPS\npolicy and it was just one big policy.\n\n335\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.310\nSo now I've got, so\nI'm in my network analysis right here, so\n\n336\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.020\nlet me go to my access control policy\nwhich I think I have open here, no.\n\n337\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.865\nSo, here's the deal this, see this one,\n\n338\n00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:35.510\nthis is a real event its over a hundred so\nfar a hundred?\n\n339\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.950\nOr wanna show you here now\nto be a pre-processor event.\n\n340\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.620\nSo now we're seeing it as a one.\n\n341\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.445\nSo let me come back over here.\n\n342\n00:17:49.342 --> 00:17:49.970\nOkay.\nSo I'll\n\n343\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.700\njust go to my access control policy here.\n\n344\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.730\nObviously, I thought I had it open,\nbut I didn't.\n\n345\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.530\nSo anyways.\n\n346\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.580\nLet's take a look at my\naccess control policy.\n\n347\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.570\nAnd this is how I get to\nmy network analysis policy.\n\n348\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.260\nSo I'm done with that.\n\n349\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.990\nNow I'm back here.\n\n350\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.640\nAnd so I'm going to go to my ACP.\n\n351\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.830\nAnd I don't put it in the same\nplace like I did the last time.\n\n352\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.400\nLast time, I created a rule,\nand a permit rule.\n\n353\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.540\nAnd I added my IPS policy in there.\n\n354\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.970\nNow we're not gonna do that.\n\n355\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.250\nI'm going to go to the Advanced tab.\n\n356\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.630\nThe Advance tab,\n\n357\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.180\nI kinda showed this to you the other\nday on where you would do this.\n\n358\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.830\nMost people, I gotta be honest with you,\nthat I show this to, I talk to about it.\n\n359\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.030\nThey hear me, they watch me, they do the\nlab and then they never do anything again.\n\n360\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.350\nAgain, you want to be careful with\nsome of this pre-processor stuff.\n\n361\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.241\nYou know it's not the end of the world,\n\n362\n00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:34.600\nyou know because a lot of\nthe rules are disabled.\n\n363\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.580\nBut if they do get enabled,\nyou could be reading data the wrong way,\n\n364\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.360\nit might not be normalizing, you could\nbe missing attacks and it's just,\n\n365\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.950\nit might make your network\ninefficient how it reads it right.\n\n366\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.130\nSo just be careful there.\n\n367\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.310\nWhen in doubt what are we gonna do?\n\n368\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.950\nInline normalization, agreed?\n\n369\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.036\nAll right,\nthat's the minimum you're gonna do.\n\n370\n00:18:50.036 --> 00:18:52.903\nNow, let's say you have\na passive environment and\n\n371\n00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:55.178\nyou don't have an inline environment.\n\n372\n00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:59.450\nSo again, so where do I put my\nnetwork analysis right here, right?\n\n373\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.570\nSo there it is right there.\n\n374\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.930\nThat was the one, no,\nI created a new one didn't I?\n\n375\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.959\nLet's go ahead and add,\nsee if it takes it.\n\n376\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.760\nSo I'm gonna put there Todd's Snort\nPre-processor right here, right.\n\n377\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.113\nSo instead of having a different one,\nwe'll put one right here.\n\n378\n00:19:14.113 --> 00:19:18.020\nNotice, remember this one before as we're\ndetermining which rule to use as it comes\n\n379\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.610\nin my security intelligence and down\nmy rules is the one we've talked about.\n\n380\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.160\nYou can set an IPS rule here or\nwe're determining file type for example.\n\n381\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.430\nIn this case here I'm gonna put this here.\n\n382\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.920\nSee if we don't get any errors.\n\n383\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.590\nSo, again if I put a lot of stuff in here,\nI'm adding a lot,\n\n384\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:37.340\nit might come back and say hey man you\ngot a lot of IPS policies going on.\n\n385\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.100\nYou might want to take a look at that.\n\n386\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.480\nI've seen that warning before.\n\n387\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.685\n>> Anyways.\n\n388\n00:19:41.685 --> 00:19:43.679\n>> I might have missed something there but\n\n389\n00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:46.762\nI know we can only have one access\ncontrol policy on our device.\n\n390\n00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:53.670\nAnd then you just attached pre-processor\npolicy to the access control policy.\n\n391\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.905\nSo, when would there be a scenario\nwhere we would need more than one\n\n392\n00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:57.780\npre-processor policy?\n\n393\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.550\n>> I can't do that.\n\n394\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.140\n>> So\nyou'd never really need more than one?\n\n395\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.060\n>> No.\nSo, I mean you could,\n\n396\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.730\nyou could create one for each ACP, right?\n\n397\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:12.551\nBut, again guys,\nbe careful when you're playing with this.\n\n398\n00:20:12.551 --> 00:20:14.270\nDo the inline normalization, maybe just\ncreate it once and put in all of them.\n\n399\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.940\n>> I see what I'm doing, is I'm losing,\nsay it's easy to do this,\n\n400\n00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.530\nwhere I'm looking at this and thinking\nthat you're working on one device.\n\n401\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.440\nBut you're actually on the FMC.\n\n402\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.250\n>> Yeah, and\nit's got multiple managed devices.\n\n403\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.460\n>> So you may have more than one\npre-processor policy because of\n\n404\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.280\nthe different devices is being applied to,\nso all right, that makes perfect sense.\n\n405\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.300\n>> So, and I'm not saying you can't\nhave multiple network analysis policies,\n\n406\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.550\nI don't know,\nI just wouldn't do that, I guess.\n\n407\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.920\nAll right, so let's say,\nwhen I had the inline environment,\n\n408\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.350\nwhich with an ASA you're gonna have, but\nwith an appliance you might not have,\n\n409\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.340\nit might be a router, or\nswitch, or something.\n\n410\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.640\nIn this case here,\nI use inline normalization for inline.\n\n411\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.630\nAnd just go set that,\nleave everything else alone.\n\n412\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.350\nAt least do that at a minimum.\n\n413\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.350\nRight?\nNow, we're going to come back here and\n\n414\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.410\nsay, when I have a passive environment,\nwhat do I use?\n\n415\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.280\nInline normalization isn't\ngoing to make any difference.\n\n416\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.510\nThat's only for inline.\n\n417\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.370\nSo I'm gonna use something\ncalled \"Adaptive profiles\", and\n\n418\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.560\nwhat this does is it goes ahead and\ndetects the type of traffic,\n\n419\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.110\nwhere it come from, so it understands\nhow to re-assemble it, right?\n\n420\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.600\nIt's kind of what IP normalization does,\nso we can go ahead and enable this,\n\n421\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.460\nbut again this won't make any\ndifference if I have an inline, right?\n\n422\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.800\nSo, I'm gonna say adaptive profile is\nenabled, the update interval, and for\n\n423\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.480\nwhich network, and technically is for\nmy DMZ and put that network in there.\n\n424\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.400\nSo, if I have an inline environment,\nI go do inline normalization.\n\n425\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.570\nIf I have a passive environment, I'm\ngonna go ahead and do adaptive profiles.\n\n426\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.730\nNow there are some other settings\ndown here you might wanna look at for\n\n427\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.850\nmaking your sort rules more efficient.\n\n428\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.650\nSo you can go ahead and what I would do,\nI'm not gonna go through these.\n\n429\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.990\nWill go down in it's performance saying\nthis is if, you know, you're on Friday,\n\n430\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.610\nyou have nothing to do, and you're a very\nhard worker, and you don't wanna just,\n\n431\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.530\nyou know, play, what's that game?\n\n432\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.210\nCandy Crush [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n433\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.950\n>> You know, something like that,\n\n434\n00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.420\nyou can come in here,\nhit the help screen, and\n\n435\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.390\nmake your rules a little\nbit more efficient.\n\n436\n00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.400\nJust be careful with some of these rules,\nguys, you know,\n\n437\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.870\nbecause if you're going out on\nmaking changes to your snort rules.\n\n438\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.880\nYou can do, make it a negative effect,\nas well as a positive effect.\n\n439\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.980\nSo, just be careful with that.\n\n440\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.130\nSo, we're good here now.\n\n441\n00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.790\n>> Excellent.\n\n442\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.550\nSo, once we've got our pre-processor in\nplace, now our data's being read properly,\n\n443\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.140\nwe're being handled.\n\n444\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.980\nOur outliers, we saw where we could add\nthose in as exceptions if you still have\n\n445\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.180\nlike, some Windows XP\nmachines dangling around.\n\n446\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.340\nWe've got some really good coverage there.\n\n447\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.360\nTodd, is there anything else\nthat we need to cover on that?\n\n448\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.220\n>> Well, all you do is, really, you need\nto remember that if you have an inline\n\n449\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.570\nenvironment, you're going to\nuse inline normalization.\n\n450\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.450\nPretty simple.\n\n451\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.540\nIf you're passive environment,\nyou're going to use adaptive profiles.\n\n452\n00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.830\nThat'd be the minimum.\n\n453\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.460\nI really highly recommend them.\n\n454\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.030\nNot sure why it's not on by default,\nbut again people are pretty smart so\n\n455\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.810\nI'm gonna you know say that hey\nthey know what they're doing.\n\n456\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.970\nAgain the network analysis policy\nyou see where you add that,\n\n457\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.200\nagain when you put that in there you do\nhave to update your access control policy.\n\n458\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.260\nI would go in there in minimum do that and\nyou could play with your HTP and\n\n459\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.810\nsay I have these types of servers make it\nrun a little bit more efficient make sure\n\n460\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.630\nyour not missing a tax and\nthat it understands how to read the data.\n\n461\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.270\n>> Excellent.\nWell,\n\n462\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.349\nTodd I think that's a pretty good\nrundown on those pre-processor policies,\n\n463\n00:23:07.349 --> 00:23:09.758\nwe're gonna see quite\na few examples there and\n\n464\n00:23:09.758 --> 00:23:13.308\npretty much know what we need to know\nto deploy that out in the field.\n\n465\n00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:15.831\nAnd that puts us at a pretty good\nspot to wrap this episode up so\n\n466\n00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:16.976\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n467\n00:23:16.976 --> 00:23:19.414\nSigning off for ITPro TV I'm Tom Pezet.\n\n468\n00:23:19.414 --> 00:23:20.332\n>> Todd Landley.\n\n469\n00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:21.875\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:17.269\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.240\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Cisco FirePOWER.\n\n5\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.850\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ncovering, this is a mouthful here,\n\n6\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.860\nour correlation policies and\nsome of the other advanced features that\n\n7\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.730\nare kinda found behind\nthe scenes inside of FirePOWER.\n\n8\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.240\nAnd really one of the ways that we can\ntake advantage of a lot of the data that's\n\n9\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.430\ncoming into our system.\n\n10\n00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.890\nAnd here to help us once again,\nMr. Todd Lanley.\n\n11\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.290\nTodd, thanks for being in the studio.\n\n12\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.940\n>> Thanks very much,\nit's good to be here, and\n\n13\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.810\nthis is I think our last section, right?\n\n14\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.881\nWe're gonna go through and let's talk\nabout why it's our last section.\n\n15\n00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.987\nA lot of times to be honest with you,\n\n16\n00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:50.875\na lot of people don't do\ncorrelation policies.\n\n17\n00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.150\nNow it's not that they're not fantastic,\nit's not that they're not great.\n\n18\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.550\nThey are, they take a lot of effort and\ntake a lot of work.\n\n19\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.658\nWe get them set up, and they can help us,\nthey can remediate problems.\n\n20\n00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:04.540\nIt's a really awesome policy,\nbut people just don't sit there,\n\n21\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.767\nI usually get to this point in the class\nand you might be in the same place,\n\n22\n00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.955\nsit there and go, gosh I'm overwhelmed,\nthere's just so much here.\n\n23\n00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:15.613\nCuz if we look down here and\nlook at my screen, what have we got?\n\n24\n00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:20.374\nWe went through file policies, intrusion\npolicies, access control policies,\n\n25\n00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:24.997\nnow with discovery policies, user\npolicies, and that we put it all together,\n\n26\n00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:27.430\ndid some attacks, did some other stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.881\nNow we have network analysis policies, and\nmaybe no one creates a network analysis\n\n28\n00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.660\npolicy, maybe they do, I think you should\ndo the normalization but it's up to you.\n\n29\n00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.430\nThat being said,\nthen the correlation policies, right?\n\n30\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.160\nThis is our last policy, so\nlet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n31\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.234\nIt takes a little bit of effort,\nguys, but it can help you.\n\n32\n00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:49.602\nSo you can see that I\nhad one in here already.\n\n33\n00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:53.881\nBut notice we have a correlation policy,\nand this basically helps us find\n\n34\n00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.320\nthe problem and fix it, and\nthat's really what we want to do.\n\n35\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.910\nInstead of just being alerted on it\nus going out and having to do it,\n\n36\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.240\nthis is basically saying, hey, if I see\nthis, I can create some sort of action and\n\n37\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.180\nit'll remediate the issue.\n\n38\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.240\nAnd by setting this up can make\nyour life a little bit easier,\n\n39\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.070\njust a little bit of work upfront.\n\n40\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.160\nSo the first thing I have\nto do is create rules, and\n\n41\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.720\nthen it's kinda like we've got these\nrules, whitelist, traffic profiles.\n\n42\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.660\nWe get these done it's kind of like\nour other policies that go into\n\n43\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.190\nthe access control policies,\nthis is the same way.\n\n44\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.418\nSo we create these, the rules, and they\nhave to go through the policy management.\n\n45\n00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:29.949\nTypically I'll set my white list and\ntraffic profiles and\n\n46\n00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.478\nput them into policy management as well.\n\n47\n00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.493\nBut so let's go ahead and\nwe'll go ahead and start with the robot.\n\n48\n00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:38.030\nRemember we, here's my alert and\nhere's my remediations.\n\n49\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.090\nIn other words, if something occurs,\nwhat do I do about it?\n\n50\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.188\nAnd we remediate the issue, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:46.710\nSo it's not gonna remediate it by default,\nso we have to do that.\n\n52\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.260\nSo first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ncome to Alerts and I'm gonna set up some\n\n53\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.630\nalerts and say, hey, if this happens,\nI wanna be alerted, right?\n\n54\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.760\nSo I'm gonna say Create Alert,\nand I can create an email alert.\n\n55\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.262\nNow before I can create an email alert I\nhave to go to the system policy as I've\n\n56\n00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:02.628\nmentioned many times and\ncreate that email relay.\n\n57\n00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:06.470\nIn this case here,\nwe'll create an SNMP alert and\n\n58\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.399\nI'll just kind of name it SNMP alert.\n\n59\n00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:14.092\nAnd the trap server version three.\n\n60\n00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:16.517\nLet's not do commas in my IP address,\nwhat do you think?\n\n61\n00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:17.673\n>> [LAUGH] I thought\nthat might be European,\n\n62\n00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:18.766\nyou had the European for some people.\n\n63\n00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.695\n>> Well I use IPv5,\nyou guys don't use IPv5?\n\n64\n00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:22.379\n>> It's the best version.\n\n65\n00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.588\n>> It's cuz you can put commas in\nthere and you can make it really long.\n\n66\n00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:25.459\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n67\n00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.816\nSo I'm not gonna put version\nthree in here, you know why?\n\n68\n00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:29.173\nIt's just too much configuration.\n\n69\n00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:33.211\nSo my community stream is public and\nI'm not saying use version one,\n\n70\n00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:35.792\nI'm just being lazy in this video, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:38.299\nSo use version three and\nput your authentication in there.\n\n72\n00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.619\nIt uses TCP so\nit's why we wanna use this MPV3.\n\n73\n00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.895\nAll right so it's here, notice it's\nnot used right now but it is alert.\n\n74\n00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:49.038\nI'm not a big SNMP fan anymore,\nI'm more of a syslog guy,\n\n75\n00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:54.805\nbecause syslog gives us so much, a bigger\nbreadth of knowledge right than SNMP.\n\n76\n00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:57.910\nSo you might have an NMS station and\nit's still on your screen and\n\n77\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.244\nit can turn something red for you,\nbut syslog's still pretty good so\n\n78\n00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:04.317\nI'm not saying you can't use it,\nI just don't always use it.\n\n79\n00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:09.180\nI'm also gonna create a syslog here,\nTodd's Syslog,\n\n80\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.908\nthe host is 2.2.2.2, can do that.\n\n81\n00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:15.346\nDidn't like my comma, by the way.\n\n82\n00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:19.111\nSo you can do underscores and\nno commas, right?\n\n83\n00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.090\nAll right, port 514 is fine,\nand alert is fine,\n\n84\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.770\nnow I'm not gonna go through this,\nthis isn't a Syslog class.\n\n85\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.240\nSo you can go ahead and\nread through some of these, but\n\n86\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.193\nI'll probably do info which is level\nsix out of eight, zero through seven.\n\n87\n00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:38.365\nBut and you can have a tag if\nit's like for vender information,\n\n88\n00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:40.230\nagain not a Syslog class.\n\n89\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.421\nSo notice they're enabled by default,\nI can disable them, yeah I can edit them.\n\n90\n00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.021\nSo now I've created a couple of alerts.\n\n91\n00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.822\nSo if you're doing something like this,\n\n92\n00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:54.740\nthen what we're doing is\nwe're benchmarking stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.157\nAnd then we're saying hey,\nif something changes let me know,\n\n94\n00:04:57.157 --> 00:04:59.265\nmaybe it's critical enough for\nyou to set up an email.\n\n95\n00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.184\nAgain, I'd have to go to system\npolicies first before I did that.\n\n96\n00:05:02.184 --> 00:05:05.145\nAll right, in this case here we can see\nthat we have different other types of\n\n97\n00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:07.270\nalerts, we're not gonna go through those.\n\n98\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.980\nNotice I have remediations, these\nare kinda like some fast path rules here.\n\n99\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.320\nIn other words,\nI can go just jump to these right here.\n\n100\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.839\nLet's go back to our correlations\nnow that we've created some alerts.\n\n101\n00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.507\nAll right, so now I go here,\ngot my alerts, we'll also come back and\n\n102\n00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:25.514\nset up some remediations in a minute,\nso let's go ahead and create a rule.\n\n103\n00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:30.188\nWhoops, I gotta create,\nyeah, come in here to rule.\n\n104\n00:05:30.188 --> 00:05:34.976\nI wanna be notified right,\nwe got our SMNP, we've got our syslog,\n\n105\n00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:39.176\nand so on, and I want to know\nif there's gonna be malware and\n\n106\n00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:44.307\nhow to remediate that, and I want to\nbe alerted if malware comes on here.\n\n107\n00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:45.701\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say create rule.\n\n108\n00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.639\nAnd I'm gonna call this,\nlet's say I want to be notified if\n\n109\n00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.783\nan intrusion event occurs, and\nthat might be a lot of notifications.\n\n110\n00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:04.217\nOkay, and rule description, rule group,\nin other words I can create so\n\n111\n00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:06.320\nmany rules that I can\ngroup these together.\n\n112\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.100\nI'm telling you this gets a little\nintense so just hang with me, all right?\n\n113\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.773\nSo now we're gonna go to our if,\nthen, or rules, right?\n\n114\n00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:17.954\nAnd we're gonna say,\nif an intrusion event occurs, all right,\n\n115\n00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:20.776\nI laugh because this gets really detailed.\n\n116\n00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:24.572\nAnd then I can add conditions and\nadd complex conditions.\n\n117\n00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:27.915\nLet's see, and click here, what do I have.\n\n118\n00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:29.824\nAnd the rule message, let's see.\n\n119\n00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.913\nAnd, let's see, what should we check?\n\n120\n00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:41.090\nAnd the impact flag, I like this,\nI'm just making one up here.\n\n121\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.170\nSo if an event occurs, and the impact\nflag is greater than, check this out,\n\n122\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.309\nis less than, is not, and\nI'm gonna say is, in this case, 1.\n\n123\n00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:55.160\nWe talked about this,\nif we get an impact 1, that's bad,\n\n124\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.570\nsomething we need to go out and\nlook at right now.\n\n125\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.820\nSo we say hey, tell me this, now,\ndon't forget, I don't necessarily have\n\n126\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.970\nto do this because I can just leave my\ncontact explorer up, but the idea is,\n\n127\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.570\nif something's happening while I'm not\nthere, I'm not looking at the screen or\n\n128\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.200\nsomeone's not looking at the screen,\nthis will tell me, and\n\n129\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.350\nI can have it email me at home,\nbecause I've got nothing else to do.\n\n130\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.210\nSo.\n>> And we would be building this around\n\n131\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.170\nour security policy, right, so if our\nsecurity policy said here's our escalation\n\n132\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.340\nchange, people we notify, that's-\n>> Yeah, in this case here, I don't know\n\n133\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.050\nif I would do an impact flag here, because\nyou're gonna get those all the time, and\n\n134\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.050\nI'm not saying that they're\nall real all the time.\n\n135\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.130\nIn this case here it'd be a pretty\npicky if I sit at home and\n\n136\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.839\nthis is what I live for.\n\n137\n00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.105\nI've nothing else in my life whatsoever.\n\n138\n00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.164\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n139\n00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.005\nI wanna know if [LAUGH]\nan Impact Flag 1 shows up.\n\n140\n00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:40.237\nJust because it's my whole life.\n\n141\n00:07:40.237 --> 00:07:41.654\nNothing else, so.\n\n142\n00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:43.593\nAnd so I'm gonna add another condition,\nbecause I can.\n\n143\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:45.070\nI'm gonna say OR?\n\n144\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.284\nOr AND, right?\n\n145\n00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:48.886\nSo I'm gonna say AND it's 1.\n\n146\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.687\nAnd we can do something else.\n\n147\n00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:53.442\nAnd here is the deal.\n\n148\n00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:57.184\nWe can spec pick a specific destination.\n\n149\n00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:01.493\nSo its the impact flag,\nand it is going to my DMZ.\n\n150\n00:08:01.493 --> 00:08:05.880\nNow, we're like okay, now,\nwe're being more specific here.\n\n151\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.045\nAnd I'm not gonna get every\ntime the impact one shows up.\n\n152\n00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:15.330\nAnd I'm gonna say, if I said is, I can\nput a host in there, is in is my network.\n\n153\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.560\nOr I can say, is everything but\nthis network is not and is not in,\n\n154\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.760\nI'm gonna say is in my DMZ.\n\n155\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.790\nAlright?\nOK, so this pretty,\n\n156\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.170\nit's a pretty good rule.\n\n157\n00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.710\nI made a little bit better, so\nI'm not getting emails or Cislog, or\n\n158\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.310\nwhatever every couple seconds,\nbecause that could occur, right?\n\n159\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.159\nSo, I can add an inactive period, and\nI'm gonna come back to that, actually.\n\n160\n00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:47.560\nOkay, so got that rule,\nthat's very good, I got that.\n\n161\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.050\nI want to add another rule\nthough from malware, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.650\nThis might be something that I take very\nserious, and I want to be alert around.\n\n163\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.560\nI'm gonna say create rule, and\njust say malware discovered.\n\n164\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.919\nOkay, not gonna group it, so if.\n\n165\n00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:17.579\nLet's see, if malware event occurs,\nthere it is.\n\n166\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.740\nTook me a second.\n\n167\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.170\nI need more coffee today.\n\n168\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.240\nA nowhere event occurs.\n\n169\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.450\nBe careful here now, guys.\n\n170\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.860\nThere's 2 different types of amp for\nthis product.\n\n171\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.110\nOne of them is a network base,\n\n172\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.510\nand that's what we get when we\nget our IPS license, we get that.\n\n173\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.230\nOur mail order license, excuse me.\n\n174\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.710\nThe other one is the endpoint,\nI mentioned that on the first day,\n\n175\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.440\nwe can run this up with an on a endpoint,\nand then, manage those.\n\n176\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.280\nSo now, I can sit there, and say hey,\nif an endpoint has malware, it might be\n\n177\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.320\npretty intensive, maybe we wanna\na thousand host, and every time someone\n\n178\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.230\ngets one, it's possible that we wanna be\nalerted on it, and you can set that up.\n\n179\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.720\nBut I'm not gonna do that here,\nI'm gonna say If a network base, now,\n\n180\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:05.010\nretrospective means if something happened\nin the mass, and now it's happened again,\n\n181\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.800\nwe can look back there, and see what we\ndid, what happened, and how to resolve it,\n\n182\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.420\nso we use our history to help us\nwith our current attacks, right?\n\n183\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.470\nSo, that's kind of a really\ncool technology, by the way.\n\n184\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.382\nSo, by network based malware detection,\nand it means the following conditions.\n\n185\n00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:27.250\nOkay, we're gonna come down here, and I'm\ngonna look for, what am I gonna look for?\n\n186\n00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:36.668\nAnd okay, if a malware event occurs, and\n\n187\n00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:42.490\nthe Source IP,\nI can do the Source IP here.\n\n188\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.450\nIn other words,\nI've been looking a the source.\n\n189\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.450\nAnd we've tried to block it.\n\n190\n00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.500\nAnd we think, we have the problem fixed.\n\n191\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.670\nBut I'm seeing this source\nalways sending malware.\n\n192\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.250\nThey keep seeming to get it.\n\n193\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.470\nWe keep fixing it.\n\n194\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.360\nSo now, we're taking enough action.\n\n195\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.580\nWe're saying hey, this is pretty serious.\n\n196\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.020\nI wanna get emailed, if I'm getting\nmalware from this source again,\n\n197\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.090\nbecause I'm pretty sure\nwe fixed the problem.\n\n198\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.590\nSo, I'm being kind of specific here with\nthe malware, I'm not gonna be broad,\n\n199\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.310\nbecause you might be getting a lot\nof alerts if that's the case.\n\n200\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:19.630\nSo, the source IP address is,\nor is in, the source can,\n\n201\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.830\nlet's say my sales department a little of\nmail order, they spent a lot of time out\n\n202\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.580\non their dating sites, and all that other\nstuff, which we're trying to block, but\n\n203\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.920\nthey're finding ways around it,\nor something like that.\n\n204\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.786\nIs in, and source IP is in here, but\nI also want to maybe be more specific, so\n\n205\n00:11:36.786 --> 00:11:40.892\nI can add a complex condition,\nI'm not gonna go in to those, but\n\n206\n00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:43.120\nI can add another condition here.\n\n207\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.380\nAnd then, say the source IP address is,\nand the destination IP address is my DMC.\n\n208\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:56.120\nNow, I'm being extremely specific,\nand you probably want to be here,\n\n209\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.970\nand this is why people why am I doing\nthis, this is an awful lot of work.\n\n210\n00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.950\nYes, but once you get this set up,\nit's gonna help you a lot.\n\n211\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.840\nBut you would have to think about this,\nthis isn't something\n\n212\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.220\nthat configures itself,\nyou have to be very specific on this.\n\n213\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.490\nThis is why a lot of people\nI know do not use these.\n\n214\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.100\nBut there are a lot of\npeople interested in it, and\n\n215\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.985\nas soon as I start going through\nit they're like, yeah, no.\n\n216\n00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:19.480\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna say 10, 11, 12, 0.\n\n217\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.250\nAnd again, we're just getting started\nwith this, we're not done yet, right?\n\n218\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.010\nAnd so, we'll go ahead and add that.\n\n219\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.600\nOkay, again,\nI'm gonna come back to this snooze option\n\n220\n00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.270\ncuz this is kind of important.\n\n221\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.588\nSo now, I've got my list,so this is great.\n\n222\n00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:40.140\nSo now ,I'm good, I've got my list,\nlet's go ahead, and add them to my policy.\n\n223\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.150\nAnd then, we'll save that.\n\n224\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.240\nAnd push it out to my device.\n\n225\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.240\nThis does not have to go through\nmy Nexus Control Policy.\n\n226\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.050\nIt's pushed out by itself, right?\n\n227\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.290\nOkay, so, I'm gonna go head,\nand say Create Policy.\n\n228\n00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.288\nTodd's, whoops I can't use a comma.\n\n229\n00:12:54.288 --> 00:13:02.800\nIntrusion and Malware Rules.\n\n230\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.730\nSo, we have an impact 1,\nthat is going in my DMZ.\n\n231\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.120\nAnd we also wanna be alert\nif malware comes from,\n\n232\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.070\nin this example, sales to my DMZ.\n\n233\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.430\nCuz we've been seeing problems with that.\n\n234\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.960\nSo ,in other words, we're being very,\nvery specific here, right?\n\n235\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.170\nWe're not gonna be alerted\nif just malware shows up.\n\n236\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.890\nIt has to be coming from sales to my DMZ.\n\n237\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:28.290\nAlright, so I can set a priority on this,\nI'm gonna leave that alone right here,\n\n238\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.320\nand I'm gonna say, I'm not gonna say save,\nI'm just creating my thing, but\n\n239\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.140\nI'm gonna say add rules to this policy,\nso, we have our rules we already created.\n\n240\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.830\nNow, you understand why I went, and\ncreated the rules first, right?\n\n241\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.790\nBecause creating this policy wouldn't have\ndone anything until I created the rules.\n\n242\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.120\nAnd I can see them right here.\n\n243\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.600\nWhen an intrusion event occurs,\nand a malware discovered, okay, so\n\n244\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.100\nwe can see there was one other in there.\n\n245\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.110\nI'm not using that.\n\n246\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.490\nIt was for something else.\n\n247\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.470\nWe're gonna come back to this\nWhite List here in a second.\n\n248\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.830\nAnd now I'm gonna add these.\n\n249\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.770\n>> But wait, there's more.\n\n250\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.753\nOkay?\n>> Order now, and get two.\n\n251\n00:13:58.753 --> 00:13:59.464\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For the price of one.\n\n252\n00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.320\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah,\nI could go back and create more rules.\n\n253\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.120\nAnd add to this policy.\n\n254\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.690\nAnd if you're gonna do this, do it.\n\n255\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.400\nAdd a bunch of rules.\n\n256\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.990\nExcuse me.\nNow, over here,\n\n257\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.420\nit says this rule doesn't\nhave any responses.\n\n258\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.710\nYeah, it's gonna alert me on it,\nit's gonna tell me.\n\n259\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.380\nBut really, the whole idea about\nthis is we actually fix the problem.\n\n260\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.260\nSo, let's go ahead, and\ncreate a response, and alert me.\n\n261\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.020\nWe're going a little bit\nfurther after this, too.\n\n262\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.040\nSo, this is my responses, notice my\nresponses, I set those up first, didn't I.\n\n263\n00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.940\nSo, I'm gonna SMP and I'm gonna Cislog it.\n\n264\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.530\nAnd you know, this is pretty important,\nand I would email it as well.\n\n265\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.180\nSo, I'll update that, and now,\n\n266\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.840\nwe'll see this guy on an intrusion event,\nit's gonna send me information.\n\n267\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.610\nOn this one here, I'm gonna go ahead,\nand send it to Cislog.\n\n268\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.450\nYou know, what I did?\n\n269\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.020\nI clicked on this.\n\n270\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.240\nBut I didn't click the up arrow.\n\n271\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.730\nI do that problem all the time.\n\n272\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.610\nMake sure you click on that.\n\n273\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.789\nOkay, so I'll save this.\n\n274\n00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:10.879\nOkay, so now we set up our responses.\n\n275\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.140\nAnd so, this is great, but\nnow, we can do something else.\n\n276\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.710\nWe can also remediate the issue.\n\n277\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.210\nSo, if this is occurring all of\na sudden we're gonna respond, but\n\n278\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.610\nwe're gonna create some\nof the remediations too.\n\n279\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.847\nI'm gonna come in here,\nand create a remediation.\n\n280\n00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:28.350\nAnd a lot of times I'll\nuse a Cisco null route.\n\n281\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:33.830\nWe have a PIK Shun that has some old\nnames here in upper remediation.\n\n282\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.260\nCreate something like this.\n\n283\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.710\nSo, install new module.\n\n284\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.260\nAnd specify a module.\n\n285\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.599\nSo, I can actually click what this is,\nand see what this is,\n\n286\n00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:52.642\nand in this case here, iOS null route,\nto block IP address on a Cisco IP router.\n\n287\n00:15:52.642 --> 00:15:54.626\nSo basically, if this is occurring,\n\n288\n00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:58.353\nI'm gonna say Stop this from\nhappening,and send this to a null route.\n\n289\n00:15:58.353 --> 00:16:01.365\nOkay, it's kind of intense, right, gotta\nbe careful, because what you're doing is\n\n290\n00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:03.577\nyou're blocking this We're\nactually stopping this traffic.\n\n291\n00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:07.857\nSo if Bob in sales, if the sales\ndepartment is sending malware there,\n\n292\n00:16:07.857 --> 00:16:12.280\nwe're actually gonna stop it by\nsending it to a null route, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.180\nThat's kind of a pretty good thing.\n\n294\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.755\nI understand this is intense guys,\nI get it.\n\n295\n00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:19.360\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and add this.\n\n296\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.740\nI'm gonna say Todd's, can't do commas.\n\n297\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.360\nA green router, right?\n\n298\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.680\nTodd's Green Router,\nawesome little description, and\n\n299\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.825\nmy made up IP address,\nwe'll use IP version four this time.\n\n300\n00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:36.926\n[LAUGH] And now if I have a Cisco router\nI'm gonna use the password in here.\n\n301\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.480\nAnd the enable password, right?\n\n302\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.400\nBecause I need to be\nable to log into that.\n\n303\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.260\nAnd if I'm using user names,\nwhich I very well may or\n\n304\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.465\nmay not be doing, I'll put that in there,\nand then add a light list if I had that.\n\n305\n00:16:52.465 --> 00:16:56.690\nInvalid instance name,\nI have to use underscore.\n\n306\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.671\nOkay, understand this is intense,\n\n307\n00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:05.720\nI understand you're\nprobably not gonna do this.\n\n308\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.439\nBut I wanna show it to you anyways,\nall right, so we'll go ahead and\n\n309\n00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:09.170\ngo through this.\n\n310\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.550\nTo show this now,\nhere's my configured remediations, right?\n\n311\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.429\nSo now down here, and\nwe'll say a new remediation type I'm\n\n312\n00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:22.344\ngonna sit here and say,\nblock source, right?\n\n313\n00:17:22.344 --> 00:17:28.358\nI'm gonna add that, and a remediation\n\n314\n00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:34.926\nname is Todd's endpoint of life, right?\n\n315\n00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:36.050\nAnd we're gonna block source,\n\n316\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.804\nI'll create that\n>> Now Todd,\n\n317\n00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:43.880\nif we're blocking the source as\npart of that remediation policy,\n\n318\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.591\nbut we're also saying direct\nthe traffic to the null route,\n\n319\n00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:51.519\nwould that just be what was detected\nthat goes to the null route,\n\n320\n00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:54.690\nand then everything else\nafter that gets blocked?\n\n321\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.170\nOr does the null route kinda\nbecomes like a failsafe almost, and\n\n322\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.340\nthe block is what actually does the work.\n\n323\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.320\n>> Yeah, at this point here,\nwe haven't done anything yet, so\n\n324\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.910\nwe've created this null route.\n\n325\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.860\nAnd at this point,\nwe're just gonna be alerting.\n\n326\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.844\nAnd now we're gonna create\nsome remediations in action.\n\n327\n00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:16.175\nSo let me go back to the correlation\npolicy here, so it was a good question\n\n328\n00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:20.861\nbecause the fact is, I want to understand\nthat when I created this policy, and\n\n329\n00:18:20.861 --> 00:18:25.552\nI didn't do it on purpose yet, I wanna\nshow you that it is disabled by default.\n\n330\n00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:28.251\nSo i created this policy again so\nwe're absolutely doing zero.\n\n331\n00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:30.112\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not even alerting right.\n\n332\n00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:32.272\nSo this case here now we're gonna\nstart alerting on those, and\n\n333\n00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:33.261\nnow I'll come back in here.\n\n334\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.469\nAnd add the response.\n\n335\n00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:40.219\nOkay, so I'll come back in here.\n\n336\n00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:48.344\nGo in there, it's got it enabled, and\nnow I can come in here and add a response.\n\n337\n00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:51.280\nSo in other words, for we just logging,\nnow we can do more damage, right?\n\n338\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.636\nIn other words, not more damage,\nI can stop the damage, right?\n\n339\n00:18:55.636 --> 00:19:01.261\nI think that's what I was trying to say,\nso I'll come in here to my rules.\n\n340\n00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:03.802\nAnd notice now I have a response here.\n\n341\n00:19:03.802 --> 00:19:07.177\nAnd this is like Todd's endpoint and\nbasically what I was saying.\n\n342\n00:19:07.177 --> 00:19:09.229\nAnd you might want to be\na little more descriptive,\n\n343\n00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:11.677\nbut I'm saying end of the world for\nthese problems, right?\n\n344\n00:19:11.677 --> 00:19:14.370\nI'm gonna update these, and\nnow I have a remediation in here.\n\n345\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.880\nAnd again,\nI did the same issue again, didn't I?\n\n346\n00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.487\nI hid it And be careful with this, and\nI keep forgetting to push that up there,\n\n347\n00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:22.552\nit's a remediation.\n\n348\n00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:26.491\nSo we'll see this now as I have alerts,\nand now I have a remediation, and\n\n349\n00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:28.761\nI'll do the same thing for this guy here.\n\n350\n00:19:35.302 --> 00:19:37.387\nOkay, and then I'm gonna save it.\n\n351\n00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:42.790\nRight, so basically I've created this,\nthis gets extremely detailed.\n\n352\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.780\nI have just given you an overview and\nscratched the surface.\n\n353\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.740\nI just want you to understand like\nyou have this capability, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.790\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\n\n355\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.690\nstop at this point because we're\nabout half way through, right?\n\n356\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.260\nAnd what I wanna do is show you\nsome things like whitelist and\n\n357\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.440\ntraffic profiles.\n\n358\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.130\nAnd I've got out some customers I'm gonna\nshow you and tell you what they had me do.\n\n359\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:10.890\nIt was relatively intense, but the amount\nof detail that we can provide with this,\n\n360\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.140\nIs really, really cool, so stick around.\n\n361\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.965\n>> All right, so we got a chance to see\ncorrelation policies getting created,\n\n362\n00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:21.137\nget them kind of put in place and\nturned on.\n\n363\n00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.865\nBut now we've got a little bit more to go,\nyou mentioned the white list and\n\n364\n00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:25.030\nthe other side of things.\n\n365\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.844\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nbreak this up into a two parter.\n\n366\n00:20:27.844 --> 00:20:30.976\nAnd when we get back into the second part\nwe'll get the chance to see the exciting\n\n367\n00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:34.203\nconclusion as we actually kinda round this\noff, and get it kinda full featured and\n\n368\n00:20:34.203 --> 00:20:34.808\nput in place.\n\n369\n00:20:34.808 --> 00:20:37.272\nSo you'll definitely wanna stay tuned for\nthat, but for\n\n370\n00:20:37.272 --> 00:20:38.719\nnow we'll wrap this episode up.\n\n371\n00:20:38.719 --> 00:20:41.468\nSo signing off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n372\n00:20:41.468 --> 00:20:42.510\n>> And Tod Langley.\n\n373\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.052\n>> And we'll see you back in part two.\n\n",

00:00:17.260\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.850\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.800\nBack again with another\nepisode of Cisco Firepower.\n\n6\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.330\nThis is actually part two to\nthe episode we started before,\n\n7\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.010\nwhich was Correlation Policies.\n\n8\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.598\nAnd in that episode we got a chance to see\nkind of setting up a correlation policy.\n\n9\n00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.397\nAnd now we're at the point where we\nwant to take a look at some of the more\n\n10\n00:00:33.397 --> 00:00:36.680\nadvanced features, like white list, and\nso that's where we're gonna pick up.\n\n11\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.820\nIf you haven't watched that first episode,\nI definitely encourage you to jump\n\n12\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.120\nback and catch it, cuz otherwise you'll be\na little lost as we jump into this one.\n\n13\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.024\nBut without further ado I've got Mr.\n\n14\n00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:48.907\nTodd Lanley back in the studio here to\nhelp walk us through the whole process.\n\n15\n00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:49.698\nTodd?\n>> All right.\n\n16\n00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:50.650\n>> Let's give it a go.\n\n17\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.509\n>> Let's do that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:55.680\nSo, what we're going to look at now\nis something called white list and\n\n19\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.220\ntraffic profiles.\n\n20\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.900\nMaybe you don't create any rules and put\nthem in your correlation policy because\n\n21\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900\nthat's a little too much detail for you.\n\n22\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.570\nThis is something you probably\nwill want to do, white list and\n\n23\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.510\ntraffic profiles because what white\nlists do is say hey on this network,\n\n24\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.180\nand I'll just keep picking on sales.\n\n25\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.820\nI always have had some trauma\nin the past with some sales\n\n26\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.540\ndepartment at companies I worked with or\nsomething, so\n\n27\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.500\nI seem to always pick on sales\nwhen I'm doing demonstrations.\n\n28\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.749\nBut anyways,\nin this case here Sales is out there and\n\n29\n00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.009\nwe told him you can't add a PC or\nyou can't add a mac.\n\n30\n00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.797\nYou can't run Firefox.\n\n31\n00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:35.320\nYou know so we're basically telling\nthem what they can and cannot do.\n\n32\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.470\nAnd if they change that we're going\nto get a whitelist violation.\n\n33\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.450\nAnd so\nthen we'll be able to take action on that.\n\n34\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.230\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n35\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.810\nThe other thing that we'll\nlook at is traffic profiles.\n\n36\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.110\nWell I'll go out and get a benchmark\non some traffic on a network.\n\n37\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.963\nAnd then when that changes we could say,\nhey, alert me and\n\n38\n00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:57.652\ntell me what's going on and\nremediate it, actually.\n\n39\n00:01:57.652 --> 00:01:59.150\nAnd actually stop the data.\n\n40\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.980\nAnd that's what I did for one customer.\n\n41\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.270\nSo I'm gonna come back and explain that.\n\n42\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.440\nBut let's start with whitelists.\n\n43\n00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.391\nLet's go here.\n\n44\n00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.680\nI'm going to create a whitelist, and\nfirst thing I have to do is I'm gonna say,\n\n45\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.753\nwell which network do I want\nto create this whitelist on,\n\n46\n00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.460\ncuz I need to find out\nwhat's out there right now.\n\n47\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.030\nSo in this case here again,\nI'm kind of a small network right now, but\n\n48\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.690\nin production this would actually\ncome up relatively quickly.\n\n49\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.052\nNow you don't put a slash or anything,\n\n50\n00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:25.954\njust take how many bits are on in your net\nmass, in this case, it's eight, right?\n\n51\n00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:28.920\nSo I don't put a slash 8 or slash 24.\n\n52\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.570\nSo I'm gonna say go look at network\nten and tell me what you found.\n\n53\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.050\nAnd notice it found anything\nit came up with a bam.\n\n54\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.238\nNow, in a larger network when I go and\nlook at this, this is gonna go [SOUND] and\n\n55\n00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:40.274\nit's gonna be a lot of information.\n\n56\n00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:42.841\nYou get a little overwhelmed\nwhen you start looking at this,\n\n57\n00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.930\nseeing all the applications, all\nthe protocols, all the different clients.\n\n58\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.540\nAnd you're just like, wow, I didn't really\nrealize how much we really had out there.\n\n59\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.680\nI thought everyone just kinda ran\nWindows 7 or Windows 10 or whatever.\n\n60\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.190\nAnyways, here's our main network here.\n\n61\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.980\nSo, I can click on this.\n\n62\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.279\nAnd so, here's my target and I can set\nsome host attributes, and some VLAN stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.240\nI typically don't screw\nwith something like that.\n\n64\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.870\nWhat I'll typically do is\nallowed host profiles here.\n\n65\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.580\nAnd notice it found the operating system.\n\n66\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.730\nSo I'm going to click on this.\n\n67\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.060\nAnd I'm going to say okay here's CentOS.\n\n68\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.332\nHere's Google Android let's pick on them.\n\n69\n00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:21.990\nAll right, and so basically we can say\nwhat applications these guys can run.\n\n70\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.510\nSeriously, we could say you can run this,\nor\n\n71\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.920\nyou can't run that and\nwe can stop you from doing it.\n\n72\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.310\nAnd which version, right,\nthat we're going to take a look at.\n\n73\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.967\nAgain, we're not seeing a lot of data\nhere, it's a very small network.\n\n74\n00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.295\nSo, when you do this on your real network,\n\n75\n00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.348\nyou're gonna get a ton of\ndata here in Allowed Clients.\n\n76\n00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:42.310\nSo let me go ahead and\ntake a look at a larger network here,\n\n77\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.964\nand let's say, let me click on this.\n\n78\n00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:47.589\nAnd bring this up and show you an example,\n\n79\n00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:51.789\nI think I'm bringing this up of\nsomething that would look larger.\n\n80\n00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.949\nSo we come in here and click on our\nwhite list, there it is right there.\n\n81\n00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.796\nAnd see that target network we\nleft is zero and that's fine and\n\n82\n00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:00.833\nmaybe you want to do this and\nsay hey I want all networks that I get.\n\n83\n00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:06.202\nBut notice that we come down here\non all of this information here.\n\n84\n00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:10.638\nI'm always shocked when I go out there and\nsee all these different operating systems.\n\n85\n00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:16.113\nSo I'm going to say, you know what on\nGoogle, again I'll pick on the Android.\n\n86\n00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.785\nI'm an iPhone guy what can I tell you.\n\n87\n00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:21.714\nAnyways, Google Android here, and\nwe can say the vendor is Google,\n\n88\n00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:24.301\nthe name is Android,\nand what version it is.\n\n89\n00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:29.801\nWe can specifically pick what allowed\napplications they can run here.\n\n90\n00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:33.665\nAnd say, if that's different,\nwe can stop them from running that and\n\n91\n00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:36.790\nget a white list violation and\nfind out what that is.\n\n92\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.700\n>> Now Todd,\nI've set up systems like this with other\n\n93\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.590\nvendors are other people\nother than CISCO out there.\n\n94\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.010\nAnd most of the MDM or\nmobile device management platforms,\n\n95\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.020\nthey require installing agents\non the phone to do this.\n\n96\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.670\nIs this still agent,\nI know there is a fire power agent but\n\n97\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.260\ndoes this work by capturing\nnetwork traffic or is this.\n\n98\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.450\n>> Yeah, it's only by looking at the\ntraffic coming from these networks that\n\n99\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.560\nwe're analyzing.\n\n100\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.870\n>> So we're actually going out there,\nanalyzing, and we're looking at\n\n101\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.230\napplications, protocols, operating systems\nand so on, and seeing what they are.\n\n102\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.320\nAnd if we see an application\ncoming from that network, so,\n\n103\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.030\nwe're not touching the hosts,\nwe're just seeing what they're doing and\n\n104\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.376\nthen we're gonna punish the user.\n\n105\n00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:13.960\n[LAUGH] We're into punishing our user,\nespecially in the sales department.\n\n106\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.370\nWe're gonna punish our\nuser if they violate this.\n\n107\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.470\n>> So if you're a sales person with an\nAndroid phone, you're just in deep water.\n\n108\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.352\n>> You're in trouble baby.\n\n109\n00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:23.020\n>> You know the real awesome part here\nis a lot of the platforms that I've\n\n110\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.300\nworked with, it was great for\n\n111\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.665\nthe devices that you at least were able\nto touch, that you can put your agent on.\n\n112\n00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:29.975\nBut in the bring-your-own-device world,\npeople bring,\n\n113\n00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:32.525\nwell, they bring their own device,\nI guess that's the whole point.\n\n114\n00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:34.465\nAnd you don't have your agent loaded,\nso this works without it.\n\n115\n00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:36.095\nThat's a big feather in the cap.\n\n116\n00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.880\n>> I am never a fan of touching a client.\n\n117\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.050\nBecause the minute you do that,\n\n118\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.920\nby the time you get back to your\noffice they're calling you going,\n\n119\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.795\never since you touched it,\nall it does is blue screen or whatever.\n\n120\n00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:49.650\n[LAUGH] It's all your fault.\n\n121\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.350\nEverything that happened to them.\n\n122\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.870\nMy wife called and yelled at me or\nmy husband called and\n\n123\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.010\nyelled at me because of you.\n\n124\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.050\nSo, you know, it's just always a bad idea.\n\n125\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.160\nSo I'll come in here, say what protocols\nI can use, web applications, application\n\n126\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.550\nprotocols, clients, for example I could\nsay if there was Chrome in here or\n\n127\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.130\nsomething I could say,\nokay I'm gonna let them use Firefox but\n\n128\n00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.090\nnot Chrome,\nwe're gonna stop them from doing that.\n\n129\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.260\nIt depends, so whatever you wanna do.\n\n130\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.880\nSo we can be very succinct here on\nour whitelist in this case in here.\n\n131\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.753\nAnd this is no application\nprotocols are allowed, I like that.\n\n132\n00:06:24.753 --> 00:06:27.510\n[LAUGH] Makes me really\ncontrol my users here.\n\n133\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.970\nSo I could sit here and say which\napplication protocols can I allow?\n\n134\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.240\nSo once I get this done guys,\n\n135\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.170\nI'm gonna come in here and\nmake the changes that I want, right?\n\n136\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.040\nWe're gonna see this.\n\n137\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.050\nAnd come down here and make it.\n\n138\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.110\nAnd then I'm gonna save it.\n\n139\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.100\nAllow protocols, web applications,\nand choose them.\n\n140\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.910\nAnd say on this network this\nis what I'm gonna allow.\n\n141\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.832\nAnd then I'm gonna save this whitelist.\n\n142\n00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:49.248\nNow, again, it's not gonna do anything.\n\n143\n00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:51.707\nIt's just kind of like when we were\ncreating our other policies we had to put\n\n144\n00:06:51.707 --> 00:06:54.022\nthem through our access control policy,\nkind of the same thing here.\n\n145\n00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:57.064\nSo I'll come back here to\nmy correlation policy here.\n\n146\n00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:03.203\nAnd this actually takes\neffect relatively quickly.\n\n147\n00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:07.550\nSo we'll come back under my policy Matt.\n\n148\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.540\nI'm gonna create a new pulse here.\n\n149\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.250\nSo now I have a new one.\n\n150\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.481\nSo Todd's white list for\nsales department that he hates.\n\n151\n00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:21.772\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Man I really gotta get some therapy\n\n152\n00:07:21.772 --> 00:07:24.080\nabout these sales guys don't you think?\n\n153\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.230\nI just have so much fun picking on them.\n\n154\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.702\nAll right so we're set here.\n\n155\n00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:31.270\nAnd we're gonna add the rules here and\nwe'll see that my,\n\n156\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.120\nI think I called it my white list,\nI think so yeah, cuz there's the default.\n\n157\n00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.170\nSo I called it mine.\n\n158\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.490\nAnd so I'll see my white list here so\nI can choose this, right?\n\n159\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.390\nAnd now I'm gonna add this in here.\n\n160\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.483\nAnd notice it doesn't have any responses.\n\n161\n00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:45.381\nSo, now I can actually create\na response that if they do that, I can,\n\n162\n00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.162\nnot only alert me but I can create\na remediation and make them stop.\n\n163\n00:07:49.162 --> 00:07:50.713\n[LAUGH] So, that's relatively mean but\n\n164\n00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:53.350\nthere might be something that you\nmight want to do on your network.\n\n165\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.340\nBecause you're saying, hey look,\nI can't have Firefox on this network.\n\n166\n00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.890\nWe found that it's really bad.\n\n167\n00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.675\nIt's got a lot of problems and so on.\n\n168\n00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:02.474\nOkay, so once I do all that and\nwe set our remediations and our.\n\n169\n00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:04.251\nResponse is the same, right?\n\n170\n00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.375\nMaybe I just do them all.\n\n171\n00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:10.963\nAnd then I remember to click up here and\nupdate.\n\n172\n00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:12.876\nSo I really didn't make any changes, but\n\n173\n00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:16.158\nthis gives you an opportunity to go\nin there and say what applications,\n\n174\n00:08:16.158 --> 00:08:19.180\nwhat protocols, and web applications and\nso on that can run.\n\n175\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.040\nAll right, so then I'll save this.\n\n176\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.561\nAnd it's done!\n\n177\n00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:22.978\nIt's generating traffic here.\n\n178\n00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:27.310\nSo, at this point here, I'm gonna\ngo to a network that actually has\n\n179\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.170\nsome whitelists running and\ndata going through.\n\n180\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.050\nSo, I'm gonna come over here to analysis,\nand\n\n181\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.310\nnow we created our correlation policies,\nwe created our correlation rules,\n\n182\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.820\nwe created our whitelists, and\nnow we can look at correlation events.\n\n183\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.370\nRight, we can see what happened.\n\n184\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.080\nWe look at whitelist events and\nviolations.\n\n185\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.494\nSo I'm gonna come here and say,\nwho's been violating this?\n\n186\n00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:50.280\nBecause maybe I didn't\nset up any remediations.\n\n187\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.582\nMaybe I just set up so\nI can get alerted here.\n\n188\n00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:57.119\nWe can see here's all these hosts right\nhere, and they violated this list.\n\n189\n00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.197\nSo, we can go out there and\n\n190\n00:08:58.197 --> 00:09:00.650\nsee how many times,\nyou'll actually see this quite a bit.\n\n191\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.184\nRight?\nOnce you set this up you'll see\n\n192\n00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:02.762\nthis occur.\n\n193\n00:09:02.762 --> 00:09:06.651\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at one more thing.\n\n194\n00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:11.884\nAnd don't forget to enable this,\nso this will be enabled now.\n\n195\n00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:15.279\nAnd then I'll start getting my list\nviolations relatively quickly.\n\n196\n00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.840\nAnyways, one more thing to\nlook at is traffic profiles.\n\n197\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.512\nAgain this is benchmarking\non your network here.\n\n198\n00:09:21.512 --> 00:09:24.782\nSo basically we're gonna go out and\nsay new profile, and\n\n199\n00:09:24.782 --> 00:09:27.388\nI wanna benchmark a certain network and\nsay.\n\n200\n00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:31.892\nSo, let me tell you what happened\nwhen I was at a customer.\n\n201\n00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:34.329\nAnd these are some great stories, right?\n\n202\n00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:38.316\nSo, they sat there, and\nthey had an engineering department, and,\n\n203\n00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:42.119\nit always kinda cracks me up depending\non what people ask me to do.\n\n204\n00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:45.788\nIt tells me that people just\ndon't wanna work at this company.\n\n205\n00:09:45.788 --> 00:09:49.672\nFor example, some guy asked me when\nI was creating the file policy, and\n\n206\n00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:52.541\naccess control policy, or\na filter and all of that.\n\n207\n00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:56.759\nHe goes, can you tell me when anyone\nuploads their resume to monster.com?\n\n208\n00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like, because I want to know but\n\n209\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.815\nI don't want anyone to know I know.\n\n210\n00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.680\nAnd I'm like that's why people are doing\nthis though if you think about\n\n211\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.355\nit, my friend.\n\n212\n00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:06.490\nSo anyways.\n\n213\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.980\nNo one wants to work here because\nyou're doing things like that.\n\n214\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.027\nIn this case here what was happening is,\nthere was a company and\n\n215\n00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:14.400\nthey had a lot of engineers\nthat were very upset.\n\n216\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.643\nAnd what was happening is they were\ndownloading all of this proprietary\n\n217\n00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:20.200\ninformation you know,\njust terabytes of data.\n\n218\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.580\nAnd going to the competitors.\n\n219\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.940\nThis was a true story my friend.\n\n220\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.450\nSo anyways, so they wanted to know and\nstop people from doing it.\n\n221\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.760\nAnd with a traffic profile,\nI could actually stop that from occurring.\n\n222\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.150\nBecause what we could do is say,\nwe're gonna benchmark this network and\n\n223\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.200\nthis is the amount of data that\ngoes through this network.\n\n224\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.413\nAnd when it exceeds x, y, and z.\n\n225\n00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:41.012\nIn other words, if it's was like 10 times\nthat amount we can actually stop it and\n\n226\n00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:44.055\nremediate it, right, through our\npolicy and that was a true story.\n\n227\n00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:46.561\nThat was something that I did, and\nit stopped people from doing that.\n\n228\n00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.303\nI just found it sad.\n\n229\n00:10:48.303 --> 00:10:51.543\nSo some of the stuff that I do,\nguys, in consulting is sad, right?\n\n230\n00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:53.193\nThis is a sad story.\n\n231\n00:10:53.193 --> 00:10:56.130\n>> Well, that kind of varies\nfrom country to country, too.\n\n232\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.240\nIn some countries, they want to hunt for\nkey words and stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.725\nI mean we do it here in the U.S. right?\n\n234\n00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:04.048\nYou get the trigger words\nthat a lot of the NSA and\n\n235\n00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:07.597\ngovernment programs are searching for\nthat in theory you could recreate\n\n236\n00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:10.415\nthat on a smaller scale right here if you-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n237\n00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:11.460\n>> Rain down with an iron fist.\n\n238\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.250\n>> Absolutely.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.938\n>> So again on these traffic profiles\n\n240\n00:11:13.938 --> 00:11:16.918\nthey get a little detailed so\nwe're gonna say profile name.\n\n241\n00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:21.090\nI'll pick on the engineering because\nthat's where we were at the time, right?\n\n242\n00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.670\nDid I spell that right?\n\n243\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.490\nEngineers.\n\n244\n00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.430\nI think so, close enough, my friends.\n\n245\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.650\nSo I'm going to look at some profile,\nso I am going to add host profile\n\n246\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.400\nqualifications and basically I just want\nto get some traffic information here.\n\n247\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:42.240\nSo I'm gonna come down here and\ncreate a new profile in this case here and\n\n248\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.770\nI'm gonna add a condition here and\nI'm gonna say if the initiator,\n\n249\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.670\nlet me see here initiatory responder,\ndo I have that in here somewhere?\n\n250\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.938\nEither initiator responder, initiator IP,\nboth initiator and responder IP.\n\n251\n00:11:55.938 --> 00:11:59.071\nSo in other words I can\nbe very succinct here,\n\n252\n00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:04.028\nI'm gonna say are in the engineering\ndepartment and whatever that is.\n\n253\n00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:11.774\nOkay, so they both initiate a responder in\nthere, because this was an example that\n\n254\n00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:14.770\nthe server was in this department\nin the same VLAN, right?\n\n255\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.779\nAnd then I can add another condition.\n\n256\n00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.478\nAnd found out what\nthe application protocol was so\n\n257\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:23.952\nI'm going to say add condition.\n\n258\n00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:28.787\nI'm going to say and the protocol that\nthey were using to download it was http.\n\n259\n00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:35.423\nSo I'm going to say and\nthe application protocol is,\n\n260\n00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:41.480\nI'll just type in http and\nit'll take me there.\n\n261\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.110\nHttp, okay.\n\n262\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.265\nI can be a little bit more succint.\n\n263\n00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.008\nIt's very possible.\n\n264\n00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:47.344\nYou gotta be careful if you're\ndoing something like this,\n\n265\n00:12:47.344 --> 00:12:50.068\nthey might use something like ftp,\nand we can type that in, or http.\n\n266\n00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:53.179\nAnd this was an example\nof an http download.\n\n267\n00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:59.603\nNow, in this case here we\nprobably want to look at.\n\n268\n00:12:59.603 --> 00:13:03.643\nIt gets a little detailed here.\n\n269\n00:13:03.643 --> 00:13:05.508\nAnd basically what I did is,\n\n270\n00:13:05.508 --> 00:13:09.330\nI created another condition\nthat gave us amount of bytes.\n\n271\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.250\nAnd so, we're gonna say and\nthe condition is okay.\n\n272\n00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.298\nLet's see, what did I choose here?\n\n273\n00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:22.829\nWas looking at bytes here.\n\n274\n00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:26.369\nSo I think I created another\nrule that gave me bytes.\n\n275\n00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:30.291\nAll right so I am going to say\nthe application protocol is HTTP so\n\n276\n00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:32.665\nI just type in HTTP and I bring that up.\n\n277\n00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:36.996\nSo the initiator responder is\nin the engineering department,\n\n278\n00:13:36.996 --> 00:13:40.273\nthe server happened to be in that same.\n\n279\n00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:42.928\nBut be careful, your responder IP.\n\n280\n00:13:42.928 --> 00:13:46.275\nThe server could be in a server farm\nin your DMZ or something like that.\n\n281\n00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:48.341\nSo be aware of where that's at.\n\n282\n00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:50.699\nSo in other words,\nI could say the initiator is this, and\n\n283\n00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:53.570\nthen create another condition\nsaying the responder is this.\n\n284\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.440\nOr I can give it a different IP address.\n\n285\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.270\nThey just happen to be in\nthe same VM in this example.\n\n286\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.133\nThe application protocol is HTTP.\n\n287\n00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:04.830\nRemember I could add another complex\ncondition and say if it's FTP for\n\n288\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.625\nexample and it's and or FTP, whatever.\n\n289\n00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:12.161\nIn this case, this is good enough,\nso I'm gonna come down here and\n\n290\n00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.616\nnow one of the things that I can do\nhere is on the whitelist as well.\n\n291\n00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:18.428\nI can add in an inactive peer.\n\n292\n00:14:18.428 --> 00:14:20.540\nNow remember,\nthis is when I would use my inactive peer.\n\n293\n00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.370\nIt's because, what happens if,\non there, is my back up server?\n\n294\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.408\nAnd I'm sending all these tons of data,\nand it's downloading, or\n\n295\n00:14:28.408 --> 00:14:29.431\nsomething like that.\n\n296\n00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:32.482\nSo, in this example here, I probably\nwouldn't have an inactive peer, but\n\n297\n00:14:32.482 --> 00:14:35.570\nthere would be possibly an example where\nyou would have an inactive period.\n\n298\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.450\nThe other thing on your\nwhite list as well,\n\n299\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.490\none of the things I'd\nhave an inactive period.\n\n300\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.930\nBecause I could set up in my white list\nthat gives me the number of connections.\n\n301\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:49.380\nIn other words I'm gonna say,\nin my white list on here I'm gonna have so\n\n302\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.540\nmany connections, and\nif that changes let me know.\n\n303\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.570\nIn other words, why I would do something\nlike this, and I've set this up before,\n\n304\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.330\nis I shouldn't be adding hosts\nat nights and on the weekends.\n\n305\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.480\nSo during the day maybe we're gonna\nsee a lot of connections occur.\n\n306\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.060\nBut on nights and\n\n307\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.010\nweekends if we see a lot of connections\noccur, that's gonna indicate a problem.\n\n308\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.430\nSo that's when we would set\nin an active period and\n\n309\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.840\nsay, hey during the day\ndon't give me an alert.\n\n310\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.780\nDon't do a remediation if we're doing this\ntraffic profile, if we're doing white list\n\n311\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.620\nor whatever it is because maybe that's\nnormal for this types of the connections.\n\n312\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.180\nI'm giving you an example of\nsomething I've done before.\n\n313\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.600\nWe don't wanna know about connections.\n\n314\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.730\nThat's a normal thing, but after hours\nit's not normal and I do wanna be alerted.\n\n315\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.410\nEmail me at home if 1,000\nconnections occur on the sales and\n\n316\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.290\non a Saturday night.\n\n317\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.300\nSales people don't work on\nSaturday nights, right?\n\n318\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.170\nAnyways, that's when we'd\nuse an inactive period.\n\n319\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.440\nSo I'm gonna come down here and\nI'm gonna activate this.\n\n320\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.976\nSo I'm gonna save this.\n\n321\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.940\nAnd there it is right there.\n\n322\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.478\nNow, here's my traffic\nprofile of engineering.\n\n323\n00:15:48.478 --> 00:15:54.443\nNow, in this case here,\nall we're saying is let us know if, and\n\n324\n00:15:54.443 --> 00:16:00.303\nI haven't enabled it,\nlet us know if someone is downloading.\n\n325\n00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:02.440\nBut we're not doing anything,\nwe haven't stopped it.\n\n326\n00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.755\nWe haven't alerted on it or\nanything like that in this case, or\n\n327\n00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:09.520\nset up an alert or an immediation,\nwe haven't done any of that yet.\n\n328\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.650\nSo what I'm gonna do is first\nof you're gonna let this run.\n\n329\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.770\nAnd notice the profile time\nwindow here is set to one week.\n\n330\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.430\nSo in other words, to be able to get\nthis to work, you have to benchmark this\n\n331\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.210\nnetwork for about a week to get an idea\nof the connections, the malbytes and\n\n332\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.670\nall that other stuff.\n\n333\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.130\nNow I can make informed decisions\ncuz I have my benchmark.\n\n334\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.618\nRight?\nOn the whitelist that came up\n\n335\n00:16:29.618 --> 00:16:30.467\nrelatively quickly.\n\n336\n00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:33.717\nOn this one, not so much my friends,\nyou've gotta get some quality data here.\n\n337\n00:16:33.717 --> 00:16:35.800\nSo I'm gonna leave this running for\nawhile.\n\n338\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.189\nAnd we'll go take a look at it.\n\n339\n00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:41.267\nSo to make this work and to,\nI don't have to do this.\n\n340\n00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:44.520\nBut I'm gonna do this because I can\nadd some more conditions to it.\n\n341\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.976\nIn this case, I can just let this run.\n\n342\n00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:50.937\nAnd all I'm saying is, hey, I want\na benchmark on this engineering VLAN.\n\n343\n00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:53.304\nThat's all I'm asking is give\nme the benchmark, right?\n\n344\n00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:57.770\nBut in this case here,\nlet's go ahead and create a new one.\n\n345\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.840\nAnd I'm gonna create a new policy.\n\n346\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.250\nSo once this is activated, at this point,\n\n347\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.170\nwe don't have to make it do something\ngreat, we could leave it like this,\n\n348\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.700\nand the only thing that we're getting\nout of this is our benchmark.\n\n349\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.010\nAnd that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n350\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.750\nWe're benchmarking this network.\n\n351\n00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.790\nI think we should benchmark\nall our networks right, so\n\n352\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.600\ncreate many different traffic profiles.\n\n353\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.840\nThat being said, though, we're looking for\na problem, we wanna stop a problem, so\n\n354\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.980\nthen we're gonna have to go in and\n\n355\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.340\ncreate a rule and\nthen put it into our policy, right?\n\n356\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.260\nSo I don't have to do this but\n\n357\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.100\nI highly recommend it because\nwe're creating a profile.\n\n358\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.060\nWe're gonna get information over a week,\nwe're gonna say.\n\n359\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.640\nSo let this run for a week,\nget your benchmark, and\n\n360\n00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.420\nnow I can create a rule saying, if it\ndeviates from this in x amount of ways,\n\n361\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.060\nthen we're gonna make some changes here or\nstop it.\n\n362\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.933\nIn this case here I'm going to\ngo ahead and create a rule.\n\n363\n00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:51.633\nAnd this is my, what is this,\n\n364\n00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:58.227\nthis is my engineering traffic profile.\n\n365\n00:17:58.227 --> 00:18:04.830\nOkay, and so notice now in\nthis rule I'm saying on there.\n\n366\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.220\nSo I've gone and gathered information, I\nsay the number of bytes have been so long.\n\n367\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.410\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n368\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.262\nsay if a connection event occurs I think,\nwe'll try that one.\n\n369\n00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.933\nOkay, either at the beginning or\nthe end of the connection.\n\n370\n00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.223\nWe say at the beginning of\nthe connection or at the end.\n\n371\n00:18:23.223 --> 00:18:26.091\nAnd we should be able to get\nsome sort of bytes in here.\n\n372\n00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:28.770\nI think I chose the right one,\nwe'll find out here in a second.\n\n373\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.975\n[COUGH].\n\n374\n00:18:32.975 --> 00:18:35.443\nAnd here we go so the initiator bytes or\n\n375\n00:18:35.443 --> 00:18:41.100\nresponder bytes in this case here let's go\ndown to responder, the responder bytes.\n\n376\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.470\nNow, I need quality data\nto make this happen.\n\n377\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.049\nAgreed?\n\n378\n00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:47.270\nI have to understand what's normal and\nwhat's bytes.\n\n379\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.130\nSo we're gonna say responder\nbytes are greater than.\n\n380\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.980\nWhat we found is that maybe it's\na terabyte, a week, whatever, and\n\n381\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.430\nwe're gonna say that\nit's greater than that.\n\n382\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.513\nSo I'm just gonna make up\nsome number in here, right?\n\n383\n00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:04.637\nSo it's greater than this, all right,\nso that's all they have to do is greater\n\n384\n00:19:04.637 --> 00:19:08.842\nthan, so the responder bytes are greater\nthan that, and that's all I wanna do.\n\n385\n00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:12.226\nAgain, I have to have quality data,\nunderstand what it is.\n\n386\n00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:16.347\nAnd if someone's downloading a terabyte\nof data, then basically this is gonna,\n\n387\n00:19:16.347 --> 00:19:20.307\nnot only can it alert us, but we can\nremediate it, stop the download, right?\n\n388\n00:19:20.307 --> 00:19:22.681\nThis is an extreme example, all right?\n\n389\n00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.930\nNo doubt about it.\n\n390\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.923\nOkay, I can add in an active period if\nwe had backups or something like that.\n\n391\n00:19:27.923 --> 00:19:31.391\nOr we could say okay,\nnow we might see a lot of data there, but\n\n392\n00:19:31.391 --> 00:19:33.637\nthe responder bytes are greater than.\n\n393\n00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:34.896\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save this.\n\n394\n00:19:37.892 --> 00:19:43.658\nIn something more like this a normal\nthing that I would typically do this,\n\n395\n00:19:43.658 --> 00:19:47.381\nI would say this was\nan abnormal request for me.\n\n396\n00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:50.384\nBut a normal one is if the amount\nof connections like I mentioned\n\n397\n00:19:50.384 --> 00:19:51.299\njust a minute ago.\n\n398\n00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:55.346\nIf the amount of connections are greater\nthan on a Saturday, that alerted,\n\n399\n00:19:55.346 --> 00:19:59.408\nmaybe sent me and email, cuz then I\ncould find out, hey, what's going on?\n\n400\n00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:02.433\nIt's got 1000 connections in\nthe sales VLAN, as I mentioned.\n\n401\n00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:05.605\nSo, to make this do anything, I'm gonna\ngo to my policy and create a new policy.\n\n402\n00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:09.927\n[COUGH] So, I'll create a policy.\n\n403\n00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:19.600\nEngineering Traffic Profile.\n\n404\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.299\nOkay?\n\n405\n00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:22.261\nCreate my rule.\n\n406\n00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:23.219\nNow my rules show up.\n\n407\n00:20:23.219 --> 00:20:29.308\n[LAUGH] And, Engineering Traffic Profile,\nthere we go.\n\n408\n00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:34.141\nSo now I see this here, and basically\nwhat we did, is we went out there and\n\n409\n00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:38.897\nsaid, hey, if something's happening\nin initiatory responder, and\n\n410\n00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:44.551\nit's greater than x based on our profile,\nthen we're gonna do something about it.\n\n411\n00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:49.170\nSo I don't have any responses,\nbut I'm gonna do some response.\n\n412\n00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.290\nSo and\nbasically not only am I gonna alert on it,\n\n413\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.100\nwe're gonna stop it with remediation.\n\n414\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.300\nWe're gonna send it to a no bucket.\n\n415\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.180\nAnd we're gonna save that so, oops,\nyou know what, I did it again, didn't I?\n\n416\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.610\nI didn't hit that up arrow, right?\n\n417\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.980\nNo, I have to enable this, and\nI think I just did that, but yeah.\n\n418\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.360\nLet's go back in here and setup some\nremediations and some alerts right.\n\n419\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.510\n[INAUDIBLE] Oops, my white list.\n\n420\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.560\nI hit the wrong one didn't I?\n\n421\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.180\nSorry guys, give me one second here.\n\n422\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.597\nThat's my white list, so\nlet's go back to my traffic.\n\n423\n00:21:23.597 --> 00:21:27.006\nOkay, and, it was on top here,\nand I clicked the bottom one.\n\n424\n00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:30.442\nAnd, hang in there guys, we're just done,\nI just wanna set up my alerts, and\n\n425\n00:21:30.442 --> 00:21:32.229\nremediations, and we're outta here.\n\n426\n00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:35.019\nAll right?\n\n427\n00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:36.766\nThere, always click up there.\n\n428\n00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:39.633\nI do this a million times,\nand I always forget that.\n\n429\n00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:44.370\nOkay so now we've created a correlation\npolicy, we've created some rules,\n\n430\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.104\nwe've created a white list, you know,\nwe don't like Android on a sales LAN,\n\n431\n00:21:49.104 --> 00:21:54.057\nand we created a traffic profile where\nwe're benchmarking and And we went through\n\n432\n00:21:54.057 --> 00:21:58.605\nan extreme example that said, hey if\nsomeone is downloading so much data.\n\n433\n00:21:58.605 --> 00:22:02.306\nIn other words, they're basically\ntaking this terabytes of data and\n\n434\n00:22:02.306 --> 00:22:05.765\ntaking it to competitors which\nis unfortunately a real example.\n\n435\n00:22:05.765 --> 00:22:08.810\nWe can actually stop that from\noccurring and that's what we did.\n\n436\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.350\n>> That's pretty impressive Todd.\n\n437\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.393\nAnd it was a lot of steps to go through.\n\n438\n00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:12.973\n>> Yeah, it was.\n\n439\n00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:14.685\n>> And get a lot of moving pieces and\n\n440\n00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:19.063\nwith the stuff that we're pulling in from\nTalos and from the Cisco subscription,\n\n441\n00:22:19.063 --> 00:22:23.016\nthey've kinda already done this for\na lot of the attacks they know about.\n\n442\n00:22:23.016 --> 00:22:25.359\nAnd they push that so\nthat we don't have to worry about it, but\n\n443\n00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:27.267\nhere we really have full\ncontrol of that process.\n\n444\n00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:29.760\nWe can kinda do whatever we want, right?\n\n445\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.730\n>> Yeah, and honestly this part\nhere gets a little overwhelming for\n\n446\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.770\npeople cuz they start\nthinking about their network.\n\n447\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.300\nAnd you almost can work on this problem,\nthis piece right here, full time.\n\n448\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.766\nAnd I can create white lists and\ntraffic profiles.\n\n449\n00:22:42.766 --> 00:22:45.770\nAnd say this person can do that and\nthis person can't do that.\n\n450\n00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.600\nYou can see the level of detail here is\njust completely overwhelming at times.\n\n451\n00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.920\nAll right, so I'm just really,\npeople are like, I can't do this anymore.\n\n452\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.140\nI mean I'm having enough time\njust keeping up with my events.\n\n453\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.238\nAnd now we're sitting here saying\nhow many people can download or\n\n454\n00:22:58.238 --> 00:23:01.350\ne-mail me if there's too many\nconnections and stuff like that.\n\n455\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.722\nBut that's the availability.\n\n456\n00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:05.150\nSo basically they're not saying hey,\nyou're gonna do this.\n\n457\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:05.974\nYou probably wont.\n\n458\n00:23:05.974 --> 00:23:08.146\nBut the fact is the capability is here.\n\n459\n00:23:08.146 --> 00:23:10.937\nThe capability of this\nproduct is incredible.\n\n460\n00:23:10.937 --> 00:23:12.888\nI think you've seen that over\nthe last couple of days.\n\n461\n00:23:12.888 --> 00:23:14.018\n>> It's pretty powerful.\n\n462\n00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.759\nAl lright, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's a pretty good spot for\n\n463\n00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:19.497\nus to wrap up our correlation policies,\nour white list, you know,\n\n464\n00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:20.763\na lot of that good stuff there.\n\n465\n00:23:20.763 --> 00:23:22.409\nDefinitely complex.\nYou'd probably have to go back and\n\n466\n00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:25.507\nwatch these episodes more than one\nonce to make sure you got it all.\n\n467\n00:23:25.507 --> 00:23:28.424\nBut in real life land the skies the limit.\n\n468\n00:23:28.424 --> 00:23:31.199\nIt really comes down to your creativity\nand what rules you wanna create for\n\n469\n00:23:31.199 --> 00:23:31.967\nyour environment.\n\n470\n00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:35.938\nSo that's a pretty good spot for us to\nwrap this one up, so we'll do just that.\n\n471\n00:23:35.938 --> 00:23:38.558\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n472\n00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:40.012\n>> And I'm Todd Langley, thank you.\n\n473\n00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:41.103\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n474\n00:23:41.103 --> 00:23:48.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
