          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.231\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:08.720\nHello everyone, I'm Kate Byars.\n\n3\n00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.536\nWhat I'd like to share with you today is\nsomething I call the iconic marketing\n\n4\n00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:14.140\nmethod.\n\n5\n00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.743\nWe wanna talk about five unconventional\npillars of effective marketing,\n\n6\n00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:21.515\nand I wanna challenge everyone in the room\nto think about marketing a little bit\n\n7\n00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.273\ndifferently.\n\n8\n00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.229\n[COUGH] Typically,\n\n9\n00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:26.764\nwhen we think about marketing we\nthink about the product mix, right?\n\n10\n00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.500\nWe have to have a product.\n\n11\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.559\nWe have to have a place to\nsell our product or service.\n\n12\n00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.672\nWe also need to promote it in some way.\n\n13\n00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:38.014\nWe have to create awareness\naround what we're doing.\n\n14\n00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:41.086\nAnd finally, we need to have a price.\n\n15\n00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:44.653\nThe one place where everyone gets\nreally caught up in marketing, usually,\n\n16\n00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:46.100\nis in the promotion piece, and\n\n17\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.576\nthat's a little bit of what I'm hearing\nin some of your questions today.\n\n18\n00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:50.415\nHow do I promote it?\n\n19\n00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:54.101\nHow do I know that money I'm spending\non my marketing is gonna be effective?\n\n20\n00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.029\nShould I be on LinkedIn?\n\n21\n00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:56.301\nShould I be on Facebook?\n\n22\n00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.218\nHow do I use social, inbound,\noutbound, traditional?\n\n23\n00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:03.391\nIt is just this word cloud of tons of\ntechniques, but that's all they are.\n\n24\n00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:08.839\nThose are techniques, and those we can\nnarrow down and make those effective.\n\n25\n00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:12.805\nThe other thing we'll see companies\ndo sometimes is when we get stuck and\n\n26\n00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.146\nwe're not seeing the growth we wanna see,\n\n27\n00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.765\nwe start to play around\nwith the marketing mix.\n\n28\n00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:19.336\nMaybe we need a higher-level product.\n\n29\n00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:22.412\nMaybe we need a more inexpensive product.\n\n30\n00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:23.315\nMaybe I should be online.\n\n31\n00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:24.194\nMaybe I should be inline.\n\n32\n00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:25.621\nShould I go international?\n\n33\n00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:30.561\nWe start messing around with the product\nmix a lot of times a little bit too\n\n34\n00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.892\nsoon before we get a really\ngood foundation set.\n\n35\n00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:37.238\nSo what I wanna introduce to\nyou today is that foundation.\n\n36\n00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:40.372\nI call it the Iconic Brand Foundation.\n\n37\n00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.225\nSo, what does this mean?\n\n38\n00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:45.661\nWell, first of all, it means that\nwe're starting with iconic intent.\n\n39\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.813\nSo let me tell you a little bit\nof a story on my background and\n\n40\n00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:51.032\nhow I discovered this.\n\n41\n00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:53.749\nI started my career in advertising,\nand I worked for\n\n42\n00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.891\nseveral different large advertising\nagencies on brands that were really big,\n\n43\n00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:01.134\nlike Quaker State Motor Oil,\nor Pepsi, huge global brands.\n\n44\n00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:04.166\nAnd I also had the opportunity to work for\nsmaller brands.\n\n45\n00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.231\nAt the time, I was in Texas.\n\n46\n00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.756\nThey were regional, Mrs.\n\n47\n00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:11.740\nBaird's bread, Imperial sugar, McIlhenny\nTabasco Sauce, family owned companies.\n\n48\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.385\nAnd we had a lot of fun in our ad agency\nputting together these amazing strategies\n\n49\n00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:18.406\nand these incredible campaigns.\n\n50\n00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:21.819\nAnd we'd launch them, and the clients\nwould be happy cuz sales would go up.\n\n51\n00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.747\nYay, everybody's happy, right?\n\n52\n00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.597\nAnd then, the next year, we would do\nanother incredible strategy session.\n\n53\n00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:29.963\nWe do more amazing advertising campaigns,\nand\n\n54\n00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:33.759\nwe'd launch them, and meh,\nnot much would happen.\n\n55\n00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.280\nAnd there seemed to be this constant\nup and down with this advertising.\n\n56\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.179\nAnd what I noticed is that, if you're\na company like Pepsi or Quaker State,\n\n57\n00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.102\nyou can throw more money at this problem,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:46.579\nAnd you can solve that problem to get\nyour sales to where you need them to be.\n\n59\n00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.671\nIf you're a smaller company like a Mrs.\n\n60\n00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:52.071\nBaird's Bread that I was working with,\nthat was it for the year.\n\n61\n00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.958\nThere was no more money to spend.\n\n62\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.049\nAnd I thought, wow, that's really a shame.\n\n63\n00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.817\nThere's gotta be a way to figure this out.\n\n64\n00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:58.980\nThere's gotta be a better way.\n\n65\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.080\nNow, if anyone's ever worked in ad agency\nbusiness before, you know that you're\n\n66\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.640\nprobably working 16-hour days, and\nyou have really crazy deadlines.\n\n67\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.810\nAnd after four years of that, I was like,\nokay, maybe there's another way to work\n\n68\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.790\nwhere I'm not working that long, and\nalso where I can be more effective.\n\n69\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.988\nSo I went to work for\nthis lady, Mary Kay Ash, and\n\n70\n00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:23.465\nI started working inside the company as\na corporate marketer in her organization.\n\n71\n00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.048\nNow I took with me, to Mary Kay,\n\n72\n00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:27.930\nall of that frenetic energy\nthat you have in advertising.\n\n73\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.454\nDeadlines, client demands,\nI need to go, go, go.\n\n74\n00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:35.301\nAnd about there weeks into my\nbrand new job at Mary Kay,\n\n75\n00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:39.829\nI had been hired to be part of\na small team of functional experts.\n\n76\n00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.462\nMy functional expertise was marketing.\n\n77\n00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:45.330\nI had someone else on the team who was\nin finance, someone else in operations.\n\n78\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.860\nAnd we were gonna go to Mary Kay's\ninternational subsidiaries and\n\n79\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.377\nhelp them grow their sales.\n\n80\n00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:54.870\nAt that time, Mary Kay's international had\nreally grown through that sort of cocktail\n\n81\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.100\nnapkin syndrome, where somebody says,\nI know a guy in Spain.\n\n82\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.589\nAll right, send him some product.\n\n83\n00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.002\nLet's see what can happen.\n\n84\n00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:04.001\nAnd obviously, that's not a very\neffective way to grow your company.\n\n85\n00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.227\nSo our team was charged for going over,\n\n86\n00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:09.680\nworking with the people who\nwere the local market experts.\n\n87\n00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.185\nThey knew their business\nreally well on the ground, and\n\n88\n00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.116\nwe had that functional expertise to help.\n\n89\n00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:17.669\nAnyways, three weeks in, I walk in\nthe lobby, and here's what I see.\n\n90\n00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.239\nBeautiful pink and black balloons.\n\n91\n00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.390\nWe're having a party, nice.\n\n92\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.920\nI go in the elevator up to my office,\nand there's a sign,\n\n93\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.490\n10 AM, Mary Kay's birthday,\nplease join us in the atrium.\n\n94\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.060\nOkay, that's cool, because in advertising\nyou don't stop to have birthday cake\n\n95\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.330\nuntil midnight, when you've\nalready missed lunch and dinner.\n\n96\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.040\nSo the last thing I was\ngonna do was come down and\n\n97\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.630\nmiss my 10 o'clock meeting\nthat I had called.\n\n98\n00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:43.394\n10 o'clock,\nI go to my meeting in the conference room.\n\n99\n00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:46.283\n10:02, hm, no one shows up.\n\n100\n00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:48.451\n10:05, what kind people\nwork at this company?\n\n101\n00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:50.886\nDon't they show up for\ntheir meetings on time?\n\n102\n00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:52.853\nNobody showed up for my meeting.\n\n103\n00:04:52.853 --> 00:04:53.861\nI was incensed.\n\n104\n00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:57.555\nAnd so I walked out to\nthe little glass banister there,\n\n105\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.265\nand I looked down into the atrium,\nand look what I saw.\n\n106\n00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:05.063\n1,500 of my colleagues were\njammed into this atrium\n\n107\n00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:08.790\nalong with a whole slew of\nMary Kay Beauty Consultants.\n\n108\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.890\nI had to get down there and\nsee what was going on.\n\n109\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.518\nSomething was different cuz\nthis was just birthday cake.\n\n110\n00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:20.399\nAs I stepped out of the elevator, and\nI was shoulder to shoulder with all of\n\n111\n00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.809\nthese people [COUGH], Mary Kay Ash\nstepped down onto a balcony, and\n\n112\n00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.840\nliterally everyone in\nthe room fell silent.\n\n113\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.615\nAnd when Mary Kay Ash started to speak,\nI will never forget this moment,\n\n114\n00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.446\ncuz it taught me such an important lesson.\n\n115\n00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:38.504\nShe did not come out in the balcony and\nsay, hey everyone, thanks for\n\n116\n00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.055\nthe coming for the birthday cake.\n\n117\n00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:42.208\nI really appreciate you being here.\n\n118\n00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.660\nThank you for helping make this\ncompany grow to a billion dollars.\n\n119\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.207\nWe wouldn't have done it without you.\n\n120\n00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:49.764\nWhich would have been a very\nnice thing to say, right?\n\n121\n00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:53.121\nA lot of us as leaders might\nmake a speech like that.\n\n122\n00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:56.041\nInstead, Mary Kay came out in\nthat balcony and she said, and\n\n123\n00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.323\nI swear she was looking just at me,\nand everyone else felt that way.\n\n124\n00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:05.350\nShe goes, I believe in you, and\nI believe in you, and I believe in you.\n\n125\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.870\nAnd you have the power to make\nyour dreams come true, and\n\n126\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.060\nI know it cuz I've seen you do it before,\nand I'm here, and I'm gonna help you.\n\n127\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.430\nAnd whatever it is that you dream about\nin life, we're gonna make that come true.\n\n128\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.849\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n129\n00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.106\nShe did not talk about her.\n\n130\n00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:21.920\nShe did not talk about her company.\n\n131\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.259\nShe talked about me.\n\n132\n00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.192\nAnd I thought, man if we could bottle\nthat, and we could take that overseas,\n\n133\n00:06:27.192 --> 00:06:29.000\nthat's what we need to be doing.\n\n134\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.398\nAnd that's what I began\nto learn at Mary Kay.\n\n135\n00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:36.660\nBecause Mary Kay started her\ncompany with a piece of paper.\n\n136\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.404\nAnd her ambition was not to\ncreate a global cosmetic company.\n\n137\n00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:45.949\nHer ambition was to enrich the lives of\nwomen, and that's what she wanted to do.\n\n138\n00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:51.192\nBecause Mary Kay knew, as a single mother,\nas a working mom, how hard it was,\n\n139\n00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:55.887\nhow few opportunities women had\nback in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n140\n00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:59.840\nSo she didn't start her company to\nbecome a billion dollar company.\n\n141\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.852\nShe started her company to\nenrich the lives of women, and\n\n142\n00:07:02.852 --> 00:07:05.005\nthat is their mission statement today.\n\n143\n00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:10.594\nSo we took that mission statement, and\nwe took what I was learning at Mary Kay,\n\n144\n00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:14.673\nthis Iconic Brand Concept,\noverseas, and guess what?\n\n145\n00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:18.600\nWe grew a lot of international business,\nand we did so profitably.\n\n146\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.223\nProfits went up 3% to\n10% across the board.\n\n147\n00:07:21.223 --> 00:07:24.745\nThat's cash to your bottom line that\nyou can use to grow your business.\n\n148\n00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:25.360\nThat's fun.\n\n149\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.134\nOkay, what does it mean to be iconic?\n\n150\n00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:33.635\nUsually, when I start talking about\niconic, people are like, Kate, Starbucks,\n\n151\n00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:35.499\nApple, UPS, huge, huge brands.\n\n152\n00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:36.451\nI'm not a big brand.\n\n153\n00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:39.696\nI don't have that money\nto buy being iconic.\n\n154\n00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:41.016\nYou don't have to buy being iconic.\n\n155\n00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:45.428\nIconic just means that your brand is\nidentified as having aspects that\n\n156\n00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:48.740\ncontribute to the customer's\nself-expression.\n\n157\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.060\nJust like Mary Kay spoke to me that day on\nthat balcony, that's what these brands do.\n\n158\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.766\nTheir message is never about them.\n\n159\n00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:00.284\nTheir message is about the consumer,\nand that is why they're iconic and\n\n160\n00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:03.110\nthat is why they have such\nstrong brand allegiance.\n\n161\n00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.160\nThey make lifetime customers,\nthey have very high retention rate, and\n\n162\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.810\nthat is a really profitable\nway to run your business.\n\n163\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.230\nWe want customers who\ngive us word of mouth.\n\n164\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.755\nWe want customers who\ncome back repeatedly, and\n\n165\n00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:16.487\nwe want customers referring us.\n\n166\n00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:19.260\nThat's all these iconic brands have.\n\n167\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.380\nSo Starbucks, great example.\n\n168\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.852\nStarbucks doesn't necessarily\nhave a great cup of coffee.\n\n169\n00:08:25.852 --> 00:08:28.135\nA lot of people would argue that, right?\n\n170\n00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:32.160\nAnd a lot of people would say its\noverpriced, but why do we go to Starbucks?\n\n171\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.981\nBecause they set out to\nhave a great cup of coffee?\n\n172\n00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.417\nNo, Starbucks set out to be a third place,\n\n173\n00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:39.870\ncuz Howard Schultz knew when\nhe was traveling around Italy,\n\n174\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.010\nhe saw all these Italians communing\nin the middle of the day.\n\n175\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.865\nAnd they were at these coffee shops and\nthese bistros and they were enjoying\n\n176\n00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:51.790\nthe camaraderie and he said we need that,\nwe need that in our country.\n\n177\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.470\nBecause we have become so\nbusy running and running and running,\n\n178\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.160\nwe don't have that third place to stop\nin the middle of our busy day and\n\n179\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.830\nisn't that what he's given us?\n\n180\n00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.200\nThat's what it is, so\nwe identify with that.\n\n181\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.740\nIt's not about the great cup of coffee.\n\n182\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.250\nThat sounds great, Kate,\nlet's all go be an iconic brand.\n\n183\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.689\nReally what are the advantages?\n\n184\n00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:14.698\nFirst of all, you're gonna enjoy\na higher return on investment for\n\n185\n00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:17.525\nevery marketing dollar you spend,\nall right?\n\n186\n00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:20.700\nThat's nice because we want\nour marketing to be effective.\n\n187\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.940\nWhat's effective marketing?\n\n188\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.910\nMarketing that works.\n\n189\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.860\nYou're also going to underspend on\nadvertising versus the competition.\n\n190\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.050\nWho do you think spends\nmore on advertising?\n\n191\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.830\nApple, Microsoft, or Dell?\n\n192\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.680\nDell?\n\n193\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.810\nDell first, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.310\nWho's second?\n\n195\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.160\nMicrosoft and then Apple,\nApple's an iconic brand.\n\n196\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.120\nHow many of us are wearing a Dell watch?\n\n197\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.820\nWould you buy a Dell watch?\n\n198\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.580\nNo, Dell's a computer company,\nwhy would I do that?\n\n199\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.080\nWait, Apple's a computer company,\nwe buy Apple watches.\n\n200\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.360\nDo you see the difference?\n\n201\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.814\nWhen you're an iconic brand and\nwhen you have that customer enraptured and\n\n202\n00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:03.845\nyou're speaking for the customer, Apple\ncould make toasters and we would by them.\n\n203\n00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:07.845\nAnd we be okay with that wouldn't we,\nit might be a pretty cool toaster too.\n\n204\n00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:10.966\nYou're gonna get wildly loyal\ncustomers who will become word of\n\n205\n00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:12.620\nmouth referral machines.\n\n206\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.150\nOur biggest problem at Mary Kay was not\nbringing more customers in the door,\n\n207\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.744\nit was serving the customers we had.\n\n208\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.410\nThat's a great problem.\n\n209\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.620\nThe other thing that is a phenomenal\nadvantage is you get a united\n\n210\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.770\ninternal culture that\nattracts like-minded people.\n\n211\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.470\nWe don't have to motivate our team.\n\n212\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.040\nWe're not spending all this time going\nhow do I get my team to work harder?\n\n213\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.580\nHow do I get my team to show up?\n\n214\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.630\nHow do I get my team\nto think of new ideas?\n\n215\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.810\nThey're excited to come to work everyday\nbecause they believe what you believe and\n\n216\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.540\ncompany resources are gonna\ngo towards serving loyalty.\n\n217\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.430\nLike I said at Mary Kay, it's the most\nwonderful thing for me to see is when you\n\n218\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.650\ngo from chasing sales to serving\ncustomers who are willingly there.\n\n219\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.090\nIt's a huge pivot, it's an exciting pivot\nand it's a much more profitable pivot to\n\n220\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.490\nhave because when customers\nare excited about you and\n\n221\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.570\nthey identify with you, they're\nalready out there talking about you.\n\n222\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.760\nWe're gonna see some of those today.\n\n223\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.473\nAnd finally, it's just more fun,\nwe all want our businesses to grow but\n\n224\n00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:12.425\ndon't we also wanna have fun doing it?\n\n225\n00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:14.867\nLet's start talking about the pillars.\n\n226\n00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:18.018\nAnd guys, I should say, I want this\nto be an interactive presentation so\n\n227\n00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:20.820\nwe're gonna go over pillar one and\nthen everyone has a handout.\n\n228\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.432\nWe're gonna fill out some\nstuff on the handouts.\n\n229\n00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:28.032\nDon't panic, you don't have to look at it\nyet but I want this to be interactive, so\n\n230\n00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:30.830\nask questions, interrupt,\nwhatever you need.\n\n231\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.242\nThe very first thing we have to\ndo is to find our rally cry.\n\n232\n00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:35.187\nNow you guys have all\nheard of Simon Sinek.\n\n233\n00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:38.153\nI know this group is pretty\nfamiliar with Simon Sinek.\n\n234\n00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:41.170\nSo, I'm not going to try to\nout Simon Sinek, Simon Sinek.\n\n235\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.310\nBut we all know that what he\nlearned through his research\n\n236\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.620\nis that great leaders and great companies,\nthe way they get people to follow them\n\n237\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.640\nis he understood that people do not buy\nwhat you do, they buy why you do it.\n\n238\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.670\nThey don't buy what you do,\nthey buy why you do it.\n\n239\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.280\nWhen we're thinking of\nmarketing our companies,\n\n240\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.880\nwe have to stop marketing up here and\nwe have to start marketing here.\n\n241\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.990\nWhen we start touching people emotionally\nto where they can't even say, I can't\n\n242\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.120\neven tell you why I like to go there, they\nwill always come back to the logic but\n\n243\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.960\nthat's not what grabs them,\nit's the emotion.\n\n244\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.500\nLet's take a look at\nan example from Simon Sinek.\n\n245\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.740\nMost companies if they were Apple,\nwhat would they say?\n\n246\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.857\nWe make great computers,\nthey're user friendly,\n\n247\n00:12:30.857 --> 00:12:35.054\nbeautifully designed, and\neasy to use, wanna buy one?\n\n248\n00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.955\nNah, maybe, I don't know,\nlet me see what kind of computer you got.\n\n249\n00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:38.760\nWhat kind of computer you got?\n\n250\n00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.090\nDo you see what happens?\n\n251\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.307\nWhen you start with what you do,\nwhere does my mind go?\n\n252\n00:12:43.307 --> 00:12:46.430\nTo logic, I'm already looking at pricing\nand features and I'm comparing you.\n\n253\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.480\nNow, this is what Apple does.\n\n254\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.330\nWith everything we do,\nwe aim to challenge the status quo.\n\n255\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.740\nWe aim to think differently.\n\n256\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.020\nOur products are user friendly,\nbeautifully designed, and easy to use.\n\n257\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.918\nHave I told you what he sells yet?\n\n258\n00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:04.930\nNo, and then you say,\nwe just happen to make great computers.\n\n259\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.520\nWant to buy one?\n\n260\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.200\nNow I'm inspired, now I'm like, yeah,\n\n261\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.140\nI want something user friendly and\nyeah, I challenge the status quo, and\n\n262\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.980\nI believe in that, so\nI'm identifying with that as a customer.\n\n263\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.320\nA lot of us, if we've heard of\nSimon Sinek and we understand the why and\n\n264\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.130\nwe know we're supposed to have\na why which translates to a mission\n\n265\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.420\nstatement which some of you were\nworking on, how do you get there?\n\n266\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.940\nHow you get there is if\nyou're the company founder,\n\n267\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.680\nyou have to go back through your life,\nyour childhood, and\n\n268\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.660\nunderstand all these different things in\nlife that have created who you are today.\n\n269\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.690\nBecause you are living and\n\n270\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.170\nwalking your why right now, you may\njust not know exactly what that is.\n\n271\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.430\nWhat a lot of people wanna do is they\nwanna start with why I started my company\n\n272\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.150\nis this and you gotta go back way\nback before you started your company.\n\n273\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.940\nLet me give you a couple examples.\n\n274\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.180\nReal estate company here in town,\n\n275\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.380\nI started working with them a couple\nyears ago and they were stuck and\n\n276\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.350\nthey were trying to figuring out how\nto get to the next level of growth.\n\n277\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.400\nAnd I said, what are you about?\n\n278\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.110\nWhat do you care about?\n\n279\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.930\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\n280\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.460\nI don't know,\nwe just like helping people and\n\n281\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.730\nwe like selling our product and\nall this normal stuff people would say.\n\n282\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.360\nI'm like, no, no, no,\nwhat do you care about?\n\n283\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.890\nWhat's really important to you?\n\n284\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.080\nI said tell me about you childhood.\n\n285\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.758\nThe founder of this company,\nshe says I had a pretty normal childhood.\n\n286\n00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:26.746\nI was the oldest of several siblings and\nI raised my siblings in many ways.\n\n287\n00:14:26.746 --> 00:14:29.250\nI was busy babysitting them and\ndiapering them and\n\n288\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.047\nmaking sure they were getting fed.\n\n289\n00:14:31.047 --> 00:14:33.314\nAnd I was like, okay, well,\nthat's a little unusual,\n\n290\n00:14:33.314 --> 00:14:36.100\nnot everyone has had that\nexperience in their childhood.\n\n291\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.390\nI was a good student in school,\nI liked to play sports.\n\n292\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.930\nShe told us about all the normal stuff.\n\n293\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.930\nAnd then, she said, in high school,\n\n294\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.230\nI would volunteer at a therapeutic\nriding center, and I would help children\n\n295\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.100\nwho were unable to walk ride these\nhorses and it was part of their therapy.\n\n296\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.610\nI thought, that's different,\ncuz in high school,\n\n297\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.812\nthat was the last thing I was doing.\n\n298\n00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.280\n[LAUGH] And then she went on to say,\nin college,\n\n299\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.180\nhow much she loved being\npart of her sorority.\n\n300\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.850\nThey would do all these little fun things\nwhere they would almost trick-or-treat\n\n301\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.820\npeople and leave them little surprises.\n\n302\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.750\nAnd I'm like,\nthat didn't resonate with me either.\n\n303\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.640\nThere was a theme there, so do you see\nthe theme that's happening in her life?\n\n304\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.200\nShe really cares about\nreaching out to people.\n\n305\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.600\nAnd I said, when you do things for\npeople, what is that like?\n\n306\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.340\nShe goes,\nyou can do the smallest little thing and\n\n307\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.600\nI think it has a ripple effect\nacross everybody's life.\n\n308\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.690\nI was like, bingo,\nwe've just found your why.\n\n309\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.120\nHere's what the why became for\nthis real estate company.\n\n310\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.349\nIn everything we do,\nwe believe in helping others.\n\n311\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.260\nWe believe that no deed goes unnoticed and\n\n312\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.140\neven the smallest gesture can bring\njoy to another person's life.\n\n313\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.438\nThe way we help others is by\nlistening to their needs and\n\n314\n00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:50.327\ndoing everything we can to help meet those\nneeds, no matter how big or how small.\n\n315\n00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:52.852\nWe just happened to be a real estate firm.\n\n316\n00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.063\nAnd when she began embracing this why,\n\n317\n00:15:55.063 --> 00:15:58.682\nher company culture changed\nThe people in her company changed.\n\n318\n00:15:58.682 --> 00:16:01.920\nMany left,\nmany didn't want to be a part of this.\n\n319\n00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.060\nThis was not their why.\n\n320\n00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.900\nThey didn't wanna do nice little\nthings for their customers.\n\n321\n00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.050\nNot because they didn't care, but\nthey were in it for something else.\n\n322\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.744\nThey automatically left the company.\n\n323\n00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:14.750\nThe way she approaches her customers, the\nway she approaches her hiring practices,\n\n324\n00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.530\nthe way they answer the phone,\nthe way they've redone their website.\n\n325\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.956\nEverything that's happened is\nnow in-tune with this why.\n\n326\n00:16:19.956 --> 00:16:25.020\nTheir mission is not to be the number\none real estate company in the world.\n\n327\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.430\nTheir mission is to bring care and\n\n328\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.115\ndelight to one of the most significant\nmoments in people's lives.\n\n329\n00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:31.715\nOkay, what was Mary Kay's mission?\n\n330\n00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:33.925\nEnriching the lives of women.\n\n331\n00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:38.800\nMary Kay could have been reached the lives\nof women with pencils or bulldozers.\n\n332\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.150\nCosmetics is not the point,\nthat was just the tool.\n\n333\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.380\nSo for this company, real estate's just\nthe tool, guys, to meet this mission.\n\n334\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.330\nAnd she's gonna carry this mission no\nmatter what kind of business she has, and\n\n335\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.180\nher business can be as broad\nas she needs it to be.\n\n336\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.790\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n337\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.780\nAll right, let's do one more and\nthen we're gonna work on yours.\n\n338\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.460\nBiotechnology firm.\n\n339\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.222\nAgain, here I'm meeting with\nthis biotechnology firm.\n\n340\n00:17:01.222 --> 00:17:03.980\nThey say, we have this product and\nit's amazing.\n\n341\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.880\nIt is going to help people\nwho have digestive issues.\n\n342\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.190\nSo there's these different enzymes and\n\n343\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.320\nthings that some people\nhave a hard time digesting.\n\n344\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.020\nI'm probably not representing\nthis as well as they could.\n\n345\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.880\nBut we're gonna make food products that,\nwhen they eat this food product,\n\n346\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.330\nthey can start eating a more normal diet.\n\n347\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.700\nI'm like, wow, that's really beautiful.\n\n348\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.980\nWhy are you doing it through\nthis food product route?\n\n349\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.630\nWhy not pharmaceuticals?\n\n350\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.340\nBecause this company could make so\n\n351\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.970\nmuch more money if they did\nthe pharmaceutical route, right?\n\n352\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.900\nThey could develop a pill,\nthey could market that pill,\n\n353\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.260\nthey could market medications.\n\n354\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.290\nThe insurance companies would pay for\nit and they could become bajillionaires.\n\n355\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:36.790\nWhy not?\n\n356\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.100\nWhat's your why?\n\n357\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.310\nWhy do you care so much about this?\n\n358\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.360\nWell, we wanna help people.\n\n359\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.000\nYeah, I know, we all wanna help people.\n\n360\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.590\nWhat's your why?\n\n361\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.490\nAnd as I started talking\nto these company founders,\n\n362\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.750\none of the things that came out\nis that one of the founders,\n\n363\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.710\nas he grew up he was put on\nwhat he called the short bus.\n\n364\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.690\nRight?\n\n365\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.330\nHe was treated differently than other\nchildren for a time, not as the brilliant\n\n366\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.880\nand incredible man that he is,\nbecause he has a slight speech impediment.\n\n367\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.010\nWow.\n\n368\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.550\nSo does he understand what\nit's like to be different?\n\n369\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.790\nDoes he understand what\nit's like to be excluded?\n\n370\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.730\nSo is it no wonder that these people, this\nvery small population of people in the US\n\n371\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.760\nthat the pharmaceutical companies\nwon't pay attention to,\n\n372\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.860\nbecause they're not profitable enough,\nhe's going to go help?\n\n373\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.000\nDo you see how that ties\ninto just what he's doing?\n\n374\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.370\nHe was doing that automatically\nbefore his why was ever defined, but\n\n375\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.660\nnow that it's defined,\nhe's going to be able to take that,\n\n376\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.000\nand he's going to be able\nto hire the right people.\n\n377\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.220\nHe's going to be able to create\na marketing message, and\n\n378\n00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.370\nthe marketing platforms that he needs\nthat's gonna serve these people well.\n\n379\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.460\nSo their why is that in everything we do,\nwe believe people are all the same.\n\n380\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.370\nRight?\n\n381\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.600\nIt doesn't matter if you\nhave a speech impediment,\n\n382\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.530\nit doesn't matter if you\ncan't eat the same foods.\n\n383\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.780\nWe're the same, and\n\n384\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.080\nwe believe that everyone deserves\na life without judgement.\n\n385\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.595\nThe way we help others is\nthrough scientific research and\n\n386\n00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:56.090\na relentless pursuit of innovation.\n\n387\n00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.429\nWe just happen to produce\nspecialized food products.\n\n388\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.590\nAnd their mission is we offer choices for\nthose with nutritional limits.\n\n389\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.850\nThat's beautiful, and that has opened\nthe door for him to develop so\n\n390\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.890\nmany products and so\nmany services surrounding that.\n\n391\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.650\nOkay, so we have our why.\n\n392\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.590\nYay, those are hard to\ncome up with sometimes.\n\n393\n00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.940\nWe are excited, what do we do with it?\n\n394\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.820\nWhat a lot of people do is to put it\non our about us page on their website.\n\n395\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.350\nThat's great and that's a good place to\nhave it but we need it everywhere, right?\n\n396\n00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.400\nAnd hopefully,\nyou heard me talking about Mary Kay and\n\n397\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.610\nthese other companies,\nit's in your hiring practices.\n\n398\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.730\nIt's in your memo,\n\n399\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.660\nit's in your e-mail signature, it's in\nhow you start your company meanings.\n\n400\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.370\nIt's in how you greet people,\nit's in your 30 second elevator speech.\n\n401\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.350\nYet Mary Kay, one of the things that she\nhad throughout the entire company is\n\n402\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.680\nwhen someone ask you how you're doing,\nguess what's the answer was?\n\n403\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.120\nGreat.\n\n404\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.930\nShe's like, you gotta fake it till you\nmake it, and that's what you said.\n\n405\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.590\nAnd there never was a person in the\nhistory of the seven years that I worked\n\n406\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.818\nfor that company who ever said\nanything other than great.\n\n407\n00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.250\nCuz she said you know what,\n\n408\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.800\nnobody cares that your dog got run over\nby a car this morning, they really don't.\n\n409\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.690\nBut that attitude that\nshe had of belief and\n\n410\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.910\nempowering people, it came out in so\nmany small ways about that company.\n\n411\n00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.780\nSo guys, this is all about igniting your\ntribe, both internally and externally.\n\n412\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.960\nOkay, so\nlet's take a little break there and\n\n413\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.100\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna turn to\nthe handouts you have in front of you.\n\n414\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.910\nSome of you are working\non mission statements.\n\n415\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.090\nSome of you are working on your why.\n\n416\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.370\nLet's get some dialogue going.\n\n417\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.410\nLet's take a couple of minutes and\nlook at, on the front\n\n418\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.350\npage if you don't have your why,\nit's gonna ask you a couple of questions.\n\n419\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.870\nYou need to be the company\nfounder to do this or\n\n420\n00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.510\nyou need to know something\nabout the company founder.\n\n421\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.320\nIt's gonna ask you to think about some\nreally soapbox moments you've had\n\n422\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.620\nin your childhood, your youth,\nthat helped you create your company.\n\n423\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.980\nWhy do you care so much about what you do?\n\n424\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.270\nAnd if you already have that,\nyou can turn to the second page,\n\n425\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.680\nwhich talks about your mission\nstatement and what you can do with it.\n\n426\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.150\nAnybody wanna share?\n\n427\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.460\nYou guys look like you've\nbeen doing some work.\n\n428\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.220\n&gt;&gt; We just kinda went through this.\n\n429\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.688\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Where people ask me what we do.\n\n430\n00:20:59.688 --> 00:21:03.380\nA few weeks ago,\nI said I have a machine shop.\n\n431\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.076\nWe've got a machine that\ndoes stainless steel and\n\n432\n00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:12.092\nwe do sell it to the high backing\nindustry, in this case the vacuum is\n\n433\n00:21:12.092 --> 00:21:17.030\nused in various industries such as and\nthin film, solar.\n\n434\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.199\nAnd it was always hard to\ntell people what we did and\n\n435\n00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:27.662\nwe just kinda as I mentioned on the\nreport, we just got through this process.\n\n436\n00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:31.706\nAnd they helped us come up with\nempowering, transformative science and\n\n437\n00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:33.320\ntechnology.\n\n438\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.080\nAnd it took me a little bit to warm up\nto the word transformative until he did\n\n439\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.606\na little more research on it.\n\n440\n00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:42.096\nMaybe you can speak more about that,\nabout whether it is actual or real,\n\n441\n00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:43.940\nit's not just a big vocabulary word.\n\n442\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.767\n&gt;&gt; Our customers are scientists and\nengineers working in these tech companies.\n\n443\n00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.732\nAnd transformative technology or\n\n444\n00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:56.480\ntransformative science is actually defined\nby the National Science Foundation.\n\n445\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.005\nIt's a specific thing,\n&gt;&gt; So that term is meaningful to them.\n\n446\n00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:05.363\n&gt;&gt; It literally is science and tech\nthat changes the way people do things.\n\n447\n00:22:05.363 --> 00:22:08.555\nAnd the big example is that hyper loop,\n\n448\n00:22:08.555 --> 00:22:13.799\nwhere they're creating a vacuum\ntube to transport materials.\n\n449\n00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.710\nThey've been a customer of ours for\nthree years.\n\n450\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.000\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you're kidding.\n\n451\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.670\n&gt;&gt; There is like major headline stuff\n\n452\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.040\nwhen you click the Google-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n453\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.141\n&gt;&gt; On your newsfeed about the hyperlink,\nwe helped create\n\n454\n00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:31.530\nthat in a little machine shop and\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n455\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.880\nThat has to feel great.\n\n456\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.080\nOkay, so that's is that your mission\nstatement or that's what you do?\n\n457\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.830\n&gt;&gt; That's been our current\nmission statements that we're\n\n458\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.510\nempowering the transition.\n\n459\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.400\n&gt;&gt; Empowering, okay.\n\n460\n00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.020\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; We're hardware guys.\n\n461\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.132\nAnd it doesn't make it more clear to us,\nbecause we have some products.\n\n462\n00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:49.200\nWe have a particular product right now\nthat is the best product in the world\n\n463\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.230\nin this application, and\nthat's what's really driving us.\n\n464\n00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.520\nBut this makes it more clear to us,\nthis is who we are.\n\n465\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.050\nThis is what we want to be.\n\n466\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.920\nAnd now we're looking at the acquisition\nof another product that's the best in\n\n467\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.880\nthe world at what it does.\n\n468\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.670\nJust a small guy, who's a great guy\nthat designed it nut he doesn't have\n\n469\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.040\nthe marketing and the manufacturing and\nall that to really make it happen and\n\n470\n00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.350\nhe just wants somebody to take it and\nrun with it.\n\n471\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:18.383\nSo it does,\nI'm pretty excited at the moment cuz in\n\n472\n00:23:18.383 --> 00:23:20.290\nmy opinion we are clearly fine [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n473\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.410\nAnd is it the word transformative and\nbest?\n\n474\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.440\nLike, what do you care about,\nwhat's your, what's your passion?\n\n475\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.480\nWhat is it like, if I took those words\naway from you, how would you feel?\n\n476\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.790\n&gt;&gt; If you took the words away from?\n\n477\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:36.000\nI mean it's always been\ntrying to get customer focus.\n\n478\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.974\nWe've always tried to be, when that person\nmakes the phone call to our customer\n\n479\n00:23:41.974 --> 00:23:47.608\nservice people that they get more than\njust a part number that we give them.\n\n480\n00:23:47.608 --> 00:23:51.072\nWe spend a lot of time in training\nto help them if they think\n\n481\n00:23:51.072 --> 00:23:54.681\nthat they're [INAUDIBLE] help this person,\nso I mean to me,\n\n482\n00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.315\nwe Excited about having these products\nthat they can't get anywhere else.\n\n483\n00:23:59.315 --> 00:24:02.819\nThat's really gonna help them in their\nprocess in what they're trying to do.\n\n484\n00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:06.794\nAnd between all the different industries\nthat could be a lot of different\n\n485\n00:24:06.794 --> 00:24:07.520\nprocesses.\n\n486\n00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.512\nAnd I'm just a business major so\nI go to some of these trade shows and\n\n487\n00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:13.576\ntalk to these scientist guys there,\nand they start talking to you.\n\n488\n00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:15.595\nIt's exciting, but\nsomething that's gonna go over your head.\n\n489\n00:24:15.595 --> 00:24:16.366\n&gt;&gt; A little overwhelming.\n\n490\n00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:19.130\nYeah, okay, so these are all good.\n\n491\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.370\nSo this is all you guys are defining.\n\n492\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.190\nWhat I'm trying to get\nto is a piece up here.\n\n493\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.000\nI want your pie in the sky, your clouds.\n\n494\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.455\nWhat do you care about?\n\n495\n00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:28.842\nIn other words, it's great you\nhave good customer service and\n\n496\n00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:31.450\nyou're approaching your\nbusiness in a different way.\n\n497\n00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.000\nThat's the piece we wanna figure out.\n\n498\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.280\nBecause there's scientists out\nthere who believe a certain way.\n\n499\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.311\nNow, they're scientists,\nof course they're innovative, right?\n\n500\n00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.110\nThey're in the sciences.\n\n501\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.610\nIs it the best,\nis it that we want to excel, and\n\n502\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.850\nif you have to have the very best science\nin order to have the very best result?\n\n503\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.870\nBecause if we really care how\npassionate about, whatever that is,\n\n504\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.400\nexcellence, then you are gonna attract\nscientists who care about excellence.\n\n505\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.340\nIf you really care about,\ntrying to think of something different.\n\n506\n00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.940\nIf you really care about doing\na thorough job, I don't know,\n\n507\n00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.330\nthere's gonna be scientists out there who\nare all about no, it needs to be thorough.\n\n508\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.380\nIt needs to be thorough before we ever\nrelease this into the world or whatever.\n\n509\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.640\nSo we're trying to get at something\nthat's your soapbox moment.\n\n510\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.120\nSo go back into your childhood.\n\n511\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.680\nGo backwards, go backwards.\n\n512\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.520\nThink about that for a minute.\n\n513\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.740\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n\n514\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.580\nBecause somethings happened to you when,\ndid you play sports as a kid and\n\n515\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.200\nit was all about the excellence of\nthat sports team and the result.\n\n516\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.320\nIt was that something that was a theme?\n\n517\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.660\nOr was it more about just\nthe camaraderie of the team and\n\n518\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.900\nI really love being with people.\n\n519\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.900\nDo you see what I'm trying to get at?\n\n520\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.320\nIt's a much more emotive,\ncuz we want that to come out.\n\n521\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.550\nI mean, I think it's starting to be\nthere in your mission statement.\n\n522\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.610\nBut you want that to come out, too.\n\n523\n00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.740\nBecause what we want to do is we want\nto attract the people who believe that.\n\n524\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.260\nWe want to repel the people who don't.\n\n525\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.050\nAnd that's a scary thing for us because we\nall want to just sale as much as possible.\n\n526\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.610\nBut we really don't want those customers\nwho don't believe the way they do, right?\n\n527\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.730\nBecause those customers\nare really difficult.\n\n528\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.725\nThey're much more expensive,\nthey're harder to deal with,\n\n529\n00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:01.500\nyou end up spending a lot of\ntime trying to sell them on you.\n\n530\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.495\nYou spend a lot of time trying\nto make them happy with you.\n\n531\n00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.150\nIf they believe what you believe,\nit's just easy,\n\n532\n00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.110\nwe're just a bunch of friends\ndoing business together.\n\n533\n00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.771\nThat's awesome.\n\n534\n00:26:08.771 --> 00:26:14.010\n&gt;&gt; One thing that's working for\nthis company, his grandfather founded\n\n535\n00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:19.173\nthis business in 1965, and\none of his first customers was NASA.\n\n536\n00:26:19.173 --> 00:26:23.793\nThink about the context, in 1965 that was\ntwo years after Kennedy announced that\n\n537\n00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:26.436\nwe were going to put a man\non the moon in ten years.\n\n538\n00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:30.693\nAnd one of his grandpa's\nfirst customers was NASA.\n\n539\n00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:31.754\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that interesting?\n\n540\n00:26:31.754 --> 00:26:33.288\nSo what was your grandpa like?\n\n541\n00:26:33.288 --> 00:26:35.234\nDescribe your grandpa.\n\n542\n00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:36.809\n&gt;&gt; He's was short.\n\n543\n00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:37.537\nThen he died-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:26:37.537 --> 00:26:38.713\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n545\n00:26:38.713 --> 00:26:39.929\nHow does he make you feel?\n\n546\n00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:43.208\n&gt;&gt; But he was a big presence\nwhen he was in the room.\n\n547\n00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n548\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.487\n&gt;&gt; He was the youngest of ten.\n\n549\n00:26:46.487 --> 00:26:48.874\nFather was an alcoholic.\n\n550\n00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:51.712\nHe got to school through the 9th grade,\n\n551\n00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:56.982\nbecause he was the baby of the kids,\nyou get to go longer than anybody else.\n\n552\n00:26:56.982 --> 00:27:02.972\nBut they all worked to support\nthe family with ten kids,\n\n553\n00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:06.672\nand the father not in the picture.\n\n554\n00:27:06.672 --> 00:27:07.605\nHe made things happen.\n\n555\n00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:11.304\nI mean, at one point the IRS has boarded\nup his windows, and he broke through so\n\n556\n00:27:11.304 --> 00:27:14.552\nhe could get in the middle of the night\nand make parts, sell them, and\n\n557\n00:27:14.552 --> 00:27:16.086\nthen start to pay the IRS bills.\n\n558\n00:27:16.086 --> 00:27:20.321\nHe was just one of those that,\nif he wanted to do something,\n\n559\n00:27:20.321 --> 00:27:21.860\nit was gonna happen.\n\n560\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.132\nYou hear stories about how he just\nbuilt a house, who just builds a house?\n\n561\n00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:25.984\nI mean things like that.\n\n562\n00:27:25.984 --> 00:27:26.916\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n563\n00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:29.749\nGot it.\nSo, something about tenacious.\n\n564\n00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:32.817\nSomething about committed, resourceful.\n\n565\n00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.998\nDo you feel like that's\npart of your company today?\n\n566\n00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:41.588\n&gt;&gt; He's nodding his head yes.\n\n567\n00:27:41.588 --> 00:27:42.682\n&gt;&gt; Do you sense that?\n\n568\n00:27:42.682 --> 00:27:46.164\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That we do.\n\n569\n00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.540\nFun, committed, driven.\n\n570\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.156\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] effort.\n\n571\n00:27:50.156 --> 00:27:51.100\n&gt;&gt; Driven, okay, okay.\n\n572\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.960\nSo there may be something there with that,\nthat drive.\n\n573\n00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.290\nSomething with driven.\n\n574\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.460\nWe believe that driving progress forward\nis the way to make a better world.\n\n575\n00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:00.990\nI'm making that up.\n\n576\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.360\nWe all wanna have a better world.\n\n577\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.660\nWe can't all say that in our\nmission statements, okay?\n\n578\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.090\nBut something about driving,\nsomething about the best.\n\n579\n00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.036\nCuz I'm hearing some words of excellence,\nand best, driven, something is there.\n\n580\n00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:14.274\nI wanna use the best quality, blah,\nblah, blah, everybody says that.\n\n581\n00:28:14.274 --> 00:28:18.587\nBut there's something there that I would\nlove for you guys to explore a little bit\n\n582\n00:28:18.587 --> 00:28:21.540\nmore to get that bit of emotion and\nthat bit of belief.\n\n583\n00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.856\nSo if you were to write\na belief statement and\n\n584\n00:28:23.856 --> 00:28:26.303\nthe mission statement\nwas the result of that.\n\n585\n00:28:26.303 --> 00:28:31.764\nWe believe, da, da,\nda is the way to da, da, da.\n\n586\n00:28:31.764 --> 00:28:35.545\nHow we do it is by making a,\nmachining these parts, or whatever.\n\n587\n00:28:35.545 --> 00:28:38.017\nBut how we do it is through\nwhatever innovation,\n\n588\n00:28:38.017 --> 00:28:39.840\nrelentless pursuit of curiosity.\n\n589\n00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.032\nI mean, I'm making this up.\n\n590\n00:28:41.032 --> 00:28:44.633\nWe just happen the machine parts for\nincredible people, whatever.\n\n591\n00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:45.602\nYou see what I'm saying?\n\n592\n00:28:45.602 --> 00:28:48.792\nAnd if we can get that, then we can\nencapsulate that into your messaging where\n\n593\n00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:50.574\npeople can go, I identify with that.\n\n594\n00:28:50.574 --> 00:28:51.482\nSo I think you're there.\n\n595\n00:28:51.482 --> 00:28:55.411\nI think that mission statement's good,\nbut I would love to get that other piece.\n\n596\n00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:56.304\nWho else?\n\n597\n00:28:56.304 --> 00:28:57.197\nYou guys were working.\n\n598\n00:28:57.197 --> 00:28:59.908\nWho else wants to share?\n\n599\n00:28:59.908 --> 00:29:01.726\nCome on you guys were\nworking hard over there.\n\n600\n00:29:04.196 --> 00:29:05.288\n&gt;&gt; Do you wanna know what I wrote?\n\n601\n00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:06.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.\n\n602\n00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:11.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I always wanted to help people\n\n603\n00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:16.422\nprotect what they have, and\nhelp them protect what they do.\n\n604\n00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:19.538\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know if there's a moment\n\n605\n00:29:19.538 --> 00:29:25.060\nin my younger years, but\nthere was a revelation, so to speak.\n\n606\n00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.590\nBut I always seem to get along\nwith lots of different friends.\n\n607\n00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:33.701\nI was always very at ease with people,\n\n608\n00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:40.256\nwhether they were the nerds or\nthe athletes or the whatever.\n\n609\n00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:43.956\nI always could seem to\nrelate to different folks.\n\n610\n00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:46.791\nSo, I don't know if that's\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n611\n00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:48.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n612\n00:29:48.006 --> 00:29:51.677\nSo if I called up your mom and\nsaid what kind of kid was he?\n\n613\n00:29:51.677 --> 00:29:53.384\nHe's the kind of kid that\ngot along with everybody.\n\n614\n00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.558\nEverybody's friend.\n\n615\n00:29:54.558 --> 00:29:56.137\nEverybody liked him.\n\n616\n00:29:56.137 --> 00:29:58.599\nHe seemed to get along with everybody.\n\n617\n00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:00.217\n&gt;&gt; Probably that's what she'd say.\n\n618\n00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:02.366\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\nCool, that's good.\n\n619\n00:30:02.366 --> 00:30:04.429\nAnd so,\nwhere does this protection piece come in?\n\n620\n00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:09.075\nSo did you ever witness\nsomeone who was not protected,\n\n621\n00:30:09.075 --> 00:30:09.966\nor-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so-\n\n622\n00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:11.700\n&gt;&gt; Do those stories, when you heard them,\n\n623\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.590\ndoes the news really\naffect you in some way?\n\n624\n00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.209\n&gt;&gt; Probably the moment that was,\nthat I think back was a big part,\n\n625\n00:30:18.209 --> 00:30:20.920\nwas when I was 17 my dad got cancer.\n\n626\n00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.516\nAnd he went through chemo and\nall this stuff.\n\n627\n00:30:24.516 --> 00:30:29.644\nSo it was a time in my life when\nI was a junior in high school,\n\n628\n00:30:29.644 --> 00:30:32.693\nand then all this drama happened.\n\n629\n00:30:32.693 --> 00:30:33.547\nAll this turmoil.\n\n630\n00:30:33.547 --> 00:30:36.945\nAnd he had to go away and he got sick.\n\n631\n00:30:36.945 --> 00:30:41.884\nSo it was a time in my life at a time\nwhen I probably shouldn't have\n\n632\n00:30:41.884 --> 00:30:43.994\nbeen thinking about that.\n\n633\n00:30:43.994 --> 00:30:45.862\nIt was that.\n\n634\n00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:50.298\nSo that's probably where I think back and\ngo, okay,\n\n635\n00:30:50.298 --> 00:30:54.438\nI want to help people that\ngo through this trauma,\n\n636\n00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:59.881\na very traumatic experience,\nhelp them not, or deal with them.\n\n637\n00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:05.749\nOr, which being in insurance,\nI want to help them if they have a fire or\n\n638\n00:31:05.749 --> 00:31:10.532\nhave a car accident or\na health issue or whatever that is.\n\n639\n00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:15.012\nI think that's probably speaks\nto why I do what I do today.\n\n640\n00:31:15.012 --> 00:31:16.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's some real empathy in there.\n\n641\n00:31:16.881 --> 00:31:20.251\nBecause you can relate to the fact\nthat when your father got sick,\n\n642\n00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:23.260\nthis is this happy-go-lucky\ntime in your life, right?\n\n643\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:23.830\nYou're a teenager.\n\n644\n00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.020\nYou're not supposed to be\nthinking about these things.\n\n645\n00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.510\nThese things don't happen.\n\n646\n00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.140\nAnd it happened to you.\n\n647\n00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.980\nAnd that created anxiety,\nit created stress,\n\n648\n00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.530\nit created a lot of doubt, questions.\n\n649\n00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.990\nAnd all of a sudden,\nthe world became less stable.\n\n650\n00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:40.170\nSo that certainly would make sense that\nnow you are in the insurance industry and\n\n651\n00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:46.000\nyou're helping people who feel like they\nhave more stability by having insurance.\n\n652\n00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.500\nSo there's an extra sense of\nprotection and relief in that.\n\n653\n00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.480\nBut then also when that does happen,\nyou're helping to catch them before they\n\n654\n00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.208\nfall, or at least make that\nfall a little bit softer.\n\n655\n00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:57.075\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n656\n00:31:57.075 --> 00:31:59.880\nOkay, so that's good.\n\n657\n00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.682\nThat's really good.\n\n658\n00:32:00.682 --> 00:32:05.400\nDoes that align with any of your past\nexperiences or what are your insurance?\n\n659\n00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.519\n&gt;&gt; I didn't have the same\nexact experiences.\n\n660\n00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:15.547\nFor me, I think my first job I\nsold shoes in an athletic store.\n\n661\n00:32:15.547 --> 00:32:16.254\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n662\n00:32:16.254 --> 00:32:19.572\n&gt;&gt; Which worked out perfectly cuz in\nhigh school I was a big runner and\n\n663\n00:32:19.572 --> 00:32:21.516\nran every race and did all this stuff.\n\n664\n00:32:21.516 --> 00:32:24.342\nAnd so\nit wasn't about selling shoes necessarily,\n\n665\n00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:26.857\neveryone who came in we\ntalked about running.\n\n666\n00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:28.471\nWhere do you run?\n\n667\n00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:30.456\nTell me about your last 5K.\n\n668\n00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:33.533\nBy the way, here,\nthese are the shoes you need.\n\n669\n00:32:33.533 --> 00:32:38.148\nSo it was pairing the person that you,\nI didn't realize until later that I was\n\n670\n00:32:38.148 --> 00:32:41.280\nalready sort of going,\nwhat kind of runner are you?\n\n671\n00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n672\n00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.164\n&gt;&gt; Where do you run?\n\n673\n00:32:43.164 --> 00:32:45.515\nDon't go here, go here, let's do these.\n\n674\n00:32:45.515 --> 00:32:50.404\nAnd so now it sort of spills over to\nthe insurance of we're educating more.\n\n675\n00:32:50.404 --> 00:32:52.064\nWe had a lot of fun selling shoes.\n\n676\n00:32:52.064 --> 00:32:52.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n677\n00:32:52.981 --> 00:32:54.608\n&gt;&gt; Insurance is not fun.\n\n678\n00:32:54.608 --> 00:32:58.651\nBut if we talk about the new house and\nwhy are you moving to Gainesville?\n\n679\n00:32:58.651 --> 00:32:59.243\nSo you bought a new house.\n\n680\n00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.022\nTell me about all about this stuff.\n\n681\n00:33:00.022 --> 00:33:03.365\nIt makes it a little bit more fun,\nand by the way, we sell insurance.\n\n682\n00:33:03.365 --> 00:33:04.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n683\n00:33:04.305 --> 00:33:09.152\n&gt;&gt; I think we get the sense of\nsatisfaction of doing the right thing when\n\n684\n00:33:09.152 --> 00:33:10.949\nsomething bad happens.\n\n685\n00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:12.209\nWe don't like a bad thing to happen.\n\n686\n00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:17.354\nBut when somebody's house burns to the\nground and we say, yeah, we missed that.\n\n687\n00:33:17.354 --> 00:33:17.995\nYou're not covered.\n\n688\n00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's one of those moments we go,\n\n689\n00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:22.150\nI should do it differently.\n\n690\n00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.090\nOr the reverse happens, hey,\nthat's really horrible, good news.\n\n691\n00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.010\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna get you back on\nyour feet as quickly as possible.\n\n692\n00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.350\n&gt;&gt; We've got you covered on this.\n\n693\n00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.356\nSo I think for us, we get a little bit\nof the, for me anyways, in this backend\n\n694\n00:33:36.356 --> 00:33:41.623\nof when bad things have happened that we\nbeing able to say we did the right thing.\n\n695\n00:33:41.623 --> 00:33:48.822\nAnd so we try to talk a lot to our\nteam about educating customers.\n\n696\n00:33:48.822 --> 00:33:49.805\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n697\n00:33:49.805 --> 00:33:51.923\n&gt;&gt; Not sell them a policy.\n\n698\n00:33:51.923 --> 00:33:55.953\nThere are a lot of agents out there\nthat'll just sell whatever, and\n\n699\n00:33:55.953 --> 00:33:59.004\nget the price down by not\nselling you what you need.\n\n700\n00:33:59.004 --> 00:34:01.477\nWe try not to do that.\n\n701\n00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:04.762\nSo we want customers that\nbelieve in insurance.\n\n702\n00:34:04.762 --> 00:34:10.545\nNot because they're paying us an extra\n50 bucks, but the $50 is what they need.\n\n703\n00:34:10.545 --> 00:34:12.913\nThat's the thing that's\ngonna happen to them.\n\n704\n00:34:12.913 --> 00:34:15.653\nSo we see a lot of it on the back end.\n\n705\n00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:18.407\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n706\n00:34:18.407 --> 00:34:20.088\nOkay, so I get the education piece.\n\n707\n00:34:20.088 --> 00:34:23.067\nAll right, so why is that important to,\n\n708\n00:34:23.067 --> 00:34:27.450\nyou were saying that you wanna\ntake care of these people, so\n\n709\n00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:31.850\nI get the education from your\nexperience at the shoe store.\n\n710\n00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.580\nI think that's a great tie, so\n\n711\n00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:38.030\nthere's gonna be something in the way\nyou are approaching insurance.\n\n712\n00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.341\nAgain, it's more than just a policy.\n\n713\n00:34:39.341 --> 00:34:42.542\nWe're educating you.\n\n714\n00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:45.270\nI'm just trying to think of\nmore of that emotional piece.\n\n715\n00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:49.640\nCuz what do I care about, and why am I\ngonna be wildly excited about referring\n\n716\n00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.580\nyou if I have become your\ninsurance client or customer.\n\n717\n00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.030\nPart of it's going to be\nyour customer experience.\n\n718\n00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.801\nWe'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n719\n00:34:56.801 --> 00:34:58.078\nAnd that's where the education comes in.\n\n720\n00:34:58.078 --> 00:35:00.701\nBut what is it that you believe,\nwhat is it that you believe?\n\n721\n00:35:00.701 --> 00:35:05.482\nI think that you've got the stronger\nemotional, do you see what I'm saying,\n\n722\n00:35:05.482 --> 00:35:10.370\nkind of reason there, and I bet there has\nto be something in there for you, too.\n\n723\n00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.990\nEither you had sort of a,\nwhy did you go into insurance?\n\n724\n00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.586\nWhy do you not own a running shoe store,\na running store?\n\n725\n00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:19.993\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n726\n00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:21.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It just happened.\n\n727\n00:35:21.147 --> 00:35:22.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n728\n00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:24.172\n[LAUGH] just seemed like\na good thing to do or?\n\n729\n00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:27.270\n&gt;&gt; Seemed like a good thing to\ndo at the time, and here we are.\n\n730\n00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I mean,\nsometimes that happens, that's cool.\n\n731\n00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.718\nDid you ever work for\nanother insurance agent, or\n\n732\n00:35:33.718 --> 00:35:34.889\nhave you always been independent?\n\n733\n00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:35.923\n&gt;&gt; I've always been independent.\n\n734\n00:35:35.923 --> 00:35:36.666\n&gt;&gt; You've always been independent.\n\n735\n00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:39.209\nOkay, that's interesting,\nbut why that, I wonder?\n\n736\n00:35:39.209 --> 00:35:43.990\nDid you go straight from working somewhere\nelse to becoming a business owner?\n\n737\n00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.547\nSo how long have you\nbeen a business owner?\n\n738\n00:35:46.547 --> 00:35:47.834\n&gt;&gt; 25 years.\n\n739\n00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:49.508\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so most of your career.\n\n740\n00:35:49.508 --> 00:35:54.301\nAnd who did you work before that or\nwhat did you do before that?\n\n741\n00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:58.907\n&gt;&gt; I worked for the shoe store and\nthen after college I worked for\n\n742\n00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:01.987\na store that owned frozen yogurt shops.\n\n743\n00:36:01.987 --> 00:36:05.401\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so pretty much, you've been\na business owner your whole life.\n\n744\n00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:07.886\nSo there's got to be something there, too.\n\n745\n00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:11.880\nBecause not everyone, I went the corporate\nroute when I graduated college.\n\n746\n00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.641\nI went to work for these big companies or\nadvertising agencies, and\n\n747\n00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.610\nother people will go\nthe business owner route.\n\n748\n00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.790\nI wonder if there's something there\nto the business owner route, too,\n\n749\n00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:25.320\nthat you have more control and ability\nto affect people's lives in that way.\n\n750\n00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.936\nAnd maybe something else to this whole\nidea of how can we help people align with\n\n751\n00:36:30.936 --> 00:36:32.704\nwhat it is you're trying to do?\n\n752\n00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:35.467\nIf I give you more information and\n\n753\n00:36:35.467 --> 00:36:40.501\nI help you understand the experience\nbetter, you can better\n\n754\n00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:46.438\nprotect yourself from the unlikely\nevent that may happen in your life.\n\n755\n00:36:46.438 --> 00:36:47.111\nSomething there,\n\n756\n00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:49.980\ncuz there's gonna be other people who\nreally care about that approach, right?\n\n757\n00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.359\nAnd I'm not trying to push you guys\ninto the educational approach,\n\n758\n00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:53.580\ncuz that may not be it.\n\n759\n00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.800\nIt may be more of a,\nwe've been in your shoes.\n\n760\n00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.457\nWe, in our own lives,\nhave experienced some dramatic things or\n\n761\n00:37:00.457 --> 00:37:03.109\nmaybe not dramatic,\nit's too strong a word.\n\n762\n00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:06.969\nSome difficult, life happens and\nwe wanna make sure that if it\n\n763\n00:37:06.969 --> 00:37:11.664\nhappens to someone else that we're\ngonna mitigate that as best possible.\n\n764\n00:37:11.664 --> 00:37:16.095\nSo there may be something in that because\nwe have to be careful in the insurance cuz\n\n765\n00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:18.740\na lot of insurance companies say that,\nright?\n\n766\n00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.242\nYou're in good hands and\nall that kind of stuff, right?\n\n767\n00:37:20.242 --> 00:37:23.145\nBut I think there's something there.\n\n768\n00:37:23.145 --> 00:37:25.484\nOtherwise you wouldn't\ngravitate to insurance,\n\n769\n00:37:25.484 --> 00:37:27.510\nespecially in the way you deliver it.\n\n770\n00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.651\nSo I want you guys of think a little\nbit more about the way you deliver it,\n\n771\n00:37:31.651 --> 00:37:33.239\nthis educational way, but\n\n772\n00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:37.790\nalso why would I identify with that\nversus someone else in the room.\n\n773\n00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.950\nWhy am I gonna choose\nthis insurance agency?\n\n774\n00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.690\nAnd I know it's hard in your business,\nbecause a lot of times people just get.\n\n775\n00:37:45.222 --> 00:37:47.100\nWe wanna create a strong reason for\n\n776\n00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.220\nus to go here, versus,\nmy neighbor just referred me, right?\n\n777\n00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.310\nBut yet we want your clients to\nbe the person who's referring\n\n778\n00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.710\nyou to the neighbor, right?\n\n779\n00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.980\nBut we want them when they come to your\nwebsite, when they come to your office,\n\n780\n00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.430\nwhen they talk on the phone.\n\n781\n00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.568\nThey're having some sort of experience\nthat's a little like this is different,\n\n782\n00:38:03.568 --> 00:38:05.279\nother than good customer service.\n\n783\n00:38:05.279 --> 00:38:06.498\nDoes that make sense?\n\n784\n00:38:06.498 --> 00:38:10.611\nWe were talking yesterday about\nApopka Bank in the northwest.\n\n785\n00:38:10.611 --> 00:38:11.909\nIt's a bank, right?\n\n786\n00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:16.990\nSo as a bank, everyone who calls that\nbank, do you know what the phone call is?\n\n787\n00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.876\nWorld's greatest bank.\n\n788\n00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:19.350\nThey're like super cheery.\n\n789\n00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.765\nThey're all about customer experience.\n\n790\n00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:25.422\nThey give a lemonade stand\nloans in the community.\n\n791\n00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:28.418\nThey have dog dishes where\nyou can bring your dog in.\n\n792\n00:38:28.418 --> 00:38:32.181\nAnd so they created, and this is a little\nbit more customer experience than why, but\n\n793\n00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:34.100\nthere's a why behind all that.\n\n794\n00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.468\nSo I know if I'm gonna become a customer\nin that bank I'm gonna have a different\n\n795\n00:38:37.468 --> 00:38:38.344\nexperience there.\n\n796\n00:38:38.344 --> 00:38:41.228\nAnd that's what we gonna get to for the\ninsurance company because a lot of times\n\n797\n00:38:41.228 --> 00:38:43.590\nin those industries it's like,\nit's just a bank.\n\n798\n00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.630\nBanks are banks.\n\n799\n00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.280\nA checking account is a checking account.\n\n800\n00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.720\nInsurance policy is an insurance policy.\n\n801\n00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.420\nAnd we wanna get something higher\nthan that that's more motive.\n\n802\n00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.470\nSo that's what we wanna\nkeep thinking about.\n\n803\n00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:54.650\nBut I like where you guys are going.\n\n804\n00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:55.620\nThat's good.\n\n805\n00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.290\nAnyone else before we do Pillar 2?\n\n806\n00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.027\nAnyone else wanna throw\nsomething out here?\n\n807\n00:38:59.027 --> 00:39:01.954\nYes, all right.\n\n808\n00:39:01.954 --> 00:39:03.035\nScorpio.\n\n809\n00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:07.459\n&gt;&gt; She should gave me\nthe break l had [INAUDIBLE].\n\n810\n00:39:07.459 --> 00:39:08.979\n&gt;&gt; I saw that, l saw that.\n\n811\n00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:09.921\nThat's why she's here.\n\n812\n00:39:09.921 --> 00:39:12.911\n&gt;&gt; So we worked pretty hard on this and\nwe think nailed it,\n\n813\n00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:15.457\nwe're talking about our mission statement.\n\n814\n00:39:15.457 --> 00:39:18.778\nBut obviously and\nemotional [INAUDIBLE] to itself.\n\n815\n00:39:18.778 --> 00:39:22.934\nCurrently, it's advancing communities\nthrough superior construction leadership.\n\n816\n00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:24.413\nWe're a construction management company.\n\n817\n00:39:24.413 --> 00:39:27.059\nBut really our mission is\nto advance communities.\n\n818\n00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:30.952\nAnd it's talking about\nconstruction leadership, but\n\n819\n00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:33.446\nreally beyond that for us, right?\n\n820\n00:39:33.446 --> 00:39:38.206\nSo we motivate our team to get out there\nin the community to get involved in a lot\n\n821\n00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:42.466\nof [INAUDIBLE] to become leaders\non different industry initiatives.\n\n822\n00:39:42.466 --> 00:39:44.625\nAnd so we're all over the place.\n\n823\n00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:48.828\nAnd so we're kind of missing\nthe emotional piece of that.\n\n824\n00:39:48.828 --> 00:39:53.018\n&gt;&gt; This is great,\nare you a husband and wife team?\n\n825\n00:39:53.018 --> 00:39:54.640\nSo what's he like?\n\n826\n00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.818\nSo if I say, hey,\nwhat's your husband like?\n\n827\n00:39:55.818 --> 00:40:01.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the editing part,\n\n828\n00:40:01.296 --> 00:40:02.862\nthis is the editing part.\n\n829\n00:40:02.862 --> 00:40:05.161\n&gt;&gt; He is,\n&gt;&gt; Don't look at your sheet,\n\n830\n00:40:05.161 --> 00:40:06.014\njust tell me what he's like.\n\n831\n00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:06.926\nWhat's he like?\n&gt;&gt; He's a leader.\n\n832\n00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:11.180\n&gt;&gt; He's a leader? Okay. &gt;&gt; He definitely\nany situation he comes in he takes over.\n\n833\n00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.835\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And if you can't, I think he can seem,\n\n834\n00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:20.575\nnot awkward, but I think you feel more\ncomfortable in a leadership role.\n\n835\n00:40:20.575 --> 00:40:21.815\nHe inspires people.\n\n836\n00:40:21.815 --> 00:40:24.975\nHe gets people to buy into\nwhatever it is that he's doing.\n\n837\n00:40:24.975 --> 00:40:29.245\nIf it's, go help me set up the boat and\nfill the cooler, they're on it.\n\n838\n00:40:29.245 --> 00:40:32.046\nSo\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n839\n00:40:32.046 --> 00:40:34.239\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen that.\n\n840\n00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:38.274\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we never do.\n\n841\n00:40:38.274 --> 00:40:38.938\nI know.\n\n842\n00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:39.658\nI know.\n\n843\n00:40:39.658 --> 00:40:43.228\n&gt;&gt; And my dad always says,\nhe'll say, D gets shit done.\n\n844\n00:40:43.228 --> 00:40:44.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n\n845\n00:40:44.546 --> 00:40:49.680\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go back to you.\n\n846\n00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.942\nWhat drives you crazy?\n\n847\n00:40:50.942 --> 00:40:53.522\nThe opposite of not getting shit done,\nright?\n\n848\n00:40:53.522 --> 00:40:58.432\nSo someone who's apathetic,\nsomeone's who's apathetic, someone who's-\n\n849\n00:40:58.432 --> 00:40:59.450\n&gt;&gt; What drives me crazy?\n\n850\n00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:02.252\nPeople who do less giving and more taking.\n\n851\n00:41:02.252 --> 00:41:03.562\nThat drives me crazy.\n\n852\n00:41:03.562 --> 00:41:04.652\nTakers drive me crazy.\n\n853\n00:41:04.652 --> 00:41:07.404\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhere does that giving come from?\n\n854\n00:41:07.404 --> 00:41:12.500\n&gt;&gt; Definitely my parents.\n\n855\n00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:18.833\n&gt;&gt; So, I mean, did you grow up in a house\nwhere mom was always taking pies to\n\n856\n00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:21.110\nthe neighbors who needed something or\nwas it more of a.\n\n857\n00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.011\n&gt;&gt; No.\nWe really don't have enough time to get\n\n858\n00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:25.137\ninto all that.\n\n859\n00:41:25.137 --> 00:41:28.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My parents migrated from,\ncame here from Italy.\n\n860\n00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.300\nAnd so they have big family,\n\n861\n00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.713\nwork construction work during the day,\nwork in a bread factory during the night,\n\n862\n00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:38.780\nif this work at the dinner table\nin between, raise seven kids.\n\n863\n00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n864\n00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.672\n&gt;&gt; And at the end of all of that they\nwould enjoy throwing parties and\n\n865\n00:41:43.672 --> 00:41:46.450\nwatching people smile over their food and\nthey are not takers.\n\n866\n00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.100\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; They are givers.\n\n867\n00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.322\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can see that just in\nthat little bit of story you just said,\n\n868\n00:41:52.322 --> 00:41:54.849\nbecause I'm already exhausted\nlistening to that, and\n\n869\n00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:57.560\nI'm not thinking about throwing\na dinner party, really?\n\n870\n00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.884\nSo, see what I'm saying?\n\n871\n00:41:58.884 --> 00:42:01.607\nBut that was the essence of what\nwas important to your parents was,\n\n872\n00:42:01.607 --> 00:42:04.524\neven though we're tired,\neven though we're working all these jobs,\n\n873\n00:42:04.524 --> 00:42:06.980\neven though we have seven children,\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n874\n00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.010\nWe're gonna have this party,\nwe're gonna have this commune.\n\n875\n00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.900\nThis sharing.\n\n876\n00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.370\nSo that's coming out in who\nyou are in as a person.\n\n877\n00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.450\nAnd that's how we approach our business,\nright?\n\n878\n00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.742\nThat's why we sit down with that\npiece of paper like Mary Kay.\n\n879\n00:42:21.742 --> 00:42:25.924\nWe don't say, of course I wanna have\nan amazing construction company but\n\n880\n00:42:25.924 --> 00:42:27.348\nI would do it in this way.\n\n881\n00:42:27.348 --> 00:42:30.562\nSo that might be something\nthat you guys can think about.\n\n882\n00:42:30.562 --> 00:42:33.631\nWe always have to be careful\nwith words like the best.\n\n883\n00:42:33.631 --> 00:42:38.500\nBecause it's about bringing out the best\nin others versus us being the best.\n\n884\n00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.210\nSo there's something\nabout spirit of giving.\n\n885\n00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:47.290\nThere's a construction\ncompany up in the northeast.\n\n886\n00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.739\nTheir emotional piece\nis we build happiness.\n\n887\n00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.220\nAnd if you look at\nthe front of their website,\n\n888\n00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.640\nthe founders are all in,\nI don't know, 1930s golf garb.\n\n889\n00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.500\nThey're always taking their\nemployees out to golf,\n\n890\n00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.500\nthey take their customers out to golf,\nthey do these parties.\n\n891\n00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.370\nIt's all about happiness.\n\n892\n00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.410\nThis is more than just a home,\nit's happiness.\n\n893\n00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.402\nSo it can sound kind of trite\nwhen we just talk about it.\n\n894\n00:43:09.402 --> 00:43:13.236\nBut when you start seeing it and living it\nand experiencing it, just like that bank,\n\n895\n00:43:13.236 --> 00:43:17.170\nworld's greatest bank, you're gonna\nhave this amazing experience with us.\n\n896\n00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:22.209\nThere's something about the giving or\nthat igniting piece that you said\n\n897\n00:43:22.209 --> 00:43:27.917\nwere you get people motivated to move to\nget going, there's energy behind that.\n\n898\n00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:33.340\nAnd there's gonna be other\npeople who identify with that.\n\n899\n00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.150\nWe're going to be like, yeah, it drives\nme crazy, the takers of the world.\n\n900\n00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.869\nOr yeah, it drives me crazy,\nthe people who are apathetic and\n\n901\n00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:41.920\ndon't wanna actually take\nforever to get things done.\n\n902\n00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.400\nLet's just get it done and do it, right?\n\n903\n00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.900\nSo those are two things you guys could\nexplore in that emotional piece as well.\n\n904\n00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.896\nThat's really good.\n\n905\n00:43:48.896 --> 00:43:50.513\nAwesome.\n\n906\n00:43:50.513 --> 00:43:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great job guys!\n\n907\n00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:53.590\nOkay, let's talk about CInderella.\n\n908\n00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.280\nYou guys ready?\n\n909\n00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.520\nAll right, Cinderella.\n\n910\n00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.900\nAny of us who remember reading\nthe story Cinderella, what happened?\n\n911\n00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.139\nCinderella's up in the attic,\nit was the night of the ball,\n\n912\n00:44:04.139 --> 00:44:07.711\nshe's taken her mother's old ball gown,\nand she's fixed it up.\n\n913\n00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.070\nSo she's presentable and\ncan go to the ball.\n\n914\n00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.860\nIt's not super beautiful but it will do.\n\n915\n00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.100\nShe walks downstairs,\n\n916\n00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.010\nher evil stepsister's in a jealous rage,\nrip her dress to shreds.\n\n917\n00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.180\nShe's in tears.\n\n918\n00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.440\nThey go off to the ball cackling and\nshe's left behind.\n\n919\n00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.240\nHow does she feel?\n\n920\n00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.000\nShe feels insignificant.\n\n921\n00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.230\nShe feels like she's not important.\n\n922\n00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.430\nShe feels like she doesn't matter because\nthat's how they make her feel right?\n\n923\n00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.420\nThat's the world she's living in.\n\n924\n00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.030\nFairy godmother comes along, and\nCinderella's like, fairy godmother,\n\n925\n00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.820\nI wanna go to the ball.\n\n926\n00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.100\nAnd Fairy Godmother,\ndoes she just give her a dress?\n\n927\n00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.429\nThat's all she needed right?\n\n928\n00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:47.119\nShe just needs somebody to fix up her\ndress, just mend the dress and I'm gone.\n\n929\n00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.072\nWhat did Fairy Godmother do?\n\n930\n00:44:48.072 --> 00:44:50.595\nNo, she gave her\nan astounding new ball gown,\n\n931\n00:44:50.595 --> 00:44:55.430\nthat was going to be more beautiful\nthat what anyone else at the ball had.\n\n932\n00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.820\nShe turned mice into stallion.\n\n933\n00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.180\nShe turned the pumpkin into a coach.\n\n934\n00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.520\nAnd she gave Cinderella glass slippers.\n\n935\n00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:09.450\nDo you think fairy godmother understood\nwhat Cinderella's true problem was?\n\n936\n00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.768\nHer problem was not that\nshe needed a dress.\n\n937\n00:45:11.768 --> 00:45:14.399\nHer problem was that\nshe felt insignificant.\n\n938\n00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.824\nAnd that she felt like she didn't matter.\n\n939\n00:45:18.824 --> 00:45:21.480\nDo you think fairy godmother made\nhere feel like she mattered?\n\n940\n00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:25.970\nYeah, right?\n\n941\n00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.390\nAnd do you think,\nif there had been Facebook back then,\n\n942\n00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.680\nwhat do you think Cinderella\nwould 've been doing?\n\n943\n00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.890\nSelfie, hello!\n\n944\n00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.470\nShe would have been telling everybody,\n\n945\n00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.529\nyou've gotta get a hold of this\nfairy godmother, she's amazing.\n\n946\n00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.020\nThat's word of mouth worthy.\n\n947\n00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:43.120\nWhy, because she exceeded the pain\npoint that Cinderella had.\n\n948\n00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.320\nIt's not about exceeding expectations.\n\n949\n00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.255\nIt's about really understanding\nthe pain that your customers in,\n\n950\n00:45:50.255 --> 00:45:53.600\nthe problems that they have,\nand solving those problems.\n\n951\n00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.539\nAnd when we do that outside just\nthat product or service transaction.\n\n952\n00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.657\nNow we have become the fairy godmother for\nour clients.\n\n953\n00:46:01.657 --> 00:46:03.540\nAnd now they're gonna\ntell everybody about us.\n\n954\n00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.080\nSo let's take a quick look.\n\n955\n00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.430\nSo what do we have to do, we have to\nfigure out our customers' heaven and hell.\n\n956\n00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:14.600\nThe process of igniting your tribe and\ncreating this foundation,\n\n957\n00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.860\nthat your marketing mix and\n\n958\n00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.260\nyour promotions are gonna sit on top of\nthem, starts with igniting that tribe.\n\n959\n00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:23.490\nAnd that means you have to understand\nall of your customer's challenges and\n\n960\n00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.870\nalleviate that pain for them.\n\n961\n00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.420\nSo you can still make a sale.\n\n962\n00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.380\nWe all buy products and\nservices everyday cuz we just need them.\n\n963\n00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.550\nBut we don't think about it,\nwe don' talk about it later.\n\n964\n00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.920\nWe don't go back to repeatedly\npurchase that stuff.\n\n965\n00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.985\nIt was just a stick of gum.\n\n966\n00:46:37.985 --> 00:46:40.070\nIt was just a tank of gas in my car.\n\n967\n00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.690\nIt was just a tire for my automobile.\n\n968\n00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.980\nSo, you can still make a sale but\nyou won't earn their trust.\n\n969\n00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.840\nAnd what we are talking\nabout is earning trust so\n\n970\n00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.020\nthat we can hold onto that customer.\n\n971\n00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.130\nBecause what is the most expensive\npart of bringing a new customer on?\n\n972\n00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.720\nAcquiring them, right?\n\n973\n00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.370\nWe'd keep them and\nthen they can just refer someone.\n\n974\n00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.170\nBoy, that's really nice for\nmarketing budget, right?\n\n975\n00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.070\nAnd it's really nice for our head too.\n\n976\n00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.550\nIt is stressful to have to constantly\nout there chasing customers.\n\n977\n00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.070\nAll right, so let's take a quick\nexample of what this might look like.\n\n978\n00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.704\nI live in High Springs.\n\n979\n00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:22.310\nI eat pizza 20 miles\naway at Satchel's Pizza.\n\n980\n00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:26.482\nI drive all the way through Gainesville,\npast 6, 8, 10,\n\n981\n00:47:26.482 --> 00:47:29.732\n12 pizzerias to go to\nSatchel's to eat pizza.\n\n982\n00:47:29.732 --> 00:47:33.126\nNow, I don't know about you, but for\nmost of us, pizza is a Friday night.\n\n983\n00:47:33.126 --> 00:47:36.330\nYou call something in on your cellphone,\nthey deliver it to your door.\n\n984\n00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.630\nThank goodness I didn't have to cook,\nit's been a long week.\n\n985\n00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.170\nConvenience food.\n\n986\n00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.120\nNot for our family.\n\n987\n00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.150\nWe drive 20 miles there and 20 miles back.\n\n988\n00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.820\nWhy would I do that?\n\n989\n00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:52.127\nSatchel's solves my hell and\nthey serve my heaven.\n\n990\n00:47:52.127 --> 00:47:55.001\nOkay, so first of all I like their pizza.\n\n991\n00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:57.657\nYou do have to have a product that\nsomeone at least likes, right?\n\n992\n00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:58.773\nIt's fresh and healthy.\n\n993\n00:47:58.773 --> 00:48:01.382\nI do not want salty,\ngreasy pizza at my door.\n\n994\n00:48:01.382 --> 00:48:02.164\nWhy?\n\n995\n00:48:02.164 --> 00:48:03.903\nI'm gonna be up all night drinking water.\n\n996\n00:48:03.903 --> 00:48:07.509\nAnd two, I have little kids and they're\ngonna be up all night drinking water, and\n\n997\n00:48:07.509 --> 00:48:08.932\nsleep is really precious to me.\n\n998\n00:48:08.932 --> 00:48:11.416\nSo it's not gonna help me to\nhave that convenient food for\n\n999\n00:48:11.416 --> 00:48:13.091\nthat moment if I gotta be up all night.\n\n1000\n00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:16.830\nSatchel's is not greasy pizza and they\nalso happen to serve gluten-free pizza,\n\n1001\n00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.850\nwhich yes, we're one of those families,\nwe eat gluten-free.\n\n1002\n00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:23.907\nAnd instead of giving me a little bitty\n6-inch gluten-free pizza for $14,\n\n1003\n00:48:23.907 --> 00:48:28.279\nhe gives me a 12-inch gluten-free pizza\nfor $14 that I can feed my whole family.\n\n1004\n00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:32.503\nNow there's other places in town that\nhave really good pizza that's fresh but\n\n1005\n00:48:32.503 --> 00:48:33.980\nI don't stop there to eat.\n\n1006\n00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.500\nWhy?\n\n1007\n00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.730\nOkay, I just told you, I have little kids.\n\n1008\n00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.880\nBut what happens if you\nstop at a pizza place and\n\n1009\n00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.780\nyou guys sit in a booth\nwith your little kids.\n\n1010\n00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:45.172\nOkay, okay, hold on a second.\n\n1011\n00:48:45.172 --> 00:48:46.760\nYeah, the pizza will be\nhere in five minutes.\n\n1012\n00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.092\nWaitress, where's the pizza?\n\n1013\n00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:49.620\nHurry up.\nOkay, do you want mommy's iPad?\n\n1014\n00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.650\nDo you wanna color?\n\n1015\n00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.090\nHey, let's do the let's all sing a song.\n\n1016\n00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.230\nThat's what I'm doing in the booth.\n\n1017\n00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.670\nI don't wanna do that on a Friday night,\nthat's exhausting.\n\n1018\n00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:00.140\nIt'd be cheaper for me and easier for\nme just to go buy a pizza at the store and\n\n1019\n00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.400\nstick it in the oven, right?\n\n1020\n00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.480\nSatchel's has playgrounds.\n\n1021\n00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.330\nThey have sandboxes.\n\n1022\n00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:04.940\nThey have trucks.\n\n1023\n00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:05.700\nThey have jungle gyms.\n\n1024\n00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.530\nThey have treehouses.\n\n1025\n00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.830\nThey have hammocks.\n\n1026\n00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.090\nMy kids run all over that place and\nguess what I do?\n\n1027\n00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.050\nI don't, I sit, and I eat pizza.\n\n1028\n00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.730\nAnd have a glass of wine with my husband.\n\n1029\n00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:15.860\nIt's like a date.\n\n1030\n00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.360\nIt's really,\n\n1031\n00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:22.770\nreally great because that's my pain\nassociated with going out to eat, right?\n\n1032\n00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.190\nSatchel's are solving that pain for me.\n\n1033\n00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.730\nI get to eat the the product I want,\nthe pizza, but it's also solving our pain.\n\n1034\n00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.050\nOkay, so not only are they\nfamily-friendly, but guess what?\n\n1035\n00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:34.150\nThey have entertainment.\n\n1036\n00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.990\nThere's always a band\nplaying at Satchel's.\n\n1037\n00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.190\nThat is so awesome.\n\n1038\n00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.440\nI'm a parent, I have young kids.\n\n1039\n00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.190\nIf I want entertainment, I either have\nto tell my kids, hurry up, hurry up,\n\n1040\n00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.790\nhurry up and eat.\n\n1041\n00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.420\nCuz we're running late to the concert.\n\n1042\n00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.440\nWe're running late to the late movie.\n\n1043\n00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.620\nWe're running late to the blah,\nblah, blah event.\n\n1044\n00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.840\nAgain, the rest of our life is\nalready time strained enough.\n\n1045\n00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.220\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n1046\n00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.460\nOr I just totally miss out on\nhaving entertainment, right?\n\n1047\n00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.140\nAnd I'm watching Disney Channel\nwith my kids all the time.\n\n1048\n00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.990\nHere I get to go listen\nto some cool bands.\n\n1049\n00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.480\nI get to tell all my friends,\nI heard a band last week, ha ha.\n\n1050\n00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.660\nAnd I'm having an adult beverage, my\nchildren are running around, I'm eating.\n\n1051\n00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.360\nThis is like, wow, I feel like I'm in\ncollege again, this is pretty cool.\n\n1052\n00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.310\nAnd what happens when I'm sitting\nthere listening to a band?\n\n1053\n00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:18.693\nI eat a second pizza.\n\n1054\n00:50:18.693 --> 00:50:19.681\nI have dessert.\n\n1055\n00:50:19.681 --> 00:50:21.212\nI have another glass of wine.\n\n1056\n00:50:21.212 --> 00:50:24.810\nI have a salad.\nI'm spending more money.\n\n1057\n00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.465\nFinally Satchel's says something that's\nreally rare in this day and age.\n\n1058\n00:50:28.465 --> 00:50:30.531\nIt's a cash only business.\n\n1059\n00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:33.906\nHow many people have cash\nin their pocket right now?\n\n1060\n00:50:33.906 --> 00:50:35.318\nA couple, okay.\n\n1061\n00:50:35.318 --> 00:50:35.888\nNot that many.\n\n1062\n00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:36.758\nI never have cash.\n\n1063\n00:50:36.758 --> 00:50:38.470\nI never carry cash.\n\n1064\n00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.790\nSo when you go there, you have to\nget money out of an ATM machine.\n\n1065\n00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:43.423\nAnd I never do that.\n\n1066\n00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:46.110\nWhy, because at Satchel's,\nhe's got two ATM machines.\n\n1067\n00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.550\nI stick my card in.\n\n1068\n00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:48.916\nI have to pay $1.50 service fee.\n\n1069\n00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:51.020\nAnd guess where that $1.50 goes?\n\n1070\n00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.575\nTo the local community, and\nI get to be a part of that.\n\n1071\n00:50:54.575 --> 00:50:58.311\nSo, I got to go out to eat and\neat something I love.\n\n1072\n00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.621\nI got to have a break from my kids and\n\n1073\n00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:03.743\nknow that they're still\nhaving a great time.\n\n1074\n00:51:03.743 --> 00:51:05.403\nI didn't have to hire a babysitter.\n\n1075\n00:51:05.403 --> 00:51:07.337\nI got to listen to great music, and\n\n1076\n00:51:07.337 --> 00:51:10.021\nI contributed to my\ncommunity all in one night.\n\n1077\n00:51:10.021 --> 00:51:11.840\nI'm doing pretty good for\na Friday night, right?\n\n1078\n00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.640\nThat's amazing.\n\n1079\n00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.870\nAnd there's other pizzerias in town that\nI've been to and they will have a plaque\n\n1080\n00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.655\non the wall that says, hey,\nwe donated money to a local sports team.\n\n1081\n00:51:21.655 --> 00:51:23.380\nI think that's great.\n\n1082\n00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.713\nI'm not a part of that.\n\n1083\n00:51:25.713 --> 00:51:27.710\nI'm glad that you're donating\nto a local sports team.\n\n1084\n00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.808\nMy company donates things, too.\n\n1085\n00:51:29.808 --> 00:51:34.210\nBut I wanna be involved in that and\nparticipating in it.\n\n1086\n00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.905\nNow I am part of your brand.\n\n1087\n00:51:35.905 --> 00:51:37.102\nDo you see that?\n\n1088\n00:51:37.102 --> 00:51:39.040\nSo what happens?\n\n1089\n00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.940\nNot only does Satchel's\nhave a loyal customer.\n\n1090\n00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.159\nI've even been to Satchel's when\nthey didn't have gluten-free pizza.\n\n1091\n00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:45.874\nAnd I'm cool with that,\nI just had a salad.\n\n1092\n00:51:45.874 --> 00:51:47.325\nYeah, I was disappointed.\n\n1093\n00:51:47.325 --> 00:51:49.151\nHe's got a customer for life.\n\n1094\n00:51:49.151 --> 00:51:50.723\nGuess what happens when\nmy family comes in town.\n\n1095\n00:51:50.723 --> 00:51:52.044\nWhere do we go?\n\n1096\n00:51:52.044 --> 00:51:53.200\nSatchel's Pizza.\n\n1097\n00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.200\nGuess what happens when someone\nmoves to town and they say, Kate,\n\n1098\n00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.780\nwhere's a cool place to eat?\n\n1099\n00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.020\nSatchel's Pizza.\n\n1100\n00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.420\nGuess what I tell all my mommy\nfriends at the playground?\n\n1101\n00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.250\nYou gotta go to Satchel's Pizza.\n\n1102\n00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.380\nDo we all want that for our business?\n\n1103\n00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:04.880\nHello?\n\n1104\n00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:11.020\nSo Satchel's is serving me heaven and\nsolving my health.\n\n1105\n00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:17.054\nHe makes it so effortless for me to\ndrive 40 miles round-trip and pay cash.\n\n1106\n00:52:17.054 --> 00:52:18.410\nDo you see that?\n\n1107\n00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:20.720\nSo there's still some little things\nthere that you're like, wow, really,\n\n1108\n00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.252\nyou'll do that?\n\n1109\n00:52:21.252 --> 00:52:24.843\nAbsolutely, cuz if you're gonna\ngive me this I will walk the moon.\n\n1110\n00:52:24.843 --> 00:52:27.543\nThat's amazing.\n\n1111\n00:52:27.543 --> 00:52:30.680\nOkay, so when you act like your\ncustomer's fairy godmother,\n\n1112\n00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.830\nyou create that customer for\nlife, very high retention rate.\n\n1113\n00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.390\nStarbucks has a 75% retention rate for\ntheir customers.\n\n1114\n00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.108\nThat is ridiculous in that industry.\n\n1115\n00:52:40.108 --> 00:52:42.089\n75%, that's crazy.\n\n1116\n00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.240\nYou cannot do this,\nyou do not have to do this.\n\n1117\n00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.030\nBut what happens?\n\n1118\n00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.420\nAnd we talked about that a little\nbit earlier, is in your funnel\n\n1119\n00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.100\neveryone's gonna hit that orange\nbar first that says consideration.\n\n1120\n00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.490\nSo you can say,\nwe have pizza 5.99 with a Diet Coke.\n\n1121\n00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.290\nPizza two for one,\nextra large, cheese, toppings.\n\n1122\n00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:02.770\nDo you see what happens?\n\n1123\n00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.340\nSo now what I'm doing is looking at all\nthe flyers that were left in my mailbox\n\n1124\n00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.750\nand I'm just comparing which one's\ncheaper, or which one has more cheese,\n\n1125\n00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.370\nor which one's bigger or\nwhich one will be delivered faster.\n\n1126\n00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:15.470\nYou automatically have\ntaken me from here to here.\n\n1127\n00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.755\nAnd so now my brain is evaluating, and\nyou're automatically being compared\n\n1128\n00:53:18.755 --> 00:53:23.480\nagainst your competition versus, no, no,\nno, I wanna see what you have first.\n\n1129\n00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.460\nI have done it.\n\n1130\n00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.160\nLet me see what you have first.\n\n1131\n00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.140\nAnd isn't that what we want?\n\n1132\n00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:31.100\nAnd I just want someone to walk through\nmy door first, just choose me first and\n\n1133\n00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.940\ngive me that opportunity.\n\n1134\n00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.510\nIf I don't have what you need,\nthat's cool.\n\n1135\n00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.400\nAnd when we do this, when we take this\napproach where people can see, you get me.\n\n1136\n00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.630\nNot only do I identify with\nyou on an emotional level, but\n\n1137\n00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:42.750\nyou understand my pain.\n\n1138\n00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.783\nNow I'm ready to go\nthrough your whole funnel.\n\n1139\n00:53:45.783 --> 00:53:49.131\nAnd I still get to\nthe consideration piece, and\n\n1140\n00:53:49.131 --> 00:53:51.734\nyou may not exactly have what I want.\n\n1141\n00:53:51.734 --> 00:53:53.991\nTypically, it's a much easier sale.\n\n1142\n00:53:53.991 --> 00:53:58.479\nAnd at that point, you, your salesforce,\nwhoever is doing the selling for you,\n\n1143\n00:53:58.479 --> 00:54:01.682\nthis is easy, this is fun,\nand it's really profitable.\n\n1144\n00:54:01.682 --> 00:54:05.041\nOkay, so much more difficult,\nyou still can make a sale.\n\n1145\n00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.990\nBut again, and then the other piece\nthat you miss out on is word of mouth.\n\n1146\n00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:09.640\nNobody is gonna recommend\nyou at this point.\n\n1147\n00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.558\nOkay, we have gone through Pillar 2 and\nwe're gonna take another short break and\n\n1148\n00:54:15.558 --> 00:54:19.081\nthen Pillars 3 and 4 are longer cuz I've\ngot some really cool case studies that\n\n1149\n00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:20.415\nI'm gonna bring all this in.\n\n1150\n00:54:20.415 --> 00:54:23.910\nSo you can see how other companies\nhave started to bring this to life.\n\n1151\n00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:29.263\nAll right, guys, so\nwe just finished [SOUND] Pillar 2.\n\n1152\n00:54:29.263 --> 00:54:31.801\nSo you guys have, again, in your handout.\n\n1153\n00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.571\nLet's talk a little bit about\nbeing a fairy godmother.\n\n1154\n00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:38.060\nSo this piece, hopefully,\nwill be a little bit easier.\n\n1155\n00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.150\nBut who's your customer and\nwhat's their heaven and hell?\n\n1156\n00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.760\nSo I want you to think about,\nyou have this customer transaction.\n\n1157\n00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.373\nBut what are some of the things outside\nthe customer transaction that are still\n\n1158\n00:54:47.373 --> 00:54:48.861\nchallenges for your customer?\n\n1159\n00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:52.083\nSo let's just take a second,\nand we can do it as a group.\n\n1160\n00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:54.713\nIf you guys wanna volunteer or\ntake a minute and do it on your paper and\n\n1161\n00:54:54.713 --> 00:54:55.461\nthen we'll talk.\n\n1162\n00:54:55.461 --> 00:54:56.970\nWho is your customer?\n\n1163\n00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:59.462\nWhat's their heaven and hell?\n\n1164\n00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:04.300\nAnd how are you serving heaven and\nsolving hell for them?\n\n1165\n00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:09.107\n&gt;&gt; My personal clients getting consulting\n\n1166\n00:55:09.107 --> 00:55:13.770\nis that they're all business owners,\n\n1167\n00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.716\nand so I'm dealing directly with them and\n\n1168\n00:55:18.716 --> 00:55:22.834\nsometimes their office manager.\n\n1169\n00:55:22.834 --> 00:55:23.558\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n1170\n00:55:23.558 --> 00:55:27.514\nI see them building their businesses\nthrough marketing, internal and external.\n\n1171\n00:55:27.514 --> 00:55:31.156\nAnd so their head, of course,\nis lots of clients,\n\n1172\n00:55:31.156 --> 00:55:34.139\nlots of compliments on their marketing.\n\n1173\n00:55:34.139 --> 00:55:35.200\nI hear that.\n\n1174\n00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:41.205\nAnd then, happy employees and family,\nmore dollars coming in than going out.\n\n1175\n00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:42.828\nThat's the biggie.\n\n1176\n00:55:42.828 --> 00:55:44.409\nAnd of course,they have the opposite.\n\n1177\n00:55:44.409 --> 00:55:49.302\nNot enough investment,\nemployee issues, personal issues,\n\n1178\n00:55:49.302 --> 00:55:53.005\nand businesships that\nthey're not ready for.\n\n1179\n00:55:53.005 --> 00:55:55.559\nIt's kind of a wake up call.\n\n1180\n00:55:55.559 --> 00:56:00.136\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so how are you helping them\nsolve those various pain points?\n\n1181\n00:56:00.136 --> 00:56:04.920\n&gt;&gt; And in giving them that\nCinderella's glass slipper moment.\n\n1182\n00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.770\n&gt;&gt; A lot of time they use publicity.\n\n1183\n00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:11.690\nYou know I listen to what those\nproblems are if there's a problem and\n\n1184\n00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.480\nthen help you then work through\nsolving those problems.\n\n1185\n00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.758\nWhether they're really business or\npersonal.\n\n1186\n00:56:16.758 --> 00:56:17.738\nIn our ways, but\n\n1187\n00:56:17.738 --> 00:56:22.369\nI'm sure you're very focused on\nthe business part while you're marketing.\n\n1188\n00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:27.404\nI find you get that I'm not the solution\nas a consultant, let me go back to when\n\n1189\n00:56:27.404 --> 00:56:32.362\nI was an employee and we had consultants\ncome in I always found when I went in,\n\n1190\n00:56:32.362 --> 00:56:38.210\nwhen I left they didn't really do anything\nexcept, pull the answers out of us.\n\n1191\n00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n1192\n00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.060\nI feel like that's kind of what I do.\n\n1193\n00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:44.580\nI'm there to listen, and then help them\nwork through the issues that they have,\n\n1194\n00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.690\nand they usually\nare the problem-solver more than I am.\n\n1195\n00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:49.250\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n1196\n00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:51.905\n&gt;&gt; They know the answer, they just don't\nknow how to articulate it sometimes.\n\n1197\n00:56:51.905 --> 00:56:53.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n1198\n00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:58.590\n&gt;&gt; And I listen closely, and then I'm\nhearing the answer to the problems.\n\n1199\n00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.050\nKind of regurgitate that, and\nthen we both figure it out.\n\n1200\n00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:03.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n1201\n00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.620\nSo what gives them that\nglass slipper moment?\n\n1202\n00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.260\nIs it that, wow, this was right\nunder our nose the whole time and\n\n1203\n00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:10.500\nyou helped us to see it?\n\n1204\n00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.170\nDo they see your role in that?\n\n1205\n00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:17.403\nIs it wow you help us see something\nthat we needed to do that now we've\n\n1206\n00:57:17.403 --> 00:57:21.587\nimplemented it our business has\ngrown as a quantitative results.\n\n1207\n00:57:21.587 --> 00:57:26.110\nIs it everybody else ever come in to\nconsult with us to never do anything?\n\n1208\n00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:29.890\nYou actually do something like what's\ntheir aha moment that makes them go.\n\n1209\n00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.931\nWe need to recommend this guide up\nall to the business owners in town.\n\n1210\n00:57:36.948 --> 00:57:41.892\n&gt;&gt; It's just that when we finally\nget to that solution, and\n\n1211\n00:57:41.892 --> 00:57:45.618\nthen, how am I going\nto help them solve it.\n\n1212\n00:57:45.618 --> 00:57:49.125\nUsually, it's Nick, do this, this,\nand this, you're gonna do that, right?\n\n1213\n00:57:49.125 --> 00:57:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; I'm more like a personal assistant,\n\n1214\n00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:53.059\nI feel like I'm kinda like that.\n\n1215\n00:57:54.603 --> 00:57:55.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1216\n00:57:55.166 --> 00:57:58.412\n&gt;&gt; I'd rather,\nI feel like I'm better at and\n\n1217\n00:57:58.412 --> 00:58:03.472\nI like helping other people grow\ntheir business than doing my own.\n\n1218\n00:58:03.472 --> 00:58:05.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n1219\n00:58:05.105 --> 00:58:09.024\nOkay.\nFair enough.\n\n1220\n00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:10.590\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n1221\n00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:11.610\nOkay so one\n\n1222\n00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:15.290\nof your clients happens to be that\nyou really focused on them, right?\n\n1223\n00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:16.700\nBecause you handle a lot\nof different businesses and\n\n1224\n00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.890\nthey don't want to hear about everybody\nelses business they want to make sure that\n\n1225\n00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:21.590\nwhen your in their door\nyour in their door.\n\n1226\n00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:23.140\nDo you actually,\nare you on site with them?\n\n1227\n00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.943\n&gt;&gt; Very rarely.\n\n1228\n00:58:24.943 --> 00:58:27.080\n&gt;&gt; Very rarely okay so\nthis is all virtual?\n\n1229\n00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Most of it yes [INAUDIBLE]\nmostly it's phone.\n\n1230\n00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.980\nI have a few clients in town but\nI have about half hour out of town.\n\n1231\n00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Out of town, okay.\n\n1232\n00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:41.790\nSo would another piece of hell be\nthat I can't get a hold of you?\n\n1233\n00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:42.870\nNo, I'm just saying could it be?\n\n1234\n00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.630\nLike it's difficult for me to schedule\ntime because you're so busy, and you have\n\n1235\n00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.580\nall these clients, and it's really\nhard for me to get on your schedule.\n\n1236\n00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.840\nOr is it that you give them a consistent\nschedule every week or every month?\n\n1237\n00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.110\nI don't know how you work.\n\n1238\n00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.460\n&gt;&gt; You know, it\n&gt;&gt; I guess that's what I might be good at,\n\n1239\n00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.230\nis I think they get the impression\nI'm always sitting and\n\n1240\n00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.840\nwaiting for them to call.\n\n1241\n00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.710\n&gt;&gt; You're always available,\nokay, so see what I'm saying?\n\n1242\n00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:05.800\nSo that's a slice of heaven, potentially.\n\n1243\n00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.750\nCuz I know if a client or a customer has\nan issue, they don't want to wait for\n\n1244\n00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:13.750\nyou to come to them eight hours\nlater after the house burned down,\n\n1245\n00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.660\nthey'll come like we'll be there now,\nright?\n\n1246\n00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.840\nSo that's, see what I'm saying, I'm trying\nto draw that out to make it be more\n\n1247\n00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:22.980\nof a like this is what you really doing,\nyou're always available, right?\n\n1248\n00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:27.300\nAnd so that can even come into, again, you\nprobably have a really nice network and\n\n1249\n00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.310\nthere's a lot of word of mouth but\n\n1250\n00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.320\nif you are doing some\nmarketing that can come into.\n\n1251\n00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:32.630\nI'm here for you twenty four seven.\n\n1252\n00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:34.270\nYou're not really there\ntwenty four seven and\n\n1253\n00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:37.710\nthey're not gonna call you twenty four\nseven, but they feel like you are and\n\n1254\n00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.300\nthat's that service\nattitude that you have.\n\n1255\n00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.380\nWhich is, I'm not gonna say\nyou're Thursday, you're Friday.\n\n1256\n00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:48.710\n&gt;&gt; I hate to have to not be\navailable when they need me.\n\n1257\n00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n1258\n00:59:49.227 --> 00:59:52.711\nDo they have really clear expectations\nof how long that phone call can be and\n\n1259\n00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:54.110\nhow long they can talk to you?\n\n1260\n00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.085\nIt's just as much as they need?\n\n1261\n00:59:55.085 --> 00:59:57.203\n&gt;&gt; It's as much as they need.\n\n1262\n00:59:57.203 --> 01:00:01.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool,\nwhat's gonna make them refer you?\n\n1263\n01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:07.690\nWhat's gonna make them go, you've\ngotta be doing business with this guy?\n\n1264\n01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:13.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess it's just that what\nthey like is that personalized service.\n\n1265\n01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's kinda really\n\n1266\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.400\nwhy they refer me.\n\n1267\n01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nIt's like, we want somebody gonna\n\n1268\n01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.830\nbe right there for you,\nand take care of things.\n\n1269\n01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.005\nHere's your guy.\n\n1270\n01:00:23.005 --> 01:00:23.545\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n1271\n01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:25.035\nOkay.\nSo it's immediate response.\n\n1272\n01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:27.695\nCuz I'm trying to narrow it down and\nyou're a marketer, you know.\n\n1273\n01:00:27.695 --> 01:00:30.395\nI'm trying to narrow it down from\npersonalized service cuz I'd say\n\n1274\n01:00:30.395 --> 01:00:31.395\nthe same thing about my clients.\n\n1275\n01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:32.545\nYou'd say the same thing\nabout your clients.\n\n1276\n01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:33.705\nWe all do personalized service.\n\n1277\n01:00:33.705 --> 01:00:36.530\nNobody's gonna say I give\nyou impersonal service.\n\n1278\n01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n1279\n01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.730\nSo, we all do personalized service and\nwe all want to save the world, and\n\n1280\n01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.430\nwe're all the best, and\nwe are high quality.\n\n1281\n01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:46.450\nSo, what we really had to do is get that\ndown to language that I can identify with,\n\n1282\n01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:48.670\nthat I'm looking for, right?\n\n1283\n01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.720\nSo, if I want to talk\nabout Satchel's Pizza,\n\n1284\n01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.279\nwhen I tell my girlfriends I'm not\njust like, man they're so amazing.\n\n1285\n01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:57.650\nYou know, I'm like my gosh,\nI get this really fresh pizza and\n\n1286\n01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:58.880\nmy kids get to do this.\n\n1287\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.690\nWe want to give people something to\ntalk about and sometimes you have\n\n1288\n01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.490\nto give them something to talk about,\nyou have to tell them what that is.\n\n1289\n01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:07.220\nSo, again I don't want to put\ntwenty four seven on your\n\n1290\n01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.115\nbusiness card because that's.\n\n1291\n01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:11.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But you know whatever it is the service\n\n1292\n01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700\nattitude, this twenty four seven it's\nmore than personalized service it's,\n\n1293\n01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.260\nyou will feel like you're the only person\nin the room when you're working with me.\n\n1294\n01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.360\nYou will know that I am\ncompletely 100% focused on you,\n\n1295\n01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.820\nsomething to that piece is how we would\ncreate some momentum around that,\n\n1296\n01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:35.560\nso when they do call someone else,\nthey're able to put words to it.\n\n1297\n01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.970\n&gt;&gt; Like I have this great\nstory about a plumber.\n\n1298\n01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:39.750\nMy husband and\nI have some investment properties, and\n\n1299\n01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.190\nwe each have a different\nplumber we'll call.\n\n1300\n01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.940\nSo if we get the call from one of our\ntenants about plumbing, he calls this guy,\n\n1301\n01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.620\nand I call that guy.\n\n1302\n01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.680\nSo if any of you walked up and you said,\nKate, do you have a good plumber?\n\n1303\n01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.000\nI'd say, yeah, and I'd give you his name.\n\n1304\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.900\nAnd that's how that transaction\nwould happen, right?\n\n1305\n01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.660\nBut if you call my husband, and you said,\nhey, do you have a good plumber, Scott?\n\n1306\n01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.520\nHe would give you a different name.\n\n1307\n01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.450\nBut that's weird, why?\n\n1308\n01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.030\nAnd I'm like, do not call that plumber.\n\n1309\n01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:04.800\nAnd he would be like,\ndo not call her plumber.\n\n1310\n01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.010\nWe're not telling you enough information\nand you're not asking enough information.\n\n1311\n01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:11.460\nThe reason I love the plumber I call\nis because I know I'm gonna call them.\n\n1312\n01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.850\nI'm gonna pay them whatever they charge.\n\n1313\n01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.690\nIt's gonna be done and\nI don't have to hear about it ever again.\n\n1314\n01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.700\nThe reason he likes his plumbers, the\nguy's like dude there's this pipe and this\n\n1315\n01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.000\nand if you just get it with a vacuum and\nthe copper one and I'm like, no, no, no.\n\n1316\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.310\nThe first time I took\na call from that guy and\n\n1317\n01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.710\nhe told me I had to go wet vac something,\nI was like no no,\n\n1318\n01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:32.330\nI'm not wet vac-ing anything,\nI'm calling to wet vac whatever burst.\n\n1319\n01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.720\nBut my husband loves it,\ncuz he wants to get under the cabinet and\n\n1320\n01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.700\ndo all that stuff with him,\nand they do it together and\n\n1321\n01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.660\nmy husband gets to learn stuff, you see\nwhat a different recommendation that is?\n\n1322\n01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.540\nSo sometimes we have to give our customers\nthe words if we're in an industry\n\n1323\n01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.490\nlike a consulting industry or the plumbing\nindustry, or like the electrical industry.\n\n1324\n01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:52.160\nBecause it just can't be like call Joe,\nhe's a good dude, right?\n\n1325\n01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.670\nThat's just not enough.\n\n1326\n01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.070\nSo what is it that you do that's good?\n\n1327\n01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.060\nBecause you may not like my plumber.\n\n1328\n01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.910\nYou may want Scott's plumber or\nvice versa.\n\n1329\n01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:00.990\nSo that's what I'm trying to get to.\n\n1330\n01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.790\nDoes that make sense?\n\n1331\n01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:04.010\nOkay, awesome.\n\n1332\n01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:05.360\nAnyone else?\n\n1333\n01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.530\nCustomer heaven, hell?\n\n1334\n01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:07.910\nCustomer heaven, hell?\n\n1335\n01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:08.518\nYou guys, okay.\n\n1336\n01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.108\nArt?\n\n1337\n01:03:10.108 --> 01:03:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\nwe provide dental services.\n\n1338\n01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:22.589\nSo our clients, our patients\nwould be pain free, comfortable.\n\n1339\n01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:27.742\nIt's affordable, beautiful work, natural,\n\n1340\n01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:31.780\ncaring, and compassionate people.\n\n1341\n01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.566\nAs far as in the services we provide,\n\n1342\n01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:39.721\nhell's just thait would be anything for\n\n1343\n01:03:39.721 --> 01:03:44.730\nany demo patient, and\nthat would be be painful,\n\n1344\n01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:48.411\nexpensive, uncaring providers.\n\n1345\n01:03:48.411 --> 01:03:54.275\nAnd maybe one of the other things is that\nwe're known for doing things relatively,\n\n1346\n01:03:54.275 --> 01:03:59.906\nin shorter periods of time than what could\nnormally be done, so long Drawn out.\n\n1347\n01:03:59.906 --> 01:04:04.460\n&gt;&gt; Long, drawn out things can be really\nfrustrating, especially for busy people.\n\n1348\n01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n1349\n01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.640\nSo that,\nI like that last one you said the best.\n\n1350\n01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.200\nCuz I'm imagining if I'm a dentist.\n\n1351\n01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.460\nI'm not gonna say to someone,\nyou know what, this is gonna be the most\n\n1352\n01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.850\npainful experience of your life,\nbut I'm gonna get you through it.\n\n1353\n01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.700\nThere's no dentist who wants to say that,\nright?\n\n1354\n01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.120\nSo you're gonna say, I'm gonna\nmake it as pain free as possible.\n\n1355\n01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.430\nSo pain free, that's a huge fear most\nof us have when going to the dentist.\n\n1356\n01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:28.120\nThat last piece though, that was something\nthat I think is a little bit different.\n\n1357\n01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.020\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n\n1358\n01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.010\nWhich is like, if I have to have\ncosmetic dentistry, my gosh,\n\n1359\n01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.970\nam I gonna be walking around looking\nlike Jekyll and Hyde for six months?\n\n1360\n01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.520\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n1361\n01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.545\nWill I be able to talk?\n\n1362\n01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:41.374\nIs my, all these different, I'm\nimagining I'm having a lot of questions.\n\n1363\n01:04:41.374 --> 01:04:44.140\nYou're like you're gonna get done\ninstead of six months and four months.\n\n1364\n01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.450\nOr instead of six days and\nfour days or whatever it is, right?\n\n1365\n01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.830\nSo that's something that you can\nreally market that's different.\n\n1366\n01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.710\nPotentially, the way\nyou make it pain free.\n\n1367\n01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.110\nCuz there's a lot of different ways.\n\n1368\n01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:56.142\nAre you scared of needles?\n\n1369\n01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.270\nOr are you gonna have gas?\n\n1370\n01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.205\nAnd I don't know what all these\n\n1371\n01:04:58.205 --> 01:04:59.420\n[INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; We knock them out.\n\n1372\n01:04:59.420 --> 01:04:59.960\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n1373\n01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.780\nSee, I like that.\n\n1374\n01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.170\nI like that.\n\n1375\n01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.004\nYou add a glass of wine to that and\nit's even better.\n\n1376\n01:05:05.004 --> 01:05:07.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was a big trend\n\n1377\n01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.590\nin the industry for a while.\n\n1378\n01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.400\nNot so much anymore.\n\n1379\n01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.560\nOkay, what else?\n\n1380\n01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.390\nWhat else would be a hell?\n\n1381\n01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:15.350\nScheduling can be a hell for me.\n\n1382\n01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.090\nI'm a busy person.\n\n1383\n01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:20.100\nWould I have to call your,\nI don't wanna call your office.\n\n1384\n01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.790\nI wanna just go to a scheduler,\nor I just wanna text.\n\n1385\n01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:27.490\nSo maybe giving people different ways to\nschedule could be a related thing to that.\n\n1386\n01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.860\nI know one time I had\na dermatology appointment and\n\n1387\n01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.670\nit was the first time I'd\never been to this place.\n\n1388\n01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:33.970\nAnd they sent a text.\n\n1389\n01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.690\nAnd it's probably for them so\nno one misses the appointment, right?\n\n1390\n01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:39.250\nBut they sent me a text and\nit said Kate, time to start driving.\n\n1391\n01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.330\nIt'll take you however many minutes.\n\n1392\n01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:42.585\nAnd I was like my god, that's so nice.\n\n1393\n01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:43.515\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n\n1394\n01:05:43.515 --> 01:05:44.980\nIt's like this emotional reaction.\n\n1395\n01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.585\nAnd what they're saying is\nwe don't want a no show.\n\n1396\n01:05:46.585 --> 01:05:47.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1397\n01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.280\n&gt;&gt; But\nsometimes those types of things, and\n\n1398\n01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.250\nI don't know may be standard in\nyour industry at this point.\n\n1399\n01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:55.030\nBut those types of things could be that\nlittle piece of you've got to do business\n\n1400\n01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.650\nwith them because they're so\neasy to get into, your in and out quickly.\n\n1401\n01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.550\nAnd they will even text you and\ntell you your drive time.\n\n1402\n01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:04.270\nI'm so busy I don't have\ntime to think about that.\n\n1403\n01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.020\nOther related pieces of heaven and hell.\n\n1404\n01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.960\nWhat else can we think about?\n\n1405\n01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.977\nCome on, you guys all go to the dentist.\n\n1406\n01:06:07.977 --> 01:06:09.880\nThis is not just me up here talking.\n\n1407\n01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.385\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] right now as far as that\nthe only thing helping is really for\n\n1408\n01:06:14.385 --> 01:06:18.735\nthe most part, we don't have anyone\nthat doesn't want to see us,\n\n1409\n01:06:18.735 --> 01:06:21.620\nbecause we hit every one of those things.\n\n1410\n01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:26.864\nLike we humbly have no competition when\nit comes to providing those things.\n\n1411\n01:06:26.864 --> 01:06:32.800\nThe only thing that we run into is\nthat for my heaven-hell is insurance.\n\n1412\n01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.456\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Dental insurance.\n\n1413\n01:06:34.456 --> 01:06:39.407\nWhich ties into the unaffordability part.\n\n1414\n01:06:39.407 --> 01:06:44.280\nAnd it has nothing to do with it because\ngeneral insurance is not really insurance.\n\n1415\n01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It provides no catastrophic thing for\n\n1416\n01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:51.708\nwhat these guys help people\nwith every single day.\n\n1417\n01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:56.330\nPeople it's like you're buying insurance\nfor getting oil changes in your car, or\n\n1418\n01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:57.300\nI need a new muffler.\n\n1419\n01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.020\nAnd it makes no sense.\n\n1420\n01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:03.454\nBut they let that dictate where they\ngo to because that's the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1421\n01:07:03.454 --> 01:07:07.380\nSo that's a big,\nwe've managed to weed through that.\n\n1422\n01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.609\nIt just makes it frustrating.\n\n1423\n01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.138\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's, I mean,\n\n1424\n01:07:11.138 --> 01:07:13.040\na lot of systems do that.\n\n1425\n01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.670\nWe've been very successful.\n\n1426\n01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:19.560\nBut it has limited us to be able to help\nas many people as we'd like to help.\n\n1427\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nBecause they're just going,\n\n1428\n01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:25.930\nthey're calling their insurance company\nfirst and saying who am I covered with.\n\n1429\n01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:27.930\nAnd if you're not on that plan,\n\n1430\n01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.298\nthey're just going to\nwhoever they're covered with.\n\n1431\n01:07:29.298 --> 01:07:32.900\nThat's interesting.\n\n1432\n01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.620\nIt sounds like though that you guys\nare doing a pretty good job with the word\n\n1433\n01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.320\nof mouthpiece, though.\n\n1434\n01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:42.520\nBecause that's what's gonna\ninterrupt that right there, right?\n\n1435\n01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.610\nWould you say most of the people\ncome to you can afford you?\n\n1436\n01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.400\nOr is that insurance\npiece really important?\n\n1437\n01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.297\n&gt;&gt; The insurance, we have a lot\nof people that just go, well,\n\n1438\n01:07:51.297 --> 01:07:52.900\nI just need to go where my\ninsurance will cover it.\n\n1439\n01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n1440\n01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:58.815\n&gt;&gt; And even though sometimes it's not even\na lot of money [CROSSTALK] that portion or\n\n1441\n01:07:58.815 --> 01:07:59.539\nwhatever.\n\n1442\n01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:04.540\nHealthcare in general is difficult as\nfar as there are affordability portions.\n\n1443\n01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.800\nWe have a lot of things in place\nto try to make it more affordable.\n\n1444\n01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Like payment plans and things?\n\n1445\n01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of things like that.\n\n1446\n01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.370\nAm I the cheapest guy in town?\n\n1447\n01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.600\nAbsolutely not.\n\n1448\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Well you shouldn't be for\nwhat you're doing.\n\n1449\n01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.680\n&gt;&gt; No, I mean, exactly.\n\n1450\n01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.550\nAnd it's not, but it's, and\nit's not even that we're expensive,\n\n1451\n01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:24.300\nit's just other places are cheap,\nbut that's what you get.\n\n1452\n01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, and that's another great\nway to divide the wheat from the chaff.\n\n1453\n01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.140\nWe don't want those people in our,\n\n1454\n01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:32.475\nbecause now you have to start compromising\nwho you are in order to meet that pricing.\n\n1455\n01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n1456\n01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we have\n\n1457\n01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.398\ndone a good job of not doing.\n\n1458\n01:08:35.398 --> 01:08:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n1459\n01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.300\nAnd that's even something, and again, I\ndon't know your company or your business.\n\n1460\n01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.400\nBut even elevating that message just\na bit, sometimes we get really scared\n\n1461\n01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.650\nbecause we're trying to talk to\neverybody in that affordability section.\n\n1462\n01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:56.440\nBut sometimes it's like no,\nthis is who we are and we are up here.\n\n1463\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.190\nWithout saying it,\nI need to get that feeling that\n\n1464\n01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:05.010\nif I wanna have amazing dental surgery or\nthe cosmetic surgery,\n\n1465\n01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:09.200\nI need to be a little scared\ngoing to the other guy.\n\n1466\n01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.960\nIt needs to be worth it to come to you,\nyou know what I mean?\n\n1467\n01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.710\nAnd a lot of times when\nwe have a higher price.\n\n1468\n01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:14.730\nIf I buy a Mercedes,\n\n1469\n01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:20.010\nI have a certain expectation what that's\ngonna deliver to me versus a Yugo, right?\n\n1470\n01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:20.510\nSo that's good.\n\n1471\n01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.380\nOkay, those are good.\n\n1472\n01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:22.900\nThose are good.\n\n1473\n01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.570\nSo it sounds like you're surrounding\nthat pretty well, that heaven and hell.\n\n1474\n01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:30.100\nBut that's something you guys\ncan continue to brainstorm on.\n\n1475\n01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.550\nI don't know what else\nthere could be there.\n\n1476\n01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:33.640\nI mean, you could go crazy.\n\n1477\n01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.229\nYou could do child care.\n\n1478\n01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:37.480\nI mean, you could get really nuts.\n\n1479\n01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.145\nHow long are people usually in\nyour office for, for a procedure?\n\n1480\n01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:43.480\nIs this like hours, or is this like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1481\n01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.144\n&gt;&gt; It's a while.\n\n1482\n01:09:44.144 --> 01:09:45.544\nOkay, go it, got.\n\n1483\n01:09:45.544 --> 01:09:47.900\nOkay, cool, that's good.\n\n1484\n01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:48.400\nWho else?\n\n1485\n01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.350\nAnybody else wanna share?\n\n1486\n01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:52.183\nYeah?\n\n1487\n01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:57.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the customers we serve there's\nresearchers and there's engineers.\n\n1488\n01:09:57.385 --> 01:09:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n1489\n01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Almost everyone we deal with has at\nleast six to ten years of higher ed.\n\n1490\n01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.198\nThese are not people that can\ngo to a cocktail party and\n\n1491\n01:10:07.198 --> 01:10:10.990\nexplain what they do without\na lot of boring math.\n\n1492\n01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:14.258\nThere Heaven is the Nobel Prize or\na grant.\n\n1493\n01:10:14.258 --> 01:10:20.890\nOn the engineering side it's\nlanding that tech advantage,\n\n1494\n01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:25.840\nor that pack of technology,\nand [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1495\n01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.667\nTheir Hell is lost data,\nthe research guys,\n\n1496\n01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:33.849\nany lost data, or downtime.\n\n1497\n01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:36.055\nThe semiconductor industry,\n\n1498\n01:10:36.055 --> 01:10:40.306\nthey measure downtime in\nthousands of dollars per minute.\n\n1499\n01:10:40.306 --> 01:10:43.555\nThe wafers they put out,\nit's a six figure product.\n\n1500\n01:10:43.555 --> 01:10:47.006\nSo downtime is huge.\n\n1501\n01:10:47.006 --> 01:10:50.050\nSo for us it's delivery.\n\n1502\n01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.480\nIt's on time delivery.\n\n1503\n01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.420\nIt's being agile.\n\n1504\n01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.450\nIt's also getting weird stuff stuff.\n\n1505\n01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:02.150\nIn other words, there's a lot of\nstandard parts that you get and,\n\n1506\n01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.000\nnot to be xenophobic, but\nyou can't get it from China.\n\n1507\n01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.260\nIt's not the thing that\nyou can just import.\n\n1508\n01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:17.240\nWe specialize in getting the thing that's\nstandard but it needs a whole over here.\n\n1509\n01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.805\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, right.\n\n1510\n01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:20.070\n&gt;&gt; Or it needs a certain tolerance.\n\n1511\n01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.850\nAnd our customers,\nthey measure the world in microns.\n\n1512\n01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:28.770\nSo being able to depend on our things, and\n\n1513\n01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.860\nget that they're gonna be\nthere when they need them.\n\n1514\n01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.429\nOur customers have contracts that\nthey get penalties for late delivery.\n\n1515\n01:11:35.429 --> 01:11:38.465\nSo the OEMs that we serve,\nthey're under contract and\n\n1516\n01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:42.034\nthey're going to get fined by\ntheir customer if they're late.\n\n1517\n01:11:42.034 --> 01:11:42.836\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n1518\n01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:46.082\n&gt;&gt; So if we cause that\nproblem in the supply chain,\n\n1519\n01:11:46.082 --> 01:11:48.870\nthey need to know that we're there.\n\n1520\n01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n1521\n01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:53.684\nOkay, so what about,\nlet's take that beyond that product piece.\n\n1522\n01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:54.420\nDelivery.\n\n1523\n01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.200\nDoes it come in a truck?\n\n1524\n01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.051\nDoes it come in a box?\n\n1525\n01:11:56.051 --> 01:11:56.930\nDoes it come on a ship?\n\n1526\n01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:58.909\nHow do they get it?\n\n1527\n01:11:58.909 --> 01:11:59.671\n&gt;&gt; All of the above.\n\n1528\n01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:00.937\n&gt;&gt; All of the above.\n\n1529\n01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:01.611\nOkay.\n\n1530\n01:12:01.611 --> 01:12:02.950\nDo they get to choose that delivery?\n\n1531\n01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:07.190\nIs there ever a paying point\nin that delivery that we could\n\n1532\n01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.690\nsomehow make that better, faster for them?\n\n1533\n01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:11.740\nOr no, that's already dialed in?\n\n1534\n01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.720\n&gt;&gt; No, actually, it is a paying point.\n\n1535\n01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.550\nSome of them specify right down to\n\n1536\n01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:19.030\nthe color of the format that you deliver\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n1537\n01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Almost made to that inspection,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1538\n01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.360\n&gt;&gt; They will refuse an order if\nall the eyes aren't dotted and\n\n1539\n01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.800\nthe t's aren't crossed they can\nactually turn away from it.\n\n1540\n01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.990\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Simply because\n\n1541\n01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:31.440\nit's in the wrong color box.\n\n1542\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep okay.\nAnd when they open that box do they know\n\n1543\n01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:33.618\nwhat to do with it?\n\n1544\n01:12:33.618 --> 01:12:36.120\n&gt;&gt; It's a [INAUDIBLE] good question\n\n1545\n01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.020\nthe guy opens the box not necessarily-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n1546\n01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.920\n&gt;&gt; but the people who use it-\n&gt;&gt; Do.\n\n1547\n01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:46.560\n&gt;&gt; They have to inventory it, or transport\nit sometimes from [INAUDIBLE] that box.\n\n1548\n01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.300\nIt has to be clean-room-ready.\n\n1549\n01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n1550\n01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:53.220\n&gt;&gt; So certain things, it has to be\npackaged in a way that, in our world,\n\n1551\n01:12:53.220 --> 01:13:00.450\na fingerprint is half a day of trying to\npull those, that fingerprint off of us.\n\n1552\n01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:02.200\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\nSo do you have some sort of system in\n\n1553\n01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.660\nyour process where it says do not touch,\nor do not fingerprint,\n\n1554\n01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:11.150\nare you helping them with that potential\npain point, do you help them with that?\n\n1555\n01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah in some cases we do [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So it's wrapped, or\n\n1556\n01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:16.911\nit's somehow covered and all that\n&gt;&gt; Yes, special packaging instructions for\n\n1557\n01:13:16.911 --> 01:13:17.930\nsome customers\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n1558\n01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:22.230\nOkay, what else do I have that's a related\npain point, is it how I find you?\n\n1559\n01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:25.420\nIs it how many phone calls\nI have to have with you,\n\n1560\n01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.720\nhow many project discussions I have\nwith you to get my specs right?\n\n1561\n01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.060\nOr where else in the process of getting\nthis done could I potentially have pain?\n\n1562\n01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.610\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times the person\n\n1563\n01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:40.989\nwho specified the product isn't\nthe one whose ordering it.\n\n1564\n01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:44.980\nSo painpoint is that you have a purchasing\nperson they're required to get,\n\n1565\n01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.420\nlike maybe three quotes or so\n\n1566\n01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:53.140\non and sometimes it's about the lead\ntime more than it is the price.\n\n1567\n01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.580\n&gt;&gt; So how can you, we were talking\nabout this with someone else yesterday,\n\n1568\n01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.878\nhow can you make those purchasing\nagents love you, right?\n\n1569\n01:13:59.878 --> 01:14:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Jellybeans.\n\n1570\n01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:04.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jellybeans work.\n\n1571\n01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.532\nI like jellybeans,\npurchasing agents do like to eat.\n\n1572\n01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:12.180\nYou know, is it the return on the quote,\nhow quickly you get it to them.\n\n1573\n01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.490\nIs it your deep understanding\nof what needs to happen\n\n1574\n01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:19.950\nbecause of your expertise so\nthey don't have to explain it as much.\n\n1575\n01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:21.300\nI don't know, so.\n\n1576\n01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n1577\n01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and yes.\n\n1578\n01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.953\nOkay, got it.\n\n1579\n01:14:24.953 --> 01:14:26.401\nGot it.\n\n1580\n01:14:26.401 --> 01:14:27.560\nCool.\n\n1581\n01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.420\nSo you guys have this dialed\nin pretty good it sounds like.\n\n1582\n01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:32.225\n&gt;&gt; We've got plenty to do.\n\n1583\n01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:32.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got plenty to do?\n\n1584\n01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.450\nCause I was gonna say there's a lot of\nmoving parts in what you just described of\n\n1585\n01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:37.800\nthat process.\n\n1586\n01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.960\nSo the more we can take out that pain and\nput that thanks for\n\n1587\n01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.550\nthe glass slippers moment,\nthe more people, again, real excited.\n\n1588\n01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:46.370\nBecause whoever you're working with,\nthese researchers,\n\n1589\n01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:49.570\nthe scientists, the purchasing agents,\nthey steal the water cooler, right?\n\n1590\n01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.730\nThey're still talking\nto somebody somewhere.\n\n1591\n01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.360\nPurchasing agents have the headache of\nfilling out the paperwork and waiting for\n\n1592\n01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.850\nsomebody to get back to them, and I wish\nthis guy would have given me that quote so\n\n1593\n01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:00.190\nI could get this stack off my desk and\ngo home for the day, or whatever.\n\n1594\n01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:03.400\nSo the more we can make their life easier.\n\n1595\n01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.070\nthe more you're always in that rotation of\nthe three people that have to quote and\n\n1596\n01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.040\nthose types of things, right?\n\n1597\n01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right.\n\n1598\n01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.500\nYou gotta be the fairy godmother for\nthe purchasing agent.\n\n1599\n01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.450\nBut for us, if we can get to that.\n\n1600\n01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.410\n&gt;&gt; End user?\n\n1601\n01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:21.010\n&gt;&gt; The end user, but\nyou can't always get to that person.\n\n1602\n01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:21.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But a lot of times,\n\n1603\n01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:24.840\nthey're just telling their first name,\nand why are you buying from us.\n\n1604\n01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.810\nIt's cuz this guy told me to buy this.\n\n1605\n01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, yeah, but\n\n1606\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.600\nI'm just saying you have to keep in\nmind all those target audiences.\n\n1607\n01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.480\nCuz you're right,\nif you can't get to that end guy,\n\n1608\n01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.430\nyou sure want a purchasing\nagent on your side, right?\n\n1609\n01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.420\nBut if you can get to the end guy,\nyeah, he'll pull it through.\n\n1610\n01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a purchasing agent might get\nyou an appointment with this guy who\n\n1611\n01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.760\ndoesn't want to see anybody.\n\n1612\n01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay exactly, especially with the kind\nof work you guys do, so, okay good.\n\n1613\n01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:48.060\nAll right guys, let's move on cuz we're\ngonna start pulling this all together and\n\n1614\n01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.090\nmaking a nice,\npretty story with some results.\n\n1615\n01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:55.250\nSo, let's talk about delivering word\nof mouth worthy customer experience.\n\n1616\n01:15:55.250 --> 01:16:01.280\nSo, customer experience guys is the\ncompetitive battleground of this century.\n\n1617\n01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.600\nSomeone was asking about upcoming trends,\n\n1618\n01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.535\nthis is probably the biggest\none we've got, right?\n\n1619\n01:16:05.535 --> 01:16:09.319\nSo there's all sorts of also little\nmicrotrends that we can talk about in\n\n1620\n01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:11.215\nsegmentation and stuff like this.\n\n1621\n01:16:11.215 --> 01:16:16.090\n86% of B2B buyers say they will pay\nmore for customer experience, right?\n\n1622\n01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.030\nAre, I gonna pay more for\nthat experience you're giving me.\n\n1623\n01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:22.510\nIt's even higher in B2C which is\nwhat you're working in By 2020,\n\n1624\n01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:28.130\nit's predicted that customer experience\nwill be the key brand differentiator for\n\n1625\n01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:32.840\nB2B companies, it's gonna overtake\nboth price and product, okay?\n\n1626\n01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.740\nSo this goes back to Starbucks,\nI can have an okay cup of coffee but\n\n1627\n01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:42.830\nif I have an experience\npeople will choose my company\n\n1628\n01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.410\nover someone else who may\neven have a better product.\n\n1629\n01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:49.150\nThis is more important to people\nthan the product in many times.\n\n1630\n01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.520\nAnd we wanna define the customer\njourney that matters.\n\n1631\n01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.936\nIf you guys haven't started\ndefining your customer experience,\n\n1632\n01:16:54.936 --> 01:16:58.718\nlet me just tell you one of the pitfalls\nthat a lot of times people run into,\n\n1633\n01:16:58.718 --> 01:17:00.500\nis they define it by touchpoints.\n\n1634\n01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.296\nAnd what happens is the customer\nstarts experience And we survey,\n\n1635\n01:17:04.296 --> 01:17:09.041\nthere's been all these surveys done of top\nCMOs of companies who are really engaged\n\n1636\n01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:13.177\nin this customer experience process,\none of the biggest indicators for\n\n1637\n01:17:13.177 --> 01:17:17.178\ncustomer experience success that\ngoes directly to your bottom line is\n\n1638\n01:17:17.178 --> 01:17:22.350\nhaving omni-channel consistency and\ngiving people this customer journey.\n\n1639\n01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:24.360\nNot a great touch point\nwhen I come in the door and\n\n1640\n01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.870\ngreat touch point during the sale.\n\n1641\n01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:28.030\nAnd a great touch point\nover here in post-sale, or\n\n1642\n01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:30.290\nwhatever all these\ndifferent touch points are.\n\n1643\n01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:34.260\nIt needs to be all the way through,\neveryone's talking in the same voice.\n\n1644\n01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.330\nIf I'm ordering something,\n\n1645\n01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.980\nI can order it online the same\nway I can order it in the store.\n\n1646\n01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.280\nIf I have a customer service problem,\n\n1647\n01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.160\nthe customer service is gonna be\nhandled in person, on the phone,\n\n1648\n01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.160\nthrough live chat, through the internet\nall the same way in the same voice so\n\n1649\n01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.770\nno matter where I am I'm not thinking\nI'm not gonna go back to the store and\n\n1650\n01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:57.070\nfigure this out we don't ant that in\nthe customer journey, it's a journey.\n\n1651\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.930\nAnd the best way to do this is to allow\nyour employees to give you the solution.\n\n1652\n01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:06.330\nWho's on the front line\nwith our customers?\n\n1653\n01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:07.530\nOur staff, right?\n\n1654\n01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:10.340\nOur employees,\nthe people who are working in our company.\n\n1655\n01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.360\nSo they're the people who need to be\nempowered to come up with your customer\n\n1656\n01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.430\nexperience, ideas, and strategies.\n\n1657\n01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.415\nSo as leaders,\nwhat we need to do is said look.\n\n1658\n01:18:18.415 --> 01:18:21.695\nLook customer experience is\nnow important to this company.\n\n1659\n01:18:21.695 --> 01:18:25.385\nWe are going to start figuring it out and\nthere's different ways to measure it.\n\n1660\n01:18:25.385 --> 01:18:29.705\nSo we're going to set the pace, but I need\nyou guys to tell me what we need to do.\n\n1661\n01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.385\nThen we can start measuring it,\nand if that doesn't work,\n\n1662\n01:18:32.385 --> 01:18:33.905\nwe can try something different.\n\n1663\n01:18:33.905 --> 01:18:34.605\nRight?\n\n1664\n01:18:34.605 --> 01:18:37.145\nSo your staff are the people\nwho know this best.\n\n1665\n01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:42.940\nThe root cause of poor customer experience\nalways stems From the inside, right?\n\n1666\n01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.540\nAnd that's something that your team\nneeds to understand really well.\n\n1667\n01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:46.930\nIt's not the vendor,\n\n1668\n01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:52.260\nit's not the person who didn't deliver on\ntime, it's not the dog ate my homework.\n\n1669\n01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.190\nAll that kind of stuff,\n\n1670\n01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:56.530\nwhen it comes to customer experience,\nwe have solutions for those.\n\n1671\n01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:59.300\nSo if the vendor doesn't deliver on time,\nit's not the vendor's fault.\n\n1672\n01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.180\nWe have a solution to handle that.\n\n1673\n01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.260\nThe dog ate your homework.\n\n1674\n01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.140\nWe've already thought of that.\n\n1675\n01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.910\nWe have a solution for that.\n\n1676\n01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:09.770\nBecause no one wants to hear it wasn't my\nfault, but we'll figure it out, right?\n\n1677\n01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:11.450\nThey wanna know that you gotta solution.\n\n1678\n01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:13.346\nThat yep, you know,\nwe're half a day late, but\n\n1679\n01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:15.402\nhere's how we're gonna do\nit on the back end [SOUND].\n\n1680\n01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:17.620\nOkay, great customer experience.\n\n1681\n01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.720\nWrap me in this journey.\n\n1682\n01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.720\nOkay, so let's do a case study.\n\n1683\n01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.330\nLet's pull in pillar number\none which is our why,\n\n1684\n01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.340\npillar number two which is\nunderstanding our customer's heaven and\n\n1685\n01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:33.330\nhell, and pillar number three which\nis getting into customer experience.\n\n1686\n01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:37.260\nAnd we're gonna look at two different\ncompanies that do DNA testing for\n\n1687\n01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:39.350\nhereditary cancer.\n\n1688\n01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:43.715\nSo I'm gonna be a, let's just say,\nI'm the target audience who,\n\n1689\n01:19:43.715 --> 01:19:48.386\nI'm a woman, my aunt, my uncle or\nmy ant my uncle, my grandmother, and\n\n1690\n01:19:48.386 --> 01:19:52.550\nmy mom all have, had cancer,\nbreast cancer, ovarian cancer.\n\n1691\n01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:54.041\nMaybe they died from this.\n\n1692\n01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:56.400\nI'm at great risk for\nhereditary cancer, right?\n\n1693\n01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:01.497\nSo I now want to take a proactive approach\nand do some testing to see if I'm at risk.\n\n1694\n01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:02.473\nGood?\n\n1695\n01:20:02.473 --> 01:20:06.562\nAll right, so we're gonna see one company\nwho has dialed in these three pillars and\n\n1696\n01:20:06.562 --> 01:20:08.842\nthey now have that iconic\nbrand foundation and\n\n1697\n01:20:08.842 --> 01:20:11.377\nthey're on their way to\nbecoming an iconic brand.\n\n1698\n01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:14.200\nWe're gonna see another company that at\n\n1699\n01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.840\nthe surface doesn't look like\nthey're doing really anything wrong.\n\n1700\n01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.650\nAnd we're gonna point out some things\nwhere they're really leaving dollars on\n\n1701\n01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:25.850\nthe table They're creating\nconfusion in their messaging, and\n\n1702\n01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:30.390\nthey're not igniting that tribe\naround them that says you get me,\n\n1703\n01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:33.020\nyou get my pain, and\nyou're representing me.\n\n1704\n01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.280\nOkay?\n\n1705\n01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.679\nSo first of all,\nlet's think about heaven and hell.\n\n1706\n01:20:37.679 --> 01:20:39.540\nThere's all sorts of pieces of heaven and\nhell.\n\n1707\n01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:44.132\nSo the heaven that I want, if I'm at fear,\nI'm at risk of cancer, is what?\n\n1708\n01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:46.696\nI'm gonna avoid cancer, first of all.\n\n1709\n01:20:46.696 --> 01:20:49.829\nI hope I'm not at risk.\n\n1710\n01:20:49.829 --> 01:20:53.751\nIf I am at risk, I wanna make sure it's\ncompletely gone and eradicated, right?\n\n1711\n01:20:53.751 --> 01:20:58.280\nI don't want cancer to\nchange my life outcome.\n\n1712\n01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.600\nWe all have a vision of our life, and\nour life is ending a long time from now.\n\n1713\n01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.390\nThat's what I still want.\n\n1714\n01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:08.070\nI wanna make sure that any\nprocedure is quick and painless.\n\n1715\n01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:10.900\nI want information about that procedure,\nwhat to expect.\n\n1716\n01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.530\nI wanna know someone's\ngonna help me through this.\n\n1717\n01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:16.590\nI probably have questions if\ninsurance is gonna cover this test.\n\n1718\n01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:18.350\nWhat do I do afterwards, right?\n\n1719\n01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:21.270\nThose are all those things I\nwant answered because my hell\n\n1720\n01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:23.730\nis that I'm scared there's\nsomething wrong with me.\n\n1721\n01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:27.800\nAnd how will I tell my family?\n\n1722\n01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.370\nAnd why me?\n\n1723\n01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:30.000\nWhy's this happening to me?\n\n1724\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.460\nWhy do I have to be different?\n\n1725\n01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:34.910\nWhy do I have to be from\nthe family that has this gene?\n\n1726\n01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:36.590\nWill it hurt?\n\n1727\n01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:38.570\nWhat do I do if I get a positive result?\n\n1728\n01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:39.140\nGee, now what?\n\n1729\n01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.340\nWhat doctor should I consult?\n\n1730\n01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.840\nAm I going to my general practitioner?\n\n1731\n01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.030\nOBGYN?\nDo I have to find an oncologist?\n\n1732\n01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:47.360\nDo I have an oncologist?\n\n1733\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.110\nRight?\n\n1734\n01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:49.810\nAnd then what happens next?\n\n1735\n01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:52.160\nIs this a quick thing, like I need to\nget this taken care of right away?\n\n1736\n01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.040\nMaybe I was planning on\nhaving more children.\n\n1737\n01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.568\nShould I wait five years?\n\n1738\n01:21:54.568 --> 01:21:56.170\nDo I need to have it in five months?\n\n1739\n01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.369\nWhat's going on?\n\n1740\n01:21:57.369 --> 01:21:59.024\nAnd then,\nhow do I find the right treatment?\n\n1741\n01:21:59.024 --> 01:22:00.384\nWhat is the treatment?\n\n1742\n01:22:00.384 --> 01:22:01.875\nAnd there's a million different things.\n\n1743\n01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.860\nThis is a pretty big heaven and\nhell situation for this person.\n\n1744\n01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.620\nAll right, so\nlet's go to company number one.\n\n1745\n01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.910\nIf you go to their website,\nthis is what you'll see.\n\n1746\n01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:11.440\nAnd I'm just gonna flip through this\nreal quick because it's a slide show.\n\n1747\n01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.930\nSo you'll see a slide show, and\nthere's about a dozen people.\n\n1748\n01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:21.730\nAnd they have this headline, and\nthe headline does not say DNA testing\n\n1749\n01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.970\nhere or your test now, does it?\n\n1750\n01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:25.750\nWhat does it say?\n\n1751\n01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.020\nBecause we're beautifully\ndifferent outside and in.\n\n1752\n01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.210\nWhat's my hell?\n\n1753\n01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.912\nMy hell is that I'm different,\nthere's something wrong with me, why me?\n\n1754\n01:22:36.912 --> 01:22:38.398\nRight?\n\n1755\n01:22:38.398 --> 01:22:42.916\nI've got some weird gene thing going on\nthat's gonna make me potentially sick\n\n1756\n01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:43.540\nor worse.\n\n1757\n01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:49.400\nThey are saying no you don't,\nyou're okay, we're all different.\n\n1758\n01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.330\nWe're all beautifully different,\nwe get you.\n\n1759\n01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:54.040\n' And that feels good because\nthey're talking to my heart, right?\n\n1760\n01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.510\nNot my head.\n\n1761\n01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:57.335\nAnd then, what else have they done?\n\n1762\n01:22:57.335 --> 01:23:00.475\nAnd I just want to show you how why\nbring this why through the execution.\n\n1763\n01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:01.761\nWe're all different.\n\n1764\n01:23:01.761 --> 01:23:02.998\nWe're all beautifully different.\n\n1765\n01:23:02.998 --> 01:23:04.033\nWhat are we seeing?\n\n1766\n01:23:04.033 --> 01:23:06.314\nDifferent people.\n\n1767\n01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:09.547\nThey're tall, they're small,\nthey're men, they're women,\n\n1768\n01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:12.680\nthey're different colors,\nthey're different ages, right?\n\n1769\n01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.871\nSo, does that support the headline?\n\n1770\n01:23:14.871 --> 01:23:19.230\nAnd does that support\ntheir customers paying?\n\n1771\n01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:20.800\nAbsolutely.\n\n1772\n01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.970\nOkay, so what are these people wearing?\n\n1773\n01:23:24.703 --> 01:23:26.700\nWhat are they wearing?\n\n1774\n01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.640\nNo shirt, they're in their birthday suit.\n\n1775\n01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.140\nWhy?\n\n1776\n01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:34.264\nCuz if you're in a birthday suit,\nwhat happens?\n\n1777\n01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:35.828\nWhat happens if we all\njust take our clothes off?\n\n1778\n01:23:35.828 --> 01:23:37.601\nWe're all just the same, right?\n\n1779\n01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:39.690\nIt's really boiling us\ndown to our essence.\n\n1780\n01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:42.560\nAnd isn't that what this company is about,\nour DNA?\n\n1781\n01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.480\nThat's all we are, right?\n\n1782\n01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.020\nWe're all just DNA.\n\n1783\n01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.280\nThat is a beautiful, beautiful way,\n\n1784\n01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.610\nsomeone has really thought\nthrough the execution of this.\n\n1785\n01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.171\nTo bring in that why to say look,\nwe're all the same.\n\n1786\n01:23:54.171 --> 01:23:56.484\nAnd when we're in our birthday suit,\nwe're really the same.\n\n1787\n01:23:56.484 --> 01:24:00.212\nNow, imagine this woman was\nin a hot pink tank top.\n\n1788\n01:24:00.212 --> 01:24:03.599\nAs a woman I might go,\nI wouldn't wear a hot pink tank top.\n\n1789\n01:24:03.599 --> 01:24:05.770\nI automatically start having\na more visceral reaction.\n\n1790\n01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.655\nWhat if she's in a pin\nstriped business suit?\n\n1791\n01:24:07.655 --> 01:24:08.960\nOops, that's not me.\n\n1792\n01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.980\nSo also by taking their clothes\noff we don't have pre-judgements.\n\n1793\n01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.990\nAnd they're looking straight at us.\n\n1794\n01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.570\nHave you noticed that?\n\n1795\n01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:17.940\nThey're looking straight at us.\n\n1796\n01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:20.220\nThey are connecting with me, the viewer.\n\n1797\n01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:24.390\nSo these are all executional pieces,\nguys, that were done very purposely\n\n1798\n01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:28.950\nto illustrate this company's why and\nto connect with that customer in a way\n\n1799\n01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:33.470\nthat's gonna be emotional and create word\nof mouth, that iconic brand All right.\n\n1800\n01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:35.120\nSo, what happens next?\n\n1801\n01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.410\nAs we scroll down the page we get below\non the website, we see these four boxes.\n\n1802\n01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:43.110\nNote the colour, and\neven note the colour on the app here.\n\n1803\n01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:48.910\nThis is grey, a sort of some backlighting,\nsome spotlight, it's warm and\n\n1804\n01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:53.710\nthis is not crayon colours but\nit's approachable.\n\n1805\n01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:57.820\nI'm scared,\nwe need to make this approachable, right?\n\n1806\n01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.030\nAnd what are these people doing?\n\n1807\n01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:01.762\nAgain, they all look like you or me,\n\n1808\n01:25:01.762 --> 01:25:06.258\nthey're all looking directly at us,\nand it's very easy for\n\n1809\n01:25:06.258 --> 01:25:11.740\nme to self select and go into the blue\nbox here which is hereditary cancer.\n\n1810\n01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.938\nWhoops, did I do something wrong?\n\n1811\n01:25:12.938 --> 01:25:14.303\nOkay.\n\n1812\n01:25:14.303 --> 01:25:18.720\nSo, I push on the blue box and I go into\nhereditary cancer and guess what happens?\n\n1813\n01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.830\nI come here.\n\n1814\n01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:22.230\nSo the woman that was behind that\nblue overlay, now she's here and\n\n1815\n01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:25.900\nshe's looking straight at us and\nshe looks like everyday woman, right?\n\n1816\n01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:28.274\nIs there a woman in the room\nwho can't identify with her?\n\n1817\n01:25:28.274 --> 01:25:31.735\nShe's happy, she could be a corporate\nwoman, she could be a business owner,\n\n1818\n01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:34.440\nshe could be a stay at home mom,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n1819\n01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.319\nShe's in something that\nany of us would wear.\n\n1820\n01:25:36.319 --> 01:25:38.337\nShe's sitting on this patio and\nwhat's behind her?\n\n1821\n01:25:38.337 --> 01:25:41.349\nLife, greenery, flowers.\n\n1822\n01:25:41.349 --> 01:25:43.166\nThat's life, that's what that symbolizes.\n\n1823\n01:25:43.166 --> 01:25:44.490\nShe's not sitting in a room at a desk.\n\n1824\n01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:47.060\nThat's what we wanna hold on to.\n\n1825\n01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.100\nAnd what does the headline say?\n\n1826\n01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.540\nWe're gonna change the course of cancer.\n\n1827\n01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.220\nSo, what's my heaven?\n\n1828\n01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.730\nBut I'm going to change\nthe course of cancer,\n\n1829\n01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:58.070\nit's not going to affect my life, right?\n\n1830\n01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:01.250\nHeck yeah, that's a rally cry guys,\nyou got me now.\n\n1831\n01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:05.250\nHow many clicks did it\ntake me to get there?\n\n1832\n01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:09.230\nOne, boom I'm in and then it goes\non to say amend your inheritance,\n\n1833\n01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.380\npass down from generation to generation,\n\n1834\n01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.300\ncancer is a form of inheritance most\nfamilies don't like to talk about.\n\n1835\n01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:16.240\nAnd isn't that what's going on?\n\n1836\n01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.780\nI feel all alone.\n\n1837\n01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.440\nAnd I'm scared.\n\n1838\n01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.340\nI don't know how to tell my kids.\n\n1839\n01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.220\nI don't know how to tell my husband.\n\n1840\n01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.790\nI don't know how to tell my girlfriends,\nright?\n\n1841\n01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:25.120\nBut they're saying, we get that,\nwe understand what you're going through.\n\n1842\n01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.500\nOkay, and there's a whole bunch more of\nthese pages to this particular pages.\n\n1843\n01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.050\nYou're going down.\n\n1844\n01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:31.880\nThey show you a whole bunch\nof tests that they test for.\n\n1845\n01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.380\nAnd then, they give you some icons.\n\n1846\n01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.350\nIt's like click here, here, here, and\n\n1847\n01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:38.000\nthis is how easy it's\ngonna be to take the test.\n\n1848\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.950\nBut what I really wanted to get to\nwas more of what we're getting into\n\n1849\n01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:43.060\nthat customer experience piece.\n\n1850\n01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:48.110\nWhere this company has gone above and\nbeyond just providing the test.\n\n1851\n01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:50.380\nThey also say testing in insurance.\n\n1852\n01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.850\nYou got questions about insurance?\n\n1853\n01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.660\nNo

with.\n\n1858\n01:27:01.210 --> 01:27:02.112\nThat's a nightmare.\n\n1859\n01:27:02.112 --> 01:27:03.475\nThey're gonna help me with that?\n\n1860\n01:27:03.475 --> 01:27:06.329\nThank you,\nyou understand my heaven and hell.\n\n1861\n01:27:06.329 --> 01:27:08.157\nAnd what's my experience now?\n\n1862\n01:27:08.157 --> 01:27:09.227\nIs it word of mouth worthy?\n\n1863\n01:27:09.227 --> 01:27:10.180\nYeah.\n\n1864\n01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.789\nWhat else?\n\n1865\n01:27:11.789 --> 01:27:14.196\nThey say we're here for you.\n\n1866\n01:27:14.196 --> 01:27:17.769\nIf testing reveals

you figure out what to do next.\n\n1869\n01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.445\nWasn't that my hell?\n\n1870\n01:27:25.445 --> 01:27:27.027\nI don't know what to do next.\n\n1871\n01:27:27.027 --> 01:27:27.950\nWhat's my heaven?\n\n1872\n01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:30.430\nYou're gonna hold my hand through it.\n\n1873\n01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:35.180\nAnd they're talking to me in language that\nsays if you are genetically predisposed\n\n1874\n01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.800\nwe are gonna help you.\n\n1875\n01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.200\nFor talking to me like a people, right?\n\n1876\n01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.030\nLike, if I was sitting down with\nyou across the table from coffee,\n\n1877\n01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.390\nthat's what I wanna hear from you, right?\n\n1878\n01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:44.600\nBeautiful, beautiful language.\n\n1879\n01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.885\nThis is purpose bill guys.\n\n1880\n01:27:46.885 --> 01:27:50.981\nOkay, so let's go to the About Us page,\nbecause we do have to have an About Us\n\n1881\n01:27:50.981 --> 01:27:55.271\npage and it's important if people ever get\nto it, we want it to well represent us\n\n1882\n01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:59.815\nThis is a great place, of course, for our\nwhy, but you'll see how their why is woven\n\n1883\n01:27:59.815 --> 01:28:03.748\nthroughout the entire messaging of\nthe site What is their About Us page?\n\n1884\n01:28:03.748 --> 01:28:08.390\nDoes it say we are a scientific lab\nthat was founded in blah, blah, blah?\n\n1885\n01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:11.290\nWe are the best of the best\nof the best of the best.\n\n1886\n01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:13.860\nThey don't.\nThey have a belief statement.\n\n1887\n01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:17.140\nWe believe our DNA is our\nsignature on this planet.\n\n1888\n01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.580\nAnd that's why I was asking you guys,\nin your why.\n\n1889\n01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.150\nWhat's your belief?\n\n1890\n01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:23.250\nThat's what that should say there.\n\n1891\n01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:27.900\nWe believe that this sort of process\nin our dentistry is gonna get you\n\n1892\n01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:32.420\nthis lifetime result that you're happy and\nconfident with your smile now, whatever.\n\n1893\n01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:35.630\nAnd we believe that quality of life\nis built through this or whatever,\n\n1894\n01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:37.610\nthat belief statement needs to be there.\n\n1895\n01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:43.070\nWe believe that this holds the answers\nto some of the greatest healthcare\n\n1896\n01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.070\nchallenges of our time.\n\n1897\n01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:48.630\nThat is much bigger than saying we\nbelieve that we can be number one in our\n\n1898\n01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:50.780\nindustry, right?\n\n1899\n01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:54.220\nEvery day, we choose to focus on\nsolutions, to make progress, to inspire.\n\n1900\n01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.744\nWe choose to keep the people we\nhave at the forefront of all we do.\n\n1901\n01:28:57.744 --> 01:28:59.931\nWe are making a choice.\n\n1902\n01:28:59.931 --> 01:29:02.040\nThis is powerful language.\n\n1903\n01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.985\nThis is what ignites your tribe.\n\n1904\n01:29:03.985 --> 01:29:06.680\nThis is what keeps people\ntalking about you.\n\n1905\n01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.600\nThey go on to tell a little bit about the\ncompany but look at the sentence before\n\n1906\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.059\nthe end it says just like you illness,\ndisease and cancer hit close home for us.\n\n1907\n01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.990\nWow, that's powerful, we get you.\n\n1908\n01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.010\nThat's your experience, right?\n\n1909\n01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:22.190\nI get this.\n\n1910\n01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.290\nCuz my dad was sick once.\n\n1911\n01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:25.850\nAnd I know what that feels like.\n\n1912\n01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:29.510\nAnd you start introducing your\ncompany with that I'm like, wow,\n\n1913\n01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:30.530\nyou get me, right?\n\n1914\n01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:34.930\nAnd when you have that\nsense of identification\n\n1915\n01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:39.250\nwith people think of how powerful\nthat is okay, let's move on.\n\n1916\n01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:40.180\nLet's look at company B.\n\n1917\n01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:43.460\nThis is their homepage.\n\n1918\n01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.180\nIt's clean.\n\n1919\n01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.310\nIt's white.\n\n1920\n01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:46.730\nI like clean, white websites.\n\n1921\n01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:47.780\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1922\n01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.560\nVery simple.\n\n1923\n01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.610\nBut in the context of what\nthis company is trying to do,\n\n1924\n01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:55.029\nwhat does white signify\nin the medical community?\n\n1925\n01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:00.970\nSterile, I'm in a hospital,\nI just walked down a hallway.\n\n1926\n01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:06.290\nProbably not as inviting as that really\nwarm grey background that we were looking\n\n1927\n01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:07.700\nat before.\n\n1928\n01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.470\nNow, look at our picture.\n\n1929\n01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.840\nNo one's looking at me.\n\n1930\n01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.920\nThey're looking at their family.\n\n1931\n01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.380\nAt first glance, there's nothing\nwrong with this picture, right?\n\n1932\n01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:18.000\nIt's a family, five hereditary cancer.\n\n1933\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.580\nI might be thinking about\nhaving more children.\n\n1934\n01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.270\nI certainly don't wanna\nleave my children behind.\n\n1935\n01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:25.280\nYeah, okay, there's some connection\nthere but it's not as powerful.\n\n1936\n01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.300\nAnd it's also only speaking to people\nwith young children or families.\n\n1937\n01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.298\nWhat if you're coming here for\nsomething else?\n\n1938\n01:30:31.298 --> 01:30:33.394\nDrug metabolism or something, right?\n\n1939\n01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.070\nThat's not what you wanna see.\n\n1940\n01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:37.370\nSo you're really only\ntalking to one audience.\n\n1941\n01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:41.270\nThey have not really communicated\nas well as the first company.\n\n1942\n01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:42.200\nOkay, what's our headline?\n\n1943\n01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.362\nDiscover your path to feeling better.\n\n1944\n01:30:46.644 --> 01:30:49.130\nI might have heard that you're a cancer,\nI'm not sick.\n\n1945\n01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:53.100\nThat doesn't talk to me, I'm not sick.\n\n1946\n01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:55.540\nWhy are you saying discover\nthe path to feeling better?\n\n1947\n01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.300\nAgain, so now I'm talking to one audience.\n\n1948\n01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.630\nIs this woman with the baby sick?\n\n1949\n01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:01.540\nI don't understand that, right?\n\n1950\n01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:04.130\nSo there's a disconnect between\nthe headline and the image.\n\n1951\n01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:08.873\nNow, we get further and say get your\npersonalized guide to optimal health.\n\n1952\n01:31:08.873 --> 01:31:12.311\nWell, darn, that's gonna be\nawesome because you know what?\n\n1953\n01:31:12.311 --> 01:31:15.226\nI'm worried I have cancer and I think\nthere's gonna be a guidebook out there for\n\n1954\n01:31:15.226 --> 01:31:16.760\noptimal health.\n\n1955\n01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.020\nWho talks that way?\n\n1956\n01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.570\nNever, never, never in the history of man\nhave any of us ever said, called somebody\n\n1957\n01:31:22.570 --> 01:31:25.620\non the phone and said, Sue, I really\nneed a guidebook for optimized health.\n\n1958\n01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.600\nMan, I've been missing that.\n\n1959\n01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.680\nWho talks that way?\n\n1960\n01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.670\nDoctors and scientists, right?\n\n1961\n01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:32.020\nThey're talking to themselves.\n\n1962\n01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.190\nThey're not talking to you and me.\n\n1963\n01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.150\nBut you see how it's accurate,\n\n1964\n01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:39.990\nit's accurate there is no nothing\ninaccurate about what they're doing here.\n\n1965\n01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:42.660\nFirst, just an huge disconnects\nwith how they're trying\n\n1966\n01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.150\nto actually communicate with people.\n\n1967\n01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.720\nAnd they're certainly not\ndrawing this into their brand.\n\n1968\n01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.070\nOkay, and then they go on below that,\nthey're below the fold is not more people,\n\n1969\n01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:54.630\nit's here is why your DNA works and\nthey're starting to give me what?\n\n1970\n01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:55.580\nKnowledge.\n\n1971\n01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:56.590\nWhere am I going?\n\n1972\n01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:57.360\nHere.\n\n1973\n01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.189\nWhat am I doing?\n\n1974\n01:31:58.189 --> 01:32:01.361\nI'm opening up four more tabs pn\nmy web browser and looking for\n\n1975\n01:32:01.361 --> 01:32:03.991\nmore companies that I can\nstart comparing them to.\n\n1976\n01:32:03.991 --> 01:32:06.370\nDo you see what automatically\nstarts happening?\n\n1977\n01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:08.260\nCuz I really don't wanna read all that and\n\n1978\n01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.566\nyou haven't gotten me to go any further\ninto your website at this point.\n\n1979\n01:32:11.566 --> 01:32:15.767\nBut if I do make it down the page, the\nnext thing I see below my little DNA dude\n\n1980\n01:32:15.767 --> 01:32:18.119\nis knowledge is the first step to change.\n\n1981\n01:32:18.119 --> 01:32:20.566\n[SOUND] I'm having a little bit\nof a Charlie Brown moment now.\n\n1982\n01:32:20.566 --> 01:32:23.479\nWe have more knowledge, I'm not ready for\nthat, I'm still emotional.\n\n1983\n01:32:23.479 --> 01:32:25.420\nI don't know if you can help me.\n\n1984\n01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.420\nCuz so far I've seen a whole\nbunch of stuff that hasn't.\n\n1985\n01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.110\nI don't see hereditary cancer anymore,\ndo I?\n\n1986\n01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:33.460\nAnd then it says, hey you can change\nthe way you look at nutrition and fitness.\n\n1987\n01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:37.590\nOkay, now, I'm really confused because\nI thought it was in the hospital.\n\n1988\n01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:40.910\nFirst, I thought it was in the hospital,\nthen I thought I was gonna get help for\n\n1989\n01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:42.010\nhereditary cancer.\n\n1990\n01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:45.760\nNow, I got a bunch of information,\nbut now, I'm talking about skin care,\n\n1991\n01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.890\nbeauty, and the food I eat.\n\n1992\n01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:52.000\nI am super confused about what these\npeople do and I do not identify.\n\n1993\n01:32:53.130 --> 01:32:57.470\nSo if I manage to go back up\nhere under Tests, Physicians,\n\n1994\n01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.530\nResources, and About, and\nI push on the tab that says Tests,\n\n1995\n01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:04.720\nwhich sounds sounds kind of medically\nthat doesn't sound real exciting.\n\n1996\n01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.960\nAnd I go through the menu and\n\n1997\n01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.079\nI find Hereditary Cancer,\nhere's where I get to, this page.\n\n1998\n01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.250\nIs there anything wrong with this page?\n\n1999\n01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:13.561\nHereditary cancer, a bunch of people.\n\n2000\n01:33:13.561 --> 01:33:15.401\nWho are they looking at?\n\n2001\n01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:16.490\nThe ground.\n\n2002\n01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.040\nWhere are they?\n\n2003\n01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.370\nI don't know maybe the woods somewhere.\n\n2004\n01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:21.130\nThey're kind of like truncated and\ncropped off.\n\n2005\n01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:22.410\nIt's nice I get it, they're living.\n\n2006\n01:33:22.410 --> 01:33:26.540\nThere's grandma, there's kids, mom and\ndad, you know we want to have longevity.\n\n2007\n01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.116\nThere's a bit of that in this picture, but\n\n2008\n01:33:29.116 --> 01:33:33.851\nis it as powerful as that woman who was\nlooking directly at you from that porch?\n\n2009\n01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:35.588\nProbably not, right?\n\n2010\n01:33:35.588 --> 01:33:40.379\nThe other thing that is really interesting\nabout this particular website is everyone\n\n2011\n01:33:40.379 --> 01:33:42.981\nin it looks to be a certain color,\ndo they not?\n\n2012\n01:33:42.981 --> 01:33:46.825\nAnd if you go to this website which I did,\nI was only able to find one or\n\n2013\n01:33:46.825 --> 01:33:49.900\ntwo people whom didn't look like this.\n\n2014\n01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.670\nThat's the problem guys.\n\n2015\n01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:54.160\nNot only is it ia problem issue for\nthis day and age, but\n\n2016\n01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.780\nit's certainly a problem for\nwhat their product is.\n\n2017\n01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:01.230\nIf you're a DNA company, you need to be\nshowing some diversity, guys, I'm sorry.\n\n2018\n01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:02.980\nThere's not a lot of diversity.\n\n2019\n01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.070\nOkay, what do I land on?\n\n2020\n01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:05.000\nAgain, I'm scared.\n\n2021\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:05.973\nI got here.\nWhat do I have?\n\n2022\n01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:09.332\nA bunch of information,\na lot of words I've gotta read.\n\n2023\n01:34:09.332 --> 01:34:10.420\nThey have all these test and\n\n2024\n01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.747\nyou guys probably can see cause\nit's in little tiny type.\n\n2025\n01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:15.300\nI can barely see it and\nI'm looking on a web screen.\n\n2026\n01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.000\nBut every single test they have has\na circle R or a TM, it's registered,\n\n2027\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.500\nit's trade marked.\n\n2028\n01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:25.390\nOkay, that's cool, I 'm grand they're\ncoming up with all this innovative test,\n\n2029\n01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:30.270\nI don't care, I just don't wanna die,\n[LAUGH] I just don't wanna die and\n\n2030\n01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:32.490\nwhen you do that, it says,\nwhat does it say?\n\n2031\n01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:33.310\nWe're communicating about us.\n\n2032\n01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:36.155\nWe came up with all these great tests,\ncircle R, circle R, TM, TM.\n\n2033\n01:34:36.155 --> 01:34:37.400\nYou don't hae to do that, guys.\n\n2034\n01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.410\nOne circle R,\none TM on your website, you're good.\n\n2035\n01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.790\nCome on.\n\n2036\n01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:42.350\nThey're just dripping in\nstuff that they've done.\n\n2037\n01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:43.990\nIt's all about them.\n\n2038\n01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.700\nWhat else do I have to do?\n\n2039\n01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.920\nI have to go through all of these tabs\nto get to the information I need.\n\n2040\n01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.590\nWell, I'm like need-to-know.\n\n2041\n01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.060\nMost cancer is known as sporadic cancer.\n\n2042\n01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.770\nI don't care,\nwhat are you gonna do for me?\n\n2043\n01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:59.910\nSolve my problem, I'm scared,\nstop telling me all this information.\n\n2044\n01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:02.760\nThen, what I do is I went to\nresults when I landed on this\n\n2045\n01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.980\npage cuz I didn't want to read\nabout cancers, I'm not ready.\n\n2046\n01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:08.059\nI went to results and\nhere's what I got for results.\n\n2047\n01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:11.600\nA big, long box of information again.\n\n2048\n01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.350\nIf you have a negative result, it means\nthat you have no clinically significant\n\n2049\n01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:19.920\nchanges associated with increased risk\nof cancer detected in the genes tested.\n\n2050\n01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.110\nAgain, Charlie Brown moment,\nwah, wah, wah, wah, right?\n\n2051\n01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:24.160\nI don't understand that.\n\n2052\n01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.850\nJust tell me I'm gonna be cool.\n\n2053\n01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:29.430\nOr say, you may wanna have a secondary\nfollow up test or you may wanna go talk,\n\n2054\n01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:31.990\ngive me language that I can relate to.\n\n2055\n01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:33.550\nIs this wrong?\n\n2056\n01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:34.586\nNo, is it bad?\n\n2057\n01:35:34.586 --> 01:35:37.352\nIt could be better,\nit could be a lot better.\n\n2058\n01:35:37.352 --> 01:35:41.460\nDid you see that we're really missing\na lie, we're missing emotional connection?\n\n2059\n01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.270\nAnd they're not connecting to my heaven or\nhell.\n\n2060\n01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:46.670\nIn my experience so far, has been painful.\n\n2061\n01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:49.102\nYou're not solving my pain.\n\n2062\n01:35:49.102 --> 01:35:52.447\nOkay, so let's go to their-\n&gt;&gt; Could we just go there?-\n\n2063\n01:35:52.447 --> 01:35:54.329\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.-\n\n2064\n01:35:54.329 --> 01:35:55.822\n&gt;&gt; Another thing on here that for\n\n2065\n01:35:55.822 --> 01:35:58.881\nme is a turn off.-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.-\n\n2066\n01:35:58.881 --> 01:36:00.168\n&gt;&gt; And.\n\n2067\n01:36:00.168 --> 01:36:04.191\nAnd, Tim,\nyou probably know what this is, but\n\n2068\n01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.528\nwhen I see, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; The live chat chick?\n\n2069\n01:36:06.528 --> 01:36:07.877\n&gt;&gt; The live chat thing.\n\n2070\n01:36:07.877 --> 01:36:10.651\nAnd the live chat thing,\nthat's not a turn off.\n\n2071\n01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:13.501\nIt's just that,\nis there only one live chat picture girl?\n\n2072\n01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:16.269\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is it always the same girl?\n\n2073\n01:36:16.269 --> 01:36:19.693\n&gt;&gt; No I'm just saying, so\nwhat that says to me is-\n\n2074\n01:36:19.693 --> 01:36:20.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n2075\n01:36:20.227 --> 01:36:22.964\n&gt;&gt; I instantly think that's a service.\n\n2076\n01:36:22.964 --> 01:36:25.257\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Not that's not the company?\n\n2077\n01:36:25.257 --> 01:36:28.282\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So now that all that mean.\n\n2078\n01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:28.816\n&gt;&gt; It's a great point.\n\n2079\n01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:33.056\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking right away,\nI'm like you couldn't even either and\n\n2080\n01:36:33.056 --> 01:36:38.215\nI wouldn't have known that, I would\nhave thought, hey I'm calling wherever.\n\n2081\n01:36:38.215 --> 01:36:39.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't\n\n2082\n01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.643\nmatter I'm calling the company or\nI gonna get a person but right away.\n\n2083\n01:36:43.643 --> 01:36:47.126\nI mean, again, we're a different group,\nbut I look at it that way.\n\n2084\n01:36:47.126 --> 01:36:50.316\nYou couldn't even go through\nthe time to change the picture, and\n\n2085\n01:36:50.316 --> 01:36:52.177\nput something that was custom to you.\n\n2086\n01:36:52.177 --> 01:36:57.158\nBut beyond that, that to me,\nthat becomes now artificial, and\n\n2087\n01:36:57.158 --> 01:37:00.745\nnot, because it's the same-\n&gt;&gt; It's not sincere.\n\n2088\n01:37:00.745 --> 01:37:02.299\n&gt;&gt; Is there only one online chat girl?\n\n2089\n01:37:02.299 --> 01:37:03.200\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n2090\n01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.483\n&gt;&gt; I'm afraid that's just an aside,\n\n2091\n01:37:04.483 --> 01:37:06.252\nthere's a product that\nwe use called Intercom.\n\n2092\n01:37:06.252 --> 01:37:07.961\nAnd each person has their\nindividual picture.\n\n2093\n01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:11.574\nWhenever someone is logged in, either at\ntheir desktop or their phone, then their\n\n2094\n01:37:11.574 --> 01:37:15.048\npicture shows up as being available, so\nyou're always there to have contact.\n\n2095\n01:37:15.048 --> 01:37:17.403\nThat's a great way to overcome\nexactly what you're talking about.\n\n2096\n01:37:17.403 --> 01:37:20.610\nThe girl with the headset is sitting\nthere with the big smile like live chat.\n\n2097\n01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:21.877\nPersonalize it.\n\n2098\n01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:22.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n2099\n01:37:22.415 --> 01:37:23.160\nWell, and I think that's fantastic.\n\n2100\n01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.271\nBut that is one thing\nthat it's the one person.\n\n2101\n01:37:27.271 --> 01:37:30.894\nBut is that, I mean does everybody\nin the world use the same girl?\n\n2102\n01:37:30.894 --> 01:37:32.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that's just her.\n\n2103\n01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.735\nBut with that being said-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n2104\n01:37:34.735 --> 01:37:37.270\n&gt;&gt; I love that because of the few times\n\n2105\n01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:42.605\nthat I've actually done that,\nwhen you can get that feeling of there's\n\n2106\n01:37:42.605 --> 01:37:47.337\nactually a person,\nit's not just a formed off, I don't care.\n\n2107\n01:37:47.337 --> 01:37:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they're making that personal part,\n\n2108\n01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:55.583\nso I've only had one time where\nyou had what you're doing,\n\n2109\n01:37:55.583 --> 01:37:58.095\nand I found that very powerful.\n\n2110\n01:37:58.095 --> 01:38:02.631\nLike there was an instant connection\nbecause it wasn't just hey,\n\n2111\n01:38:02.631 --> 01:38:05.149\nthis is Daniel, here to talk to you.\n\n2112\n01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:10.047\nWhen you have a picture with it,\nit really did make a big difference.\n\n2113\n01:38:10.047 --> 01:38:13.473\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] As well,\nIt's very awesome, very well-done,\n\n2114\n01:38:13.473 --> 01:38:17.569\nI think we owe it all to this lady here,\nI think if we paid five bucks a month\n\n2115\n01:38:17.569 --> 01:38:20.741\nmore and we can upgrade it,\n[INAUDIBLE] picture as well.\n\n2116\n01:38:20.741 --> 01:38:22.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I mean,\n\n2117\n01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.623\nno one doesn't know,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n2118\n01:38:24.623 --> 01:38:27.661\nWell that's what I mean,\nthat's my point, just for\n\n2119\n01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:29.695\nfive bucks you can put you're own.\n\n2120\n01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:32.916\n&gt;&gt; And, in the comparison to the company\nbefore, what were they saying?\n\n2121\n01:38:32.916 --> 01:38:37.319\nWe have partnered with genetic counselors,\nwe have partnered with people.\n\n2122\n01:38:37.319 --> 01:38:41.437\nI mean, they've said you're not going\nto get the CEO on the line, you get it.\n\n2123\n01:38:41.437 --> 01:38:44.614\nBut they're saying it's purpose built,\nwe've created something for you.\n\n2124\n01:38:44.614 --> 01:38:47.473\nWhere, again, this looks like a plug-in or\nsomething, right?\n\n2125\n01:38:47.473 --> 01:38:48.942\nYou don't know what kinda\ncompany you're gonna get.\n\n2126\n01:38:48.942 --> 01:38:52.206\n&gt;&gt; The extension to that is,\nI would suspect is that in terms\n\n2127\n01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:56.696\nof customer experience, when you click\non that, she's in the Philippines.\n\n2128\n01:38:56.696 --> 01:38:57.672\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n\n2129\n01:38:57.672 --> 01:39:00.759\nYou don't know if you're gonna get someone\nwho's scripted and is just going wah, wah,\n\n2130\n01:39:00.759 --> 01:39:02.899\nwah, or you're really gonna\nget someone who's like, hey,\n\n2131\n01:39:02.899 --> 01:39:04.197\nI really care about your situation.\n\n2132\n01:39:04.197 --> 01:39:07.537\n&gt;&gt; Your perception is if you\ntake care of the little things,\n\n2133\n01:39:07.537 --> 01:39:11.791\nthen what you do as your business,\nlittle things are also taken care of.\n\n2134\n01:39:11.791 --> 01:39:13.756\nBut you take care of the little\nthings on the website like that?\n\n2135\n01:39:13.756 --> 01:39:14.776\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2136\n01:39:14.776 --> 01:39:16.143\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n2137\n01:39:16.143 --> 01:39:19.578\nthat's why I like to point this out\nbecause again, a lot of times when\n\n2138\n01:39:19.578 --> 01:39:22.790\nwe get to this piece of the marketing\nit's like just get it done.\n\n2139\n01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:26.245\nAnd it just does get easy,\nyou can see how this happens, right?\n\n2140\n01:39:26.245 --> 01:39:27.023\nIt happens all the time.\n\n2141\n01:39:27.023 --> 01:39:28.762\nI can pull thousands of\nwebsites up to show you,\n\n2142\n01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.726\ncuz you're like I don't know\nhow to write that copy.\n\n2143\n01:39:30.726 --> 01:39:31.547\nI don't know what to do.\n\n2144\n01:39:31.547 --> 01:39:33.997\nYeah, but\nlive chat that'll be a nice service, and\n\n2145\n01:39:33.997 --> 01:39:37.786\nwe don't think it through strategically\nhow that's really affecting all these\n\n2146\n01:39:37.786 --> 01:39:39.921\nother things we're talking about, right?\n\n2147\n01:39:39.921 --> 01:39:42.833\nAnd so some of the things you guys were\nlike, well, how can we better measure and\n\n2148\n01:39:42.833 --> 01:39:44.544\nhow can we make our\nmarketing more effective?\n\n2149\n01:39:44.544 --> 01:39:45.686\nThis is how.\n\n2150\n01:39:45.686 --> 01:39:48.959\nBecause if you have your wife, you have\nyour foundation, if you're starting with\n\n2151\n01:39:48.959 --> 01:39:51.859\nthis foundation, then when you're\ndoing your product mix discussion,\n\n2152\n01:39:51.859 --> 01:39:54.780\nthen when you're doing your promotion\ndiscussion, what are you doing?\n\n2153\n01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.517\nYou're discussing it in relationship\nto this foundation and saying, hey,\n\n2154\n01:39:58.517 --> 01:40:00.565\nwe wanna put a live chat on your website.\n\n2155\n01:40:00.565 --> 01:40:01.424\nOkay, that's great.\n\n2156\n01:40:01.424 --> 01:40:03.635\nSounds good, yeah a live chat,\nthat'll be really good.\n\n2157\n01:40:03.635 --> 01:40:05.660\nWait a minute, I need to see that.\n\n2158\n01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.170\nHow's that gonna deliver on our why?\n\n2159\n01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:08.963\nHow's that gonna deliver\non the customer experience?\n\n2160\n01:40:08.963 --> 01:40:10.317\nHow's that gonna deliver?\n\n2161\n01:40:10.317 --> 01:40:13.265\nNow we've elevated that conversation\nbeyond just a tactic to\n\n2162\n01:40:13.265 --> 01:40:16.669\nsomething that's really gonna be\nmore meaningful, more powerful and\n\n2163\n01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:19.351\nactually make a difference for\nyour business, right?\n\n2164\n01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:20.211\nOkay.\n\n2165\n01:40:20.211 --> 01:40:21.313\nSo here's let's look it there.\n\n2166\n01:40:21.313 --> 01:40:21.927\nBut thank you, Art.\n\n2167\n01:40:21.927 --> 01:40:25.513\nI appreciate you bringing that up,\nthat was a great point.\n\n2168\n01:40:25.513 --> 01:40:26.251\nOkay, About Us.\n\n2169\n01:40:26.251 --> 01:40:29.666\nThis is the About Us page for\nthis particular company.\n\n2170\n01:40:29.666 --> 01:40:30.855\nWhat does it say?\n\n2171\n01:40:30.855 --> 01:40:35.489\nSince its founding, I love when companies\ntalk about themselves in 3rd person.\n\n2172\n01:40:35.489 --> 01:40:37.650\nSince it's founding in 2008,\nblah blah blah.\n\n2173\n01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:39.646\nWe've been known for\nour dedication, innovation.\n\n2174\n01:40:39.646 --> 01:40:42.867\nWe are a leader In healthcare industry.\n\n2175\n01:40:42.867 --> 01:40:45.894\nWe focused on providing users.\n\n2176\n01:40:45.894 --> 01:40:47.962\nBoy, now I'm a user, not a people.\n\n2177\n01:40:47.962 --> 01:40:50.406\nI'm a user, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2178\n01:40:50.406 --> 01:40:51.349\nOkay, they go on to talk but\n\n2179\n01:40:51.349 --> 01:40:54.234\nall of these are really great innovations\nthey've done which again, is amazing.\n\n2180\n01:40:54.234 --> 01:40:57.807\nAnd they're maybe a great way\nto tell us that message but\n\n2181\n01:40:57.807 --> 01:40:59.640\nnot in these words, right?\n\n2182\n01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.143\nThey believe, we also, and then this is\nokay, we believe the future of medicine.\n\n2183\n01:41:03.143 --> 01:41:04.329\nThat's great, we have a belief statement.\n\n2184\n01:41:04.329 --> 01:41:07.650\nAllows patients, not a patient,\n\n2185\n01:41:07.650 --> 01:41:12.293\nto receive affordable,\npersonalized precise care.\n\n2186\n01:41:12.293 --> 01:41:14.855\nI bet that's really\naccurate in what they do.\n\n2187\n01:41:14.855 --> 01:41:19.347\nHow many of you have ever had\na conversation and said, you know what,\n\n2188\n01:41:19.347 --> 01:41:19.893\nhoney?\n\n2189\n01:41:19.893 --> 01:41:23.836\nI'm really looking for some affordable,\npersonalized, and precise care.\n\n2190\n01:41:23.836 --> 01:41:25.997\nHave you ever had that\nconversation with your spouse?\n\n2191\n01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.873\nNo, we don't talk that way.\n\n2192\n01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:31.263\nSo when you talk at me that way,\nyou're over there and I'm over here, and\n\n2193\n01:41:31.263 --> 01:41:33.131\nnow this is just a transaction, right?\n\n2194\n01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:36.713\nAnd the funniest thing to me was\nthe word personalized [LAUGH].\n\n2195\n01:41:36.713 --> 01:41:39.402\nBecause we haven't seen\na lot of personalization,\n\n2196\n01:41:39.402 --> 01:41:42.225\nat least in this process\nthat we've seen today Right?\n\n2197\n01:41:42.225 --> 01:41:45.584\nWe haven't seen personalized in terms\nof the type of people they've shown,\n\n2198\n01:41:45.584 --> 01:41:47.094\nin the way that they're talking.\n\n2199\n01:41:47.094 --> 01:41:49.210\nThere's not a lot of\npersonalization coming out.\n\n2200\n01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:52.407\nSo that's a great example cuz\na lot of times we say what we do,\n\n2201\n01:41:52.407 --> 01:41:53.736\nwe can't say what we do.\n\n2202\n01:41:53.736 --> 01:41:56.217\nWe have to show people.\n\n2203\n01:41:56.217 --> 01:41:58.460\nBut don't say that we're quality,\nwe show quality.\n\n2204\n01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.387\nWe don't say we're the best,\nbe the best, right?\n\n2205\n01:42:01.387 --> 01:42:03.872\nWhen we start telling people\nthat's what we're gonna do,\n\n2206\n01:42:03.872 --> 01:42:05.620\nthey automatically don't believe you.\n\n2207\n01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.890\nOkay, cool.\n\n2208\n01:42:08.747 --> 01:42:09.858\nAre we good?\nLet's go on through.\n\n2209\n01:42:09.858 --> 01:42:14.297\nLet's go through to, we do have\na little bit of CX in your handout, but\n\n2210\n01:42:14.297 --> 01:42:19.363\nI wanna go ahead and move on, just for\ntime sake, and cover pillar number four.\n\n2211\n01:42:19.363 --> 01:42:22.763\nAnd then maybe we can do a little bit\nof all that together in the handout.\n\n2212\n01:42:22.763 --> 01:42:26.704\nSo I'm gonna keep talking,\nyou guys keep listening for just a second.\n\n2213\n01:42:26.704 --> 01:42:27.764\nOkay.\n\n2214\n01:42:27.764 --> 01:42:32.138\nPillar number four in our five\nunconventional pillars is we\n\n2215\n01:42:32.138 --> 01:42:37.040\nwant to go beyond being the best of\nthe best, to being the only one.\n\n2216\n01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.544\nAnd when we start looking at our business\nwith the psychonic foundation isn't that\n\n2217\n01:42:41.544 --> 01:42:43.098\nwhat you're really doing?\n\n2218\n01:42:43.098 --> 01:42:48.055\nBecause you're moving people beyond\nthat transactional decision to\n\n2219\n01:42:48.055 --> 01:42:49.993\nthat emotional decision.\n\n2220\n01:42:49.993 --> 01:42:52.525\nAnd that is why getting in touch\nwith your why is so important,\n\n2221\n01:42:52.525 --> 01:42:55.758\nbecause what's gonna separate you from\nthe pack is what makes you different.\n\n2222\n01:42:55.758 --> 01:42:57.055\nAnd it's not your product and service.\n\n2223\n01:42:57.055 --> 01:42:58.799\nI mean yeah,\nwe can have products and services.\n\n2224\n01:42:58.799 --> 01:43:01.373\nSome of us worked in really\nspecialized industries or\n\n2225\n01:43:01.373 --> 01:43:05.275\nhave specialized widgets that we make,\nbut there's always some competition.\n\n2226\n01:43:05.275 --> 01:43:07.127\nYou may have a specialized widget and\n\n2227\n01:43:07.127 --> 01:43:10.362\nsomeone else has another solution\nto a problem for that person.\n\n2228\n01:43:10.362 --> 01:43:13.412\nSo when we can start at creating\nthe psychonic foundation,\n\n2229\n01:43:13.412 --> 01:43:15.796\nnow we're separating\nourself from the pack.\n\n2230\n01:43:15.796 --> 01:43:19.115\nAnd not only are we no longer\ndragging our customers,\n\n2231\n01:43:19.115 --> 01:43:22.141\nour employees behind us and\nchasing customers,\n\n2232\n01:43:22.141 --> 01:43:26.302\nwe're also not constantly looking\nbehind us at our competition.\n\n2233\n01:43:26.302 --> 01:43:27.891\nIn Mary Kay I can tell you,\n\n2234\n01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:31.515\nI can't remember when we ever\ndid a competitive analysis.\n\n2235\n01:43:31.515 --> 01:43:34.744\nI'm sure we did some, but it just wasn't\nsomething that was top of mind for\n\n2236\n01:43:34.744 --> 01:43:38.385\nus cuz we didn't spend a lot of time when\nwe're competing with cosmetic companies or\n\n2237\n01:43:38.385 --> 01:43:40.973\nwe're competing with other\ndirect marketing companies.\n\n2238\n01:43:40.973 --> 01:43:44.708\nWe just kept serving the heck\nout of our customers.\n\n2239\n01:43:44.708 --> 01:43:47.574\nThat's all we focused on and\nas long as we did that,\n\n2240\n01:43:47.574 --> 01:43:49.988\nthe rest of it took care of itself, right?\n\n2241\n01:43:49.988 --> 01:43:53.401\nOk, so a little Jerry Garcia here,\nlove it.\n\n2242\n01:43:53.401 --> 01:43:54.459\nJerry Garcia quote,\n\n2243\n01:43:54.459 --> 01:43:57.641\nyou do not merely want to be\nconsidered just the best of the best.\n\n2244\n01:43:57.641 --> 01:44:01.924\nYou want to be considered\nthe only ones Who do what you do,\n\n2245\n01:44:01.924 --> 01:44:05.683\neven if you're working\nin a commodity business.\n\n2246\n01:44:05.683 --> 01:44:07.969\nYou're the only one who does\nit in the way you do it.\n\n2247\n01:44:07.969 --> 01:44:12.563\nYou're the only one who can deliver\non my pain point and solve me heaven.\n\n2248\n01:44:12.563 --> 01:44:14.570\nTalked about a pizza guy.\n\n2249\n01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:16.690\nIt's kind of a commodity.\nThere's a lot of pizza out there.\n\n2250\n01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:19.694\nI mean, yeah some have a little bit more\ncheese or crunchy crust and blah, blah,\n\n2251\n01:44:19.694 --> 01:44:20.413\nblah, but right?\n\n2252\n01:44:20.413 --> 01:44:23.333\nWhat's gonna get someone\nto drive that 40 miles?\n\n2253\n01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:26.137\nYou have to be separating\nyourself from the pack.\n\n2254\n01:44:26.137 --> 01:44:29.803\nOkay, so I've got this really cool cave\nstudy that's really gonna bring in all\n\n2255\n01:44:29.803 --> 01:44:31.630\nof our pillars up to this point guys.\n\n2256\n01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:34.363\nWe're gonna look at a company\nthat lost touch with its why.\n\n2257\n01:44:34.363 --> 01:44:39.265\nWe're gonna look at a company that was not\nsolving its customer's heaven and hell,\n\n2258\n01:44:39.265 --> 01:44:42.490\nand was not giving that\ncustomer experience.\n\n2259\n01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:46.029\nAnd had the potential, at one point they\nhad separated themselves from the pack.\n\n2260\n01:44:46.029 --> 01:44:50.340\nBut they were no longer doing it,\nand let's watch how they transform.\n\n2261\n01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.463\nCool, okay.\n\n2262\n01:44:52.463 --> 01:44:56.370\nWhen I came to Florida, I went to work for\na company called Dive Rite.\n\n2263\n01:44:56.370 --> 01:45:00.326\nDive Rite is a manufacturer of\ndive gear from extreme divers,\n\n2264\n01:45:00.326 --> 01:45:02.617\ncave divers is where they started.\n\n2265\n01:45:02.617 --> 01:45:04.770\nAnd when they started in 1984,\n\n2266\n01:45:04.770 --> 01:45:08.513\nthe way they started is cave\ndiving was really in its infancy.\n\n2267\n01:45:08.513 --> 01:45:12.960\nThere was like three guys who actually did\nthis here in the north Florida Springs.\n\n2268\n01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.520\nAnd one guy would say, we really\nneed to change our gear this way or\n\n2269\n01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.900\nwe need this piece of gear to continue\nto explore the underwater realm.\n\n2270\n01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.640\nSo some guy would go\nback to his garage and\n\n2271\n01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.540\nhe'd make something and you'd go,\nwhere did you get that?\n\n2272\n01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.780\nCan you make me one, and he'd make two,\nthen you'd make three and\n\n2273\n01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.980\nbefore you know it you had a business,\nright, and you're selling something.\n\n2274\n01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:33.830\nAnd when Dive Rite started they were\nkinda the only game in town, and\n\n2275\n01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:34.550\nthat was really cool.\n\n2276\n01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:38.635\nBut by 2006, when I came to the company,\nDive Rite had fallen from it's\n\n2277\n01:45:38.635 --> 01:45:41.915\nindustry leadership position\nto become a me-too brand.\n\n2278\n01:45:41.915 --> 01:45:45.181\nAnd the very first thing I did was I\nstarted interviewing their customers and\n\n2279\n01:45:45.181 --> 01:45:45.902\ntheir dealers.\n\n2280\n01:45:45.902 --> 01:45:47.486\nAnd so what is Dive Rite mean to you?\n\n2281\n01:45:47.486 --> 01:45:51.190\nAnd they're like, yeah, they're another\ndive gear, back plate's a back plate,\n\n2282\n01:45:51.190 --> 01:45:53.695\na wing's a wing, scuba tank,\nscuba tank whatever.\n\n2283\n01:45:53.695 --> 01:45:57.050\nAnd I was like, my gosh,\nthis is horrible, right?\n\n2284\n01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:00.910\nThese guys were the pioneers\nof this industry.\n\n2285\n01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:04.554\nSo, what had happened is increasing\ncompetition in the internet had allowed\n\n2286\n01:46:04.554 --> 01:46:08.376\nyou know guys in the Idaho corn fields to\nsay that they were extreme scuba divers.\n\n2287\n01:46:08.376 --> 01:46:11.555\nAnd you put the stuff up on the internet\nand you could make a few phone calls or\n\n2288\n01:46:11.555 --> 01:46:14.229\na few orders to the internet and\nyou could have some products and\n\n2289\n01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:15.663\njust drop ship it from anywhere.\n\n2290\n01:46:15.663 --> 01:46:20.260\nAnd you could say that you were\nan extreme dive game manufacturer.\n\n2291\n01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.150\nAnd new customers were coming in and\nthey were less educated.\n\n2292\n01:46:22.150 --> 01:46:25.471\nCuz what's happening is when cave\ndiving first started in it's infancy,\n\n2293\n01:46:25.471 --> 01:46:28.488\nthe only people who used cave diving\ngear were cave divers, right?\n\n2294\n01:46:28.488 --> 01:46:31.540\nBut now you have rec divers,\nwho heard about cave diving gear.\n\n2295\n01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:34.280\nWe had recreation divers who\nwere down in the islands,\n\n2296\n01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.160\nwho just wanted to look cool in black,\nright?\n\n2297\n01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.070\nYou had people who were saying, look,\nI'm never going to go in a cave, but\n\n2298\n01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:42.550\nI'm really proud of this sport,\nthe scuba diving sport, so\n\n2299\n01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:44.230\nI want really good-quality gear.\n\n2300\n01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:47.860\nSo now you have less educated customers,\nand\n\n2301\n01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.200\nthey have no idea that\nDive Right is the pioneer.\n\n2302\n01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.500\nTheir marketing was unsophisticated,\nand they had rapidly lost market share.\n\n2303\n01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.980\nThey were scared, okay?\n\n2304\n01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:59.410\nSo here's some of the serious issues.\n\n2305\n01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:00.620\nThey're losing market share,\n\n2306\n01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:03.690\nthey've lost their leadership\nperception as well as their position.\n\n2307\n01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:08.397\nCustomer service was costing\nboth reputation and money.\n\n2308\n01:47:08.397 --> 01:47:10.461\nSo here's what was happening in 2006.\n\n2309\n01:47:10.461 --> 01:47:12.730\nThey did not sell direct to the public.\n\n2310\n01:47:12.730 --> 01:47:15.720\nThey sold through dive shops,\nthrough dealer base.\n\n2311\n01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.001\nThey would have to, the dealers\nwould call in to place an order, but\n\n2312\n01:47:19.001 --> 01:47:21.950\nguess what was happening,\nwhy the phones were always busy?\n\n2313\n01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:24.570\nCustomers were calling and complaining.\n\n2314\n01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:25.919\nDealers were calling in with complaints.\n\n2315\n01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:28.399\nWell what do you want your\nsales team working on?\n\n2316\n01:47:28.399 --> 01:47:33.419\nSales, I don't want my sales team dealing\nwith complaints, that's costing me money.\n\n2317\n01:47:33.419 --> 01:47:37.490\nAlso, their customers could\nemail in through the website.\n\n2318\n01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:41.080\nBut what was happening is the sales team\nwas so busy dealing with complaints,\n\n2319\n01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.970\nthey were try to place orders and\nget those orders processed.\n\n2320\n01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:46.730\nSo these emails that were coming in with\ncomplaints were just just sitting there in\n\n2321\n01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:48.640\nthe email box for days at a time.\n\n2322\n01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.170\nHow many of our customers,\neven back in 2006,\n\n2323\n01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:52.650\nwant to wait three days when\nthey've had a product issue?\n\n2324\n01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:54.060\nThey don't.\n\n2325\n01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.180\nSo what was the customer doing?\n\n2326\n01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:57.860\nWell Facebook was around then and\nso were forums.\n\n2327\n01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:01.100\nThey were going out in forums and\nsaying this company stinks.\n\n2328\n01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.101\nThis is horrible,\n\n2329\n01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:05.615\nthey were a horrible position from\na public relation standpoint.\n\n2330\n01:48:05.615 --> 01:48:11.712\nAnd divers were an interesting bunch,\nthey're not real nice.\n\n2331\n01:48:11.712 --> 01:48:13.681\n[LAUGH] So these were not nice complaints.\n\n2332\n01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:15.930\nThey were bad complaints.\n\n2333\n01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:18.710\nAnd we'll look at some of those and\nwhat we did about them in a little bit.\n\n2334\n01:48:18.710 --> 01:48:20.705\nManagement had lost touch with their why.\n\n2335\n01:48:20.705 --> 01:48:22.715\nSo as I began sitting\nin staff meetings and\n\n2336\n01:48:22.715 --> 01:48:26.690\nconference meetings with the management,\nI was like tell me about your company.\n\n2337\n01:48:26.690 --> 01:48:29.862\nAnd they were talking just about\ntheir products and they'd say Kate,\n\n2338\n01:48:29.862 --> 01:48:32.620\ndo you know why there's 400 foot\nof line on a primary diver?\n\n2339\n01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.490\nAnd I said no.\n\n2340\n01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:35.173\nGosh, I've never really\nthought about that.\n\n2341\n01:48:35.173 --> 01:48:37.347\nThat yeah, there is 400 foot of line,\nwhy is that?\n\n2342\n01:48:37.347 --> 01:48:40.611\nAnd they said, well, that's because\nwhen we first started diving\n\n2343\n01:48:40.611 --> 01:48:43.551\nDevil's Eye in Ginnie Springs,\nwe had to tie off on the side, and\n\n2344\n01:48:43.551 --> 01:48:46.990\nthat's how much line it took us\njust to get in the entrance.\n\n2345\n01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:48.830\nAnd I'm like, that's gold.\n\n2346\n01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:49.949\nWhy are you not telling that story?\n\n2347\n01:48:49.949 --> 01:48:52.077\nYeah, but we've told that story for\n20 years.\n\n2348\n01:48:52.077 --> 01:48:54.110\nI'm like, I never heard it.\n\n2349\n01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:56.720\nI never heard it and I've been diving for\nfour or five years at that point.\n\n2350\n01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.580\nYou gotta tell that story.\n\n2351\n01:48:58.580 --> 01:48:59.140\nCuz what does that story do?\n\n2352\n01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.220\nWhat was this company's why?\n\n2353\n01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.865\nThey believe in the spirit of exploration,\nright?\n\n2354\n01:49:04.865 --> 01:49:09.114\nIt's all about exploration and\nexploring the unknown.\n\n2355\n01:49:09.114 --> 01:49:13.210\nAnd that ties in very very strongly with\ndivers because whether you are truly\n\n2356\n01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:16.666\nputting yourself in a cave that's\nnever been explored before or\n\n2357\n01:49:16.666 --> 01:49:20.830\nwhether you are just jumping into 20\nfeet water in your backyard pool.\n\n2358\n01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:21.565\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n2359\n01:49:21.565 --> 01:49:23.949\nWe don't get to be under water a lot, so\n\n2360\n01:49:23.949 --> 01:49:27.653\nyou are already in a different\nrealm if you're under water.\n\n2361\n01:49:27.653 --> 01:49:30.380\nOkay, so management had to get\nback in touch with their why.\n\n2362\n01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:31.350\nNeed to start communicating it.\n\n2363\n01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:33.257\nThey had multiple target audiences.\n\n2364\n01:49:33.257 --> 01:49:36.282\nSo, we had customers and dealers and\nwithin that we had different\n\n2365\n01:49:36.282 --> 01:49:38.740\nsophistication and\nknowledge levels, right?\n\n2366\n01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.662\nCuz we also had dealers coming\non board who were in Idaho with\n\n2367\n01:49:41.662 --> 01:49:42.781\none technical diver.\n\n2368\n01:49:42.781 --> 01:49:46.330\nAnd they were like,\nI don't know how to order this gear.\n\n2369\n01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:49.229\nWhen they first started, every one of\ntheir dealers were cave divers and\n\n2370\n01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:50.235\nthey knew how to sell it.\n\n2371\n01:49:50.235 --> 01:49:53.117\nNow, you had dealers who didn't\nknow how to sell this gear and\n\n2372\n01:49:53.117 --> 01:49:55.565\nit was creating a problem\nwith really small orders.\n\n2373\n01:49:55.565 --> 01:49:58.130\nDealers were less experienced\nin placing small orders.\n\n2374\n01:49:58.130 --> 01:50:00.320\nAnd then, without new products,\nthe growth was stagnant.\n\n2375\n01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.540\nThe way this company owner was growing\nhis company was through new products and\n\n2376\n01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:04.770\nnew categories.\n\n2377\n01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:06.740\nSo first, they had lights and\nthen they had backlights.\n\n2378\n01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.100\nAnd then, they had wings in there and\nwhatever.\n\n2379\n01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.993\nAnd kept adding more categories which,\nof course,\n\n2380\n01:50:09.993 --> 01:50:11.980\ngrew the company because they\nhad more things to sell.\n\n2381\n01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.273\nWell by the time I got there, he's like\nI don't have anything else to sell.\n\n2382\n01:50:14.273 --> 01:50:15.560\nWe got everything.\n\n2383\n01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.880\nI don't know what else\nto sell these people.\n\n2384\n01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.280\nI said, we gotta get back\nto that foundation, right?\n\n2385\n01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.780\nRemember when I first started today,\nwe talked about product mix.\n\n2386\n01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:26.420\nWe're always looking for\nnew channels or new products.\n\n2387\n01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.430\nWhen we do that, eventually,\nyou reach the end of the line sometimes.\n\n2388\n01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:31.167\nHe reached the end of the line, so\n\n2389\n01:50:31.167 --> 01:50:34.220\nwe had to go back to that\nfoundation that wasn't in place.\n\n2390\n01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:37.172\nAll right, so here's what we did.\n\n2391\n01:50:37.172 --> 01:50:39.609\nFirst of all, we started with why.\n\n2392\n01:50:39.609 --> 01:50:43.774\nSo it's kind of tiny, but in the\nbackground here there's sort of a white\n\n2393\n01:50:43.774 --> 01:50:48.040\nbox behind this more colorful one\nin front and it says primary reel.\n\n2394\n01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:49.400\nAnd if you were in their website,\n\n2395\n01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:52.666\nwhat you would see is a description of\nthis primary reel I was telling you about.\n\n2396\n01:50:52.666 --> 01:50:57.131\nAnd it starts with the Genesis of the\nprimary reel started at Jenny Springs in\n\n2397\n01:50:57.131 --> 01:50:58.468\nNorth Florida caves.\n\n2398\n01:50:58.468 --> 01:51:00.328\nThe reason it has 400 foot of line,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n2399\n01:51:00.328 --> 01:51:03.300\nIt's kinda copy heavy,\nthere's a lot of copy there, right?\n\n2400\n01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:06.351\nBut in this instance it's okay,\nbecause what do divers like to do,\n\n2401\n01:51:06.351 --> 01:51:07.590\nwhat do runners like to do?\n\n2402\n01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:10.651\nThey don't wanna talk about shoes,\nwhat do they wanna talk about?\n\n2403\n01:51:10.651 --> 01:51:12.447\n&gt;&gt; Talk about the race or the cave.\n\n2404\n01:51:12.447 --> 01:51:13.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n2405\n01:51:13.264 --> 01:51:17.840\nYou wanna tell stories\n&gt;&gt; So this storytelling aspect worked out\n\n2406\n01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.940\nreally well for this audience, because\nthey didn't just want a reel, they wanted\n\n2407\n01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:23.500\nto know where it came from, and how to\nuse it, and what they could do with it.\n\n2408\n01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:27.101\nThen there was a couple tabs, they could\ngo into techs facts and they could learn\n\n2409\n01:51:27.101 --> 01:51:30.326\nwhat it was made of, because some\ndivers are all about the equipment and\n\n2410\n01:51:30.326 --> 01:51:33.387\nhow is it made, and is it gonna rust,\nis it marine grade stainless,\n\n2411\n01:51:33.387 --> 01:51:36.451\nwhere is that stainless from,\nthat's cool we told them all that And\n\n2412\n01:51:36.451 --> 01:51:39.694\nother people just wanted the story\ntelling him to know that it worked.\n\n2413\n01:51:39.694 --> 01:51:42.260\nAnd then we gave him some\ntips on how to make it work.\n\n2414\n01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.914\nSo again, we could have just said here's\nyour dive reel, hope your instructor\n\n2415\n01:51:45.914 --> 01:51:49.970\nshowed you how to use it cuz we're not\na training agency, we're a manufacturer.\n\n2416\n01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:51.305\nWe didn't, we gave him tips.\n\n2417\n01:51:51.305 --> 01:51:54.833\nHere's something you can do, you wanna do\nthis, here's how to make it last longer,\n\n2418\n01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:57.773\nhere's how to make it work better,\nhere's how not to have it bungle for\n\n2419\n01:51:57.773 --> 01:51:59.194\nyou under water, blah blah blah.\n\n2420\n01:51:59.194 --> 01:52:02.442\nOkay, so, this product description\nhad this historical text.\n\n2421\n01:52:02.442 --> 01:52:05.205\nThe other thing that you see here\nis like a little bitty TV set,\n\n2422\n01:52:05.205 --> 01:52:07.860\ndo you see that on that bottom picture?\n\n2423\n01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:13.764\nThat TV set was actually a video channel,\na direct TV channel that we created.\n\n2424\n01:52:13.764 --> 01:52:15.920\nAnd here's where that came from.\n\n2425\n01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.890\nThe company founder and\nI, we would go diving.\n\n2426\n01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:20.840\nWhenever I had time,\nI would go to the water with him.\n\n2427\n01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.500\nHe would run around to all\nthe different divers and\n\n2428\n01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.080\ngo you need to adjust this here.\n\n2429\n01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:24.920\nHere, take my light.\n\n2430\n01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:25.650\nYou don't want that one.\n\n2431\n01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:27.147\nThat's not gonna be bright enough.\n\n2432\n01:52:27.147 --> 01:52:28.580\nHere, you need to adjust this.\n\n2433\n01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:29.750\nAnd he started going around and\n\n2434\n01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:32.500\nhe would always be working\nwith all the different divers.\n\n2435\n01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:34.740\nIt didn't matter if they\nhad his gear on or not.\n\n2436\n01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.550\nHelping them have a better experience.\n\n2437\n01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:40.140\nAnd no one could do it better than\nthe guy who created this stuff to begin\n\n2438\n01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.150\nwith right?\n\n2439\n01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:44.131\nWho's been diving in caves for\n20, 30 years at that point.\n\n2440\n01:52:44.131 --> 01:52:48.030\nAnd by the time these people would come\nback out of the water after he fixed it.\n\n2441\n01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.795\nHe'd be like, my gosh.\n\n2442\n01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:49.411\nThey were like fans.\n\n2443\n01:52:49.411 --> 01:52:51.507\nAnd he would literally\nbe like selling my gear.\n\n2444\n01:52:51.507 --> 01:52:55.322\nHere take Kate's back plate,\ntake her dry suit and I'd be like, hey!\n\n2445\n01:52:55.322 --> 01:52:56.650\nYou know?\n\n2446\n01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:59.840\nAnd we would literally sell things\nright out of the back of his truck.\n\n2447\n01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.520\nAnd I'm like, that's pretty powerful,\nhow do I do that?\n\n2448\n01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.744\nRemember how I wanted to bottle Mary Kay?\n\n2449\n01:53:03.744 --> 01:53:05.720\nI wanted to bottle this guy.\n\n2450\n01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.910\nSo the way we bottled\nhim is through video.\n\n2451\n01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:09.590\nIt wasn't some big production.\n\n2452\n01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:10.890\nWe just got out a video camera and\n\n2453\n01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:13.550\nstarted video taping him\ntalking about the product.\n\n2454\n01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:16.728\nAnd every time we launched a new product,\nor every time we got a customer service\n\n2455\n01:53:16.728 --> 01:53:20.201\nissue that asked a question, we're like,\nthey're not the only person asking this.\n\n2456\n01:53:20.201 --> 01:53:23.102\nSo let's video tape this guy and\nwho better to do it than\n\n2457\n01:53:23.102 --> 01:53:26.840\nthe guy who actually creates it and\nhas the authority to talk about it.\n\n2458\n01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.729\nAnd then eventually,\n\n2459\n01:53:27.729 --> 01:53:31.310\nsome of the employees we started doing\nvideos too because we're all cave divers.\n\n2460\n01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:33.600\nAnd I was great because I\nwas able to talk to women.\n\n2461\n01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:36.421\nBecause women are like Kate, how do you\ncarry 88 to 90 pounds on your back?\n\n2462\n01:53:36.421 --> 01:53:37.382\nAnd I'm like well let me tell you, right?\n\n2463\n01:53:37.382 --> 01:53:41.541\nIt's gonna be a lot more authentic coming\nfrom me than a guy who's 6' 2\" and\n\n2464\n01:53:41.541 --> 01:53:42.460\nweighs 240.\n\n2465\n01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:45.690\nSo we started creating this channel\nwhere people could come to which did\n\n2466\n01:53:45.690 --> 01:53:46.860\nwhat for us?\n\n2467\n01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:50.140\nRaised our authority, created the fact\nthat we were the only game in town\n\n2468\n01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.480\nbecause no one else could touch this.\n\n2469\n01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.110\nThe guy in Idaho couldn't say that, right?\n\n2470\n01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:57.318\nNor are they willing to invest\nin the technology to say it.\n\n2471\n01:53:57.318 --> 01:54:01.260\nSo this was a beautiful way to\ncreate a virtual company founder.\n\n2472\n01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.560\nWe also took that story-telling\ninto their catalog,\n\n2473\n01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:06.930\ntheir trade shows,\nanything that was off-line, like in print.\n\n2474\n01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:10.870\nAnd what was really genius that we didn't\nreally expect, but that catalog that\n\n2475\n01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:16.780\ncosts you a million dollars to print, we\nput the stories on the inside in the fold.\n\n2476\n01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:19.570\nAnd what happened,\npeople were getting in fist fights for\n\n2477\n01:54:19.570 --> 01:54:23.030\nthese catalogs because they had\nthese amazing, genuine stories.\n\n2478\n01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:24.900\nThese became coffee table books.\n\n2479\n01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.823\nThink about your catalog.\n\n2480\n01:54:25.823 --> 01:54:28.100\nYou just want someone to take\nan order form and buy stuff.\n\n2481\n01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:29.710\nThey were keeping them for years.\n\n2482\n01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:31.180\nAnd every time of course\nwe'd publish a new one,\n\n2483\n01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.340\npeople would want the new\none as a collector's item.\n\n2484\n01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.268\nWe put them in the orders for the dealers,\nwhat were the dealers able to do?\n\n2485\n01:54:36.268 --> 01:54:40.190\nNow I'm an inexperienced dealer out\nin the middle of Idaho, whatever,\n\n2486\n01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:43.724\nthat catalogue comes in my order,\nI can give it to my employees and\n\n2487\n01:54:43.724 --> 01:54:47.130\nthey can have better education\nto sell this product.\n\n2488\n01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:49.906\nOr they can go to the internet, to this\nchannel that they've created and say,\n\n2489\n01:54:49.906 --> 01:54:52.598\nyou know I don't know the answer to\nyour problem, but let's go over here and\n\n2490\n01:54:52.598 --> 01:54:53.207\nask Dive Right.\n\n2491\n01:54:53.207 --> 01:54:56.980\nAnd here's the company founder, or Kate,\nor whoever, answering your question.\n\n2492\n01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:01.613\nOkay, and in with, I say high\ncaliber product use content, again,\n\n2493\n01:55:01.613 --> 01:55:04.805\nit's not just about the product,\nit's not just about [SOUND],\n\n2494\n01:55:04.805 --> 01:55:09.168\nhere's our product, it's made of marine\ngrade stainless, it was how do you use it?\n\n2495\n01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:13.150\nAnd how do you use it to solve these\nvery specific problems you're having?\n\n2496\n01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:16.540\nAnd then finally, we did new branding.\n\n2497\n01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:20.229\nAbove those words the primary rail you'll\nsee this very tiny red and white logo,\n\n2498\n01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:23.000\nI don't know if you guys can see that far.\n\n2499\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.700\nThat was a dive flag logo that had been\ntheir logo for a really long time.\n\n2500\n01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.560\nWell if you are a diver, what a dive\nflag is used for is people on boats.\n\n2501\n01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.460\nYou have to have a dive flag on you boat\nbecause when you have divers in the water\n\n2502\n01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:37.760\nyou don't want other boats to come over\nthat area, so the divers don't surface and\n\n2503\n01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.700\nyour boat's going over them.\n\n2504\n01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.793\nSo the dive flag with the cave\nwas a real disconnect.\n\n2505\n01:55:41.793 --> 01:55:45.489\nCave divers don't need that,\nwe're in a cave, we're not gonna surface,\n\n2506\n01:55:45.489 --> 01:55:47.520\nthere's no boats in a cave.\n\n2507\n01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.610\nSo the dive flag really said recreational\ndiving, it didn't say cave diving.\n\n2508\n01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:55.670\nBut we also didn't wanna completely\njust tear away their identity with\n\n2509\n01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:56.510\nsomething brand new.\n\n2510\n01:55:56.510 --> 01:56:01.680\nSo what we came up with was this dive\nflag that has this yellow line arrow.\n\n2511\n01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.040\nAnd a line arrow is what a cave diver\nuses in the cave to mark the line so\n\n2512\n01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.560\nyou find your way back out if there's\na silt out or some sort of accident.\n\n2513\n01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.610\nSo people knew that this was a really\nclever way to say, yeah we're divers,\n\n2514\n01:56:14.610 --> 01:56:17.080\nbecause everybody gets the dive flag,\nthat is ubiquitous.\n\n2515\n01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.660\nIt's a ubiquitous sign for divers,\nbut we're a cave diving company.\n\n2516\n01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.000\nOr what we did is then we matched that\nwith the tagline that said equipment for\n\n2517\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.290\nserious divers, not equipment for\ncave divers, equipment for serious divers,\n\n2518\n01:56:29.290 --> 01:56:33.090\ncuz I might be a recreational diver who's\nreally serious about my dive, right?\n\n2519\n01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:34.910\nAnd now I belong,\n\n2520\n01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:38.150\nI'm no longer scared of you because if you\nwere a cave diver I may be scared of you.\n\n2521\n01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:40.672\nSo see how we're creating\nbelonging in this execution?\n\n2522\n01:56:40.672 --> 01:56:42.760\nI'm solving people's problems.\n\n2523\n01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.280\nI'm creating an experience\nthat is really seamless,\n\n2524\n01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.130\nwhich you're gonna see in a minute,\nand I'm really starting with my why.\n\n2525\n01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:52.660\nOkay, so how do we solve hell and\nserve heaven?\n\n2526\n01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:56.460\nWell first of all, we had to do this for\nboth dealers and customers remember.\n\n2527\n01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:00.100\nSo customer service response\ntime is where we began.\n\n2528\n01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:02.630\nFirst of all, everyone had to\nhave an immediate response.\n\n2529\n01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:05.821\nWe could no longer allow people to\nsit there in the in-mail box for\n\n2530\n01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:06.585\ndays at a time.\n\n2531\n01:57:06.585 --> 01:57:10.200\nAnd we also changed how we responded.\n\n2532\n01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.570\nSo one of the things that we did is we\nhad what we called a solution finder.\n\n2533\n01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:17.220\nSo not only could you go and\nwatch these videos about the products and\n\n2534\n01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:22.210\nthe tips, but in this little slide behind\nwith that blue bar is a solution finder,\n\n2535\n01:57:22.210 --> 01:57:23.960\nand what it is it had a drop down menu,\n\n2536\n01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.220\nit said what problem are you having or\nwhat question do you have?\n\n2537\n01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.240\nWell, I have a question about buoyancy.\n\n2538\n01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.020\nOkay.\n\n2539\n01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.284\nWell, do you dive in cold water or\nwarm water?\n\n2540\n01:57:33.284 --> 01:57:35.210\nAnd they could self select.\n\n2541\n01:57:35.210 --> 01:57:36.900\nDo you drive a dry suit or a wet suit?\n\n2542\n01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:39.260\nThey would self select the drop down menu.\n\n2543\n01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:43.670\nDo you dive with one,\na single tank or double tanks?\n\n2544\n01:57:43.670 --> 01:57:45.381\nAnd by the time they got through this,\n\n2545\n01:57:45.381 --> 01:57:49.190\nwe were able to serve up a more customized\nanswer versus what would you normally see?\n\n2546\n01:57:49.190 --> 01:57:51.666\nA thousand FAQs that I've\ngotta sort through, right?\n\n2547\n01:57:51.666 --> 01:57:53.510\nI don't want that.\n\n2548\n01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:54.950\nI want you to talk to me.\n\n2549\n01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:57.900\nI'm a single tank diver in warm water and\nI wear a wetsuit.\n\n2550\n01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.550\nBoom, you're having\nan issue with buoyancy.\n\n2551\n01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:00.830\nHere's your answer.\n\n2552\n01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:02.390\nThe answer was never self serving.\n\n2553\n01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:04.370\nWe always had a product\nsuggestion in there.\n\n2554\n01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:05.810\nHave you tried this, have you tried this?\n\n2555\n01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:07.470\nSee and there might have been a product.\n\n2556\n01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:11.380\nBut we also gave them tips and we also\ngave them just general advice because\n\n2557\n01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:13.880\nwe're all divers and we get the problem.\n\n2558\n01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:18.510\nAnd that did more than anything\nto really help people go,\n\n2559\n01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:20.090\nmy gosh this company cares about me.\n\n2560\n01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:25.050\nWithin seven months of launching this\nwebsite and having that solution finder,\n\n2561\n01:58:25.050 --> 01:58:28.150\nremember all those forums that I told you\nabout where people were lambasting us?\n\n2562\n01:58:28.150 --> 01:58:30.970\nPeople were actually\nsending the complainers,\n\n2563\n01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:34.078\nlike we had fans who were now all\nof a sudden service liaisons.\n\n2564\n01:58:34.078 --> 01:58:35.590\nDid you not use their solutions finder?\n\n2565\n01:58:35.590 --> 01:58:37.193\nThey've already covered that,\ndon't bother them.\n\n2566\n01:58:37.193 --> 01:58:40.140\nAnd we were like,\nthis is the coolest thing ever!\n\n2567\n01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.240\nRight, and\nwhat was happening on the phones?\n\n2568\n01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.420\nWas our sales guys having to talk\nto all these people on the phone?\n\n2569\n01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.430\nNo.\nWhat happens to the phone calls?\n\n2570\n01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:47.350\nThey're going down.\n\n2571\n01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:49.210\nSo what happens to our phone call quality?\n\n2572\n01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:50.360\nIt's a sale.\n\n2573\n01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.852\nWhat happens to the dealer?\n\n2574\n01:58:51.852 --> 01:58:53.839\nI'm not really sure if I should\nget that in my order or not.\n\n2575\n01:58:53.839 --> 01:58:54.560\nI don't know how to use it.\n\n2576\n01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.630\nWell that's cool, just send your\ncustomer to the solution finder.\n\n2577\n01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:58.486\nJust send your customer to the TV channel.\n\n2578\n01:58:58.486 --> 01:59:00.400\nDo you see what we're doing?\n\n2579\n01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:04.100\nSo we're really creating this\nexperience that's helping everyone.\n\n2580\n01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:06.044\nSo, the other thing we did\nis we changed the tone.\n\n2581\n01:59:06.044 --> 01:59:08.595\nOne of the things I see all\nthe time on your Google reviews,\n\n2582\n01:59:08.595 --> 01:59:10.380\nyour Facebook reviews, and blah blah.\n\n2583\n01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:13.277\nPeople try to explain as\nthe company owner what happened.\n\n2584\n01:59:13.277 --> 01:59:15.560\nWe don't wanna explain.\n\n2585\n01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.416\nNobody wants an explanation,\nwe don't need an explanation.\n\n2586\n01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:19.288\nI want you to listen,\nI want you to validate and\n\n2587\n01:59:19.288 --> 01:59:20.710\nI want you to solve my problem.\n\n2588\n01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:21.680\nThat's all I want.\n\n2589\n01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:24.971\nDo not tell me about all the back office\nstuff that you had to go through.\n\n2590\n01:59:24.971 --> 01:59:28.720\nSo, that's what Dive Right had been doing\nand that's what I see a lot of times.\n\n2591\n01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:29.589\nSo, listen and validate.\n\n2592\n01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:31.750\nSo here is the perfect example.\n\n2593\n01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:33.476\nWe had a guy write in to us and\n\n2594\n01:59:33.476 --> 01:59:37.845\nhe said you almost killed me on\na 300 foot ocean dive last weekend.\n\n2595\n01:59:37.845 --> 01:59:41.552\nThat's pretty serious customer complaint,\nright?\n\n2596\n01:59:43.025 --> 01:59:46.980\nYour reel fouled underwater, and\nit almost missed my decompression.\n\n2597\n01:59:48.170 --> 01:59:50.210\nWhoa, okay, that's a big deal.\n\n2598\n01:59:50.210 --> 01:59:53.324\nThat's not one you let sit in the inbox,\nokay.\n\n2599\n01:59:53.324 --> 01:59:58.200\nSo my response to him was, wow,\nthat must have been really scary.\n\n2600\n01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.309\nRight, wouldn't that be scary?\n\n2601\n02:00:00.309 --> 02:00:03.184\nI'm just validating, I'm not saying\nit's my fault or his fault or anybody.\n\n2602\n02:00:03.184 --> 02:00:05.080\nI'm just validating,\nthat must have been scary.\n\n2603\n02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.160\nI get it man, I'm a diver,\nstuff happens it's scary.\n\n2604\n02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.580\nI said wow,\nthat must have been really scary.\n\n2605\n02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:12.010\nYou know what could happen?\n\n2606\n02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:17.002\nIf you're a salt water diver,\nsometimes if the gear isn't rinsed or salt\n\n2607\n02:00:17.002 --> 02:00:22.397\nstarts to build up, it can build up under\nthat little clip that's on the outside\n\n2608\n02:00:22.397 --> 02:00:27.489\nof the spool that's actually holding\nit to the axle and that clip will pop.\n\n2609\n02:00:27.489 --> 02:00:29.680\nCould have been salt crystals.\n\n2610\n02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.307\nIt's all I'm doing.\n\n2611\n02:00:30.307 --> 02:00:31.980\nI'm not telling them whose fault it is.\n\n2612\n02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:34.050\nI'm explaining just a little piece.\n\n2613\n02:00:34.050 --> 02:00:36.970\nAnd the reason I did that\nis what is his true pain?\n\n2614\n02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:39.850\nIs his true pain that he's\nscared that he almost died?\n\n2615\n02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:43.731\nNo, his true pain is because he's\na big buff technical diver, and\n\n2616\n02:00:43.731 --> 02:00:46.797\nhe was on a boat and\nhe paid a lot of money for his dive.\n\n2617\n02:00:46.797 --> 02:00:51.189\nAnd he's with all his buddies and he was\nthe dude that had to come up early and\n\n2618\n02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:53.370\nalmost spoiled everybody's dive.\n\n2619\n02:00:53.370 --> 02:00:55.190\nI gave him a story to tell.\n\n2620\n02:00:55.190 --> 02:00:56.557\nWasn't my fault dudes!\n\n2621\n02:00:56.557 --> 02:00:57.840\nIt was a salt crystal.\n\n2622\n02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.325\nIt was a salt crystal, we just all\nhave to start rinsing our gear better.\n\n2623\n02:01:00.325 --> 02:01:01.650\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n\n2624\n02:01:01.650 --> 02:01:04.170\nAnd you know what, I'm sending you a reel.\n\n2625\n02:01:04.170 --> 02:01:05.165\nGive me your address.\n\n2626\n02:01:05.165 --> 02:01:06.295\nCuz what's the other thing he's mad about?\n\n2627\n02:01:06.295 --> 02:01:08.560\nMaybe the other reel is on\nthe bottom of the ocean.\n\n2628\n02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.270\nThat's all he needed.\n\n2629\n02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:11.730\nThat's all he needed.\n\n2630\n02:01:11.730 --> 02:01:12.620\nAnd you start doing that for\n\n2631\n02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:15.690\nyour customers,\nhe turned into an advocate for us.\n\n2632\n02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:17.760\nWe couldn't get him off\nthe Internet talking about us.\n\n2633\n02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:18.467\nThat's all we did.\n\n2634\n02:01:18.467 --> 02:01:21.100\nOne minute we were trying to kill him,\nthe next minute we were his best friend.\n\n2635\n02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:22.320\nDo you see how that is?\n\n2636\n02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.400\nBut it's all the time.\n\n2637\n02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.160\nSo we changed that tone throughout\nall of our customer service,\n\n2638\n02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.380\nwhether we're answering on the forums or\nFacebook or wherever.\n\n2639\n02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:29.660\nThat was the tone.\n\n2640\n02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:33.521\nWe validate, we help them with whatever\ntheir problem is and that was it,\n\n2641\n02:01:33.521 --> 02:01:34.222\nwe're out.\n\n2642\n02:01:34.222 --> 02:01:36.670\nAnd the other thing I put on\nhere is never say unfortunately.\n\n2643\n02:01:36.670 --> 02:01:38.930\nJust have to put that,\nit's a really small detail, but\n\n2644\n02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:42.570\nit's huge because unfortunately,\nwe're closed on Friday.\n\n2645\n02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:44.320\nUnfortunately we don't have blue.\n\n2646\n02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:45.897\nUnfortunately, we're\nout of that right now.\n\n2647\n02:01:45.897 --> 02:01:50.200\nYou'll never well, cuz you're not,\nnow I'm unfortunate,\n\n2648\n02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:51.510\nyou're telling them you're unfortunate.\n\n2649\n02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:52.500\nYou're unfortunate.\n\n2650\n02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:54.900\nYeah unfortunately, she's out at lunch and\n\n2651\n02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:56.700\nyou're not gonna be able\nto talk to her right now.\n\n2652\n02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.710\nNo, no, no.\nHey, you know what, Sue's out at lunch but\n\n2653\n02:01:59.710 --> 02:02:04.140\nI could help you for a few minutes,\nand get the initial paperwork going or\n\n2654\n02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:07.250\nyou're welcome to come back or\nI could actually have Sue call you.\n\n2655\n02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:08.300\nWhat would be your preference?\n\n2656\n02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:09.600\nSee what I'm saying?\n\n2657\n02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:12.280\nVersus like unfortunately Sue's out\nto lunch, what do you wanna do?\n\n2658\n02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:13.880\nRight, so anyways.\n\n2659\n02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.734\nOkay, we wanna preemptively solve\nproblems through education.\n\n2660\n02:02:16.734 --> 02:02:18.920\nAnd that's what I was doing\nwith that guy with that reel.\n\n2661\n02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.130\nWe had this online solution finder,\nand we had to the video tutorials.\n\n2662\n02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:24.302\nSo the other thing that was\nreally great about this guy,\n\n2663\n02:02:24.302 --> 02:02:26.710\nis if I am diving in Thailand and\nI have a problem and\n\n2664\n02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:29.780\nI am getting ready to go on this really\nserious dive, I don't wanna wait for\n\n2665\n02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:34.030\nthis company in the states to\nopen to call them or email them.\n\n2666\n02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:36.529\nSo now I can do it through this\ninteractive solution finder or\n\n2667\n02:02:36.529 --> 02:02:39.526\nthrough these videos,\nautomatically for myself, that's 24/7.\n\n2668\n02:02:39.526 --> 02:02:44.465\nAnd we talk about customer experience, the\nnumber one piece of customer service, or\n\n2669\n02:02:44.465 --> 02:02:49.540\ncustomer experience right now that's\nmeasurable for your bottom line is access.\n\n2670\n02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:52.570\nPeople want timely access to you.\n\n2671\n02:02:52.570 --> 02:02:54.580\nIf you can get somebody 24/7, do it.\n\n2672\n02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:57.960\nIf you can change your business\nmodel to be 24/7, do it.\n\n2673\n02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:01.560\nBecause people do not wanna wait for\nyou to open, they wanna know they can get\n\n2674\n02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:04.106\ntheir question answered now,\nwithin five minutes.\n\n2675\n02:03:04.106 --> 02:03:05.551\nSo when we start talking\nabout millennials,\n\n2676\n02:03:05.551 --> 02:03:07.150\nthat's a millennial thing right there.\n\n2677\n02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:09.570\nTell me now, I'm not gonna wait,\nI'm not gonna wait.\n\n2678\n02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:11.860\nGive me the response I need or\nI've already moved on.\n\n2679\n02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:14.250\nListen and interact.\n\n2680\n02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:16.310\nOnline forums and social media.\n\n2681\n02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:17.750\nSocial media is social.\n\n2682\n02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.910\nWhat is social?\n\n2683\n02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:21.450\nIt's a two way street.\n\n2684\n02:03:21.450 --> 02:03:25.339\nSo I have to not only post things that\nyou're interested in or relevant to you,\n\n2685\n02:03:25.339 --> 02:03:27.840\nI have to talk to you when you push like.\n\n2686\n02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.390\nWhen you leave a comment,\nI need to say, great, I'm so\n\n2687\n02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:32.270\nglad this was helpful for you.\n\n2688\n02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:34.680\nAre you coming to the party on Friday?\n\n2689\n02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.370\nYes, I've RSVPed on Facebook.\n\n2690\n02:03:36.370 --> 02:03:39.170\nAwesome, we can't wait to see you,\nto each and every person.\n\n2691\n02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:41.440\nSocial media is a two-way street and\nDiveRite wasn't doing that.\n\n2692\n02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.234\nThey were using it as a billboard for\ntheir announcements.\n\n2693\n02:03:45.405 --> 02:03:47.475\nWe were,\nanytime a new product was launching,\n\n2694\n02:03:47.475 --> 02:03:50.595\nyou betcha we were on social media or\nthe forums posting that.\n\n2695\n02:03:50.595 --> 02:03:51.545\nAnd then what happens?\n\n2696\n02:03:51.545 --> 02:03:54.805\nWe would retreat for months at a time\nuntil the new product launched, or\n\n2697\n02:03:54.805 --> 02:03:57.340\nyou had a new price reduction or a sale.\n\n2698\n02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:58.250\nWe can't do that guys.\n\n2699\n02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:00.980\nThat's not genuine,\nthat's not authentic, it's social media.\n\n2700\n02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:04.132\nSo we started listening, we started\ninteracting, we did it on a daily basis\n\n2701\n02:04:04.132 --> 02:04:06.992\nand we distributed that responsibility\nthroughout the company, so\n\n2702\n02:04:06.992 --> 02:04:08.294\nwe didn't have a bottleneck.\n\n2703\n02:04:08.294 --> 02:04:10.953\nAnd you, you, you, you,\nyou could all respond to these\n\n2704\n02:04:10.953 --> 02:04:14.110\npeople whatever hour of\nthe day you're assigned to.\n\n2705\n02:04:14.110 --> 02:04:15.420\nAnd you knew what the tone was, and\n\n2706\n02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:19.550\nyou knew how to respond because we had\nthat strategy and that process in place.\n\n2707\n02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:23.530\nSo now what happens is, you're always on\nand that's what your customers want and\n\n2708\n02:04:23.530 --> 02:04:25.770\nyou're being genuine and authentic and\ngiving them what they need.\n\n2709\n02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.380\nOkay, the other piece we did is\nwe did a customer newsletter,\n\n2710\n02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:32.265\nthis is back when newsletters were\npopular, down to newsletters.\n\n2711\n02:04:32.265 --> 02:04:34.575\nThis was in 2007,\nnow they are not popular.\n\n2712\n02:04:34.575 --> 02:04:38.125\nBut we did do newsletters to our customers\nonce a month, they had a dive story,\n\n2713\n02:04:38.125 --> 02:04:41.495\nusually it was featuring them, they\ncould write in and tell us their story.\n\n2714\n02:04:41.495 --> 02:04:45.175\nWe might feature a product, again with\nsome product use or some tips and\n\n2715\n02:04:45.175 --> 02:04:46.225\npeople loved that.\n\n2716\n02:04:46.225 --> 02:04:47.579\nBrought them closer into the brand.\n\n2717\n02:04:47.579 --> 02:04:50.870\nNobody else was taking the time\nto do that for their customers.\n\n2718\n02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:54.990\nAnd then we took it offline, although that\nlogo is up there, the DiveRite Tech Tour,\n\n2719\n02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:57.950\nis we took that experience we\nhad with the company founder.\n\n2720\n02:04:57.950 --> 02:05:01.630\nWell they had regional sales development\nguys who were already out in\n\n2721\n02:05:01.630 --> 02:05:05.860\nthe various territories who were diving\nwith dealers, and going to dealers\n\n2722\n02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:08.960\nbecause we said let's just get in the\nwater with them, let's just open that up.\n\n2723\n02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:12.328\nThe dealer is gonna make more money, he's\nhappy, his staff's gonna learn because\n\n2724\n02:05:12.328 --> 02:05:15.601\nyou're gonna be there doing this tech\ntour, and then a whole bunch of customers,\n\n2725\n02:05:15.601 --> 02:05:18.465\nwe made these big events out of them,\ncould come and try before you buy.\n\n2726\n02:05:18.465 --> 02:05:21.411\nAnd it was hugely successful,\nbecause dive gear's really expensive and\n\n2727\n02:05:21.411 --> 02:05:24.270\nif I'm gonna buy that,\nI want to make sure it works for me.\n\n2728\n02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:26.460\nAnd the dealers were really ecstatic\nbecause we were helping them\n\n2729\n02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:27.280\ngrow their business, right.\n\n2730\n02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:30.966\nSo we were supporting our dealers and\ndriving that sales in through their door.\n\n2731\n02:05:30.966 --> 02:05:35.180\nAll right, solving heaven,\nsolving hell, serving heaven.\n\n2732\n02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:39.280\nLet's go on and I've already covered a lot\nof this, but in that customer experience,\n\n2733\n02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:45.320\nso we have this 24/7 interactive,\nbeing a keyword there, customer service.\n\n2734\n02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.700\nDon't just send me the FAQ's.\n\n2735\n02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:51.260\nWe had a 24 hour customer service\nresponse time, so if you did email us,\n\n2736\n02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:55.309\nwe had a commitment that was in writing,\nwe would get back to you within 24 hours.\n\n2737\n02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.350\nWe had a 72 hour shipping time.\n\n2738\n02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:02.090\nSo one of the big things that was\nkilling them is that they were used\n\n2739\n02:06:02.090 --> 02:06:06.150\nto dealers making these really big orders,\nand they would ship large inventory,\n\n2740\n02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:07.760\nand it'd take three weeks to pack.\n\n2741\n02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.450\nWell now you have all these little\ndealers who are doing onesies and\n\n2742\n02:06:10.450 --> 02:06:13.300\ntwosies, $100 order, $500, $1000 order.\n\n2743\n02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.635\nThey want that quick because\ntheir customer wants it quick.\n\n2744\n02:06:15.635 --> 02:06:19.370\nSo we brought in a production manager, he\nwas able to get the inventory to where it\n\n2745\n02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:23.330\nneeded, the order in where it needed to\nbe, so we could do 72 hour shipping time.\n\n2746\n02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:25.521\nTry before you buy demo\ndays I just talked about.\n\n2747\n02:06:25.521 --> 02:06:28.708\nConsistent voice across channels,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n2748\n02:06:28.708 --> 02:06:32.880\nI'll reiterate it, you have to have\na consistent voice across channels.\n\n2749\n02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:35.360\nSo if you have someone over here\ndoing your social media for you, and\n\n2750\n02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:37.310\nsomeone over here doing your marketing for\nyou, and\n\n2751\n02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:39.160\nsomeone over here who's\nanswering your phone,\n\n2752\n02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:43.330\nand they're all doing it in a different\nway, that's not consistent, is it?\n\n2753\n02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:46.090\nEveryone's gotta be having\nthe same voice in your company, so\n\n2754\n02:06:46.090 --> 02:06:49.890\nno matter what channel I'm on,\nI'm having the same experience.\n\n2755\n02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:53.127\nThe other thing we did\nthat was really cool and\n\n2756\n02:06:53.127 --> 02:06:55.690\nit solved a problem for\nDiveRite that was really huge.\n\n2757\n02:06:55.690 --> 02:06:58.290\nWhen you're trying to say to\nthe world that you are a company\n\n2758\n02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:02.370\nabout exploration and adventure,\nand you wanna show that visually,\n\n2759\n02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:04.460\nit's not like everybody can\njump in a cave with you and\n\n2760\n02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:07.680\ntake pictures of what you're doing and\nyour gear in action, right.\n\n2761\n02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.240\nSo they were doing these really\nexpensive photo shoots and\n\n2762\n02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:12.870\nvideo shoots were costing them $20,000.\n\n2763\n02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:15.300\nAnd of course what would happen,\nyou'd shoot all the gear,\n\n2764\n02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:17.640\nyou'd shoot all the divers\nin their gear from the team,\n\n2765\n02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.690\nand then six months later, they came up\nwith a new product and it was obsolete.\n\n2766\n02:07:20.690 --> 02:07:21.350\nIt was killing them.\n\n2767\n02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:23.490\nSo a lot of does not makes sense.\n\n2768\n02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:24.690\nNot only is it my budget,\n\n2769\n02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:29.010\nwhat we need to spend money on, we really\nneed to start really focusing not so\n\n2770\n02:07:29.010 --> 02:07:33.520\nmuch on the scene say,\nlook at my gear in the water, we get it.\n\n2771\n02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.370\nWe need to show the spirit of adventure.\n\n2772\n02:07:35.370 --> 02:07:36.690\nThat's all people care about.\n\n2773\n02:07:36.690 --> 02:07:39.420\nSo in a lot of these pictures, these\npeople aren't even wearing DiveRite gear,\n\n2774\n02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:42.610\nand I don't care as long as I can't\nsee the logo of what they're wearing.\n\n2775\n02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:46.310\nAnd as long as it wasn't obvious that they\nwere wearing someone or another's brand\n\n2776\n02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:51.120\nbecause of the shape, we used to say\nto people who were adventure divers.\n\n2777\n02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:52.630\nWe said send us in your photos.\n\n2778\n02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:55.030\nWe did a photo contest every year for\nseven years.\n\n2779\n02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:59.500\nWe gave them $1,500 for first prize\nof gear, $1,000 worth of gear for\n\n2780\n02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.914\nsecond prize, and 500 for third prize.\n\n2781\n02:08:01.914 --> 02:08:05.757\nWell how much does that\n1,500 retail gear cost me?\n\n2782\n02:08:05.757 --> 02:08:06.606\nNothing, right?\n\n2783\n02:08:06.606 --> 02:08:07.526\nDepending on what the product is.\n\n2784\n02:08:07.526 --> 02:08:08.624\nA couple hundred bucks.\n\n2785\n02:08:08.624 --> 02:08:10.270\nAnd I was getting world-class photography.\n\n2786\n02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:12.800\nSo these two shots here of this\nguy hanging on the line and\n\n2787\n02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:15.860\nthen this cave diver coming over\nthis little mound underwater.\n\n2788\n02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.180\nAnd then if we go back, look at this.\n\n2789\n02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:20.470\nHow would I ever stage this?\n\n2790\n02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:24.370\nA re-breather diver with a shark\ncoming right in front of him.\n\n2791\n02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:27.380\nWhich fits so wonderfully,\ncuz with the rebreather it's bubble-less.\n\n2792\n02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.030\nAnd if you don't have bubbles,\nsharks will come near you.\n\n2793\n02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:32.840\nWould I have staged that\nin a photoshoot ever?\n\n2794\n02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.700\nHere, sharky, sharky.\n\n2795\n02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:36.670\nNo, this is like gold.\n\n2796\n02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:38.550\nThat cost me a couple hundred bucks.\n\n2797\n02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:40.930\nThis guy, who's taking a shot of his,\n\n2798\n02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:43.990\nI can't remember if it's his girlfriend or\nwho was in front of him.\n\n2799\n02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:46.340\nGoing down the line, right?\n\n2800\n02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:47.290\nThat's awesome.\n\n2801\n02:08:47.290 --> 02:08:49.340\nThat's really expensive to shoot.\n\n2802\n02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.060\nAnd she's like head to toe in our gear.\n\n2803\n02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.220\nThat was wonderful.\n\n2804\n02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:53.330\nAnd guess what happens?\n\n2805\n02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:55.410\nSo when they win the photo contest,\nwe're sending them our gear.\n\n2806\n02:08:55.410 --> 02:08:56.850\nAnd guess what?\nThey're going to take another picture.\n\n2807\n02:08:56.850 --> 02:08:58.640\nAnd next year they're\ngoing to be in our gear.\n\n2808\n02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:01.085\nSo this was a great way again\nto really start building and\n\n2809\n02:09:01.085 --> 02:09:02.510\ninculcating this community.\n\n2810\n02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:04.470\nAnd it's another way to\nsolve that heaven and hell.\n\n2811\n02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.920\nDivers wanna talk about\ntheir dive stories.\n\n2812\n02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.640\nThat's not necessarily\nrelated to the purchase.\n\n2813\n02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.420\nBut by doing this photo contest,\n\n2814\n02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:12.560\nthey really felt like they were\npart of this brand, right?\n\n2815\n02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:15.860\nAnd then the last thing we did,\nor two other things.\n\n2816\n02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:19.000\nTransparent recall and\nSNAFU communication.\n\n2817\n02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.960\nWhen the company did have the inevitable,\n\n2818\n02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:23.460\nlike the product didn't work\nlike it was supposed to.\n\n2819\n02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:27.110\nWe had this problem once with the fins\nwhere the manufacture who was making\n\n2820\n02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:29.130\nthe thins for us changed the plastic so\n\n2821\n02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:32.200\nthat two different types of\nplastic wouldn't meld together.\n\n2822\n02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:34.040\nAnd after few months they will split.\n\n2823\n02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.000\nIt took a year for that to be solved.\n\n2824\n02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:37.910\nOne year.\n\n2825\n02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:39.210\nAll of those divers were out of fins.\n\n2826\n02:09:39.210 --> 02:09:41.120\nAnd there's nothing we could do.\n\n2827\n02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:41.750\nSo you know what we did?\n\n2828\n02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:43.660\nWe just got on camera and\ntold them what happened.\n\n2829\n02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.120\nAnd we're like, we are so\nsorry this happened.\n\n2830\n02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:46.710\nWe're gonna send you a mask and\nas soon as they're in,\n\n2831\n02:09:46.710 --> 02:09:48.120\nwe're gonna send you these fins.\n\n2832\n02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:50.700\nWe understand you have to go out and\nbuy new fins to replace these.\n\n2833\n02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:53.750\nBut you're still gonna get\nour fins when these come in.\n\n2834\n02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:54.740\nAnd you know what happened?\n\n2835\n02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:56.550\nWhen they finally came in,\nguess what everybody did?\n\n2836\n02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:59.700\nWe sold more fins that year that\nthose came in than we'd sold\n\n2837\n02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:01.010\nthe two years prior.\n\n2838\n02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:03.350\nCuz people believed us,\ncuz we were honest and transparent.\n\n2839\n02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.300\nAnd we put it out there.\n\n2840\n02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.190\nAnd then finally we did service guides and\nproduct manuals.\n\n2841\n02:10:07.190 --> 02:10:10.500\nOne of the problems that divers\nhave is lights, for example.\n\n2842\n02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:11.985\nPeople are always coming\nout with new lights.\n\n2843\n02:10:11.985 --> 02:10:14.860\nThey come out with a new light every\nsix months, nine months, every year.\n\n2844\n02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.920\nYou throw your product\nmanual away when you get it.\n\n2845\n02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.139\nTwo years later, you're sitting there\nwith a two-year-old dive light and\n\n2846\n02:10:19.139 --> 02:10:20.460\nyou have a question about maintenance.\n\n2847\n02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:22.250\nAnd then you're like\nwhere's the product manual?\n\n2848\n02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:24.382\nI got to write to the company,\nget a product manual.\n\n2849\n02:10:24.382 --> 02:10:26.323\nAnd we just put that in a library.\n\n2850\n02:10:26.323 --> 02:10:27.357\nSo it's really easy for\n\n2851\n02:10:27.357 --> 02:10:30.220\nyou to access manuals all\nthe way back to the early '90s.\n\n2852\n02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.760\nIf you had like a really\nold dive computer.\n\n2853\n02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.180\nAnd people love this.\n\n2854\n02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:37.790\nAgain, we're solving their problem\nbeyond that initial transaction.\n\n2855\n02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:39.360\nAll right, so let's talk about results.\n\n2856\n02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:44.950\nQualitatively, customer loyalty poured\ninto the online forums and social media.\n\n2857\n02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:46.260\nWe already talked about that.\n\n2858\n02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:47.760\nPeople became raving fans.\n\n2859\n02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:51.460\nThey went from throwing\ntomatoes to defending us.\n\n2860\n02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:54.550\nAnd that's that pivot I was\ntalking about in the beginning.\n\n2861\n02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:57.050\nDive Rite went from how do I\nsolve all these headaches?\n\n2862\n02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:58.780\nHow do I get my dealer order size up?\n\n2863\n02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:02.530\nHow do I sell more?\nTo holy cow, how do I serve all these\n\n2864\n02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:06.075\npeople that are out there talking\nabout me and are excited about me?\n\n2865\n02:11:06.075 --> 02:11:09.840\nAnd this took about, it started about\nseven months after we started this.\n\n2866\n02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:11.200\nAnd then definitely in the next year.\n\n2867\n02:11:12.278 --> 02:11:15.190\nCustomer service transformed\nfrom those fire drills\n\n2868\n02:11:15.190 --> 02:11:17.260\nto becoming an industry\nleader in customer support.\n\n2869\n02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:19.420\nNobody could touch this, right?\n\n2870\n02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:21.360\nSo people could answer the phone and\nthey could be really nice.\n\n2871\n02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.770\nAnd there was certainly other\nknowledgeable manufacturers of dive\n\n2872\n02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:25.350\ngear out there.\n\n2873\n02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:26.700\nWe're not the other one\nwho owned knowledge.\n\n2874\n02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:29.510\nThere was other explorers\nwho had some dive gear.\n\n2875\n02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:31.680\nBut nobody had an interactive\nsolution finder.\n\n2876\n02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:33.170\nNobody had a video channel.\n\n2877\n02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:35.780\nNobody had that level of service.\n\n2878\n02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.300\nSo do you see how we're starting to\nseparate ourselves from our competition?\n\n2879\n02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:39.110\nNobody can touch this.\n\n2880\n02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:43.690\nIt's completely authentic and\nwe're investing in doing this.\n\n2881\n02:11:43.690 --> 02:11:46.570\nOur sales team could focus on\nselling versus the problem solving.\n\n2882\n02:11:46.570 --> 02:11:49.830\nAnd this was a really interesting\noutcome that we wouldn't have imagined.\n\n2883\n02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:52.610\nIt's very, very expensive of\ncourse to do magazine advertising.\n\n2884\n02:11:52.610 --> 02:11:55.280\nEspecially in a niche industry like this.\n\n2885\n02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.440\nThe media started chasing us for images.\n\n2886\n02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.090\nThe media started chasing us for\nproduct features.\n\n2887\n02:12:02.090 --> 02:12:04.780\nThey wanted to feature us\ncuz we had great content.\n\n2888\n02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:08.230\nSo we became almost a publishing\nhouse where the media was then\n\n2889\n02:12:08.230 --> 02:12:11.140\nborrowing our stuff and\ngiving us all this free press.\n\n2890\n02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:11.730\nIt was amazing.\n\n2891\n02:12:11.730 --> 02:12:13.780\nThere's no way we would have ever been\nable to afford that with our budget.\n\n2892\n02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:19.140\nOkay, quantitatively, the following\nyear after we launched all this,\n\n2893\n02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:22.050\nour sales grew 15%\nwithout any new products.\n\n2894\n02:12:22.050 --> 02:12:24.410\nAt that point we had no new products.\n\n2895\n02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:25.660\nThat was great.\nThis was about a $6\n\n2896\n02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:28.092\nmillion company that bumped\nup to a little over 6.7.\n\n2897\n02:12:28.092 --> 02:12:29.810\nThat was exciting.\n\n2898\n02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:30.580\nThat felt really good.\n\n2899\n02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:31.750\nThat was fun.\n\n2900\n02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:33.920\nAdvertising budget.\n\n2901\n02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:36.850\nWe spent about $165,000 on\nputting those things into place.\n\n2902\n02:12:36.850 --> 02:12:38.790\nThat was a $100,000 website, guys.\n\n2903\n02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:39.790\nAnd this was 2006.\n\n2904\n02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:41.510\nDon't let it scare you,\nthey don't cost that much now.\n\n2905\n02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:45.310\nBut it was custom and\nhad some pretty cool features.\n\n2906\n02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:46.280\nBut guess what?\n\n2907\n02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.389\nGuess how many times they updated that\nwebsite in the following seven years.\n\n2908\n02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:53.060\nZero.\n\n2909\n02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:57.030\nWe built it and then all we had to do\nwas continue to add content to it.\n\n2910\n02:12:57.030 --> 02:13:01.050\nSo our ad budget dropped 66%\nin years two through six.\n\n2911\n02:13:01.050 --> 02:13:03.950\nI already had the sales development guys\nout there doing their territory visits.\n\n2912\n02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:06.440\nSo now we were spending a little\nbit of money on those tech tours.\n\n2913\n02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.220\nWe were spending a little bit of\nmoney on our photo contest, right?\n\n2914\n02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:11.320\nAnd we're getting free press.\n\n2915\n02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:14.050\nOther than that,\nit was just time to produce the content.\n\n2916\n02:13:14.050 --> 02:13:15.290\nThat was it.\n\n2917\n02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:17.890\nAnd I'm not gonna say\nthat that's not hard.\n\n2918\n02:13:17.890 --> 02:13:21.790\nThat takes some commitment to continuing\nto write these product descriptions,\n\n2919\n02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:24.350\nto continuing to put the tips and\nthe videos out.\n\n2920\n02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:27.480\nObviously, we were trading money for\ntime there.\n\n2921\n02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.840\nBut boy,\nthat felt really good on the bottom line.\n\n2922\n02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.820\nTheir dealer base grew by 8%.\n\n2923\n02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:34.230\nThey became healthier because\nthey were more knowledgeable.\n\n2924\n02:13:34.230 --> 02:13:35.130\nThey were happier.\n\n2925\n02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:37.340\nAnd the average order size increased.\n\n2926\n02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:38.040\nThat felt really good.\n\n2927\n02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.050\nThat was really efficient.\n\n2928\n02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:41.040\nAgain, straight to the bottom line.\n\n2929\n02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.710\nTheir online presence,\nthis is a fascinating story.\n\n2930\n02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:47.420\nIf you would have typed in the words\nDive Rite, which is the company's name,\n\n2931\n02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:52.130\ninto the Internet when we started,\nthey would have come up on page 20.\n\n2932\n02:13:52.130 --> 02:13:53.890\nThat's horrible.\n\n2933\n02:13:53.890 --> 02:13:54.786\nThey had no SEO.\n\n2934\n02:13:54.786 --> 02:13:57.320\nAnd when I said their former\nwebsite wasn't up to snuff,\n\n2935\n02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.310\nit was all Flash driven.\n\n2936\n02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:00.845\nGoogle couldn't even read it.\n\n2937\n02:14:00.845 --> 02:14:02.585\nSo the only thing that was\ncoming up in her Dive Rite\n\n2938\n02:14:02.585 --> 02:14:03.915\nwas all their dealers\nwho carried their gear.\n\n2939\n02:14:03.915 --> 02:14:05.695\nYou couldn't even find the manufacturer.\n\n2940\n02:14:05.695 --> 02:14:07.545\nAt this point,\nthey were number one for Dive Rite.\n\n2941\n02:14:07.545 --> 02:14:10.825\nAnd for other terms, like cave diving,\ntrimix diving, technical diving,\n\n2942\n02:14:10.825 --> 02:14:13.355\nline arrows,\nall these long word search terms,\n\n2943\n02:14:13.355 --> 02:14:16.455\nthey were always in the top ten,\nusually the top five.\n\n2944\n02:14:16.455 --> 02:14:19.355\nSo that's great because\npeople need to see that.\n\n2945\n02:14:19.355 --> 02:14:21.245\nAnd then,\nwe also won an honorable mention.\n\n2946\n02:14:21.245 --> 02:14:25.290\nThe website won honorable mention at\nthe Webby's next to industry icon Nike.\n\n2947\n02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.330\nBoy, that feels good.\n\n2948\n02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:28.470\nWe've just built an iconic\nbrand foundation and\n\n2949\n02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:31.280\nwe're being recognized next\nto another iconic brand.\n\n2950\n02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.660\nHello, this works.\n\n2951\n02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.290\nOkay, guys, so let's stop there.\n\n2952\n02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:37.500\nI know we are almost out of time.\n\n2953\n02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.330\nI just have a couple more minutes on this.\n\n2954\n02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:43.210\nBut I want to talk about questions\nbecause I just kind of gave you a lot.\n\n2955\n02:14:43.210 --> 02:14:45.991\nQuestions?\nYes.\n\n2956\n02:14:45.991 --> 02:14:51.446\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] So for\nus, it's an opportunity\n\n2957\n02:14:51.446 --> 02:14:56.300\nto be present in front of our clients.\n\n2958\n02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:59.839\nFor us, our newsletter is kind\nof our service guide, and\n\n2959\n02:14:59.839 --> 02:15:03.500\nit just lets people know what\nwe're doing and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n2960\n02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:07.070\nSo why so quick to say [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n2961\n02:15:07.070 --> 02:15:08.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, in sum,\nyou answered your own question,\n\n2962\n02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:11.870\nbecause you said we're quick to\nlet people know what we're doing.\n\n2963\n02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:15.070\nNow, if I'm interested in what you're\ndoing, then I'm going to open that e-mail.\n\n2964\n02:15:15.070 --> 02:15:18.410\nBut if you're talking about you,\nyou see what I'm saying?\n\n2965\n02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.308\nThen, I'm not interested.\n\n2966\n02:15:19.308 --> 02:15:22.280\nSo in e-mail marketing, what we really\nwant to see is you talking about me.\n\n2967\n02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.770\nI can't say for\nsure without knowing your business and\n\n2968\n02:15:25.770 --> 02:15:28.200\nknowing what challenge you're trying\nto overcome with that newsletter.\n\n2969\n02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:30.920\nI probably shouldn't be so\nquick to say newsletters are just out.\n\n2970\n02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.760\nBut in general, in general,\nwe as consumers do not wanna open\n\n2971\n02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.850\nup an e-mail and have a whole\nbunch of different, a newspaper.\n\n2972\n02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:42.190\nA whole bunch of different stuff to read.\n\n2973\n02:15:42.190 --> 02:15:44.630\nI may have the best intentions,\nand I may open it, but\n\n2974\n02:15:44.630 --> 02:15:47.580\nI'm probably not reading all that, okay?\n\n2975\n02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:49.060\nInstead, what we wanna do,\nis we wanna think about,\n\n2976\n02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:50.910\nokay, how can we stay relevant?\n\n2977\n02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:54.930\nAnd how can we stay in touch and\nnurture that customer relationship\n\n2978\n02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:57.430\nby giving them something they\nactually wanna open, right?\n\n2979\n02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:59.860\nAnd a piece of information\nthat's interesting for them.\n\n2980\n02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:03.608\nSo, tell me a little bit more\nabout your company, again?\n\n2981\n02:16:03.608 --> 02:16:04.861\n&gt;&gt; We're construction management.\n\n2982\n02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:05.690\n&gt;&gt; Company?\n\n2983\n02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.036\n&gt;&gt; Commercial construction?\n&gt;&gt; Commercial [INAUDIBLE]\n\n2984\n02:16:07.036 --> 02:16:07.984\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n2985\n02:16:07.984 --> 02:16:11.730\nwhat are some of the problems I made?\n\n2986\n02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:15.849\nSo if I've already built some, sir, are\nyou doing repetitive builds for a certain?\n\n2987\n02:16:15.849 --> 02:16:17.183\n&gt;&gt; A bulk of our work is that, yeah.\n\n2988\n02:16:17.183 --> 02:16:20.464\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so maybe someone just built\nsomething, you built something for\n\n2989\n02:16:20.464 --> 02:16:22.772\nsomeone with some new innovative thing,\nright.\n\n2990\n02:16:22.772 --> 02:16:25.986\nBut instead of it making it like,\nhey, look what we did, say,\n\n2991\n02:16:25.986 --> 02:16:27.572\ndo you ever have this problem.\n\n2992\n02:16:27.572 --> 02:16:32.287\nOr remember guys how we've all had this\nproblem before when were building xyz?\n\n2993\n02:16:32.287 --> 02:16:35.841\nHere's this really cool solution you might\nwant to check out next time you get ready\n\n2994\n02:16:35.841 --> 02:16:36.708\nto do a project.\n\n2995\n02:16:36.708 --> 02:16:40.599\nCool, that's it, one thing in\nthat one email, that one piece.\n\n2996\n02:16:40.599 --> 02:16:44.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, know that I didn't\nidentify that we had a problem.\n\n2997\n02:16:44.705 --> 02:16:47.223\nI'm saying we could use a newsletter.\n\n2998\n02:16:47.223 --> 02:16:50.892\nBut we actually did some industry surveys\nthat turned out really, really well.\n\n2999\n02:16:50.892 --> 02:16:52.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n3000\n02:16:52.599 --> 02:16:54.625\n&gt;&gt; Really high percentage of high\nmarks coming back from that.\n\n3001\n02:16:54.625 --> 02:16:57.890\nBut that was just a tool,\nI was just curious why you quick to say,\n\n3002\n02:16:57.890 --> 02:16:58.456\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n3003\n02:16:58.456 --> 02:17:00.418\n&gt;&gt; Get rid of your newsletter.\n\n3004\n02:17:00.418 --> 02:17:06.104\nWe find that the most clicks that we have\non opening argues letters about people.\n\n3005\n02:17:06.104 --> 02:17:07.362\nPeople are interested in our people.\n\n3006\n02:17:07.362 --> 02:17:08.216\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n3007\n02:17:08.216 --> 02:17:11.524\n&gt;&gt; They hardly ever look at our projects,\nand so\n\n3008\n02:17:11.524 --> 02:17:15.629\nwe talk about internally,\nthat's our best resource.\n\n3009\n02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:17.424\nEverything promote is people are more, but\n\n3010\n02:17:17.424 --> 02:17:19.373\nthat seems to be what\npeople are interested in.\n\n3011\n02:17:19.373 --> 02:17:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n3012\n02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:24.183\nYeah, and it's not that people won't open\nit, again, it's if they're not consuming\n\n3013\n02:17:24.183 --> 02:17:27.199\nall that content, if you can give them\njust that piece that they're looking for.\n\n3014\n02:17:27.199 --> 02:17:28.821\nSo I'm not saying don't do email.\n\n3015\n02:17:28.821 --> 02:17:33.611\nWhat I'm saying is, if you can do it\nshorter and in more sound bites that can\n\n3016\n02:17:33.611 --> 02:17:37.809\nconsume it easier,\nnow I'm even more engaged with you, right?\n\n3017\n02:17:37.809 --> 02:17:41.001\nAnd especially if you give me something\nto walk away with that I can go\n\n3018\n02:17:41.001 --> 02:17:42.150\nuse in my world?\n\n3019\n02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:43.370\nThat's really powerful.\n\n3020\n02:17:43.370 --> 02:17:46.100\nSo is it that we shouldn't do newsletters,\n\n3021\n02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:48.640\nI think there's an opportunity\nto amplify what you're doing and\n\n3022\n02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:51.820\nget even more engagement about it and\nI love that people piece.\n\n3023\n02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:57.240\nBecause anytime we do an email we always\nwant to end it with that personalized,\n\n3024\n02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:58.760\nsomething about a person, right?\n\n3025\n02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:02.010\nWe don't wanna just\nsend it from team Kate.\n\n3026\n02:18:02.010 --> 02:18:03.520\nIt needs to be, hey, from Kate.\n\n3027\n02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.180\nAnd here's my picture and\nthat signature piece.\n\n3028\n02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:10.590\nAnd that's probably why people are really\ninto that because A, it's your culture.\n\n3029\n02:18:10.590 --> 02:18:14.020\nDo you think they also wanna know more\nabout how to create that culture?\n\n3030\n02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:15.960\nAre they trying to learn from\nyou about what you're doing or\n\n3031\n02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:18.450\nare they just interested in who\nyou are and what you're doing?\n\n3032\n02:18:18.450 --> 02:18:19.001\n&gt;&gt; I can't answer that,\n\n3033\n02:18:19.001 --> 02:18:19.803\nI don't [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n3034\n02:18:19.803 --> 02:18:22.740\nI mean those would be some good\nquestions to ask then, right?\n\n3035\n02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:25.440\nBecause maybe that is what they want\nto know, and you could give them that.\n\n3036\n02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:30.500\nThat's pretty cool, yeah, so I shouldn't\nbe so quick to say no newsletters.\n\n3037\n02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:32.230\nDo the email marketing, but\n\n3038\n02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:34.530\nmake sure that you're really\namplifying to get that engagement.\n\n3039\n02:18:34.530 --> 02:18:37.150\nThat they're clicking,\nthat they're emailing you back,\n\n3040\n02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:38.660\nI mean those are the kinds\nof things we want.\n\n3041\n02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:41.680\nWe don't want to just stay out in front\nof them, we want to engage with them.\n\n3042\n02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.978\nAnd usually quicker,\nshorter sound bites will do that.\n\n3043\n02:18:44.978 --> 02:18:46.897\n&gt;&gt; That's the way we present it but\n\n3044\n02:18:46.897 --> 02:18:50.246\nhe did say some things that'll\nhelp him through it but.\n\n3045\n02:18:50.246 --> 02:18:51.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n3046\n02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:54.357\n&gt;&gt; For us it worked, so I'm curious why.\n\n3047\n02:18:54.357 --> 02:18:56.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things that's\ninteresting about DiveRight,\n\n3048\n02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:57.399\nwe start out with that newsletter and\n\n3049\n02:18:57.399 --> 02:18:58.919\nwe had all the dealers on\nthe newsletter list too.\n\n3050\n02:18:58.919 --> 02:19:02.215\nAnd again, they would get to it if they\ncould, if they were having a slow moment.\n\n3051\n02:19:02.215 --> 02:19:04.539\nWe were always scared to\nemail them too frequently, so\n\n3052\n02:19:04.539 --> 02:19:07.431\nwe were doing these quarterly\nnewsletters and then we did monthly.\n\n3053\n02:19:07.431 --> 02:19:11.090\nAnd then we started emailing them every\nweek with just, again, sort of a tip.\n\n3054\n02:19:11.090 --> 02:19:14.092\nOr sometimes at the bottom of the tip\nthere might be a little special\n\n3055\n02:19:14.092 --> 02:19:18.150\nby the way, if you need any of these,\nthese are 50% off or $10 off or whatever.\n\n3056\n02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:22.220\nAnd our order size kept going up because\nit was just that little bit of a reminder.\n\n3057\n02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:25.718\nNow again, weekly for\nthat particular segment works.\n\n3058\n02:19:25.718 --> 02:19:29.220\nThat may not work in the construction,\nbecause you may not be building something\n\n3059\n02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:30.832\nnew every week and\nhave a new project every week.\n\n3060\n02:19:30.832 --> 02:19:33.550\nIt might be monthly or\nwhatever, but frequency, a lot\n\n3061\n02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:36.160\nof times we tend to give us security about\nfrequency, frequency is a good thing.\n\n3062\n02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.242\nThen we're not gonna spam people.\n\n3063\n02:19:38.242 --> 02:19:41.965\nIt's the content that's the spam\nnot the frequency usually.\n\n3064\n02:19:41.965 --> 02:19:43.290\nIf that helps at all.\n\n3065\n02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:47.945\nThank you, that was good insight.\n\n3066\n02:19:47.945 --> 02:19:49.215\nAnybody else?\n\n3067\n02:19:49.215 --> 02:19:50.559\nQuestions about Diver?\n\n3068\n02:19:50.559 --> 02:19:51.849\nQuestions about customer experience?\n\n3069\n02:19:51.849 --> 02:19:53.298\nHow many people in here,\n\n3070\n02:19:53.298 --> 02:19:57.097\nhow many of your companies\nare focusing on customer experience?\n\n3071\n02:19:57.097 --> 02:19:58.921\nYep, awesome.\n\n3072\n02:19:58.921 --> 02:20:01.364\nSo are you guys starting\nto map out those journeys?\n\n3073\n02:20:03.721 --> 02:20:04.895\nCool.\n\n3074\n02:20:04.895 --> 02:20:06.687\nDoes anybody have a journey\nthey want to share?\n\n3075\n02:20:10.548 --> 02:20:11.408\nStill in progress?\n\n3076\n02:20:11.408 --> 02:20:14.580\nWork in progress?\n\n3077\n02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:16.159\nYou guys are getting hungry?\n\n3078\n02:20:16.159 --> 02:20:20.170\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n3079\n02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:21.290\nLet's take a quick look.\n\n3080\n02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:22.000\nLet's see, how much time?\n\n3081\n02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.710\nBill, my time's up, right?\n\n3082\n02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:25.098\nI got a couple of minutes.\n\n3083\n02:20:25.098 --> 02:20:26.470\n&gt;&gt; You can take a few more minutes.\n\n3084\n02:20:26.470 --> 02:20:29.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAll right, so a couple of things.\n\n3085\n02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:31.580\nSo we have two pages on\ncustomer experience.\n\n3086\n02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:34.150\nWe don't have to necessarily turn in this\ncuz there's a lot of questions right now.\n\n3087\n02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:37.580\nBut I want you guys to know that this is\na guide as you're working like a customer\n\n3088\n02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:42.040\nexperience journey,\nwhere it really helps you think through\n\n3089\n02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:45.190\nhow that customer is first gonna hear\nabout you all the way over here,\n\n3090\n02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:49.040\nall the way through to the end of that\nexperience and back around again.\n\n3091\n02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:52.340\nSo like that newsletter or like that\nemail, we got to keep them in touch.\n\n3092\n02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:55.410\nHow do we keep in touch if they're\ndoing the one off service?\n\n3093\n02:20:55.410 --> 02:20:56.850\nHow do we do those types of things?\n\n3094\n02:20:56.850 --> 02:20:59.066\nLike my insurance company for my home,\n\n3095\n02:20:59.066 --> 02:21:02.434\nthey're the only insurance\ncarrier that I even remember.\n\n3096\n02:21:02.434 --> 02:21:03.415\nWe own three homes.\n\n3097\n02:21:03.415 --> 02:21:04.834\nWe have a couple of rental properties.\n\n3098\n02:21:04.834 --> 02:21:06.523\nThe only ones I remember are them,\n\n3099\n02:21:06.523 --> 02:21:10.430\nbecause they send me smoke alarm\nbatteries every December, right?\n\n3100\n02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:13.620\nOnce a year, one touch a year, that\nalways make me feel good that they do it.\n\n3101\n02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:14.990\nI get it, I'm a marketer, right?\n\n3102\n02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:17.190\nBut only, it's so\nnice you sent me smoke alarm batteries but\n\n3103\n02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:19.400\nwhat they're really doing is like we\nhope you don't burn down your house\n\n3104\n02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.140\nbecause that's going to be\nreally expensive for us too.\n\n3105\n02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.380\nBut they care, it feels like they care.\n\n3106\n02:21:23.380 --> 02:21:26.139\nSo that's part of that\ncustomer experience that\n\n3107\n02:21:26.139 --> 02:21:28.908\nextends beyond just that\ntransactional piece.\n\n3108\n02:21:28.908 --> 02:21:32.223\nI don't get homeowners insurance\nevery day or every year but\n\n3109\n02:21:32.223 --> 02:21:36.290\nwhen someone moves next door,\nwho do I say that they should use?\n\n3110\n02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:36.990\nThis company, right?\n\n3111\n02:21:36.990 --> 02:21:41.220\nBecause they're keeping on top of mine and\nit feels good, right?\n\n3112\n02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:44.620\nSo that's a great example of another piece\nof that customer experience journey.\n\n3113\n02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:47.190\nIt's giving you kind of some\nquestions to really look through\n\n3114\n02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:49.230\nall the different places that\nyou might want to explore.\n\n3115\n02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:52.090\nYou're going to have a lot\nmore than what's on here.\n\n3116\n02:21:52.090 --> 02:21:56.649\nAnd then it's gonna ask you some questions\nabout how do you get a process in place?\n\n3117\n02:21:56.649 --> 02:21:59.135\nCuz customers experience\nrequires process and measurement.\n\n3118\n02:21:59.135 --> 02:21:59.880\nIt really does.\n\n3119\n02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:02.830\nIt's not just something like,\nhey I think everybody is happier.\n\n3120\n02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:08.630\nCustomer experience is not necessarily\nalways an inexpensive thing to do,\n\n3121\n02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:09.450\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n3122\n02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:10.340\nSo you wanna measure it.\n\n3123\n02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:10.920\nIs it working?\n\n3124\n02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:12.570\nYou need to be talking to your customers.\n\n3125\n02:22:12.570 --> 02:22:15.610\nYou need to be talking to your teams\ncuz their gonna hear that feedback,\n\n3126\n02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:17.270\nand then you need to be measuring.\n\n3127\n02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:19.970\nIf you are doing some data analytics,\nyou need to be measuring,\n\n3128\n02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:22.820\nwhether you're measuring in how they're\ncoming in that door, how many clicks,\n\n3129\n02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.290\nhow many conversions, and\nthose types of things.\n\n3130\n02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:29.250\nHow is that working for you,\nhowever that measurement technique is?\n\n3131\n02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:32.100\nAre your employees empowered to\nsolve that customer experience?\n\n3132\n02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:34.190\nWe were talking about this\na little bit ago on the break.\n\n3133\n02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:36.930\nYou know, the employees are the people\nthat need to be coming up with these\n\n3134\n02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:38.790\nideas, not necessarily us.\n\n3135\n02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:40.800\nWe can certainly lend\nto that conversation.\n\n3136\n02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:44.500\nAnd it just gives you some opportunities\nto sort of list out some team members,\n\n3137\n02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:47.530\nthat you could say hey you know what, I\nthink you would be a great team leader for\n\n3138\n02:22:47.530 --> 02:22:49.120\nthis area.\n\n3139\n02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:51.030\nGo ignite this.\n\n3140\n02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:53.119\nI'm just telling you I'm going\nto be here to support you.\n\n3141\n02:22:53.119 --> 02:22:55.273\nYou come back to me with ideas.\n\n3142\n02:22:55.273 --> 02:22:57.268\nOkay, cool.\n\n3143\n02:22:57.268 --> 02:22:59.508\nLet's go through our pillar five.\n\n3144\n02:22:59.508 --> 02:23:02.210\nThis is really short and\nthen we'll move onto to lunch.\n\n3145\n02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:05.080\nAlright, challenge your marketing\nthinking, pillar number five.\n\n3146\n02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:08.090\nOne of the things that Mary Kay did so,\nso, so\n\n3147\n02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:09.460\nwell when she first started her company.\n\n3148\n02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:12.140\nShe immediately surrounded herself\nwith the experts she needed to build\n\n3149\n02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:13.320\nthe company,\n\n3150\n02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:17.450\nbecause really what she wanted to do is\nshe wanted to go work with those women.\n\n3151\n02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:21.190\nShe did not want to balance the balance\nsheet, she did not want to spend time\n\n3152\n02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:24.600\nmarketing, she wanted to be in\nsales working with those women.\n\n3153\n02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:27.950\nAnd the very first thing Mary Kay used to\ntell every woman who came into the company\n\n3154\n02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:31.850\nwhether they were a beauty consultant who\nare now gonna have their own business, or\n\n3155\n02:23:31.850 --> 02:23:36.860\nwhether they were one of us employees\nis like you need a housekeeper.\n\n3156\n02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:39.390\nSo I know it's a very 1960s thing to say\nbut and she said you need a house keeper,\n\n3157\n02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:40.490\nyou cannot do it all.\n\n3158\n02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:43.200\nYou have to surround yourself with people\nwho are really good at what they do and\n\n3159\n02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.970\nyou are no longer good at keeping\nhouse cuz you are not there.\n\n3160\n02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:48.120\nSo, someone else needs to do it.\n\n3161\n02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:52.010\nIf you ran her company the same way,\nshe's like you have to invest.\n\n3162\n02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:55.668\nSo she's like I don't care if you just\nscraped together $100 to buy this beauty\n\n3163\n02:23:55.668 --> 02:23:57.758\nkit, now go scrape together $75 or $50 or\n\n3164\n02:23:57.758 --> 02:24:00.852\nwhatever you need to go pay\na housekeeper for this week.\n\n3165\n02:24:00.852 --> 02:24:03.961\nWe're gonna start there and we are going\nto start with a good foundation.\n\n3166\n02:24:03.961 --> 02:24:05.126\nSo I love that.\n\n3167\n02:24:05.126 --> 02:24:09.118\nSo There is two reasons that marketing\nfails and this is like super simple guys.\n\n3168\n02:24:09.118 --> 02:24:13.024\nAnd I know its just over simplifying, this\nbut look, we either lack a good marketing\n\n3169\n02:24:13.024 --> 02:24:16.500\nstrategy and that's really what\nwe've been talking about today.\n\n3170\n02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:21.480\nThe strategies are in that, the 4Ps,\nthat product or the marketing mix.\n\n3171\n02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:24.620\nThey are strategies in that\npromotional piece, but\n\n3172\n02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:27.260\nreally we're talking about\nthe strategic foundation\n\n3173\n02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:31.500\nthat even when we have some baubles on\nthat stuff on top is gonna hold you up.\n\n3174\n02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:34.120\nThe other thing that happens,\nI've seen this happen time and time again.\n\n3175\n02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.980\nA lot of times people have\nan amazing marketing strategy, but\n\n3176\n02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:39.330\nwe're falling down on execution.\n\n3177\n02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:41.880\nWe don't know how to execute so well.\n\n3178\n02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:42.780\nWhen you go back and\n\n3179\n02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:46.750\nlook at that genetics company,\nsomeone thought through all those details.\n\n3180\n02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:48.110\nWould you not agree?\n\n3181\n02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:50.850\nThat was really well\nexecuted strategically.\n\n3182\n02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:53.970\nIt wasn't just like,\nhey grey would be a cool color.\n\n3183\n02:24:53.970 --> 02:24:57.420\nThat guy, he does really good art,\nlet's get him.\n\n3184\n02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:02.210\nIt was, how do we really execute against\nour why and what the customer wants.\n\n3185\n02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:04.750\nSo poor strategic execution can kill you.\n\n3186\n02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.110\nOkay, so\nwho challenges your thinking, guys?\n\n3187\n02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.780\nRight?\nSo\n\n3188\n02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:12.570\nwho in your company is challenging\nyour marketing thinking?\n\n3189\n02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:16.590\nDo you have a marketer at your leadership\ntable to challenge the status quo and\n\n3190\n02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:19.600\ninspire that new thinking for you, right?\n\n3191\n02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.470\nBecause when we're talking about marketing\nand everything I've showed you today,\n\n3192\n02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.640\nit wasn't just a promotional piece.\n\n3193\n02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.300\nIt was, hey,\nwe're getting ready to hire somebody new.\n\n3194\n02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:28.770\nOkay.\nWhat are your hiring practices like?\n\n3195\n02:25:28.770 --> 02:25:30.220\nWhat's that job description gonna be like?\n\n3196\n02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:33.680\nIs that gonna be out on the internet or\nyou're gonna go to a show or\n\n3197\n02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.210\na trade show or employment show?\n\n3198\n02:25:35.210 --> 02:25:36.790\nHow's that gonna happen?\n\n3199\n02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:39.050\nIs that in line with your why?\n\n3200\n02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:40.190\nHey.\nNow, here's the phone call.\n\n3201\n02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:42.800\nWho is there asking you about your phones?\n\n3202\n02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.660\nWho's answering your phones?\n\n3203\n02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:44.720\nWhat's that like?\n\n3204\n02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:45.860\nWhat's your answering service like?\n\n3205\n02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:47.510\nAre you recording calls?\n\n3206\n02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:49.810\nIs there a guy on the recording or\na woman on the recording?\n\n3207\n02:25:49.810 --> 02:25:51.410\nAll of these things, right?\n\n3208\n02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:54.720\nSo, who's inside the company\nchallenging all these little pieces,\n\n3209\n02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:58.440\nbecause effective marketing represents the\ncustomer throughout your entire company.\n\n3210\n02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.920\nEvery action.\n\n3211\n02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.170\nThe way you pay your bills.You know,\nif you have, you know,\n\n3212\n02:26:03.170 --> 02:26:06.230\nwhatever the terms you've negotiated,\nyou better be playing on those terms.\n\n3213\n02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:09.770\nBecause if you're just paying late,\nwhat's happening to your vendors?\n\n3214\n02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:10.640\nAre they loving on you?\n\n3215\n02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.270\nNo!\n\n3216\n02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:12.350\nWhat are they doing?\n\n3217\n02:26:12.350 --> 02:26:14.990\nThey're going home and\ntelling their spouses and their kids and\n\n3218\n02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:17.400\neveryone else in their water\ncooler that you stink.\n\n3219\n02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:20.380\nRight?\nSo you have to think about that.\n\n3220\n02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.900\nMarketing really goes throughout\nour entire organization.\n\n3221\n02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:25.250\nIt's well beyond the promotional peace and\nthe PPPP.\n\n3222\n02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:28.990\nSo that bomb proof marketing though\ncomes with experience, right?\n\n3223\n02:26:28.990 --> 02:26:31.143\nIt's more than good ideas.\n\n3224\n02:26:31.143 --> 02:26:34.420\nWe can have good ideas, and we can have\ngood intuition, and it's really cool to\n\n3225\n02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:39.340\nhave someone internally who has\ngood ideas, but we also have to\n\n3226\n02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:42.800\nhave some experience that we know what's\ngonna work is really working, right?\n\n3227\n02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.200\nSo make sure that you're getting that\nchallenge cuz you guys deserve that and\n\n3228\n02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:47.300\nyour companies deserve that.\n\n3229\n02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.860\nOkay, that wraps up number five.\n\n3230\n02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:52.940\nI told you it was gonna be short.\n\n3231\n02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:58.190\nIf I can help you guys in any way, you\nare welcome to call or schedule a call and\n\n3232\n02:26:58.190 --> 02:27:00.590\nwe can chat, complimentary,\nabsolutely free, okay?\n\n3233\n02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:03.850\nAnd I'm also here for a little bit\nif you guys have any questions.\n\n3234\n02:27:06.807 --> 02:27:08.530\nI was trying to see if there's\nanything else we have here.\n\n3235\n02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:10.010\nYeah, and so there's pillar number five.\n\n3236\n02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:11.450\nI just wanted to make\nsure I included that.\n\n3237\n02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:13.650\nSo pillar number five,\nwho do you have challenging you?\n\n3238\n02:27:13.650 --> 02:27:15.180\nYou guys can answer that as well.\n\n3239\n02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:15.890\nSo please take this.\n\n3240\n02:27:15.890 --> 02:27:18.422\nIt's a tool for you and\nI hope it's been helpful.\n\n3241\n02:27:18.422 --> 02:27:22.635\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
