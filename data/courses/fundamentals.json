          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.647\n[SOUND] In this video we're gonna\n\n2\n00:00:02.647 --> 00:00:07.539\ntake a look at the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\ncertification.\n\n3\n00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:09.036\nNow if you haven't heard of it,\n\n4\n00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.240\nthe IT Fundamentals certification is one\nof many certifications from CompTIA.\n\n5\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.590\nAnd it's designed for\npeople who want to get into IT but\n\n6\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.340\nhave little or even no experience.\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.640\nA lot of people wonder hey if I'm\ngonna get into IT where do I start?\n\n8\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.020\nThis is literally the starting point.\n\n9\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.820\nIf you have zero experience you've never\nreally worked with computers much at all\n\n10\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.900\nand you wanna get into IT,\nthis is it, this is the beginning.\n\n11\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.530\nNow ComTIA publishes a roadmap to help\nus figure out where to get started and\n\n12\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.310\nobviously IT fundamentals is\ngonna be at the beginning.\n\n13\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.530\nWell let's take a look at that roadmap and\nI'll show you how it fits in.\n\n14\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.060\nNow ComTIA likes to break things\nup based on your job role or\n\n15\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.870\nwhat type of job you're looking to pursue.\n\n16\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.630\nAnd so we've got things like\ninformation security, network and\n\n17\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.650\ncloud technologies, hardware services and\ninfrastructure, IT management and\n\n18\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.000\nstrategy, storage data, web and mobile,\nsoftware development, and even training,\n\n19\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.610\nif you wanna become an instructor.\n\n20\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.920\nAnd all of these have\na very common element.\n\n21\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.950\nIf you look at the very beginning,\nwhere they tell you to get started.\n\n22\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.580\nYou'll see CompTIA IT Fundamentals right\nthere at the beginning for each and\n\n23\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.130\nevery one of them.\n\n24\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.570\nThe idea being that,\nif you're going to get into IT,\n\n25\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.530\nthere's some basic knowledge that\nyou need to have to get started.\n\n26\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.670\nSo now we know what\nthe IT Fundamental Certification is,\n\n27\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.530\nwhat do we need to know to pass the exam?\n\n28\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.400\nWell, let's take a look at the exam\nobjectives, see what it covers.\n\n29\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.240\nCompTIA publishes the exam objectives\nthat you know what to study and\n\n30\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.850\nyou make sure that you\nprepared to get that exam.\n\n31\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.940\nAnd the way it works, is it basically\nbreaks down all the information\n\n32\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.730\nyou need to know into five domains,\nfive different areas of knowledge.\n\n33\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.260\nAnd each one makes up\na portion of the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.840\nYou'll see some are more\nimportant than others.\n\n35\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.810\nFor example, we've got basic IT literacy.\n\n36\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.360\nIn other words, just understanding the\nterminology and jargon that we use in IT,\n\n37\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.910\nthat's 24% of the exam,\nit's almost a quarter of the exam.\n\n38\n00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.420\nVersus networking for\nexample which is only 16% of the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.920\nit's a smaller portion of that exam.\n\n40\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.890\nIt's important knowledge to know but\n\n41\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.840\nnot everyone gets involved in\nnetworking every single day.\n\n42\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.780\nCompTIA has arranged these so\n\n43\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.920\nthey're weighted based on their\nimportance out there in the real world.\n\n44\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.980\nAnd IT fundamentals is a pretty\ngeneralized certification.\n\n45\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.270\nIn other words once you get certified in\nthis you get the fundamental knowledge,\n\n46\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.100\nyou then start kind of narrowing\nyour focus into the particular\n\n47\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.960\nfield that you want to move into, right?\n\n48\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.430\nSo this is gonna be a little\nbit on the general side.\n\n49\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.920\nNow each one of these domains is made up\nof a number of different topics, so for\n\n50\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.600\nexample software, right, 1.0 software.\n\n51\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.980\nIf we take a look at that one it's divided\nup into a number of different things.\n\n52\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.351\nMobile operating systems, desktop\nworkstations, software compatibility,\n\n53\n00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.542\nawareness of hardware compatibility.\n\n54\n00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:47.022\nAll of these are things we need to\nknow to keep our software running and\n\n55\n00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:49.362\noperational and\nto be able to troubleshoot and\n\n56\n00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:52.690\nfix it when it's not working\nthe way that it's supposed to.\n\n57\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.630\nThese are all topics that we need to know.\n\n58\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.430\nSo you'll see these divisions\nInside each of the domains,\n\n59\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.140\nas they kind of tailor to\nthe topics that you wanna cover.\n\n60\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.260\nBut just at a high level, software.\n\n61\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.220\nThose are the programs that\nwe run on our computer, and\n\n62\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.950\nthey're the things that we\ninteract with on a daily basis.\n\n63\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540\nFor most of us, when we use a computer\nwe don't necessarily care what hardware\n\n64\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.620\nit has, it's the software that we use.\n\n65\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.976\nThat's what we interact with,\nthat's what important to us and so\n\n66\n00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.890\nwe need to understand how that works.\n\n67\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.210\nSecond is hardware.\n\n68\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.900\nHardware is what actually powers\neverything behind the scenes.\n\n69\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.960\nThe hard drive, memory, CPU,\nall of those components.\n\n70\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.720\nAnd we don't think about them\na lot until they break and\n\n71\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.060\nthey malfunction or our system is\nrunning slow and we wanna upgrade.\n\n72\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.610\nAll of a sudden understanding what\nthat hardware is, is really important.\n\n73\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.300\nWhen you're looking at a sale and\nadvertisement in the newspaper and you see\n\n74\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.790\ntwo different computers and they're\nfour or $500 difference, why is that?\n\n75\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.530\nWhat are the components that make\none worth more than the other?\n\n76\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.970\nUnderstanding hardware is what's going\nto help you to answer that question.\n\n77\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.200\nAll right, then we've got security.\n\n78\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.490\nSecurity is really important.\n\n79\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.710\nYou'll see it's 21% of the exam.\n\n80\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.170\nIt's another one that's a fairly\nlarge category on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.530\nAnd that's because you\nsee every single week\n\n82\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.010\narticles that are being posted about\ncompanies that have been compromised.\n\n83\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.110\nWhere data has been leaked\nonto the Internet or\n\n84\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.140\nhackers have broken into a system and\nstolen credit card data.\n\n85\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.340\nThat's not good and\n\n86\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.850\na lot of it is easily avoidable if we\ntake the proper security precautions.\n\n87\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.810\nSo in the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nCertification you get\n\n88\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.380\nan introduction to security.\n\n89\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.280\nThat needs to be a fundamental, it needs\nto be a part of everything you do in\n\n90\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.080\nIT regardless of your actual job role,\nIT security is always important.\n\n91\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.060\nIn 4.0 we've got networking,\n\n92\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.750\nit's rare these days to have a computer\nthat is just standing alone by itself.\n\n93\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.880\nWe almost always have it connect\nto a network like the Internet.\n\n94\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.020\nSo how do we do that?\n\n95\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.180\nHow do we get connected to the Internet?\n\n96\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.850\nHow do we talk between two computers?\n\n97\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.090\nHow do we share a printer so\nwe don't have to buy multiple printers?\n\n98\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.060\nWe could have more than one computer\nall using the same printer.\n\n99\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110\nThat's all the basic\nfundamentals of networking.\n\n100\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.690\nAnd then lastly, IT literacy,\n\n101\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.250\nI kind of mentioned already,\nwhich is understanding the jargon.\n\n102\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.110\nIT man it is acronym soup.\n\n103\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.870\nYou have tons and\ntons of letters being thrown around and\n\n104\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.220\nsometimes they're said like letters,\nsometimes they're said like fake words.\n\n105\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.470\nYou've got scuzzy and PCI, CPU, RAM.\n\n106\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.790\nWhat do all these mean?\n\n107\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.620\nWe need to make sure we understand\nthat jargon, otherwise you just get\n\n108\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.180\nreally confused when you move\ninto the more advanced topics.\n\n109\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.590\nSo these are the things that make\nup the IT fundamentals exam and\n\n110\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.940\nyou'll see each one is very important\nregardless of whether your goal\n\n111\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.250\nis to go into systems administration,\nnetwork administration,\n\n112\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.940\nif you wanna be an IT security officer,\ngoing into management.\n\n113\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.520\nThese are topics that every one of\nus should know and be aware of.\n\n114\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.320\nAll right,\nnow when you're ready to take the exam,\n\n115\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.210\nlet's talk a little bit about\nthe actual exam itself, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.210\nThe exam is a multiple choice\nexam that's computer based.\n\n117\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.510\nYou'll actually go to\na VUE testing center,\n\n118\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.780\nPearson VUE is a company that has\ntesting centers all over the world.\n\n119\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.180\nYou'll go to one of their centers,\nyou'll sit down at a computer, and\n\n120\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.890\nyou'll take a multiple choice exam.\n\n121\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.770\nOn a positive note, that means\nyou'll get your results right away,\n\n122\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.535\nwhich is exciting.\n\n123\n00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:03.710\nSo you can go and take the test and\nget the certification all on the same day\n\n124\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.910\nhave something great right\nthere on your resume.\n\n125\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.320\nThe exam is 75 questions, so\nit's not too terribly large.\n\n126\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.420\nBut you do only have 60 minutes,\nwhich means you don't wanna mess around.\n\n127\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.400\nIf you spend 1 minute per question, well,\nyou're gonna run out of time on the exam\n\n128\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.920\nand you're not gonna get\nto the last 15 questions.\n\n129\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.290\nSo you need to know your content.\n\n130\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.640\nGet in there,\nanswer the questions, and move on.\n\n131\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.300\nThey are just multiple choice,\nthat does make it a little bit easier.\n\n132\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.495\nYou shouldn't have any problems completing\nit in the time you have allotted,\n\n133\n00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:31.140\nall right?\n\n134\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.560\nNow it is scored out of 1,000,\nyou need 650 to pass, so\n\n135\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.330\nthat's a pretty good passing mark and\nthe exam itself is $112 United States.\n\n136\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330\nAt least if you're in another country,\n\n137\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.000\nyou'll need to switch to the other pricing\nto see what that is gonna be like for you.\n\n138\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.180\nNow when you take the exam,\nyou do need to go to a VUE testing center.\n\n139\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.400\nAnd if you don't know about VUE,\n\n140\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.850\nif you haven't dealt with them before,\nyou're gonna deal with them a lot.\n\n141\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.940\nBecause CompTIA, Microsoft,\n\n142\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.430\nCISCO, all of the big computer vendors out\nthere use Pearson VUE for their testing.\n\n143\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.790\nSo to find a center near you, you just go\nto their website VUE's website is vue.com.\n\n144\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.500\nSo if you fire up your\nfavorite web browser and\n\n145\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.800\ngo to veu.com, it'll take you to the\nwebpage that I'm looking at right here.\n\n146\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.900\nAnd there's a link up in the top\nthat says for test takers.\n\n147\n00:07:16.900 -->
