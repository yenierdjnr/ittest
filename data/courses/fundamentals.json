          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.647\n[SOUND] In this video we're gonna\n\n2\n00:00:02.647 --> 00:00:07.539\ntake a look at the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\ncertification.\n\n3\n00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:09.036\nNow if you haven't heard of it,\n\n4\n00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.240\nthe IT Fundamentals certification is one\nof many certifications from CompTIA.\n\n5\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.590\nAnd it's designed for\npeople who want to get into IT but\n\n6\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.340\nhave little or even no experience.\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.640\nA lot of people wonder hey if I'm\ngonna get into IT where do I start?\n\n8\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.020\nThis is literally the starting point.\n\n9\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.820\nIf you have zero experience you've never\nreally worked with computers much at all\n\n10\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.900\nand you wanna get into IT,\nthis is it, this is the beginning.\n\n11\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.530\nNow ComTIA publishes a roadmap to help\nus figure out where to get started and\n\n12\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.310\nobviously IT fundamentals is\ngonna be at the beginning.\n\n13\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.530\nWell let's take a look at that roadmap and\nI'll show you how it fits in.\n\n14\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.060\nNow ComTIA likes to break things\nup based on your job role or\n\n15\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.870\nwhat type of job you're looking to pursue.\n\n16\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.630\nAnd so we've got things like\ninformation security, network and\n\n17\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.650\ncloud technologies, hardware services and\ninfrastructure, IT management and\n\n18\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.000\nstrategy, storage data, web and mobile,\nsoftware development, and even training,\n\n19\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.610\nif you wanna become an instructor.\n\n20\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.920\nAnd all of these have\na very common element.\n\n21\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.950\nIf you look at the very beginning,\nwhere they tell you to get started.\n\n22\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.580\nYou'll see CompTIA IT Fundamentals right\nthere at the beginning for each and\n\n23\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.130\nevery one of them.\n\n24\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.570\nThe idea being that,\nif you're going to get into IT,\n\n25\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.530\nthere's some basic knowledge that\nyou need to have to get started.\n\n26\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.670\nSo now we know what\nthe IT Fundamental Certification is,\n\n27\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.530\nwhat do we need to know to pass the exam?\n\n28\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.400\nWell, let's take a look at the exam\nobjectives, see what it covers.\n\n29\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.240\nCompTIA publishes the exam objectives\nthat you know what to study and\n\n30\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.850\nyou make sure that you\nprepared to get that exam.\n\n31\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.940\nAnd the way it works, is it basically\nbreaks down all the information\n\n32\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.730\nyou need to know into five domains,\nfive different areas of knowledge.\n\n33\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.260\nAnd each one makes up\na portion of the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.840\nYou'll see some are more\nimportant than others.\n\n35\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.810\nFor example, we've got basic IT literacy.\n\n36\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.360\nIn other words, just understanding the\nterminology and jargon that we use in IT,\n\n37\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.910\nthat's 24% of the exam,\nit's almost a quarter of the exam.\n\n38\n00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.420\nVersus networking for\nexample which is only 16% of the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.920\nit's a smaller portion of that exam.\n\n40\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.890\nIt's important knowledge to know but\n\n41\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.840\nnot everyone gets involved in\nnetworking every single day.\n\n42\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.780\nCompTIA has arranged these so\n\n43\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.920\nthey're weighted based on their\nimportance out there in the real world.\n\n44\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.980\nAnd IT fundamentals is a pretty\ngeneralized certification.\n\n45\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.270\nIn other words once you get certified in\nthis you get the fundamental knowledge,\n\n46\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.100\nyou then start kind of narrowing\nyour focus into the particular\n\n47\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.960\nfield that you want to move into, right?\n\n48\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.430\nSo this is gonna be a little\nbit on the general side.\n\n49\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.920\nNow each one of these domains is made up\nof a number of different topics, so for\n\n50\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.600\nexample software, right, 1.0 software.\n\n51\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.980\nIf we take a look at that one it's divided\nup into a number of different things.\n\n52\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.351\nMobile operating systems, desktop\nworkstations, software compatibility,\n\n53\n00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.542\nawareness of hardware compatibility.\n\n54\n00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:47.022\nAll of these are things we need to\nknow to keep our software running and\n\n55\n00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:49.362\noperational and\nto be able to troubleshoot and\n\n56\n00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:52.690\nfix it when it's not working\nthe way that it's supposed to.\n\n57\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.630\nThese are all topics that we need to know.\n\n58\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.430\nSo you'll see these divisions\nInside each of the domains,\n\n59\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.140\nas they kind of tailor to\nthe topics that you wanna cover.\n\n60\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.260\nBut just at a high level, software.\n\n61\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.220\nThose are the programs that\nwe run on our computer, and\n\n62\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.950\nthey're the things that we\ninteract with on a daily basis.\n\n63\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540\nFor most of us, when we use a computer\nwe don't necessarily care what hardware\n\n64\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.620\nit has, it's the software that we use.\n\n65\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.976\nThat's what we interact with,\nthat's what important to us and so\n\n66\n00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.890\nwe need to understand how that works.\n\n67\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.210\nSecond is hardware.\n\n68\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.900\nHardware is what actually powers\neverything behind the scenes.\n\n69\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.960\nThe hard drive, memory, CPU,\nall of those components.\n\n70\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.720\nAnd we don't think about them\na lot until they break and\n\n71\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.060\nthey malfunction or our system is\nrunning slow and we wanna upgrade.\n\n72\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.610\nAll of a sudden understanding what\nthat hardware is, is really important.\n\n73\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.300\nWhen you're looking at a sale and\nadvertisement in the newspaper and you see\n\n74\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.790\ntwo different computers and they're\nfour or $500 difference, why is that?\n\n75\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.530\nWhat are the components that make\none worth more than the other?\n\n76\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.970\nUnderstanding hardware is what's going\nto help you to answer that question.\n\n77\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.200\nAll right, then we've got security.\n\n78\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.490\nSecurity is really important.\n\n79\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.710\nYou'll see it's 21% of the exam.\n\n80\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.170\nIt's another one that's a fairly\nlarge category on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.530\nAnd that's because you\nsee every single week\n\n82\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.010\narticles that are being posted about\ncompanies that have been compromised.\n\n83\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.110\nWhere data has been leaked\nonto the Internet or\n\n84\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.140\nhackers have broken into a system and\nstolen credit card data.\n\n85\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.340\nThat's not good and\n\n86\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.850\na lot of it is easily avoidable if we\ntake the proper security precautions.\n\n87\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.810\nSo in the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nCertification you get\n\n88\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.380\nan introduction to security.\n\n89\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.280\nThat needs to be a fundamental, it needs\nto be a part of everything you do in\n\n90\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.080\nIT regardless of your actual job role,\nIT security is always important.\n\n91\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.060\nIn 4.0 we've got networking,\n\n92\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.750\nit's rare these days to have a computer\nthat is just standing alone by itself.\n\n93\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.880\nWe almost always have it connect\nto a network like the Internet.\n\n94\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.020\nSo how do we do that?\n\n95\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.180\nHow do we get connected to the Internet?\n\n96\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.850\nHow do we talk between two computers?\n\n97\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.090\nHow do we share a printer so\nwe don't have to buy multiple printers?\n\n98\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.060\nWe could have more than one computer\nall using the same printer.\n\n99\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110\nThat's all the basic\nfundamentals of networking.\n\n100\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.690\nAnd then lastly, IT literacy,\n\n101\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.250\nI kind of mentioned already,\nwhich is understanding the jargon.\n\n102\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.110\nIT man it is acronym soup.\n\n103\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.870\nYou have tons and\ntons of letters being thrown around and\n\n104\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.220\nsometimes they're said like letters,\nsometimes they're said like fake words.\n\n105\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.470\nYou've got scuzzy and PCI, CPU, RAM.\n\n106\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.790\nWhat do all these mean?\n\n107\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.620\nWe need to make sure we understand\nthat jargon, otherwise you just get\n\n108\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.180\nreally confused when you move\ninto the more advanced topics.\n\n109\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.590\nSo these are the things that make\nup the IT fundamentals exam and\n\n110\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.940\nyou'll see each one is very important\nregardless of whether your goal\n\n111\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.250\nis to go into systems administration,\nnetwork administration,\n\n112\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.940\nif you wanna be an IT security officer,\ngoing into management.\n\n113\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.520\nThese are topics that every one of\nus should know and be aware of.\n\n114\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.320\nAll right,\nnow when you're ready to take the exam,\n\n115\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.210\nlet's talk a little bit about\nthe actual exam itself, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.210\nThe exam is a multiple choice\nexam that's computer based.\n\n117\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.510\nYou'll actually go to\na VUE testing center,\n\n118\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.780\nPearson VUE is a company that has\ntesting centers all over the world.\n\n119\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.180\nYou'll go to one of their centers,\nyou'll sit down at a computer, and\n\n120\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.890\nyou'll take a multiple choice exam.\n\n121\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.770\nOn a positive note, that means\nyou'll get your results right away,\n\n122\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.535\nwhich is exciting.\n\n123\n00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:03.710\nSo you can go and take the test and\nget the certification all on the same day\n\n124\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.910\nhave something great right\nthere on your resume.\n\n125\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.320\nThe exam is 75 questions, so\nit's not too terribly large.\n\n126\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.420\nBut you do only have 60 minutes,\nwhich means you don't wanna mess around.\n\n127\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.400\nIf you spend 1 minute per question, well,\nyou're gonna run out of time on the exam\n\n128\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.920\nand you're not gonna get\nto the last 15 questions.\n\n129\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.290\nSo you need to know your content.\n\n130\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.640\nGet in there,\nanswer the questions, and move on.\n\n131\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.300\nThey are just multiple choice,\nthat does make it a little bit easier.\n\n132\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.495\nYou shouldn't have any problems completing\nit in the time you have allotted,\n\n133\n00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:31.140\nall right?\n\n134\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.560\nNow it is scored out of 1,000,\nyou need 650 to pass, so\n\n135\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.330\nthat's a pretty good passing mark and\nthe exam itself is $112 United States.\n\n136\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330\nAt least if you're in another country,\n\n137\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.000\nyou'll need to switch to the other pricing\nto see what that is gonna be like for you.\n\n138\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.180\nNow when you take the exam,\nyou do need to go to a VUE testing center.\n\n139\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.400\nAnd if you don't know about VUE,\n\n140\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.850\nif you haven't dealt with them before,\nyou're gonna deal with them a lot.\n\n141\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.940\nBecause CompTIA, Microsoft,\n\n142\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.430\nCISCO, all of the big computer vendors out\nthere use Pearson VUE for their testing.\n\n143\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.790\nSo to find a center near you, you just go\nto their website VUE's website is vue.com.\n\n144\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.500\nSo if you fire up your\nfavorite web browser and\n\n145\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.800\ngo to veu.com, it'll take you to the\nwebpage that I'm looking at right here.\n\n146\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.900\nAnd there's a link up in the top\nthat says for test takers.\n\n147\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.850\nAnd so\nyou can go to the test taker homepage and\n\n148\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.380\nthey'll have where you can find\nthe nearest testing center to you.\n\n149\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.050\nSo it's gonna ask me\nwhat program I'm doing.\n\n150\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.540\nI'm gonna type in CompTIA, and so there\nwe go, we've got CompTIA certifications.\n\n151\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.640\nAnd so I can see some basic information\nhere, and then we can create an account,\n\n152\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.350\nwhich you will want an account to\ntrack all of your certifications and\n\n153\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.020\nthen we can find a test center.\n\n154\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.320\nSo I'm gonna hit that link to\nfind a test center near me and\n\n155\n00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.190\nwe'll see where we can go and take a test.\n\n156\n00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.460\nSo you just put in what city you happen to\nbe in, maybe I'll say that I'm in Orlando,\n\n157\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.230\nFlorida and we'll do a search and\nit's gonna search.\n\n158\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.530\nAnd I'm in the United States, if you're\nin Europe, if you're in Asia, Australia,\n\n159\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.330\nthere's VUE testing centers there too,\nright?\n\n160\n00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.820\nSo just punch in your country,\nit'll find them.\n\n161\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.770\nAnd you can register and\n\n162\n00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.540\ntake the exam right there at\nthe one that's closest to you.\n\n163\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.370\nIf one is closed or doesn't have\na seat during the time that you want,\n\n164\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.910\nyou can pick another one, jump over\nthere and take it there too, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.390\nThe nice thing here,\nyou go to a local testing center,\n\n166\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.180\nyou take the exam, it tells you\nimmediately whether you pass or fail.\n\n167\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.580\nWhen you pass, you have the certification,\nyou put it on your resume and now you're\n\n168\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.780\nready to launch that IT career and that's\nreally what IT fundamentals is all about.\n\n169\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.330\nAll right, so what's next?\n\n170\n00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.860\nWell if this certification sounds like the\nright thing for you then jump out there,\n\n171\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.210\nget some training, and\ngo and take the exam.\n\n172\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.250\nCompTIA IT Fundamentals training\nfrom ITProTV is actually available\n\n173\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.020\nfree of charge.\n\n174\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:43.910\nYou can jump over to the itpro.tv\nwebsite at http://itpro.tv.\n\n175\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.472\nGo in there, sign up for\na free account and\n\n176\n00:08:46.472 --> 00:08:51.340\nCompTIA IT Fundamental video training\nall free of charge go and take the exam,\n\n177\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.610\nthe only thing you have to pay for\nis the exam and you get the certification.\n\n178\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.060\nNow if you're knowledge level is already\nbeyond the topics that are here,\n\n179\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.000\nsome of you might be a hobbyist\nyou've been working or helping other\n\n180\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000\npeople with computers for a long time,\nyou might wanna skip over IT fundamentals.\n\n181\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.720\nThe next one in line though is gonna\nvary based on what you wanna do.\n\n182\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.570\nIf you're looking to do desktop support,\n\n183\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.410\nthe CompTIA A+ would be\nthe next certification for you.\n\n184\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.025\nIf you're looking to do\nnetwork administration,\n\n185\n00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:17.870\nNetwork+ will be the next\ncertification for you.\n\n186\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.010\nIf you're looking to do systems\nadministrator you might jump over to some\n\n187\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.600\nof the Microsoft MTA for\nthe Windows Operating System or\n\n188\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.200\nWindows Server Operating Systems.\n\n189\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.910\nOr CompTIA Linux+ if you're\nlooking to do Linux.\n\n190\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.740\nSo you start planning for\na focus after this.\n\n191\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.330\nBut at a general level, just getting\nstarted, this is the right place for you.\n\n192\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.765\nThe IT fundamentals, jump in, take that\ncertification and start your IT career.\n\n193\n00:09:38.765 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:07,963\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:13,682\nThe first domain for\nCompTIA IT Fundamentals is 1.0 software.\n\n3\n00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,650\nAnd in this domain we cover all sorts\nof different things that deal with\n\n4\n00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,480\nthe interface that a human has with the,\nthe computer.\n\n5\n00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,610\nRight, the, the programs that we use\nto perform the jobs on our system.\n\n6\n00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,340\nEach of these are really important and\n\n7\n00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,220\nthis is the most common element\nthat people deal with on a system.\n\n8\n00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,031\nIt also accounts for 21% of the exam, so\nwe kind of want to know this one and, and\n\n9\n00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,680\nhave our good basics there.\n\n10\n00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,140\nBut it is definitely\na high-traffic area for us.\n\n11\n00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,200\nIf you go to work in the IT profession,\n\n12\n00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,530\nyou're gonna be dealing\nwith software constantly.\n\n13\n00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:45,200\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat the objectives inside of that.\n\n14\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,750\nRight, so inside of software we're gonna\ntake a look at several different things\n\n15\n00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,420\nstarting with compare and\ncontrast common operating systems and\n\n16\n00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,010\ntheir functions and features.\n\n17\n00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,600\nIt's pretty rare to find somebody\nwho doesn't have a computer at\n\n18\n00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,860\nhome these days.\n\n19\n00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,300\nBut that computer probably runs\none particular operating system,\n\n20\n00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,400\nmost commonly Microsoft Windows right,\nthat's, that's the main operating system\n\n21\n00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,050\nout there in the workplace and it's\nstill the main operating system at home.\n\n22\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,220\nBut that's not the only operating\nsystem that's out there.\n\n23\n00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,390\nSo we need to be familiar\nwith some of the other OSs.\n\n24\n00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,440\nSo that we can at least visually recognize\nto know that they're not Windows, because\n\n25\n00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,000\nall of that stuff that, you know, about\nWindows won't work in those other OSs.\n\n26\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,618\nSo we need to have that basic familiarity.\n\n27\n00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:28,580\nNow the 1.1 objective actually\nexpands even beyond that\n\n28\n00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,750\nto not just desktop operating\nsystems like Windows, Linux, Mac OS.\n\n29\n00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,210\nBut goes beyond it to mobile\noperating systems, like Apple iOS,\n\n30\n00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,590\nlike you'd have on an iPhone or an iPad or\nGoogle Android, which you'd find on,\n\n31\n00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,720\nwell Android phones or\nwhat does Blackberry run these days?\n\n32\n00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,570\nIt's QNX.\n\n33\n00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,170\nRight, so, so\nthese different operating systems that you\n\n34\n00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,500\nprobably use every single day, but don't\nthink of as a computer operating system.\n\n35\n00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,900\nBut your cell phone is a computer,\nand it's running an operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,700\nSo we need to have some basic\nfamiliarity with each of those.\n\n37\n00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,790\n>> In our second objective,\n\n38\n00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,830\nwe take a look at identifying common\nprograms, applications and their purpose.\n\n39\n00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,040\nNow, this is more than likely\nwhat most users think about\n\n40\n00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,820\nwhen they run their computer.\n\n41\n00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,590\nI can't tell you how many times\npeople said the only thing\n\n42\n00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,820\nI use on my computer is, is Excel.\n\n43\n00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,110\nI don't use anything else.\n\n44\n00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,860\nI just use Excel.\n\n45\n00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,520\nAnd then when you ask them\nabout the web browser,\n\n46\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,990\nthey go well, that's the Internet.\n\n47\n00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,855\nI don't use the Internet.\n\n48\n00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,300\n[LAUGH] But or, or\nthey don't use that regularly.\n\n49\n00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,030\nSo, so for them, they're really\nfocusing in on particular programs.\n\n50\n00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,950\nWell we wanna make\n\n51\n00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,380\nsure that you understand that there are\ndifferent programs for different purposes.\n\n52\n00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,320\nWe're gonna talk about things like,\nlike just some,\n\n53\n00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,190\nsome different ones like word processors\nand, and then other productivity apps and\n\n54\n00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,150\nsome different ones too.\n\n55\n00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,170\nBut it's just making sure that we\nunderstand that there are gonna be\n\n56\n00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,690\ndifferent applications for different\npurposes, and a lot of times remember,\n\n57\n00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,390\nusers are only thinking that,\nthat's the only thing the computer does.\n\n58\n00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,715\nWe want to make sure that we as IT\nprofessionals are gonna be able to help\n\n59\n00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,470\nthem, and let them know that there\nare different applications for everything.\n\n60\n00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,280\n>> Now in the first two objectives,\nwe were covering content that a lot of you\n\n61\n00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,880\nwill know just from using your own\nhome computer or personal computer.\n\n62\n00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,570\nBut in the third objective,\n\n63\n00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,590\ngiven a scenario use software\nmanagement best practices.\n\n64\n00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,880\nNow, we're starting to move\nmore into the business world.\n\n65\n00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,440\nIn the business world, we have to\ncontrol how people install software,\n\n66\n00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,880\nhow we remove software, how we manage it.\n\n67\n00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,600\nBecause a lot of that\nsoftware has a license.\n\n68\n00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,180\nThere's a dollar value associated with it.\n\n69\n00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,680\nAnd so, we've gotta have some\nbasic best practices in place\n\n70\n00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,049\nto ensure that we're\nproperly handling that.\n\n71\n00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,250\n>> In our fourth objective,\nwe're taking a look at identifying\n\n72\n00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,370\ndifferent alternative technologies and\ntheir purpose.\n\n73\n00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,930\nThis is where it becomes a little bit more\nremoved, and with the things that we're\n\n74\n00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,310\nnormally going to be associating with\nevery day of, of people using computers.\n\n75\n00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,790\nThese are gonna be things that we see\nrunning in the background that you and\n\n76\n00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,920\nI may not know about, but we're gonna at\nleast learn about them a little bit more.\n\n77\n00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,204\nSo we'll, we'll talk about some\nof the different technology and\n\n78\n00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,730\nsome buzz words that\nyou may hear out there.\n\n79\n00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,175\nSuch as the term virtualization, and\n\n80\n00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,758\nwe'll get deeper into that,\nwhen we go into that particular area.\n\n81\n00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,030\n>> Hm.\n\n82\n00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,980\nAnd then for the final part of\nthe software domain, we're gonna tackle,\n\n83\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,660\nexplain the basic software features and\nfunctions of wireless devices.\n\n84\n00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,620\nAnd you, it used to be that wireless made\nup a small portion of the computing world,\n\n85\n00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,990\nbut today, it's actually in the majority\nand more people use laptops than desktops,\n\n86\n00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,850\nand mobile phones and\ntablets are, are commonplace.\n\n87\n00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,070\nAnd so we need to understand some of the\ndifferences with wireless computing than\n\n88\n00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,130\nwhat we would have with a wired device.\n\n89\n00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,560\nAll five of those objectives come\ntogether to form up the software domain.\n\n90\n00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,290\nIt's great information to know.\n\n91\n00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,688\nWe basically cover all those different\nconcepts to get you at that basic,\n\n92\n00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:41,510\nwell-rounded, foundational knowledge.\n\n93\n00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,212\nRight.\n\n94\n00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:46,340\nAs a user, like a home user or even in a,\na business, a lot of times you get a,\n\n95\n00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,000\na pigeonholed or\na tunnel vision view of software.\n\n96\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,740\nYou use just what you need for your job or\njust what you like to use at home.\n\n97\n00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,500\nBut there's a lot of other stuff that\nwe need to be familiar with because\n\n98\n00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,980\nnot everyone uses a computer\nthe same way that you do.\n\n99\n00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,450\nAll right, so that basically\nmakes up the software domain.\n\n100\n00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,270\nStay tuned,\nwe're gonna jump into our episodes next.\n\n101\n00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,399\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:39,940\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,200\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back today or,\n\n7\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600\nstarting out today cuz our\nfirst episode with Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,290\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,330\n>> It is going well today,\n\n10\n00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,210\nwe are, are getting ready to\nstart our brand new series.\n\n11\n00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,100\nCan't be more excited than that because\nwe get to try something new, and\n\n12\n00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,153\nsomething that we,\nwe both actually kind of mastered already.\n\n13\n00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,624\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is pretty cool, you know?\n\n14\n00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,510\n>> Yeah, well,\nyou've gotta start somewhere.\n\n15\n00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,971\n>> Yep.\n>> And so in CompTIA IT finals that's\n\n16\n00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:03,102\nexactly what we're doing.\n\n17\n00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,890\nWe're gonna start out, exam objective 1.1.\n\n18\n00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,390\nWhich is Compare and\nContrast Common Operating Systems and\n\n19\n00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,580\ntheir Functions and Features.\n\n20\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,624\nWhich is just a,\na really long way of saying.\n\n21\n00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,180\nBut that there is more than one\noperating system out there and\n\n22\n00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,090\nwe should at least be basically\nfamiliar with each one.\n\n23\n00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,940\nNow before we dive into\nthe different ones,\n\n24\n00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,970\nlet's start out at even higher level.\n\n25\n00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,940\nWhat is an Operating System?\n\n26\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,997\nWell, when you buy a computer or,\nyou know, a laptop, a desktop,\n\n27\n00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:30,973\nit doesn't matter.\n\n28\n00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,720\nYou're buying hardware.\n\n29\n00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,660\nAnd the hardware by itself\ndoesn't do anything.\n\n30\n00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,140\nWe have to tell the hardware\nto do something.\n\n31\n00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,180\nBut no matter how much you\nyell at that hardware,\n\n32\n00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,910\nits not actually gonna do anything.\n\n33\n00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,020\nYou need an interpreter.\n\n34\n00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,280\nSomebody to sit in between you and\nthe hardware.\n\n35\n00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,060\nAnd that thing is the Operating System.\n\n36\n00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,620\nThe operating system is what allows you\nto communicate with the hardware and\n\n37\n00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,990\nget it to do what you want it to do.\n\n38\n00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,140\nSo if you're gonna be typing\na letter on that keyboard,\n\n39\n00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,540\nthe operating system is seeing\nyou pressing these keys and\n\n40\n00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,340\nturning that into letters\nthat appear on the screen.\n\n41\n00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,900\nIt's that basic interaction\nbetween human and computer.\n\n42\n00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,450\nYour operating system is\nwhat powers all of that.\n\n43\n00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,710\n>> And most of us, when we sit down,\n\n44\n00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,520\nwe think that if we haven't really got\ntechnical experience with the computer.\n\n45\n00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040\nWe just think the computer\nmagically turns on.\n\n46\n00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,750\nAnd that when we do typing, or we go and\nbrowse the internet, it just connects, and\n\n47\n00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,250\nwe don't worry about it.\n\n48\n00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,480\nBut remember that there's layers.\n\n49\n00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200\nWe have hardware and then we have the,\nthe operating system or\n\n50\n00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,750\nthe software itself that makes\nthe hardware do what we want to do.\n\n51\n00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,150\nWithout that, we can,\ncan do whatever we want to,\n\n52\n00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,800\nthe hardware is just gonna sit there.\n\n53\n00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,305\nNow, now Don I,\nI made a little drawing for us.\n\n54\n00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:39,900\n>> Oh.\n\n55\n00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,720\n>> So, so that we could,\ncould understand this a little bit better.\n\n56\n00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,550\n>> All right.\n\n57\n00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,270\n>> So, so here it is.\n\n58\n00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,880\nNow if we have,\nwithout an operating system,\n\n59\n00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,660\nall you really do have is just a computer.\n\n60\n00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,340\nAnd it can be connected to\nas many devices as you want,\n\n61\n00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,240\nthey're still not gonna communicate.\n\n62\n00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,660\nSo you could have your, your entire\ncomputer connected to a, a, a printer,\n\n63\n00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,910\nto a scanner, to whatever,\nit's not gonna do what we want it to do.\n\n64\n00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,670\nSame thing,\neven if I have applications sitting there.\n\n65\n00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,351\nSo, so I made some,\nsome weird applications.\n\n66\n00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, like Super Zim Zombie Zombie\n\n67\n00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:18,570\nhere and, of course,\na text editor and, and even a game.\n\n68\n00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,590\nGames, text editors or, or\nother things that we have and we buy them.\n\n69\n00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,920\nIf we don't have a place to actually\nput them, they're not gonna work.\n\n70\n00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,520\nSo the operating system\nhelps us out there too.\n\n71\n00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,830\nAnd then of course the main one.\n\n72\n00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,050\nThat's you and me,\npeople that need to be able to do things.\n\n73\n00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,087\nIf we cannot get to,\n\n74\n00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:39,752\nto be able to communicate with\nthe hardware that we need, it really is.\n\n75\n00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,894\nIt's a, a bad thing,\n\n76\n00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:45,750\nbecause then the computer does whatever it\nwants to do instead doing what we want to.\n\n77\n00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,700\nSo it really is like a miss translation or\na lost in translation type of idea.\n\n78\n00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,490\nSo all of us, all together, we do need\nan operating system to make this work.\n\n79\n00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,040\nAnd so this is the most\nfoundational level of software,\n\n80\n00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,940\nthat on any system whether we're\ntalking about a, a computer PC,\n\n81\n00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,690\nor a mobile device such as a,\na phone, or even tablets.\n\n82\n00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,920\nThey all have different operating systems.\n\n83\n00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,160\nWe wanna make sure that,\nthat we're fairly comfortable and\n\n84\n00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,620\nfamiliar with the major ones\nthat we come into contact with.\n\n85\n00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,380\n>> And now, when you buy a new piece\nof hardware, desktop, laptop, whatever.\n\n86\n00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,240\nWhen you buy that hardware it will\ntypically come with an operating\n\n87\n00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,700\nsystem running on it.\n\n88\n00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,440\nAnd in some cases, you can't change it.\n\n89\n00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,800\nIt comes with an operating system,\nthat's what you have to run.\n\n90\n00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,050\nIn other cases though,\nyou may be able to change it.\n\n91\n00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,600\nYou might have hardware that's capable of\nrunning more than one operating system.\n\n92\n00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,270\nAnd so while you might have bought\nit with one OS, you know, which is,\n\n93\n00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,510\nis how we commonly\nabbreviate operating system.\n\n94\n00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,150\nYou could actually swap it out for\n\n95\n00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,080\na different OS and\nthat's entirely up to you.\n\n96\n00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,340\nSome OSs are free.\n\n97\n00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,440\nSome cost money.\n\n98\n00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,400\nBut it, it's up to you to pick which one\nyou like and load it on your hardware.\n\n99\n00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640\nIt's not always possible.\n\n100\n00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,790\nSome of them are, are hard set.\n\n101\n00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,900\nAnd where you really see\nthe line drawn on this is\n\n102\n00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,420\nwhen we talk about the different\nkind of divisions in hardware.\n\n103\n00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,690\nThat right now,\nwe really see mobile hardware.\n\n104\n00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,540\nThings that you're using in\nlike cellphones and tablets.\n\n105\n00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,160\nAnd in those cases you typically\ncannot change the operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,520\nAnd then there's the other\nside which are workstations.\n\n107\n00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,900\nYour desktops and laptops.\n\n108\n00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,520\nAnd on those you usually can\nchange your operating system.\n\n109\n00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,660\nSo, when you know what OS are out\nthere to determine whether that's even\n\n110\n00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,484\nsomething we should consider.\n\n111\n00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,470\n>> Right.\n\n112\n00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,520\n>> For most people it isn't.\n\n113\n00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,825\nMost people, you want to use the operating\nsystem that came with your hardware.\n\n114\n00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:34,360\n>> Yeah, the great thing about using\nthe operating system that came with\n\n115\n00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,670\nthe hardware is, we know that it works.\n\n116\n00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,270\nWe don't have to guess if it works.\n\n117\n00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,533\nUsually if a company a manufacturer,\ngoes in and says, hey,\n\n118\n00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,270\nwe want this operating\nsystem running with it.\n\n119\n00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,470\nThey've gone ahead and they've made\nsure that it will work with theirs,\n\n120\n00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,070\ninstead of you trying to guess whether or\nnot, you know, it's actually going\n\n121\n00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,100\nto work if you go ahead and buy your own\noperating system and put it on there.\n\n122\n00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,320\nThere are ways you can do that.\n\n123\n00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,210\nBut it takes a little bit more\nresearch and then you have to again,\n\n124\n00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,480\njust try and\nfigure out once you get it on there.\n\n125\n00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,120\nIs everything working\nthe way it needs to be?\n\n126\n00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,311\n>> Yeah.\nAll right.\n\n127\n00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,581\nSo let's talk about some of\nthe different OSs that are out there.\n\n128\n00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:07,320\nRight?\n\n129\n00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,130\nWhat I want to do is give you\nguys just a quick little tour.\n\n130\n00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,865\nI've got four of the, the,\nthe really most popular OSs.\n\n131\n00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:16,310\nI think I have five of them don't I?\n\n132\n00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,276\nIf I count my own laptop.\n\n133\n00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,480\nSo I've got really the most popular\noperating systems fired up here.\n\n134\n00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,310\nSo I can just kinda show you and\nwe don't wanna go crazy about it,\n\n135\n00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,970\nwere not learning\nthe operating systems here.\n\n136\n00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,460\nWe just need to be able to understand\nthe differences between them and\n\n137\n00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,300\nkinda what their purpose is.\n\n138\n00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,080\nRight?\nThat's, that's kinda key.\n\n139\n00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,900\nSo let's start,\nwe'll do like the objectives do.\n\n140\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,150\nThe objectives start with those\nmobile operating systems.\n\n141\n00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,880\nNow, mobile operating systems are what\nyou'll typically find on cellphones, or,\n\n142\n00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,370\nor smart phones, and tablets.\n\n143\n00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,620\nSo, tablet computing is, is here to stay.\n\n144\n00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,390\nRight?\nIt, it's\n\n145\n00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,890\nreally gained in popularity\nin the last few years.\n\n146\n00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,915\nAnd you'll find that tablets and\n\n147\n00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,520\ncellphones typically\nshare operating systems.\n\n148\n00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,990\nSo, if there's an operating\nsystem designed for a phone,\n\n149\n00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,790\nit'll normally run on a tablet and,\nand vice versa.\n\n150\n00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,510\nFirst tablets really just a big cellphone.\n\n151\n00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,762\nMaybe with or without cellphone service.\n\n152\n00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,060\nRight?\nIt depends on the hardware you buy.\n\n153\n00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,700\nAll right.\nSo the four most common ones,\n\n154\n00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,260\nthe ones that, that CompTIA calls\nout in the objectives are Apple iOS,\n\n155\n00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,018\nAndroid, Windows Phone, and Blackberry.\n\n156\n00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,330\nAll right.\n\n157\n00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,610\nEach of these are different\noperating systems.\n\n158\n00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,030\nAnd I know the naming convention\ncan be a little different for each.\n\n159\n00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,145\nSo we'll just start with Apple.\n\n160\n00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:21,940\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,050\nSo, Apple iOS, that's the iPhone\nOperating System, is what that stands for.\n\n162\n00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,200\nBecause it was originally designed for\nthe iPhone, they added the iPad later,\n\n163\n00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,530\nwhich were their tablets and\nthe iPad runs iOS also.\n\n164\n00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,560\nSo it's not just the iPhone\nanymore now it's iPad too.\n\n165\n00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280\nAnd that operating system is proprietary.\n\n166\n00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000\nIt's developed by Apple for Apple.\n\n167\n00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,060\nSo you can only run it on Apple hardware.\n\n168\n00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,840\nSo if you go to Apple's website and you\nbuy something or you go to your cellphone\n\n169\n00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,450\nprovider and buy an Apple product there,\nit'll come with the iOS on it.\n\n170\n00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,184\nYou cannot buy the iOS separately.\n\n171\n00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,609\nSo if you have a, a phone from a different\nmanufacturer, you can't load it on there.\n\n172\n00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,485\nSo if you want the iOS.\n\n173\n00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,372\nYou've gotta buy an Apple product.\n\n174\n00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,201\nIt's theirs, theirs privately.\n\n175\n00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,120\n>> Yeah, but once you have an iOS, you\ndon't really need anything else, do you?\n\n176\n00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,875\n>> Well, not according to them.\n\n177\n00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:15,450\n[LAUGH] You know, their, their motto\nis that their, their stuff just works.\n\n178\n00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,506\nAnd so, a lot of people love that.\n\n179\n00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,300\nThey love the idead that they can\nget a device that they don't have to\n\n180\n00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,390\nworry about the nuts and bolts behind it.\n\n181\n00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,940\nBut there's pros and cons with that which,\ndo we want to get into that now, or\n\n182\n00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,520\ncover that in like, big comparison?\n\n183\n00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,580\n>> Let's cover that in a comparison.\n\n184\n00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,120\n>> Okay, all right, so\nwe'll hold off on that.\n\n185\n00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,560\nBut with each of these,\nthere's pros and cons, right?\n\n186\n00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,140\nSo, so keep that in mind.\n\n187\n00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,020\nBut the Apple iOS, let me,\nlet me bring it up here, real quick.\n\n188\n00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,970\nGot it kicking around.\n\n189\n00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,860\nHere we go.\n\n190\n00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,110\nNope, nope, that would be Android.\n\n191\n00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,080\nLet me get my, my devices straight.\n\n192\n00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,500\nYou know, we can do a side by side.\n\n193\n00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,610\n>> Yeah, that'll work.\n>> I'm gonna go crazy.\n\n194\n00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,770\nOn the left side here, I have iOS, right?\n\n195\n00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,980\nSo, this is the iPhone operating\nsystem that you would get on a,\n\n196\n00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,450\non an Apple device.\n\n197\n00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,370\nNow, I've got it set up\nhere as a cellphone.\n\n198\n00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,850\nSo, it's displayed in that\nkind of vertical manner.\n\n199\n00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,350\nIf this were a tablet, it would be a much\nbigger screen spread kind of wide.\n\n200\n00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,060\nBut it's the same operating system.\n\n201\n00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,910\nAndroid is the second one that\nCompTIA mentions right here.\n\n202\n00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,890\nAnd with Android,\nthat is similar to iOS, but\n\n203\n00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,360\ninstead of being from Apple,\nthis one's from Google, right?\n\n204\n00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,240\nSo, Google created the Android operating\nsystem, and if you ask them, they'll say,\n\n205\n00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720\nwe didn't create Androids.\n\n206\n00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,310\nIt's open.\n\n207\n00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,930\nEverybody creates Androids.\n\n208\n00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,020\nBut, it is really from Google.\n\n209\n00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,640\nAnd they designed it to be a, originally\nto be like a royalty free operating\n\n210\n00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,400\nsystem that any manufacturer could use.\n\n211\n00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,170\nSo, if HTC or Samsung,\nor Motorola or whoever\n\n212\n00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,350\nwants to create a cell phone, They don't\nhave to write their own operating system.\n\n213\n00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,100\nThey can just go to google and\nget Android.\n\n214\n00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,100\nAdd drivers for their hardware,\nand up it goes.\n\n215\n00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,860\nSo whenever you go to a cellphone store,\nyou go to Best Buy or\n\n216\n00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,090\nwhatever electronic stores\nin your neighborhood,\n\n217\n00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,150\nyou can find tablets from a wide variety\nof manufacturers, all running Android.\n\n218\n00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,640\nOr, cellphones, from multiple carriers,\nall running Android.\n\n219\n00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,520\nVersus iOS which would just be Apple.\n\n220\n00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,670\nBut, at the end of the day, they\nactually do work pretty much the same.\n\n221\n00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,480\nThey give you a very simple user\ninterface designed to be touched, right?\n\n222\n00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,590\nYou use your just a finger to tap things,\nright?\n\n223\n00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,720\nNo file structure or command line here.\n\n224\n00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,400\nYou just tap icons.\n\n225\n00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,650\nSo, if I'm on my iPhone and I want to go\ninto my health app, I just click on it.\n\n226\n00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,154\nAnd then, I get into here on my dashboard,\nand I can start to log entries and, and\n\n227\n00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,604\nall the other good stuff that we,\nyou know,\n\n228\n00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,260\nthat we need to log on our system, right?\n\n229\n00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,520\nSo, cuz, you know, we definitely\nwant to track our, our health.\n\n230\n00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,220\nAnd then,\nwe can go into our other various settings.\n\n231\n00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,960\nWe can fire up our web browser and\nactually,\n\n232\n00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,160\nI don't know if this one's\nconnected to the internet.\n\n233\n00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,910\nI guess we can find out.\n\n234\n00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,770\nLet's see if we can get\nto the IT Pro Tv site.\n\n235\n00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,980\nSo, we can browse the web.\n\n236\n00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,900\nWe can check our email.\n\n237\n00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,340\nWe can misspell our website.\n\n238\n00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,650\nThat's always a fun one.\n\n239\n00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,670\nThere we go.\n\n240\n00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,510\nSo, we can browse the web.\n\n241\n00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,440\nWe can answer our emails,\nsend text messages, make phone calls,\n\n242\n00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,860\nall those other various\nthings on a cell phone.\n\n243\n00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,860\nNow, a mobile OS like this is\noptimized for battery life and\n\n244\n00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,640\nsmall screens, versus some of the other\nOS's we'll see later that are designed for\n\n245\n00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,430\nbigger screens, and, and\nnot so much battery life.\n\n246\n00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,370\nBut, but that one right there,\nthat is the iOS.\n\n247\n00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,070\nAndroid, on the other hand, well,\nit's not really the other hand.\n\n248\n00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,410\nIt's basically the same.\n\n249\n00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,410\nIt looks different, right?\n\n250\n00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,360\nGraphically they put different elements\nin like the Google search bar right here,\n\n251\n00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,276\nthat we can go in and search the internet.\n\n252\n00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:25,530\nWe can do our cameras, email,\ntext messaging, all the various things.\n\n253\n00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,700\nIf I want to fire up my web browser here,\nI can do that.\n\n254\n00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,460\nAnd, I can go to ITPro.tv, and\nwe'll browse out to the internet.\n\n255\n00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,843\nAnd, there's the ITPro.tv website.\n\n256\n00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:34,480\nRight?\n\n257\n00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,140\nSo, we can go in here, view a website and\ndo whatever it is that we need.\n\n258\n00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,390\nSo, mobile operating systems are just\nbeing optimized for that type of hardware,\n\n259\n00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,580\na different type of hardware then\nwhat we normally have in the desktop.\n\n260\n00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,080\nRight?\n\n261\n00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,460\nNow, CompTIA does call out\ntwo more of these OSs.\n\n262\n00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,110\nYou'll see, actually get, I was\ntrying to get back to my home screen.\n\n263\n00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,330\nThere we go.\n\n264\n00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,770\nSo, they do call it two other mobile OSs,\nthe Windows phone and Blackberry, right?\n\n265\n00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,100\nThese are the two smaller players\nin the mobile OS market, right?\n\n266\n00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,870\nWindows phone is from Microsoft.\n\n267\n00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,760\nSo, Microsoft has the,\n\n268\n00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,660\nthe Windows phone operating system, and,\nyou know, they, they just acquired Nokia.\n\n269\n00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,840\nSo if you get a Nokia phone,\nthe Nokia Lumina\n\n270\n00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,610\nline is now the Microsoft Lumina line,\nand it comes with Windows phone.\n\n271\n00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,770\nIt's designed to better\nintegrate with Windows.\n\n272\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,930\nBut, it's not terribly popular.\n\n273\n00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,250\nI think the last time I,\nI looked, it was at.\n\n274\n00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,840\nWas it at 6% of the mobile market?\n\n275\n00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,510\nDo you remember, Ronnie?\n\n276\n00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,240\n>> It's not even at 6%, even as a 2014-\n>> Oh, no.\n\n277\n00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,980\n>> Now.\n\n278\n00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,590\n>> What's it at now?\n\n279\n00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,490\n>> It's at like 3.7.\n\n280\n00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,220\n>> Oof, yeah.\n\n281\n00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,570\n>> It's, it's dropping.\n\n282\n00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,440\n>> Yeah, they are not winning that war.\n\n283\n00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,210\nSo, it's from Microsoft.\n\n284\n00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,210\nIt's got a clout behind it, right?\n\n285\n00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,700\nA, a lot of push, but\nit just hasn't been adopted widely.\n\n286\n00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,318\nAnd, and there's various reasons for\nthat, but it is another operating system.\n\n287\n00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,470\nIt's out there.\n\n288\n00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,900\nAnd then the last one is Blackberry.\n\n289\n00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,700\nNow, Blackberry, and the Blackberry OS is\nsomething that's been around a long time.\n\n290\n00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,780\nThese guys were the ones\nwho pioneered smart phones.\n\n291\n00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,950\nWhen you got a smart phone back in\nthe 90's, it, it came from Blackberry.\n\n292\n00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,230\nIt probably wasn't a phone, right.\n\n293\n00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,170\nThey didn't combine the smart phone\nidea with an actual cell phone until\n\n294\n00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,370\nright around 2000.\n\n295\n00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,330\nBut, Blackberry spearheaded that.\n\n296\n00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,890\nAnd from 2000 until,\nprobably like 2007, you know,\n\n297\n00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,610\nwhen the original iPhone came out.\n\n298\n00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,290\nDuring that time, businesses,\npeople, Blackberries were king.\n\n299\n00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,110\nThat was the phone.\n\n300\n00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,230\nAnd, they ran their own proprietary\noperating system called Blackberry OS.\n\n301\n00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,360\nWell, it worked much like the other ones.\n\n302\n00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,760\nExcept it wasn't optimized for\n\n303\n00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,080\ntouch because touch screens\nweren't popular back then.\n\n304\n00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,250\nThey had scroll wheels.\n\n305\n00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,960\nAnd so, you'd, you'd use this little wheel\nto move around and, and click on things.\n\n306\n00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,200\nWell, they started losing\nmarket share very fast.\n\n307\n00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,420\nNow, they are just a,\na shadow of what they used to be.\n\n308\n00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,600\nYou know, very, very low market share.\n\n309\n00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,490\nThey've actually dropped below Windows\nphone now, which is really sad,\n\n310\n00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,800\ncuz they, they were a very large company.\n\n311\n00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,960\nAnd, they had a great product for\nbusinesses.\n\n312\n00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,450\nThey gave you a lot of management\ntools that nobody else did, but\n\n313\n00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,190\nthe problem is other people do that now.\n\n314\n00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,690\nAnd, they didn't introduce anything new,\nand\n\n315\n00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,320\nthey were really slow to jump\non the app train, right?\n\n316\n00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,950\nYou know,\nit used to be when you had a phone,\n\n317\n00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,745\nyou made phone calls, believe it or not.\n\n318\n00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:11,240\nRight? [CROSSTALK] It's just craziness.\n>> Yeah.\n\n319\n00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,252\n>> And then,\npeople added email and texting.\n\n320\n00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,140\nAll right, fine.\n\n321\n00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,500\nSo, so phone vendors kept up with that.\n\n322\n00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,560\nBut with smartphones, applications.\n\n323\n00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,260\nAngry Birds came along, right?\n\n324\n00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,530\nNow, people wanted to play\nAngry Birds on their phone.\n\n325\n00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,170\nAnd Apple, you know, they didn't get on it\nright away, but then they said, all right.\n\n326\n00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,062\nWell, we're gonna embrace this.\n\n327\n00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:29,560\nAnd, they did, and they got a ton of apps.\n\n328\n00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,771\nAnd Android, same thing,\nbig apps App store.\n\n329\n00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,885\nBlackberry, you know,\nthey said, well, yeah,\n\n330\n00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:37,635\nwe'll make a, we can do apps, but\nwe don't want to focus on that.\n\n331\n00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:41,185\nAnd, when people said, all right,\nboth phones can make a call.\n\n332\n00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:44,077\nBoth phones can send text messages\nanad email, but on this one,\n\n333\n00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,267\nI can play Angry Birds.\n\n334\n00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,266\nI, I shouldn't, like, compartmentalize\nit to just that one program, but it's,\n\n335\n00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,447\nit's kind of true.\n\n336\n00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:52,237\nThat, that people say, well, I,\nI'll go with this other phone.\n\n337\n00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,057\nAnd it's, and it's fancier,\nit looks pretty, right?\n\n338\n00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:57,640\nAnd, and that's what happened,\nand Backberry didn't stop it.\n\n339\n00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,810\nAnd so, yeah, they,\nthey've really kind of dwindled.\n\n340\n00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,798\nSo, those last two, Windows Phone and\nBlackberry, you just don't see very much.\n\n341\n00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:06,100\nBut, just like iOS and\n\n342\n00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,617\nAndroid, they're just operating systems\nthat are optimized for a mobile interface.\n\n343\n00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,775\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,565\nNow, there are pros and\ncons for the different OSs.\n\n345\n00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,285\nRight?\nAnd Ron, you've\n\n346\n00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,765\ngot a good comparison of these, don't you.\n\n347\n00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:21,035\n>> Yeah, I have a chart that I've\nkinda made so that we can see what,\n\n348\n00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,705\nwhat some of the comparisons are.\n\n349\n00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,205\nSo, we already know about the companies\nand, and who developed them.\n\n350\n00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:28,885\nIf you haven't seen this term, OHA,\nit's the Open Hardware Alliance.\n\n351\n00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,135\nThat's what, what Google is saying,\n\n352\n00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,035\nis that there is a bunch of\ncompanies that came together.\n\n353\n00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:34,500\nIt's not just Google by themselves.\n\n354\n00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,280\nSo you tend to see that,\nand then, of course,\n\n355\n00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,210\nthose companies and the basic operating\nsystem families that they come from.\n\n356\n00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,600\nSo, notice that iOS is\ndeveloped off of Unix.\n\n357\n00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,820\nAnd then, of course, Android is really,\nan, a Linux development.\n\n358\n00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,550\nAnd, Windows Phone really comes from the,\n\n359\n00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,740\nthe older Windows MT, ba, operating\nsystem architecture that we have.\n\n360\n00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,992\nAnd, there's that QNX\nthat we were mentioning.\n\n361\n00:15:56,992 --> 00:16:01,650\nThe differences that we tend to have\nreally happens to be where these\n\n362\n00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,684\nmobile devices get the applications from.\n\n363\n00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:07,043\nAnd how they actually\nget things like updates.\n\n364\n00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:09,730\nThey call them package managers.\n\n365\n00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,490\nToo.\nSo\n\n366\n00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,040\nhere in Apple iOS is where you connect\neverything from Apple in iTunes.\n\n367\n00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,700\nIt becomes a very pervasive platform for\n\n368\n00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,480\nyou to get anything that ever\ncomes from from Apple iOS.\n\n369\n00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,898\nAnd Android it stand, APK that from\nAndroid Package, package, something, yeah.\n\n370\n00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,311\n>> Something, yeah.\n>> I don't remember what that stands for,\n\n371\n00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:32,334\nbut you know, Android, you had the,\nthe Android app store, or the, I'm sorry,\n\n372\n00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:33,730\nit is the Google Play store.\n\n373\n00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,690\nLet me use the, the right one,\nwhere you can buy apps,\n\n374\n00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,030\nsure just, just like iTunes,\nor whatever, for, for Apple.\n\n375\n00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,980\nBut you can go and\ninstall your own applications,\n\n376\n00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,760\nif you want, without it, and\nthey're just in a APK format.\n\n377\n00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,640\nWe didn't mention it, but in Apple iOS,\n\n378\n00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,740\nthat iTunes format Is an IPA\nformat is what they call it.\n\n379\n00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,750\nAnd it, it just has to be digitally signed\nand from Apple to, to be able to install.\n\n380\n00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,500\n>> And then the Windows phone, this,\nthis is where they, they fall be,\n\n381\n00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,840\nbelow everything else\n>> Whereas you have in the App Store and\n\n382\n00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,240\nthe Google Play store millions of apps,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n383\n00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,710\n>> When you come down to Windows, they,\n\n384\n00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,700\nthey really have maybe a little\nunder a million apps and, and\n\n385\n00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,940\neven most of those aren't, aren't really,\nexciting or great for anything.\n\n386\n00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,890\n>> The, I, I shouldn't say.\n\n387\n00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,290\nThey're, they're probably good for, for\n\n388\n00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,840\nwhat Apple, Windows Phones do,\nbut overall, though, there's,\n\n389\n00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,180\nthere's really not anything that you\nwouldn't go, okay, why not get an Android?\n\n390\n00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,550\nWhy not get an iPhone to be able to do.\n\n391\n00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,560\nAnd then Blackberry.\n\n392\n00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,890\nThis is, this is the first time I,\n\n393\n00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,040\nI knew about this where they had\nchanged this to called Blackberry link.\n\n394\n00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,650\nAnd then their store,\nit's called Blackberry World.\n\n395\n00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,730\nSo the, they have had to mimic the other\nstores to, to kind of keep up and\n\n396\n00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,150\nto kind of compete.\n\n397\n00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,975\nThey've really dropped below the,\nthe one percent in the market share.\n\n398\n00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:48,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So,\n\n399\n00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,900\nthey're apps are, are probably not as\nwell developed as they, they once were.\n\n400\n00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,420\n>> Yeah, the, the challenge here is,\n\n401\n00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,770\nlet, let's say that you are a,\nan app developer.\n\n402\n00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,300\nSo, you're somebody who has\nthe skills to create an app.\n\n403\n00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,390\n>> And you see I have got an idea,\n\n404\n00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,760\nI've got this app that I\nknow everybody's gonna want.\n\n405\n00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,620\nI wanna develop it, all right?\n\n406\n00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,590\nWell, if you wanna make money, you need to\nfigure out which market is the biggest.\n\n407\n00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,640\nYou need to cater to the largest\nmarket to be successful.\n\n408\n00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,000\nSo if you develop an Apple app right,\nfor iOS.\n\n409\n00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,040\nYou will be able to,to target millions of\nApple customers across the world right,uh,\n\n410\n00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,880\nhundreds of, of millions really there\nare lot of Apple devices out there.\n\n411\n00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,570\nAnd you'll be able to sell that app.\n\n412\n00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,290\nAnd reach a large market.\n\n413\n00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,580\nAndroid, same thing.\n\n414\n00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,960\nThe, the Android market's actually\na little bit larger than Apple.\n\n415\n00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,850\nBecause of all the vendors\nthat are involved.\n\n416\n00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,610\nSo if you write an app for Android.\n\n417\n00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,460\nThere are tons of people\nout there that can use it.\n\n418\n00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,870\nBut when you write an app for\nWindows phone or Blackberry.\n\n419\n00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,420\nTheir market share is so small, right?\n\n420\n00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,670\nCombined the two are under ten\npercent of the market share.\n\n421\n00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,200\nSo if you write an app for Windows\nphone and Blackberry, at a maximum,\n\n422\n00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,630\none out of ten mobile users\nwill be able to use your app.\n\n423\n00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,570\nAnd so you've immediately cut\nout 90% of your target audience.\n\n424\n00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,640\nAnd that's what developers think about.\n\n425\n00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,360\nThey say, well,\nI'm gonna develop for Apple first.\n\n426\n00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200\nBecause I know those\nguys like to spend money.\n\n427\n00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,750\nThat, it its a known thing.\n\n428\n00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,470\nApple users tend to spend\nmore money on apps.\n\n429\n00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,950\nThen they say well I need\nto support Android second,\n\n430\n00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,030\nbecause there's more Android phones\nout there then there are Apple.\n\n431\n00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,220\nSo I get a bigger market and Android\nusers don't like to spend as much money,\n\n432\n00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,490\nbut there's a lot of them so\nthey can compensate for that.\n\n433\n00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,470\nAnd then as an afterthought, a developer\nwill say, all right well I got those and\n\n434\n00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,360\nif its easy I might do Windows Phone and\nBlackberry, and but\n\n435\n00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,210\nif its hard I probably won't.\n\n436\n00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,930\nAnd you see a lot of developers don't\nport their apps over to Windows Phone and\n\n437\n00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,300\nBlackberry, so there may be\nsome app that you really want.\n\n438\n00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,350\nAnd it's just not available on\nWindows phone and Blackberry.\n\n439\n00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,000\nAnd that's,\nthat's wearing those systems down.\n\n440\n00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,500\nHm.\n\n441\n00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,240\nAll right.\nLet's talk about the CPUs Ronnie.\n\n442\n00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,000\nAll right.\n\n443\n00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,710\n>> Yeah.\nIn the CPU support side,\n\n444\n00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,710\nyou'll actually end up seeing.\n\n445\n00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,330\nThat really all of them support ARM\narchitecture ,uh, in their processors.\n\n446\n00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:05,000\nAnd these are, are,\nrelatively high speed CPUs but\n\n447\n00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,090\ndesigned really for lightweight use.\n\n448\n00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,630\nSo they're not designed for\nheavy processing.\n\n449\n00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,630\nANd just about everybody ends up doing it.\n\n450\n00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,760\nWhether your talking about Apple IOS,\nAndroid, or Windows Phone,\n\n451\n00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,320\nor even Blackberry.\n\n452\n00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,850\nWhy?\nBecause it's the common architecture that\n\n453\n00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,940\neverybody says look, Here's what were\ngonna [INAUDIBLE] around in this is that\n\n454\n00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,780\nAndroid also has a little specialty here,\ntoo.\n\n455\n00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,810\nIn which they also support the 32\nbit intel based processors to,\n\n456\n00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,420\nthat kinda help them to go on and\nmaybe a little bit more heavy weight\n\n457\n00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,090\nprocessing if they need to, and if\nyou're not familiar with these you know,\n\n458\n00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,010\nthe CPU or the central processing unit.\n\n459\n00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,490\nThat's like the brain of the device.\n\n460\n00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,030\nThat's what's actually doing the\nprocessing, doing the work for a device.\n\n461\n00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,800\nAnd ARM processors are optimized for\npower conservation, right.\n\n462\n00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,190\nThey're very energy efficient.\n\n463\n00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,710\nThey're very fast, but\nthey're also energy efficient.\n\n464\n00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,810\nThey make a great fit for mobile devices\nthat are running on battery, right.\n\n465\n00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,810\nSo that's why you see ARM support across\nall for of those, because everybody knows,\n\n466\n00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,020\nhey, you're gonna get battery life out\nof those and get better optimization.\n\n467\n00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,670\nThe other one though, x86, right.\n\n468\n00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,430\nThey're power-hungry.\n\n469\n00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,030\nThey draw that power in,\nand they're very fast.\n\n470\n00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,360\nThey're faster than ARM, all right.\n\n471\n00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,000\nSo, when you have a desktop, or a laptop,\na computer that you're gonna be plugging\n\n472\n00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,680\ninto a wall when you use most of the time,\nmaybe running on battery sometimes.\n\n473\n00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,710\nFor those, they'll go with the x86 and\nthe Intel processors cuz they're faster.\n\n474\n00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,240\nThey have more power behind them.\n\n475\n00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,860\nAll right.\n\n476\n00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,020\nBut they generate a lot of heat so\nthey need a fan attached to them.\n\n477\n00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,070\nAnd, and\nyou just can't do that on a phone.\n\n478\n00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,090\nWhereas in a desktop or\na laptop computer you can have fans.\n\n479\n00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,570\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n480\n00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,000\nSo with the other guys, Apple,\nMicrosoft, Blackberry, they,\n\n481\n00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,560\nthey didn't worry about you know,\ntackling those larger processors.\n\n482\n00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,820\nCuz they have other solutions for that.\n\n483\n00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,920\nBut with Android, they said, what if\nwe wanna have a tablet with a beefier\n\n484\n00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,140\nprocessor or what if we wanna\nroll this out on a laptop?\n\n485\n00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,830\nAnd that's exactly what they\ndid with their Chromebooks.\n\n486\n00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,210\nThey sell these laptops,\nbasically, that run Android and,\n\n487\n00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,850\nall right, a variation of Android.\n\n488\n00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,470\nAnd so they needed that x86 support.\n\n489\n00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,130\nThat's why they added that on there.\n\n490\n00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,220\nIt is kinda neat to have.\n\n491\n00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,850\nIt's not necessarily the most popular\nthing in the world, but, they are for\n\n492\n00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,920\nthe most part running\nthe common arm processor.\n\n493\n00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,810\nLast little road that I have here\ntalked about open and commercial.\n\n494\n00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,290\nNow, a lot of the times you'll hear\nthat we talk about open source\n\n495\n00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,050\nversus proprietary.\n\n496\n00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,450\nComp T specifically uses, I guess it's\na newer terminology that's coming out and\n\n497\n00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,040\nthey pretty much mean the same thing.\n\n498\n00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,130\nFor us, the open source is\nabout the ability of course,\n\n499\n00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,390\nthat everybody contributes to it,\nthat the code is open to them.\n\n500\n00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,170\nYou'll be able to examine it and\nto rewrite if they need to,\n\n501\n00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,490\nwhereas the proprietary or the commercial\nis normally owned by a single company, and\n\n502\n00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,330\nthey're not gonna expose that code to you.\n\n503\n00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,300\n>> And if you're a hardware manufacturer,\nif you're someone who makes cell phones or\n\n504\n00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,300\ntablets, and you wanna run an operating\nsystem for somebody else, well,\n\n505\n00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,290\nyou can run Windows Phone if you want\n>> But you need to reach out to Microsoft\n\n506\n00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,310\nand earn a contract negotiations,\nand you need to pay royalties.\n\n507\n00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,550\nFor every device you sell,\nyou're paying a license back to Microsoft.\n\n508\n00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,670\nOr Blackberry,\nif you wanna do their hardware.\n\n509\n00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,170\nWell actually no, let me correct that,\n\n510\n00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,370\nbecause Blackberry doesn't\nlet anybody else do it.\n\n511\n00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,330\nEvery BlackBerry device\nis actually from them.\n\n512\n00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,820\nJust like Apple,\nevery iOS device is from Apple.\n\n513\n00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,420\nSo Microsoft is really the only one\nthat's licensing it out right now.\n\n514\n00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,775\nAndroid, they do the same thing, but\nthey don't even charge you for it.\n\n515\n00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,555\nThey say, here it is.\n\n516\n00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:31,055\nIt, it's open.\n\n517\n00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:34,275\nIf you join the Open Hand,\nHardware Alliance, the OHA,\n\n518\n00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:38,665\nthen, I almost said Open Hand instead\nof Alliance, which, isn't it Hardware?\n\n519\n00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:39,255\nIt is Hardware.\n\n520\n00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:39,852\nOkay.\n\n521\n00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,282\nSo, hey if you join the OHA,\n\n522\n00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:45,522\nyou'll have access to our AOSP,\nthat's their open source.\n\n523\n00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,652\nIts the Android Open Source Project, AOSP.\n\n524\n00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:50,932\nYou'll have access to that and you can\nthen deploy it on your own cell phones and\n\n525\n00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,062\ntablets and sell it, and\nyou don't have to pay us a dime.\n\n526\n00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:56,014\nWell, that's not entirely true,\n\n527\n00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:59,150\nbecause theres other pieces\nlike the Google Play Store.\n\n528\n00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,166\nThat if you want to feature that,\n\n529\n00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,560\nthe Google Play Store itself\nis actually proprietary.\n\n530\n00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,510\nIt's closed code.\n\n531\n00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,819\nAnd so you can run it,\nbut you can't modify it.\n\n532\n00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,597\nAnd you have to meet certain\nspecifications from Google to,\n\n533\n00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:12,900\nto match that.\n\n534\n00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,580\nBut if you don't need that, if you have\nyour own store, like Amazon, right?\n\n535\n00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,830\nAmazon, you know the,\nthe retailing outlet, Amazon.com.\n\n536\n00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,940\nThey sell a range of tablets\ncalled the Kindle Fire.\n\n537\n00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,650\nAnd the Kindle Fire runs Android.\n\n538\n00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,203\nBut you wouldn't know it looking at it,\n\n539\n00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:30,773\nit looks a lot different than any\nother Android devices out there.\n\n540\n00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:34,770\nAnd that's because Amazon took the free\nparts of Android, and then said,\n\n541\n00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,514\nwe don't need any of the closed stuff,\nany of that Google only stuff,\n\n542\n00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:40,180\nwe'll write that ourselves.\n\n543\n00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,030\nAnd they created their own app store, and\ntheir own web browser, and all their own\n\n544\n00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,750\nlittle pieces, so it's running on\ntop of the free parts of Android.\n\n545\n00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,770\nAnd you're welcome to do that.\n\n546\n00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,370\nAnybody can do that.\n\n547\n00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,590\nThat's kind of the neat part about\nAndroid, is how, how versatile it is.\n\n548\n00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:58,500\nAll right, so\nthose are our mobile operating systems.\n\n549\n00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,150\nYou're not typically gonna\nsee these on a desktop.\n\n550\n00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,850\nSo for example, when, when I showed those\njust a minute ago here on my laptop,\n\n551\n00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,560\nI'm not actually running those OSs.\n\n552\n00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,579\nI've got them in, in these special\nsimulators to be able to display them and,\n\n553\n00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,780\nand work with them.\n\n554\n00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,010\nBut you'll normally see them\non your mobile devices.\n\n555\n00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,990\nYour phones, your tablets, and that's it.\n\n556\n00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,655\nOn the desktop side of things and\nthe laptop side of things,\n\n557\n00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:24,590\nthose OSs that we just discussed\naren't really suitable anymore.\n\n558\n00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,320\nYou've got much larger screens.\n\n559\n00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,512\nYou've got a lot of different peripherals.\n\n560\n00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:31,050\nPrinters, and, and external\ndevices that you're gonna hook up,\n\n561\n00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,230\nthat just don't work with a cellphone.\n\n562\n00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,160\nAnd so we really need a stronger\noperating system to handle that.\n\n563\n00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,960\nAnd the desktop and laptop operating\nsystems have really been out for a long,\n\n564\n00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,910\nlong time and evolved quite a lot,\n\n565\n00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,980\nversus these mobile operating\nsystems that are fairly new, right?\n\n566\n00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,711\nOf the four in your slide, Ronny,\n\n567\n00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,860\nI think IOS was the first one\nto come out which was in 2006?\n\n568\n00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,370\n>> I believe so.\n\n569\n00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,270\n>> 2006 or 2007.\nWhich well I guess depending on which year\n\n570\n00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,061\nyou watch this video in was\nprobably about eight years ago.\n\n571\n00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,300\nYou know, seven to eight years ago.\n\n572\n00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,150\nVersus some of the desktop operating\nsystems we're gonna talk about that have\n\n573\n00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,100\nbeen out for almost 30 years now.\n\n574\n00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,790\nSo the desktop OSs are much more mature,\nhave a much larger\n\n575\n00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,600\namount of applications that can run on\nthem, and more powerful hardware support,\n\n576\n00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,360\nso on the desktop and\nlaptop side we get a lot more power.\n\n577\n00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,860\nAll right?\n\n578\n00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,920\nBut looking at the clock this is probably\na good spot to stop and take a break.\n\n579\n00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,358\nAnd so when we get back we're gonna\ntake a look at those desktop OSs or\n\n580\n00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:32,350\nworkstation OSs and\nget a chance to see what they line up.\n\n581\n00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,810\nAll right, so stay tuned.\n\n582\n00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,116\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n583\n00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:42,569\n[MUSIC]\n\n584\n00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,530\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n585\n00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,390\nSo in the first segment,\n\n586\n00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,290\nwe got a chance to see some of the mobile\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n587\n00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,312\nNow we're gonna take a look at some\nof the, not so mobile [CROSSTALK]\n\n588\n00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,249\n>> Right.\n\n589\n00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,500\n>> [LAUGH] The operating systems\nthat are designed to run on normal\n\n590\n00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,880\ncomputers, right?\n\n591\n00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,950\nI'm not talking about cell phones or\ntablets.\n\n592\n00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,284\nI, I'm talking about desktops and\nlaptops, or full function PCs.\n\n593\n00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:09,580\nSo what you know, what,\nwhat's our big difference here?\n\n594\n00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,650\nWell, when you talk about\na fully functional PC,\n\n595\n00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,390\nwe don't have the same\nlimitations as mobile.\n\n596\n00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,946\nFor example, you'll typically have a,\na very large screen attached to a,\n\n597\n00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:22,450\na fully functional PC or laptop, right?\n\n598\n00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,533\n17 inches or even bigger screens,\nversus a cellphone,\n\n599\n00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:28,600\nwhich you wouldn't want\na 17 inch cell phone.\n\n600\n00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,326\nI'm sure somebody out there does,\nbut most people wouldn't.\n\n601\n00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:33,130\nSo, you know, it, it's gonna be\na pretty big difference there, right?\n\n602\n00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,930\nThe amount of data we can\ndisplay on the screen.\n\n603\n00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,748\nWe also have things like physically\nattached keyboards and, and mice.\n\n604\n00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,640\nWe usually don't have to worry\nabout battery because we're\n\n605\n00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,910\nplugged into the wall.\n\n606\n00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,360\nSo a lot of the considerations that we\nhave under mobile just aren't there\n\n607\n00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,660\non the desktop side.\n\n608\n00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,160\nAnd so the desktop operating\nsystems can be far more\n\n609\n00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,335\npowerful than those we\nfind in the mobile side.\n\n610\n00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:56,140\n>> Yeah,\nnot only is it the power in desktop and\n\n611\n00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,730\nthe operating system, but also in\nthe applications that we install too.\n\n612\n00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,930\nWe don't tend to have to be lightweight or\nworry so much about the battery life.\n\n613\n00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,470\nThey, they worry more about functionality\nthan they do about power consumption.\n\n614\n00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,040\nSo there's a lot of,\nof flexibility in having a desktop, but\n\n615\n00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,515\nnot a lot of mo mobility or portability.\n\n616\n00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:16,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n617\n00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,790\n>> Now the other nice\nthing about desktops and\n\n618\n00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,870\nlaptops is they've been\naround a long time.\n\n619\n00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,780\nThe original desktop,\ndesktops, at least as we know,\n\n620\n00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,800\nthem really were popularized in the 80s.\n\n621\n00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,060\nSome came out in the, the late 70s.\n\n622\n00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,050\nBut really in the 1980s is when\nwe saw desktop PCs start to grow.\n\n623\n00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,290\nAnd at that times, this is 30 years ago,\nyou had a lot developers\n\n624\n00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,670\nthat were creating applications,\nmany of which have come and gone.\n\n625\n00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,200\nAnd gone into the,\nthe realms of nostalgia and\n\n626\n00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,270\nwe joke around about\nthem here in the show.\n\n627\n00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,870\nBut others are still around.\n\n628\n00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,180\nThere's applications that were developed\nin the 1980s that we still use today.\n\n629\n00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,930\nGranted they've been heavily upgraded and\nmodified.\n\n630\n00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,910\nAnd if you think about it, if you've\nbeen slowly improving software for\n\n631\n00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,540\n30 years, by the time you get to\ntoday they're probably pretty good.\n\n632\n00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,080\nLaptops, on the other hand,\nbegan to become popularized in the 1990s.\n\n633\n00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,160\nThey had laptops in the 80s, but they were\nhuge and heavy, and not very portable.\n\n634\n00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,060\nAnd so it wasn't really until the 90s that\nthey started shrinking down to become a,\n\n635\n00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,090\na reasonable size.\n\n636\n00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480\nSo laptops are really\nthe same as desktops.\n\n637\n00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,250\nUsually have the same type of processor.\n\n638\n00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,990\nSame, same construction.\n\n639\n00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,320\nBut their optimized for heat and,\nand, and size mostly, right?\n\n640\n00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,640\nIt's called micronization.\n\n641\n00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,030\nThey try and\nmarket things as small as possible.\n\n642\n00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,960\nBut that environment,\n\n643\n00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,250\nthat standard desktop and\nlaptop environment has been around for\n\n644\n00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,945\na long time, versus the mobile apps that\nwe see, things on tablets and cellphones.\n\n645\n00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:42,875\nThat market has really enlarged\nin the last eight years.\n\n646\n00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,525\nThat is a,\na small time compared to the others.\n\n647\n00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:50,020\nSo when we talk about the Apple app store\nhaving over a million apps, well the,\n\n648\n00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,480\nthe standard PCs,\nthe desktop PCs, they have\n\n649\n00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,020\nmillions upon millions of apps because\nthey've been around a long, long time.\n\n650\n00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,420\nAnd, and\nthere's a ton of different systems and\n\n651\n00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,800\nsoftware that are developed\nto run on them.\n\n652\n00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,300\nAll right?\n\n653\n00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,726\nSo let's talk about some of the different\noperating systems we'll encounter on that.\n\n654\n00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:09,246\nWhen you go to the store and\nyou buy a desktop PC or, or a laptop,\n\n655\n00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:12,800\nit's going to come with\nan operating system pre-installed.\n\n656\n00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,740\nIf it is a, well most common machine, then\nit's gonna be running Microsoft Windows.\n\n657\n00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,570\nWhen you buy a desktop that is from HP,\nor Dell, or Gateway, somebody like that,\n\n658\n00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:28,610\nthe number one consumer operating system,\nbased on sales, right, not necessarily\n\n659\n00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,710\ncustomer satisfaction, but [LAUGH] but\nbased on sales is Microsoft Windows.\n\n660\n00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,870\nAll right Microsoft is a company\nthat's been around since the 70s.\n\n661\n00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,280\nThey're over 30 years old.\n\n662\n00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,020\nThey are really kind of synonymous\nwith business computing.\n\n663\n00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,290\nThey've been around a long time.\n\n664\n00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,010\nThey've, they've pushed for a lot of\nthe software packages that we use.\n\n665\n00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,260\nAnd their Windows operating system is\npretty much the de facto standard for\n\n666\n00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,880\nbusinesses, all right.\n\n667\n00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,040\nSo, Microsoft Windows, that's what\na lot of us are gonna be familiar with.\n\n668\n00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,670\nI've got a, a Windows machine right here.\n\n669\n00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,730\nSo this is Microsoft Windows 7.\n\n670\n00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,500\nThere have been many,\nmany different versions, right?\n\n671\n00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,301\nWindows 3.1, 95, 98 Windows Millennium\nEdition, that one was awesome.\n\n672\n00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,510\n>> For me, yup.\n\n673\n00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,950\n>> You had Windows NT, Windows 2000,\n\n674\n00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,340\nWindows XP, see if I can\nremember all the rest from there.\n\n675\n00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,870\n>> Vista.\n\n676\n00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,090\n>> Windows Vista,\nwe had Windows 7, Windows 8,\n\n677\n00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,530\nand now they've announced Windows 10.\n\n678\n00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,200\n>> All of these are progressively\nnewer versions of their Windows\n\n679\n00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,880\noperating system.\n\n680\n00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,240\nAnd they make improvements along the way.\n\n681\n00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,300\nAnd they have a few missteps.\n\n682\n00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,060\nSo every now and then,\none of the OSs is really, really bad and\n\n683\n00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,740\npeople don't like it.\n\n684\n00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,190\nAnd then you get ones that are really,\nreally good.\n\n685\n00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,790\nWindows 7 was probably the last\none that people really loved.\n\n686\n00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,500\nAnd so it,\nit's a very common one that's out there.\n\n687\n00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,120\nSo this is Windows 7.\n\n688\n00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,980\nAnd with an operating system like\nthis what you're really getting is\n\n689\n00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,010\na user interface,\na way to talk to the computer.\n\n690\n00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,180\nAnd Windows has always been\neasily recognizable because of\n\n691\n00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,720\nwhat's called their Start menu.\n\n692\n00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,500\nThat you have a little button in your\nbottom left corner and when you click on\n\n693\n00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,643\nit, it brings up a menu so that you can\nchoose various options, launch programs.\n\n694\n00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,141\nYou can search for\nthings and, and find them.\n\n695\n00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:05,319\nSo you get a chance to see all those\ndifferent components you know,\n\n696\n00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,181\njust right here.\n\n697\n00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:09,130\nAnd then when you run your program,\nlike if I want to browse the internet,\n\n698\n00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,570\nI might fire up Internet Explorer.\n\n699\n00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,670\nAnd when I run that program,\nnow I'm working in the software.\n\n700\n00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,899\nAnd one of the most important things for a\ndesktop OS is they know that there's a lot\n\n701\n00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,940\nof power, so you can run more than\none application at the same time.\n\n702\n00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,060\nSo I might be running a web browser\nwhile I browse the internet and\n\n703\n00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,920\nI might be running a word processor\nwhile I write up some show notes.\n\n704\n00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,550\nAll right?\n\n705\n00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,500\nSo this is called multitasking.\n\n706\n00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,320\nI'm doing more than one\nthing at the same time.\n\n707\n00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,870\nAnd the Windows operating system will\nhelp me with that by making it easy for\n\n708\n00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,920\nme to switch between my systems.\n\n709\n00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,340\nTo be able to jump back and forth between\nmy different software packages, all right?\n\n710\n00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,060\nAnd because I have a lot of screen\nreal estate, my screen is big right?\n\n711\n00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,740\nI can take this software and I can arrange\nit in a way, that I can see more than one\n\n712\n00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,670\nprogram at the same time, or at least I\ncan try to, why is it not snapping for me?\n\n713\n00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,640\nThere we go.\n\n714\n00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,490\nSo I can get my,\nmy web browser over here, and\n\n715\n00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,150\nlet's see if we can get\nus some kind of website.\n\n716\n00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,630\nThis is [LAUGH] an unupdated browser,\nso it failed our IT Pro TV check.\n\n717\n00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,019\nBut but here I can go, and\n\n718\n00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,200\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna see some webpages\nthat have a little problem.\n\n719\n00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,940\nBut I can see my webpage there,\nI'm browsing the internet, over here,\n\n720\n00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,280\nI've got my show notes, so\nI'm kind of working together, or\n\n721\n00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,580\nif I want to make them even bigger I can\ndo that, and the operating system will\n\n722\n00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,465\ngive me some kind of mechanism\nto quickly flip between, whoops,\n\n723\n00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:40,210\n[LAUGH] not like that to quickly flip\nbetween the applications that I'm running.\n\n724\n00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,340\nSo I can flip back and forth.\n\n725\n00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,440\nI'm using a keyboard shortcut here,\nAlt+Tab but I could be clicking these\n\n726\n00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,545\nlittle buttons down here to get to\nWordPad, to get back to Internet Explorer,\n\n727\n00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:54,040\nyou know, jumping back and\nforth between these different systems.\n\n728\n00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,790\nThat's a part of what your\noperating system does.\n\n729\n00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,600\nRight?\nIt's facilitating you working with\n\n730\n00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,490\nthe software you need.\n\n731\n00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,910\nAnd you talking to the computer.\n\n732\n00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,130\nAll right, so Windows 7 pretty common.\n\n733\n00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,102\nWindows 8 is the current version of\nwindows that's on sale right now and\n\n734\n00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:15,535\nthey've actually replaced that start menu\nwith a new, they call it a modern UI,\n\n735\n00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:20,095\nthere's this new layout, it has not been\ngenerally accepted by the public and\n\n736\n00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:22,702\nso in Windows 10 which\nhave been announced but\n\n737\n00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:26,840\nnot released yet, they're actually\nbringing this start menu back.\n\n738\n00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,210\nSo that's part of why I wanted to\nshow you Windows 7 here on the show\n\n739\n00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,860\ninstead of Windows 8,\n\n740\n00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,500\nbecause they're going back to this kind\nof start menu mode like we have here.\n\n741\n00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,310\nAll right.\nSo that's an example of Microsoft Windows.\n\n742\n00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,630\nWe'll see more of it as the show continues\nbut, you know, just as an example,\n\n743\n00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,510\nthat's probably one of the most common\noperating systems deployed today.\n\n744\n00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,930\nAll right, another one is\nthe operating system from Apple.\n\n745\n00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,280\nBefore the iPhone, before the iPad.\n\n746\n00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,390\nApple was a computer company,\nthey still are, right?\n\n747\n00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,940\nThey made computers, and\nwhen they sold their computers,\n\n748\n00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,260\nthey sold them packaged with\ntheir own operating system,\n\n749\n00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,055\nan operating system you\ncouldn't buy any other way.\n\n750\n00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:12,030\nYou've got it with an Apple computer,\nand that was it.\n\n751\n00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,180\nMicrosoft Windows, you can buy that and\ninstall it on any computer you want.\n\n752\n00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,610\nThey, they don't,\nthey don't care about hardware.\n\n753\n00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,670\nMicrosoft is not a hardware company.\n\n754\n00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,890\nBut Apple is.\n\n755\n00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,750\nApple is a hardware company first,\na software company second.\n\n756\n00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,300\nAnd so their operating system\nis a product that they make, but\n\n757\n00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,190\nthey don't really charge you for.\n\n758\n00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,740\nUpdates are normally free and\n\n759\n00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,270\nthe software is normally just\nincluded with your hardware.\n\n760\n00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:39,210\nSo when you buy an Apple, it has this\nsoftware on it and it's called Mac OS.\n\n761\n00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,990\nBack in the day, Apple called\ntheir computers Macintoshes and so\n\n762\n00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,130\nyou had the Macintosh Operating System or\nMac OS.\n\n763\n00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,200\nAnd it's gone through several\nrevisions over the years.\n\n764\n00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,360\nThe most current one is Mac OS 10.10\nwhich was code named Yosemite.\n\n765\n00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,480\nSo you'll hear people call\nit Yosemite sometimes.\n\n766\n00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,480\nThere's always a code name\nassigned to the, the Mac OSs.\n\n767\n00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,440\nMicrosoft does the same thing,\nthey give a code name, but they,\n\n768\n00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,830\nthey usually don't tell people\nthe code name and it, it goes away.\n\n769\n00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,620\nApple likes to keep theirs,\ncuz it's I don't know for\n\n770\n00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,495\nsome reason I guess they like it.\n\n771\n00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It makes them happy.\n\n772\n00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,650\nSo Mac OS very similar to Windows.\n\n773\n00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,630\nAll right.\n\n774\n00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,710\nIt gives you a user interface.\n\n775\n00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,990\nThis is the Mac OS interface right here.\n\n776\n00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,320\nAnd you can see I've got\nsome icons on my desktop.\n\n777\n00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,910\nIn Windows 7 the icons were on\nthe left side of the screen.\n\n778\n00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,940\nIn Mac OS the icons go to\nthe right side of the screen.\n\n779\n00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,170\nSo subtle little differences.\n\n780\n00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,180\nI don't have a start menu.\n\n781\n00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,610\nInstead, what I have is a launching dock.\n\n782\n00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,050\nYou'll see this little launcher\ndown here at the bottom, right.\n\n783\n00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,120\nThis is my dock, and\nI can pick from various applications,\n\n784\n00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,730\njust like in the Windows start menu,\nright, so very, very similar.\n\n785\n00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,840\nI have various applications pinned\nright here that I can launch.\n\n786\n00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,900\nAnd if I want to do a search,\nwell you'll see the search\n\n787\n00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,070\nis a little magnifying glass\nstuck up here in the title bar.\n\n788\n00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,770\nAnd so I can go and fire that up, and\nif I want to fire up a text editor, I can.\n\n789\n00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,750\nAnd so there's my,\n\n790\n00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,300\nmy text editor asking me if I want\nto create a new file, which I will.\n\n791\n00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,390\nSo there's my text editor.\n\n792\n00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,590\nAnd if I wanna browse the internet,\nI can fire up Safari.\n\n793\n00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,210\nThere's my web browser.\n\n794\n00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,730\nSo I can launch that and\nI can go to a website.\n\n795\n00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,920\nAnd again, it, it's allowing me to\nmanage these different programs.\n\n796\n00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,290\nSo I can have more than one program.\n\n797\n00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,600\nI'm multitasking, switching between them,\nand doing whatever I need to do.\n\n798\n00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,930\nSo If I go to a, you know,\na web page over here,\n\n799\n00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,350\nif I start writing my show notes\nover here then we get it, all right?\n\n800\n00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,820\nNow they,\nthey don't give us an easy way to snap\n\n801\n00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,730\nyour software to the edge of\nthe screen like we saw in Windows\n\n802\n00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,640\nalthough I use a little software package\nthat kinda adds it after the fact.\n\n803\n00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,820\nSo just to keep it apples to apples here.\n\n804\n00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,928\nNo, no pun intended.\n\n805\n00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:47,810\nI'll [LAUGH] I'll use that but\nbut you'll see here, so\n\n806\n00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,280\nI got my web browser fired up.\n\n807\n00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,520\nI got my show notes and\nnow I can sit in here and work.\n\n808\n00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,140\nRight?\n\n809\n00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,020\nThe operating systems are really\nproviding me the same functionality.\n\n810\n00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,650\nA way to work with applications and\n\n811\n00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,780\ninteract with the computer but\nthey just do it in a different way.\n\n812\n00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,520\nApple prides themselves in\ncreating a visually appealing and\n\n813\n00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,540\neasy to use interface.\n\n814\n00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,970\nMicrosoft prides themselves\nin creating a very robust and\n\n815\n00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,430\nbackwards compatible operating system.\n\n816\n00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,370\nThey don't want you to have to buy new\nsoftware every time you update Windows,\n\n817\n00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,900\nand so they they try and\n\n818\n00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,210\nprovide that backwards compatibility\nas far back as they can.\n\n819\n00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,200\nAll right, so that is Windows,\nfrom Microsoft, and\n\n820\n00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,150\nMac OS from Apple,\nwho's next on our list, Ronnie?\n\n821\n00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,940\n>> We have Linux.\n\n822\n00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,960\n>> Linux.\n\n823\n00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,980\nNow Linux is a, a tricky one.\n\n824\n00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,720\nRight?\n\n825\n00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,190\nBecause the first two,\n\n826\n00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,490\nWindows and, and Mac OS, those were from\ncompanies, Microsoft and, and Apple.\n\n827\n00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,320\nWho is Linux from?\n\n828\n00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,990\n>> Yeah, Linux is actually\nan open source development.\n\n829\n00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,970\nBut it originally spawned\nfrom a young man named Linus,\n\n830\n00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,510\nif I can pronounce it,\nLinus Torvalds, or Lenus Torvalds.\n\n831\n00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,560\nAnd in the, in the early 90s,\nreally like 1991.\n\n832\n00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,130\nIs that I wanna build this kernel\nof an operating system, and\n\n833\n00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,810\nmake it available to every one.\n\n834\n00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,130\nAnd so it really spawned from him, and\nthen everybody was able to take that\n\n835\n00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:16,090\nkernel and begin to develop their own\nbranded operating system based on this\n\n836\n00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,349\nwhat we call a kernel, which is really\nthe heart of the operating system.\n\n837\n00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:23,140\n>> And unlike the other products we talked\nabout, with Linux, it's open source.\n\n838\n00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,880\nAnybody can go and download the entire\nsource code for the software.\n\n839\n00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,320\nIf you're a programmer\nyou write an application\n\n840\n00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,930\nyou're writing what's called source code.\n\n841\n00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,430\nAll the different commands that go\ninto building that software together.\n\n842\n00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,300\nAnd then you, you do what's called\ncompiling it which is what makes\n\n843\n00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,070\nthe software run.\n\n844\n00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,290\nAnd if you have the compiled\nversion of a program, it'll run but\n\n845\n00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,560\nyou can't see how it was written.\n\n846\n00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,780\nYou can't modify it.\n\n847\n00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,960\nSo to modify it, you need the source code.\n\n848\n00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,930\nWell Apple and Microsoft do not\ndistribute their source code.\n\n849\n00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,980\nYou cannot modify those OSs.\n\n850\n00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,020\nBut with Linux you can.\n\n851\n00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,201\nThey freely distribute it to everybody and\neverybody's added on to it so\n\n852\n00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,606\nthere's no one author of Linux anymore.\n\n853\n00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,751\nIt's been developed by\nThousands of volunteers.\n\n854\n00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:07,110\nAnd it's all volunteer work because the OS\nis free, they don't charge money for it.\n\n855\n00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,750\nAll right.\n\n856\n00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,520\nNow, when you want to go and\n\n857\n00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,660\nget Linux to try it out, you get to pick\nbetween what are called distributions.\n\n858\n00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,828\nAnd, there are hundreds of distributions.\n\n859\n00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:21,060\nAnd these are companies who have taken\nLinux, taken that open source product and\n\n860\n00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,110\npackaged it together with all\nthe different things that we need,\n\n861\n00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,260\nthe user interface, the, you know,\n\n862\n00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,400\nthe window manager, all the things\nwe saw on the other lessons.\n\n863\n00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,050\nAnd, each one of these companies\npackages it a little bit differently.\n\n864\n00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,950\nAnd so, you pick the distributor that has\nthe features you need that matches up with\n\n865\n00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,790\nwhat you want.\n\n866\n00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,470\nYou might try one and hate it,\ntry another one and love it, right?\n\n867\n00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,220\nSo, there's a lot of variety there.\n\n868\n00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,390\nAnd, there are ones that cost money.\n\n869\n00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,420\nLinux is not always free.\n\n870\n00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,440\nThe free ones generally\ncome with no support.\n\n871\n00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,560\nIf you've got a problem,\nthere's nobody to call.\n\n872\n00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,300\nWith Mac OS, you can call Apple.\n\n873\n00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,810\nWith Windows, you can call Microsoft.\n\n874\n00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,110\nAnd, while they do usually charge for\nsupport, they will help you.\n\n875\n00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,160\nWhen Linux,\na lot of times there's nobody to call.\n\n876\n00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,550\nBut, with the paid versions of Linux,\nthere is.\n\n877\n00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,390\nSo companies like Red Hat,\n\n878\n00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,680\nthey're probably the most prominent\ncompany that sells Linux.\n\n879\n00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,880\nWhat they're selling is not so\n\n880\n00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,622\nmuch the operating system under the hood,\nwhat they're selling is their support.\n\n881\n00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:18,020\nYou know, somebody to be there on the\nphone to help you if you have an issue,\n\n882\n00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,850\nand some proprietary software they have\nadded to Linux to make it better, right?\n\n883\n00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,690\nAnd, there's other companies\nthat are good, too.\n\n884\n00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,960\nCanonical is one, where they\nreally do sell support for Linux.\n\n885\n00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,860\nNow, the Linux operation system itself,\n\n886\n00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,160\nlet's see I've got that\nparked around here somewhere.\n\n887\n00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,140\nHere we go.\n\n888\n00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,130\nThis is a,\na Linux distribution called Cent OS.\n\n889\n00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,420\nIt is based on Red Hat.\n\n890\n00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,010\nAnd, it is probably one of the most\ncommonly deployed Linux distributions.\n\n891\n00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,470\nWhy I picked it.\n\n892\n00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,550\nAnd, I'm sitting here at my login screen.\n\n893\n00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,860\nLet me just get logged in to this thing.\n\n894\n00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,540\nAnd when I get logged in,\nI'll see my desktop.\n\n895\n00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,490\nAnd, it's a graphical desktop.\n\n896\n00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,890\nAlthough with, with Linux, you can disable\nthe graphical desktop if you want.\n\n897\n00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,280\nBut here's my graphical desktop, and\nsimilar to the other operating systems,\n\n898\n00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,870\nwe've got a menu that\nwe can access things.\n\n899\n00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,880\nIn Windows, we had a start\nmenu here at the bottom left.\n\n900\n00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,940\nis Mac OS,\n\n901\n00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,660\nwe had our launcher, our dock that was\ndocked at the bottom of the screen.\n\n902\n00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,810\nAnd here in Linux, we actually have\na start menu up at the top left.\n\n903\n00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,990\nBut, it's fully customizable.\n\n904\n00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,200\nYou could actually change this to\nlook any number of different ways.\n\n905\n00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,870\nBut, I can click on that and I can see my\nvarious applications that I can launch.\n\n906\n00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,760\nSo for example,\nmy web browser is right here.\n\n907\n00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,140\nIf I don't know where my application is,\nthere is actually a search in there.\n\n908\n00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,760\nAnd, so we could go in and search for\n\n909\n00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,330\nthings that we need to in other\nconfigurations and settings.\n\n910\n00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,980\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nkind of buried away in here,\n\n911\n00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,088\nbased on whatever it is you need to do.\n\n912\n00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:40,987\nAll right.\n\n913\n00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:42,305\nSo, you know, maybe here.\n\n914\n00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:43,935\nI'll, I'll fire up a word processor and\n\n915\n00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:46,195\na web browser just like I\ndid with the other ones.\n\n916\n00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:48,555\nNow, the word processor, the web browser.\n\n917\n00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:49,555\nThese things that I'm firing up.\n\n918\n00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:50,705\nThese are all free too.\n\n919\n00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:53,635\nThey're packaged here as a part\nof this operating system.\n\n920\n00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:58,505\nSo here's Libre Writer,\nwhich is a world processor for Linux.\n\n921\n00:42:58,505 --> 00:43:01,545\nAnd I'm just gonna kinda move it,\ntry and move it off to the side.\n\n922\n00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,465\nKind of my goal here.\n\n923\n00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,810\nAnd, and so, we'll just kind\nof stick it off to the side.\n\n924\n00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,310\nAnd, I'm now multitasking.\n\n925\n00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,110\nI'm running more than one\nprogram at the same time.\n\n926\n00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,760\nAnd CentOS is taking care of that for\nme, all right.\n\n927\n00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,720\nSo again, that's really the whole point\nof these operating systems is to be able\n\n928\n00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,552\nto do that and, let me just fire up.\n\n929\n00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:23,610\nI wanna do the same thing I did on,\non the other guys.\n\n930\n00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,290\nAnd so, I'm doing that over there,\nand I'm typing my show notes here.\n\n931\n00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,370\nSo there we go, I'm browsing the internet,\nI'm typing in my word processor.\n\n932\n00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,880\nI'm working in my system.\n\n933\n00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560\nI can switch between my\nprograms with a quick drop down\n\n934\n00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,310\nup top where my applications.\n\n935\n00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:40,440\nI got my running programs right\ndown here I can flip between.\n\n936\n00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,620\nAll managed by an easy to use\ngraphical user interface.\n\n937\n00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,280\nNow because Linux is deployed by\nnumerous different organizations,\n\n938\n00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,370\nyou can customize it.\n\n939\n00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,260\nAnd so oftentimes, going between three\ndifferent computers running Linux,\n\n940\n00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,080\nmay have three completely\ndifferent user interfaces.\n\n941\n00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,750\nAnd, that can be a little confusing.\n\n942\n00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,030\nLinux is not considered an entry\nlevel operating system.\n\n943\n00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:05,450\nUnless it's tuned and, and adjusted,\nit's not really great for beginners.\n\n944\n00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,000\nRight?\nNow,\n\n945\n00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,270\nthere are special distributions that are,\nbut the typical ones are not.\n\n946\n00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,692\nMost people view Linux as a server\noperating system, which it does great at.\n\n947\n00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,400\nBut also an advanced user or\n\n948\n00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,730\ndeveloper operating system because\nthat's who it was originally targeted.\n\n949\n00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:19,580\nBut in the last few years,\n\n950\n00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,160\nwe've seen a lot of growth where they're\nmaking it more accessible to end users.\n\n951\n00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,650\nAnd for most of you, even if this\nwas the first time you saw Linux,\n\n952\n00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,250\nyou saw me moving around.\n\n953\n00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,815\nYou could probably handle it just fine.\n\n954\n00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:33,610\nRight?\nIt wasn't like that even eight years\n\n955\n00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,110\nago really.\n\n956\n00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,000\nIts just in the last few years that\nwe've seen this improvement, and\n\n957\n00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,790\nits a lot more user friendly\nthen it used to be.\n\n958\n00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,230\n>> And Don, that's a great term.\n\n959\n00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,510\nThe term user friendly.\n\n960\n00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,644\nIn every operating system\nthat we've seen so far,\n\n961\n00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:49,350\nwhether its been the Mac OS10,\nwhether its been the Windows 7.\n\n962\n00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,070\nAnd now, even with the Linux\ndistribution system that we're seeing,\n\n963\n00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,920\nthat term user friendly\nis pretty much the key.\n\n964\n00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,270\nIt's means that it's designed for\n\n965\n00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,700\nyou and me to be able to simply\njust pick up a mouse if we need to,\n\n966\n00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,040\nto search a little bit, and\nbegin to use the operating system.\n\n967\n00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,940\nEven though, Don has just told us that\nLinux is normally considered an advanced\n\n968\n00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,720\noperating system,\nthey are starting to show more and\n\n969\n00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,110\nmore of these distributions\nthat are user friendly.\n\n970\n00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,410\nWhich means We can easily learn it.\n\n971\n00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,320\nWe're willing to take a little bit\nof time to, to, explore it and\n\n972\n00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,330\nto be bale to do that.\n\n973\n00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,310\nWe'll see that,\nregardless of which one you're on,\n\n974\n00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,750\nyou should be able to do the same\nfunctionality across all three.\n\n975\n00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,830\n>> Yeah, now these operating systems,\n\n976\n00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,350\nI made sure to do stuff that\nyour average user would do.\n\n977\n00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,570\nI've fired up a word processor.\n\n978\n00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,615\nI've fired up a web browser.\n\n979\n00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:34,470\nMost of us use web browsers\nconstantly these days.\n\n980\n00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,480\nAnd, it's because of the focus of,\nof software moving to the internet.\n\n981\n00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,950\nWell, some vendors, some operating system\nvendors have taken this to an extreme.\n\n982\n00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,240\nAnd, a great example of that is Chrome OS.\n\n983\n00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,750\nChrome OS is an operating\nsystem from Google.\n\n984\n00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,400\nRight?\nMuch like Android is from Google,\n\n985\n00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,210\nChrome OS is also from Google.\n\n986\n00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,610\nAnd, what Chrome OS is, is a special\noperating system that you can run on a,\n\n987\n00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,850\non a laptop.\n\n988\n00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:03,180\nThat it basically provides you access\nto a web browser and that's it.\n\n989\n00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,470\nNo ability to install applications\noutside of what a web browser will do.\n\n990\n00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:12,080\nAnd since most users are just using\nthe web these days for e-mail and\n\n991\n00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,910\nsocial networking, and document writing\nand all of that, that's perfectly fine.\n\n992\n00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,830\nAnd, that brings the cost of\nthose computers way, way down.\n\n993\n00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:25,790\nA good, well spec'd laptop is usually\ngoing to cost around $800 to $1000.\n\n994\n00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:31,180\nBut a Chromebook, which is what they, they\ncall them will usually run around $200.\n\n995\n00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,830\nRight, a fraction of\nthe cost of a full size, or\n\n996\n00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,400\na regular powered laptop, because it's\njust providing you a web browser.\n\n997\n00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,030\nEverything else is done\nout there on the cloud.\n\n998\n00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,570\nSo, we're seeing more of these evolve,\nthey haven't really caught on yet, right?\n\n999\n00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,410\nMost people haven't heard\nof the Chromebooks,\n\n1000\n00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,740\nand Chrom OS is not a household name yet.\n\n1001\n00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,650\nBut over the next few years,\nwe're gonna see that continue to grow and\n\n1002\n00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,610\ngrow as more and more people look for\n\n1003\n00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:57,430\nlow cost alternatives to get inexpensive,\nand easy to deal with computers.\n\n1004\n00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,120\nThat if they break,\nthey just replace, right?\n\n1005\n00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,242\nYou know, nothing to repair.\n\n1006\n00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:03,840\nAn, d I,\nI would love to show you guys Chrome OS,\n\n1007\n00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,520\nbut Google actually locks\nthat to the Chromebooks.\n\n1008\n00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,780\nThere is an open source version\nof it called Chromium, but it,\n\n1009\n00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,640\nit's not the same.\n\n1010\n00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,440\nAnd so, I, I don't have a,\na demonstration for that one.\n\n1011\n00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,080\nBut, if you've seen\nthe Google Chrome web browser,\n\n1012\n00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,920\nwhich actually I think I've got\nrunning here in the background.\n\n1013\n00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,110\nLet me just show you.\n\n1014\n00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,340\nIf I take my Google Chrome web browser and\n\n1015\n00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,770\nI make it full screen,\nthat's what Chrome OS looks like.\n\n1016\n00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,440\nIt, it's basically that.\n\n1017\n00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,550\nYou know, you launch,\nyou get into this web browser.\n\n1018\n00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,575\nAnd then, you've got tabs and\nyou can install applications.\n\n1019\n00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:34,210\nYou know, in, in Google Chrome,\nthey have this whole\n\n1020\n00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,820\napp store that you can fire up to do\nimbedded applications and that's it.\n\n1021\n00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,420\nIt's just limited to that environment.\n\n1022\n00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,420\nThey're super easy to manage.\n\n1023\n00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,870\nSince you're doing all your work on the\nweb, all your data is stored in the cloud.\n\n1024\n00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,570\nIf your hard drive fails,\nyou don't lose anything.\n\n1025\n00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,240\nRight?\nThat, that's kind of the advantage\n\n1026\n00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,790\nof having a system like that.\n\n1027\n00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,339\n>> Yeah.\nThe only disadvantage here of course on\n\n1028\n00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:56,305\nthose Chromebooks is you can't\ninstall those regular desktop apps.\n\n1029\n00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:59,353\nSo, the ones that you tend to buy,\nand put a CD or\n\n1030\n00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:01,191\na DVD in and\n>> And go ahead and\n\n1031\n00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:04,703\nget that to install on the system cause\nthey're not really designed for it.\n\n1032\n00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:07,520\n>> Yeah, so, those are some of\nthe main operating systems.\n\n1033\n00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,620\nNow, if you're an operating system\naficionado like I am, Ronnie you\n\n1034\n00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,835\nkn- Ronnie used to always tease me cause\nI format my laptop every couple of weeks.\n\n1035\n00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:16,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Usually.\n\n1036\n00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,943\n>> And, and so I'm constantly trying\nnew operating systems and re,\n\n1037\n00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,810\nremembering old operating systems.\n\n1038\n00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,220\nThere have been many many more, right?\n\n1039\n00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,780\nYou know, from Solaris,\nOS/2, FreeBSD there's just,\n\n1040\n00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,260\nthere's a ton of them out there.\n\n1041\n00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,770\nMany of which are very popular,\nlike FreeBSD, but on the server side.\n\n1042\n00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,800\nOperating systems normally have a focus,\nsomething that they're designed for, and\n\n1043\n00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,550\nthe ones that we've seen here these\nare the main ones that are designed for\n\n1044\n00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,050\ngeneral use.\n\n1045\n00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,260\nThe other ones normally have something\na little more specific they focus on.\n\n1046\n00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,170\nSo, if your operating system of choice\nwasn't in that list, don't feel bad.\n\n1047\n00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,344\nYou know, it's just that your operating\nsystem is, is not designed for\n\n1048\n00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:54,340\ngeneral purpose use.\n\n1049\n00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,660\nThere, or just hasn't won out yet, right?\n\n1050\n00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,010\nNew operating systems\ncreep up all the time, and\n\n1051\n00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,800\nit's only a matter of time before the next\ngreat operating system comes along and\n\n1052\n00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,150\nthis list starts to change.\n\n1053\n00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,600\nAll right, so Ronnie,\n\n1054\n00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,913\nyou've got a good comparison\n>> Right.\n\n1055\n00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:08,650\n>> of the OS's, right?\n\n1056\n00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,140\nThe pro and con and all that?\n\n1057\n00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,940\n>> Yep a little bit at least.\n\n1058\n00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,400\nSo, on my computer here,\n\n1059\n00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,750\nwe've got a little diagram that kind of\ncompares them in a very general sense.\n\n1060\n00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,230\nRemember that on all of\nthese operating systems\n\n1061\n00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,140\nreally we're gonna be able to install\nthese regular desktop applications.\n\n1062\n00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,860\nThe ones that are designed for\nus to buy and install,\n\n1063\n00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,560\nusually from a media to be able to do so.\n\n1064\n00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,910\nSo, here we've talked about the creators\nof each of the operating systems.\n\n1065\n00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,520\nRemember that In MAC OS 10 it is\nApple that really has created it and\n\n1066\n00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,940\nthe are the ones that own it and so\n\n1067\n00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,050\nthere's a commercial type of operating\nsystem that we're gonna have.\n\n1068\n00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:48,020\nIt is based on a Unix form,\nthat are called Darwin.\n\n1069\n00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,280\nI haven't worked with Darwin.\n\n1070\n00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,700\nI'm pretty sure that Don has but,\nbut I, I haven't.\n\n1071\n00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,070\nSo, so, Unix Darwin is pretty much\nthe heart of what we see in Mac OS X.\n\n1072\n00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,830\nAnd this is where we pointed out the,\nthe, the processing power, right?\n\n1073\n00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,760\nSo, notice that this one is not really\ndesigned with the ARM processor,\n\n1074\n00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,260\nunlike the IOS that we saw\nwith the earlier Apple iOS.\n\n1075\n00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,190\n>> Keep in mind a few things.\n\n1076\n00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,150\nSo, the, the UNIX Darwin name, all right.\n\n1077\n00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,331\nIf you're a Mac user, you might have\nbeen using a Macs for fifteen years and\n\n1078\n00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:19,553\nhave never heard that term.\n\n1079\n00:50:19,553 --> 00:50:20,846\nSo, so, where does that come from?\n\n1080\n00:50:20,846 --> 00:50:25,401\nWell, under the hood of OS X, right,\ni, if you dig deep down underneath\n\n1081\n00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:30,220\nthe Mac OS there's actually\nsome neat stuff going on there.\n\n1082\n00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,920\nBack in the Macintosh days you had\nMac OS and it was developed by Apple and\n\n1083\n00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,296\nit was a full GUI and, and that was it.\n\n1084\n00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:41,180\nBut in the mid-2000s Apple\ndecided to make a change.\n\n1085\n00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,780\nThat the old OS just wasn't,\n\n1086\n00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,360\nwasn't living up to the networking\noperating systems that were out there.\n\n1087\n00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,190\nSo, they had to find something new.\n\n1088\n00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,120\nAnd so, when version 10 came out, they,\n\n1089\n00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,290\nthey were on Mac OS 9 and I think Mac OS\n9.6 was the last one, if I remember right.\n\n1090\n00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:00,280\nAnd so, when the tenth version came out,\nMac OS 10, instead of doing the number\n\n1091\n00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,160\nten, they decided to do the letter X,\nthe roman numeral for ten.\n\n1092\n00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,990\nAnd so, you hear people say Mac OS 10 or\nMac OSX, it's really the same thing.\n\n1093\n00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,420\nAnd when they made that change,\nwhat they did is they took\n\n1094\n00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,260\nthe UNIX operating system, which is\none we didn't really talk about and\n\n1095\n00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,660\nthat's what they used as their core for\nMAC OS.\n\n1096\n00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,210\nThey actually use, what's it called\nBSD a variant of Unix to do that.\n\n1097\n00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,880\nNow, the UNIX operating system itself\nwas developed at AT&T, Bell Labs.\n\n1098\n00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,136\nAnd it was designed originally\nit's just a proof of concept.\n\n1099\n00:51:31,136 --> 00:51:32,970\nIt was a programmer's OS.\n\n1100\n00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,590\nIt was an operating system that\nhad no graphical user interface.\n\n1101\n00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,340\nThat was all command line.\n\n1102\n00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,179\nAnd you typed programming\nlanguage into it.\n\n1103\n00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:41,886\nAnd it would execute it on command, right?\n\n1104\n00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:43,800\nIt was for programmers.\n\n1105\n00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,770\nDefinitely not end user friendly.\n\n1106\n00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,880\nBut it was super good.\n\n1107\n00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,150\nAt multi tasking.\n\n1108\n00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,680\nAnd it could scale very large.\n\n1109\n00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,820\nIt was extremely reliable.\n\n1110\n00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,160\nAnd so, people made operating\nsystems based on that, and\n\n1111\n00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,840\nthat's where, where BSD came from,\nand in turn, where Mac OS came from.\n\n1112\n00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,553\nSo, Mac OS used that Unix core,\nthat, that Unix-like core.\n\n1113\n00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:08,185\nIt, it's actually built off of BSD,\nbut they used that to pro,\n\n1114\n00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:11,429\nprovide the engine underneath\ntheir operating system.\n\n1115\n00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:15,272\nSo, when you look at the car you see\nthat shiny exterior of that car but\n\n1116\n00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:18,586\ninside it there's an engine and\nwith MAC LS, the operating\n\n1117\n00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:23,780\nsystem we see that's that shiny exterior,\nUNIX is the engine underneath it.\n\n1118\n00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,110\nWith an open source product,\nif a commercial entity uses an open source\n\n1119\n00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:32,700\nproduct they have to release to the public\nany modifications they made to it.\n\n1120\n00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,860\nThey have to,\nto open source it themselves.\n\n1121\n00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,240\nAnd so\nApple does that under the Darwin project.\n\n1122\n00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,190\nAnd so Darwin is actually the\nmodifications that Apple has made to BSD\n\n1123\n00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,350\nas they supported their, their OS.\n\n1124\n00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,230\nAnd so that's where that name comes from.\n\n1125\n00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:51,180\nMost end users don't care about that at\nall you know, if you're a developer you\n\n1126\n00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,990\ndo but otherwise it doesn't matter,\nso you kind of, just ignore it.\n\n1127\n00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,600\nThat's, that's why that's kind of\nan odd thing to creep up there, yeah.\n\n1128\n00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,350\n>> Our next one, of course,\nis Linux from Linus Torvalds himself.\n\n1129\n00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,240\nAnd remember, he developed this\nas he was a college student.\n\n1130\n00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,510\nAnd then,\nopened it to the rest of the world and\n\n1131\n00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:13,290\neverybody has taken off from that point\nand developed their own distros from this.\n\n1132\n00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,230\nSo, it is its own family of of Linux.\n\n1133\n00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,660\nBut it's also a derivative\nof that original UNIX that\n\n1134\n00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,205\nDon was just talking about, too.\n\n1135\n00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:21,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1136\n00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,290\n>> And it operates on 32-bit and\n64-bit CPUs.\n\n1137\n00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,750\nNow, we haven't about that too much,\nDon, have we?\n\n1138\n00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,400\n>> Yeah.\nSo, you know, when you get a, a laptop or,\n\n1139\n00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,580\nor a desktop for that matter,\nit's gonna have memory in it, right?\n\n1140\n00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,920\nIt's gonna have RAM.\n\n1141\n00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,285\nAnd, and we'll talk more about RAM in\nanother episode, but there was this,\n\n1142\n00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:43,580\nthis border that we kind of hit,\nwhich was at four gigabytes of RAM.\n\n1143\n00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,277\nThat for the longest time we\nused 32-bit computing and\n\n1144\n00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:49,520\n32-bit computers could\naccess up to 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n1145\n00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,610\nIf you had more it, it,\nit wouldn't use it and so there were,\n\n1146\n00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,140\nthere were some problems there.\n\n1147\n00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,000\nAnd people found some kind of hackneyed\nways to go ahead and access more memory\n\n1148\n00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,940\nbut finally what they had to do was\nmove the processes up to 64-bit and\n\n1149\n00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,000\nnow they can access way more\nthan four gigabytes of RAM.\n\n1150\n00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,110\nAnd so as computers advanced,\nas we had the need for\n\n1151\n00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,120\nmore memory,\nwe had to move to a 64-bit architecture.\n\n1152\n00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,620\nSo, if you have an OS that's limited to\n32-bit It won't be able to access more\n\n1153\n00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,520\nthan four gigs of ram, but\nif you have a 64 bit system it will.\n\n1154\n00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,980\nAnd, most everybody has made that\nconversion so you'll see each of\n\n1155\n00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,010\nthe operating systems and even Chrome OS\nthere in the end, which is 32-bit.\n\n1156\n00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,230\nThey've released 64-bit versions.\n\n1157\n00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,700\nWe've got David in the chatroom who's\nmentioned that he's got some already.\n\n1158\n00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,175\nSo they started out as 32-bit,\nactually all of these guys started out as\n\n1159\n00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:40,790\n32-bit and\nthen they added 64-bit later on.\n\n1160\n00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,981\nAnd, and that's really become\nprevalent in that last really,\n\n1161\n00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:47,050\nseven to eight years,\nmaybe a little bit longer.\n\n1162\n00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,117\n>> And even recently, I, I can't even\ntell you that I've seen any computer for\n\n1163\n00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:53,136\nsale that's really just 32-bit.\n\n1164\n00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:57,178\nIt's been, you know, a 64-bit, with\na 64-bit operating system built right in.\n\n1165\n00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,000\n>> Yup.\n\n1166\n00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,750\nAnd there's some operating systems\nthat have been 64-bit for a long time.\n\n1167\n00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,670\nI, I used to work on\nSun SparkStation back in the 90s,\n\n1168\n00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:08,390\nthey were 64-bit and they were 64-bit even\nin the 80s, so, it, it's been around and\n\n1169\n00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,420\nwe're seeing general acceptance of it now.\n\n1170\n00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,570\nHeck, even some cellphones are 64-bit now,\n\n1171\n00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:16,830\nwhich is odd because they don't normally\nhave 4 gigs of memory or more but, but\n\n1172\n00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,050\nanyhow it is not stopping\nthe vendors from doing it, so.\n\n1173\n00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,500\nYep.\n\n1174\n00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,360\n>> And the, the, the, the big one\nin the market is still Windows.\n\n1175\n00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Windows,\n\n1176\n00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,440\nof course in any version that you end\nup seeing still operating out there\n\n1177\n00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,420\nall of it of course was\ndeveloped by Microsoft Windows.\n\n1178\n00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,660\nAnd the newer ones are based\noff of the NT family.\n\n1179\n00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,580\nAnd so there, there was a, a point\nin which they, they switched the way\n\n1180\n00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,110\nthat they did things and\nthis is the new heart of, of what they do.\n\n1181\n00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,260\n>> Yeah in the, in the 90s Microsoft\nactually maintained two different\n\n1182\n00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,140\nversions of Windows, one that was\ndesigned for consumers and one that they\n\n1183\n00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,780\ncalled their network operating system,\nit was designed for businesses.\n\n1184\n00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,950\nSo two separate operating systems.\n\n1185\n00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,528\nAnd as the 90s wound down, and we got\ncloser to the, to the new millenia, right?\n\n1186\n00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:02,648\n2000\n>> They merged the two OSs and\n\n1187\n00:56:02,648 --> 00:56:03,446\nI say, merge.\n\n1188\n00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:05,356\nThey really just threw\naway the consumer one and\n\n1189\n00:56:05,356 --> 00:56:07,515\nthe business one became\nthe one that everybody used.\n\n1190\n00:56:07,515 --> 00:56:12,134\nAnd so starting with Windows 2000 and,\nand more so in Windows XP,\n\n1191\n00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:13,556\nyou had this NT core.\n\n1192\n00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:17,932\nThe Windows NT or New Technology, that\nwas the replacement for the old Windows.\n\n1193\n00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:19,515\nThat's where that naming comes from.\n\n1194\n00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:22,880\n>> Yeah, and Windows,\nwe still see the CPU,\n\n1195\n00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,223\nthe central processing unit,\nboth 32-bit and 64-bit.\n\n1196\n00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:32,351\nI remember running the 32-bit of Windows\nXP and so if you're still seeing those,\n\n1197\n00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,265\nyou'll probably see that the majority\nof those are the 32-bit processors.\n\n1198\n00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:41,765\nThen really, beginning with Windows 7,\nI saw more 64-bit coming out in general.\n\n1199\n00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:46,391\nVista was kinda that, that weird one where\nyou had some that would run 32-bit and\n\n1200\n00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,761\n64-bit, but you see it's\nactually supported on both and\n\n1201\n00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:52,890\nthis one is the same way as Apple,\nwhich is commercial.\n\n1202\n00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,615\nSo they're not gonna release the source\ncode for a developer to go ahead and\n\n1203\n00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:56,140\nplay with it.\n\n1204\n00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,246\nYou're gonna have to use\nthere are tools to make your,\n\n1205\n00:56:59,246 --> 00:57:01,348\nyour application to work with.\n\n1206\n00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:04,056\n>> Yep, and then the last one in our\nlist there is just the Chrome OS, right?\n\n1207\n00:57:04,056 --> 00:57:05,489\nWhich we kind of already talked about.\n\n1208\n00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,049\nYou know, it's Google.\n\n1209\n00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,765\nIt is based off of Linux.\n\n1210\n00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:11,890\nGoogle is a search engine company and\nthey make the Chrome web browser.\n\n1211\n00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,634\nThey didn't wanna make a whole\noperating system from scratch, so\n\n1212\n00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:17,723\nthey took the Linux operating system\nhas basically made their own distro.\n\n1213\n00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:22,201\nA distro that was capable of running the\nChrome browser and that's about it, right?\n\n1214\n00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:26,207\nSince it's based on Linux, it has the same\nsupport that Linux does, 32-bit and\n\n1215\n00:57:26,207 --> 00:57:26,848\n64-bit.\n\n1216\n00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:31,770\nBut they've utilized that ARM support,\nbecause Chromebooks normally have\n\n1217\n00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,849\nlower-end hardware in them and\nare trying to be energy efficient.\n\n1218\n00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:40,090\nSo when you buy a Chromebook,\nyou can get it with a standard 32-bit or\n\n1219\n00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:44,050\n64-bit x86 processor or\nyou can get it with an ARM processor,\n\n1220\n00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:48,806\njust depends on the vendor that you buy\nfrom and then it is a commercial one.\n\n1221\n00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:50,915\nThat even though it's built off of Linux,\n\n1222\n00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:54,973\nGoogle does not distribute their source\ncode for their proprietary pieces of it.\n\n1223\n00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:59,623\nThey do release some and that's where the\nchromium open source product comes from,\n\n1224\n00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,598\nbut it's not The same as Chrome OS.\n\n1225\n00:58:01,598 --> 00:58:02,890\nThere's some pretty big differences there.\n\n1226\n00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,140\nAll right.\n\n1227\n00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,898\nWell, Ronnie, that's a pretty good rundown\nof the different operating systems and\n\n1228\n00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:10,056\na good comparison there.\n\n1229\n00:58:10,056 --> 00:58:14,290\nLet's stop and take a break and when we\nget back, we've got some other bits and\n\n1230\n00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,946\npieces we need to tackle as we look\nat some of the other attributes and\n\n1231\n00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:20,723\ncharacteristics of\na standard operating system.\n\n1232\n00:58:20,723 --> 00:58:23,098\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1233\n00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:31,140\n[MUSIC]\n\n1234\n00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:31,640\nAll right.\n\n1235\n00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,723\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1236\n00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:36,410\nSo for the last part of the episode, what\nwe wanna do is take a look at some general\n\n1237\n00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,515\ncharacteristics about operating systems.\n\n1238\n00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,709\nNot, not necessarily one OS in particular\nanymore, but just some of the general\n\n1239\n00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:45,681\nthings that we need to be aware\nof as we take a look at them.\n\n1240\n00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:50,199\nAnd one of the first things we need to\nbe aware of is the compatibility of\n\n1241\n00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,223\napplications.\n\n1242\n00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:54,389\nAn application, that's a program\nthat we use to perform an action.\n\n1243\n00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:57,348\nIn the last segment, I fired up some word\nprocessors and some web browsers, right?\n\n1244\n00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,765\nThose are applications.\n\n1245\n00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:03,681\nWell, not every application is\ncompatible with every operating system.\n\n1246\n00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:08,631\nSo, if you're running Linux or\nMac OS or Windows, you need to get\n\n1247\n00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:14,041\napplications that are designed for\nLenox, Mac OS or Windows, right?\n\n1248\n00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,348\nFor the operating system\nthat you're running.\n\n1249\n00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:17,015\nThere's no one size fits all.\n\n1250\n00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:20,640\nThey they call that\ncross platform support.\n\n1251\n00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,980\nIf there's a program that will run on more\nthan one operating system, then they say\n\n1252\n00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,140\nthat is across platform and there's very\nfew applications that are like that.\n\n1253\n00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,548\nInstead, when you go to\nfind an application,\n\n1254\n00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:34,098\nyou'll often find ones\nthat only work on one OS.\n\n1255\n00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:39,079\nOr when they have more than one\nversion of the same application,\n\n1256\n00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,931\none design for each OS.\n\n1257\n00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:45,494\nIt, it's very rare that you find just one\nprogram by itself that will automatically\n\n1258\n00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:46,598\nrun on the various.\n\n1259\n00:59:46,598 --> 00:59:48,848\nIt's not impossible, but\nit's very, very rare.\n\n1260\n00:59:48,848 --> 00:59:50,806\n>> Yeah, we have an example\nof what we're talking about.\n\n1261\n00:59:50,806 --> 00:59:53,791\nAn so, if we go to my computer,\nI went ahead and\n\n1262\n00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:58,473\nlaunched up the diagram tool that I\nend up using called simple diagrams.\n\n1263\n00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:01,633\nAnd just on most websites that you go to,\nif you're not sure about what\n\n1264\n01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:05,197\nplatform that you need or, or what you're\nlooking for, you're gonna take a look at\n\n1265\n01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:08,890\nyour operation system and you're gonna\nsay, hey, that's the one I'm looking for.\n\n1266\n01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:13,107\nBut here on this page, I have a download\nlink at the top of the page that I can\n\n1267\n01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:16,781\nsimply click on and here's what\nDon was mentioning right here on\n\n1268\n01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,932\nthe left-hand side where it says,\ncurrent version.\n\n1269\n01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:23,890\nYou see that there's different installers\nfor the different operating systems.\n\n1270\n01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,962\nSo the first one is really designed for\n\n1271\n01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:29,588\nthose of us that are running Windows and\non this application,\n\n1272\n01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:33,765\nyou can see where it's designed for\nWindows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8.\n\n1273\n01:00:33,765 --> 01:00:35,890\nNow you might have to be careful here.\n\n1274\n01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,306\nSometimes, you end up even\ndownloading the wrong version.\n\n1275\n01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:43,866\nSo, it might be that I pull down Windows\nXP and download and try to install it, but\n\n1276\n01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:46,431\nI'm on Windows 8.1 and it might not work.\n\n1277\n01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:47,056\nAll right?\n\n1278\n01:00:47,056 --> 01:00:50,515\nSo you do have this possibility where you,\nwhere you might do that.\n\n1279\n01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:54,325\nBut if you're running Mac OS 10,\nthey have a separate installer and\n\n1280\n01:00:54,325 --> 01:00:56,015\nwe even have one for Adobe AIR.\n\n1281\n01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:57,015\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Don, isn't that cool?\n\n1282\n01:00:57,015 --> 01:01:00,191\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm gonna go really crazy you know,\n\n1283\n01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:04,806\nit, one that, that pops to mind\nis like WinRAR, it's an archiver.\n\n1284\n01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:08,560\nAnd when you go their page, they had\nthis gigantic list of like 20 different\n\n1285\n01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,431\nsoftware packages you can download.\n\n1286\n01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:13,204\nI think 7-Zip might even be the same way,\nbut, but\n\n1287\n01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:16,734\nthere's a few different ones where\nthey give you this huge list and\n\n1288\n01:01:16,734 --> 01:01:20,598\nthey're just trying to support as\nmany operating systems as possible.\n\n1289\n01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:21,640\nSo you just have to make\nsure you pick the right one.\n\n1290\n01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,098\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, look at that one there.\n\n1291\n01:01:23,098 --> 01:01:27,140\nWhere you've got all these different\nversions of Windows and and\n\n1292\n01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,556\nyou'll see different processors and\ndifferent variations.\n\n1293\n01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:32,015\nSo you're just looking pretty good.\n\n1294\n01:01:32,015 --> 01:01:36,306\nThere's a 32-bit version of windows,\n64-bit version of windows and so on.\n\n1295\n01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:39,377\nSo you may see a ton of selection\nyou've got to be able to know\n\n1296\n01:01:39,377 --> 01:01:42,890\nwhat your operating system is to\nknow that you picked the right one.\n\n1297\n01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,601\nYeah, there's, there's even more like\nlittle zip packages for FreeBSD,\n\n1298\n01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:48,431\nMac OS, BOS.\n\n1299\n01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:50,431\nBoy, that isn't even around anymore.\n\n1300\n01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:53,113\nWell, I guess DOS,\nthat's not around anymore either.\n\n1301\n01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:53,613\nAmiga.\n>> Amiga.\n\n1302\n01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:54,153\n>> This is like\n\n1303\n01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:56,411\na graveyard of operating systems,\nisn't it?\n\n1304\n01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:57,598\nAIX, that's still around.\n\n1305\n01:01:57,598 --> 01:01:59,431\n[LAUGH] So, so there, there's that.\n\n1306\n01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:01,714\n[LAUGH] So, so basically you, you know,\n\n1307\n01:02:01,714 --> 01:02:04,431\nfind the one that matches up\nwith the OS that you need.\n\n1308\n01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:07,537\n>> Yeah, and make sure you pick that one,\nbecause that's probably designed for\n\n1309\n01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:10,515\nthe best compatibility for the operating\nsystem that you're running on.\n\n1310\n01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:13,239\nYou may try the other ones and\nthey may work, but usually,\n\n1311\n01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:15,806\npicking the right one for\nthe right operating system.\n\n1312\n01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:19,971\nThat's where you want to go to make sure\nthat you have the true compatibility that\n\n1313\n01:02:19,971 --> 01:02:22,556\nyou need and run that that application.\n\n1314\n01:02:22,556 --> 01:02:24,223\n>> Now here's where things\nget really confusing.\n\n1315\n01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:25,391\nRonnie, scroll backup on this one.\n\n1316\n01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:26,473\n>> Sure thing.\n\n1317\n01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:29,973\n>> There's 32-bit and\n64-bit versions of this software.\n\n1318\n01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:30,515\nAll right.\n\n1319\n01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:31,640\nSometimes, you don't have that.\n\n1320\n01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,881\nDo you still have Simple Diagrams?\n\n1321\n01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:34,056\n>> I do.\n>> Pulled up?\n\n1322\n01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:37,473\nOn Simple Diagrams, see how there's\none downloader for Windows up there?\n\n1323\n01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:41,271\nIt says, Simple Diagrams installer and\nthat's the one for Windows and\n\n1324\n01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:43,307\nit doesn't say, 32 or 64-bit.\n\n1325\n01:02:43,307 --> 01:02:48,098\nA lot of vendors will do that, they'll\npackage both in the same installer.\n\n1326\n01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,223\n>> And so when it installs,\nit'll check your computer.\n\n1327\n01:02:50,223 --> 01:02:54,515\nAnd say, hey, if this is a 64 bit system,\nI'll in, install the 64-bit version.\n\n1328\n01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:56,973\nIf it's a 32-bit system,\nwe'll just do the 32 bit.\n\n1329\n01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,473\nAll right.\n\n1330\n01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,241\nNow so\nthat happens automatically sometimes, but\n\n1331\n01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:02,181\nthat's not the case with 7-Zip.\n\n1332\n01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:04,473\nOn this one, we've got to know.\n\n1333\n01:03:04,473 --> 01:03:05,223\nSe how we've got, right?\n\n1334\n01:03:05,223 --> 01:03:08,535\nThere, the 32-bit version of Windows and\nright beneath it is 64-bit, but\n\n1335\n01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,765\nthere's no double package.\n\n1336\n01:03:09,765 --> 01:03:11,806\nThere's no combination.\n\n1337\n01:03:11,806 --> 01:03:13,182\nSo you got to pick the right one.\n\n1338\n01:03:13,182 --> 01:03:18,051\nAnd what makes it confusing\nis that a 64-bit system can\n\n1339\n01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:22,616\nrun both 32 and 64-bit app,\napplications, but\n\n1340\n01:03:22,616 --> 01:03:28,515\na 32-bit operating system can\nonly run 32-bit applications.\n\n1341\n01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:32,166\nSo, if you don't know whether you're 32 or\n64-bit,\n\n1342\n01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:35,973\nyou could just grab the 32 bit one,\ncuz it will work on both.\n\n1343\n01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:39,848\nBut if you grab the 64-bit one and\nyou're on a 32-bit system, it won't run.\n\n1344\n01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:41,931\nYou know, it's not compatible.\n\n1345\n01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:46,294\nBut when you run a 32-bit\napplication on a 64-bit OS,\n\n1346\n01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:49,530\nthat old 4 gig memory\nlimit is still there.\n\n1347\n01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,276\nSo that application that you're running\nis now limited to only 4 gigs of RAM,\n\n1348\n01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:55,221\neven though you may have far, far more.\n\n1349\n01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:58,360\nNow most applications don't need\nthat much memory, so we don't care.\n\n1350\n01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,613\nOn something like 7-Zip we,\nwe really don't care.\n\n1351\n01:04:00,613 --> 01:04:04,210\nBut but on other applications like\ndatabases we, we really do care.\n\n1352\n01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,420\nYou need as much memory as you can get for\nthose and\n\n1353\n01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,705\nyou've gotta make sure you\npick the right architecture.\n\n1354\n01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:09,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n1355\n01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,500\nThe nice thing about some\nof these newer sites like,\n\n1356\n01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,930\nlike the one here on SimpleDiagrams is\nthat, that they give you this nice little\n\n1357\n01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:19,350\nparagraph down, right down here at\nthe bottom, which installer should I use?\n\n1358\n01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:23,870\nSo, if you're ever not sure check for\nmore details and documentation.\n\n1359\n01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,100\nDon't just assume.\n\n1360\n01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,785\nMake sure you know what you're running and\nthen if you're not sure, there it goes.\n\n1361\n01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,915\nSo, so they do tend to provide a little\nbit more information to help us out.\n\n1362\n01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:33,566\n7-Zip, not so much so.\n\n1363\n01:04:33,566 --> 01:04:34,576\n>> Man.\nOn, on their site, but\n\n1364\n01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:36,932\nthey're probably expecting\nthat if you're ready here,\n\n1365\n01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:38,725\nyou probably know which\none you want to run.\n\n1366\n01:04:39,865 --> 01:04:42,715\n>> Yeah, now,\nhow do you know if you're running\n\n1367\n01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,425\na 64-bit operating system or not, right?\n\n1368\n01:04:44,425 --> 01:04:45,975\nHow do we know what, what it is?\n\n1369\n01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:50,415\nWell, it's usually specifically stated on\nthe operating system installation media.\n\n1370\n01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:53,840\nSo, when you bought a computer, if you got\ninstallation disks, it'll say it on there.\n\n1371\n01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,630\nBut more and more vendors are not\nproviding those installation discs.\n\n1372\n01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:57,890\nIt's really frustrating.\n\n1373\n01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:00,740\nSo, typically,\nin the operating system somewhere,\n\n1374\n01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,030\nyou'll be able to pull up\na system status screen.\n\n1375\n01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,660\nLike an,\nan about my operating system screen.\n\n1376\n01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,510\nOn Windows, it's through\nthe system control panel here.\n\n1377\n01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:12,720\nOn Mac OS, there's a little Apple\nmenu at the top you can click on, and\n\n1378\n01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,480\nthere's a About This Mac link you can hit.\n\n1379\n01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,540\nEither way they displayed\nscreens like this and\n\n1380\n01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,880\nthey'll tell you whether you're 64-bit or\nnot.\n\n1381\n01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,460\nSo Ronnie, you are 64-bit.\n\n1382\n01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,550\n>> I am.\n\n1383\n01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,160\n>> Congratulations!\n\n1384\n01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,720\n>> Thank you.\n>> [LAUGH] It, it was,\n\n1385\n01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,040\npretty easy jus, just to guess that even\nif it didn't tell us cause you got 8 gigs\n\n1386\n01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,840\nof RAM in his computer and a 32-bit\nsystem wouldn't be able to use that.\n\n1387\n01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,610\nSo, he's got a 64 gig,\nexcuse me, a 64-bit system so\n\n1388\n01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,480\nthat's the version of\n7-Zip he should download.\n\n1389\n01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,870\nAll right, so\nkeep that in mind as you go through and\n\n1390\n01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,770\nstart to work with applications and\nwe'll talk more about applications later.\n\n1391\n01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,188\nAll right,\nwhat else is on our laundry list here?\n\n1392\n01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:51,999\nOh, so, we talked a little bit about\ndifferent hardware that can be used with\n\n1393\n01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:53,340\noperating systems.\n\n1394\n01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,960\nIf you, maybe you, you're watching this\nshow, and you just heard about one of\n\n1395\n01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,985\nthese new OS's, and you say boy,\nI, I really wanna try Linux, or\n\n1396\n01:05:59,985 --> 01:06:03,012\nI really wanna try Windows 8, or\nI really wanna try Mac OS, well,\n\n1397\n01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:06,730\nthey have a hardware requirement\nthat's associated with them, right?\n\n1398\n01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,600\nIn order to run that operating system,\n\n1399\n01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,580\nyour hardware has to meet\ncertain specifications.\n\n1400\n01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,740\nApple's the easiest.\n\n1401\n01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,250\nIf you wanna run their operating system,\nyour hardware has to be from Apple, right?\n\n1402\n01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,269\nThat's it.\n[LAUGH] And,\n\n1403\n01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,107\nif you buy your hardware from Apple,\n\n1404\n01:06:19,107 --> 01:06:22,960\nyou'll be able to run Mac OS but with each\nnew version of Mac OS that comes out,\n\n1405\n01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,760\nthey have hardware requirements you\nhave to meet to be able to run it.\n\n1406\n01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,300\nSo, you might be limited to running\nan older version of MAC OS because\n\n1407\n01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,415\nyour hardware is not good enough\nto meet the requirements.\n\n1408\n01:06:33,415 --> 01:06:37,525\nSo, when you select an operating system\nbefore you select your hardware you\n\n1409\n01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:40,855\nshould always take a look at what's\ncalled the minimum requirements.\n\n1410\n01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:41,875\nThat's the hardware that you've\n\n1411\n01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,985\ngot to have to run\nthe operating system helpfully.\n\n1412\n01:06:45,045 --> 01:06:47,435\nNow, just a word of advice,\nyou never want the minimum.\n\n1413\n01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,535\nAll right, even if you're dead broke and\n\n1414\n01:06:49,535 --> 01:06:51,895\nscraping pennies together\nto get a computer.\n\n1415\n01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:53,650\nIf you get the minimum,\n\n1416\n01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:57,080\nthat means that that hardware will be\nable to run your operating system and\n\n1417\n01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:01,020\nit will run okay but the instant you\nlaunch a single application, you've now\n\n1418\n01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,080\nmoved beyond the operating system and\nnow your performance is gonna drag.\n\n1419\n01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,610\nAnd, so if you have the minimum\nrequirements, you'll have a very,\n\n1420\n01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:08,820\nvery poor experience.\n\n1421\n01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,050\nYou will not be happy\nabout that computer so\n\n1422\n01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:14,390\nyou always need to exceed\nthe minimum recommendation.\n\n1423\n01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,950\nDon't, don't just hit minimums.\n\n1424\n01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:21,680\n>> So, as an example, I've pulled up the\nWindows 8.1 system requirements, hardware\n\n1425\n01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,270\nminimum requirements so that we can see\nthat if I wanted to choose to run Windows\n\n1426\n01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:31,220\n8.1, I simply went in to my browser and I\ntyped in minimum hardware requirements for\n\n1427\n01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,330\ninstalling Windows 8.1 and it brought\nme up to several different links but\n\n1428\n01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,600\nI picked the official one from Microsoft.\n\n1429\n01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,240\nAnd so, right here you can see where for\n\n1430\n01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,920\nWindows 8.1 to run that on a PC here\nis what I would minimally need.\n\n1431\n01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,150\nSo the processor, it, it tells me\nat least a gigahertz or faster, and\n\n1432\n01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,370\nit even has some other information here.\n\n1433\n01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:54,320\nWe also see that at\nleast a gigabyte of RAM.\n\n1434\n01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:00,810\nNow here they differentiate between 32-bit\nand 64-bit for the installation process.\n\n1435\n01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,330\nIf you start to try and\ninstall a 64-bit operating system and\n\n1436\n01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,415\nyou only have one gig of RAM,\nit's not only gonna not work,\n\n1437\n01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:11,281\nit's gonna tell you, you don't meet\nthe minimum requirements to do so.\n\n1438\n01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:13,208\nSo, that's something that\nyou've got to realize.\n\n1439\n01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:16,075\nAnd then, of course,\nthe same thing with hard drive space,\n\n1440\n01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:18,960\nmaking sure that we have enough\navailable hard drive space.\n\n1441\n01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,061\nThere's another one.\nAnd then of course, the graphics,\n\n1442\n01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:24,200\nbecause we're gonna run\na graphical user environment, the,\n\n1443\n01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,110\nthe user interface that we've been talking\nabout throughout this whole episode and\n\n1444\n01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,562\nit needs to be able to display.\n\n1445\n01:08:29,562 --> 01:08:33,590\nIf we don't have that, it may not work\nthe way that we expect it to work.\n\n1446\n01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:37,601\nSo, every system will have some type\nof minimum requirement to make sure\n\n1447\n01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:41,297\nthat you get the experience that\nyou want to, to, to get out of it.\n\n1448\n01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:45,638\nI remember when, when vista first came out\nand I was taking with this little video\n\n1449\n01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:49,015\nwhere, where they we're talking\nabout internally, inside of,\n\n1450\n01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:53,236\nof Windows and they were saying, here's\nthe minimum requirements for Vista and\n\n1451\n01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:57,552\nyou heard people at Microsoft chuckling\nabout the minimum requirements for Vista.\n\n1452\n01:08:57,552 --> 01:09:00,441\nAnd you were like, wait a minute,\nthey're doing this to their own system?\n\n1453\n01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:02,611\nThey're saying there's the minimum, but\n\n1454\n01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:04,963\nnobody ever wants to\ninstall just the minimum.\n\n1455\n01:09:04,963 --> 01:09:08,249\nAnd so, so sometimes you also see\nnot only the minimum requirements,\n\n1456\n01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:11,660\nyou also see in parentheses where\nthey talk about recommended.\n\n1457\n01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,389\nAnd that's probably the, the minimum\nthat you really want on your system.\n\n1458\n01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:17,079\n>> Yeah, if you look at these\nminimum requirements, fortunately,\n\n1459\n01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:19,973\nyou'd be pretty hard pressed to buy\na computer with these specs today.\n\n1460\n01:09:19,973 --> 01:09:21,291\n>> Right\n>> You know,\n\n1461\n01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:25,338\nIf you walk into an electronic store I\ndoubt you'd be able to get a system that\n\n1462\n01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:27,930\nwas slower than like 1.7 gigahertz.\n\n1463\n01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,050\nI'd really don't think you could find\na system with only a gigabyte of RAM.\n\n1464\n01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:35,450\nI think most systems are gonna\nhave 3 gigs or more right now.\n\n1465\n01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:39,880\nOn a hard drive space you can't buy\na hard drive under 250 gigs, in, in,\n\n1466\n01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,060\nin most cases,\nunless you start going solid state.\n\n1467\n01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,720\nSo, most,\nmost drives are gonna be bigger than that,\n\n1468\n01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:48,060\nand the graphics card is pretty standard,\nDirectX 9, but up to DirectX 11 now,\n\n1469\n01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,260\nso this is an older standard that,\nthat Microsoft has.\n\n1470\n01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,220\nSo, these, these are not hard\nnumber to hit, all right?\n\n1471\n01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,990\nAnd with Microsoft especially,\n\n1472\n01:09:56,990 --> 01:10:00,700\nwhat they wanna do is they wanna\nkeep your old computers running.\n\n1473\n01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,990\nThey designed this for for\na lot of businesses, not just individuals.\n\n1474\n01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:07,230\nAnd businesses don't necessarily buy\nnew computers every couple of years\n\n1475\n01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,600\nlike you might for your,\nyour personal system.\n\n1476\n01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,790\nSo they need to last longer if they're\ngonna run these newer OSs, all right.\n\n1477\n01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,980\nBut every operating system has it.\n\n1478\n01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,230\nIf you go and get a Linux distribution,\nLinux distributions are known for\n\n1479\n01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,770\nbeing extremely low resource intensive.\n\n1480\n01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,449\nLinux will run on very old computers and\nit'll run great.\n\n1481\n01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:27,115\nSo, if you've got an old\nsystem kicking around and\n\n1482\n01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:31,083\nWindows is too slow on it, you could\nfire up something like Ubuntu Linux\n\n1483\n01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:35,117\nwhich is what Ronnie's pulling up right\nnow and look at those requirements.\n\n1484\n01:10:35,117 --> 01:10:37,240\n700 MHz processor, right?\n\n1485\n01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,440\nThat's not even 1 GHz.\n\n1486\n01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,785\n1 GHz is, is a 1000 MHz.\n\n1487\n01:10:40,785 --> 01:10:43,410\n512 megs of memory,\n5 gigs of hard drive space.\n\n1488\n01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:47,820\nThese are basically half the specs\nof what we saw for Windows 8.\n\n1489\n01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,153\nSo it'll run on older,\nlower end computers.\n\n1490\n01:10:51,153 --> 01:10:53,892\nAnd MAC OS is the same way\nI think if you look for\n\n1491\n01:10:53,892 --> 01:10:58,590\nlike Yosemite hardware requirements,\nexcept because it's proprietary to Apple,\n\n1492\n01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:01,609\nthey usually just list the laptop and\ndesktop models.\n\n1493\n01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:04,320\nSo they're saying if you have this model,\nthis model, this model,\n\n1494\n01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,441\nyou can upgrade and\nif you don't you, you can't so.\n\n1495\n01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:08,206\nLet's see something about icon.\n\n1496\n01:11:08,206 --> 01:11:11,240\n>> I was gonna say that's not\nthe official one I was looking for.\n\n1497\n01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,003\nMac World UK.\n\n1498\n01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:15,999\n>> I don't see\n>> It might be right there on the, oh,\n\n1499\n01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:17,769\nright, right there oh,\nup there at the top,\n\n1500\n01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:20,490\nif if you go to the\n>> That one?\n\n1501\n01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,360\n>> No, the, the,\nthe OSX one down two more links.\n\n1502\n01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,108\n>> There.\n>> Oh, there ya go.\n\n1503\n01:11:25,108 --> 01:11:26,823\n>> I didn't see that.\n>> That's the main page and\n\n1504\n01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:31,676\nthen they should have a link on there that\nlet's you see, do the How to Upgrade one,\n\n1505\n01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:35,370\nup at the top right, and\nthat should have the, the requirements.\n\n1506\n01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,530\nHere we go.\nNow, you know, with, with Mac OS,\n\n1507\n01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:45,150\nit's distributed with their hardware,\nso they usually don't charge for it.\n\n1508\n01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,030\nIf you want the newer version, it's free.\n\n1509\n01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,580\nYou just go and update, and so\nthat's what it's saying here.\n\n1510\n01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,091\nAnd see how they list, what's compatible?\n\n1511\n01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:56,403\nSo, if you wanna run the newest\nOS X You need to have\n\n1512\n01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:59,495\nan iMac from mid 2007 or newer.\n\n1513\n01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:03,980\nSo they're really saying that just about\nany system they've sold since 2007 can run\n\n1514\n01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,090\nthis latest OS.\n\n1515\n01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,490\nBut if you have an older one,\nsomething from before there,\n\n1516\n01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,500\nthen you're not gonna be able to upgrade,\nright?\n\n1517\n01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,280\nSo they list it this way just\nbecause they control the hardware.\n\n1518\n01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,931\nThey don't have to say the processor and\nall that stuff.\n\n1519\n01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:17,870\nThey already know it.\n\n1520\n01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:18,730\n>> Oh, general requirements.\n\n1521\n01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,330\nThere you go.\n>> There you go.\n\n1522\n01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:23,235\nTwo gigs of memory,\neight gigs of available storage.\n\n1523\n01:12:23,235 --> 01:12:26,596\nSo a little bit higher on\nthe memory demands there.\n\n1524\n01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:30,840\nThey do have that minimum of OS 10.6 and\nthis is now 10.10.\n\n1525\n01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,240\nSo they don't support a direct\nupgrade from an earlier version.\n\n1526\n01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:35,970\nThose are basically it.\n\n1527\n01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:36,530\nSo.\n\n1528\n01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:37,940\nEvery operating system has that.\n\n1529\n01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,700\nEvery operating system\nhas minimum requirements.\n\n1530\n01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,300\nYou just need to make sure you meet them.\n\n1531\n01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,940\nIf you don't,\nyour user experience will be very poor.\n\n1532\n01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,210\nAnd there's nothing more\nfrustrating than a slow computer.\n\n1533\n01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,970\nThat'll really get on my nerves, I know.\n\n1534\n01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mine too.\n\n1535\n01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:52,960\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n1536\n01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,060\nSo so let, let's recap this.\n\n1537\n01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,624\nAll right?\nI,\n\n1538\n01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:59,084\nin this segment we got a chance to\ntake a look at operating systems.\n\n1539\n01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,750\nAnd we discussed several different ones,\nright?\n\n1540\n01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,970\nI think we did about eight different\noperating systems out there.\n\n1541\n01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,570\nBut there are literally\nhundreds of OS's out there.\n\n1542\n01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:08,346\nWe just covered the big names,\nin, in computing.\n\n1543\n01:13:08,346 --> 01:13:11,800\nSo, wh-, you know,\nwhat's such a big deal about\n\n1544\n01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,260\nthese operating systems is that they, they\nhandle how we interact with the computer.\n\n1545\n01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,110\nThey are what most of us think\nof our computer, you know.\n\n1546\n01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,770\nAnd depending on the operating\nsystem you're using,\n\n1547\n01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,940\nyou can have a very different\nexperience from someone else,\n\n1548\n01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,890\njust based on the user interfaces\nbeing provided to you.\n\n1549\n01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,520\n>> Right.\n\n1550\n01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,431\nThe operating system, remember,\n\n1551\n01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:33,454\nreally does handle the interaction that\nwe have as humans to the hardware.\n\n1552\n01:13:33,454 --> 01:13:37,590\nAs well as to the applications\nthat we want to run.\n\n1553\n01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,010\nWell, if we don't have\nan operating system,\n\n1554\n01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,050\nthere's no place to run\nthose applications.\n\n1555\n01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:46,574\nAnd of course, we also have to realize\nthat even if we have different hardware\n\n1556\n01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:48,160\nattached to that computer.\n\n1557\n01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,959\nThey won't be able to interact if we don't\nhave an operating system that can help us\n\n1558\n01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:54,730\nto, to be able to use\nthose different devices.\n\n1559\n01:13:54,730 --> 01:14:00,340\nSo by far, this is the most important\npiece of software that we're going to run.\n\n1560\n01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,300\nAnd depending on the device, whether\nwe're going to use the mobile OS or\n\n1561\n01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,890\na work station type of operating system,\nis what we're to have to choose.\n\n1562\n01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:11,270\nAnd you'll actually see all these\nthat we mentioned somewhere out there\n\n1563\n01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,480\nas you are doing support.\n\n1564\n01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,500\n>> So, some of the other things\nthat operating systems do,\n\n1565\n01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,210\nwhen you hook up external hardware,\nthings like printers and scanners.\n\n1566\n01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,970\nThey're the ones that handle\nthe communication with that.\n\n1567\n01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,060\nSo any special software needed for\nthat equipment,\n\n1568\n01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,510\nit's the operating system that deals\nwith that so that you don't have to.\n\n1569\n01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,550\nOther things are file structures,\n\n1570\n01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,420\nhow we store our files on a hard drive,\nthe operating system is managing that.\n\n1571\n01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,700\nDifferent OS's store files,\n\n1572\n01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,485\ndifferent ways, but\nall of them are kind of the same.\n\n1573\n01:14:37,485 --> 01:14:39,600\nIn that they, they store your\nfiles on the drive, and then,\n\n1574\n01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,650\nthey retrieve the files\nwhen you want them.\n\n1575\n01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,660\nThese are important things things\na lot of us take for granted.\n\n1576\n01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,610\nWe, we don't even consider throughout the,\nthe business of the day,\n\n1577\n01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,830\nbut your operating system\nis specializing in that.\n\n1578\n01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:54,060\nSo that is obviously a critical\npiece of your computing experience.\n\n1579\n01:14:55,132 --> 01:14:58,050\nAll right, I think we've covered\nthis one pretty well in depth, so\n\n1580\n01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,660\nwe'll probably wrap it up here.\n\n1581\n01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,640\nLet me just remind you guys,\n\n1582\n01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,760\nif you have any questions on any of this,\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1583\n01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,820\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1584\n01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:09,569\nyou'll see the chat

right, good morning, good afternoon\nand good evening and welcome back!\n\n5\n00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,610\nTo another episode of IT ProTV, I'm your\nhost Don Pezet back with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,330\nHow's it going Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,839\n>> It is going well today we are,\nare ready for\n\n8\n00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,576\nour second jump in to the realm of IT\nfundamentals and we're looking for\n\n9\n00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:53,770\na good time in taking with\nthe applications and software.\n\n10\n00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,220\n>> Now, in our first episode\nwe covered operating systems\n\n11\n00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,500\nwhich is that basic interface between\nyou and your computer hardware.\n\n12\n00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,088\nNow we're gonna take a look at software,\nand software, man, is it a big, big field.\n\n13\n00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:09,240\nIn fact, CompTIA gives us this\nnice little list that is just,\n\n14\n00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,330\nI mean, it's massive,\nthis is all we're gonna be talking about.\n\n15\n00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,200\nOf, of all the different software\nyou can add to your computer.\n\n16\n00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,070\nSo what, why would we do that?\n\n17\n00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,950\nWell most modern operating systems,\nwhile they're very powerful and\n\n18\n00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,890\nthey do a lot of things, they don't\nnecessarily do exactly what we want.\n\n19\n00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,550\nEverybody uses a computer\na little bit differently.\n\n20\n00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,340\nAnd so frequently, we'll need specialized\napplications, programs, software, right?\n\n21\n00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,750\nThat does something specific\nto what I want, all right.\n\n22\n00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,450\nSo depending on your job type or\nhow you use your computer at home,\n\n23\n00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,300\nyou'll have different needs for programs.\n\n24\n00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,440\nAnd it's very rarely that you'll find\ntwo people with the exact same needs, so\n\n25\n00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,570\npeople usually have this mixture\nof software that they prefer.\n\n26\n00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,180\nThat all achieves some\ncertain kind of goal.\n\n27\n00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,340\nSo we're gonna run down that list and\nlook at all the different software types.\n\n28\n00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,310\nBut I shouldn't say all, right?\n\n29\n00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,420\nWe're gonna look at the, the main ones and\nidentify some of the different programs\n\n30\n00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,130\nthat are out there that you may or\nmay not use.\n\n31\n00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,670\nAll right.\n\n32\n00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,350\nAll, all just trying to familiarize you\nwith the different types of software\n\n33\n00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,890\nthat's available.\n\n34\n00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,880\nNow before we get into that, understand\nthat programs can take a few different\n\n35\n00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,060\nforms, and things are getting really\ndifferent today than they were ten years\n\n36\n00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,820\nago, and it's because of all the different\nways that we can consume our data.\n\n37\n00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,230\nFor example in, in the old days, if you\nwanted to program, right, maybe, maybe you\n\n38\n00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,850\nhad a store, and you sold things, so\nyou needed a cash register program, right.\n\n39\n00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,420\nWell you'd go out and buy that software,\nyou'd install it right here on your\n\n40\n00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,590\ncomputer, and you'd run it on the\ncomputer, and whenever you wanted to sell\n\n41\n00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,500\nsomething, you'd go in that software,\nand punch it in.\n\n42\n00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,290\nRight.\n\n43\n00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,880\nThat was a standard\ndesktop style application.\n\n44\n00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,490\nRight from your system.\n\n45\n00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,600\nAnd, and that's what most of think\nabout when we think of software, right?\n\n46\n00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,260\nBut in today's world,\nthere's a few other types.\n\n47\n00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,340\nFor example, there's mobile applications.\n\n48\n00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,180\nWe might have a smartphone or a tablet.\n\n49\n00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,620\nAnd those things come with\nvery few applications on it.\n\n50\n00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,880\nThey usually have a PDA, like Personal\nDigital Assistant stuff, a calendar,\n\n51\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,470\na to-do list, a clock, that kind of thing.\n\n52\n00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,375\nBut you might want something else on there\na specialized web browser or for me, I,\n\n53\n00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:16,305\nI read constantly and so I have a program\nthat I use to read e-books and I have\n\n54\n00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:20,247\nanother program that reads out loud to me,\nso I can listen while I'm in the car.\n\n55\n00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,507\nThat doesn't mean come built\ninto my mobile devices.\n\n56\n00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,707\nI had to get that application,\nI had to get that software to use it.\n\n57\n00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,777\nBut that's different than the software\nI might run on the desktop.\n\n58\n00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:29,797\nThey're not compatible,\n\n59\n00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:33,677\nI have to get different applications\nto do that same thing from my desktop.\n\n60\n00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:36,757\nBut I don't need something that can\nread aloud to me on my desktop,\n\n61\n00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,677\nbecause I could just look at it and\nwatch it.\n\n62\n00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,687\nI need something to read aloud to me on\nmy phone because I use it in the car and\n\n63\n00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,560\nI don't wanna look at my\nphone while I'm driving.\n\n64\n00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,010\nThat's a great way to have a bad day.\n\n65\n00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,838\n>> We also have what we call\nweb-based applications too.\n\n66\n00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:53,330\nWeb-based applications allow us to,\n\n67\n00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,200\nto not have to worry about really\na lot of hardware requirements.\n\n68\n00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,170\nAll we need is the web browser\nto be able to connect and\n\n69\n00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,080\nto be able to find\ninformation that we need.\n\n70\n00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,960\nAnd to be able to have some of\nthe different things that we want\n\n71\n00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,740\nwithout having a lot of, of hefty hardware\nrequirements at, at one end or, or\n\n72\n00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,320\nat least at our end.\n\n73\n00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,940\nSo that what we do is we off load\neverything back up to whatever device that\n\n74\n00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,590\nwe're connecting to.\n\n75\n00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,390\nAnd this makes it very easy.\n\n76\n00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,940\nCause now we can control what, what our\ncompany wants to release out there.\n\n77\n00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,930\nAnd we can only give a portal for\npeople to access.\n\n78\n00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,770\n>> Web based software is\nreally the way of the future.\n\n79\n00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,940\nAnd so you're seeing many, many companies\nmove their software over to web based.\n\n80\n00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,330\nIt has a lot of advantages to it.\n\n81\n00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,020\nAll right.\n\n82\n00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,480\nLet me, let me give you\nan example with me and email.\n\n83\n00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,850\nSo for\nyears I used email software on my laptop.\n\n84\n00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,142\nAnd so when I was on my laptop, I could\nfire up my software, get into my email,\n\n85\n00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,727\ndo my responses, and so on, right?\n\n86\n00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:46,090\nBut as an IT worker I,\nI jump around computers a lot.\n\n87\n00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,350\nSo I might not be at my computer,\nI might be at somebody else's, and\n\n88\n00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,970\nif I'm at their computer,\nI can't get into my email.\n\n89\n00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,600\nThey might not have\nthe client that I have,\n\n90\n00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,560\nthey might not have that same software.\n\n91\n00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,730\nSo that's a bit of a headache is I have\nto have that software available on\n\n92\n00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,800\nany machine that I might use.\n\n93\n00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,720\nThe other thing is the data is\nstored right there on my computer.\n\n94\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,740\nSo if my computer has\na hard drive crash and\n\n95\n00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,415\nI loose all my data I just\nlost all my old email, right?\n\n96\n00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:13,000\nThat's, that's a problem with software\nwe install on our own machine.\n\n97\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,310\nSo several years ago I\nswitched to web based email.\n\n98\n00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,760\nSo now all my email is hosted\nout there in the Cloud.\n\n99\n00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,430\nRight.\n\n100\n00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,000\nSo I use Google Apps.\n\n101\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,790\nSo it's all there hosted at Google.\n\n102\n00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,070\nThe cool thing here is, I can sit down\nat any computer in the entire world and\n\n103\n00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,340\nI can log in to my web based\nGoogle Apps account and check my email,\n\n104\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,860\nand it's the same experience no\nmatter what computer I'm on.\n\n105\n00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,410\nAnd I don't care what\noperating system I'm on.\n\n106\n00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,340\nI can be on Linux, Windows, Mac,\nwhatever, it's the same mailbox.\n\n107\n00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,940\nAnd if my computer crashes and\n\n108\n00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,300\nI lose the hard drive, big deal my\ndata's up there at Google, right?\n\n109\n00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,850\nSo they're the ones that are hosting that.\n\n110\n00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,840\nSo that really does create a lot of\nbenefits, a lot of good things for\n\n111\n00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,550\nyou the end user.\n\n112\n00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,565\nNow the only negative is,\n\n113\n00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:58,260\nif my internet connection goes down,\nI can't get to my email.\n\n114\n00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,890\nRight?\n\n115\n00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,630\nAnd with email maybe that's not such a big\ndeal but if you depend on the internet\n\n116\n00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,920\naccess and it fails web-based\napplications aren't so great.\n\n117\n00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,980\nAnd so that's an area where\nsome people still like to have\n\n118\n00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,610\nthe local software to run\nright on their machine.\n\n119\n00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,200\nBut it's really getting split 50/50 now.\n\n120\n00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,640\nYou're seeing a lot of vendors where\nthey're offering their software in\n\n121\n00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,030\nmore than one form.\n\n122\n00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,800\nSo as we run down this list of\nthe different types of software,\n\n123\n00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,090\njust understand that it might not be\ninstalled right there on your machine.\n\n124\n00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,700\nIt might be a web-based solution.\n\n125\n00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,860\n>> So, every platform has\na little bit of different\n\n126\n00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,470\nthings that we have to be able to cover.\n\n127\n00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,510\nSo on my screen, I've went ahead and\ncreated a little diagram so\n\n128\n00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,200\nthat we can review what we've\njust talked about very easily.\n\n129\n00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,940\nSo remember that if you are going\nto be on a mobile device.\n\n130\n00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,310\nA lot of times, your applications\nthat you'll install on that device\n\n131\n00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,510\nis gonna come from one of the stores,\nwhether it's the Windows store, or\n\n132\n00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,610\nthe app store, or the,\nthe Google Play store.\n\n133\n00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,450\nIt's gonna come from one of those stores.\n\n134\n00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,500\nMost of us, I'm not gonna say everybody,\nbut most of us are probably not gonna\n\n135\n00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,878\ndownload the APK or, or, or anything\nlike that to, to be able to do so.\n\n136\n00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,990\nUsually, those applications are not\ndesigned for high power usage.\n\n137\n00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,080\nFairly lightweight.\n\n138\n00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880\nIt gives us the real\nfunctionality that we want.\n\n139\n00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,620\nBut maybe not all the bells and\nwhistles that we might actually need.\n\n140\n00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,690\nOr I shouldn't say need.\n\n141\n00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,590\nBut, but\nwould expect to see in a regular app.\n\n142\n00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,890\nSo and as an example, I just picked Angry\nBirds just right off the top of my head.\n\n143\n00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,570\nBecause it's something that\nall of us are probably,\n\n144\n00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,085\neven if I don't play it, cuz I don't.\n\n145\n00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've seen other people play,\n\n146\n00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,318\nI mean we've seen other people almost\nthrow their phones and you know,\n\n147\n00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,010\nI, I hate this game!\n\n148\n00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,380\nAnd so, very light-weight,\nvery small, very fast.\n\n149\n00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,403\nSo those are things that are, we're going\nto see installed on iPhones, Androids,\n\n150\n00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,264\nWindows phones.\n\n151\n00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,331\nSo those apps, those types on mobile plat,\non the mobile platform,\n\n152\n00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,250\nthat's what we're\ngenerally gonna see there.\n\n153\n00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,903\nOn the desktop side.\n\n154\n00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:50,624\nRemember that these are the ones\nthat we're probably going to end up\n\n155\n00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,843\ndownloading, or we're going to buy and\n\n156\n00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:57,343\nthere's going to be some type of media\ninstallation, whether it's a CD or a DVD,\n\n157\n00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,388\nSometimes even the newer apps may be\ncome in a USB thumb drive that you might\n\n158\n00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:05,434\nactually go ahead and stick in to\nthe computer or run that optical drive and\n\n159\n00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,610\nbe able to run that app and\nbe able to do the installation.\n\n160\n00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,040\nOn certain types of this\nsoftware you may see it.\n\n161\n00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,350\nIt's actually one of those in\nwhich you go and there's a box and\n\n162\n00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,570\nit says,\nyou need to have these requirements.\n\n163\n00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,200\nIn other words, not only did the operating\nsystem need hardware requirements, but\n\n164\n00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,050\nyou're going to see that even sometimes\nthese applications are also asking for\n\n165\n00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,920\na certain amount of the hard drive, or\n\n166\n00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,780\nhow much RAM do you actually\nhave to make to make it run.\n\n167\n00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,010\nSo when I talk about server or\ndesktop, these applications\n\n168\n00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,790\nare designed to run 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week providing a service for\n\n169\n00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,650\nyou and me, or, I could actually\njust have it run on my own machine.\n\n170\n00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,810\nSo, an example of that might be an email\nserver, such as Microsoft Exchange, or\n\n171\n00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,180\nmaybe independently on my own computer,\nI may run something like Quickbooks.\n\n172\n00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,300\nSo, here we'll see that these are the ones\nwe're gonna see installed on PCs or\n\n173\n00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,510\nserver hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,400\nAnd then, lastly, the web-based,\nthat we were just mentioning,\n\n175\n00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,240\nusually we don't see a lot of this stuff\ndownloaded or installed on My Computer.\n\n176\n00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,030\nNow, there may be some,\na little bit of an exception here.\n\n177\n00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,270\nUsually they do run from a web browser,\nbut it could be that they might ask for\n\n178\n00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,980\nan add-on to be installed on your\ncomputer so it can function, you know,\n\n179\n00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,540\nthe way that they want it to.\n\n180\n00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,200\nSo we mentioned Google Apps, but remember\nthere's also competitors out there such as\n\n181\n00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,240\nOffice 365, and they really don't require\nany one particular hardware requirement.\n\n182\n00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,970\nSo you'll see these used universally,\nas long as you have the web browser.\n\n183\n00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,180\n>> Yeah, and, and that is a growing area.\n\n184\n00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,830\nYou're seeing more and\n\n185\n00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,010\nmore applications go that way, from small\nproviders all the way up to big providers.\n\n186\n00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,790\nIt is a, a, a growing market.\n\n187\n00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,790\nAll right, so Ronnie,\nlet's take a look at some actual software.\n\n188\n00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,320\nNow specifically calls out four categories\nof software in the exam objectives, and\n\n189\n00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,714\nI know you made a diagram\nthat kind of shows that.\n\n190\n00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,350\n>> Yup.\n>> We'll use that.\n\n191\n00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,490\nBut the four categories kind of work,\nwell let's just go piecemeal,\n\n192\n00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,680\nright, I don't want to do a big summary.\n\n193\n00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480\nLet's start with,\n\n194\n00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,600\nwith probably with the most important\none which is productivity software.\n\n195\n00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,390\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,990\nProductivity software is any\nsoftware that helps you do your job,\n\n197\n00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,190\nor, or to do your job better than\nyou would without a computer.\n\n198\n00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,670\nAll right, for example,\nwhen you go to a bank to withdraw money,\n\n199\n00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,570\nwell the teller could break out their\nnotepad and do your withdrawal on paper.\n\n200\n00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,620\nBut if they have the computer\nthey can pull up your balance,\n\n201\n00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,500\nthey can withdraw the money,\n\n202\n00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,240\nthey can transfer funds they can do all of\nthat right there on the computer far more\n\n203\n00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,190\nfast using their banking software,\nall right?\n\n204\n00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,320\nSo that's an example of\nproductivity software.\n\n205\n00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,250\nIt helps you do things faster and\nbetter, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,080\nSo think of productivity\nsoftware as work software.\n\n207\n00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,580\nAlright so let's take a look\nat some of the kinds of work\n\n208\n00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,260\nsoftware that's out there.\n\n209\n00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,870\nProbably the most common the one\nthat we all use is word processing.\n\n210\n00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,860\nA word processing software package\nis one that helps you write.\n\n211\n00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,320\nYou know, i, if you're writing letters,\ndocuments, forms, any kind of,\n\n212\n00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,530\nof legal stuff, articles.\n\n213\n00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,590\nIf you need to write text,\nyou use a word processor.\n\n214\n00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,870\nAnd word processors normally have a,\na couple of features,\n\n215\n00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,360\nthings like a spell-checker formatting, so\nyou can change your font and font size.\n\n216\n00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,530\nThey normally have basic\npage setting abilities,\n\n217\n00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,460\nso you can set margins so your words don't\nrun off the edge of the page, right?\n\n218\n00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,570\nThose are all things that\na word processor does.\n\n219\n00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,840\nEvery major operating system comes\nwith a word processor built in, but\n\n220\n00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,650\nthey're usually very, very simple.\n\n221\n00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,540\nRight in, in Mac OS you have text edit\nIn Windows you have Notepad and Wordpad.\n\n222\n00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,480\nIn Linux you, you have all sorts of stuff.\n\n223\n00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,220\nBut there are advanced wordprocessing\nsuites that are out there.\n\n224\n00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,590\nThings like Microsoft Word and\nOpen Office Writer.\n\n225\n00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,560\nYou know, applications like that,\nthat, that give you a lot more power.\n\n226\n00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,900\nThe ability to do crazy things like,\nMicrosoft Word, for example,\n\n227\n00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,180\nyou can print mailing labels out of it,\nyou can print all of the sticker sheets,\n\n228\n00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,890\nand actually put addresses and\nall that in there.\n\n229\n00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,020\nYou can do mail merges,\nwhere you create a generic letter and\n\n230\n00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,230\nit automatically swaps in peoples names.\n\n231\n00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,120\nYou could do some really crazy stuff\nwith an advanced word processor.\n\n232\n00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,740\nNow with all of these ta, software\npackages we're gonna talk about, there's,\n\n233\n00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,310\nthere's the packages that are commercially\navailable, that you've gotta pay for.\n\n234\n00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,030\nAnd some can be pretty expensive.\n\n235\n00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,740\nAnd then, there's almost always\nan open-source alternative.\n\n236\n00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,380\nOne that'll be free\nthat anybody could use.\n\n237\n00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,880\nSo, using Microsoft Office or, or\nMicrosoft Word specifically as\n\n238\n00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,460\nan example for the word processing side,\nyou can go and buy Microsoft Word.\n\n239\n00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,970\nIt'll cost you you know,\na couple of hundred bucks.\n\n240\n00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,580\nOr you can use Open Office,\nwhich has a word processor in it too, and\n\n241\n00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,850\nis completely free.\n\n242\n00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,850\nSo there's a, a lot of those\ndifferent packages out there.\n\n243\n00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,380\nLet me, let me just bring up some,\nsome web pages here real quick.\n\n244\n00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,500\nSo If we want to take a look\nat Microsoft Office, right?\n\n245\n00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,450\nHere, so\nI'm gonna pull up Microsoft Office.\n\n246\n00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,270\nSo this is the Microsoft Office suite and\nyou'll see they have like home and\n\n247\n00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,120\nbusiness so I'm gonna go into business.\n\n248\n00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,060\nAnd, it's made up of a number of different\nprograms, and the program that I\n\n249\n00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,120\nwas talking about was Microsoft Word,\nso that's where I'm going right here.\n\n250\n00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,160\nSo, whenever this loads.\n\n251\n00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,430\nMicrosoft site's a little slow today.\n\n252\n00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,080\nThere we go.\n\n253\n00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,020\nThere's Microsoft Word, and you'll see\nit's promoting that it's a, you know,\n\n254\n00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,810\nword processor.\n\n255\n00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,260\nYou can write articles.\n\n256\n00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,120\nYou can develop mailers,\nbanners, all sorts of stuff.\n\n257\n00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,090\nImages too.\n\n258\n00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,630\nAll within Microsoft Word.\n\n259\n00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,370\nAnd then if I go to Open Office.\n\n260\n00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,720\nOpen Office is an open source\nproduct That means it's, it's free.\n\n261\n00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120\nYou can download source code for\nit if you want.\n\n262\n00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,490\nAnd inside of it they have\nvarious applications.\n\n263\n00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,510\nAnd Writer is their word processor.\n\n264\n00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,380\nAnd if you look at their word,\nword processor,\n\n265\n00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,590\nmuch like Microsoft Word, you can write\nyour articles, you've got text formatting,\n\n266\n00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,040\nyou've got all sorts of stuff,\nvery similar.\n\n267\n00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,450\nNow the Microsoft one has\na few extra features,\n\n268\n00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,820\nbut you can see where they are very,\nvery similar.\n\n269\n00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,620\nSo, at the end of the day a word\nprocessor It helps you to type,\n\n270\n00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,110\nit helps you to write things and\ndo it more efficiently.\n\n271\n00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,650\nAlright the, the next one on our list\nis spreadsheet software, alright.\n\n272\n00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,260\nSpreadsheet software, it's gonna go right\nalongside the word processing side.\n\n273\n00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,650\nA spreadsheet software is one that gives\nyou basically a table, a bunch of cells,\n\n274\n00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,080\ncolumns and rows.\n\n275\n00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,660\nAnd can do basic mathematics for\nyou, alright.\n\n276\n00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,080\nNow that, that might sound silly.\n\n277\n00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960\nYou're like, yeah,\nI can do basic mathematics.\n\n278\n00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,090\nBut, I, I'm talking about something\na little more complex, right?\n\n279\n00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,366\nSo instead of just saying, you know,\nwhat's five plus five, well that,\n\n280\n00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,712\nthat's ten,\nI don't need a program to tell me that.\n\n281\n00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:34,218\nBut, if I've got a list of sales that have\nbeen performed in my company over the last\n\n282\n00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:39,503\nten months, and when I go and look at that\nis a huge amount of, of sales, right.\n\n283\n00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:44,333\nSo I'm going to have amount and\ndate and product, and so on, and\n\n284\n00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,715\nI start tabulating how much\nof a product was sold, and so\n\n285\n00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:54,545\nI might have $15 on one day and\n$24 on another day and so on, right?\n\n286\n00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,460\nSo we start adding this in.\n\n287\n00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,540\nNow, imagine I don't just have three\nentries but I have a thousand entries and\n\n288\n00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,670\nI need to add that up.\n\n289\n00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,620\nWell, that's kind of difficult math when\n\n290\n00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,320\nyou're adding a thousand\ndifferent entries.\n\n291\n00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320\nBut in a spreadsheet you can\nquickly take these things.\n\n292\n00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,620\nAnd it'll total it up for\nyou, and so there's my total.\n\n293\n00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,650\nIt just added that,\nat one click of a button,\n\n294\n00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,250\nit added up those various values and\ngave me that.\n\n295\n00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,080\nAnd there's complex formulas you can do\nin here too to calculate averages and\n\n296\n00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,390\nmaximums, minimums all,\nall sorts of crazy things.\n\n297\n00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,840\nVery powerful stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,530\nWhen you get data into a spread\nsheet you can manipulate it and\n\n299\n00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,910\nturn it into reports that people\ncan use to make decisions.\n\n300\n00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,030\nThese are very important.\n\n301\n00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,960\nThe one I'm using here is Microsoft Excel.\n\n302\n00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,860\nIt's a part of the Microsoft Office Suite\nwhich is very common.\n\n303\n00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,840\nBut Open Office has their own, and\nlet's see if I still have that open here.\n\n304\n00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,734\nSo this was the Open Office Writer,\nbut they have Calc,\n\n305\n00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,718\nwhich is data spreadsheet software.\n\n306\n00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:54,616\nAnd if you look at their screenshot here,\nit's not much different than the Excel\n\n307\n00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:58,740\nwindow that I just showed you, again, they\nkind of shoot for that feature parody, so\n\n308\n00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,696\nthey are very, very similar\n>> They achieve the same goal.\n\n309\n00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,980\n>> The nice thing about using these\nelectronic spreadsheets is that they're\n\n310\n00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,992\ndynamically able to calculate for\nus, so that if we change one field,\n\n311\n00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:14,960\nwe don't have go back and\nrecalculate the entire formula.\n\n312\n00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,770\nWhat they do for us is that they\nallow us to create once and then,\n\n313\n00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,775\nbe able to change that as we need it, so\nregardless of whether we have 1000 rows or\n\n314\n00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,990\nten rows, it will do it, and we don't\nhave do the whole thing every time,\n\n315\n00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,230\neach time, so that's why these are really\nproductivity types of software.\n\n316\n00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,458\n>> All right, so\nlets summarize some of the other ones,\n\n317\n00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,819\nand we don't want to bore you to death\nwith all these [NOISE] got a really big\n\n318\n00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,859\nlist here, but lets just run down\nsome of the other ones we have.\n\n319\n00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,610\nWe've got email software.\n\n320\n00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,520\nSo, when you access your email you\nmight use a web browser like I do but\n\n321\n00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,550\nyou might have specialized software\njust for managing your email, and\n\n322\n00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,630\nit's designed to help you quickly and\neasily deal with your emails.\n\n323\n00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,730\nReply, respond, your forward,\n\n324\n00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,320\nall that good stuff all right\nfrom inside of an email program.\n\n325\n00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,790\n>> We also have a basic database software.\n\n326\n00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,310\nBasic databases can help\nus out even at home.\n\n327\n00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,470\nIf I wanted to keep track of all\nthe movies that I might have, or\n\n328\n00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,425\nDon's music collection is, is massive.\n\n329\n00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:12,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he wanted to be able to,\n\n330\n00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,640\nto just bring up an interface,\nin which he said hey, I,\n\n331\n00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640\nI wanna look up all the songs by Coldplay.\n\n332\n00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,720\nI'm sure that Don has all the,\nthe albums there by Coldplay.\n\n333\n00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,610\n>> Oh that'd be easy.\nYou get zero.\n\n334\n00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,110\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, oh there you go.\n\n335\n00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,920\nSo, so these basic data programs really\ndo help us to keep track of things,\n\n336\n00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,200\nto help us find information very quickly.\n\n337\n00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,230\nUnlike a, a regular database that\nwe might find in the business.\n\n338\n00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,686\nThey're designed to run on my computer and\n\n339\n00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,041\nhave a very small database that\nI can query against those.\n\n340\n00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,652\nSo really,\nreally neat productivity software.\n\n341\n00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:45,200\n>> Our next one is PDF viewers and\ncreators.\n\n342\n00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,050\nNow a PDF That's a portable\ndocument format.\n\n343\n00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,300\nThere's a company called Adobe,\nAdobe software, and many,\n\n344\n00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,710\nmany years ago,\nprobably over twenty years,\n\n345\n00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,280\nnow, they created this document format\nthat would work on every operating system.\n\n346\n00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,820\nOne problem we had was people were\ncreating documents in different\n\n347\n00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,100\nformats and\nthey wouldn't work on some computers.\n\n348\n00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,350\nSo they created this generic\ndocument format called a PDF.\n\n349\n00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,300\nAnd every major operating system has\na tool that will let you view those.\n\n350\n00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,570\nSo, if you want to give information\nout to your customers using a PDF is\n\n351\n00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,250\na great method.\n\n352\n00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,080\nCause you know they'll be able to open\nit and see it and all the images and\n\n353\n00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,620\ntext will be laid out exactly\nthe way that you want it.\n\n354\n00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,420\nWell if you're a business person\nyou might need to create that PDF.\n\n355\n00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,960\nAnd to use a PDF creator to do it.\n\n356\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,370\nThe main one is a program called,\nAdobe Acrobat,\n\n357\n00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,110\nthat's the program they have that, that\nlet's you create and edit these documents,\n\n358\n00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,680\nand they also have the Adobe PDF viewer or\nthey call it the PDF reader.\n\n359\n00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,960\nAdd that is what let's\nyou view the PDF's but\n\n360\n00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,922\nthey're other companies like Foxit\nthat makes PDF readers and writers so\n\n361\n00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,885\nthere's other competitors in that market\ntoo but this definitely falls under\n\n362\n00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:51,615\nproductivity cause it's a great way to\ncommunicate data to your customers.\n\n363\n00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:54,080\n>> The other one that we have\nis presentation software.\n\n364\n00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,592\nIf you've ever gone into a meeting in\nwhich they're doing a slide show right up\n\n365\n00:18:57,592 --> 00:18:58,294\non the screen.\n\n366\n00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:02,598\nMore than likely they're running\npresentation software that allows them to\n\n367\n00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:06,897\ncreate individual slides and then they\ncan use a, a a wireless pointer or\n\n368\n00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:11,087\nwireless clicker that will allow\nthem to advance from one to another.\n\n369\n00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:14,596\nOne of the more popular programs that\nwe see here is gonna be something like\n\n370\n00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:18,530\nMicrosoft Office PowerPoint is\nprobably the, the most popular one.\n\n371\n00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,755\nNow on the OpenOffice side,\n\n372\n00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:22,214\ndo you know what that one's\ncalled on the presentation?\n\n373\n00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:23,020\nI don't remember.\n\n374\n00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,300\n>> Theirs is called oh\nshoot it is called Impress.\n\n375\n00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,051\n>> Impress.\n>> That's what theirs is called.\n\n376\n00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:31,792\n>> Yeah, and that's all about that,\nis making the impression, it's making\n\n377\n00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:35,884\nthe presentation so you would usually,\nalong with that presentation is usually,\n\n378\n00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,100\nsomebody is going to be of course\ndelineating what's going on and\n\n379\n00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,009\nwhy you're actually there and why you need\nto view this particular presentation.\n\n380\n00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:48,508\nThe next one that comes to you calls out\nis desktop publishing software and at a,\n\n381\n00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,980\nat a quick glance,\nit looks a lot like a word processor.\n\n382\n00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,120\nDesktop publishing, you can go and you can\nwrite articles or text or whatever and\n\n383\n00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,470\nit will lay it out exactly the way\nyou want it but the difference here\n\n384\n00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,600\nis that desktop publishing software\nis designed specifically for\n\n385\n00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,080\npeople who are going to be\ncreating paper published works.\n\n386\n00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,290\nIf you're writing a novel, if you're\nwriting articles for the newspaper,\n\n387\n00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,420\nthey have to do something called type\nsetting and page setting, and that's where\n\n388\n00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,400\nthey arrange all of the words and\nall of the letters in a way that their ink\n\n389\n00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,440\nprinters can generate them and have them\nlined up and fit perfectly on the page.\n\n390\n00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,370\nThere's a whole art and science to\nlaying out a newspaper, for example.\n\n391\n00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,020\nAnd so they use desktop publishing\nsoftware to create those.\n\n392\n00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,080\nEven small projects, things like\nchurch bulletins or, or whatever,\n\n393\n00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,150\nyou need desktop publishing\nsoftware to create those.\n\n394\n00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,890\nThe, the most popular\n\n395\n00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,405\none that's out there in use is a product\nthat's called Adobe Pagemaker.\n\n396\n00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,680\nThat's from the Adobe company again, and\n\n397\n00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,730\nwhat it does is it let's you\nlay all that information out.\n\n398\n00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,044\nAnd, the way you've laid it out is\nhow it will come out on that printer,\n\n399\n00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,104\nwithout any interpretation or deviation.\n\n400\n00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:52,432\nIt is done exactly\nthe way that you want it,\n\n401\n00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:56,129\nso a lot of book printing houses\nrequire the use of this, all right.\n\n402\n00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,298\nBut, there are other formats,\n\n403\n00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,120\nother software packages that you\ncan use to generate this stuff.\n\n404\n00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,080\nMicrosoft has one called\nMicrosoft Publisher,\n\n405\n00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320\nit kind of pales in\ncomparison to Pagemaker for\n\n406\n00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,305\nwhat it can do, but there are plenty\nof other onesthat are out there.\n\n407\n00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,442\n>> We'll also call out\npersonal information managers.\n\n408\n00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:16,069\nIf you kinda remember in the, in the 90s\nwhen everybody had these binders where\n\n409\n00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,607\nthey would keep their contacts\nas well as a calendar, notes,\n\n410\n00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:24,508\nkeeping track of receipts, keeping track\nof all these different business items that\n\n411\n00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:27,601\nwe would normally need and\nwe had that binder with us.\n\n412\n00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:30,313\nAnd, and it was always amazing to me that,\nthat it,\n\n413\n00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:32,300\nit's just like cell phones, right?\n\n414\n00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,280\nThey, they would go super small and\nthey would get incredibly large and\n\n415\n00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,140\ndo that again.\n\n416\n00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,470\nWell, today we can keep\nthem in electronic format.\n\n417\n00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,890\nAnd there are many various ones out there.\n\n418\n00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,500\nI said I, I generally just use\nthe calendar program anymore\n\n419\n00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,710\nto just keep track of things for\nme because it just handles it so well.\n\n420\n00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,200\nThat I don't worry about actually bringing\nup a personal information manager that I\n\n421\n00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,530\nmight buy at a,\nat another product instead.\n\n422\n00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,189\nBut there are so\nmany of them that are out there.\n\n423\n00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:03,695\n>> Well this is one where a lot of times\nyou, you don't see standalone PIMs\n\n424\n00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:07,688\nanymore, all right, they were called PIMs,\npersonal information managers.\n\n425\n00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:11,032\nAnd even Microsoft, where they used to\nhave a program called Schedule Plus, and\n\n426\n00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,845\nthat's exactly what that was was\na personal information manager.\n\n427\n00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,255\nThat's all it did.\n\n428\n00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,885\nEventually they rolled all of it's\nfeatures into Outlook in your\n\n429\n00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:19,065\nemail software.\n\n430\n00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:21,755\nThey figured, hey,\nemail that's you interacting,\n\n431\n00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,510\nkeeping up with your customers and so on.\n\n432\n00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,790\n>> You need your contacts.\n\n433\n00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,890\nAll your people, basically your rolodex,\nyou store it in there.\n\n434\n00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,300\nYour calendar, you store that in there.\n\n435\n00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,600\nYour notes, and to dos,\nyou store that in there.\n\n436\n00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,290\nAll of those things,\nright there in this one program.\n\n437\n00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,580\nSo, you might have a single program\nthat does more that one thing.\n\n438\n00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,360\nAnd Microsoft Outlook is\na very good example of that.\n\n439\n00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,240\nAll right.\nThe, the last one we have for\n\n440\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,610\nour productivity software is\nthe remote desktop software.\n\n441\n00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,100\nNow what the heck is this?\n\n442\n00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,110\nWell, I mentioned earlier\none of the challenges I have\n\n443\n00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,820\nin that I bounce around from\ncomputer to computer all the time.\n\n444\n00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,040\nAnd when I sit down on one computer it\ndoesn't necessarily have the software\n\n445\n00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,260\nthat I need.\n\n446\n00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,140\nSo, one of the tools I like\nto use is Remote Desktop.\n\n447\n00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,010\nI have a computer sitting at my house\nright now that's powered on that has\n\n448\n00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,840\nall of the software I need\nthrough any given day, and\n\n449\n00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,820\nI can go anywhere in the world and fire up\nmy Remote Desktop software and I can see\n\n450\n00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,040\nthe screen of my computer at home as\nif I was sitting right in front of it.\n\n451\n00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,620\nAnd so it doesn't matter that the computer\nI'm sitting at doesn't have my software,\n\n452\n00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,020\nbecause I see the screen of my computer at\nhome, and I can work as if I was there.\n\n453\n00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,620\nAnd that really is a,\n\n454\n00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,280\na handy thing to have because it\nmeans that I can work from anywhere.\n\n455\n00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,570\nAnd I used various software to do it,\n\n456\n00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,520\nbut but there's plenty of third\nparty softwares that offer it.\n\n457\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,510\nCompanies like LogMeIn, there's\nCitrix GoToMeeting, or not GoToMeeting,\n\n458\n00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,470\nGoToMyPC, there we go.\n\n459\n00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,550\nThat'll let you see your screen remotely.\n\n460\n00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,460\nAnd they usually charge a monthly fee for\nit.\n\n461\n00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,707\nIt's not very much, you just install\na little program on your computer at home,\n\n462\n00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:56,517\nor at your office or wherever and\nyou can remotely connect in and work, so\n\n463\n00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,468\nthat's for most desktop software.\n\n464\n00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,200\nAll right, so\n\n465\n00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,114\nthat's kind of a summary of the\nproductivity software that's available.\n\n466\n00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:06,172\nWe've got several other categories\nthat we want to take a look at too.\n\n467\n00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:07,140\nWell, it, it's just three.\n\n468\n00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,870\nIt, it's not that bad.\n\n469\n00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,900\nSo we'll take a look at those.\n\n470\n00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,490\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n471\n00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,780\nSo why don't we pause for a breather and\nwhen we get back we're gonna\n\n472\n00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,520\nbe hitting collaboration software, next.\n\n473\n00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,766\n[MUSIC]\n\n474\n00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,550\nAll right.\n\n475\n00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,790\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n476\n00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,280\nSo we are going to continue on with our,\nour four categories of,\n\n477\n00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,760\nof software that you are going\nto see on most computers.\n\n478\n00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,785\nAnd our next category is\nCollaboration Software.\n\n479\n00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:41,235\nAnd Collaboration Software\njust at its most simplistic\n\n480\n00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:45,025\nis software that enables you to\ncommunicate with other people.\n\n481\n00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,925\nAny kind of communication\nthat you can think of.\n\n482\n00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:51,852\nSo we might be talking about phone calls,\nvideo conferences, email, faxes.\n\n483\n00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:54,482\nJust, just think of anyway that\nyou talk to somebody other than\n\n484\n00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:56,912\nactually talking to them,\nbecause that doesn't count.\n\n485\n00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,572\nSo any of the other ones,\nanything that uses technology,\n\n486\n00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:02,312\nthat falls under collaboration software.\n\n487\n00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:04,962\nSo they specifically call it quite,\nquite a few.\n\n488\n00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,122\nI hate when they start out\nwith online work space.\n\n489\n00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,370\nThe, the very first one that CompTIA\ncalls, it was called an online work space.\n\n490\n00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,930\nAnd it's really a collection of all\nof the other ones in, in one place.\n\n491\n00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,920\nIf you are a, let's say you're a,\na sales person.\n\n492\n00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,100\nAnd you go and sell to people in person.\n\n493\n00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,640\nSo you’re going to people's offices.\n\n494\n00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,030\nAnd you are,\nyou're trying to sell something.\n\n495\n00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,400\nMaybe you're like a pharmaceutical rep or\nsomething like that.\n\n496\n00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,840\nWell, where's your office?\n\n497\n00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,940\nIt doesn't matter, wherever your\noffice is you shouldn't be there.\n\n498\n00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,320\nRight?\nYou don't make money when you're sitting\n\n499\n00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,220\nin the office, you make money\nwhen you're out there selling.\n\n500\n00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,270\nSame thing with like, real estate agents.\n\n501\n00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,020\nSo, for people like this they need\nto be able to communicate and\n\n502\n00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,230\nhave access to all of their data\nwithout being in the office.\n\n503\n00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,760\nAnd an online workspace facilitates that.\n\n504\n00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,070\nThere's a number of companies\nout there that offer this.\n\n505\n00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,127\nBasically a, a web page or a computer that\nyou can log into on the internet that has\n\n506\n00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,942\nall of your communications\nneeds covered right there.\n\n507\n00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,721\nAll right.\n\n508\n00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:02,740\nJust two quick examples here on this one.\n\n509\n00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,290\nOne of the bigger ones that's out\nthere is Amazon webs WorkSpaces.\n\n510\n00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,690\nThat's a, a service from Amazon where\nyou basically rent a desktop from them.\n\n511\n00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,060\nThey give you a, a Windows 7 desktop\nthat's running Microsoft Office, and\n\n512\n00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,650\nyou pay a monthly fee for it.\n\n513\n00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,110\nBut you can set it up with your email,\nyour other software, put everything that\n\n514\n00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,090\nyou need on it, and then you just\nremotely connect into it and work.\n\n515\n00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,290\nThat becomes your office, that's online.\n\n516\n00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:25,930\nAll right.\n\n517\n00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,270\nThe negative with this is it does\nrequire a lot of configuration.\n\n518\n00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,070\nOn the other side though,\nthere's companies like GlassCubes.\n\n519\n00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,110\nThat gives you just\na webpage that you log into.\n\n520\n00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,780\nSo there's not really any\nconfiguration necessary there.\n\n521\n00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,150\nBut inside of that webpage,\nthey have all sorts of stuff for\n\n522\n00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,640\nsharing files, doing video conferences,\nmaking phone calls, to-do lists.\n\n523\n00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,390\nAll the different things that you would\nmanage as part of your normal office\n\n524\n00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,840\nactivities, right there\nvia a web-based interface.\n\n525\n00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,060\nSo, these are called\nonline work spaces and\n\n526\n00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,650\nthey just have everything you need to\ncommunicate and, and, and usually more.\n\n527\n00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,980\nRight?\nThey normally go beyond that.\n\n528\n00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,690\n>> The other one that we have is a subset\nof that online work space that we talked\n\n529\n00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,070\nabout as being the document storage and\nsharing.\n\n530\n00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,945\nWe use it here.\n\n531\n00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:11,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We use something\n\n532\n00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,290\nthat we call Google Drive.\n\n533\n00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,180\nInstead of me saving something\njust to my hard drive,\n\n534\n00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,365\nwhat I can do instead is save it\nup to this cloud storage device.\n\n535\n00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:23,515\nAnd then, all of us have access to it and\naccess it.\n\n536\n00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:24,965\nAnd, the nice thing about it too,\n\n537\n00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,465\nis especially when you\nhave some like a document.\n\n538\n00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,370\nWe can even be editing it if we need to.\n\n539\n00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,985\n>> Mm-hm..\n>> And, the other person that's actually\n\n540\n00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,525\nopened it up can see it and\nedit it, as well.\n\n541\n00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:36,835\nSo, this type of storage is actually,\nbecoming more and more prevalent.\n\n542\n00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:37,565\nSo much so\n\n543\n00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:42,080\nthat, that Microsoft recently said, look,\nwe're gonna offer like, unlimited storage.\n\n544\n00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, so,\n\n545\n00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,520\nit used to be like 15 gigs or so.\n\n546\n00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,340\nBut today they're even talking about\nthe ability to offer everything,\n\n547\n00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,970\nunlimited overall.\n\n548\n00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,820\nAnd so I have my own OneDrive here and\nthere's nothing really in it.\n\n549\n00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,310\nAnd then there's my OneDrive\naccount from Microsoft.\n\n550\n00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,870\nIn which it gives me that access and\nnow it can synchronize with my computer.\n\n551\n00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,680\nAnything that I store in that\nOneDrive folder can now go ahead and\n\n552\n00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,250\ncopy on up to the Cloud.\n\n553\n00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,300\nAnd the nice thing,\nI don't have to be on my computer.\n\n554\n00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,190\nI can access it from anywhere.\n\n555\n00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,100\nSo it really does help\nbecause now I don't depend on\n\n556\n00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,490\nthe integrity of my own system's hard\ndrive to make sure I have all my files.\n\n557\n00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,330\nIt's now gonna be stored some place\nwhich can be stored anywhere.\n\n558\n00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,800\nYou know, which is very much a benefit.\n\n559\n00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,430\n>> And that's become a real\ncompetitive one too because,\n\n560\n00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,120\nlike originally you had Dropbox, was the,\nthe big guy in network shared storage.\n\n561\n00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,970\nAnd then you saw Microsoft OneDrive and\nGoogle Drive, that you showed there.\n\n562\n00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,840\nNow there's Amazon Drive,\nApple iCloud Drive, theres Box.\n\n563\n00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,380\nThere's, there's all sorts of\ndifferent companies in that field.\n\n564\n00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,640\nSo, that's one that's\ngoing to be here to stay.\n\n565\n00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,770\nYou're going to see a lot more\ncompanies doing that in the future.\n\n566\n00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,330\nThe next one I've got is\nscreen sharing software.\n\n567\n00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,960\nAll right.\nNow I talked about remote desktop earlier\n\n568\n00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,790\nwhere I can remotely see\nthe screen in my own computer.\n\n569\n00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,560\nScreen sharing is the opposite.\n\n570\n00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,610\nSometimes you wanna show\nyour screen to other people.\n\n571\n00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,050\nSo, if I wanna do a demonstration.\n\n572\n00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,400\nMaybe, maybe you call me on the phone and\nyou say, hey Don, I'm,\n\n573\n00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,680\nI'm, I'm thinking about signing up for\nITProTV.\n\n574\n00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,608\nBut you know, what,\nwhat exactly do you guys do?\n\n575\n00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:10,040\nAnd I'm, or, you know, and I say\nwhat's my experience like if I log in?\n\n576\n00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,830\nAnd I might say, you know what,\n\n577\n00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,760\nlet me share my screen with you and\nI'll show you.\n\n578\n00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,410\nAnd I can walk you through and\nshow you the site and all that.\n\n579\n00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,985\nYou get a lot of people doing\nproduct demonstrations this way.\n\n580\n00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:20,885\nAnd it gives you a great\npersonal communications feel.\n\n581\n00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,885\nThere's a number of\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n582\n00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:25,187\nThere's services like join.me.\n\n583\n00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:26,701\nWait I have something\nthat can fire that up.\n\n584\n00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,436\nAll right.\n\n585\n00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:31,257\nSo join.me is a company that\nspecializes in screen sharing.\n\n586\n00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:34,017\nAnd what they do is they have a very\nsimple website you go to, and you can\n\n587\n00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:37,247\nstart a meeting, and that'll create\na link you can share to other people and\n\n588\n00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:38,877\nthen they can come in and see your screen.\n\n589\n00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,987\nYou're now presenting to them.\n\n590\n00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,397\nThere's other software like\nTeamViewer that you can use.\n\n591\n00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,527\nGoToMeeting is another one,\nwhich is from Citrix.\n\n592\n00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:51,167\nGoToMeeting lets you share your\nscreen out to many people.\n\n593\n00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,967\nSo there's tons of services\nlike this that are available,\n\n594\n00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,620\nand definitely makes present,\npresentations a lot easier.\n\n595\n00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,710\n>> Another popular one today is also\nthe video conferencing software too.\n\n596\n00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,560\nIf you use Skype, if you've also\nseen what, what Don just mentioned,\n\n597\n00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,590\nthe GoToMeeting...\n\n598\n00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,800\nWe can all be connected\nusing a video webcam.\n\n599\n00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,930\nAnd that way we have the live interaction\nto be able to see the expression\n\n600\n00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,875\nwhen we say here's what we need to do and\nthen you see the frown on somebody's face.\n\n601\n00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right there you kind of\n\n602\n00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,870\nrealize that you made an impact\nmore than you wanted to.\n\n603\n00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,770\nThis is very good.\n\n604\n00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,650\nBecause most companies today with\nthe economy the way that it is,\n\n605\n00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,180\nthey're experiencing this little crunch,\nof instead of being able to fly everybody\n\n606\n00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,955\nout to a nice meeting in Chicago, where\nthey might be able to do the same meeting.\n\n607\n00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:41,580\nBe as productive, sitting there in their\noffice without the expense account.\n\n608\n00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,410\nBut still being able to do all the things\nthat they need to in this meeting\n\n609\n00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,260\nand online.\n\n610\n00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,870\nSo, you're seeing a lot of small companies\nactually use this instead of doing those\n\n611\n00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,170\nof people just flying\neverywhere to go to meetings.\n\n612\n00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:51,930\n>> Yeah.\nAnd there\n\n613\n00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,200\nare several options you've got\nMicrosoft Skype, you mentioned.\n\n614\n00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,470\nApple FaceTime,\nthere's Google Hangouts and\n\n615\n00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,750\nthere's a, there's a ton of other\nsmaller vendors that are out there.\n\n616\n00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,800\nThey make easy video conferencing.\n\n617\n00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,690\nJust to be able to quickly see and\ntalk to people.\n\n618\n00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,920\nSo the next one we got the instant\nmessaging software, IM.\n\n619\n00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,850\nAnd instant messaging is kind of\nwithered over the last few years but\n\n620\n00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,890\nthere was a period time\nwhere it was really popular.\n\n621\n00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,940\nYoud run a little chat client on your\ncomputer, and you can quickly and\n\n622\n00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,120\neasily chat with other people.\n\n623\n00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,902\nYou type a message, and it will pop\nup on the other person's screen.\n\n624\n00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:27,490\nYou have things like AOL,\ninstant messenger, ICQ, the.\n\n625\n00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,970\n>> Google hangouts today is a big one.\n\n626\n00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,900\n>> Oh, Google Hangouts still does it.\n\n627\n00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,880\nWhat was Microsoft's called,\nthey had one, the MSN messenger.\n\n628\n00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,325\n>> Messenger, messenger.\n\n629\n00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:38,634\n>> And notice I said had, we've seen\na lot of these chat clients go away.\n\n630\n00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,663\nAnd that's because people have\ntext messaging and Facebook and\n\n631\n00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,345\nother ways to be able to chat.\n\n632\n00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:44,945\nBut even Facebook has a little embedded.\n\n633\n00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,255\n>> Yes, they do.\n>> Chat that you can use.\n\n634\n00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:47,677\nAnd that is instant messaging.\n\n635\n00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,560\nAnd then the last one we've\ngot is email software.\n\n636\n00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,620\nSo email software,\nthat's where we, we email people.\n\n637\n00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,250\nRight?\nIf you're going to write a letter to\n\n638\n00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,866\nsomebody and send it electronically,\nyou use email software.\n\n639\n00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:02,860\nMost people have used a web based\nsolutions by this point, but\n\n640\n00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,866\nyou might still have a client like.\n\n641\n00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,428\nMozilla Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook.\n\n642\n00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,680\nI, I actually do use a client on mine.\n\n643\n00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,250\nI use one called, Mailbox,\nwhich is terrible name,\n\n644\n00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,980\nbecause you can't just Google for it.\n\n645\n00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,060\nBut, it's by the Dropbox guys.\n\n646\n00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,060\nThere's few other applications that are\nout there that you may or may not use for\n\n647\n00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,660\nemail management, but it's just what you\nuse to interact with your email software.\n\n648\n00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,560\n>> Yeah a lot of times on the email client\nyou may see this one already installed\n\n649\n00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,980\nwith your operating system where they\nhave a very lightweight email client.\n\n650\n00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,415\nSo if you've heard of Outlook Express or,\nor Windows mail is,\n\n651\n00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:36,955\nis kind of the, the two but\n\n652\n00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,705\neven those have kind of disappeared\nfrom the Windows operating system today.\n\n653\n00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:43,405\n>> There's other devices though\nlike Apple with MacOS the,\n\n654\n00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,545\nthe mail app that they\ncontinue to improve.\n\n655\n00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:46,960\nSo it gets better all the time.\n\n656\n00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,450\nNot everybody's ditched it just yet,\nbut most of the big guys have.\n\n657\n00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,870\nIt's kind of a, kind of going away.\n\n658\n00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,730\nAll right.\nSo that's pretty much it for\n\n659\n00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,930\ncollaboration software.\n\n660\n00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,950\nJust remember it's any software\nthat facilitates you communicating\n\n661\n00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,730\nwith other people.\n\n662\n00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,330\nOur next category is utility software.\n\n663\n00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,960\nHopefully your computer runs great and\ndoes everything you want it to.\n\n664\n00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,100\nBut sometimes,\nyour computer doesn't run so great and\n\n665\n00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,710\nyou need utilities to help\nwork with it and fix it.\n\n666\n00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,440\nOr, sometimes you just want to do\nsomething that your computer doesn't\n\n667\n00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,270\nhave the function for performing.\n\n668\n00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,800\nAnd so, you've got to go and\n\n669\n00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,210\nfind additional software to extend\nthe functionality of your desktop.\n\n670\n00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,410\nAll right, that's utility software.\n\n671\n00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,920\nAnything that facilitates your computer\ndoing extra stuff, or repairing problems\n\n672\n00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,460\nwith your existing stuff,\nthat falls under this utility category.\n\n673\n00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,280\nAlright, the first example of utali,\nutility software, if I can say it...\n\n674\n00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,660\nIs anti-malware software.\n\n675\n00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,460\nNow, what the heck is that?\n\n676\n00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,710\nWell for all the good software that\nwe're talking about here in this show,\n\n677\n00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,890\nthere's plenty of bad software out there.\n\n678\n00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,850\nViruses, trojans, worms,\nthings that can get installed in\n\n679\n00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,670\nyour computer while you're browsing\nthe internet or sharing media.\n\n680\n00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,720\nAnd your computer can start\ndoing things you don't want,\n\n681\n00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,600\nlike popping up\nadvertisements all the time,\n\n682\n00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,830\nrunning really slow, relaying your\npersonal information out to the internet.\n\n683\n00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,130\nThose are some of the things that\nthat malicious software can do.\n\n684\n00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,920\nSo anti-malware software is software\nthat protects us from that.\n\n685\n00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,140\nIt helps to stop those\nthings from happening.\n\n686\n00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,810\n>> We also have software firewalls.\n\n687\n00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,660\nMost operating systems today\nalso come with a basic,\n\n688\n00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,340\nsoftware firewall that allows us to,\nto do what we call intrusion detection.\n\n689\n00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,910\nIf somebody tries to get on to our\nmachine that we don't want It,\n\n690\n00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,500\nit kinda lets us know, and\nit kinda blocks them as well, so\n\n691\n00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,860\nthat way know what's actually\ngetting on to our machines.\n\n692\n00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,570\nAnd some of them even do a two-way\nfirewall that allows us to actually see\n\n693\n00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,760\nwhat's coming off of our machine as well,\nand\n\n694\n00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,260\nblock the things we don't\nwant coming off of them.\n\n695\n00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,600\nSo if you've heard of Windows Firewall,\nthat's kind of a big one.\n\n696\n00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,240\nAnd, and then, Linux is iptables?\n\n697\n00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,800\n>> I'm some.\n\n698\n00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,480\nSome distributors use different things,\nbut iptables is probably the most common.\n\n699\n00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,360\nYep.\nYeah, a lot of your operating systems have\n\n700\n00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,430\na firewall built into them, right?\n\n701\n00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,620\nWindows, it's Windows Firewall.\n\n702\n00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,720\nMac, it's the Gatekeeper, you have\ndifferent ones for different systems.\n\n703\n00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,120\nAnd they just block that type of access.\n\n704\n00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,970\nNow another thing is you might have\nyour software firewall packaged with\n\n705\n00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,570\nyour anti-malware.\n\n706\n00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,410\nSo depending on the anti-malware software\nyou use it might have one in there.\n\n707\n00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,860\nSo if you have Symantec they have\na product called Norton 360,\n\n708\n00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,620\nwhich includes anti-malware and\na personal firewall.\n\n709\n00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,450\nOr the McAfee internet suite that has both\nantivirus, anti-malware, software viral.\n\n710\n00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,450\nAll kind of, rolled into one.\n\n711\n00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,380\nAnd, that gives you that total,\nfull solution.\n\n712\n00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,050\nSo, depending on your needs.\n\n713\n00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,051\nDepending on the software,\nyour [INAUDIBLE] those might be combined.\n\n714\n00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,440\nAll right,\nthe last one that we have is the, or wait,\n\n715\n00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,410\nit's not the last one, is it?\n\n716\n00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,700\nIt's.\n>> Diagnostic and maintenance.\n\n717\n00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,530\n>> Let's do a couple.\n\n718\n00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,970\nDiagnostic and maintenance software.\n\n719\n00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,040\nIf your computer is not performing\nthe way that you expect it to,\n\n720\n00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,970\nyou've gotta trouble shoot it, you've\ngotta find out why it's running slow,\n\n721\n00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,350\nwhy somethings not working, and\nthere are just vast amounts of,\n\n722\n00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,710\nof utility software out\nthere to help with that.\n\n723\n00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,310\nI, I can't count the amount\nof programs that I've seen.\n\n724\n00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,720\nYou know, the one that always pops up in\nmy mind is the old Norton Utilities which\n\n725\n00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,060\nis owned by Symantec.\n\n726\n00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,660\nAnd it's the sweetest software that does,\nlike, hard drive checking.\n\n727\n00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,400\nIf your hard drive is failing,\n\n728\n00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,120\nsometimes you can salvage the data\noff of it before the drive goes bad.\n\n729\n00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,620\nAnd that's what the old\nNorton Disc Doctor would do.\n\n730\n00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,460\nOr there's, Spin Right is another\napplication that's out there that'll\n\n731\n00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,790\nscan your hard drive looking for\nerrors and recovering data.\n\n732\n00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,470\nSo, that's not something built\ninto your operating system.\n\n733\n00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,360\nYour operating system might have\nsome basic trouble shooting, or\n\n734\n00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,800\nrecovery utilities.\n\n735\n00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,780\nBut, something that actually dives in and\nfixes that problem,\n\n736\n00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,440\nyou'll usually have find elsewhere\n>> Last\n\n737\n00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,020\none that I mentioned is you used\nutility software is the compression\n\n738\n00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,350\nsoftware\n>> And\n\n739\n00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,370\nthis type of software was really designed\nin the day when hard drive space was\n\n740\n00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:42,940\nat a premium.\n\n741\n00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,080\nIn other words, we,\nwe kept running out of hard drive space.\n\n742\n00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,790\nAnd they realized that hard drives weren't\nreally getting bigger or fast enough,\n\n743\n00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,450\nI guess, getting bigger fast enough\n>> That what they would do is they would\n\n744\n00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,590\nbe able to take the files and\ncompress their size and\n\n745\n00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,130\nthat way free up some\nmore hard drive space.\n\n746\n00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,800\nIn today's world of which we have like 500\ngig hard drives or terabyte hard drives,\n\n747\n00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,900\nit's hard to see the, I don't really see\nthe need of actually compressing it.\n\n748\n00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,150\nUnless I really am starting to\nrun out of space very quickly so\n\n749\n00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,790\nyou do see, still the compression\nsoftware out there but,\n\n750\n00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,040\nin today's world I don't\nsee a lot of use for it.\n\n751\n00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,830\n>> Well the main reason that\npeople still use it today and\n\n752\n00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,240\nthe reason it's not going\nanywhere is because of email.\n\n753\n00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,480\n>> Yeah\n>> And I, I know that,\n\n754\n00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,750\nthat that doesn't necessarily make\nsense right on, on face value.\n\n755\n00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,280\nBut what happens is If I\nreach out to somebody and\n\n756\n00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,030\nI say hey, can you send me those\npictures we took on vacation, or\n\n757\n00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,610\ncan you send me those\nfiles we were working on?\n\n758\n00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,060\nWhat are they gonna do?\n\n759\n00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,331\nNine times out of ten\nthey'll send it by e-mail,\n\n760\n00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:39,160\nnow e-mail is not designed\nas a file system, right?\n\n761\n00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,170\nThat's not what it's supposed to do.\n\n762\n00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,330\nIt's terrible at it.\n\n763\n00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,250\nBut people still use it, and\ne-mail has size limitation.\n\n764\n00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,730\nSo, we can use compression\nutilities to take that data, and\n\n765\n00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,650\nshrink it down so\nit'll actually fit in an email.\n\n766\n00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,460\nBut the other advantage is,\nif I want to send you a hundred files, and\n\n767\n00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,760\nyou attach them all to an email,\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n768\n00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,830\nDownload them one by one, a hundred times.\n\n769\n00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:05,370\nBut if I put them into some compression\nsoftware, it can merge them all together.\n\n770\n00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,960\n>> And now you just download that one\nfile, and then you extract it and\n\n771\n00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,620\nthere's all your files again.\n\n772\n00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,490\nAnd it's that functionality that doesn't\nnecessarily care about compression\n\n773\n00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,600\nas much as it does gathering\nutilities together.\n\n774\n00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,160\nSo, they call that archiving.\n\n775\n00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,270\nAnd so you'll hear those\nterms used interchangeably,\n\n776\n00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,400\ncompression software and\narchiving software.\n\n777\n00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,780\nWith compression software\nwe're making it smaller.\n\n778\n00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,480\nWith archiving software we're\ncombining more than one file together.\n\n779\n00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,340\nAnd then on the other side,\nwe can extract them to,\n\n780\n00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,700\nto blow it back out into the various,\nmultiple, larger files.\n\n781\n00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,400\nSo WinZip is probably one of the most\ncommon in the Windows world,\n\n782\n00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320\nthere's there's a ton of other ones,\nthough.\n\n783\n00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,430\nI like 7Zip in the Windows world,\nand, in like,\n\n784\n00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,160\nMac OS, you have Aladdin, which is another\ngreat one for expanding, or actually,\n\n785\n00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,210\nAladdin is the company, StuffIt I think\nis the software, stuff it expander.\n\n786\n00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,090\nSo there's a couple of different\npackages there, in the Linux world,\n\n787\n00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,100\nyou have almost all of\nit built into the OS.\n\n788\n00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,240\nIt's, it's really got good support for\nthat.\n\n789\n00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,140\nSo, that software kind of\ntakes two different roles.\n\n790\n00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,650\nOne for compressing, one for extracting,\nand you kind of pick which one you want.\n\n791\n00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,870\nIn the, the next section of this show\nwe'll get into some of the different types\n\n792\n00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,520\nthat, that fall into that category.\n\n793\n00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,680\nBut it is still somewhat useful,\nmostly because of email.\n\n794\n00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,405\nAll right,\nthat brings us to our last last category.\n\n795\n00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:23,735\nAnd our last one is one\nof the most complex.\n\n796\n00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:25,915\nSpecialized software.\n\n797\n00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:28,765\nNow, what are we talking about\nwhen we say specialized software?\n\n798\n00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:32,440\nThere are many people in\noccupations out there that require\n\n799\n00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,500\nvery specific software that\njust does a very specific job.\n\n800\n00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,860\nThis is not something that your\naverage home user would need or\n\n801\n00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,130\neven your average user period.\n\n802\n00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,950\nWe're talking about a very,\nvery niche market,\n\n803\n00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,990\na very small percentage of the users.\n\n804\n00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,460\nAnd so this software is usually\nincredibly expensive, first off.\n\n805\n00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,144\nBecause it's specially designed, but\nsecondly it's usually very complex.\n\n806\n00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:55,124\nIf you work in that job field,\nit makes sense to you,\n\n807\n00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:56,432\nyou understand the terminology.\n\n808\n00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:57,876\nIt's really easy to use.\n\n809\n00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,884\nBut, if you don't work in that job field.\n\n810\n00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:01,854\nIt's not an area you have expertise in,\nand\n\n811\n00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:03,782\nthe software is not gonna make much sense.\n\n812\n00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:06,990\nSo this is software designed\nspecifically for your job.\n\n813\n00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,620\nAnd a lot of people refer to this as LOB,\nor Line Of Business applications.\n\n814\n00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,120\nSo, something you need to\nto do your business, but\n\n815\n00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,710\nthat's not, not always the case.\n\n816\n00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,800\nSometimes it's kind of\nfacilitating what you do.\n\n817\n00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,080\nSo some of the different types of\nspecialized software, we have CAD,\n\n818\n00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,510\nwhich is computer assisted diagramming and\n\n819\n00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,620\nwith shoot, brain-\n>> Computer aided design?\n\n820\n00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,700\n>> Computer aided design,\nsorry, there we go.\n\n821\n00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,700\nComputer aided design.\n\n822\n00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,460\nSo, it's a graphics software, basically,\nbut it does three dimensional design work.\n\n823\n00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,564\nSo, if you're an architect, and\nyou're designing a house or a skyscraper,\n\n824\n00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:47,470\nyou can mock up the entire building\nright there inside of the CAD software.\n\n825\n00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,250\nIf you're designing a new car for\nFord, then you can fire it up and\n\n826\n00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,220\nyou can do the wire-frame and\ndesign the, the, the model for\n\n827\n00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,190\nthat vehicle doing it entirely\nelectronically inside of your system.\n\n828\n00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,470\nCAD software is very popular for\npeople that are you know,\n\n829\n00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,860\nworking in construction,\nany kind of engineering field.\n\n830\n00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,040\nBut outside of that,\nwe don't normally need to do.\n\n831\n00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,000\nSo if you've never seen it,\n\n832\n00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,810\none of the most popular ones\nis a program called AutoCAD.\n\n833\n00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,780\nAnd it's by a company called Autodesk and\nlet me just fire it up here and see if I\n\n834\n00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,393\ncan get a, a quick screenshot or something\nthat shows, well I don't want a video.\n\n835\n00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:26,820\nLet me, let me change this\nto like a image search and\n\n836\n00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,230\nI'll show you a quick view of AutoCAD.\n\n837\n00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,630\nWhen you look at it, it's rendering,\nyeah, here we go, these are, are great.\n\n838\n00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,630\nSo here you'll see where\npeople are designing a house,\n\n839\n00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,230\nthey're designing a, that's HVAC right\nthere, that's an air conditioning system.\n\n840\n00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,550\nSo they can design that out, all the\nmeasurements, all the specifications and\n\n841\n00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,160\nmake sure it works before they\nactually produce a tangible model.\n\n842\n00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,140\nThat's what AutoCAD does.\n\n843\n00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,950\nThe next one that we\nhave is graphic design.\n\n844\n00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,680\n>> You've heard of Adobe, Creative Suites.\n\n845\n00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,770\nAny time that you're trying\nto design a graphic or\n\n846\n00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,570\ntrying to design things like, or set even.\n\n847\n00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,780\nAnd, and we're trying to design logos, and\n\n848\n00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,450\nyou're probably gonna see these graphic\ndesign programs, t-shirts, you name it,\n\n849\n00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:08,020\nthese are all good programs that allow us\nto be able to see it in a computer design\n\n850\n00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,010\nbefore we go ahead and print it out and\nthen go I don't really like it.\n\n851\n00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,920\nAnd actually have through all the expense.\n\n852\n00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,520\nThe, this different type of software,\nreally good,\n\n853\n00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,730\nusually very expensive, requires\nhigh-ended machinery a lot of times, too,\n\n854\n00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,380\nto make it run efficiently\nthe way that it wants to run.\n\n855\n00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,800\n>> Yeah, and, and they can range from\nincredibly expensive to, to free.\n\n856\n00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,720\nThe Adobe Suite, you mentioned, they,\nthey really are the market leader and\n\n857\n00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,060\ntheir software's pretty expensive.\n\n858\n00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,910\nBut there's some web-based ones, there's\nsome open-source ones, too for doing that.\n\n859\n00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,710\nYou know, here, we're IT guys, we're\ntech guys, we don't do graphics design.\n\n860\n00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,130\nWe actually have a graphics designer\non staff, so that they deal with that.\n\n861\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,280\nAnd that's what, you know,\nthey work in that all day long.\n\n862\n00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,410\nThat's exactly what is useful to them.\n\n863\n00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,640\nSo, very, very specific.\n\n864\n00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,830\nAll right,\nour next one is medical software.\n\n865\n00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,560\nIf you work in a hospital or for a\ndoctor's office you have a patient records\n\n866\n00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,560\nmanagement and you need to be able\nto keep track of people's file.\n\n867\n00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,100\nWhat prescriptions they've been given,\nwhat medications they're on,\n\n868\n00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,810\ntheir medical history.\n\n869\n00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,680\nThat's something that most of\nus don't normally need to track.\n\n870\n00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,723\nOn top of that, your government more than\nlikely has placed restrictions on that.\n\n871\n00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:15,025\nYou got to protect medical records, so\nthey probably have to encrypt the data and\n\n872\n00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:15,875\nsecure it.\n\n873\n00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:19,045\nSo there's very specialized\nmedical software that does this.\n\n874\n00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,055\nThis is not something you\ncan buy in a store, in fact,\n\n875\n00:43:21,055 --> 00:43:23,927\nit's not even something you\ncan buy as a regular person.\n\n876\n00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:29,307\nFor example, the, the giant in this\nfield is a company called Epic.\n\n877\n00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,867\nEpic makes software for\nmanaging entire hospitals.\n\n878\n00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:35,927\nSo we're talking about tens of thousands\nof employees working inside of a hospital,\n\n879\n00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:39,017\nand or a hospital system, cause there's\nnormally more than one hospital strung\n\n880\n00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:42,680\ntogether, and tracking all these\npatient records and exchanging it.\n\n881\n00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,520\nWhen you go to a website like theirs,\nyou can come and\n\n882\n00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,810\nyou can see their software, and they\ndon't, they don't even talk about price.\n\n883\n00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:53,610\nThere's no buy button on here because\nevery time this is deployed in a hospital\n\n884\n00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,300\nit's gotta be customized\nto that hospital's needs.\n\n885\n00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,970\nIt's not necessarily the exact\nsame software for everybody.\n\n886\n00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,300\nThis is extremely expensive, but it can\nrevolutionize the way a hospital runs.\n\n887\n00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,260\nSo this medical software becomes very,\nvery important to them.\n\n888\n00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,395\nIt becomes a pivotal piece of just\nthe regular business operations.\n\n889\n00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,180\n>> The next one I mention is scientific.\n\n890\n00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,770\nNow, Don, you're going to have to help\nme out with this one because I can't\n\n891\n00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,270\neven think of a particular idea here.\n\n892\n00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,295\n>> Yeah, you know, so scientific stuff I,\nI shouldn't say stuff.\n\n893\n00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It does depend on the type of science\n\n894\n00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,290\nthat you're in, but there are some\nproducts that are used by a lot.\n\n895\n00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,970\nIf you're a scientist,\nwhat do you do, right?\n\n896\n00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,820\nYou run through experiments, you track\nyour results, and you document it.\n\n897\n00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,860\nScientific method says you've gotta do\nthings multiple times to ensure that\n\n898\n00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,650\nyou've got control groups, and\nyou're getting guaranteed results, and\n\n899\n00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,560\nyou need software to track that.\n\n900\n00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,260\nRight?\n\n901\n00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,870\nBut you also need software to do other\nthings, like, sequencing the human genome,\n\n902\n00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,870\nyou know, heavy mathematical operations,\nthat Large Hadron Collider,\n\n903\n00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,500\nthe LHC that's in Europe?\n\n904\n00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,080\nThat thing, you know,\n\n905\n00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,840\nthey are doing physics experiments\nthat are beyond imagination.\n\n906\n00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,790\nIt's tons of software\nmanaging that equipment.\n\n907\n00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,718\nVery specialized software written just for\nthat purpose.\n\n908\n00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:09,100\nMy, my brother-in-law actually runs\na nuclear magnetic resonance lab and\n\n909\n00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,780\nhe has software, runs on Linux,\nthat specifically\n\n910\n00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,230\nmanages their magnets to be able to do\ntheir centrifuge tests and all of that.\n\n911\n00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,720\nSo, there's all sorts of\ncustom software there.\n\n912\n00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,190\nOne of the more popular ones\nis a program called Matlab.\n\n913\n00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,838\nLet me bring Matlab up.\n\n914\n00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,600\nAnd what Matlab does,\nis it allows you to feed data into it and\n\n915\n00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,120\nthen it runs statistical analyses\non it and it detects patterns and\n\n916\n00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,260\nlets you know your correlation coefficient\nand all that other good stuff.\n\n917\n00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,550\nI know this because I took statistics in\ncollege, but [LAUGH] so, this is the type\n\n918\n00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,450\nof software that a scientist, somebody who\nis dealing with this information needs.\n\n919\n00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,240\nAnd it's not just the physical sciences,\nit's also the social sciences,\n\n920\n00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,980\nIf you're involved in Politics, for\nexample maybe you're a campaign worker.\n\n921\n00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,420\nYou need to be able to track the various\npoll results to predict the outcomes,\n\n922\n00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,960\nand software like Matlab does it,\nvery powerful stuff.\n\n923\n00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,740\n>> And I found a couple of\ndifferent examples too.\n\n924\n00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,370\nWe want to talk about price of software.\n\n925\n00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n926\n00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,449\n>> Here's one for expanding\nthe limits of Gaussian mathematics,\n\n927\n00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:11,340\nGaussian Limitation, where did that go.\n\n928\n00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,360\nComputational chemistry.\n\n929\n00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,850\nAnd you can see the price here.\n\n930\n00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,013\n>> It's only $2,500.\n\n931\n00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:17,144\n>> Only $2,500.\n>> Well at that price you buy two so\n\n932\n00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,744\nyou can have one on your laptop and\nyour desktop [CROSSTALK].\n\n933\n00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:21,863\n>> And you can see over on the left\nhand side where they actually do show\n\n934\n00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:25,000\nthe breakdown of multiple\ndifferent scientific fields.\n\n935\n00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,700\nSo there's very specialized and,\n\n936\n00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,520\nI can't believe that anyone's actually\nexpanding computational chemistry myself,\n\n937\n00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,376\nI'm sure that, that it's a great field-\n>> Really?\n\n938\n00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:37,280\n>> But, here is software\ndesigned to help that person out.\n\n939\n00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,520\n>> And if you work in that field-\n>> Yeah.\n\n940\n00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520\n>> You probably look at the software\nyou go, oh my goodness,\n\n941\n00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,400\nthat's awesome, I need that!\n\n942\n00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,940\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> Versus someone like us when\n\n943\n00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,115\nwe look at it we go,\nwell I don't know what Gaussian is.\n\n944\n00:46:45,115 --> 00:46:47,434\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, that's kind of how,\n\n945\n00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:50,040\nhow a lot of this stuff falls.\n\n946\n00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,520\nOur next one is financial.\n\n947\n00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280\nFinancial management of\nsoftware is very prevalent.\n\n948\n00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,230\nNow this is large scale and small scale.\n\n949\n00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,070\nIf you work for a bank, you more than\nlikely have financial management software\n\n950\n00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,370\nthat the tellers are using to file,\nyou know, process their transactions.\n\n951\n00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:07,150\nYour mortgage brokers are using to do your\nmortgage calculations, to issue those.\n\n952\n00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,870\nSo that's software on the,\nthe corporate side.\n\n953\n00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,300\nOn the personal side, you might have\nsomething like Quicken just to manage your\n\n954\n00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,760\npersonal finances or QuickBooks to\nmanage your small business finances.\n\n955\n00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,200\nSo that software is available,\nit's financial software, so\n\n956\n00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,930\nit's dealing with things like taxes,\ncalculating out interest rates,\n\n957\n00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,150\nyour investments, and\nmanaging you bank account.\n\n958\n00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,110\nAll stuff that kind of centers\naround that basic operation.\n\n959\n00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,960\nThis software is one that you\ndon't see online very much.\n\n960\n00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,530\nIt, there are web based offerings for\nit but people are sensitive about their\n\n961\n00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,720\nfinancial data and people prefer to have\nthat running right here on their machine.\n\n962\n00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,740\nSo that one is probably not going to\ngo fully web based any time soon but\n\n963\n00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,600\ncompanies do offer that.\n\n964\n00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,210\n>> Next little category they call out,\nwhich is highly specialized software,\n\n965\n00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,225\nis gaming.\n\n966\n00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:54,748\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And and, and the, the game that I play.\n\n967\n00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:55,373\n>> Yeah.\n\n968\n00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,109\n>> Freecell.\n\n969\n00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:57,049\n>> Freecell.\n[LAUGH]\n\n970\n00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:57,829\n>> So I'm, I'm not\n\n971\n00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:01,268\nthe biggest gamer in the world But there's\nplenty of games that are out there.\n\n972\n00:48:01,268 --> 00:48:03,508\nAnd everybody likes\ndifferent versions of the,\n\n973\n00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:06,815\nthe first person shooter all the way to,\nto things like Free Cell.\n\n974\n00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:07,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n975\n00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,990\n>> And, you know, a lot of us make fun of,\nof gaming being on the exam objectives,\n\n976\n00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,100\nbut one of the reasons they call it\nout here is we'll see this later.\n\n977\n00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,140\nIf you, if that's something that you do,\nthat you, you participate in,\n\n978\n00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,610\nyou'll probably need specialized hardware\nto be able to make that run quickly.\n\n979\n00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,798\nA lot of this stuff does,\nlike auto cad, the cad software,\n\n980\n00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:29,400\nyou really need to have a high end video\ncard to be able to handle that, and\n\n981\n00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,110\na lot of these new games\nrequire the same thing.\n\n982\n00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,430\nThe gaming industry is actually\nwhat funds a lot of the advanced\n\n983\n00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,620\nhardware development inside of computing.\n\n984\n00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,489\nIt's it's kinda a funny thing,\nbut that's how it works.\n\n985\n00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,460\nAll right, what's.\n\n986\n00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,240\nOh, last.\n\n987\n00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,210\nLast but not least.\n\n988\n00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:43,860\n>> Entertainment.\n\n989\n00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,850\n>> Entertainment, right.\n\n990\n00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,140\nYou may have a need.\n\n991\n00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,715\n>> Huh.\n>> To watch shows like\n\n992\n00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:49,610\nITProTV on the internet.\n\n993\n00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,240\n>> That's right.\n\n994\n00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,360\n>> Or just in general.\n\n995\n00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,020\nAnd so we have entertainment\nsoftware that facilitates that.\n\n996\n00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,560\nNow, we're normally talking\nabout video streaming or, or\n\n997\n00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,070\neven things that are local.\n\n998\n00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:03,820\nMaybe you have a, a slideshow, you want\nto show vacation photos to people, so\n\n999\n00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,670\nyou need software to\nbe able to power that.\n\n1000\n00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,193\nThere are a number of different\nprograms that are out there.\n\n1001\n00:49:08,193 --> 00:49:11,970\nSo, like in the Apple world,\nyou have iPhoto that can do a lot of it.\n\n1002\n00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:16,880\nIn the Windows world, you have their\nmedia library or whatever it's called.\n\n1003\n00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,540\nI can't remember because I never use it.\n\n1004\n00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,060\nSo you know, there's,\nthere's various tools like that.\n\n1005\n00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,430\nThat you can make use of.\n\n1006\n00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,960\nOn the, the video side,\nyou might have VLC Player,\n\n1007\n00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,840\nor Windows Media Player, QuickTime.\n\n1008\n00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,810\nThese are all programs that\nlet you watch videos and\n\n1009\n00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,420\nplay music, and\nthat's a pretty common thing.\n\n1010\n00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,380\nBut you're seeing a lot\nof that go web based.\n\n1011\n00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,430\nWith services like Spotify and\n\n1012\n00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,680\nNetflix, where you don't actually\nhave to have the media anymore.\n\n1013\n00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,060\nYou play it via their webpage.\n\n1014\n00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,350\nAnd so the video player or\n\n1015\n00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,460\nthe music player's embedded\nin the webpage, all right.\n\n1016\n00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,250\nSo that's kind of the entertainment\ncategory right there.\n\n1017\n00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,100\nThe point of all of this is that\nthere is a lot of software out there.\n\n1018\n00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,100\nAnd on the exam, they just want you to\nbe familiar with the typical use case\n\n1019\n00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,070\nscenario of each of those software\npackages, which is what we just went over.\n\n1020\n00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,730\nI doubt any of that was too shocking and\nnew.\n\n1021\n00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,290\nMaybe some of it like\nthe scientific software or\n\n1022\n00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,975\nwhatever that the average\nperson wouldn't know.\n\n1023\n00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:14,687\nBut when we stared talking about a word\nprocessor, if you were able to get to our\n\n1024\n00:50:14,687 --> 00:50:18,470\nweb page and log in and sign up, you've\nprobably used a word processor before.\n\n1025\n00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,910\nAnd that's how most of this stuff is.\n\n1026\n00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,490\nIt's pretty common sense.\n\n1027\n00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,430\nWhere it gets hard is the next section.\n\n1028\n00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,560\nIn the next section we're gonna\ntalk about various document types.\n\n1029\n00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,500\nAnd on the exam you need to be\nable to match the document type\n\n1030\n00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,920\nto the type of software\nthat would generate it.\n\n1031\n00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,730\nAll the things that we just talked about.\n\n1032\n00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,690\nSo, while some of that might have seemed,\nsomewhat comical, and you say \" whatever,\n\n1033\n00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,120\nI know that,\" you really\ndo need to know it.\n\n1034\n00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,110\nDon't just gloss over it and, and think\nthat that's gonna to be good enough for\n\n1035\n00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,950\nthe exam, all right?\n\n1036\n00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,000\nWe've gotta, gotta make sure we,\nwe understand all of that.\n\n1037\n00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,250\nAll right.\nWell, Ronnie,\n\n1038\n00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,040\nthat is probably a good spot for\nus to stop on this one.\n\n1039\n00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,490\nThe, the file extension one, I mean we've\ngot just a, a whole list of those things.\n\n1040\n00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,180\nOh yeah, here.\n\n1041\n00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,390\nSo, a whole list of those\nthings to go through, and\n\n1042\n00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,820\nthat's probably a whole episode in and\nof itself.\n\n1043\n00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,390\nSo, let's stop here and\nkind of wrap this one up.\n\n1044\n00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,580\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1045\n00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,090\n>> I want to remind you guys if you\nhave any questions live during the show,\n\n1046\n00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,340\nyou can go to

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,857\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening, and\n\n6\n00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,043\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:42,360\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,970\nHow's it going, Ron?\n\n9\n00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,242\n>> It is going well today, we,\nwe're in for another exciting episode.\n\n10\n00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:51,077\nThis time taking a look at file types\nwe've already taken a look at some of\n\n11\n00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,385\nthe different software.\n\n12\n00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,424\nSo we're ready to get started\non some different file types and\n\n13\n00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:57,035\nthere's a ton of them on there.\n\n14\n00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,560\n>> Yeah, and in our, in our last episode,\n\n15\n00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,270\nwe started objective 1.2,\nwhich was common programs, right?\n\n16\n00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,550\nSo we got to see a lot of different\napplications, and with those applications,\n\n17\n00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,825\nwe typically generate files,\nsome kind of output, right.\n\n18\n00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,380\nSomething's gotta come out of them.\n\n19\n00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,780\nAnd those files have\nwhat's called a file type.\n\n20\n00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,920\nNow not every operating system does this,\n\n21\n00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680\nbut most operating systems use\nwhat's called a file extension.\n\n22\n00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,560\nWhen you create a file on the hard drive,\nit has a name,\n\n23\n00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,390\nand the name will be something you said,\nyou, you can call it whatever.\n\n24\n00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,584\nSo maybe it's my resume, right?\n\n25\n00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,322\nSo I know that I'm gonna get fired from\nthis show so I gotta have my backup plan.\n\n26\n00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:35,219\nSo, I create my resume and I call it,\nDon Pezets resume 2014, right?\n\n27\n00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,287\nGotta put a year on there so\nI can remember when I made it,\n\n28\n00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,900\nI don't wanna send someone my old resume.\n\n29\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,279\nWell, that's a name that\nI can use to recognize.\n\n30\n00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,439\nAnd, that's, that's good enough for me.\n\n31\n00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,306\nBut the computer needs to know\nwhat program to use to open it.\n\n32\n00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:52,077\nAnd file extensions are what helps with\nthat, so when I give it a file name and\n\n33\n00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:54,464\nI type in Don Pezets resume 2014,\n\n34\n00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:59,520\nthe computer will then add in a period\nafter that, followed by an extension.\n\n35\n00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,850\nAnd the extensions are normally\nonly three letters, and\n\n36\n00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,690\nthat's a throwback to back in the,\nthe early DOS days, the older file systems\n\n37\n00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,150\ncould only support they called\nit the eight by three file name.\n\n38\n00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,837\nRight?\nYour,\n\n39\n00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:15,330\nyour file name could only be eight\ncharacters and then a period, and\n\n40\n00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,900\nyour extension could\nonly be three characters.\n\n41\n00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,560\nEvery file conformed to this.\n\n42\n00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,250\nAnd it, it was a throwback to really\nthe way old file systems worked.\n\n43\n00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,990\nNew file systems don't have that limit, so\n\n44\n00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,670\nyour file extension could be\nsomething far longer, but\n\n45\n00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,180\npeople still cling to the three letters\nbecause it was so prevalent, right?\n\n46\n00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,470\nI mean, you know, Ronnie,\njust for years it was there.\n\n47\n00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,431\n>> Yeah, I know.\nI just remember having to name files,\n\n48\n00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:36,158\ntrying to figure out eight characters and\n\n49\n00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,496\nwhat could I do to make it\na little bit more descriptive.\n\n50\n00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,677\nAnd being able to do what,\nwhat I needed to.\n\n51\n00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:43,671\nSo, you ended up getting it\nwhere you would kinda do, like,\n\n52\n00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,276\nan acronym as much as you could.\n\n53\n00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,912\nAnd then you'd add dot, and\nthen whatever that extension was gonna be,\n\n54\n00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,349\nyou'd always type that in.\n\n55\n00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,185\nAnd it made it easier for\nyour computer system to be able to,\n\n56\n00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:59,892\nto associate that file with, types of\napplications or a particular application.\n\n57\n00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,490\nSo that's where we,\nwe started seeing that.\n\n58\n00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,320\nAnd now today with the,\nwith the, oncoming of,\n\n59\n00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,190\nof the,\nno longer any limitation to a file name.\n\n60\n00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,500\nNow we can be as descriptive as we want.\n\n61\n00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,260\nAnd it actually makes it a lot easier.\n\n62\n00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,450\nAnd even today, most of those file system\nextensions are, by default, hidden.\n\n63\n00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,290\nBecause most people,\nwe don't really even care about them,\n\n64\n00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,050\nbecause the operating system does such\na good job at being able to extend and\n\n65\n00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,970\nfigure out what particular file\nthat is because it can see it even\n\n66\n00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,570\nthough it's hidden\n>> And, you know, because of that,\n\n67\n00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,890\nbecause it gets hidden,\na lot of us don't even think about it.\n\n68\n00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,670\nPeople who get a new computer today.\n\n69\n00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,920\nIf you get a Windows 8 machine or a Mac.\n\n70\n00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,540\nThose file extensions\nare hidden be default.\n\n71\n00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,270\nYou don't see them you just name the file.\n\n72\n00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,665\nAnd yet there'll be a little icon and the\nicon will match whatever that program is.\n\n73\n00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,186\nAnd, and, so\nyou know the computer recognizes it.\n\n74\n00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,045\n>> Right.\n\n75\n00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,675\n>> And it's just hiding those extensions.\n\n76\n00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,545\nBecause if you change the extension,\n\n77\n00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,405\nyou can make it where the file\nno longer functions, it,\n\n78\n00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,385\nit doesn't know what program to use\nto open it, so it's pretty important.\n\n79\n00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:04,825\nSo, what CompTIA did,\nis they put it under exam objectives,\n\n80\n00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:08,225\nit's really important to know some\nof the major file extensions.\n\n81\n00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:11,805\nAnd so, we've got this giant list, let me,\nlet me pull up the objectives here, and\n\n82\n00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,210\nwe'll, we'll kinda take\na look at CompTIA's list.\n\n83\n00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,450\nSo here we are, we're under 1.2.\n\n84\n00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,090\nAnd, and we covered all this other\n1.2 stuff in our other episode.\n\n85\n00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,020\nBut here's their list\nof common file types.\n\n86\n00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,030\nAnd they divide it up by the types\nof documents we're creating.\n\n87\n00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,974\nSo, so we've got documents,\naudio, images, video,\n\n88\n00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:32,481\nexecutables and compression formats.\n\n89\n00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,218\nAnd these are pretty common extensions\nthat you're going to see as you work with\n\n90\n00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:39,140\nfiles, and for the exam,\nyou need to be able to do two things.\n\n91\n00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,030\nOne, you need to be able to recognize what\neach extension is used for, right, so\n\n92\n00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,960\nwhat its purpose is.\n\n93\n00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,040\nAnd then second, you need to identify\n\n94\n00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,740\nwhich of these file types you\nwould use in different scenarios.\n\n95\n00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,570\nThere are times when one format\nis better than another and\n\n96\n00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,640\nyou've gotta choose the proper one.\n\n97\n00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000\nSo we're gonna take this and divide it up.\n\n98\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,260\nWe'll go through it in\nthe various sections.\n\n99\n00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,040\nAnd we're gonna highlight what\neach of these file types are and\n\n100\n00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,810\nwhy you would use one versus another.\n\n101\n00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,740\nRight?\n\n102\n00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,940\nSo, right, let's kick it off\nat the top with documents.\n\n103\n00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,610\nWhat are, what are document formats?\n\n104\n00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,240\nDocument formats are probably one of\nthe earliest file types that we do have.\n\n106\n00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,740\nBecause everybody really kind of,\nyou know,\n\n107\n00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,300\nstarted off by having to type something.\n\n108\n00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,520\nAnd then when they did they\nended up typing it in, and\n\n109\n00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,620\nit would be opened by\na particular program.\n\n110\n00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,090\nThe earliest ones that I know\nabout are the, the txt files,\n\n111\n00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,290\nwhich are text file systems\nthat we end up having.\n\n112\n00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,941\nSo with the, with the text file system,\nthis is the,\n\n113\n00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:39,040\nthe type of file that is\na s generic as it gets.\n\n114\n00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,089\nPlain vanilla, we really can't do much\nelse with it besides really type it in.\n\n115\n00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,631\nAnd then any changes that we make,\n\n116\n00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:48,740\nit's going to be made\nthroughout the entire document.\n\n117\n00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,950\nSo I have on my screen right here,\na, one that's, I,\n\n118\n00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,890\nI just copied the, the paragraph\nthat describes the IT fundamentals.\n\n119\n00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,040\nAnd then it ends in a .txt and in Windows\nby default, it opens up in notepad.\n\n120\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,770\nSo I just copied it in.\n\n121\n00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,340\nAnd this particular file type can be\nopened up by just about anything,\n\n122\n00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,520\nthat will accept a, a word processor.\n\n123\n00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,080\nSo any word processor will open it up,\nit may add in some formatting.\n\n124\n00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,680\nIt may add in some other things, but\noverall this is where, where it began.\n\n125\n00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,490\nSo you can add in a little bit of,\nof formatting, but\n\n126\n00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,140\nif I change one thing,\neven if I highlight something.\n\n127\n00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,150\nSo just as an example, I won't be doing\nthis too much, but let me highlight that.\n\n128\n00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,180\nAnd if I go to format and font,\nand I try and change the font.\n\n129\n00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,600\nI'm just gonna change it here.\n\n130\n00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,010\nNotice it changes the whole thing.\n\n131\n00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,670\nSo this is really as basic as it gets.\n\n132\n00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,830\nBut once we have that one file type,\nthe nice thing about it is it's\n\n133\n00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,668\nincredibly small because it doesn't\nreally keep any of the other things.\n\n134\n00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:55,640\nSo notice that this one,\neven though it's a paragraph or\n\n135\n00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,789\ntwo long, is about one kilobyte.\n\n136\n00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,270\nBut as we started moving towards newer\nprograms, we started getting away from\n\n137\n00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,770\nsomething, you know,\nas generic as the txt files and\n\n138\n00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,130\nthen we moved into what\nwe called the .rtf.\n\n139\n00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,790\nWhich stands for rich text format.\n\n140\n00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,910\nI like the way that Windows actually\njust has it spelled out for\n\n141\n00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,240\nme so I don't have to guess.\n\n142\n00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,940\nRich text format.\n\n143\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,280\nAnd this one is where we were able\nnow to add in additional formatting.\n\n144\n00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,190\nNow normally it's opened up by default\nin what we call Wordpad on, on Windows.\n\n145\n00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,730\nBut this is another one that's generic.\n\n146\n00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,620\nIf you go to another text document that,\nthat will say hey, I can read in rtf,\n\n147\n00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,990\nyou'll see that, and\neverything actually works fine.\n\n148\n00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,780\nAnd so you'll see that,\nthat this one is, is that.\n\n149\n00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,757\nIt really does help us to keep formatting,\nit allows us to be able to add in,\n\n150\n00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:53,625\nyou know, colors and, and shapes,\nand it's still incredibly small.\n\n151\n00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,323\nBut then from there, CompTIA calls out\nreally kind of Microsoft specific things,\n\n152\n00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,867\nand that's where we moved into the.\n\n153\n00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:05,043\nDocuments, or the dot d o c and\nthe dot d o c x.\n\n154\n00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:10,590\nNow, both of these are Microsoft\nspecific formats that we see here.\n\n155\n00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,370\nThe dot d o c was really what\nMicrosoft Office from '97 to 2003.\n\n156\n00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,306\nAnd then the newer versions, and the,\n\n157\n00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,660\nthis is where they actually\ngenericized a little bit more, right?\n\n158\n00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,030\nWith this dot x, Don,\nwhere they ended up storing it as an XML?\n\n159\n00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,870\n>> Right.\nYeah, in,\n\n160\n00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,400\nin the earlier formats where\nit just ended in dot d o c,\n\n161\n00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,530\nthat was a Microsoft proprietary format,\nit was just them, right?\n\n162\n00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,730\nAnd there were other vendors out there\nlike Open Office that were creating these\n\n163\n00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,020\nopen source products.\n\n164\n00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,590\nAnd, they wanted interoperability with\nMicrosoft but they couldn't get it, and\n\n165\n00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,370\nso, a lot of governments were looking\nat moving away from Microsoft.\n\n166\n00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,350\nMicrosoft said; woah,\nlet's open this up a bit.\n\n167\n00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,530\nAnd, so they switched and now, all of\ntheir data gets stored in XML files.\n\n168\n00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,880\nAnd so, that's when they added the x and\nyou'll see all of their products did that.\n\n169\n00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,570\nYou know, Word, Excel, Power Point,\nthey all went to that new format.\n\n170\n00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,310\nAnd it's kinda funny because we're, we're\ngonna talk about archives a little bit\n\n171\n00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,020\nlater, that when you look at an Office\ndocument, it's actually a ZIP archive.\n\n172\n00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,080\nAnd then if you extract it, inside of\nit are a collection of XML files that\n\n173\n00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,180\nactually have the document configuration.\n\n174\n00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,870\nAnd because they're using\na standard language,\n\n175\n00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,730\nnow third party software\ncan open them just fine.\n\n176\n00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,440\nAnd Microsoft did that because of the\noverwhelming demand from customers for,\n\n177\n00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,610\nfor interoperability.\n\n178\n00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,770\n>> Yeah and here's what we'll see true not\nonly of these regular word processing,\n\n179\n00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,830\nextensions, that we see on these files.\n\n180\n00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,340\nBut even as we moved into\nthe spreadsheet programs,\n\n181\n00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,840\nwhere we started off were as proprietary\nnow a little bit easier to make them\n\n182\n00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,280\ncompatible against other products.\n\n183\n00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,490\nAnd of course, even their presentation\nsoftware is doing the same.\n\n184\n00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,220\nSo I just took that same paragraph and\nessentially made multiple documents.\n\n185\n00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,070\nAnd you see that as the size, more than\nanything else, how big these things get.\n\n186\n00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,555\nSo, it's amazing that the proprietary\none for the, the word document here.\n\n187\n00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:03,150\nIs about 28 K, but then when we went to\nthe, the more open one at about 13, and\n\n188\n00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,740\nthe same thing would be for\nthe the PowerPoint presentation here,\n\n189\n00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,590\nas well as the,\nthe other PowerPoint presentation.\n\n190\n00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,825\nReally small by comparison.\n\n191\n00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:13,325\n>> Yup.\n\n192\n00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:15,535\n>> So, those are,\n\n193\n00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:19,785\nare some of the different document types\nthat you're mo, more likely to run into.\n\n194\n00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:24,541\nIf you need the interoperability, you're\ngoing to choose that newer file type.\n\n195\n00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:29,306\nIf you need more generic, you're probably\ngoing to choose one of the older ones,\n\n196\n00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:31,740\nsuch as the dot r t f or\nthe dot t x t instead.\n\n197\n00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,800\nSo, those may be considerations\nwe want to figure out and know.\n\n198\n00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480\n>> Yeah, that's really\nthe big differentiator right,\n\n199\n00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,070\nin the, in the ones that\nare guaranteed to work everywhere.\n\n200\n00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,980\nYou have text which is\nreally just plain text.\n\n201\n00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,870\nAnd that's what I use all the time for\n\n202\n00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,990\nmy personal stuff because I don't want to\nmess around with formatting or anything.\n\n203\n00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,160\nSo I use that and\nI know I can open it everywhere.\n\n204\n00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,950\nRTF you can still open everywhere but\nnow you get formatting so\n\n205\n00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,710\nif you want it that works out great.\n\n206\n00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,020\nPDF, you get everything right,\nyou can, you can, format that however.\n\n207\n00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,810\nI know we talked about that in,\nin an earlier episode.\n\n208\n00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,830\nThat's that portable document format.\n\n209\n00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,080\nAnd it will open everywhere, but\nit requires a special client.\n\n210\n00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,550\nYou have to have the Acrobat Reader or\nRonnie,\n\n211\n00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,680\nit looks like you have FoxIt Reader\ninstalled, which is a third party one.\n\n212\n00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,890\nBut but it works very similar, but\nit requires that client to do it.\n\n213\n00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,010\nAnd to create PDF's a, a lot of that is,\nis proprietary software with Adobe.\n\n214\n00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,100\nBut then, if you want power.\n\n215\n00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,100\nIf you want ultimate power,\nwell I guess it sounds crazy there.\n\n216\n00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,880\nNot, not like religious power, but,\nbut the, the power to customize\n\n217\n00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,670\na document to its fullest and have,\nhave templates and all of that stuff.\n\n218\n00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,360\nThat's where the Office documents come in.\n\n219\n00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,310\nSo, that's how we kind of choose\nwhich format we're gonna be using.\n\n220\n00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,480\nAll right, so those are the documents.\n\n221\n00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,370\nLet's, let's take a look at\nthe next thing we've got.\n\n222\n00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,670\nThe next thing are the,\naudio files, right?\n\n223\n00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> And let's see,\n\n224\n00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,480\ndo I have my audio files pulled\nup around here somewhere?\n\n225\n00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,070\nLet me move some around-\n>> With the audio files, this is, by far,\n\n226\n00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,220\nthe one that I found the most confusing,\nDon.\n\n227\n00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,190\nCuz there's so many different types.\n\n228\n00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,110\nAnd then when you go and try and, and\n\n229\n00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,960\nbring one in, it may require\na special player to make it work.\n\n230\n00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,600\nSo there's so many different audio types\nwe need to at least know the basic ones.\n\n231\n00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,740\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n232\n00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,270\nNow some of these you guys already know\nit, it's hard to use the internet and\n\n233\n00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,310\nhave not heard of MP3.\n\n234\n00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,370\nMost people when they deal with audio\nfiles are dealing with MP3 files.\n\n235\n00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,610\nSo here I have our ITProTV theme song,\nright,\n\n236\n00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,110\nthe theme song that plays every\nday when the show starts.\n\n237\n00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,520\nAnd and it's right there and\nit's in an MP3 format.\n\n238\n00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,075\nAnd MP3, that actually stands for,\n\n239\n00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,270\nwell it's got an acronym in the, the\n>> Mm-hm\n\n240\n00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,130\n>> Definitions, kind of funny.\n\n241\n00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,289\nIt's MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3.\n\n242\n00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And MPEG, that's the,\n\n243\n00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,390\nthe motion pictures,\nmotion picture experts group?\n\n244\n00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,250\nYes.\n>> Yes\n\n245\n00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,730\n>> Motion pictures experts group\n\n246\n00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,150\n>> And these are the people who\n\n247\n00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,040\nwere really defining video formats,\nbut video has audio right?\n\n248\n00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,613\nAnd so they needed an audio format too and\nMP3 is what they created.\n\n249\n00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,807\nNow, MP3 is the most popular\nway to distribute music on\n\n250\n00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,690\nthe internet right now.\n\n251\n00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,630\nIt's just a very common format.\n\n252\n00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,840\nBut it's what's called a lostful format,\nwhich means when you take audio and\n\n253\n00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,630\nyou convert it into MP3 it's not a perfect\none to one match with the original audio.\n\n254\n00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,300\nNow for most of us, especially me,\nyou can't tell the difference.\n\n255\n00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,050\nI, I cannot tell the difference\nfrom listening to a CD and\n\n256\n00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,070\nlistening to something being played\nfrom MP3, it sounds the same to me.\n\n257\n00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,800\nBut if you're what's called an audiophile.\n\n258\n00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,357\n>> Audiophile.\n\n259\n00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:28,354\n>> These are people that are super\ninto you know music and, and\n\n260\n00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:31,119\ngetting the full experience and stuff.\n\n261\n00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,461\nIf you have high end audio equipment,\nyou can tell the difference.\n\n262\n00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:39,582\nThe MP3s are a little bit less,\nthey, they don't hit the higher and\n\n263\n00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:43,398\nlower pitches as accurately as the,\nthe original audio.\n\n264\n00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:48,410\nAnd so there's other formats we can use,\nthat might correct for this.\n\n265\n00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,000\nOkay, so MP3, that guy right there\nthat's that MPEG-2 Layer 3 that,\n\n266\n00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,360\nor audio layer 3, that steps in and\ndoes that audio piece.\n\n267\n00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,640\nPretty much anything\nwill play it these days.\n\n268\n00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,190\nITunes, Windows Media Player,\nVLC Player, Winamp, your cellphone.\n\n269\n00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,980\nIf you buy stuff from Amazon, or, or\nMicrosoft, you're getting from MP, MP3,\n\n270\n00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,640\nso very, very ubiquitous.\n\n271\n00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,090\nWe see it almost everywhere.\n\n272\n00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,030\nAll right?\n\n273\n00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,240\nSome of the other formats\nyou might bump out there?\n\n274\n00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,940\nWell, WAV files, WAV,\nthat means a wave form audio.\n\n275\n00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,560\nAnd when you, we hear sounds,\nyou're hearing audio waves.\n\n276\n00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,260\nWhat's being kind of thrown out there.\n\n277\n00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,240\nAnd the audio waves in their pure form,\n\n278\n00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,090\ntheir pure, uncompressed form,\nare stored in a wav file.\n\n279\n00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,250\nOf the various options,\n\n280\n00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,580\nthe WAV file is the only one that\naccurately reproduces the sound.\n\n281\n00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,155\nSo when you listen to sound in a WAV file,\n\n282\n00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:44,485\nit is the same as what was\nbeing produced over the airway.\n\n283\n00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,535\nAt least within you know, the tolerances\nof what a computer can handle.\n\n284\n00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,995\nSo that's considered the highest quality.\n\n285\n00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,586\nIf you want the highest quality audio.\n\n286\n00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:55,660\nYou get it in a WAV file, all right.\n\n287\n00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,430\nNow the problem with WAV\nfiles is they're big.\n\n288\n00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,060\nIt's uncompressed audio.\n\n289\n00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,820\nMP3's are small.\n\n290\n00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,140\nThey compress the audio.\n\n291\n00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,390\nIf I look at the file sizes on these,\nthese are all the exact same thing.\n\n292\n00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,106\nThis is all the IT Pro TV theme music.\n\n293\n00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:11,970\nBut in an MP3, it's 308 kb in size.\n\n294\n00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,761\nIn a WAV file, it's 3.7 megabytes.\n\n295\n00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:20,059\nIt's 10 times the size, so\nwhen an MP3 compresses it,\n\n296\n00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,020\nthat's where we start to\nlose that quality, right?\n\n297\n00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,980\nWe're losing some quality to\nmake the files smaller, but\n\n298\n00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,590\nnow it's more portable as far as like\nsending over the internet and so on.\n\n299\n00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,880\nThere's another format out\nthere called FLAC, and\n\n300\n00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,440\nthat's the free lossless audio codec.\n\n301\n00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,918\nAnd it's a open source codec, and\nwhat they do is they came up with a,\n\n302\n00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:47,458\na method to compress the WAV\nfiles without losing audio.\n\n303\n00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,338\nSo they say that, and, and again,\nto me, I can't tell the difference, so\n\n304\n00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,918\nI have to go on what, what people tell me.\n\n305\n00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:56,125\nSo [LAUGH] like my My ears are, are not\nas good as some people's apparently.\n\n306\n00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,712\nBut, what they say is that they can\ncompress the wav file and yet the,\n\n307\n00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:01,788\nthe high tones and\n\n308\n00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:05,820\nthe low tones are all picked up\nexactly as they were in the wav file.\n\n309\n00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,590\nIt's just stored in a smaller format.\n\n310\n00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,470\nIt's trimming out the empty space, is\nwhat it does which a wav file doesn't do.\n\n311\n00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,520\nSo you'll see that ITProTV theme file\nright there is a wav at 3.7 megabytes\n\n312\n00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,110\nas a FLAC it's 1.6\nmegabytes to half the size.\n\n313\n00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,570\nRight?\nSo they save space but\n\n314\n00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,480\ndidn't lose any quality of audio.\n\n315\n00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,200\nAnd then the last one that\n[INAUDIBLE] calls out is m4a.\n\n316\n00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,500\nM4a is a format that Apple uses.\n\n317\n00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,210\nAnd when you buy audio from\nthe iTunes music store,\n\n318\n00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,890\nApple will normally\ndistribute it as an m4a.\n\n319\n00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,790\nAnd the m4a name, it actually\njust stands for mpeg 4 part 14.\n\n320\n00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,030\nSo it's a part of that motion\npicture group, or wait, shoot.\n\n321\n00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,240\nThat's the wrong one isn't it.\n\n322\n00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,776\nDag gonnit.\n\n323\n00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:50,923\n>> No you had the right one\n>> Sorry, no I got it wrong.\n\n324\n00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,310\n>> Okay\n>> So, that, that's a different one.\n\n325\n00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,321\nI was thinking MP4 not M4A.\n\n326\n00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,900\n>> Oh, yup\n>> M4A, it is a funny one because\n\n327\n00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,380\nthe Kodak actually doesn't match\nup with the file extension.\n\n328\n00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,890\nThe, the Kodak is AAC which\nis advanced audio coding.\n\n329\n00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,740\nAnd they use this AAC codec\nto create the m4a files.\n\n330\n00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,990\nAnd I'm not entirely sure why Apple\nchose to go with m4A on the name,\n\n331\n00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,000\nbecause it's aac under the hood.\n\n332\n00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,460\nBut I do know this, they have some\nvariations of it, like their audio books.\n\n333\n00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,980\nWhich are M4B.\n\n334\n00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,190\nAnd so M4A for\nregular audio CDs and stuff and\n\n335\n00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,240\nM4B for their books and the books\nhandle things like chaptering and\n\n336\n00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,010\nbeing able to pick up where\nyou left off and stuff.\n\n337\n00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,200\nSo they do some weird things there.\n\n338\n00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,340\nM4A is really just used by Apple.\n\n339\n00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,960\nYou see very few people\noutside of Apple using it.\n\n340\n00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,090\nAnd one of the main reasons that M4A has\nsome good DRM that they can build into it\n\n341\n00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,920\nwhereas the other protocol the other\ncodecs don't necessary support\n\n342\n00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920\nthat mp3 is pretty weak with it and\n\n343\n00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,655\nso people that distribute music with\ndigital rights management in it, right?\n\n344\n00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:57,345\nThe, the anti-piracy software, prefer\nm4A because it's got that functionality.\n\n345\n00:17:57,345 --> 00:18:00,035\nAnd that's more than likely why they\ndont call it the aac cause it's\n\n346\n00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:04,055\nnot just raw aac anymore,\nit's that with their drm attached to it.\n\n347\n00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:08,065\nSo these are some of the different\nformats and the size is a big concern and\n\n348\n00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,615\nthe compatibility.\n\n349\n00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:13,290\nPretty much everything out there\ncould be able to play an mp3.\n\n350\n00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:13,800\nAll right?\n\n351\n00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,180\nAnd I can see on my computer here\nthat I've got a little a little music\n\n352\n00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,200\nnote right there, which is letting me know\nthat my, my laptop recognized it as music.\n\n353\n00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,430\nAnd if I go to play that, it's gonna fire\nup in whatever default application I have,\n\n354\n00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,130\nwhich is apparently iTunes.\n\n355\n00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,390\nAnd so it's gonna play and- I don't\nknow if you guys can hear this,\n\n356\n00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,640\nthat's, really quiet.\n\n357\n00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,150\nBut but there it is, it's kinda playing\nthat audio music and so on, M4A, wave,\n\n358\n00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,010\nI can see they all play in iTunes.\n\n359\n00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,280\nBut the Mac doesn't have support for\nflack files by default, and\n\n360\n00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,380\nneither does Windows.\n\n361\n00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,210\nSo if you have a Windows machine,\nit doesn't have support for flack either.\n\n362\n00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,780\nSo you'll need additional\nsoftware to play it.\n\n363\n00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,260\nI've got a program called V,\nVLC, which is a,\n\n364\n00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,590\na video land, product,\nvideo land is the company.\n\n365\n00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,140\nAnd VLC, is an open-source video player,\nbut it also supports flag.\n\n366\n00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,370\nAnd so that's why the icon is different\nand if I double-click on this one\n\n367\n00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,810\nit is going to go into VLC and\nhere it is and it's playing it now.\n\n368\n00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,875\nIt will recognizes that flack format.\n\n369\n00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,745\nAll right.\n\n370\n00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:17,885\nSo, when it comes to picking\nwhich audio format you want,\n\n371\n00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,085\nyou gotta think about a couple of things.\n\n372\n00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,195\nThe number one thing is\ngonna be compatibility.\n\n373\n00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,930\nIf you want it to play everywhere, and\n\n374\n00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,820\nbe a nice small file that's easy\nto transmit, MP3 is the way to go.\n\n375\n00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,640\nAnd that's the one that's kind of\nwon out on the internet, all right?\n\n376\n00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,980\nBut if you wanted to be lossless in\nhigh quality a WAV is the way to go,\n\n377\n00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,660\nbut it's gonna be big.\n\n378\n00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,390\nIf you wanted to be lossless but\nsmaller, flack is the way to go, but\n\n379\n00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,410\nyou lose compatibility, right, because\npeople have to load a third party player.\n\n380\n00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,480\nAnd then if you want to work with Apple,\nthen an m4A but Apple does mp3\n\n381\n00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,200\njust fine too, so you'd never really\nfind yourself creating an m4A,\n\n382\n00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,820\nyou'd find yourself more\nreally just getting them.\n\n383\n00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,195\nSo you get m4As, and\nthey'll play fine on Apple.\n\n384\n00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:02,940\nAnd Windows,\nyou may need a third party player.\n\n385\n00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,690\nAll right.\n\n386\n00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,900\nSo those are the predominant audio\nfiles that are out there and\n\n387\n00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,770\nkind of the differences between them.\n\n388\n00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,280\nAll right, Ronny, we've got images next,\n\n389\n00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,540\ndo you think we have\nenough time to do images?\n\n390\n00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,360\n>> We might.\n\n391\n00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,270\n>> Okay, let let's give it a shot.\n\n392\n00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,735\nWe can always stop and\ntake a break from the stream.\n\n393\n00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n394\n00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,210\nWe're now moving on to some\nof the different image for,\n\n395\n00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,290\nfile formats that we also have.\n\n396\n00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,600\nOne of the most popular things, of course,\n\n397\n00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,850\nto do across the internet is\nto go to transfer images and\n\n398\n00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,480\nmake sure that we can actually\nhave them appear on our computers.\n\n399\n00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,210\nAnd, of course, these are the pictures,\nthey are drawings,\n\n400\n00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,710\nthey are photographs, you name it.\n\n401\n00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,490\nThere's so many different\nvariations of these things, but\n\n402\n00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,370\neverybody wants to store\nthem some way digitally.\n\n403\n00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,110\nAnd so, there's many formats and\n\n404\n00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,910\nwe'll take a look at the, kind of\nthe top five different images here.\n\n405\n00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,310\nUsually one of the largest images that we\nhave is what we call the bitmap image,\n\n406\n00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,470\nand that's because it literally\nstores every single dot\n\n407\n00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,520\nof whatever picture that we make, and\nso those things can be very large, and\n\n408\n00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,070\nI just picked a, a Fall background image,\njust as, as a comparison that we could do.\n\n409\n00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,630\nAnd so notice how rich this thing looks.\n\n410\n00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,150\nIt is one of the best looking pictures and\nI,\n\n411\n00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,340\nI'd like to drive on that\nroad right now if I could.\n\n412\n00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, you,\n\n413\n00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,890\nyou see where, where the image is full and\neverything is actually done.\n\n414\n00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,650\nThe nice thing about this image is\nthat we can actually zoom in on it,\n\n415\n00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,230\nwe can crop it away and\nit still looks as good as it does\n\n416\n00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,450\nin the original image that we\nhave with these bitmap images.\n\n417\n00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,130\nThe problem that we have with some\nof the bitmap images is we kind of\n\n418\n00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,220\nzoom in too much and\nzoom out, and zoom in again.\n\n419\n00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,370\nAnd we end up losing some of\nthose bits cuz it has to kind of\n\n420\n00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,730\nremake everything and it, and\nit gets a little bit blurry at times.\n\n421\n00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,990\nBut overall though,\n\n422\n00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,140\nthis is kind of at the high end\nquality of what we normally would see.\n\n423\n00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,440\nOnce we started doing\nthat on the computers,\n\n424\n00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,740\nwe started needing a way to transmit that\nimage and not to lose a lot of those,\n\n425\n00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,380\nthose little things in between as it went\nfrom one computer to another one and\n\n426\n00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,990\nwe had different computer hardware,\ndifferent graphics cards,\n\n427\n00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,540\ndifferent applications that would\nbe able to display the things,\n\n428\n00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,710\nso one of the oldest also\nis what we call the dot TI.\n\n429\n00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:17,140\nNow, I did talk about bitmap, but this\none, TIFF, is a tagged image file format.\n\n430\n00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,850\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And\n\n431\n00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,620\nthis includes a lot of other information\nthat we could make it very easy to,\n\n432\n00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,290\nto say what size this image is supposed\nto be when it gets on the other computer.\n\n433\n00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,710\nAnd it stores a lot of\ncolor information too.\n\n434\n00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,660\nSo this is one these early ones but\n\n435\n00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,090\ncould actually again store a ton\nof information along with it.\n\n436\n00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,270\n>> You know, you're really starting to see\nTIFF files again in the business world\n\n437\n00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,000\nbecause unlike a bitmap where when you\nopen that file it's got one image.\n\n438\n00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,560\nA TIFF can actually store\nmore than one image.\n\n439\n00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,770\nAnd so a lot of document imaging software,\nlike you hear companies where they say\n\n440\n00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,250\nthey've gone all electric, no paper,\nthey are scanning documents that\n\n441\n00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,280\ncome in electronically and a lot of times\nthey will store them in a TIFF because\n\n442\n00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,730\nthey can have more than one\npage in a single image file.\n\n443\n00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,462\nThe, the bitmap format\ndidn't support that.\n\n444\n00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:03,764\n>> Alright.\n\n445\n00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:04,330\n>> Yep.\n\n446\n00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,840\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then there, there are,\n\n447\n00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,100\nthere's actually a couple that,\n\n448\n00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,620\nthat are kind of almost weird competitors,\nin a sense.\n\n449\n00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,250\nThe .gifs, which I have always\nbeen pronouncing wrong.\n\n450\n00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,660\nI thought they were GIF files, but,\ntechnically they're, they're, .gifs.\n\n451\n00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,440\nWhich is the graphics, information.\n\n452\n00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,896\nGraphics interchange format.\n\n453\n00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:23,740\nAnd then the PNG.\n\n454\n00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,520\nThe graphics interchange\nformat was kind of a,\n\n455\n00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,910\nthe, the way that to begin to transmit\nimages, across the internet but\n\n456\n00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,640\nthey didn't really like to do this\nwith things like with what I did here.\n\n457\n00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,380\nSo you had backgrounds that\nwere really just white or\n\n458\n00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,770\nblack or, or\nthings like cartoon or, or shades.\n\n459\n00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,602\nVery good because it can compress a lot\nof the, the stuff that we didn't need,\n\n460\n00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:47,708\nto the point where we made it transparent.\n\n461\n00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:52,000\nBut made it very easily\ntransmittable across, networks.\n\n462\n00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,518\nAnd so it, it was a very popular format\nFor transmitting things like bars, and\n\n463\n00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,293\nfor, for different graphics\nthat we would have in general.\n\n464\n00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:05,309\nBut what happened is that CompuServe was\nreally the big push behind this, and\n\n465\n00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:11,180\nafter a while those developers of GIF\nsaid, look this is what's gonna happen.\n\n466\n00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,390\nWe're going to go ahead and,\nand make it proprietary, so\n\n467\n00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,308\nif you wanna use it,\nyou're gonna pay us money.\n\n468\n00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n469\n00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,450\nit's amazing how often that happens.\n\n470\n00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,610\nAnd that's when people got together and\nstarted producing these .png.\n\n471\n00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,330\nRight?\nPNG stands for portable network graphics.\n\n472\n00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,720\nAnd really about the same, but you can see\nit can store a lot more information a,\n\n473\n00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,210\nalong with, with, with that too.\n\n474\n00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,638\nAnd it still looks the same.\n\n475\n00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,573\nI, I couldn't tell the difference, Don, if\nyou had just shown me an image of all of\n\n476\n00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:41,006\nthem I am not that good, but\nsomebody that's really into photography or\n\n477\n00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:44,519\ninto imaging or, or manipulating\nthese images probably could overall.\n\n478\n00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,516\n>> PNG's, they're, they're very similar to\nGIF's and the only reason PNG's exist Is\n\n479\n00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:53,178\nbecause Unisyf decide to start\nenforcing their license on GIF.\n\n480\n00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:57,021\nAnd so\nthis is like an open sourced protocol.\n\n481\n00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:57,574\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n482\n00:24:57,574 --> 00:24:59,870\n>> Or, or codec algorithm,\nwhatever we want to call it.\n\n483\n00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> Where\n\n484\n00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,100\nthey are just trying to do feature parody.\n\n485\n00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,060\nThey are trying to duplicate\nthe features of GIF and\n\n486\n00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,010\nthere have been a few things\nthat GIF could still do that,\n\n487\n00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,470\nthat PNG's couldn't that they\ncorrected just recently.\n\n488\n00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,204\nLike, you'll hear about animated GIFs,\nwhere it, it looks like a video and\n\n489\n00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:17,500\nit's actually just a series\nof GIF pictures in a row.\n\n490\n00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,310\nPNGs can do that now too.\n\n491\n00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,110\nAnd so, in the 90s,\n\n492\n00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,820\nif you went to a website in the early\ndays of the web, everything was a GIF.\n\n493\n00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,610\nThat was the format.\n\n494\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,000\nToday when you go to websites\nalmost everything is a PNG.\n\n495\n00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,965\nSo Unisys enforced their patent and\nthen it just dwindled after that,\n\n496\n00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:36,640\ncause, you know,\nthere's other alternatives.\n\n497\n00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,130\n>> Right.\n>> But you see, it's less efficient.\n\n498\n00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,770\nI mean, that file is six\ntimes the size of the GIF.\n\n499\n00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,560\n>> And then probably one of the more\npopular file formats that you see is\n\n500\n00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,020\nthe dot JPG.\n\n501\n00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,460\nNow, this used to be a little bit of a,\na stranger ex,\n\n502\n00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,080\nextension name got JPEG.\n\n503\n00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,490\nSo that stands for\nJoint Photographic Experts Group.\n\n504\n00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,520\nAnd I, I would assume that that meant that\nphotographers are really the ones that,\n\n505\n00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,590\nthat were behind this type of, of imaging\nthat, that, that this format that we have.\n\n506\n00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,030\nAnd this is usually the smallest one, and\n\n507\n00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,970\nmost of the, the video or,\nwhy did I say video?\n\n508\n00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:20,200\nImages that we see on web pages are\nprobably gonna be the, these .JPG images.\n\n509\n00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,320\nAnd they scale very easily when, when you\ndon't need a, a large amount of bandwidth\n\n510\n00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,050\nand they display on just about\nany single web page that you see.\n\n511\n00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,240\n>> The problem with JPEGs though and,\nand the reason a lot of people don't\n\n512\n00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,420\nlike them anymore is that\nthey can be a little loss-y.\n\n513\n00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,000\nAnd you don't see it here, right.\n\n514\n00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,499\nSo, so Ronny, can you do a side by side.\n\n515\n00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,834\nWill it let you open two\nimages at the same time?\n\n516\n00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:46,380\nSo if you put a, a PNG and a,\nlet's do a GIF side by side.\n\n517\n00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,972\nOh, oh, yeah there it is.\n\n518\n00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,563\nA png and a, a jpg.\n\n519\n00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:49,364\nWe'll, we'll do that.\n\n520\n00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:50,390\nAlright?\n\n521\n00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,615\nSo, if you look at it like this they,\nthey look the same, don't they?\n\n522\n00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:54,160\n>> Hm-hm.\n\n523\n00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,930\n>> But when you start to zoom in\nyou'll really see the difference and\n\n524\n00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,765\nthe difference is in how\nthe colors are stored.\n\n525\n00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,168\nSo,um, is that be like\nfixed zoom levels or?\n\n526\n00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:03,760\n>> It may.\n\n527\n00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,120\n>> Maybe just zoom all the way in and\nkind of see how that looks.\n\n528\n00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,861\nSo, when you zoom in on that,\n\n529\n00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:12,362\non that PNG see how you're\nseeing those square dots there?\n\n530\n00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:15,467\nAnd on the JPEG when we zoom in,\nyou've got the same thing, and,\n\n531\n00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,248\nwell I guess it kind of looks\nthe same there, doesn't it?\n\n532\n00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:19,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n533\n00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,330\n>> Switch your, the one, the PNG.\n\n534\n00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,260\nSwitch that to the GIF.\n\n535\n00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,486\nIt might be a little\nmore marked in the GIF.\n\n536\n00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,120\n>> Oh.\n\n537\n00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,080\n>> Another browser.\n\n538\n00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,650\n>> Yeah, sorry.\n\n539\n00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,290\n>> Let's,\nlet's see if we can do it that way.\n\n540\n00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> What you normally will see where\n\n541\n00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,181\nthe JPEG actually blurs the image\na bit earlier than the GIF does.\n\n542\n00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:41,200\nThe GIF will stay sharper as you zoom in.\n\n543\n00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,650\nAnd so that's were the,\nthe GIF is a little bit higher quality.\n\n544\n00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,235\nBut it's a different standard.\n\n545\n00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:47,810\nJPEGS can be a little loss-y.\n\n546\n00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,950\nSo when you get a digital camera and\nyou go to take your pictures, there's all\n\n547\n00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,270\nsorts of quality settings you can adjust\nin there to try and correct that.\n\n548\n00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,640\nAnd some cameras will actually do bitmaps\nif you want the high quality stuff.\n\n549\n00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,560\nA lot of photographers that are out there\nif you're a professional photographer,\n\n550\n00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,990\nwill do what's called a raw format.\n\n551\n00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,920\nAnd that raw format is basically a bitmap,\n\n552\n00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,240\nand they're doing that cause\nthey don't want any loss.\n\n553\n00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,350\nAnd that,\nthat's kind of a negative of jpegs.\n\n554\n00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,480\nOut there on the internet you'll see both,\nJPEGs and PNGs and\n\n555\n00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200\nit's because of that\ndifferent way of storing it.\n\n556\n00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,460\n>> You know,\nthis doesn't look much better.\n\n557\n00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,170\n>> And so, well, it,\nit sort of does though, right?\n\n558\n00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,600\nSo, if you zoom in on the right side,\n\n559\n00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,165\nsee how the colors on the left are,\nare really vibrant, well-defined.\n\n560\n00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, the colors on the right\n\n561\n00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,135\nare a lot dimmer, right?\n\n562\n00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:28,980\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight.\n\n563\n00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,080\nAnd, I, I, I guess, we were kind of,\nlooking at different places.\n\n564\n00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,890\nIt's almost not fair.\n\n565\n00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> But but, what do is, is,\n\n566\n00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,460\nyou're actually losing a little\nbit because the JPEG is,\n\n567\n00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,500\nis really blurring some\nof the bits together.\n\n568\n00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,510\nSo Windows is artificially making it look\nlike those are well defined squares, but\n\n569\n00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,430\nthey're actually bits.\n\n570\n00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,170\nAnd in the JPEG,\nthey get blurred together.\n\n571\n00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,640\nAnd in the GIF, they're kept separate.\n\n572\n00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there, there is a, a little bit of,\n\n573\n00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,330\nof loss with JPEGs.\n\n574\n00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,280\nThe PNGs are larger, but\nthey create crisper images,\n\n575\n00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,950\nand so that's where people\nare starting to move to PNGs.\n\n576\n00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,320\nYou know personally, like my,\nmy family photos and the stuff I store,\n\n577\n00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,530\nI've got them all in PNG.\n\n578\n00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,010\n>> Yeah,.\nYou know it's kind of interesting that\n\n579\n00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,970\nyeah, you know how everybody looks at,\nat imaging differently.\n\n580\n00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,300\nWhereas the, the, the JPEGs, these\nphotographers that came together said,\n\n581\n00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,920\nlook, we,\nwe know something about the way that,\n\n582\n00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,915\nthat visually light hits the eye,\nthat we're willing to put up with,\n\n583\n00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:22,465\nlike light and dark, but\nnot shades of variation too much.\n\n584\n00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:23,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, so\n\n585\n00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,000\nthey really focused their\ncompression around that\n\n586\n00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,230\n>> Whereas other ones,\n\n587\n00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,580\nwe want to see these clear distinctions,\nbut we're not so worried about color.\n\n588\n00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,360\nSo everybody does it\na little bit differently, so\n\n589\n00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,600\ndepending on the need, that, that's what\nyou end up seeing that you choose, and,\n\n590\n00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,424\nof course, the size\n>> If you're going to just be doing this\n\n591\n00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:43,178\non the internet, most of the time\nwe just want a very small and\n\n592\n00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:44,260\nfast loading webpage.\n\n593\n00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,374\nJPEGs may be the way that we end up going.\n\n594\n00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:47,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n595\n00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,764\n>> All right, well, Ronny, that is\na pretty good spot for us to stop and\n\n596\n00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:51,360\ntake a break.\n\n597\n00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,750\nWhen we get back, we've still got,\nwhat do we have, video,\n\n598\n00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,698\nexecutables, and compression.\n\n599\n00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:57,316\n>> Right.\n>> So quite a few more file types to\n\n600\n00:29:57,316 --> 00:29:57,934\nget through.\n\n601\n00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:01,893\n>> So let's stop here and take a break and\nwe'll pick back up in just a moment.\n\n602\n00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:07,395\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,125\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n604\n00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,545\nSo, in this segment, we're gonna take\na look at a few other video formats, and,\n\n605\n00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,075\nand now we're gonna jump into video.\n\n606\n00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,585\nI, I made a mistake earlier,\nwhen I was doing my acronym, and I,\n\n607\n00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:19,535\nI mentioned the video one.\n\n608\n00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:22,375\nSo, I'm, I'm apparently very\nexcited to see that video.\n\n609\n00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,695\nSo so let's take a look.\n\n610\n00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:28,215\nThere are a number of different\nvideo formats that are out there.\n\n611\n00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:31,830\nFortunately, CompTIA only calls\nout some of the most popular.\n\n612\n00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,850\nThere's literally hundreds of different\nformats when you go to different sites,\n\n613\n00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,840\nvideos are presented to\nyou different ways, but\n\n614\n00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,990\nthese five right here\nare really the most common.\n\n615\n00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,890\nAnd so let's run through a few of these\nand, and kind of where they, they start.\n\n616\n00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,180\nLet's go, what order do I wanna go in?\n\n617\n00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,220\nWell I guess we can go in,\nin CompTIA's order.\n\n618\n00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220\nSo, they start with MPEG,\nand what I've got here,\n\n619\n00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,720\nthese are some little promos we did.\n\n620\n00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,500\nWe had our, our IT pro TV one year\nbirthday party the other day and, and\n\n621\n00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000\nI had to record some promos.\n\n622\n00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,500\nSo this is some of our promo footage that\nwe shot and I've got it in an MPEG format.\n\n623\n00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,700\nNow of all the formats that we're gonna\ntalk about, MPEG is the highest quality.\n\n624\n00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,840\nThe way it works is when you have a,\na video, a video is actually just a series\n\n625\n00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,700\nof pictures that are played through very,\nvery quickly, and that's what MPEGs do is\n\n626\n00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,990\nthey take a bunch of pictures, and\nit's usually 30 frames per second.\n\n627\n00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,930\nAnd they call them frames, right.\n\n628\n00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,900\n30 frames per second,\n\n629\n00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:32,050\nso every second of video is 30\npictures played in rapid succession.\n\n630\n00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,870\nAnd to the human eye,\n\n631\n00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,590\nthat's fast enough to trick us into\nthinking that that's full motion.\n\n632\n00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,682\nIt's the same way that,\n\n633\n00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:40,500\nthat motion picture cameras work\nat the theater and, and so on.\n\n634\n00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,606\nSo when you look at an mpeg file if its\none minute long, well, that's 60 seconds\n\n635\n00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:50,875\nand it was doing 30 frames per second for\n60 seconds that's 1,800 frames.\n\n636\n00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,542\nIn that one little file.\n\n637\n00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,627\n1,800 pictures strung together.\n\n638\n00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,583\nAnd so, MPEG files can be\npretty big because of that.\n\n639\n00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,774\nThat's a lot of pictures all independent,\nall stored in there, but\n\n640\n00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:04,690\nit's very high quality cuz each picture\nis really independent, all right?\n\n641\n00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,170\nThe longer the video is,\n\n642\n00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,470\nthe bigger that file is going to get, but\nMPEGs will get you the highest quality.\n\n643\n00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,200\nAnd MPEG just stands for the motion\npicture experts group, it was a,\n\n644\n00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,770\na video organization, a conglomeration of\nengineers and video designers and so on.\n\n645\n00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,322\nThat got together that created this format\nworrying about quality, not anything else,\n\n646\n00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:27,510\nall right?\n\n647\n00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,170\nNow, video is usually\naccompanied by audio, also.\n\n648\n00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,430\nAnd so the MPEG format allows for an audio\nstream to be tacked in there, too.\n\n649\n00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,060\nSo it's not just pictures, but\nthere's audio intermixed with it.\n\n650\n00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,410\nAnd there's different formats for\nthat audio.\n\n651\n00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,400\nSo they had to create a standard, and this\nis where the MPEG name comes into play.\n\n652\n00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,210\nIs that with MPG, they have a couple\nof different variations, and\n\n653\n00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,100\nnormally when you see an MPG,\nit's actually the MPEG 2 format.\n\n654\n00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,710\nAnd that's a format that defines exactly\nhow video and audio will be stored and\n\n655\n00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,850\nmultiple audio formats in the event that\nyou want to do surround sound, and stereo,\n\n656\n00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,650\nyou know, there's different audio types.\n\n657\n00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,370\nForeign language tracks can\nall be stored in there,\n\n658\n00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,710\nall as a part of this video file.\n\n659\n00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,210\nSo, it's a very complex file.\n\n660\n00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,000\nRight?\n\n661\n00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,050\nBut for most of us, it's too big.\n\n662\n00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,870\nThis is really the format that's\ndesigned to be used on DVDs.\n\n663\n00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:22,200\nWhen you buy a DVD, the video that's\non there is typically in MPEG format.\n\n664\n00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,730\nAll right?\n\n665\n00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,190\nAnd it's big, the DVDs have to be\nbig to store all that, but that,\n\n666\n00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,940\nthat's the format that's used.\n\n667\n00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,160\nFor us on our personal computers, though,\nif we're putting videos up on the Internet\n\n668\n00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,770\nand so on,\nthese MPEGs can be really large.\n\n669\n00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,060\nLet me show you the final sizes.\n\n670\n00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,630\nThis video is a little\nover one minute in length.\n\n671\n00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,360\nAll right?\n\n672\n00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,490\nAnd, if I fire that up here,\nlet me just open it.\n\n673\n00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,930\nAnd, now that's a perfect picture\nto start with right there.\n\n674\n00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,970\nBut you can see, you know,\nhere's me doing my, my promo.\n\n675\n00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,130\nApparently I'm standing\nthere like a moron.\n\n676\n00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,763\nAnd there we go.\n\n677\n00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,979\nSo, so here I am talking and\nyou can see that this video,\n\n678\n00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,765\nit is roughly one minute long.\n\n679\n00:33:55,765 --> 00:34:00,438\nI think it's like one minute and eight\nseconds or something, yeah, one minute and\n\n680\n00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,390\neight seconds.\n\n681\n00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,780\nAll right, and in that one minute,\nthat MPEG file was 77 megabytes in size.\n\n682\n00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,090\nIf your average movie is two hours long,\n\n683\n00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,250\nat 77 megs per minute,\nthat adds up pretty quick.\n\n684\n00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,940\nAnd so your average movie will\nnormally be between like two and\n\n685\n00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940\nfour gigabytes in size, it's big.\n\n686\n00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,150\nBut the quality is really good.\n\n687\n00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,000\nThat's what we tape in.\n\n688\n00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,950\nWhen we do our recordings, we tape in\nMPEG for the high quality, all right?\n\n689\n00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,300\nBut for distributing on the internet,\nthat's not really suitable.\n\n690\n00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,760\nAnd so we have to take that and\nconvert it into formats that will\n\n691\n00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,930\nplay well on your computer,\non your cellphone, on your tablet.\n\n692\n00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,890\nThat'll stream over the internet\nwithout pausing and buffering.\n\n693\n00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,970\nAnd won't run up your data cap so\nwe convert to other formats.\n\n694\n00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,240\nSome of the other formats\nthat are available, MP4.\n\n695\n00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,058\nMP4 is probably the most popular format\nand with MP4, that, that stands for\n\n696\n00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:51,146\nthe MPEG-4 part 14,\nthat's what I was jumping into earlier,\n\n697\n00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:54,671\nit also came from the same\nmotion picture experts group.\n\n698\n00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:57,240\nAnd it's a compressed video.\n\n699\n00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,480\nIt takes the MPEG, and\ninstead of storing separate pictures for\n\n700\n00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,330\nevery single frame,\nit stores a picture for the first frame.\n\n701\n00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,250\nAnd then every frame that\nfollows just stores the changes.\n\n702\n00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,610\nRight?\nWhat changed from the last frame?\n\n703\n00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,860\nAnd that results in a much,\nmuch smaller file.\n\n704\n00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,780\nBut, changes can be hard to measure\nwhen you've got things like fog on\n\n705\n00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,835\nthe screen, right?\n\n706\n00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:21,510\nCuz fog is constantly changing,\nyou see this in war movies all the time.\n\n707\n00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,990\nWhen they have, the fog is out there and\nthe soldiers are running through it and\n\n708\n00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,626\nyou start to see pixellation around it and\nMPEG-4 is not so\n\n709\n00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,963\ngreat with things like that.\n\n710\n00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:32,043\nSo it is a little bit lossy and\nyou'll see the file got smaller, and\n\n711\n00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,978\nhere, it didn't get that much smaller.\n\n712\n00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:38,937\nBut, sometimes, you will see where\nit is 25% of the size of other ones,\n\n713\n00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:42,190\nit can be a huge space\nsavings when you go to MP4.\n\n714\n00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,820\nWe produce MP4's here for streaming, and\nwe actually keep them at a very high\n\n715\n00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,500\nquality, and so\nour size reduction is not that great.\n\n716\n00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,411\nAnd that's because we are sending it up to\na video service that's then proceeding to\n\n717\n00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,305\nre-encode it so\nwe have to keep our quality high here.\n\n718\n00:35:55,305 --> 00:36:00,310\nBut you'll find when you make MP4s,\nthat they're typically much, much smaller.\n\n719\n00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,290\nAll right, so MP4s,\nthey're what's called a container format.\n\n720\n00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,400\nInside of an MP4, there's actually\nvarious video formats you can use,\n\n721\n00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,242\nthings like h.264, and all other types.\n\n722\n00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:12,790\nThere are different types of audio,\nMP3, AAC,\n\n723\n00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,480\nyou have all sorts of different\nformats inside of there.\n\n724\n00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,890\nBut, the MP4 itself is\njust a definition for\n\n725\n00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,180\nwhat type of content is inside of it,\nand it is the most common.\n\n726\n00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,190\nThis is, is what you see mostly.\n\n727\n00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,760\nAll right.\nThe next one that we've got is FLV.\n\n728\n00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,970\nFLV is the first one that you'll notice\nmy, my Mac doesn't recognize, right?\n\n729\n00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,750\nWhen I do my thumbnail view, see how my\nMac has a nice little picture there for\n\n730\n00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,720\nthe MP4, a nice picture for MPEG.\n\n731\n00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,340\nIt's got built-in support form them so\nit's showing a thumbnail.\n\n732\n00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,010\nAll right.\n\n733\n00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,600\nBut these other formats,\nit doesn't have built-in support.\n\n734\n00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,910\nSo it's relying on other\nprograms to play them.\n\n735\n00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,220\nAnd, for this one, like AVI,\nmy QuickTime player is picking that up.\n\n736\n00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,935\nBut for the FLV and WMV,\nit's another program called VLC,\n\n737\n00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:57,995\na third-party program I've installed.\n\n738\n00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:01,455\nSo, the first two, those are gonna\ngive us the best compatibility.\n\n739\n00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:04,359\nA lot of people will support those\nnatively, and not need anything special.\n\n740\n00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:07,738\nThese other ones require\nthird-party players, all right?\n\n741\n00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:12,812\nFLVs were super popular up\nuntil about six years ago,\n\n742\n00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:18,040\nFLV is from Adobe and\nit stands for Flash Video.\n\n743\n00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,430\nAdobe Flash is a plugin\nthat's installed on some 90,\n\n744\n00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,730\nwhat is it like 95% of\ncomputers on the internet?\n\n745\n00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,740\nIt's, it's over 90%.\n\n746\n00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,770\nIt's a ridiculous amount.\n\n747\n00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,690\nFor Flash embedded objects and webpages.\n\n748\n00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,340\nIt used to be that if you\nwent to a webpage and\n\n749\n00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,070\nyou saw a video,\nit was being played in Flash.\n\n750\n00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,660\nAnd if it was an interactive webpage,\n\n751\n00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,110\nif it was a web game that you were playing\nclicking on things, it was done in Flash.\n\n752\n00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,333\nAnd up until about six years ago,\nFlash dominated the internet.\n\n753\n00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,563\nAnd so, even today,\nwe still see Flash player around and\n\n754\n00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:49,186\nit's a really good player.\n\n755\n00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:53,352\nIt's proprietary though, Adobe made it and\nyou've go to pay licensing fees to Adobe,\n\n756\n00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:54,491\nbut it's really good.\n\n757\n00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:59,771\nWell, even today, you still see, like,\nour site if you go to ITProTV or\n\n758\n00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:04,429\nitpro.tv to watch a video,\nit tries to do Flash first if you had it.\n\n759\n00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:08,380\nAnd if you don't, then it moves over to\nHTML5, a different way to play things.\n\n760\n00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,680\nWe try Flash first cuz we know it\ncreates a better video quality.\n\n761\n00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,760\nAll right?\n\n762\n00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,080\nBut, if it creates a better video quality,\nwhy don't people use it anymore?\n\n763\n00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,000\nWell, what happened is Apple decided\nthey didn't like Flash anymore.\n\n764\n00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000\nAnd so Apple said, you know what,\nwe're not gonna support it.\n\n765\n00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,680\nAnd so when they released their iPhones\nand their iPads, there's no Flash support.\n\n766\n00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,780\nAnd those devices are really,\nreally popular.\n\n767\n00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,370\nMillions of people use iPhones and\niPads and Adobe was saying, well,\n\n768\n00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,510\nyou can support us if you want.\n\n769\n00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,250\nAnd, and Apple, particularly Steve Jobs,\nsaid no, I think I'll pass.\n\n770\n00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,650\nAnd so, everybody else now had to try and\nfind some kind of alternate method, and\n\n771\n00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,650\nFLVs kind of went away.\n\n772\n00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,540\nAnd now we see MP4s that\nare being streamed and\n\n773\n00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,120\nyou can stream them with Flash player\nif you want, that's what we're doing.\n\n774\n00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,800\nOr you can stream them with HTML5 or\nvarious other players that are available.\n\n775\n00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,284\nSo you kind of see this\nmovement away from that.\n\n776\n00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:02,063\nSo, FLVs, you could only create with\na program that was called Adobe Flash, and\n\n777\n00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:05,500\nactually Adobe Fireworks would do it too,\nthey had two programs.\n\n778\n00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,040\nBut Adobe Flash would create it and\nit's the same video, if I fire that up,\n\n779\n00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,050\nit's the same video, you'll see the same\nthing, the quality is not as good.\n\n780\n00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,130\nYou'll see there's some\ngraininess around my face there.\n\n781\n00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,550\nFLVs were never good\nabout motion tracking, so\n\n782\n00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,150\nthere's some degradation in there.\n\n783\n00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,200\nAnd, the file size is where\nthere big improvement is.\n\n784\n00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,840\nOf most of my files here,\nit's very small, at 26 megs.\n\n785\n00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,065\nThat's have the size of the original MPEG.\n\n786\n00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:34,390\nAll right,\nanother one that's out there is WMV.\n\n787\n00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,644\nThat is the Windows Media Video,\nor Window Media Player Video.\n\n788\n00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:41,152\nMicrosoft has the Windows Media Player,\nand\n\n789\n00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:45,250\nthe Windows Media Player has native\nsupport for a file format called WMV.\n\n790\n00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,625\nNot many other people support it.\n\n791\n00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,083\nIt's really just a Microsoft thing.\n\n792\n00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,391\nAnd the reason they created it was not\nthat it does its job better than anybody\n\n793\n00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,250\nelse But because it has digital\nrights management support in it.\n\n794\n00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,846\nYou can put licensing in there, so\nif Ronnie, if you go out and buy a video,\n\n795\n00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:00,833\nyou can play it on your computer,\nbut I can't play it on mine.\n\n796\n00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:01,417\n>> Mm.\n\n797\n00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,125\n>> Or you can play it on one computer,\nbut not on a second one, right?\n\n798\n00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,310\nThey can enforce rights on it.\n\n799\n00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,480\nAnd people really hate DRM, and\nas a result, WMV is not very common.\n\n800\n00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,784\nBut you do see some websites out there\nthat are using it, typically with the DRM.\n\n801\n00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,920\nAll right, and\nthe last one I've got is AVI.\n\n802\n00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,270\nAVI, that is the,\nI always have to look this one up,\n\n803\n00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,620\nis the Audio Video Interleave.\n\n804\n00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,170\nThis was one of the earlier video formats\nthat would let you combine audio and\n\n805\n00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,470\nvideo together.\n\n806\n00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,130\nIt's fairly lossy, because it does extreme\ncompression, 13.7 megabytes, right?\n\n807\n00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,810\nThat is like a quarter, or\n\n808\n00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,680\nalmost a quarter of what the original\nfile was, in this case, very small.\n\n809\n00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,360\nAnd you see AVIs still used today in some\nplaces, where people will like Rip a DVD.\n\n810\n00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,530\nThey'll copy a DVD to their computer,\nbut they'll want it to be smaller,\n\n811\n00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,480\nmaybe to fit on a CD, or\njust take less space.\n\n812\n00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800\nYou can use AVIs to do it.\n\n813\n00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,400\nAVI support has kinda dwindled in the last\nfew years, but if I fire this one up,\n\n814\n00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,730\nit'll launch, and oh actually,\nQuickTime is having to convert it.\n\n815\n00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,840\nThat's funny.\nSo it doesn't natively play it.\n\n816\n00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,190\nLet me let me open it in VLC instead.\n\n817\n00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,680\nVLC'll natively play it.\n\n818\n00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,380\nSo, if I open it up here,\nyou can see extreme loss\n\n819\n00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,640\naround my face as I move there, as I\ndo the free product placement for Coke.\n\n820\n00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,970\nBut you know, extreme loss in there,\nAVIs were not about quality.\n\n821\n00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,390\nThey were about compression,\nand in the old days,\n\n822\n00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,920\nyou had limited hard drive space,\nand that was a big deal.\n\n823\n00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,290\nAnd because of that, because of the crummy\nvideo, very few people use AVIs anymore.\n\n824\n00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,320\nAll right.\n\n825\n00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,250\nSo, when it comes to picking\nwhich video format to use,\n\n826\n00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,600\nthe things we have to think about are\nthe file size and compatibility, right?\n\n827\n00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,243\nMPEG gives us the highest quality,\nbut the files are huge, but\n\n828\n00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:46,980\nthe compatibility is great.\n\n829\n00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,581\nEverybody can use them, right?\n\n830\n00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:49,995\nMP4?\n\n831\n00:41:49,995 --> 00:41:53,495\nCompatibility is great,\nfile size is smaller, but\n\n832\n00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:56,275\nthey they lose a little bit of quality.\n\n833\n00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:58,145\nThey're a little bit lossy, right?\n\n834\n00:41:58,145 --> 00:41:59,733\nNot as bad as AVIs, right?\n\n835\n00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:03,205\nAVI's terrible quality,\nnot a lot of people can play them,\n\n836\n00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:05,895\nnot great compatibility,\nbut great on file size.\n\n837\n00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:08,750\nThese are the pros and cons that we\ngo through when we select things.\n\n838\n00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,050\nBut MP4 and MPEG, those are the two big\nones right now that we see with video.\n\n839\n00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,990\nEasy to confuse with MP3, right?\n\n840\n00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,630\nWhich is just audio.\n\n841\n00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,200\nIt came out of the same group\nMP3 is an audio format for\n\n842\n00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,660\nstoring inside of an MPEG, right?\n\n843\n00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,754\nWhich I'm now playing in my phone now.\n\n844\n00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:25,782\nBut you can, you can do that.\n\n845\n00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:29,647\nBut but MP3 is just audio, no video.\n\n846\n00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,284\nMPEG is audio and video.\n\n847\n00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:35,516\n>> You know, these particular formats,\nespecially the audio and the video that we\n\n848\n00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,652\njust talked about, they're really popular\nbecause of the, the way that home\n\n849\n00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:42,002\nentertainment centers are actually you\nknow, becoming really big in the market.\n\n850\n00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:42,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n851\n00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,563\n>> So,\nit's something we shouldn't confuse,\n\n852\n00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,065\nsomething we should be able to identify.\n\n853\n00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:48,944\nSo get used to seeing\nthose formats especially.\n\n854\n00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:49,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n855\n00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,916\nI know me so we have,\nI love to watch movies, right?\n\n856\n00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:57,500\nI don't watch regular TV, I don't watch TV\nshows, but I love watching movies, and so\n\n857\n00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,680\nI have a lot of DVD's.\n\n858\n00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,630\nAnd it is well over 200 DVDs.\n\n859\n00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,240\nAnd it was such a pain keeping track of\nthose, and they get scratched, and so on.\n\n860\n00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,160\nSo, I took all my DVDs, and\nI converted them into MP4s.\n\n861\n00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,820\nAnd I store them on a, a server.\n\n862\n00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,880\nI call it a server,\nit's really my desktop at home.\n\n863\n00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,660\nAnd we can stream that to\nany TV in the house, and\n\n864\n00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,090\nI don't have to worry about discs anymore.\n\n865\n00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,170\nSo we boxed up the DVDs,\nstuck them up in the attic.\n\n866\n00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,810\nAnd there they sit today.\n\n867\n00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,280\nBut but now, we've got 'em.\n\n868\n00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,490\nThere was a little bit of lost\nquality when I went to MP4,\n\n869\n00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,400\nbut now I can pick whatever movie\nI want whenever I want, and\n\n870\n00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,740\nview it, and you know,\nit works out really well.\n\n871\n00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,518\nI could have gone MPEG,\nwhich is what I was doing originally, I,\n\n872\n00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:34,701\nI was running out of storage,\nit was so much space.\n\n873\n00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:38,148\nSo that's kinda how we go through\npicking which one we want.\n\n874\n00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,864\n>> And a lot of it is about\nthe compatibility with the devices\n\n875\n00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:41,549\nthat we have.\n\n876\n00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:44,306\nSo, instead of actually just picking\none and go, I want the best,\n\n877\n00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:47,726\nyou may actually have to pick it where it\nwill play on your iPho-, on your iPhone.\n\n878\n00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:48,248\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n879\n00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:50,562\n>> Or your iPad, as well as on your PC,\n\n880\n00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:54,818\nas well as on your nice\nsmart TV if you needed to.\n\n881\n00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:57,510\nSo that's normally the reason why we\nactually pick one over the other.\n\n882\n00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,210\n>> All right.\nWell, Ronnie, what's our,\n\n883\n00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,320\nwhat's our next group?\n\n884\n00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,230\n>> Our next group here is,\ntaking a look at executable files.\n\n885\n00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,500\nExecutable files that\nwe're most familiar with,\n\n886\n00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,770\nthose types of files when we need to\ninstall something on our computer.\n\n887\n00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,160\nSo the, the executable stands for that.\n\n888\n00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,730\nActually it stands for something\na little bit older like a boot strapper,\n\n889\n00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,880\nI think it is what it's\noriginally stood for.\n\n890\n00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,920\nWhich allows you to click on it, and\nthen it runs a series of commands to\n\n891\n00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,320\nbe able to begin the installation\nprocess of whatever we want to install.\n\n892\n00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,250\nNow, our, our list here actually the more,\n\n893\n00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,195\nmost familiar ones, are the .exes,\nand we'll talk about MSIs.\n\n894\n00:44:34,195 --> 00:44:35,550\nAnd even batch, the,\n\n895\n00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:40,290\nthe only one that's a little bit\nstrange is actually this SC EXE one.\n\n896\n00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,150\nSo, so let's start off with, with just\nthe ones that we're most familiar with.\n\n897\n00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,670\nMore than likely, if you go and\n\n898\n00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,900\ndownload a file from the Internet to,\nto download and install.\n\n899\n00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,280\nIt's probably gonna come\nin one of these two\n\n900\n00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,450\nformats if you're on a Windows computer.\n\n901\n00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:58,552\nA .exe, or a .msi, and if you've\nactually installed either one of them,\n\n902\n00:44:58,552 --> 00:45:00,946\nyou're probably wondering like,\n\n903\n00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:05,112\nI, I really don't see a lot\nof difference in them at all.\n\n904\n00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:06,773\nWhen, when, it,\nit just looks like it runs.\n\n905\n00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:07,619\nIt just looks like a,\n\n906\n00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,499\na different three letter character\nat the end of the name here.\n\n907\n00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n908\n00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,547\n>> So there, there's probably reasons why,\nwhy there are MSIs, and\n\n909\n00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,579\nthere's reason why there, there are EXEs.\n\n910\n00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:23,120\nA normal, regular installer is\nprobably just gonna be a .exe.\n\n911\n00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,130\nIt has everything that it\nneeds to install the program\n\n912\n00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,620\nthat it wants to run on your computer,\nand will work just fine.\n\n913\n00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,530\nIt tends to also to check and verify\nthat we have the things that we need to,\n\n914\n00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,230\nto make sure that it will install,\nand run fine.\n\n915\n00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,271\nSome of them that might need you know,\nother support,\n\n916\n00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:44,970\nsuch as saying, hey, I need to make\nsure that there's a .net framework.\n\n917\n00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,990\nI can't remember what,\nwhat I was trying to remember.\n\n918\n00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,380\n.net framework, it, it can check that.\n\n919\n00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,920\nAnd then we're ready to go,\nand it finishes and installs.\n\n920\n00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,430\nOr it may tell you hey, you need to\ninstall this first before we go on.\n\n921\n00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,804\nSo, .exes are very popular,\nvery easy to, to run.\n\n922\n00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,577\nAnd then you, you post 'em up,\nand, and you're ready to go.\n\n923\n00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:05,590\nThe .msi is the Microsoft, and\n\n924\n00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,710\nhere they tall it,\ncall it the Windows Installer Package.\n\n925\n00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,930\nIt really is almost like\na container type of format.\n\n926\n00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,400\nJust like what Don was talking about,\na little bit earlier.\n\n927\n00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,490\nThat adds in a little bit of,\nof extra information.\n\n928\n00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,890\nNow, you may be wondering what,\nyou're just installing a file.\n\n929\n00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,550\nWhy would I ever need that?\n\n930\n00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,590\nWell, usually this is designed for\nscripting.\n\n931\n00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,265\nSo, if you wanted to,\nto be able to deploy,\n\n932\n00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:34,332\nthis across maybe your entire network.\n\n933\n00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,214\nAnd you wanted to call on\nthat package to install,\n\n934\n00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,418\n.msis are really designed for that.\n\n935\n00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,940\nNow, can you run them individually,\none on one?\n\n936\n00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,010\nSure, you can.\n\n937\n00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,420\nBut normally,\nthat's the reason why we also do that.\n\n938\n00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,320\n>> Yeah, you know, and\nwe use these in our more advanced shows.\n\n939\n00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,270\nBecause, when you normally run an install,\nor\n\n940\n00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,440\nlike Ronnie, if you run that\nFileZilla installer, right?\n\n941\n00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,870\nWhen you normally run an installer,\nit ask you a bunch of questions.\n\n942\n00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,390\nYou gotta sign your user agreement.\n\n943\n00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,123\nYou gotta pick a directory to install in,\n\n944\n00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:02,520\nhere it's asking you if you wanna upgrade,\nright?\n\n945\n00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,410\nSo, it ask you a bunch of questions.\n\n946\n00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,290\nBut if you wanna deploy this across\na network to other computers,\n\n947\n00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,760\nyou don't want it to ask\nany questions at all.\n\n948\n00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,140\nYou want it to be silent.\n\n949\n00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,900\nAnd to do that, you need a way to give it\nan answer, and MSIs are how you do that.\n\n950\n00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,980\nSo Microsoft Installer Packages,\nyou provide the answers, and\n\n951\n00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,510\nyou can do what's called a silent install.\n\n952\n00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,460\nYou run it, and it installs\nthe software in the background, and\n\n953\n00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,850\nthe user doesn't have to interact with it.\n\n954\n00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,190\nSo network administrators\nuse this all the time.\n\n955\n00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,370\nMicrosoft has a,\n\n956\n00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,770\na software package you can download\nfrom them that lets you make the MSIs.\n\n957\n00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,290\nAnd there's third parties that do it, too.\n\n958\n00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,671\nI know we've used Orca is,\n\n959\n00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:38,310\nis the, the one from Microsoft that we\nuse internally, if you wanna make those.\n\n960\n00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,700\nAnd you, you're just providing\nthe answers for the install.\n\n961\n00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,960\nAnd when you go to\ndownload from a website,\n\n962\n00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,290\nthey'll usually give you a choice\nbetween the .exe, and the .msi.\n\n963\n00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,340\nIf you're a regular user, if you're\njust installing it on one machine,\n\n964\n00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,417\nuse the .exe,\nyou need to answer the questions.\n\n965\n00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,645\nBut if you're a network admin, and\nyou're deploying to a bunch of computers,\n\n966\n00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:56,250\nuse the .msi, you can script with it.\n\n967\n00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,125\nThat, that's really the big\ndifference between the two.\n\n968\n00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:58,833\n>> Yeah.\n\n969\n00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,499\nNow one-, once you install though, so\n\n970\n00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,439\nif you were to install FileZilla,\nwhich you've already got running,\n\n971\n00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:06,440\nuh,can you browse through the,\nthe program directory for FileZilla.\n\n972\n00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:08,460\n>> Maybe.\n\n973\n00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,208\n>> I think it's 32 bit only, right?\n\n974\n00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n975\n00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,290\n>> So so when FileZilla installed this\nclient, it has an exe of its own.\n\n976\n00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,220\nSo exe's aren't always installers, right?\n\n977\n00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,890\nYou'll usually use one to install but once\nit's done an exe is any program that runs.\n\n978\n00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:30,060\nSo, he installed this FTP client and\nthere it is Filezilla.exe.\n\n979\n00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,660\nAnd, if you double click on that,\nRonnie, it'll just run the program.\n\n980\n00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,190\nRight.\n\n981\n00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,520\nSo there he is and\nthere's already a new version.\n\n982\n00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,632\nHow awesome is that.\n\n983\n00:48:37,632 --> 00:48:41,330\nSo, [LAUGH] so, so there's the program and\nwhen you look at your start menu and\n\n984\n00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,810\nall those icons.\n\n985\n00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,730\nThey're normally pointing\njust to exe files\n\n986\n00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,340\nright there on the hard drive Hard drive.\n\n987\n00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,140\nSo, Microsoft Word, and\nExcel, all those other guys,\n\n988\n00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,040\nthey're just exe's right\nthere on the hard drive.\n\n989\n00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,540\nNow, Ronnie, you only talk about Windows,\nwith exe's and\n\n990\n00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,070\nMSI's\n>> I did\n\n991\n00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,760\n>> Why don't you talk about Mac or Linux.\n\n992\n00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,000\nWhat, what about the other OS's.\n\n993\n00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,245\n>> Because they don't really matter.\n\n994\n00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:02,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, no, not really.\n\n995\n00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,680\nThey, they don't use them.\n\n996\n00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,500\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, they, they don't work.\n\n997\n00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,190\n>> They don't work.\nYeah.\n\n998\n00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,280\n>> Right?\nExe and MSI,\n\n999\n00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,860\nthat's just a Microsoft thing.\n\n1000\n00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,410\nIn Linux environments,\n\n1001\n00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:15,130\nin, in Mac, they're really basically the\nsame executables don't use an extension.\n\n1002\n00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,270\nYou actually just flag a file\nas being executable, and\n\n1003\n00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,480\nthat's how it knows to do it,\nit has no extension attached to it.\n\n1004\n00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,240\nSo, when you see exe and .msi, that's\nMicrosoft, that's the Windows world.\n\n1005\n00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,760\n>> Our other file, oop, format, that we\ncall out, if I can't change it back here.\n\n1006\n00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,150\nLet's see if I can get back to our,\nis the batch file.\n\n1007\n00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,400\n>> Sorry,\nI got you off track there [LAUGH].\n\n1008\n00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,480\n>> No that's fine,\nI just had to come back.\n\n1009\n00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,522\nAnd, I'm not going to run this one\ncause it will restart my computer.\n\n1010\n00:49:41,522 --> 00:49:42,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cause I went ahead and made it.\n\n1011\n00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,950\nSo a, a batch file was really made in\nthe days of our disk operating system\n\n1012\n00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:53,270\nDOS that ran from a command line\ninterface instead and it would allow you\n\n1013\n00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,750\nto run commands but things that you need\nrepeated or you could string together and\n\n1014\n00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,000\ninstead of having to type in every\nsingle one of those commands to do so.\n\n1015\n00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,280\nWhat you could do is save them as a file\nthat ended in the extension called .bat\n\n1016\n00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,280\nand then you could just need to type\nin that name and it would run now.\n\n1017\n00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,350\nLike I said I need to be careful [LAUGH]\nright click and, and, edit instead.\n\n1018\n00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,690\nSo here I went ahead and created just\na simple command where I just tell it,\n\n1019\n00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,430\nhey don't report to me anything.\n\n1020\n00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:29,260\nBut change over to the Windows system32\ndirectory, and run this shutdown command.\n\n1021\n00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,560\nAnd then I added in a couple of options.\n\n1022\n00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,480\nThe dash r here to restart and\nthen the dash t for\n\n1023\n00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,300\na time, for it to wait before it restarts.\n\n1024\n00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,230\nAnd then a zero unless that's,\nthat's an o.\n\n1025\n00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,360\nI can't tell.\n\n1026\n00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,690\n>> It does look that like that.\n\n1027\n00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,370\n>> It does look like an o.\n\n1028\n00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,740\nNope, that's a zero, so.\n\n1029\n00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,010\n>> Huh.\n>> I was like yeah,\n\n1030\n00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:49,310\na dash o is not gonna work,\na dash 0 works just fine and so\n\n1031\n00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,540\nwe used to use this when we needed to do a\nlot of those repeatable commands, over and\n\n1032\n00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,757\nover again, so instead of having\nto type in two or three commands,\n\n1033\n00:50:56,757 --> 00:50:58,580\none command would end up working.\n\n1034\n00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,830\nNow Don, today, even though batch files\nare still around, a lot of times,\n\n1035\n00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,738\nWindows also recommends you use a .vbs and\nwe don't really call that out.\n\n1036\n00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:10,990\nBut the .vbs it just opens\nyou up to more commands,\n\n1037\n00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:15,800\nwhereas the .batch is really\nlimited to those DOS commands and\n\n1038\n00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,900\nthat's why you still see them around\ncuz it's easy, they still work\n\n1039\n00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,200\ninstead of actually needing to, to add\nin so many more other things with the,\n\n1040\n00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,670\nwith the other things that you can\nadd in with the virtual basic script.\n\n1041\n00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,540\nVisual basic script, virtual basics.\n\n1042\n00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,350\nVisual basic scripting.\n\n1043\n00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,560\nSo you'll still see these.\n\n1044\n00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,410\nAnd they're probably\nnot gonna go anywhere.\n\n1045\n00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,750\n>> Yeah.\nThere, there's a bunch of\n\n1046\n00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,460\ndifferent scripting formats\nthat are out there.\n\n1047\n00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,970\nThe, the batch file, the .bat, that, that\nname batch, it's just a batch of commands.\n\n1048\n00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,590\nIt's a collection of commands\nthat it's gonna run in order, and\n\n1049\n00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,590\nthere's some basic logic\nyou can put in there.\n\n1050\n00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,980\nYou can do like if then loops and\nstuff very simple things.\n\n1051\n00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,020\nBut it doesn't give you a ton of power.\n\n1052\n00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,490\nThe other formats,\nthings like Power shell scripts,\n\n1053\n00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,970\nwhich are dot PS1,\nvisual basic scripts dot VBS.\n\n1054\n00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:06,870\nYou've got like the Asher pearl, or\nthose are usually in dot PL, or dot SH.\n\n1055\n00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,340\nThose guys,\nthey're all scripting languages, and\n\n1056\n00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,910\nthey need a script interpreter to run.\n\n1057\n00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,920\nSo, you can't just run them\nright from the command line,\n\n1058\n00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,370\nlike normal, you've got to have\nan interpreter to handle them.\n\n1059\n00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,590\nSome of us have that built in, some don't.\n\n1060\n00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:22,150\nBut all of those other languages give\nyou a ton more power you can do full\n\n1061\n00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,810\nprogramming logic as you go through and\ndevelop whatever it is that you need,\n\n1062\n00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,024\nso for those of you that moved\nbeyond the basic training, when you,\n\n1063\n00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:33,245\nyou move into like the, the Linux shows,\nif you want to learn Linux plus, we,\n\n1064\n00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:36,540\nwe show how to do some,\nsome scripting in there.\n\n1065\n00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,960\nIn some of the more advanced Windows\nshows, we show how to do, like, logon\n\n1066\n00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,910\nscripts that will map network drives and\ncopy software, and things of that nature.\n\n1067\n00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,810\nSo there's a lot of powerful stuff\nyou can do with scripting, but your\n\n1068\n00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,310\naverage end user is never going to write a\nscript or even run a script in their life.\n\n1069\n00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,720\nIt's going to be invisible to them,\n\n1070\n00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,320\nthey won't deal with it cuz if you're\njust doing something on one computer,\n\n1071\n00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,140\nit's normally faster to just do\nit than to write a whole script.\n\n1072\n00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,280\nBut if you're doing something on a\nthousand computers, you write a script so\n\n1073\n00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,365\nyou can run it all at once, and that's\nthat big differentiator between them.\n\n1074\n00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:07,890\nYeah.\n\n1075\n00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,200\n>> We have two more file formats we need\nto talk about for the executables, and\n\n1076\n00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,750\none is one I can't run on my computer\nsince it's Windows computer,\n\n1077\n00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:21,170\nwhich is the dot APP the Apple\npackage is what this one is for.\n\n1078\n00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,840\nAnd so this is the one that's designed for\nApple to be able to do their updates.\n\n1079\n00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,535\n>> Yeah so, what, what ha-,\nwhat happens Windows, right?\n\n1080\n00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:30,955\nOn, on your computer,\nRonnie, can you go back.\n\n1081\n00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:32,145\n>> Sure.\n>> To the FileZilla folder?\n\n1082\n00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:34,585\n>> Sure.\n>> When Ronnie installed FileZilla,\n\n1083\n00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:37,425\nit installed a ton of stuff, right?\n\n1084\n00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:39,265\nSo it made a folder on his hard drive.\n\n1085\n00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:42,630\nAnd then there's all these files\nthat are a part of FileZilla.\n\n1086\n00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,990\nRight Windows stores all those separately.\n\n1087\n00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:48,370\nApple said, well let's try and\nmake that a little more simple.\n\n1088\n00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,040\nAnd so what they did is they\ntook all those files and\n\n1089\n00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,580\nthey just combined them into one big file,\nright?\n\n1090\n00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,680\nAnd it's the dot app file.\n\n1091\n00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,660\nSo in, in your, your Mac, lets let\nme see if I can show you guys this.\n\n1092\n00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,810\nAll right, so here, here I'm on my Mac,\nand I'm in my applications folder.\n\n1093\n00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,180\nAnd here I can see different applications.\n\n1094\n00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,190\nYou'll see I've got\nFileZilla installed also.\n\n1095\n00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,280\nWe, we like FileZilla here.\n\n1096\n00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,290\nIt makes us happy.\n\n1097\n00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,780\nSo so I've got FileZilla.\n\n1098\n00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,620\nThere it is.\n\n1099\n00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,275\nAnd it's just represented\nby a single icon.\n\n1100\n00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:19,715\nEven if I go into detail view,\nit's still just that single icon,\n\n1101\n00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,345\nthere's nothing special about that.\n\n1102\n00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,125\nAnd if I pull up this\ndetailed information,\n\n1103\n00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,015\nit tells me it's an application, but\nnowhere in here does it say, well,\n\n1104\n00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:32,030\nI guess, right there FileZilla.app,\nso there's that file extension,\n\n1105\n00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,580\nthat's where that's coming from.\n\n1106\n00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:38,110\nAnd, what they don't tell you is\nthat it is actually a directory.\n\n1107\n00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,710\nSo, if I come in here and\nI find it let me just find it, here it is,\n\n1108\n00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,770\nhere's FileZilla.app.\n\n1109\n00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:51,390\nAnd I can actually change into that,\nand look inside of it.\n\n1110\n00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:57,740\nAnd here I can find all those little files\nthat are a part of that application.\n\n1111\n00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,840\nHere's all this stuff.\n\n1112\n00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,740\nThese project files and\nother components that are a part of it.\n\n1113\n00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,225\nAnd this is all the stuff that Windows is\njust storing right on the hard drive but\n\n1114\n00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:08,525\nan app only stored in one file.\n\n1115\n00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:12,315\nAnd the nice part about that is, when\nyou install an application on an apple,\n\n1116\n00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:15,695\nyou just drag this one file and\ndrop it, and it's installed.\n\n1117\n00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:18,155\nAnd if I want to uninstall it\nI just drag this one file and\n\n1118\n00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:20,210\nI throw it in my trash and\nthen it's gone, right.\n\n1119\n00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,560\nSo, it's just to make\nlife a little easier.\n\n1120\n00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,000\nIt doesn't change the way\nthe application works,\n\n1121\n00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,170\njust a different way of storing it,\nso that's the Dot app.\n\n1122\n00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:32,820\n>> Our last one is the only that's really,\nI-\n\n1123\n00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,892\n>> I was gonna say [CROSSTALK].\n\n1124\n00:55:33,892 --> 00:55:35,872\n>> Yeah, I mean, we,\nwe can't run around any of this.\n\n1125\n00:55:35,872 --> 00:55:42,712\nThe .SCEXE, and it took awhile to even\nfind out what that actually meant, Don.\n\n1126\n00:55:42,712 --> 00:55:45,256\n>> Yeah. Yeah. >> I, I looked for\nit and I've, like, so\n\n1127\n00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:48,783\nfinally I had to, to do a,\none of those weird searches where I,\n\n1128\n00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:53,333\nI put .SCEXE in quotation marks, so\nit wouldn't find individual characters.\n\n1129\n00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,984\nAnd finally, there was one guy that\nblogged and I said, it actually stands for\n\n1130\n00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:59,542\nsmart, I can't remember what it stands for\nnow.\n\n1131\n00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:02,747\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Smart component Executable and\n\n1132\n00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:07,447\nthis is a Linux type of updater,\nbut when I, I went to try and\n\n1133\n00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:13,125\nfind out more about it, the only people\nthat are using it is HP servers.\n\n1134\n00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, so\n\n1135\n00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,740\nthis is a special update file\nthat's really very compact.\n\n1136\n00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,660\nBut really designed, it looks like,\nreally, for one use.\n\n1137\n00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,870\n>> Yeah.\nHewlett-Packard uses these to distribute\n\n1138\n00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:28,510\nfirmware updates, so their hardware ships\nwith logic on board that's, you know,\n\n1139\n00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,440\nmaking decisions and handling your data.\n\n1140\n00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,570\nAnd, you'll need to update\nthat periodically as they\n\n1141\n00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,050\npatch problems that have been\ndetected in the hardware.\n\n1142\n00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,430\nSo when they create a firmware update,\nthey will attach it in,\n\n1143\n00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:43,440\ninside of this sc.exe format,\nand on their systems,\n\n1144\n00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,150\nthey'll have software that's able to\nexecute that and update the firmware.\n\n1145\n00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,680\nBut on any other system, it won't work.\n\n1146\n00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,570\nSo, when you get those sc.exes,\n\n1147\n00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,550\nthey are designed to run on one specific\nset of hardware and nothing else.\n\n1148\n00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,405\nAnd unless you have that identical\npiece of hardware, it's either,\n\n1149\n00:56:58,405 --> 00:57:02,730\none: not gonna work or two: gonna really\nhose things up at a hardware level and\n\n1150\n00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:03,730\nyou don't want that.\n\n1151\n00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,553\nSo, these are just firmware updates and\n\n1152\n00:57:05,553 --> 00:57:08,674\nI think the main reason that Comptia\nadded it to the exam objectives.\n\n1153\n00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:10,074\nWas to just show that,\n\n1154\n00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:13,838\njust because there's exe in\nthat extension name, doesn't\n\n1155\n00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,280\nmean that it is an actual executable\nthat you can run on a normal system.\n\n1156\n00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,760\nIt might be specialized.\n\n1157\n00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,500\nAnd so you can see variations of\nyour file extensions some times.\n\n1158\n00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,783\n>> Yeah, and speaking of something that\nDon had pointed a little bit earlier too,\n\n1159\n00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:27,702\nnotice that I have all\nthese different icons.\n\n1160\n00:57:27,702 --> 00:57:30,768\nFor the ones that my system would\nrecognize, but here on Windows,\n\n1161\n00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:33,856\nif it doesn't recognize it,\nit just makes it a little blank file.\n\n1162\n00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:34,505\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So,\n\n1163\n00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:38,335\neven though it's sees it as being a file,\nand it can see what the extension is,\n\n1164\n00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:41,586\nit doesnt have any clue of how to\nidentify that with anything that it\n\n1165\n00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:42,340\nknows-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1166\n00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,632\n>> So it leaves it as a nice little blank.\n\n1167\n00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:45,575\n>> All right, so be aware there, you know,\n\n1168\n00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:48,294\nthere's always new file\nextensions that are out there and\n\n1169\n00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:52,195\nsometimes you have to look it up to figure\nout what the, the program is that runs it.\n\n1170\n00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:55,004\nBut the, the ones that we're highlighting\nhere, with the exception of that one,\n\n1171\n00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:55,585\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1172\n00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:58,766\n>> Are pretty common ones that\nyou're gonna see out and about.\n\n1173\n00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,758\nAll right, well, Ronny we still have\ncompression formats to get through,\n\n1174\n00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:04,670\nwhich we actually have quite a few of,\nand we're out of time for this segment.\n\n1175\n00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,365\nSo let's stop here and\ntake a break, and when we get back,\n\n1176\n00:58:07,365 --> 00:58:10,335\nwe're gonna talk about archives and\ncompression formats, and\n\n1177\n00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:13,910\nsome of the different ones that are out\nthere and how to pick between them.\n\n1178\n00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,030\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1179\n00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,609\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1180\n00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:24,109\n[MUSIC]\n\n1181\n00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,040\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1182\n00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,440\nSo in our final segment,\nwe're gonna take a look at\n\n1183\n00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,740\nwhat Comptia has labeled as\ncompression formats, right?\n\n1184\n00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,130\nOr, or compressed files.\n\n1185\n00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,180\nThere's a number of different utilities\nout there, that are generally called\n\n1186\n00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,310\narchivers, and what the archivers\nallow us to do is two things.\n\n1187\n00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:49,880\nOne, we can compress files, you can take a\nfile that's large and make it very small.\n\n1188\n00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,170\nAnd the other thing they allow us\nto do is to take multiple files and\n\n1189\n00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,420\ncombine them into one big file, right?\n\n1190\n00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,500\nSo, for example, let's say that I\nhad a couple of pictures, right?\n\n1191\n00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,730\nSo I went on vacation, I took a few\npictures and I'm on the phone with\n\n1192\n00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,320\nRonny and Ronny says hey, Don,\ncan you send me some of those pictures?\n\n1193\n00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,590\nI would love to see what\nyou're talking about, right,\n\n1194\n00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,670\nmaybe I'm at the Grand Canyon.\n\n1195\n00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,120\nI'm like, yeah, yeah, Ronny, I'll send\nyou these pictures of the Grand Canyon.\n\n1196\n00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,470\nWell, most email systems have a limit of\nten megabytes on the size of an email.\n\n1197\n00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,380\nThat's, that's the most\ncommon email size limit.\n\n1198\n00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,350\nAnd if I look at my photos, and\nthey're 12 megs total, right?\n\n1199\n00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:23,890\n12 megabytes.\n\n1200\n00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,010\nToo big, I can't send them by email.\n\n1201\n00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,790\nSo I could go and use some other service.\n\n1202\n00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:34,590\nOr, I could fire up an archive utility and\ncompress the image, if it was one or\n\n1203\n00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:39,220\nmultiple images, into a smaller file and\ntry and get it under that ten meg limit.\n\n1204\n00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,240\nAnd now I can send it to Ronny,\ncuz it's a smaller file.\n\n1205\n00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,768\nArchive utilities were really popular\nback in the old days when we used\n\n1206\n00:59:45,768 --> 00:59:46,883\ndial-up modems.\n\n1207\n00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,220\nDial-up modems were very, very slow.\n\n1208\n00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:53,970\nAnd so, if you had to download a large\nfile, it would take hours upon hours.\n\n1209\n00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,210\nIt really would take a long time.\n\n1210\n00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,290\nBut if you could compress the file and\nmake it smaller,\n\n1211\n00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,160\nit took less time to download.\n\n1212\n01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,070\nOn today's world, we have much greater\namounts of bandwidth that are available,\n\n1213\n01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,590\nand so archivers started becoming less and\nless popular.\n\n1214\n01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:10,230\nBut now, a lot of our providers\nare enforcing data caps, and so.\n\n1215\n01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,600\nCompression's back in full swing again,\n\n1216\n01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,500\nwe see a lot of people using archivers to\ncompress that data and make it smaller.\n\n1217\n01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,660\nAll right.\n\n1218\n01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,940\nBut just the bulk file thing,\nif I wanna send ten files to Ronny,\n\n1219\n01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,180\nif I send ten files individually,\nhe's gotta download ten files.\n\n1220\n01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,430\nIt'd be nice if I could send him\none file that had all ten in it.\n\n1221\n01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:29,370\nAnd then he could extract it\non his side and he'd have it.\n\n1222\n01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,290\nSo, that's the two sides of compression.\n\n1223\n01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,708\nCompression is combining and\nshrinking files.\n\n1224\n01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:39,906\nExtraction is where we uncompress,\nright, we bring it back to full size and\n\n1225\n01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:42,878\ndrop them onto the hard drive\nin their original form.\n\n1226\n01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:47,232\nAll right, now, there are a number of\ndifferent utilities that can do that, and\n\n1227\n01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:49,856\nComptia calls out how\nmany do they call out,\n\n1228\n01:00:49,856 --> 01:00:53,329\neight eight different formats\nthat you might see out and about.\n\n1229\n01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:56,600\nAnd each one's a little bit different so\nI'm gonna go through each one.\n\n1230\n01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,640\nNow, to demonstrated this, I decided to\nuse a file here as my sample, all right?\n\n1231\n01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,320\nI picked the novel War and\nPeace by Leo Tolstoy.\n\n1232\n01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,100\nRonny and I have this running joke.\n\n1233\n01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,230\nRonny, you have actually read War and\nPeace.\n\n1234\n01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,290\n>> I have read War and Peace.\n\n1235\n01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,178\n>> From cover to cover?\n\n1236\n01:01:13,178 --> 01:01:14,177\n>> Cover to cover.\n\n1237\n01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:17,290\n>> [LAUGH] You are a man of patience and\nperseverance.\n\n1238\n01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,230\nIt's not a bad novel.\n\n1239\n01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:19,820\n>> No.\n\n1240\n01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,770\n>> It's just got to be one\nof the world's longest.\n\n1241\n01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,778\nNow it is insanely long.\n\n1242\n01:01:24,778 --> 01:01:27,440\nSo, this was basically the biggest\nbook that I could think of and it's in\n\n1243\n01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,830\nthe public domain so I went to the Project\nGutenberg website and I downloaded it.\n\n1244\n01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,110\nAnd, where'd it go, here it is.\n\n1245\n01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,970\nSo here is War and Peace, and\nbasically, it's got, you know,\n\n1246\n01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:43,180\njust a, a ton of chapters, and here it is.\n\n1247\n01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,480\nYou just see it scrolling by.\n\n1248\n01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,380\nI'm getting bored from just scrolling.\n\n1249\n01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,330\nThis is, is really an insanely long novel.\n\n1250\n01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:53,370\nAll right, so, that novel,\nin an uncompressed format,\n\n1251\n01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,110\nI have it stored right here as just a TXT,\njust a text file, and\n\n1252\n01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:02,650\nin raw text,\nthat file is 3.3 megabytes in size.\n\n1253\n01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,300\nNow, if I'm just looking to\ncombine multiple files together,\n\n1254\n01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,730\narchiving, then that file's\nnot gonna get any smaller.\n\n1255\n01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,860\nIf I had five files that were this size,\nthen the archive I create would\n\n1256\n01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,150\nbe a little bit bigger than 16 megs,\njust combining all the files together.\n\n1257\n01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,300\nBut if I wanna shrink it, I need\na compression algorithm to shrink it down.\n\n1258\n01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,880\nAnd most of the time,\nthose two are offered together.\n\n1259\n01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,290\nArchive and compression, all in one, but\nthat's not always the case so let's,\n\n1260\n01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,800\nlet's look at some of these.\n\n1261\n01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,090\nThe most popular one, I, I'm gonna go\nout of order from Compti on this one.\n\n1262\n01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,370\nThe most popular one is called zip.\n\n1263\n01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:39,750\nRight, the zip file extension,\nit doesn't actually stand for anything.\n\n1264\n01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,730\nThey, they picked zip because\nit meant you can go fast, right?\n\n1265\n01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,510\nYou know zipping through something.\n\n1266\n01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,490\nWhat zip would do is it would\ncompress your files and\n\n1267\n01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,490\nif there was more than one file,\nit would combine them into one.\n\n1268\n01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:55,010\nAnd so, I took old Leo Tolstoy's novel and\nI compressed it with zip.\n\n1269\n01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,670\nAnd you'll see that it became about\none-third of the size of the original.\n\n1270\n01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,997\nSo, uncompressed,\nthat text was 3.3 megabytes.\n\n1271\n01:03:02,997 --> 01:03:05,249\nCompressed, it's 1.2 megabytes.\n\n1272\n01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:07,478\nAll right, now, how did it achieve that?\n\n1273\n01:03:07,478 --> 01:03:11,317\nWell, what they do is they look for\nbits throughout the document that\n\n1274\n01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:16,081\nare identical, and instead of storing it\nmore than once, it says, well, you know,\n\n1275\n01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:18,947\nI can, I can see there's a THE here and\na THE there.\n\n1276\n01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:22,442\nAnd they're written the same way, and\nso we can convert that into a hash and\n\n1277\n01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:25,935\njust say this hash goes here and here and\nhere, and all of a sudden the word,\n\n1278\n01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,430\nthe, is basically eliminated from\nthe document, and it shrinks.\n\n1279\n01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,020\nAnd it does that with all sorts of\nrecurring characters throughout it.\n\n1280\n01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,200\nThere's, there's a little more to it,\nright?\n\n1281\n01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,210\nA lot of these compression algorithms\nwe're going to talk about are patented\n\n1282\n01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,770\nand, and copyrighted.\n\n1283\n01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:45,710\nZip is one of the few ones that is\nfairly open about letting people use it.\n\n1284\n01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:49,250\nSo, zip is the most popular,\nnot because it's the best, but\n\n1285\n01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,330\nbecause the most people support it.\n\n1286\n01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,626\nIf you create a zip archive,\npretty much anybody can open it.\n\n1287\n01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:59,362\nAnd most operating systems, like Windows\nand MAC OS, have native support for zip,\n\n1288\n01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:00,708\nand anybody can use it.\n\n1289\n01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:04,969\nIf you wanna combine some files You\ncan just right-click on them and\n\n1290\n01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,625\nhere I've got compress.\n\n1291\n01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:10,759\nOn Windows you had a Send To menu and\nCompress ZIP would be an option and\n\n1292\n01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:14,010\nit'll actually create the ZIP file for\nyou.\n\n1293\n01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,235\nThere's the one that it just made,\nall right?\n\n1294\n01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:18,225\nSo your operating system\nmay do it natively, or\n\n1295\n01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:20,985\nyou might use a third-party program.\n\n1296\n01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:25,435\nOn the Mac, I use a program called\nEntropy and this guy right here.\n\n1297\n01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:29,285\nAnd I can throw files in there and\nchoose to archive it.\n\n1298\n01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:30,595\nAnd when I go to archive it,\n\n1299\n01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:34,875\nit's gonna ask me way down here\nat the bottom of the screen,\n\n1300\n01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:38,645\nwhich apparently I can't move, but\nright here, which archive format I want.\n\n1301\n01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:40,970\nAnd look at all those choices I have,\nall right?\n\n1302\n01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,750\nSo what's that all about?\n\n1303\n01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,470\nWell, ZIP is the most popular\nbecause it's supported everywhere.\n\n1304\n01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,090\nBut there's other formats you\nmight want to choose from.\n\n1305\n01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,800\nSo that's the rest of the ones\nthat CompTIA is listing.\n\n1306\n01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,910\nBut it is pretty uncommon to see\nsomething other than ZIP out there.\n\n1307\n01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,800\nAll right, so\nlet's run down the list of the other ones.\n\n1308\n01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,120\nThe first one CompTIA calls out is RAR,\nall right?\n\n1309\n01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,770\nRAR RAR, however you wanna say that.\n\n1310\n01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:08,900\nIt stands for Roshal Archive,\nwhich is named after the creator,\n\n1311\n01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,000\nAlexander Roshal,\nhe's the one who made it.\n\n1312\n01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,310\nAnd it is a, a compression\n\n1313\n01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,630\nprotocol that was designed just to provide\nbetter compression than ZIP, all right?\n\n1314\n01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,480\nAnd it does it.\n\n1315\n01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,090\nIf you look at my ZIP that I made for War\nand Peace, it was 1.2 megabytes in size.\n\n1316\n01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,810\nWhen I did it with RAR\nnow it's only 1 meg,\n\n1317\n01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,420\nin size so,\nit saved 200 kilobytes of space.\n\n1318\n01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,480\nIt's just a tighter compression algorithm,\nright?\n\n1319\n01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,440\nThe only problem with RAR is that very few\nsystems have native support for it, right?\n\n1320\n01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,990\nMost Unix systems do er, Linux systems,\nbut Mac OS doesn't and Windows doesn't.\n\n1321\n01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,048\nSee how I don't have\na little colored icon there?\n\n1322\n01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:48,540\nIt's a RAR file that\ndoesn't know what to do.\n\n1323\n01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,260\nSo you'll need third party\nsoftware to be able to open that.\n\n1324\n01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,740\nOn Windows you might use\nsomething like 7-zip or WinRAR.\n\n1325\n01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,080\nOn Mac I use Entropy, but\n\n1326\n01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,800\nthere's other ones you can use that\nare available to extract that.\n\n1327\n01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,590\nThe text file is in there its\njust in a different format\n\n1328\n01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,160\nthat's more aggressive, all right.\n\n1329\n01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,670\nBut if compatibility is what you're\nlooking for RAR is not the way to go.\n\n1330\n01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,570\nThe next one they call it is TAR, T-A-R.\n\n1331\n01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:14,970\nNow TAR is the first one that we\nencounter that doesn't do both.\n\n1332\n01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,600\nIt doesn't do compression and archiving.\n\n1333\n01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,490\nIt just does archive.\n\n1334\n01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,850\nTAR stands for tape archive.\n\n1335\n01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:25,955\nThis was originally developed for\nwhen people were doing backups to tape.\n\n1336\n01:06:25,955 --> 01:06:29,045\nWhen you backup to a tape,\nlike a cassette tape,\n\n1337\n01:06:29,045 --> 01:06:32,345\nyou're actually taking multiple files and\nstringing them together.\n\n1338\n01:06:32,345 --> 01:06:36,365\nAnd so, you need to know where one file\nends and where the next one starts.\n\n1339\n01:06:36,365 --> 01:06:38,135\nAnd that's all a TAR file does.\n\n1340\n01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:42,910\nIt takes your original files lays them\nout and marks where they begin and\n\n1341\n01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,110\nend so we can tell the files apart.\n\n1342\n01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:49,030\nSo TARs don't do any compression,\nand when you look at my War and\n\n1343\n01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,946\nPeace document here, this txt is 3.3 megs.\n\n1344\n01:06:51,946 --> 01:06:54,756\nWhen I put it in a TAR it's 3.3 megs.\n\n1345\n01:06:54,756 --> 01:06:55,481\nIt's no different.\n\n1346\n01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:56,845\nAll right?\n\n1347\n01:06:56,845 --> 01:07:00,440\nIf I open that file up,\nsee I'm gonna open this TAR.\n\n1348\n01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,380\nI'll open that with Entropy, right?\n\n1349\n01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,228\nThere's War and Peace and it's 3.3 megs.\n\n1350\n01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:07,144\nYou know, it,\nit really wasn't compressed at all.\n\n1351\n01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:09,660\nThe size and compressed size are the same.\n\n1352\n01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,450\nVersus if I open that RAR.\n\n1353\n01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:17,780\nIf I open that one up,\nI can see the size is 3.3 mgs,\n\n1354\n01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,640\nbut the compressed size is 1 mg.\n\n1355\n01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,320\nRight.\nThis one did archive, and\n\n1356\n01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,270\nI could have more than one file here and\nit did compression together.\n\n1357\n01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:26,840\nTAR doesn't do that.\n\n1358\n01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,950\nTAR is really from the UNIX world.\n\n1359\n01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,940\nSo we use TAR a lot in UNIX and\nLINUX based systems, and\n\n1360\n01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:35,330\nwe normally combine it with\nsomething else, right?\n\n1361\n01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,990\nSo it only does archiving,\nit'd be nice if we had something else and\n\n1362\n01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:42,070\nthe something else is this guy right here,\nGZ.\n\n1363\n01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:47,155\nGZ stands for gzip,\nwhich is something that stands for\n\n1364\n01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:51,880\nGNU-Zip and GNU acronyms in the acronym.\n\n1365\n01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,286\nThat's, that's something that GNU likes to\ndo, they always do acronyms in acronyms.\n\n1366\n01:07:56,286 --> 01:07:59,454\nIn fact, GNU stands for\nGNU is not Unix, so it,\n\n1367\n01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:03,283\nit's got its own name in\nthe defin- just whatever.\n\n1368\n01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:06,009\nAll right.\nSo, gzip though, does compression, and\n\n1369\n01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:08,101\nthat's what its primary focus is.\n\n1370\n01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:11,550\nIt doesn't do archiving,\nit just does compression.\n\n1371\n01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:15,370\nIt's a open-source library that anybody\ncan use to compress and uncompress.\n\n1372\n01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:21,250\nAnd so in the Linux and Unix world,\nwe normally combine the two, TAR and gzip.\n\n1373\n01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:25,413\nSo it's not uncommon to get\na file that ends in .tar.gz.\n\n1374\n01:08:25,413 --> 01:08:27,218\nIt's got both, right.\n\n1375\n01:08:27,218 --> 01:08:29,360\nLetting you know that\nthey've applied both.\n\n1376\n01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:33,800\nOr sometimes you'll see .tgz, which will\nindicate that both have been done to it.\n\n1377\n01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,780\nBut GZ or gzip is technically\na separate program from TAR.\n\n1378\n01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,845\nAll right some of the other ones that\nwe've got, let's stick with the archivers.\n\n1379\n01:08:42,845 --> 01:08:44,850\n7-Zip, this guy right here.\n\n1380\n01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,544\n.7Z, all right?\n\n1381\n01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:51,503\n7-Zip is a proprietary archiving\nformat and it does archiving and\n\n1382\n01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:56,180\ncompression and it was also\ndesigned to be a competitor to ZIP.\n\n1383\n01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,430\nFor the longest time RAR was\nkinda the leader on that,\n\n1384\n01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,615\nthey did better compression.\n\n1385\n01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:03,610\n7-Zip goes a step further right?\n\n1386\n01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:07,990\nSo 7-Zip is focused purely on getting\nthe best compression possible.\n\n1387\n01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,110\nAnd very few operating systems,\n\n1388\n01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:13,650\nI can't think of any off hand that\nhave native support for 7-Zip.\n\n1389\n01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,500\nSo you almost always need third party\nsoftware to be able to open that.\n\n1390\n01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,400\nAnd the 7-Zip people\nhave a freely available\n\n1391\n01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,940\narchiver that you can download and use,\nbut third party software will do it too.\n\n1392\n01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,280\nLike, I can use Entropy\nhere to fire that up.\n\n1393\n01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,220\nAnd I can see the 7-Zip file.\n\n1394\n01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,170\nAnd notice this one got it\ndown to 929.5 K in size.\n\n1395\n01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,887\nThat's the smallest of all\nthe formats that I made.\n\n1396\n01:09:34,887 --> 01:09:36,860\n7-Zip gave me the best result.\n\n1397\n01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,090\nSo if I want the absolute\nbest compression.\n\n1398\n01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:45,415\nI need to go with 7-Zip, but if I want\ncompatibility with most people's systems,\n\n1399\n01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:49,916\n7-Zip is the worst choice,\nbecause no one has native support for it.\n\n1400\n01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:55,146\nAll right the only other one that I have\nthat actually does compression Is JAR,\n\n1401\n01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:55,829\nJ-A-R.\n\n1402\n01:09:55,829 --> 01:10:00,350\nAnd JAR is not one that an average\nend user is going to make use of.\n\n1403\n01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:05,360\nThis is the Java archive format and it's\nsomething that a developer is gonna use.\n\n1404\n01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,070\nIf you're writing a Java application,\n\n1405\n01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:10,000\nJava is a programming\nlanguage developed by Oracle.\n\n1406\n01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,330\nAnd when they do that,\n\n1407\n01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:13,890\nthey create that application,\nthey can archive it to shrink it.\n\n1408\n01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,680\nAnd it's still executable.\n\n1409\n01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,860\nYou can actually run your\nprogram from inside of there.\n\n1410\n01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:21,760\nSo when you see a JAR file,\nit's normally a program you can run.\n\n1411\n01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,340\nAnd it is compressed, but\nthe program is in there and can run.\n\n1412\n01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:28,180\nSo it, it's, it's actually using\nsome of the ZIP library, so\n\n1413\n01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,610\nit's very similar to ZIP,\nbut just used with Java.\n\n1414\n01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:34,990\nI went ahead and archived War and\nPeace just to do it and\n\n1415\n01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,530\nnotice how it's the exact same\nsize as the ZIP down here.\n\n1416\n01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,660\nAnd it's cuz you're using\nthe same libraries.\n\n1417\n01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,300\nThe big difference between them\nis this one could be executable.\n\n1418\n01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,000\nThere could be a program\nin there that could run so\n\n1419\n01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,848\nyou have to be a little extra\ncareful with JARs, right?\n\n1420\n01:10:46,848 --> 01:10:50,460\nWhen you double-click on them\nyou might not be extracting them\n\n1421\n01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:51,250\nyou might be running them.\n\n1422\n01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,200\nAnd if it's got malicious software you\ncould get yourself in trouble, right?\n\n1423\n01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,500\nSo we gotta be careful with that.\n\n1424\n01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,510\nAll right there's a few others\nthat CompTIA is doing here that\n\n1425\n01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:04,790\nin my opinion really aren't\ncompression utilities.\n\n1426\n01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,490\nBut there are different\nways to store data,\n\n1427\n01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,640\nthey're more like archives, all right?\n\n1428\n01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,640\nAnd they're used for different purposes,\nso let, let's try and\n\n1429\n01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,640\ntackle each of these.\n\n1430\n01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,952\nThe first one is the ISO.\n\n1431\n01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:14,980\nAll right?\n\n1432\n01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:23,530\nAn ISO file, right here, what that is is a\ndigital image of a CD or a DVD all right?\n\n1433\n01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,950\nIf you have a CD-ROM disc\nthat has files on it or\n\n1434\n01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:31,570\na DVD that has files on it and you don't\nwant to rely on that disc you want to\n\n1435\n01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,280\nmake a back up of it,\nyou can create an ISO file.\n\n1436\n01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,470\nAnd an ISO file, it's named ISO because\nthere's a standards organization,\n\n1437\n01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,520\nThe International Organization\nof Standardization.\n\n1438\n01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,300\nThe name's in French, though,\nso it's actually ISO.\n\n1439\n01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,170\nAnd the ISO has a standard,\nISO 9660 if I remember right,\n\n1440\n01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,560\nthat defines the way that\nyou store files on a CD.\n\n1441\n01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,120\nAnd so\nwhen they started creating these images,\n\n1442\n01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,970\nthey just called it .iso,\nwe follow the ISO standard.\n\n1443\n01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:00,001\nAnd, and, that's basically it.\n\n1444\n01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:02,917\nSo, you see this as an image of a CD.\n\n1445\n01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:05,792\nIf I wanted to combine multiple\nfiles to send to somebody.\n\n1446\n01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,583\nI wouldn't use the ISO format, right?\n\n1447\n01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,000\nI just use one of the other ones.\n\n1448\n01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,942\nBut if I was backing up a disc,\nor if i was about to make a CD,\n\n1449\n01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:16,644\nthen I might make an ISO file and\nthen burn that to disc or\n\n1450\n01:12:16,644 --> 01:12:21,417\nvice versa, make an ISO file out of\na disc to have that back up, right?\n\n1451\n01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:23,781\nSo if you go out and\nyou buy a copy of windows, or\n\n1452\n01:12:23,781 --> 01:12:27,375\nyou buy a copy of Microsoft office or\nsomething, you get those discs.\n\n1453\n01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:30,858\nAnd you want to be sure you don't lose\nthem, or if they get scratched you still\n\n1454\n01:12:30,858 --> 01:12:33,460\nhave them, you can make an ISO\nimage of them, all right?\n\n1455\n01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:38,960\nBut it is basically a CD, and if you take\na look at the way they're handled, you'll\n\n1456\n01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,760\nsee that I can open them with some of\nthe various utilities here on my system.\n\n1457\n01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,320\nOne of them is the Disk Image mounter, and\n\n1458\n01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,690\nwhen I run that, what's gonna happen\nis that my, my MAC, is gonna see that,\n\n1459\n01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,930\nthere's the War and\nPeace file that's inside of it.\n\n1460\n01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:56,240\nBut it's actually seeing it,\nas a CD-ROM drive.\n\n1461\n01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:01,380\nIf I go into my computer here,\nand I look, here's that image.\n\n1462\n01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,030\nThat ISO file mounted right here.\n\n1463\n01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,820\nAnd the little picture is trying to\nshow me basically like, a CD drive.\n\n1464\n01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,550\nSo it thinks that I've popped\nthe CD in this virtual drive, and\n\n1465\n01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,810\nthere's the files that are on it,\nall right?\n\n1466\n01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:15,450\nAnd I can fire that up and\nthere will be my war and peace which,\n\n1467\n01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,300\nlet me open it with something\nother than sublime text.\n\n1468\n01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,060\nI'll open it up with text edit.\n\n1469\n01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:20,610\nThere it is.\nSo\n\n1470\n01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,620\nthere's my worm piece\nright off of that image.\n\n1471\n01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,530\nAll right, now,\nISO's are supported everywhere.\n\n1472\n01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,240\nI did it here on Mac,\nWindows has made a support for it,\n\n1473\n01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,610\nLinux has made a support for it,\nso ISO's are supported everywhere.\n\n1474\n01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:38,530\nBut in typical Apple tradition, they,\nthey don't leave well enough alone and so\n\n1475\n01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,030\nthey had to have their own format.\n\n1476\n01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,798\nAnd so they created a different\nformat called a DMG.\n\n1477\n01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:47,190\nAnd BMG, it just stands for\nthe Apple disk image,\n\n1478\n01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,495\nit's their own little format that\nthey use for backing up disks.\n\n1479\n01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:53,015\nAnd you can back up disks with it,\nor you can create your own.\n\n1480\n01:13:53,015 --> 01:13:56,420\nThere's a difference between this and\nthe ISO standard though.\n\n1481\n01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:01,180\nWhen you make an ISO, it'll only be as big\nas the data that's inside of it, right?\n\n1482\n01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:05,280\nSo, the ISO I made is only 3.3\nmegs because that's how big\n\n1483\n01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,610\nmy text file is that I threw in there.\n\n1484\n01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:09,320\nIf I put more files on there,\nit'll grow bigger, right?\n\n1485\n01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,960\nBut a DMG, it works more like a it's\nalmost like a USB key, right?\n\n1486\n01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,400\nSo, you have a certain\nsize available on the key,\n\n1487\n01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,240\nand then you can throw data\non it until you fill it up.\n\n1488\n01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:24,650\nSo, when I made a DMG, I just went with\nthe default, and the default is 100 megs.\n\n1489\n01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:28,985\nSo, it's 100 megabytes, and\nI threw War and Peace in there,\n\n1490\n01:14:28,985 --> 01:14:33,215\nbut even though it's only 3.3 megs, the\nfile is still 100 megs, cuz that's how big\n\n1491\n01:14:33,215 --> 01:14:37,305\nI made the DMG and if I double click\non that, you'll see my system mounted,\n\n1492\n01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:40,715\nactually it just appears over here, but\neven on the left side, there it is.\n\n1493\n01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:42,715\nIt shows as a new drive, so\n\n1494\n01:14:42,715 --> 01:14:48,160\nit looks like a CD drive, and\nthere's my text file right there, right?\n\n1495\n01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,170\nDMGs, are really just used on Macs.\n\n1496\n01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,700\nThere's third party software that'll\nlet you mount them on Windows or Linux,\n\n1497\n01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,410\nbut there's not really a lot\nof purpose in doing that,\n\n1498\n01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:59,840\nbecause usually a DMG is gonna\ncontain installation software.\n\n1499\n01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,030\nRight?\n\n1500\n01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,910\nWhen I installed Mavericks on this system,\nright at OS 10.9.\n\n1501\n01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,220\nWhen I installed that, I actually went and\n\n1502\n01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:12,390\ndownloaded the the installation file for\nit, which is right here, all right?\n\n1503\n01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:16,430\nThere's that installation file and the\ninstallation file, if I look at it wow,\n\n1504\n01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,550\nshoot, it says app.\n\n1505\n01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,270\nIf I dive inside of it,\nthere's actually a DMG in there,\n\n1506\n01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,645\nwhich is the disc image for maverick.\n\n1507\n01:15:22,645 --> 01:15:25,795\nAnd, you'll see some of the other\napplications do that too.\n\n1508\n01:15:25,795 --> 01:15:28,645\nThose dmg files are how\nwe distribute installers.\n\n1509\n01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:31,765\nYou know, I probably have\nan installer here somewhere\n\n1510\n01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:33,635\nlike I downloaded filezilla.\n\n1511\n01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:34,522\nI don't know if it was a zip.\n\n1512\n01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:38,972\nLet me here gant project,\nthat's a project management software so\n\n1513\n01:15:38,972 --> 01:15:43,552\nif I wanna install that on my computer\nI double click the DMG and my computer\n\n1514\n01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:47,770\nmounts it as a drive and now I can get\nat the file.So there's gant project.\n\n1515\n01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,600\nAnd if I want to install it,\nI just drag that and\n\n1516\n01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,020\ndrop it in my Applications folder.\n\n1517\n01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,630\nNow, it's installed.\n\n1518\n01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,640\nAll right.\n\n1519\n01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,960\nSo, it makes things easier on a Mac,\nand so,\n\n1520\n01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,690\nyou may see that format\nout there you might not.\n\n1521\n01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,570\nYou know, if you're just working\nin a Windows or LinuxWorld, you,\n\n1522\n01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,940\nyou're not gonna see\nthat format very much.\n\n1523\n01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,790\nBut those are all different\narchive formats, all right?\n\n1524\n01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:07,760\nNow, that's a lot.\n\n1525\n01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,050\nThere's more of these formats than any\nother file formats that called out.\n\n1526\n01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:14,900\nSo on the exam,\nhere's what you need to remember,\n\n1527\n01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,670\nyou need to remember which ones\ncompress and which ones don't.\n\n1528\n01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,800\nThey all do archiving to some extent.\n\n1529\n01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,430\nThey let you combine multiple\nfiles into one file, but\n\n1530\n01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:29,180\nthey don't all compress, and you also\nneed to remember which ones are popular.\n\n1531\n01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,610\nSo just to kind of summarize it, DMG and\n\n1532\n01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:36,750\nISO, those were for\nmaking disc images, right?\n\n1533\n01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,000\nImaging a CD and distributing software.\n\n1534\n01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,700\nThat's what those are for.\n\n1535\n01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,920\nAll right?\n\n1536\n01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,780\nJar, is for doing Java applications and\ndistributing those.\n\n1537\n01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,900\nThey're very specialized use.\n\n1538\n01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,809\nThe other ones are all generalized.\n\n1539\n01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:54,030\n7-Zip, G-Zip, RAR, and Zip.\n\n1540\n01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:56,600\nThose all compress, all right?\n\n1541\n01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,096\nThey compress your data to make it\nsmaller as well archiving it together,\n\n1542\n01:17:00,096 --> 01:17:04,150\nversus TAR that doesn't.\n\n1543\n01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:09,080\nTar just archives, doesn't make\nyour data any smaller, all right?\n\n1544\n01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,360\nAnd then lastly, Zip is the most popular.\n\n1545\n01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,600\nIt's gonna get you the best compatibility.\n\n1546\n01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,980\nIt gets pretty good compression rates,\nright?\n\n1547\n01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:21,850\nIt's not the greatest, but it's, it's good\nenough and it, it's supported darn near\n\n1548\n01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,680\nevery where, so that's gonna be the main\none that you put to use, all right?\n\n1549\n01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,090\nBut if you see an exam question that says,\n\n1550\n01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:31,680\nyou got some data that you want to\noccupy less space on the hard drive,\n\n1551\n01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,270\nwhich of the following formats would\nachieve that, and you see a selection.\n\n1552\n01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,660\nYou need to be able to identify\nwhich ones compress and\n\n1553\n01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:40,010\nwhich ones don't,\nwhich ones meet your needs.\n\n1554\n01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,360\nAll right, so\nthose are our compression formats.\n\n1555\n01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,310\nI know it's a lot to handle, so you,\n\n1556\n01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,520\nyou know might wanna review\nthis a few Few times.\n\n1557\n01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,830\nAnd we'll post our show notes.\n\n1558\n01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,630\nYou know, Ronnie and\nI have our little, like,\n\n1559\n01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:52,970\nour little cheat sheet off to the side.\n\n1560\n01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,250\nSo we don't forget which ones are,\nare in which category.\n\n1561\n01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,010\nBut we'll,\nwe'll post this with the episode, too.\n\n1562\n01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,540\nSo you'll have it kinda written out.\n\n1563\n01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,292\nDefinitely something to\nreview before the exam.\n\n1564\n01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:04,930\nAll right, all right Rickie, think of\nanything that we need to add to that?\n\n1565\n01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:05,830\nThat was quite a bit.\n\n1566\n01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:10,190\n>> No there's I didn't even know there\nwere that many file formats to tell you\n\n1567\n01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,090\nthe truth.\n\n1568\n01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,632\nThere's a far cry more.\n\n1569\n01:18:14,632 --> 01:18:17,010\n>> All right, well, I think we've\nblown everybody's minds enough,\n\n1570\n01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:19,740\nthis is probably a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up the show so let's\n\n1571\n01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,820\n>> Let's do that.\n\n1572\n01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,570\nLet me remind you guys that if\nyou

00:00:39,081\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,851\nI'm your host Don Pezet and\nback to you, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,660\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,720\n>> It is going well.\n\n7\n00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,400\nReady for another exciting episode\ninto the realm of IT fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,918\nSo we are getting ready to\ntackle some operating system and\n\n9\n00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,600\nsoftware best practices.\n\n10\n00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200\n>> Yeah, so objective 1.3,\nthat's what we're jumping into,\n\n11\n00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,040\nthe the full one is given a scenario,\nuse software management best practices.\n\n12\n00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,580\nAnd what we're really talking about\nhere are some of the standard\n\n13\n00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,690\nthings we need to remember when it comes\nto adding software to our computer and\n\n14\n00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,070\nremoving software from our computer.\n\n15\n00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,340\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that people\nkinda lose sight of when we do this.\n\n16\n00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,440\nSo, it's important to make sure that you\nfollow some standard best practices,\n\n17\n00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,135\nand that's what we're\ngonna take a look at.\n\n18\n00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:25,169\nSo, let's go with the very beginning,\nwhich is just installing software.\n\n19\n00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,330\nIf we want to get software installed onto\nour machine, it means that we want to\n\n20\n00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,410\nget our computer to do something that\nthe base operating system won't do.\n\n21\n00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,960\nSo, when you got a Windows machine,\nor a Mac OS machine, or\n\n22\n00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,378\na whatever, it can do a lot of\nstuff with just what's included.\n\n23\n00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:43,870\nBut there's times when you need\nsomething that's different,\n\n24\n00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,080\nsomething that's beyond\nwhat's build into it.\n\n25\n00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,150\nAnd so, you've got to go in and\ninstall software.\n\n26\n00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,540\nNow where do we get that software from?\n\n27\n00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,260\n>> There's multiple ways that we\ncan get software on our computer.\n\n28\n00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,870\nA lot of times today most\nof us will go out there and\n\n29\n00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,370\ndownload the software that we want.\n\n30\n00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,630\nAnd a lot of times you'll actually\njust purchase it right online.\n\n31\n00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,470\nYou'll download the software and\nthey'll also send you what we normally\n\n32\n00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,580\ncall a product key, or some type of\nlicensing that you'll also have to have.\n\n33\n00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,130\nSo that's usually the way\nwe see it most often today.\n\n34\n00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,770\nBut it used to be, where well Don and\nI might have to head out to one\n\n35\n00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,590\nof those brick and mortar stores like Best\nBuy or, or some other location like that,\n\n36\n00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,530\nRadioShack or, or\nwhoever was selling software.\n\n37\n00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,300\nAnd then you'd purchase it'd and come in\nthis nice big box that would have one disc\n\n38\n00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,550\nin it, and you'd go ahead and\ninstall it from the media there, too.\n\n39\n00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,530\n>> And now one of the challenges we\nhave with our modern model which is you\n\n40\n00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,490\ngo out to a company's website,\nyou find the software and you install it.\n\n41\n00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,959\nIs that, this might be new software\nthat you just found that you don't know\n\n42\n00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,577\na lot about.\n\n43\n00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:49,072\nAnd when you go to that website, how do\nyou know that it's a trustworthy source?\n\n44\n00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:50,980\nAnd that's a real challenge.\n\n45\n00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,840\nBecause when you do a search for\nthings out on Google or wherever.\n\n46\n00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,140\nIf you come up with an idea for some kinda\nsoftware that you need, and you go and\n\n47\n00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,440\ndo a search.\n\n48\n00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,050\nYou get search results, but how do you\nknow which companies are reputable and\n\n49\n00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,730\nwhich ones aren't?\n\n50\n00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,451\nAnd there are sites that kinda prey\non this specifically, sites like,\n\n51\n00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,460\nwhat's the one that always comes in?\n\n52\n00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,670\nSoftonic, or something.\n\n53\n00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> Here, let's do an example.\n\n54\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560\nHere, I'm gonna,\nI'm gonna fire up a web browser, and,\n\n55\n00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,540\nlet's say that I need software that can\n\n56\n00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,280\nmaybe I've got a bunch of audio files,\nand I want to convert wav files into mp3.\n\n57\n00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,716\nSo I want some software that can do that,\nso\n\n58\n00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,141\nI might do a search that\nsays convert wav to mp3.\n\n59\n00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,372\nAnd I'm going to start\ngetting some responses back,\n\n60\n00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,140\nand the very first one here is medio.io.\n\n61\n00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,095\nThey've got an online audio converter.\n\n62\n00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,689\nWe got audioformat.com.\n\n63\n00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:44,730\nI've never heard of any of these\ncompanies, zamzar.com, and so on.\n\n64\n00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,410\nNow, those might be perfectly\nlegitimate companies.\n\n65\n00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,300\nI dunno.\n\n66\n00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,787\nYou might go to those companies though and\nthey might not be on the up and up.\n\n67\n00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:56,150\nAnd when you install that software\nit might be carrying a lot of other\n\n68\n00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,260\nthings with it.\n\n69\n00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,540\nWe call that, not necessarily malware,\nbut normally spyware or adware.\n\n70\n00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,240\nWhere it'll add a toolbar\nto your web browser,\n\n71\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,210\ndisplay advertisements on your computer.\n\n72\n00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,360\nAny time you see free software\non the internet you need to be\n\n73\n00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,020\ncareful about that.\n\n74\n00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,577\nBecause often it's going to\nlead to that kinda thing.\n\n75\n00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:16,550\nThat you will get advertisements and\nstuff.\n\n76\n00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,340\nThere's also companies like CNET,\nwhich aggregates software.\n\n77\n00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,010\nSo, the software might be\nwritten by a developer and\n\n78\n00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,961\nit might be hosted on their site even.\n\n79\n00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,957\nBut it's also copied over to CNET.\n\n80\n00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,133\nAnd the problem with sites like that is,\n\n81\n00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,360\nfirst off, you don't know if it's\nthe newest version of the software or not.\n\n82\n00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,420\nIt might be outdated from what\nthe vendor is actually deploying.\n\n83\n00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,060\nAnd secondly,\na lot of these file aggregation sites\n\n84\n00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,400\nadd stuff to the software to pay for\nthe bandwidth that they use.\n\n85\n00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,410\nAnd so, you're not necessarily\ngetting a clean download.\n\n86\n00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,020\nSo rule number one for\n\n87\n00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,310\ninstalling software is you need to\nget it from a trustworthy source.\n\n88\n00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,170\nIf this is the first time you've heard\nof that web page don't just download and\n\n89\n00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,360\ninstall whatever they offer you.\n\n90\n00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,354\nYou don't know what's gonna happen.\n\n91\n00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,524\nAnd beware.\n\n92\n00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,703\nAny time you deal with sites like CNET,\n\n93\n00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:11,490\nSourceForge there's another one I'm sure\nit'll be here in the top links somewhere.\n\n94\n00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,750\nThere's one,\nit's called like Softonic, and\n\n95\n00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,215\nthere's one that's like\nSoftware Encyclopedia or something.\n\n96\n00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:21,965\nAnd I always come across them\nwhen I search for programs.\n\n97\n00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,895\nAnd of course you know now\nthat I do it live on the show,\n\n98\n00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,693\nI'm not gonna get a single result on em.\n\n99\n00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,475\n>> Softonic sounds right, though.\n\n100\n00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,095\n>> Yeah it's oh there\n>> There it is.\n\n101\n00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,570\n>> Softonic that is one of them.\n\n102\n00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,580\nAnd so here,\nI'm starting to get these links, and\n\n103\n00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,150\nsee how it's; full version, free software.\n\n104\n00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,210\nI'm like; wow, it's free and\nyou get the whole thing.\n\n105\n00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,010\nWell, that's great, but they've normally\nmodified it to add stuff onto it.\n\n106\n00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,160\nSo, you have to be careful with those.\n\n107\n00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,720\nAlways get your software\nfrom a trustworthy source.\n\n108\n00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,170\nThat's rule number one.\n\n109\n00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,920\nIf you bought the software and\nthey sent you a CD, then it's pretty safe.\n\n110\n00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,360\nIf you're downloading it from a website\nmake sure you're getting it from that\n\n111\n00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,870\noriginal vendor.\n\n112\n00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,860\nAnd it pains me to say sites\nlike SourceForge, cuz for\n\n113\n00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,820\nthe longest time SourceForge used to be\nlike the safe place to go and get stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,956\nBut they've really been doing\nsome bad things the last year.\n\n115\n00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:10,810\nSo even some of the trustworthy sites\nbecome untrustworthy over time.\n\n116\n00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,230\nWe have got to watch out.\n\n117\n00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,240\n>> And there's a lot of us that\nsit there and go; look, its free.\n\n118\n00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,120\nWe'll deal with some of this stuff that\nthey end up putting on the computers.\n\n119\n00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,970\nBut the problem is,\nwe tend to click through the install so\n\n120\n00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,780\nfast we don't see what they add in in\nthe installer that they've put in.\n\n121\n00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,230\nAnd so, all of a sudden, you have more\nthan you realize on a computer, and\n\n122\n00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,150\nit takes a lot longer for\nyou to figure out what they've done.\n\n123\n00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,910\nRather than for\nyou to build a used product.\n\n124\n00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,560\nAnd that's where the work\nbecomes a little bit more,\n\n125\n00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,980\non the side in which you're like,\nare you joking,\n\n126\n00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,790\nhave to do all this everything I launch\nthe program, before I can use it?\n\n127\n00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,560\nYes, you do.\n\n128\n00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,172\n>> Yeah, and some of the vendors\nare trying to fix this,\n\n129\n00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,855\nsome of the operating systems\nby offering app stores.\n\n130\n00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:52,690\nSo for example if you’re on Mac OS you\ncan fire up the Mac OS App Store and\n\n131\n00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,830\nyou can view a curated list that Apple\nhas gone through and cleaned up.\n\n132\n00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,180\nTo make sure that there is no\nmalicious software in there or\n\n133\n00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,640\nsoftware that is doing\nthings it shouldn’t.\n\n134\n00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,010\nSo that’s good in a way, you've got\nthis kinda safe zone that you can go and\n\n135\n00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,240\nget software from.\n\n136\n00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,490\nBut it’s bad in a way in that not every\ndeveloper lists their software there.\n\n137\n00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,820\nSo you might want something\nlike Adobe Photoshop and,\n\n138\n00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,950\nit's not in the Mac OS App Store.\n\n139\n00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,510\nSo you have to go and\nget that from Adobe directly.\n\n140\n00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,600\nMicrosoft's doing the same\nthing with the Windows,\n\n141\n00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,370\nthey don't call it the Windows app store,\nit's just the Windows store.\n\n142\n00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,840\nAnd you can go in, and\npurchase apps there.\n\n143\n00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,330\nBut again,\nnot every developer is listed in there, so\n\n144\n00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,180\nthe stores aren't quite where\nthey need to be just yet.\n\n145\n00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,590\nIn the future we'll see that change.\n\n146\n00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,880\nNow when you go and\ndownload a file to install.\n\n147\n00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,250\nYou're installing that operating system,\n\n148\n00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,890\nand if we're getting it from the orignal\nvendor, then it's usually pretty safe.\n\n149\n00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,060\nAs long as it's a vendor we trust,\nsomebody we've heard of,\n\n150\n00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,260\nnot somebody we just found\nrandomly on a Google search.\n\n151\n00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,250\nIf it's random,\nyou just need to do your research.\n\n152\n00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,573\nIs that a legitimate developer?\n\n153\n00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,733\nIs it somebody that other\npeople have worked with before?\n\n154\n00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,869\nIs it someone you can trust?\n\n155\n00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:57,589\nWhen it comes to doing the install\n>> There are some technologies there\n\n156\n00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:58,281\nthat can help.\n\n157\n00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:01,851\nA lot of vendors have started doing what's\ncalled digitally signed installers.\n\n158\n00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,738\nAnd that's where they have the installer\nfor their software, the file you download\n\n159\n00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,765\nto install and they've digitally\nsigned it with a certificate.\n\n160\n00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:14,715\nAnd the nice part about that is if\nanother company like SourceForge.\n\n161\n00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:19,430\nIf they tacking on their software on top\nof it, the certificate is no longer valid.\n\n162\n00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,054\nAnd so when you go to to install,\nyou'll get a warning about that.\n\n163\n00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:22,570\nRight?\n\n164\n00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,350\nSo now you have kind of\na visual queue that let's you\n\n165\n00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,873\nknow that this software is no longer safe,\nbut\n\n166\n00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:31,636\nthe problem with the digital signing\npiece is not everybody does it.\n\n167\n00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,692\nEverything they update their software,\nthey need to resign it with that\n\n168\n00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,113\ncertificate and some vendors do,\nsome vendors don't.\n\n169\n00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,516\nSo you can't always rely on that.\n\n170\n00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:41,478\nThat really makes things\nchallenging to it.\n\n171\n00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,073\nAll right.\n\n172\n00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,553\nSo when we go to download and install,\n\n173\n00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:48,025\nthe installation process itself\nis pretty straightforward.\n\n174\n00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,276\nIt is different though on\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n175\n00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:55,308\nSo we wanna show you some examples on\na Windows machine, as well as on a Mac.\n\n176\n00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:56,637\nYou wanna go first?\n\n177\n00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,588\n>> Sure.\n>> You wanna start with Windows?\n\n178\n00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,925\n>> Yeah, so I've got a Windows 7\nmachine launched up and ready to go.\n\n179\n00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:06,768\nAnd I went ahead and downloaded my source\ninformation from Filezilla itself,\n\n180\n00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,524\nso I have this 32-bit setup file.\n\n181\n00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:13,673\nAnd normally, once you get that onto the\ncomputer, all you have to do is actually,\n\n182\n00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:17,422\nsometimes depending on the clicks,\nI normally have to double-click it.\n\n183\n00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:22,633\nAnd here in Windows 7, it gets me\nthe user account control that asked me,\n\n184\n00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,757\nhey, are you sure you\nwant to install this?\n\n185\n00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:28,299\nIf you're not sure about it,\nyou always say no, but yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,842\n>> And see how it's saying right\nthere an unknown publisher?\n\n187\n00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,279\nThat's telling us that this\nis not digitally signed.\n\n188\n00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,095\nThere's not certificate attached to it, so\n\n189\n00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,017\nwe can't really verify\nout where it came from.\n\n190\n00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:39,711\nWindows is saying, you need to verify.\n\n191\n00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,253\nDid you get this from a safe source?\n\n192\n00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,111\nIf not, say no and\nthen go to that vendor's site and get it.\n\n193\n00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:47,472\nIn this case, the FileZilla Guide,\nit's a free product.\n\n194\n00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,200\nAnd so they don't digitally sign it,\ncuz that cost money.\n\n195\n00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,318\nAnd so we know that we got it from a safe\nlocation and we can do the install.\n\n196\n00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:57,886\n>> And once we get here, of course,\n\n197\n00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,466\nwe have what we call the end\nuser licensing agreement.\n\n198\n00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,443\nThat you just have to be able to read and\nmake sure that you agree to this.\n\n199\n00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:07,889\nOf course, every single software\nvendor out there would love for\n\n200\n00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,788\nyou to read every word of this and\nunderstand every single thing about it.\n\n201\n00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:15,167\nMost of us probably just go ahead and\njust click Agree.\n\n202\n00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,523\n>> The funny part about them\nis they don't stand up court.\n\n203\n00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:18,023\nDid you know that?\n\n204\n00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:18,951\n>> No, I did not know that.\n\n205\n00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,139\n>> Yeah.\nBecause the big problem with these is\n\n206\n00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,449\nthere's no way to prove that you're\nthe person that clicked I Agree.\n\n207\n00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:26,460\n>> Right.\n>> It just knows that somebody clicked\n\n208\n00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,454\nit and so they don't hold up in court,\nbut every software does it.\n\n209\n00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,311\nThere's always an end\nuser license agreement.\n\n210\n00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,501\n>> Yeah.\nAnd sometimes,\n\n211\n00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,853\nthey're a little bit tricky.\n\n212\n00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:36,275\nSo you might even see the I Agree button,\nbut\n\n213\n00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:38,711\nit doesn't show up where it's grayed out.\n\n214\n00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:42,705\nAnd so what they require you to do on some\nof them is that you'll probably have to\n\n215\n00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:46,757\nscroll all the way down to the bottom and\nthen, you'll probably see, inside,\n\n216\n00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,479\nit says, I Agree or\nI have read the following or then,\n\n217\n00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,569\nthe actual button will then highlight.\n\n218\n00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,743\nMaking sure that you have at least seen\nit, even if you scrolled past it in a blur\n\n219\n00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,299\njust like I did that\nyou've at least done that.\n\n220\n00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,522\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and click I Agree.\n\n221\n00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:03,129\nAnd now notice I have two\ndifferent selections here.\n\n222\n00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,670\nIs it for everyone on the computer or\nis it only going to be for me?\n\n223\n00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,216\nSo this is also something, which we can\nrestrict the usage of this program or\n\n224\n00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:12,859\nwe can allow for everyone.\n\n225\n00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,980\n>> Yeah,\nif you're a single user of the computer,\n\n226\n00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,321\nit doesn't really matter\nwhich of those you choose.\n\n227\n00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:20,128\nBut if you share your computer,\nmaybe it's a family computer.\n\n228\n00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,648\nSo you've got the wife,\nthe kids or whatever,\n\n229\n00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,484\nyou might want the program\nto just be visible for you.\n\n230\n00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,984\nAnd if you choose that,\nthe other users won't even see it.\n\n231\n00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,158\nBut if it's something you're sharing,\n\n232\n00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,674\nyou want everybody to see\nyou would choose all users.\n\n233\n00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:32,302\n>> Yep.\nAnd\n\n234\n00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:35,836\nmost of them will actually tell you\nright now that at the beginning,\n\n235\n00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,308\ninstallation for all users\nrequires administrator privileges.\n\n236\n00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:43,271\nSo if you as a user are not going to have\nthe administrator privileges that means\n\n237\n00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:47,056\nthat you don't have the permissions to\nbe able to install this program, so\n\n238\n00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,359\nyou're probably not going to be\nable to go any further than this,\n\n239\n00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,067\neven if it gets you to this point.\n\n240\n00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:56,743\nSo normally if you're normal, if you're\nthe first account on this computer, in\n\n241\n00:11:56,743 --> 00:12:01,446\nother words, you installed this operating\nsystem and you created that account.\n\n242\n00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:06,085\nMore than likely,\nyou'll be able to install this right away.\n\n243\n00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:10,001\nI'm gonna click Next and then it has\ndifferent components that it can actually\n\n244\n00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,974\ngive us, if we want to install them in.\n\n245\n00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,807\nOr if we wanna minimal,\nwe can actually uncheck some of these.\n\n246\n00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:19,260\nSo if you hover over them, you'll see what\nthe descriptions are, additional icon\n\n247\n00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,027\nsets, language files, shell extension and\ndo I want a desktop icon?\n\n248\n00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:25,900\nI like a desktop icon, I can select that.\n\n249\n00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,682\n>> Yeah, some of the common items there.\n\n250\n00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,691\nThe desktop icon is one and\nI usually turn that off,\n\n251\n00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,484\nbecause I handle all\nthe icons on my desktop.\n\n252\n00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,620\nAnd sometimes,\nyou'll see Quick Launch bar.\n\n253\n00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,940\nQuick Launch bar only applies\nto Windows XP and earlier.\n\n254\n00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,771\nIn Windows Vista, there is a Quick Launch\nbar, but it's hidden by default.\n\n255\n00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:43,215\nIn Windows 7 and higher,\nthere is no quick launch bar anymore.\n\n256\n00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:47,675\nThat option still shows up almost\nalways and it gets ignored,\n\n257\n00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,518\nit just doesn't do anything anymore.\n\n258\n00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,957\n>> And then it's gonna ask you\nwhere you want to install this.\n\n259\n00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:55,543\nMost of us will probably\nleave this alone by default,\n\n260\n00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:58,997\nunless there's a special reason for\nyou to install it some place else.\n\n261\n00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:03,798\nSo usually, all of our programs\nin Windows are private install\n\n262\n00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,151\nwith either sub-protocol program files or\n\n263\n00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:11,334\nprogram files x 86 is what\nwe'll also end up taking.\n\n264\n00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:15,316\n>> And that just ties back to whether\nthe 32 bit software or 64 bit software.\n\n265\n00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,755\nIt's just a different directory\nWindows sort set out for you, so\n\n266\n00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,050\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n267\n00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,990\n>> And then of course, it tells you\nhow much space it's gonna take up,\n\n268\n00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,517\nmaking sure that you do have enough free\nspace to be able to install it from there.\n\n269\n00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:26,236\nClick Next.\n\n270\n00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:30,278\nAnd then it's gonna ask if I want\nto create any additional shortcuts,\n\n271\n00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:34,090\nI'm not gonna create any\nadditional shortcuts.\n\n272\n00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,000\nInstall and from there,\nwe'll see the installation happen.\n\n273\n00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,770\nAnd then at the end,\nit should normally tell you or\n\n274\n00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,960\nconfirm that everything\nwas done successfully.\n\n275\n00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,168\nAnd there is a little check mark\nto actually prove that it's done.\n\n276\n00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:49,529\n>> And once it's done,\nwe just finish and now we've got it.\n\n277\n00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,785\nAnd this one actually offered to run\nthe software after it was installed.\n\n278\n00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:56,448\nSo, once it runs,\nnow it's up and it's running.\n\n279\n00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,608\nRight?\nNow at this point,\n\n280\n00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:58,759\nthe software's installed.\n\n281\n00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,703\nYou could run it,\nyou can do whatever you need with it.\n\n282\n00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,677\nThat's the basic process, right?\n\n283\n00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:07,535\nWell, once you're done with the software,\nif you don't need it anymore.\n\n284\n00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:09,033\nMaybe you just need it temporarily,\nall right?\n\n285\n00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:13,920\nIt's best not to keep software\nlaying around that you're not using.\n\n286\n00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,466\nThe less software you have on your system,\n\n287\n00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,518\nthe less vulnerabilities\nyou expose yourself to.\n\n288\n00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,059\nRight?\nThe,\n\n289\n00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,187\nif you find a computer that's just packed\nfull of hundreds of different software\n\n290\n00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,953\nprograms, those are all different\nprograms that could have flaws in them\n\n291\n00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:31,067\nthat allow viruses and\nother exploits to infect a computer.\n\n292\n00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:37,121\nSo one of the best practices that we have\nis to keep our installation set small,\n\n293\n00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,166\ninstall as few programs as necessary.\n\n294\n00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,367\nAnd when you're done with the program, if\nyou don't need it anymore, uninstall it.\n\n295\n00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,975\nRemove it, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,990\nIf you're one of those people that says,\nwell, I want to save it in case,\n\n297\n00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,618\nI need it again later.\n\n298\n00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,957\nWell, you can save the installation file.\n\n299\n00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,566\nBut you don't actually need\nto have it installed and\n\n300\n00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,590\nthe reason is a lot of programs,\nthey don't just install and\n\n301\n00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,230\nthen that's the end of it, if you\ndon't run it they don't do anything.\n\n302\n00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,945\nA lot of programs will set themselves\nto start when your computer boots.\n\n303\n00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,387\nThey'll create services in\nthe background where they're running and\n\n304\n00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:11,516\nconsuming memory and even though you're\nnot using them, they're still running and\n\n305\n00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,365\nconsuming resources on your system.\n\n306\n00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,994\nA great example would be\nsomething like iTunes.\n\n307\n00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,723\nIf you install the iTunes Music Library,\nyou might use that when you're\n\n308\n00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:22,366\nsynchronizing to your iPhone or\niPod or whatever.\n\n309\n00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:22,999\nRight?\n\n310\n00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,532\nBut what about when\nyou're not synchronizing?\n\n311\n00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:27,116\nITunes is still running in the background,\nit's what it does.\n\n312\n00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:28,591\nIt's indexing your music and\n\n313\n00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:32,076\nthey wanted to make sure it runs as\nfast as possible when you ask for it.\n\n314\n00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:33,952\nWhen you click on that icon,\nthat it's already running.\n\n315\n00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,762\nThey want their software to run better.\n\n316\n00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:40,154\nMeanwhile, they're taking away resources\nfrom other programs that you actually\n\n317\n00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:40,787\nare using.\n\n318\n00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,701\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou at least disable, but\n\n319\n00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,094\neven better remove software\nthat you're not making use of.\n\n320\n00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:47,727\nRight?\n\n321\n00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,991\nSo Ronnie, let's take a look\nat the uninstall process.\n\n322\n00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,635\n>> Sure.\n\n323\n00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,516\nYeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent uninstall processes that\n\n324\n00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:54,379\nwe can go through.\n\n325\n00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,208\nThe older way of doing this\nin Windows is that not every\n\n326\n00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,857\nprogram had it's own uninstaller.\n\n327\n00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,965\nSo if you go to the Start button and\nAll Programs and\n\n328\n00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,483\nI'm gonna look up this Filezilla here.\n\n329\n00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,370\nOh, I forgot, I didn't create one, did I?\n\n330\n00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,406\nI didn't actually create it,\nso it's not gonna be there.\n\n331\n00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:14,010\nA lot of times inside of it's\nown subfolder if it created it.\n\n332\n00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,621\nI didn't allow it to create\nany additional shortcuts.\n\n333\n00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:20,466\nNotice there, you might find that it has\nits own uninstaller and if it does they\n\n334\n00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:24,721\nrecommend, at least those software product\nrecommend that you use that uninstall and\n\n335\n00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:27,576\nthat removes it completely\nfrom the operating system, so\n\n336\n00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:31,890\nthat you don't have any traces of it\nleft over on the operating system.\n\n337\n00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,657\nBut if you happen to not have\nthe uninstaller available like mine,\n\n338\n00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:38,557\ndoesn't seem to have\nthe uninstaller available.\n\n339\n00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:43,491\nI can go to Control Panel and in Control\nPanel, I have this program flank and\n\n340\n00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:48,113\nnotice directly underneath it where\nit says, uninstall a program and\n\n341\n00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,800\nthen I can select it from there.\n\n342\n00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,730\nOnce I select that program, that\nFilezilla Client, notice that above it,\n\n343\n00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,811\nI have that uninstall link and\nI can select it and\n\n344\n00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:03,532\nit brings up the uninstall client\nitself to actually begin to run again.\n\n345\n00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:06,354\nAnd then I simply select, Uninstall and\n\n346\n00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:11,085\nnotice that the desk top icon now\nhas disappeared and it verifies for\n\n347\n00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:16,314\nme that it's been uninstalled from\nthe computer and then I click Finish and\n\n348\n00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:19,971\nthat should successfully\nremove that one program.\n\n349\n00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,214\n>> And now the dedicated uninstall\nthat you talked about first,\n\n350\n00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:25,530\nthat's actually old way for doing things.\n\n351\n00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,058\nIt used to be that every program\nhad their own uninstaller, so\n\n352\n00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,453\nyou'd have to go into your start menu and\nfind it that way.\n\n353\n00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:34,316\nBut for years, Microsoft has been pushing\npeople to no longer use the dedicated\n\n354\n00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:38,239\nuninstaller, but instead be listed under\nthat Add/Remove Programs screen and\n\n355\n00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,120\nthat's where they want it now.\n\n356\n00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,086\nSo it's very common for newer applications\nto not have the dedicated installer,\n\n357\n00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,243\nlike you saw, Ronnie.\n\n358\n00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:47,360\nAnd then it'll just be listed\nunder the Control Panel.\n\n359\n00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,083\nAnd the reason they did that was their\nwhole plan with Windows 8, where they were\n\n360\n00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,865\nditching the start menu and making it\nwhere you couldn't find those uninstallers\n\n361\n00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,235\nand so they want you to make it,\nwhere it's all concise and in one place.\n\n362\n00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:01,220\nSo we do see changes over time, right?\n\n363\n00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,518\nNew technologies come out and\nthings start to behave differently.\n\n364\n00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,860\nSo just keep that in mind as\nyou work with the system.\n\n365\n00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,065\nNow, as far as uninstalling.\n\n366\n00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:15,292\nOnce you remove it, it in theory\nremoves all of the setting, but\n\n367\n00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,423\nit can leave some files behind.\n\n368\n00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:18,910\nThat's not uncommon.\n\n369\n00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,203\nUsually, it's very small stuff or it\nleaves the configuration for the software.\n\n370\n00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:27,387\nSo it might have removed all the software\nfiles themselves, but the configuration,\n\n371\n00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:31,660\nlittle text config files are still\nsitting there or entries in the registry.\n\n372\n00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,240\nIn Windows, when you install software,\n\n373\n00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,530\nit actually creates entries\nin more than one place.\n\n374\n00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,911\nThere's the software files, that are\nusually put in the program files directory\n\n375\n00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,175\nthat Ronnie showed and\nsome of them go in the registry.\n\n376\n00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:44,918\nAnd the registry is this configuration\narea that Windows stores in a different\n\n377\n00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,978\nlocation and when you want to\ninstall software, a lot of times,\n\n378\n00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:49,870\nthe registry values will stay behind.\n\n379\n00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,268\nIt's not such a gig deal, because they're\nnot being used while the software is gone.\n\n380\n00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:57,360\nBut if you reinstall the software in the\nfuture, your old settings are still there.\n\n381\n00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,338\nIt preserves it.\n\n382\n00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,843\nSo you may see that from time to time,\nwhere you install software thinking it's\n\n383\n00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:05,160\nthe first time, but it was installed\nbefore and it retains your settings.\n\n384\n00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,255\nSo don't be shocked, if that happens.\n\n385\n00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,680\nIt doesn't mean that you\ndidn't uninstall the software.\n\n386\n00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,890\nIt just means that a little pieces were\nleft behind, so not a giant deal there.\n\n387\n00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440\nAll right.\nSo that's the installation and\n\n388\n00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,310\nuninstallation process there on a Windows\nmachine, pretty straightforward.\n\n389\n00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,528\nIt is a little bit different on a MAC and\nso\n\n390\n00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:27,670\nI'm downloading some software\nhere in the background.\n\n391\n00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,400\nOh, it's actually a bad example right\nthere cause they're doing a zip file.\n\n392\n00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,220\nWhen you download software for\n\n393\n00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,791\na Mac, there's a few different\nformats that it can come in.\n\n394\n00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,982\nThe most common format is a dmg file,\nwhich is a, a disk image and\n\n395\n00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,410\nwe can install from that.\n\n396\n00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,922\nAnother format that you may see is\njust a zip file, an archive and\n\n397\n00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,949\nit'll have the installation in it.\n\n398\n00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:52,494\nAnd so here, I was downloading\nthe Plex Home Theater for\n\n399\n00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:56,500\nMac and when I went to download it,\nthey just had that zip file.\n\n400\n00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,328\nThey don't actually have a dmg available.\n\n401\n00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:03,562\nAnd if that's the case, what you'll\nend up having to do is extract it,\n\n402\n00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:06,102\nI'm just gonna click on\nit to extract it and\n\n403\n00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:11,310\nthen there's the application file right\nthere extracted from the installer.\n\n404\n00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,001\nAnd you just take that program and\nyou drag it and\n\n405\n00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,681\ndrop it right into applications.\n\n406\n00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:22,260\nSo pretty easy to install software,\nit’s just drag and drop.\n\n407\n00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,368\nThat one came out of a zip file and\nso I had to extract it first and\n\n408\n00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:30,089\nthat’s not how most of your\ninstallers are going to go.\n\n409\n00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,540\nMost of your installers go\na little bit different.\n\n410\n00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,251\nLet me show you a different one here.\n\n411\n00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:37,820\nSo on my desktop,\nI’ve got Like yours Genymotion, right?\n\n412\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,618\nThis is a little Android emulator and\ndevelopment environment and\n\n413\n00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,596\nthey actually shipped it as a dmg.\n\n414\n00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:47,656\nAnd I downloaded this dmg file from their\nwebsite and when I double-click on it,\n\n415\n00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:49,540\nit's just going to mount it.\n\n416\n00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,554\nTerrifying, which I can actually skip,\nnow it's done and then it runs,.\n\n417\n00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:57,636\nI mean, you get a simple screen like this,\nwhich is saying, here's our programs,\n\n418\n00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,663\njust drag and drop them to applications.\n\n419\n00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:02,500\nThis is actually just a shortcut\nto my applications folder.\n\n420\n00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,816\nIf I double-click on that, I'm in my\napplications folder, took me right there.\n\n421\n00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:12,010\nSo when I drag this and drop it into\napplications, that's what's installing it.\n\n422\n00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,577\nAll right?\n\n423\n00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:17,270\nNow when Ronnie did his installation,\nit copied a ton of files.\n\n424\n00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,222\nWell, you do that with a Mac too.\n\n425\n00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,484\nThey're just all embedded in one big file,\nso\n\n426\n00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:24,964\nthis one file contains all the different\npieces this software needs and\n\n427\n00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,580\ndragging it and\ndropping it is enough to get it there.\n\n428\n00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,146\nSo when you do that,\nyou'll see a little copy operation appear.\n\n429\n00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,109\nThere's mine.\n\n430\n00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:34,793\nSo it's copying over and\nwhen it's done I've now got Genymotion and\n\n431\n00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,360\nit's installed.\n\n432\n00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,867\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,260\nSo pretty easy to install that.\n\n434\n00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,455\nIt did not prompt me to be\nan administrator to do that, right?\n\n435\n00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:47,661\nMacs have slightly different permissions\nthan Windows and so most software,\n\n436\n00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,310\na regular end user is able to\ninstall without being an admin.\n\n437\n00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,668\nYou can restrict that, but\nthe default is it doesn't.\n\n438\n00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:58,648\nBut there is some software that requires\nmodifications to the underlying OS and\n\n439\n00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:03,340\nanything that does that,\ndoes require administrative privileges.\n\n440\n00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,606\nSo if we install something a little\nheavier like Virtual Box here,\n\n441\n00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:08,486\nthat's a virtualization software.\n\n442\n00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:14,600\nWhen we got to install it, it will\nactually prompt to be administrator.\n\n443\n00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,650\nAnd so when we look, this one is\nshipping as a pkg, as a package.\n\n444\n00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,240\nAll right?\n\n445\n00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,276\nWhenever you see a package,\nthat's your first indicator that hey,\n\n446\n00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:27,010\nthis isn't just a regular program, this\nis something that's got to be installed.\n\n447\n00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,874\nAnd you'll need to be an administrator and\n\n448\n00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:32,070\nthis is where it starts to be a lot\nmore like what we saw on Windows.\n\n449\n00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,792\nIf I double-click on that pkg,\nit's gonna launch an installer.\n\n450\n00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:36,304\nRight?\n\n451\n00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,420\nAnd installer like what Ronnie showed.\n\n452\n00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,242\nSo here it's telling me that\nthis package is gonna be run and\n\n453\n00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:44,071\ndetermine if the software can\nbe installed and I Continue.\n\n454\n00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,102\nI've got a little wizard, right?\n\n455\n00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,833\nIt's telling me what I'm installing.\n\n456\n00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,311\nI can pick my destination,\nbut here it's skipping that,\n\n457\n00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,720\ncuz it knows I'm gonna go to applications,\nbut you can change the location.\n\n458\n00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,700\nSo I can click that and\nbrowse to a different place and\n\n459\n00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,987\nthen if we wanna customize it, we can\npick a few other options right there.\n\n460\n00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:03,335\nWhat I'm installing, just like we saw\nwith files delete, we can pick and\n\n461\n00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:05,549\nchoose the pieces and\nthen we can do the install.\n\n462\n00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:06,199\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,970\nAnd when we install,\nit's gonna throw it in and here it is.\n\n464\n00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,680\nI need to be an administrator, cuz this\none is modifying the underlying OS.\n\n465\n00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,403\nSo with the Macs,\n\n466\n00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:16,893\nthey actually differentiate between that\nwith the Windows machines, they don't.\n\n467\n00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:20,374\nThe Windows machines are a little bit more\nsecure in that respect in how they handle\n\n468\n00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:21,085\nthat software.\n\n469\n00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:22,221\nAll right?\n\n470\n00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:24,885\nOnce the software is installed and\nI don't actually need to install that,\n\n471\n00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,910\nI installed the other software.\n\n472\n00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,199\nOnce the software's installed,\nyou'll see it in your Applications folder.\n\n473\n00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:34,220\nSo for example,\nI installed Plex Home Theater right there.\n\n474\n00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,799\nAll right.\n\n475\n00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,738\nNow when you install software, if it's\nfrom the internet, the first time you\n\n476\n00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:43,260\ninstall it, the Mac is gonna look at that\nand say, oh, you're running a new app.\n\n477\n00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,112\nAnd this came from the internet,\nare you sure this is safe?\n\n478\n00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:49,203\nAnd I think I've run this one before,\nso it might not do it.\n\n479\n00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:51,015\nLet's see if it does it.\n\n480\n00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,345\nThere it is.\n\n481\n00:23:52,345 --> 00:23:55,578\nIf it's not digitally signed,\nif it has a certificate to it and\n\n482\n00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:59,612\nApple trusts the certificate provider\nthan it would have launched Just fine.\n\n483\n00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,376\nBut this is another non-signed app.\n\n484\n00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:02,136\nAnd it's telling me,\n\n485\n00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:04,810\nPlex Home Theater is an application\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n486\n00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,150\nAre you sure you want to open it?\n\n487\n00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,930\nIt's giving me a chance to verify\nthat yes, I trust this software.\n\n488\n00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,130\nOr no, I don't.\nI can cancel and that's the end of it and\n\n489\n00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,590\nI won't see it again.\n\n490\n00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,200\nAll right.\n\n491\n00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,460\nBut if I trust it, I can hit Open and\nit's gonna fire up that application and\n\n492\n00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,589\nnow I'm running\nthe amazingly black screen.\n\n493\n00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Plex Home Theater.\n\n494\n00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,160\nThat's kinda funny.\n\n495\n00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you've never seen, oh there it goes,\n\n496\n00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,830\nit was just taking a minute.\n\n497\n00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,680\nIf you've never seen Plex Home Theater,\nit's actually pretty awesome software.\n\n498\n00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,940\nIt's just running kinda slow because\nit's the first time I launched it.\n\n499\n00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,450\nBut but yeah so, you know, it's just gonna\nrun through its little thing here and\n\n500\n00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,810\nwe can kinda go through and do its little\nset up and, and launch and all that stuff.\n\n501\n00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,520\nSo so that, that's basically it.\n\n502\n00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,310\nBut installing application,\nnot a big deal.\n\n503\n00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,850\nApparently it really wants me to search,\ndoesn't it?\n\n504\n00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,420\nSo so that's kinda the, the, the process.\n\n505\n00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,740\nNow, once it's installed,\nyou run it, you use it, whatever.\n\n506\n00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,930\nAnd if you're done with it,\nif you're no longer gonna use it anymore,\n\n507\n00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,420\nyou need to get rid of it.\n\n508\n00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,390\nAnd the way you uninstall under\na Mac is different than Windows\n\n509\n00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,170\nbecause everything is\nkind of in this one file.\n\n510\n00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,930\nSo we don't really need an uninstaller.\n\n511\n00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,420\nAll you do is take that application and\nyou drag it.\n\n512\n00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,290\nAnd you take it down here\nto your recycle bin, and\n\n513\n00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,020\nI think my head is gonna\ncover that recycle bin up.\n\n514\n00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,880\nBut, but it,\nit's just right down there at the bottom.\n\n515\n00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,710\nI'll go ahead and drop it right in there.\n\n516\n00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,318\nAnd it uninstalls and,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n517\n00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:30,430\nIf this were an application that\nmodified the OS like Virtual Box,\n\n518\n00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,540\nwhen I did that it would prompt me for\nadministrator privileges.\n\n519\n00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,020\nCuz it's gotta get in there and\nundo those pieces.\n\n520\n00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,370\nSo that's gonna uninstall it,\nnow that software is gone.\n\n521\n00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,020\nIt took it all with it, right there.\n\n522\n00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,990\nSo the different OSs handle installations\na little bit differently, but the,\n\n523\n00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,140\nthe end result is the same.\n\n524\n00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,950\nYou guys see there's a lot of\nparallel features in those processes,\n\n525\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,180\njust slightly different implementation.\n\n526\n00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,290\n>> I liked how smooth it actually is\nin the Apple where very nice and easy,\n\n527\n00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,850\njust simply click and drag to the right\nlocation and you're ready to go.\n\n528\n00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,660\nWindows Installer,\n\n529\n00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,040\na little bit more traditional the way\nthat I've always seen it instead.\n\n530\n00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,630\nBut I do like the way that, that works.\n\n531\n00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,540\nIt's very nice.\n\n532\n00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,860\nMakes it easy.\n\n533\n00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,370\n>> Yup.\nSo installing and uninstalling,\n\n534\n00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,080\nreally straightforward.\n\n535\n00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,770\nJust remember, use your uninstaller.\n\n536\n00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,020\nIf you decide you don't wanna program\nanymore on Windows, don't just go and\n\n537\n00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,070\ndelete its folder.\n\n538\n00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,410\nThat's not enough, right.\n\n539\n00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,690\nAnd so if you go and do that it's\ngoing to leave remnants behind and\n\n540\n00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,460\nit's gonna cause problems.\n\n541\n00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,970\nGotta make sure you use your uninstaller.\n\n542\n00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,960\nThat's like, best practice number one.\n\n543\n00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,830\nBut even before you get to that\npoint on the installation side,\n\n544\n00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,980\nonly install software that you truly need.\n\n545\n00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,060\nDon't just go randomly\ninstalling things to try it out.\n\n546\n00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,340\nMake sure you download it from a trusted\nprovider and always pay attention\n\n547\n00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,570\non the installation steps to see if it's\ntrying to install any additional software.\n\n548\n00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,050\nSomething is piggybacking along side it,\nright.\n\n549\n00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,250\nNow we showed you installations there by\ndownloading from the various providers.\n\n550\n00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,430\nIf you're using one of the stores, the app\nstores, like the Microsoft Windows Store,\n\n551\n00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,310\nor the Apple App Store, it's a different\nexperience all together, isn't it?\n\n552\n00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,080\nYou browse the store.\n\n553\n00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,230\nLet me,\nlet me just show you one real quick.\n\n554\n00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,370\nYou browse the store,\nI'll fire up my app store here, and\n\n555\n00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,570\nyou find the application\nthat you're looking for.\n\n556\n00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,230\nSo for example I was doing video\nconverters earlier, right, so I might go\n\n557\n00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,400\nin here and do a search for video\nconverter, which I think I spelled wrong.\n\n558\n00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,920\nAnd, but well,\nwe actually found some stuff.\n\n559\n00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,030\nHere's a video, audio converter.\n\n560\n00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,650\nCosts a whopping $3.\n\n561\n00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,630\nAnd so you can click on it and\ntake a look at it.\n\n562\n00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,300\nOn a nice side you know that\nwhile you might not have ever\n\n563\n00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,490\nheard of the software before,\nthat at least Apple pre-screened it and\n\n564\n00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,640\nsaid it was okay and threw it in here.\n\n565\n00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,580\nAnd so it's available and\nyou can go and purchase it.\n\n566\n00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,680\nAnd we click on that,\nit's gonna offer to buy it.\n\n567\n00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,595\nAnd once it's bought, this button will\nchange to install, and you install it.\n\n568\n00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:43,240\nAnd it runs through and\ninputs it on your system.\n\n569\n00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:50,110\nSo kinda nice to actually have that more\nsimple way of discovering applications and\n\n570\n00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,520\nknowing that they're safe, versus the\nInternet where you gotta do your research.\n\n571\n00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,575\nRight, you've just, you, you find these\nsites you've never heard of before,\n\n572\n00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:59,500\nyou gotta learn more about that product\nbefore you, you pull the trigger on it.\n\n573\n00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,420\n>> Same thing would be done\nin the Windows Store but\n\n574\n00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,250\nyou can only be on Windows 8 or 8.1\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n575\n00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,090\n>> To be able to get in there.\n\n576\n00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,160\nSo I brought up the I brought up the\nWindows Store and kinda looks the same,\n\n577\n00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,780\nwhere you do see different applications\nthat you can pick and choose from.\n\n578\n00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,530\nAnd remember that these\nare already pre-screened for us so\n\n579\n00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,030\nthat we can be able to pick and\nchoose what we want.\n\n580\n00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,810\nSo that's like, like books and reference.\n\n581\n00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,926\nThen you can choose, and so for example,\n\n582\n00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:35,033\nI want the Kindle Trying to look for\nthe, where did I pull it in?\n\n583\n00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,265\n[LAUGH] Where is that thing?\n\n584\n00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:40,850\n[LAUGH] Now, now it's become challenging.\n\n585\n00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,690\nWhere is the installer for that thing?\n\n586\n00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,010\n>> Do you?\n\n587\n00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,750\n>> Maybe I already have it installed.\n\n588\n00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,680\nOkay.\n\n589\n00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520\nI don't know.\n\n590\n00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,400\n>> It's not giving the option.\n\n591\n00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,090\n>> No,\nit's not giving me the option there.\n\n592\n00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,080\nThere you go, that's, that's awesome.\n\n593\n00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,700\nI mean, why would it why would it actually\ngive me, so what about Asphalt 8?\n\n594\n00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,600\nThere we go.\n\n595\n00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,370\nInstall [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n596\n00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,745\non this one you see an install button.\n\n597\n00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,105\nThis one must be free\n>> Yes.\n\n598\n00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:08,864\n>> Which means it's probably\nad-supported or whatever.\n\n599\n00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:13,052\nBut a lot of them will have a purchase\nbutton so you can buy it and, and jump in.\n\n600\n00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,939\nYeah, I guess this one is free or\na demo or something like that.\n\n601\n00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,540\n1.5 gigs, that's pretty big.\n\n602\n00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,432\n>> For a free one, yeah.\n\n603\n00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,008\nThere you go.\n\n604\n00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,940\n>> [LAUGH] All right so, so\n\n605\n00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,180\ndon't expect that app store model\nto go away anytime soon, right.\n\n606\n00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,550\nA lot of vendors are moving to that,\nwe're gonna see that more and\n\n607\n00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,572\nmore going forward.\n\n608\n00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:30,230\nSo that'll be where we start\nto go to get our applications.\n\n609\n00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,172\nBut in today's world,\n\n610\n00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,770\ngetting them straight from\nthe Internet is still just as common.\n\n611\n00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,020\nAll right, so that's basically it for\ninstalling and uninstalling software.\n\n612\n00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,740\nWe do have more to talk about.\n\n613\n00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,380\nWe were talking about applications.\n\n614\n00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,030\nWe also need to take a look at drivers,\nuninstalling and installing drivers,\n\n615\n00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,950\nwhich is actually very similar.\n\n616\n00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,809\nSo yeah, we don't really have\nenough time to do that though.\n\n617\n00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,410\nSo let's, let's stop and take a break, and\n\n618\n00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,910\nwhen we get back we'll talk more about\ndrivers and getting them installed.\n\n619\n00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,480\n>> And then we need to talk about\nthe really important topic of once you get\n\n620\n00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,610\nthe software installed,\nkeeping it up to date.\n\n621\n00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,888\nSo we'll tackle that too after this.\n\n622\n00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:10,493\n[MUSIC]\n\n623\n00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,818\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n624\n00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:16,903\nSo we took a look at installing software,\n\n625\n00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:21,050\nand software programs are usually\nwhere a lot of our problems come from.\n\n626\n00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,930\nThere is another area that we need to be\ncareful with is very very similar and\n\n627\n00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,080\nthat's installing drivers.\n\n628\n00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,490\nWhen you add new hardware to your\ncomputer, if you hook a new printer up, or\n\n629\n00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,380\na new mouse, something like that,\n\n630\n00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,220\nthat you're attaching to your system,\nyou'll likely need\n\n631\n00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,480\ndriver software to let you operating\nsystem know how to talk to that hardware.\n\n632\n00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,340\nNow fortunately, most operating system\nvendors are doing a great job of including\n\n633\n00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,730\ndrivers with the system.\n\n634\n00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,710\nSo if you're running Windows or\nif you're running Mac OS,\n\n635\n00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,750\na lot of times you'll hook that\nprinter up, and it'll just work.\n\n636\n00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,635\nYou, you won't have to\nload any drivers at all,\n\n637\n00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,656\nit'll already have the stuff in there.\n\n638\n00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,080\nWindows 8 is really good about that.\n\n639\n00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,520\nIt reaches out to the Internet and\npulls all sorts of drivers.\n\n640\n00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,420\nSo it, it makes life really easy.\n\n641\n00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,040\nBut sometimes you have to install drivers.\n\n642\n00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,020\nAnd one of the, the best pieces\nof advice that we can give you is\n\n643\n00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,680\nthat when you're about to add new\nhardware, it's gonna come with a CD or\n\n644\n00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,480\nUSB stick or something that'll\nhave the drivers on there.\n\n645\n00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,530\nWhen you buy that, whatever's on\nthat disk is already out of date.\n\n646\n00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,380\nIf you think about it,\nthey had to manufacture that printer, and\n\n647\n00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,380\nprint the driver disk, and stick it in the\nbox and then it got shipped to a store,\n\n648\n00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,980\nprobably sat on a shelf for a few weeks or\nmonths before you bought it.\n\n649\n00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,380\nAnd the odds are that disk\nwas printed several months\n\n650\n00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,340\nprior to when you actually\nreceived the object.\n\n651\n00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,790\nAnd that means the drivers\nare out of date.\n\n652\n00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,421\nSo when you get new hardware,\n\n653\n00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:45,991\nyou might wanna consider just foregoing\nthe installation CDs altogether and going\n\n654\n00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:50,575\nto the hardware vendor's website to get\nthe latest and greatest drivers, right?\n\n655\n00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,781\nAnd that's something that\nI do just out of hand.\n\n656\n00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:56,910\nIt, it's what I, I have pretty much have,\nhave trained myself, is ignore the disk it\n\n657\n00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,986\ncame with, go right to the vendor site and\ndownload from there.\n\n658\n00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:03,120\nSo to show an example I,\nI've got our office printer here.\n\n659\n00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,019\nWe have this gigantic printer that\ndoes magic It makes balloon animals.\n\n660\n00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,133\nIt does all sorts of crazy things.\n\n661\n00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:09,830\n>> It does.\n\n662\n00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,168\n>> And it's called an imageRunner from\nCanon, and if I wanna print to it, well,\n\n663\n00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:19,110\nMac OS doesn't have a driver for that\nby default, so I've got to install one.\n\n664\n00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,330\nAnd so I just went to their website,\nand I pulled up the imageRunner 7065,\n\n665\n00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,470\nand they've got all sorts of stuff,\nspecifications, white papers and so\n\n666\n00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,480\non, and I went to drivers.\n\n667\n00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,550\nAnd down here, you'll see where it's\ntrying to figure out my operating system,\n\n668\n00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,410\nand that's because they have drivers for\nall sorts of different OSs.\n\n669\n00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,510\nIf I was running Windows 7, I would\njust go up here and find Windows 7 and\n\n670\n00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:46,730\nI've got regular Windows 7, which is 32\nbit, or Windows 7 X64, which is 64 bit and\n\n671\n00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,210\nI could pick that driver, and\nhere's the installation files for that.\n\n672\n00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,980\nOr for me, I'm running Mac OS,\nand I'm running 10.10,\n\n673\n00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,130\nso that's what it detected but you'll\nsee the other ones to choose from too,\n\n674\n00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,160\nand then you'll see those drivers and\nyou need to pick the appropriate one.\n\n675\n00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,470\nNow for mine, there's more than\none driver, what does that mean?\n\n676\n00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,240\nWell, some of this is simple.\n\n677\n00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,530\nA lot of times they'll post new versions\nand old versions of the driver.\n\n678\n00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,719\nSo notice there's this\nUFRII version 10.06, and\n\n679\n00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,784\ndown here is UFRII version 10.05.\n\n680\n00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:20,860\nThis is the older version, right?\n\n681\n00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,420\nSo we usually want the newest version and\n\n682\n00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,770\nthere's different drivers for\ndifferent things here.\n\n683\n00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,750\nIf I wanna use the fax service on that\nprinter, there's one driver for that but\n\n684\n00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,990\nif I just wanna print,\nthere's the other one, right?\n\n685\n00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,160\nAnd then, in the world of printers,\nthere's different languages you can use.\n\n686\n00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,960\nYou can choose to use postscript,\nwhich is PS.\n\n687\n00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,370\nSo if I want the postscript driver,\nit's right there.\n\n688\n00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,860\nSo, I'm having to do a lot of decisions.\n\n689\n00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,960\nIf this is something like a video card\nthough, it's a different story there.\n\n690\n00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,930\nRight, if we take something like Nvidia,\nwho makes high end\n\n691\n00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,740\ngraphics cards, then we can go to\ntheir website and we'll go to drivers,\n\n692\n00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,580\nand we'll pull up GeForce drivers.\n\n693\n00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,230\nThis is their graphics cards and\nyou can go in and\n\n694\n00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,540\ntell it what graphics card that you have.\n\n695\n00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,790\nSo, my computer at home, I have a,\n\n696\n00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,670\noh, don't tell me they ditched\nmy series of card already.\n\n697\n00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,140\nI've got a GTX 760.\n\n698\n00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,210\nI love how they start out\nwith the highest one.\n\n699\n00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,770\nThe one nobody can afford.\n\n700\n00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,120\nSo that's what I have, right there.\n\n701\n00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,030\nSo I can come down and\nI can pick that, and\n\n702\n00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,700\nI can tell it what operating\nsystem I'm running.\n\n703\n00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,340\nSo on my computer at home, I'm actually\nrunning Windows 8 64-bit and I can\n\n704\n00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,020\nstart my search, and it will find that\ndriver and unlike in the printer world,\n\n705\n00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,100\nwhere I had ten different drivers to\npick from, here it's just one driver.\n\n706\n00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,053\nIt's one driver but different versions of\nit, they've released newer and newer and\n\n707\n00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:44,483\nnewer ones and so\nI'll see 344.11, 344.48, 344.60.\n\n708\n00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,884\nYou typically want the newest one,\nall right.\n\n709\n00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,130\nWhen you download the driver,\nyou just install it.\n\n710\n00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,800\nJust like we showed with\nthe software from before,\n\n711\n00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,230\nexcept drivers always require\nadministrative privileges.\n\n712\n00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,010\nIn Windows, Microsoft requires that\nthe drivers be digitally signed, so\n\n713\n00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,680\nif it's not digitally signed,\nit won't install.\n\n714\n00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,890\nIt's part of the trustworthy computing.\n\n715\n00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,750\nOn Mac OS, it doesn't require\nthem to be digitally signed but\n\n716\n00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,300\nit does require you be\nan administrator to do it.\n\n717\n00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,860\nA regular user can't install a driver.\n\n718\n00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,290\nSo if I were to download one of these,\nlike I'll download the URFI one.\n\n719\n00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,688\nSo if I go and download this thing.\n\n720\n00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,450\nI may regret this but we'll see.\n\n721\n00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,495\nSo I'll go and download it.\n\n722\n00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:28,340\nActually, I think I might already have it\ninstalled but I'll just download it, and\n\n723\n00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,960\nit'll basically be a package of PKG\nfiles that I double-click on, and\n\n724\n00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,580\nWindows is just an executable that you\nrun and then it installs the driver.\n\n725\n00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,770\nNow, once the driver is installed,\nI should be able to use that hardware,\n\n726\n00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,960\nand oh, this is nice.\n\n727\n00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,180\nIt was a ZIP, and\nthen inside of it is a DMG.\n\n728\n00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,690\nSo they have unnecessarily nested\nthis stuff but if I open up the DMG,\n\n729\n00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,280\nI can get in there and\nI'll see the package.\n\n730\n00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,170\nThere it is.\n\n731\n00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,900\nTo actually go and\ninstall that on my system, all right.\n\n732\n00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,850\nAnd because it requires drivers, well,\n\n733\n00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,820\nit's gonna require\nadministrative privileges.\n\n734\n00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,460\nSo as I move forward with this installer,\nit's going to ask about that but\n\n735\n00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,900\notherwise, it's the same\nas installing software.\n\n736\n00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,762\nIt's just going to enable my\nOS to talk to that hardware.\n\n737\n00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,520\nAll right, now, with drivers,\nit's really no different than software.\n\n738\n00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,890\nOnce you install them, you use them,\nwhen you no longer need them,\n\n739\n00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,562\nif you've gotten rid of that hardware,\n\n740\n00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:24,630\nit is a good idea to uninstall\nthe driver if you don't need it anymore.\n\n741\n00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,340\nNow, with Windows, it's pretty easy\nbecause the drivers will show up on add or\n\n742\n00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,780\nremove programs.\n\n743\n00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,050\nWith Mac, it's a little bit more difficult\nbecause the drivers don't show up under\n\n744\n00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,070\nthe application folder.\n\n745\n00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,340\nYou have to browse into\nyour system folders and\n\n746\n00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,880\nthere's a folder in there where you\ncan get to them and remove them but\n\n747\n00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,150\na lot of times as you remove that\nhardware, it'll prompt to remove it for\n\n748\n00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,950\nyou automatically and it'll take those\nout, so you don't have to worry about\n\n749\n00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,680\nactually going and hunting for\nthose files, all right?\n\n750\n00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,570\nSo drivers are just a little bit different\nbut once we've installed the driver and\n\n751\n00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,870\nwe're ready to rock,\nthere's not too much to do.\n\n752\n00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,720\nRonnie, did you want to show\na driver on the Windows side, or.\n\n753\n00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,660\n>> Sure.\n\n754\n00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,420\nYeah.\n\n755\n00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,870\nOn my Windows machine,\nit's about the same process.\n\n756\n00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,880\nThe nice thing is that we do have a menu,\nso once I went into control panel,\n\n757\n00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,230\nthere's a place called devices and\nprinters and actually,\n\n758\n00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,510\nyou can see it right here on Windows 7.\n\n759\n00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,550\nIt's listed separately, and then,\non the top, I can select, Add a Printer.\n\n760\n00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,430\n>> Or Add a Device if it's not a printer.\n\n761\n00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,303\n>> Yeah, or add a device.\n\n762\n00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,953\n>> Yeah, it's the same thing.\n\n763\n00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:22,642\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then, I'm just gonna add a local one\n\n764\n00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:27,270\nand here's a port, we're gonna choose,\nand here is the list of drivers.\n\n765\n00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,320\nSo you pick whatever manufacturer that\nyou're gonna find, so we had a Canon.\n\n766\n00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,150\nI don't think that the one that\nwe have is actually in there.\n\n767\n00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,650\n>> Yeah, if it's in the list,\n\n768\n00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,205\nthen by all means,\nuse the one that Microsoft provides.\n\n769\n00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:42,445\nThey've tested it, you know it's secure\nand one of the nice things and we're gonna\n\n770\n00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:46,675\ntalk about this in a minute, is if you use\nthe Microsoft driver, it'll automatically\n\n771\n00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:50,475\nupdate when new updates come out,\nit's automatic and that's kind of nice.\n\n772\n00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:53,075\nIf you install it from\nthe vendor like I did,\n\n773\n00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:56,095\nwell, there I'm gonna have\nto do the updates myself.\n\n774\n00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,080\n>> Yeah, this one didn't have it.\n\n775\n00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,130\nSo normally, if you don't have it\nin here and Windows is saying hey,\n\n776\n00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,890\nI need a driver, if you want to go ahead\nand download it, you can instead select\n\n777\n00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,580\nHave a Disk, and you point at the location\nat where that drivers going to be, and\n\n778\n00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,580\nit can find the file it needs and\ninstall right away.\n\n779\n00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,040\nSo that's normally all it takes\nto get this driver installed.\n\n780\n00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,790\n>> All right, now I mentioned updates,\nlet's talk about that for a minute.\n\n781\n00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,490\nOnce you install software,\nyou need to maintain the software and\n\n782\n00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,420\nthis is the biggest\nmistake that people make.\n\n783\n00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,410\nThey install a program, and don't use it\nvery frequently and it just sits there,\n\n784\n00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,450\nand a year goes by and in that year,\nwhoever developed the software finds some\n\n785\n00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,590\nmajor exploits, major problems with it,\nand they fix them but you haven't updated.\n\n786\n00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,920\nSo you're still running the old\nversion of the software, and\n\n787\n00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,600\nyour computer is now vulnerable\nto attacks or compromises.\n\n788\n00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,240\nSo, we've gotta make sure that\nwe update our operating systems,\n\n789\n00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,730\nthat's mission critical, right?\n\n790\n00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,730\nYou gotta update your operating system but\n\n791\n00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,690\nwe also have to update our applications\nand the more applications you have,\n\n792\n00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,200\nthe more difficult that becomes and\na lot of people are bad about it.\n\n793\n00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,210\nAnd that's one of the reasons so\nmany people get infected with viruses and\n\n794\n00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,180\nthings, where they're running web browsers\nthat haven't been updated, older web\n\n795\n00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,540\nbrowsers are more susceptible to attack or\nthey're running things like Java.\n\n796\n00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,160\nFor our live viewers, we were kind of\njoking around about Java during the break.\n\n797\n00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,450\nThere's a new Java update every two days,\njust about.\n\n798\n00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,090\nIt is constantly being updated because\nthere's tons of the exploits and flaws in\n\n799\n00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,910\nit and if you let it go more than a week\nwithout updating, you are vulnerable.\n\n800\n00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,070\nSo you've gotta keep all these\ndifferent pieces up to date,\n\n801\n00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,060\nand you gotta stay on top of it.\n\n802\n00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,590\nSo installing software, it's not\nsomething where you just install it and\n\n803\n00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,120\nthen forget it.\n\n804\n00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,070\nIt's kind of like getting a new pet,\nright?\n\n805\n00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,150\nYou gotta feed it every day, you gotta\ntake care of it and with software,\n\n806\n00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,350\nthat means doing our updates.\n\n807\n00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,810\n>> Yeah, one of the most amazing things\nin the past several years is that\n\n808\n00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,620\noperating systems have gotten so good at\nthe regular updates that they've done,\n\n809\n00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,620\nis that they're no longer\nthe primary point of attack for\n\n810\n00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,120\nmost hackers to try to get some type\nof vulnerability into your system.\n\n811\n00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,902\nToday, they're really focusing in on\nthese applications because they realized\n\n812\n00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:03,513\nsomething.\n\n813\n00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:06,925\nThat even though you are updating your\noperating system, most people are not\n\n814\n00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:10,199\nupdating the applications that\nare running on those operating systems.\n\n815\n00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,057\nSo, that has now actually kind of\nleapfrogged and become the number one\n\n816\n00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:17,461\npoint of attack, third party\napplications that get added on,\n\n817\n00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,340\ninstead of the operating system itself.\n\n818\n00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,600\nSo, you really need to be very careful\nabout this, especially if you're gonna\n\n819\n00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,378\nbe using that application daily, and you\ngo, I'll just keep ignoring the update.\n\n820\n00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:31,110\nAfter a while, you're gonna\nactually have a vulnerability, and\n\n821\n00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,320\nthat's something we don't\nwant in our systems.\n\n822\n00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,500\n>> And what ushered that along was\nthe OS vendors started introducing\n\n823\n00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,130\nautomatic updates.\n\n824\n00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,630\nWhere you didn't have to worry about it.\n\n825\n00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,080\nYour computer would do the updates for\nyou.\n\n826\n00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,700\nAll right.\n\n827\n00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,280\nNow, most of our users out there running,\nare running Windows machines, so\n\n828\n00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,800\nwhy don't we start with that, you wanna\nshow the automatic updates in Windows?\n\n829\n00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,550\n>> Yup.\n\n830\n00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,050\nSo, in Windows, we have the nice\nautomatic update, I went ahead and\n\n831\n00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,250\nbrought it up here.\n\n832\n00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,150\nBut in control panel\n>> Show,\n\n833\n00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,995\nshow how you got to that screen Ronnie.\n\n834\n00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:00,630\nYup, so if I go to, in windows 8.1 here,\nit's a little bit easy.\n\n835\n00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,700\nLet me go to Windows 7 machine,\nmake it easier on us.\n\n836\n00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,930\nI was doing it from the wrong machine.\n\n837\n00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,850\nSo if I go ahead and click on the start\nbutton and I can go into the control\n\n838\n00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,910\npanel, snd inside of control panel,\nsystem and security.\n\n839\n00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,190\nAnd you'll see that right here,\nin this list for system and security\n\n840\n00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,170\nis windows update, and they have this\nturn on or turn off automatic updates.\n\n841\n00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,480\nI am just going to click on it to give us\nthe full view of what we see, and this one\n\n842\n00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,550\nis not turned on, so updates are not being\ninstalled automatically, and it's giving\n\n843\n00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,800\nus this option right now, to say hey,\ndo you want to turn on automatic updates?\n\n844\n00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,990\nBetter say yes.\n\n845\n00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,460\n>> Can you, you don't have to,\nyou, you could leave it at manual\n\n846\n00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,120\nif you were gonna be good about it and\nactually do the updates when you want it.\n\n847\n00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,960\nBut most people are not good about it and\nthey forget, and then it sits here and,\n\n848\n00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,820\nand you end up with a machine that's\nout of date, so here it says, hey,\n\n849\n00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,960\nto install new update software, so,\nthis machine is a little bit old, and\n\n850\n00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,200\nit's saying there's even new\nWindows Update software.\n\n851\n00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,380\nWell, you know if you're\nupdater's out of date, [LAUGH]\n\n852\n00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,190\n>> The updater needs to be updated.\n\n853\n00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,280\n>> Yeah.\nThat's pretty hefty when you have\n\n854\n00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,650\nsomething like that going on.\n\n855\n00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,720\nSo, if I go and select it, you'll see\nit's connecting to Microsoft, and\n\n856\n00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,090\nit's downloading the new Windows Update,\nand it says it's going to\n\n857\n00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,860\nautomatically close and\nreopen once everything is actually done.\n\n858\n00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,810\nNow, the nice thing about automatic\nupdates, is exactly that,\n\n859\n00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,000\nis that it happens in\nthe background without you and\n\n860\n00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,990\nI ever really needing to pay attention\nto it, and so there it goes.\n\n861\n00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,870\nIt actually looks like it closed out.\n\n862\n00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,999\n>> Yeah, I don't know if it will relaunch.\n\n863\n00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,449\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, let's go ahead and\n\n864\n00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:37,330\nbring it back up, so I'm going to go\nback to start, and then control panel.\n\n865\n00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,760\nIt sure did.\n\n866\n00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,040\nNow the windows updater has updated,\nit's now going out and checking,\n\n867\n00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,280\nthere's probably like 130 updates for\nthis thing or even more.\n\n868\n00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,400\nBut it is, it's just going out and\n\n869\n00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,500\nsaying I'm going to check out every single\nupdate that you've missed in the past.\n\n870\n00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,720\nAnd that's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n871\n00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,990\nIt might take a while before it's done.\n\n872\n00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,440\n>> Well, while we're waiting on that,\nwhen you set up Windows updates it\n\n873\n00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,250\ndoes use some default settings\nthat you might want to manipulate.\n\n874\n00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,550\nSo let's take a look at those settings\nwhile we're waiting on that to check.\n\n875\n00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,830\nAnd And you'll see right here that the\ndefault is your computer will check for\n\n876\n00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,518\nupdates ever day at 3:00 a.m.\n\n877\n00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:15,690\nThe idea that it being 3:00 a.m.\n\n878\n00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,900\nis the middle of the night.\n\n879\n00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,210\nYou're not using your computer.\n\n880\n00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,740\nIt can go and find updates,\nit can download them, install them and\n\n881\n00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,440\neven reboot your computer if necessary\nto get the updates put in place.\n\n882\n00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,900\nThat way you don't even\nhave to think about it.\n\n883\n00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,820\nYour computer's just\nautomatically kept up to date.\n\n884\n00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,340\nAnd that's what's really been\nputting the push on attackers.\n\n885\n00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,390\nAttackers used to be able to find\nan exploit and they knew there would be\n\n886\n00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,790\nthousands upon thousands of people\non the Internet that hadn't updated.\n\n887\n00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,630\nBut now because it's automatic, it becomes\nmuch harder to target that, all right?\n\n888\n00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,890\nBut, you can change the time and day.\n\n889\n00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,080\nMaybe, maybe you work a, a day shift,\nand, or you work a night shift, and\n\n890\n00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,130\nthis is when you use your computer.\n\n891\n00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,080\nYou're using it at three a.m.\n\n892\n00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,470\nSo, you might wanna change\nit to a different time slot.\n\n893\n00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,910\nOr you might even say, go ahead and\ndownload the updates, but\n\n894\n00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,790\ndon't install them.\n\n895\n00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,070\nIf you drop down that box where it\nsays install updates automatically,\n\n896\n00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,520\nthere you can choose to download it,\nand let us pick when they install,\n\n897\n00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,995\nor, or don't even download, just check for\nupdates and Let me know where there's new\n\n898\n00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:15,855\nones so you can manipulate the behavior\nbut the best choice is install\n\n899\n00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:20,075\nupdates automatically and pick a time when\nyou know you're not using your computer.\n\n900\n00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,775\nNow if you shut off your computer at\nnight it's not gonna be able to run\n\n901\n00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:23,980\nthe updates is it?\n\n902\n00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,920\nSo it does need to be a time\nwhen the computer is on so\n\n903\n00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,490\nit will be able to reach out and\ndo that stuff.\n\n904\n00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,450\n>> Yeah, the important thing to\nnotice here is there's really two\n\n905\n00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,140\nclasses of updates for us.\n\n906\n00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,820\nWe have the important updates\nwhich are essential to Windows.\n\n907\n00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,070\nThey're saying look this absolutely\nshould be on your computer,\n\n908\n00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,860\nand then we have these\nrecommended updates.\n\n909\n00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,430\nWhich are saying here's something\nthat we recommend that you do but\n\n910\n00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,420\nit's not necessarily going to\nbe what they consider important.\n\n911\n00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,980\nA lot of the times I just go ahead and put\nthe check box here anyways and then I can\n\n912\n00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,185\nactually see when it installed or when it\ndidn't And install when everything's done.\n\n913\n00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:02,975\n>> All right, so let's take a look\nat the same thing but on a Mac.\n\n914\n00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:07,005\nMac's are the same way, Apple actually\nmanages their software DOS through their\n\n915\n00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:10,697\napp store, so the automatic updates on an\napple are actually handled through there,\n\n916\n00:45:10,697 --> 00:45:13,577\nYou could go to the app store, but\nwe have settings, just like in Windows.\n\n917\n00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,487\nAnd I'm going to go up to\nmy apple menu here and\n\n918\n00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:17,677\nI'm going to go to system preferences.\n\n919\n00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:18,877\nAnd in my system preferences,\n\n920\n00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:23,847\nif I go to app store, it's going to show\nthe preferences for my automatic updates.\n\n921\n00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,027\nAnd, you can see where I've\nset mine to manual and\n\n922\n00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:29,497\nI did that because there is an update\navailable, as I want to show that process.\n\n923\n00:45:29,497 --> 00:45:31,960\nBut here,\nI'll see automatically check for updates.\n\n924\n00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,970\nAnd then download newly available updates\nin the background, we can download that\n\n925\n00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,250\nand if I choose that, I can choose\nwhether or not I want them to install.\n\n926\n00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,650\nMaybe I want it to download it,\nbut not install it just yet.\n\n927\n00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,340\nSo, I've got that, that option\nto be able to control that, and\n\n928\n00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,870\nthen if I want,\nI can manually do the check right now.\n\n929\n00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,380\nI can let it do its own check or I can\nforce the check to happen right now, and\n\n930\n00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,090\nwhen you force the check, all it's really\ndoing is going into the app store.\n\n931\n00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,440\nSo if I launch my app store here,\nyou've got this update option.\n\n932\n00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,000\nIf I hit Check Now all it would of\nreally done is taken me right here and\n\n933\n00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,190\nI'd see any updates that were available,\nand I can see that I've got an update for\n\n934\n00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,390\none of my programs right now, and\nI can choose to update right now.\n\n935\n00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,750\nIf there was an update to OS 10,\nto the actual operating system.\n\n936\n00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,910\nI would see that in the list and\nI would be able to hit update.\n\n937\n00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,690\nBut because this is the app store I'll\nalso see applications in here too.\n\n938\n00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,230\nI don't have any updates\nto OS 10 right now, but\n\n939\n00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,040\nI do have an update to Microsoft remote\ndesktop that I have installed in here.\n\n940\n00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,040\nAnd so I can just hit update and\nit will apply that.\n\n941\n00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,680\nIt might actually prompt me for a password\n'cause it's all tied to your Apple ID.\n\n942\n00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,350\nBut it will reach out and\ndo the install, so\n\n943\n00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,830\nit's telling me that's it's installing\nand, it just updated to somewhere in here.\n\n944\n00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,300\nI guess it disappeared.\n\n945\n00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,430\nNormally it shows right here\nupdates installed in the last 30\n\n946\n00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,050\ndays, oh, there it is!\n\n947\n00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,490\nI was just being impatient.\n\n948\n00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,380\nSo there's the update, it's applied and\nnow we're good to go, right?\n\n949\n00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n950\n00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,740\n>> Now, again, just like on the Windows\nside, the best practice is to go ahead and\n\n951\n00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,495\nhave this be automatic,, and so,\nI normally keep mine configured This way.\n\n952\n00:47:03,495 --> 00:47:07,295\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm saying anytime\nthere's an update I want you to download\n\n953\n00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:07,965\nit and install it.\n\n954\n00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:10,375\nDon't wait for me to deal with it.\n\n955\n00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,365\nAnd if there's any system data files that\nneed to be installed, do that too, right.\n\n956\n00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:17,385\nThose are, those are usually where\nApple detects some kind of exploit and\n\n957\n00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:19,015\nthey push an update out for that.\n\n958\n00:47:19,015 --> 00:47:22,805\nAnd then I've got if somebody buys\nan app with my ID on another computer,\n\n959\n00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,045\nit'll automatically install it here.\n\n960\n00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:26,130\nI actually usually do keep that off.\n\n961\n00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,320\nSo those are my settings\nthat I usually use.\n\n962\n00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,930\nJust the best practice\nto have it be automatic.\n\n963\n00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,486\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n964\n00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:33,520\n>> How's your update looking?\n\n965\n00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,990\n>> It's not looking great, but\nif we check on my computer,\n\n966\n00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,740\nyou'll actually see-\n>> There's a few.\n\n967\n00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n968\n00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:39,775\nI'm missing just a few updates.\n\n969\n00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the nice thing is since we've\n\n970\n00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,280\nturned on the automatic update scheduler\n\n971\n00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,970\nyou'll see in this pop up\nbottle that actually showed up,\n\n972\n00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,130\nthese updates will be installed next\ntime we shut down our computer.\n\n973\n00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,430\nOr at four PM on the fourth\nwhich is today at four PM.\n\n974\n00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,700\nSo about an hour from now.\n\n975\n00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,541\nInstalling updates my\ncollege computer restart, so\n\n976\n00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,645\nit at least notifies me that\nhere's what needs to happen.\n\n977\n00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:04,171\nSo it's gonna go Through and\nactually do this or I can go ahead and\n\n978\n00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:07,634\ntell it to manually click and\nbegin the installation process,\n\n979\n00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:12,105\nand this is gonna help keep my operating\nsystem as, as updated as possible.\n\n980\n00:48:12,105 --> 00:48:14,339\nMaking sure it's get all\nthe security updates that it needs.\n\n981\n00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:19,162\nAnd also, you'll actually see that\nbecause Microsoft Office is integrated\n\n982\n00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:23,908\nin with Windows, a lot of times, a lot\nof these updates are probably gonna be\n\n983\n00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:29,340\nupdating even another application, just\nlike what we saw over on the Apple side.\n\n984\n00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,600\nWe're saying, hey,\nI wanna go ahead and do that.\n\n985\n00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,100\nBut some applications\nthat aren't updating,\n\n986\n00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,460\nwell I have FileZilla running and\nI'm running an older version of FileZilla,\n\n987\n00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,820\nthe nice thing is it tells me right here\nat the top a new version is available.\n\n988\n00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,620\nSo, they're even prompting me and\nletting me know, saying hey, there's a new\n\n989\n00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,722\nversion out there and it may be something\nI wanna go ahead and download an update.\n\n990\n00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:57,130\nAnd you'll see that there's a nice little\ninstall button for us to go ahead and\n\n991\n00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,950\nbegin that install when we're ready to go.\n\n992\n00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,830\n>> Yeah, and\nFilezilla is really good about it.\n\n993\n00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,548\nIf you have an application that's\nnot integrated into the OS,\n\n994\n00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:05,149\nwhich most of them aren't, right?\n\n995\n00:49:05,149 --> 00:49:09,084\nYou mentioned Microsoft Office, that's by\nMicrosoft, that's why it's integrated into\n\n996\n00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:11,970\nWindows Update, but any third party\nsoftware is not gonna do that.\n\n997\n00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:16,063\nAnd on the Apple side,\nit's only apps you get from the app store,\n\n998\n00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:20,140\nanything you buy direct,\nit's not gonna show up, right?\n\n999\n00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,520\nSo, for those applications,\nyou got to go and check.\n\n1000\n00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,450\nAnd I like FileZilla, cuz if you\nwere to close out of FileZilla, and\n\n1001\n00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,860\nlaunch it again.\n\n1002\n00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,060\nGo ahead and do it Ronny.\n\n1003\n00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,390\nWhen you close out of FileZilla and\n\n1004\n00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,620\nlaunch it again,\nit does the update check automatically.\n\n1005\n00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,850\nAnd there's the pop-up.\n\n1006\n00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,550\nSo, I mean, it's in your face,\nletting you know.\n\n1007\n00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,840\nSome program aren't, some, you have to go\nand actually go to the vendor's website,\n\n1008\n00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,350\nand look for an update, and\nyou don't get a notification.\n\n1009\n00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,910\nSo, often do you do that?\n\n1010\n00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:47,740\nDo you check every day?\n\n1011\n00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,200\nDo you check once a month?\n\n1012\n00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,410\nYou just need to check regularly,\nreach out.\n\n1013\n00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,240\nFileZilla, real easy,\nright there in the software.\n\n1014\n00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,250\nOther programs do the same thing.\n\n1015\n00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,120\nYou'll see different software\nthat does checks like that.\n\n1016\n00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,640\nI'm trying to think of some of\nthe programs that I run that do checks for\n\n1017\n00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,710\nupdates, there's many,\nmany different ones.\n\n1018\n00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,600\nAnd here, let me show you one that I use,\nI use a program called ExpanDrive,\n\n1019\n00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,730\nit's this little accordion icon up here.\n\n1020\n00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,050\nAnd it let's me connect to all\nsorts of different storage, so\n\n1021\n00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,700\nI use that to manage our Amazon S3 and\nall that stuff.\n\n1022\n00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,150\nBut this one, it will warn me every now\nand then if there is an update, but\n\n1023\n00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,200\notherwise, I don't really\nknow looking at it, and\n\n1024\n00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,200\neven if I go looking at the Manager\nhere it doesn't really tell me.\n\n1025\n00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,170\nBut when I go under Settings, it's got\nan option in here to check for updates,\n\n1026\n00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,060\nand it's set to automatically check,\nso it's good software.\n\n1027\n00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,750\nBut if I want to check on my own,\nI can do that, and\n\n1028\n00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,540\nit'll reach out and, well, sure enough,\nthere's a new version, all right?\n\n1029\n00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,570\nAnd, it's just telling me this new version\ncame out, and does it have a date on it?\n\n1030\n00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:50,040\nLike, how long has it been, have I\nbeen ignoring this update for a while?\n\n1031\n00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,600\nIt's not really telling me,\n\n1032\n00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,550\nit's just telling me I had to have\nrenewed or whatever, which I did.\n\n1033\n00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,990\nBut, an update came out, it's been out,\nand I didn't know, right?\n\n1034\n00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,090\nSo, I could say, automatically\ndownload and install in the future,\n\n1035\n00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,260\nand that's what I should have done,\napparently I didn't.\n\n1036\n00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,790\nAnd so I'll go ahead and\ntell it to go ahead and do it,\n\n1037\n00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,110\nnow it's going to go ahead and\nupdate that software.\n\n1038\n00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,230\nThe key thing to remember here,\nis you might install software and\n\n1039\n00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,520\nnot use it regularly.\n\n1040\n00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,760\nIt might have been weeks or\n\n1041\n00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,000\neven months since you've used it,\nand it may be way out of date.\n\n1042\n00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,560\nAnd if it's software that\nruns in the background,\n\n1043\n00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,636\nthen you are putting yourself at risk, so\nyou gotta make sure you do those updates.\n\n1044\n00:51:25,636 --> 00:51:28,800\nAnother example would be, like, VLC.\n\n1045\n00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,090\nVLC is a video player that I use for\n\n1046\n00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,590\ntesting, and if I fire it up, it does\nlittle checks every now and then too,\n\n1047\n00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,880\nbut if I wanna force it,\nI can go up here to my menu and\n\n1048\n00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,430\nchoose Check For Updates and it'll\nreach out and look, and I'm up to date.\n\n1049\n00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:49,760\nI'm running the newest one, and there we\ngo, but that's just a check right now.\n\n1050\n00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,690\nIt's a good idea to go into\nthe preferences for that app and in here\n\n1051\n00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,090\nyou can tell it to automatically check for\nupdates, it's buried in here somewhere.\n\n1052\n00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:02,852\n>> Down toward the bottom right above,\nyeah, your right, CTB, yep, go down.\n\n1053\n00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:05,180\n>> Oh, here, automatically check for\nupdates which I don't have checked so\n\n1054\n00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,360\nI'm going to go ahead and check that, and\n\n1055\n00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,580\nthat way it'll let me know\nwhen there's updates.\n\n1056\n00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,260\nIt's a good idea to do that, or\n\n1057\n00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,060\nif you're not going to be using it\nregularly, you can uninstall that.\n\n1058\n00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,420\nYou can remove the software\nin order to do that.\n\n1059\n00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,320\nNow where this becomes even\nmore challenging are drivers,\n\n1060\n00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,910\nbecause you don't run drivers, right?\n\n1061\n00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,840\nSo if I install a new video card\ndriver and a update comes up for it,\n\n1062\n00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,180\nhow do I know?\n\n1063\n00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,190\nWell some vendors like Nvidia\nbrought up their video card site.\n\n1064\n00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,980\nThey have this little application you run,\nthey call it,\n\n1065\n00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,100\nI think it's GeForce Experience or\nsomething like that, Nvidia Experience?\n\n1066\n00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,650\nI dunno, something, but\nit'll notify you about new driver updates.\n\n1067\n00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,380\nBut I get really frustrated with\nit because it's a heavy program,\n\n1068\n00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,530\nit consumes a lot of resources, so\nyou may not want to go that route.\n\n1069\n00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,172\nIf you disable that software notification,\nthough, you need to do a regular check\n\n1070\n00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:53,724\nperiodically to see if there have been\nupdates to the drivers, it is important.\n\n1071\n00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:55,200\nAll right, so Ronny,\n\n1072\n00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,484\nI think we've exhausted all that\nwe can talk about with updates.\n\n1073\n00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:01,888\nCan you think of anything\nelse worth mentioning?\n\n1074\n00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,330\n>> No, not really.\n\n1075\n00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,600\nMake sure that our applications are up\nto date as well as our operating system,\n\n1076\n00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,039\nthose are two key best practices for\nanybody using a computer.\n\n1077\n00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,166\nAnd if you're going to be\nan IT Pro in the IT field,\n\n1078\n00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,857\nthese are things that we should remember.\n\n1079\n00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:20,453\nSo being able to know where they're\nlocated, being able to make sure that\n\n1080\n00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:24,060\nour computers are updated, kind of\nimportant for everything that we do.\n\n1081\n00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,660\n>> All right.\nWell, we still have more to cover, but\n\n1082\n00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,670\nwe're out of time in this segment, so\nwe're gonna stop here and take a break.\n\n1083\n00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,703\nWhen we get back, we're going to talk\na little bit about software licensing, and\n\n1084\n00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:37,750\nwe'll talk a bit about compatibility and\nversion tracking.\n\n1085\n00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,787\nSo we'll get a chance to see all that,\ncoming up.\n\n1086\n00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:40,292\nStay tuned.\n\n1087\n00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:50,292\n[MUSIC]\n\n1088\n00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:59,723\nOne important thing to know is what\nversion you're currently running.\n\n1089\n00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:02,738\nA lot of software will send me an email\nand it'll say, the developer will send me\n\n1090\n00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:05,938\nan email and say, hey new version is out,\nhere's some new features, check it out.\n\n1091\n00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,764\nAll right, it's part of their update and\nmarketing campaign.\n\n1092\n00:54:08,764 --> 00:54:13,083\nAnd when you look at it, you might say,\nwell, am I already at that version or\n\n1093\n00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,380\ndoes this apply to me.\n\n1094\n00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,050\nOr maybe, you're talking to tech support\nfor some help and they say, all right,\n\n1095\n00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,575\nwhat version of our\nsoftware are you running?\n\n1096\n00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:21,843\nSo, it's important to understand\nhow to determine that.\n\n1097\n00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:24,897\nLet me start on the Mac and\nthen we'll switch over to Windows so\n\n1098\n00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:26,590\nRonnie can show it there.\n\n1099\n00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,830\nOn a Mac, if we want to find out\nwhat version of the operating\n\n1100\n00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,890\nsystem we're running, it's pretty easy,\nwe've got an Apple menu up here.\n\n1101\n00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,960\nAnd we can hit that Apple menu,\nand you'll see About This Mac, and\n\n1102\n00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,010\nit's on that screen that you'll see what\nversion of the software you're running.\n\n1103\n00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:45,340\nYou can see I'm running version 10.10, so\nthat's the version of my operating system.\n\n1104\n00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,576\nBut for my individual applications,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n1105\n00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,406\nThere's actually two different ways we can\nfind the version number of an application.\n\n1106\n00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:57,150\nOne of the easiest ways is to\njust launch the application.\n\n1107\n00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,940\nSo if I take something like we've\nbeen doing what, FileZilla?\n\n1108\n00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,390\nActually, let me use VLC,\nthat was one that we looked at earlier.\n\n1109\n00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,450\nSo if I take VLC here as an example,\nwhen you launch it,\n\n1110\n00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,280\nyou'll have an application menu and\nunder that application menu,\n\n1111\n00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,270\nit's just whatever name that program is,\nyou'll have About.\n\n1112\n00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,910\nAnd so I've got it right there,\nAbout VLC Media Player.\n\n1113\n00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,690\nI can chose that, and\nit tells me i'm running 2.1.5.\n\n1114\n00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,630\nAll right, now, if the problem is that our\nprogram is not even running, it's just\n\n1115\n00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,620\ncrashing when you launch it and that's why\nyou're on the phone with tech support,\n\n1116\n00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,890\nthis menu doesn't help you much, right?\n\n1117\n00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:34,090\nSo, the version number is actually\nembedded in the application itself.\n\n1118\n00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:38,620\nIf you browse into your Applications\nfolder and you find it in there, so\n\n1119\n00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,550\nI'll just find VLC if I can\nremember my alphabet, there it is.\n\n1120\n00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:48,340\nAnd you can, cmd-i is what I normally do,\nor if you shift-click on it and\n\n1121\n00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,510\ngo to Get Info it's the same thing,\ncmd-i just goes straight to the screen.\n\n1122\n00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,239\nYou'll see the details about the file, and\n\n1123\n00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,536\nhidden away here in the details\nis the version number, 2.1.5.\n\n1124\n00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:02,356\nSo you can gain access to that without\nactually installing the software.\n\n1125\n00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:05,230\nAll right, pretty straightforward.\n\n1126\n00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,550\nEasy to figure out what\nversion we're running.\n\n1127\n00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,274\nAll right, now, it is different\nin Windows though, right, Ronnie?\n\n1128\n00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:14,421\n>> On my computer, I'm running\nFileZilla and inside of that FileZilla,\n\n1129\n00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:18,764\nonce it's opened up, right\n>> I'm gonna go to the Help link and\n\n1130\n00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:22,120\ninside of Help, I can go to About.\n\n1131\n00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,716\nAnd it is here, right at the top,\n\n1132\n00:56:23,716 --> 00:56:27,027\nwe can see that version number when\nwe're running inside that file.\n\n1133\n00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:32,606\nSo once we have that information,\nit always works unless you're doing what\n\n1134\n00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:38,807\nDon said, which is I can't even get access\nto the, inside of the Filezilla itself.\n\n1135\n00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:41,314\nSo I can simply close out of Filezilla and\n\n1136\n00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:45,754\ninside of Filezilla, let me close out and\nbe able to get access into it.\n\n1137\n00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:50,858\nSo I just clicked on the File Explorer and\nI'm going to my hard drive,\n\n1138\n00:56:50,858 --> 00:56:57,117\nlocal disk C and the Program Files (x86)\nand there's the subfolder FileZilla.\n\n1139\n00:56:57,117 --> 00:57:02,858\nOn the EXE on the executable file,\nif I right-click and go to Properties,\n\n1140\n00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:07,234\nI have on the Details tab,\nthe same file version number,\n\n1141\n00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:11,063\nwhich tells me that's also\nthe name of the file and\n\n1142\n00:57:11,063 --> 00:57:14,919\nthe product that the support\nis gonna wanna have.\n\n1143\n00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:18,263\n>> Yeah, this is a great way to find that\nversion number without actually launching\n\n1144\n00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:19,056\nthe application.\n\n1145\n00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:21,638\nI do want to give you one\nword of caution though, and\n\n1146\n00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,755\nthis is the same on Mac\nas it is in Windows.\n\n1147\n00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:27,069\nWhen a developer compiles a new version,\nwhen they put out an update,\n\n1148\n00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:30,233\nthey always remember to go and\nupdate their About screen, right?\n\n1149\n00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:31,505\nThat's where they show that off.\n\n1150\n00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:34,471\nSometimes, they forget to\nupdate the file header.\n\n1151\n00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:37,884\nSo I have seen where the numbers\ndon't match, that shouldn't happen.\n\n1152\n00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:41,274\nNormally, they should be in sync, but\nthey are set in two separate places.\n\n1153\n00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:44,356\nSo it is possible for a developer to\nmix that up, so you might actually\n\n1154\n00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:47,509\nsee different version numbers between\nthe application and the file.\n\n1155\n00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,413\nBut if you can't run the application,\nyou don't have much choice,\n\n1156\n00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:53,430\nyou've got to go by the file version\nnumber and this is where you see it.\n\n1157\n00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,631\nNotice that there's a lot of other files\nfor Filezilla in that directory, but\n\n1158\n00:57:57,631 --> 00:57:59,615\nRonnie picked the main executable.\n\n1159\n00:57:59,615 --> 00:58:01,525\nThat's the important part, right?\n\n1160\n00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:03,115\nGo where they actually run the program.\n\n1161\n00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:07,973\nThe other files will have different\nversions based on whatever it is they came\n\n1162\n00:58:07,973 --> 00:58:08,505\nout of.\n\n1163\n00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:09,381\nAll right.\n\n1164\n00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:13,172\nNow when we run an application,\nhopefully it runs just great for us.\n\n1165\n00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:16,577\nBut new versions of Windows come out and\noccasionally,\n\n1166\n00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:19,918\nyou'll have where an application\nwont work anymore.\n\n1167\n00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:24,028\nIt might have worked fine under Windows 7\nand now it doesn't work under Windows 8.\n\n1168\n00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:24,562\n>> Right.\n\n1169\n00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:27,134\n>> Now in the Mac world, it happens too.\n\n1170\n00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:28,586\nMaybe you're running Mavericks and\n\n1171\n00:58:28,586 --> 00:58:30,605\nyou update to Yosemite and\nan application breaks.\n\n1172\n00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:33,733\nWell, Apple doesn't really deal\nwith backwards compatibility.\n\n1173\n00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:36,918\nI shouldn't say, they sort of don't,\nthey really don't,\n\n1174\n00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:39,806\nthey just do not worry about\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n1175\n00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:43,692\nAnd so applications frequently break\nwhen you update to newer versions and\n\n1176\n00:58:43,692 --> 00:58:45,726\nit's up to the developers to fix that,\n\n1177\n00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:48,576\nfix the application and\nget them working on the new OS.\n\n1178\n00:58:48,576 --> 00:58:53,370\nSo in the Mac world, you just have\nto wait for the developers fix it.\n\n1179\n00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:54,673\nOn the Windows side though,\n\n1180\n00:58:54,673 --> 00:58:57,566\nMicrosoft is very concerned\nabout their business customers.\n\n1181\n00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:01,329\nAnd they wanna ensure that their business\ncustomers can go to the newer versions of\n\n1182\n00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,703\nWindows as soon as possible.\n\n1183\n00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:05,186\nSo if we have an issue with\nan application running,\n\n1184\n00:59:05,186 --> 00:59:07,799\nwe don't necessarily have\nto wait on the developer.\n\n1185\n00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:11,677\nThere's a whole suite of compatibility\ntools that Microsoft includes that we\n\n1186\n00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:14,275\ncan use to help get our\napplications running again.\n\n1187\n00:59:14,275 --> 00:59:16,070\nRonnie, let's take a look\nat that on your machine.\n\n1188\n00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:19,143\n>> Sure.\nOn FileZilla, on the executable again,\n\n1189\n00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:22,114\nI right-clicked and\nwent to the Properties and\n\n1190\n00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:24,798\nnotice that there is a Compatibility tab.\n\n1191\n00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:29,922\nAnd this is what will trick FileZilla\ninto believing that it's actually\n\n1192\n00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:34,627\ngonna be installed on another\noperating system on an earlier one.\n\n1193\n00:59:34,627 --> 00:59:38,200\nSo I have compatibility mode\nin which if I go ahead and\n\n1194\n00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,194\nput a check box here and\nthen I can click on the drop-down.\n\n1195\n00:59:42,194 --> 00:59:45,410\nNotice I can go,\nit looks like backward compatible back to-\n\n1196\n00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:45,944\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1197\n00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:47,239\n>> Windows 95 or ME,\n\n1198\n00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:51,595\nif I happen to be running that program\nall the way back to that point.\n\n1199\n00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:54,329\nI doubt that would happen,\nbut I guess it's possible.\n\n1200\n00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:58,268\nMore likely, the more popular one is\nprobably gonna be this Windows XP with\n\n1201\n00:59:58,268 --> 00:59:59,457\nservices pack three or\n\n1202\n00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:02,662\nservice pack two is what we tend\nsee to be able to change that.\n\n1203\n01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:03,618\nAnd then of course,\n\n1204\n01:00:03,618 --> 01:00:07,630\nsettings that would be more congruent with\nthose operating systems in the display.\n\n1205\n01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:09,984\n>> Yeah, so\nsome of these are advanced settings, but\n\n1206\n01:00:09,984 --> 01:00:12,352\nat a minimum the operating\nsystem selector there.\n\n1207\n01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:16,682\nIt just basically triggers the application\nto thinking it's running under the older\n\n1208\n01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:20,070\nOS and often times,\nthe application will still work just fine.\n\n1209\n01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,935\nSo you're not kind of at\nthe mercy of the developers and\n\n1210\n01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:26,436\nthat's because of Microsoft's\nfocus on that business support.\n\n1211\n01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:30,672\nWith businesses, a lot of times, they'll\nget custom applications developed and\n\n1212\n01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:33,042\ndoing the updates is costly and\nit takes time.\n\n1213\n01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:36,498\nSo they don't want that to be\nan obstacle between you and updating, so\n\n1214\n01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:39,559\nthat's why they provide that and\nit kind of helps both sides.\n\n1215\n01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:42,346\nSo it's a neat feature and\nits built by the DLS.\n\n1216\n01:00:42,346 --> 01:00:43,983\nAll right.\n\n1217\n01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:47,820\nNow the last thing that we need to talk\nabout in this objective is licensing.\n\n1218\n01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,710\nWhen you buy an operating system and\nwhen you buy applications,\n\n1219\n01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,815\nthere's typically a license\nassociated to them.\n\n1220\n01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:55,349\nAll right.\n\n1221\n01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:58,610\nWhen you buy software,\nif there was no licensing protection it,\n\n1222\n01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:02,065\nthen you could just copy it and\ngive it to as many people as you wanted.\n\n1223\n01:01:02,065 --> 01:01:03,639\nYou're breaking the law, right?\n\n1224\n01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:06,207\nYou're distributing software,\nyou're not supposed to do that, but\n\n1225\n01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,588\nthere's not anything stopping you.\n\n1226\n01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:09,794\nSo most software will at a minimum,\n\n1227\n01:01:09,794 --> 01:01:13,479\nrequire a license key to be\nable to track activation usage.\n\n1228\n01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:15,573\nSo when you install a program,\n\n1229\n01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:19,613\na lot of what we've used here\nin the show was free software.\n\n1230\n01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,782\nIt didn't cost any money and so\nyou just install it and you go.\n\n1231\n01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:27,903\nBut if it's pay software, when you install\nit, it's gonna ask you for a product key.\n\n1232\n01:01:27,903 --> 01:01:31,409\nYou have to put in your license number,\nright?\n\n1233\n01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:35,433\nNow when you buy that product, you pay\nthe money on their website or where ever.\n\n1234\n01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:38,800\nThey send you the license key and\nyour able to use that.\n\n1235\n01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,696\nNow license key is gonna look like\nall sorts of different things.\n\n1236\n01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:43,728\nI've got,\nlet me see if I can find it here.\n\n1237\n01:01:43,728 --> 01:01:45,539\nI've got some example\nones here from Microsoft.\n\n1238\n01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,408\nMicrosoft puts out fake\nproduct key numbers for\n\n1239\n01:01:48,408 --> 01:01:52,006\nyou to use to do simple machine\ninstalls for distribution.\n\n1240\n01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:56,095\nThese aren't real keys, but\nthey'll show you what they look like and\n\n1241\n01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,133\nyou'll see here, they're 25\ncharacters separated by hyphens.\n\n1242\n01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,951\nThis is a big long number or\nletter combination and\n\n1243\n01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:06,651\nit's up to the software developer\nhow they want that model to be.\n\n1244\n01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:07,899\nIt could be very long.\n\n1245\n01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:09,036\nIt could be very short.\n\n1246\n01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:11,198\nWith Microsoft,\nthey just care about the code.\n\n1247\n01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:13,573\nThey don't care about a name or anything.\n\n1248\n01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:16,110\nOther vendors might tie\nthis to your email address,\n\n1249\n01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,964\nyou actually need email in this code.\n\n1250\n01:02:17,964 --> 01:02:21,354\nOther vendors might have multiple\ncodes that you have to put in, so\n\n1251\n01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,302\nit varies from software to software.\n\n1252\n01:02:23,302 --> 01:02:24,225\nAll right?\n\n1253\n01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:27,697\nYou'll see, for example, I mentioned\nExpand Drive earlier in this show,\n\n1254\n01:02:27,697 --> 01:02:28,846\nthe software that I use.\n\n1255\n01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:34,068\nAnd if I, let's see, if I go into\nits Settings, you can see in here,\n\n1256\n01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:39,044\nwhere actually it's telling me,\nI need to enter my license key.\n\n1257\n01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:39,798\nAll right.\n\n1258\n01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,540\nI took my license key out from before.\n\n1259\n01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,239\nSo it's telling me,\nI've got seven days left in my free trial.\n\n1260\n01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,077\nIf I don't enter my license key,\nI'm out of luck.\n\n1261\n01:02:47,077 --> 01:02:47,733\nAll right.\n\n1262\n01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:50,189\nSo what I need to do is hit\nenter your license key and\n\n1263\n01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:52,071\nthen I can punch my key right in there.\n\n1264\n01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:54,707\nAnd when you hit Activate,\nit's phoning home to them.\n\n1265\n01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:57,089\nAnd it's saying, hey,\nthis guy just installed the software and\n\n1266\n01:02:57,089 --> 01:02:57,920\nit's using this key.\n\n1267\n01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,571\nIs it valid?\n\n1268\n01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:02,368\nAnd their servers will respond back and\nsay, yeah, it's a valid key.\n\n1269\n01:03:02,368 --> 01:03:03,400\nIt's okay, let him install.\n\n1270\n01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,124\nOr they might say, you know what?\n\n1271\n01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:07,040\nThis is their 20th install today.\n\n1272\n01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,900\nThey're obviously, bulk distributing it,\ncut them off and it won't work and\n\n1273\n01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,174\nthen we stay in demo mode.\n\n1274\n01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:12,714\nAll right.\n\n1275\n01:03:12,714 --> 01:03:14,798\nSo you do have to be careful with that.\n\n1276\n01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,956\nWhen you get a product key like this,\nyou need to not share it.\n\n1277\n01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:21,137\nYou need to protect that key and\nkeep it to yourself.\n\n1278\n01:03:21,137 --> 01:03:21,746\nAll right.\n\n1279\n01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:27,009\nBut there are corporate keys, special\nkeys that have a lot of times, they call\n\n1280\n01:03:27,009 --> 01:03:32,065\nit a site license, where it is allowed\nto be used on more than one computer.\n\n1281\n01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:33,835\nAnd Ronnie,\nyou've got some examples, right?\n\n1282\n01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:35,066\n>> Right.\nYeah, I went ahead and\n\n1283\n01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:38,432\npulled up some product keys that I have\nactually assigned to me from TechNet and\n\n1284\n01:03:38,432 --> 01:03:42,580\nI make sure I hit it, so I don't share the\nkey out with everybody on the internet.\n\n1285\n01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,618\nSo here for Windows 7 Enterprise,\nwhere you see that the term enterprise,\n\n1286\n01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:50,973\nthat's normally not gonna be distributed\nwhere somebody can walk into a store and\n\n1287\n01:03:50,973 --> 01:03:52,509\nbuy Windows 7 Enterprise.\n\n1288\n01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:57,381\nBut through a volume activation agreement,\nyou see that when I pick\n\n1289\n01:03:57,381 --> 01:04:02,096\nthat one version of Windows 7,\nit says, Multiple Activation.\n\n1290\n01:04:02,096 --> 01:04:06,897\nSo even though I had this one key\nassigned to me, actually, three keys.\n\n1291\n01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:09,550\nThis one key multiple times,\nit could be activated.\n\n1292\n01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:13,149\nNow, after you run so many times,\nit's gonna say, nope.\n\n1293\n01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,586\nYou're cut off, you don't get\nto activate that key anymore.\n\n1294\n01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:22,177\n>> But usually, that's where you can tell\nit is actually a site license key or\n\n1295\n01:04:22,177 --> 01:04:23,253\na single key.\n\n1296\n01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:27,047\nNow over on the right-hand side,\nwhen you see the term retail.\n\n1297\n01:04:27,047 --> 01:04:30,751\nUsually, this is what we're normally\ngonna do and a regular home user.\n\n1298\n01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:33,756\nOne key, one computer and\nthen when it's activated,\n\n1299\n01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:38,279\nthey're gonna actually know that's\nthe computer it's actually activated on.\n\n1300\n01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:41,612\nAnd so retail license in\nthe way that Microsoft says it\n\n1301\n01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,325\nis probably gonna be that.\n\n1302\n01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:47,728\nIt's that single use license,\nwhereas on the other side,\n\n1303\n01:04:47,728 --> 01:04:50,910\nit's multiple activations with one key.\n\n1304\n01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,000\n>> Yep.\n\n1305\n01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,793\nSo different vendors have\ndifferent support for that.\n\n1306\n01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:58,784\nOnce you activate the software, it's up\nand running and it's happy and healthy.\n\n1307\n01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:01,025\nSome of them do key to\nvarious things though, so\n\n1308\n01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:02,715\na couple of things to watch out for.\n\n1309\n01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:04,479\nWith operating system licenses,\n\n1310\n01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:08,611\nif you make a significant change to your\nhardware, like your hard drive fails and\n\n1311\n01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:11,559\nyou replace it or\na motherboard fails and you replace it.\n\n1312\n01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:14,460\nSometimes, it may view that\nit's an all new computer and\n\n1313\n01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,522\nrequires you to repeat the activation.\n\n1314\n01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:17,317\nIf the activation fails,\n\n1315\n01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,450\nyou might have to call their tech\nsupport to get it straightened out and\n\n1316\n01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,619\nyou just let them know what happened.\n\n1317\n01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,952\nYou tell them, well, I replaced my\nmotherboard and they'll say, all right.\n\n1318\n01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,440\nWell, that makes sense and\nthey'll allow it through, but\n\n1319\n01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,843\nthey'll obviously limit that.\n\n1320\n01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:30,058\nThere are only so many times,\nthey'll let that slide.\n\n1321\n01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:34,650\nAnother thing is some software that\nyou purchase will include free\n\n1322\n01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:35,962\nupdates for life.\n\n1323\n01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:39,863\nSo when a new version comes out,\nyour registration key works just fine.\n\n1324\n01:05:39,863 --> 01:05:45,509\nOther ones say, you get an update,\nbut just for this current version.\n\n1325\n01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:48,015\nSo ExpanDrive is an example of that.\n\n1326\n01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:49,813\nThat the software that\nI showed a moment ago.\n\n1327\n01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:54,278\nWith ExpanDrive,\nI bought it when it was version 3.0 and\n\n1328\n01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:56,700\nso with 3.0, I got updates.\n\n1329\n01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,698\nWhen 3.1 came out and so\non, I got those for free.\n\n1330\n01:05:59,698 --> 01:06:03,936\nBut when 4.0 came out, they said that's\na major update, you gotta pay again.\n\n1331\n01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:07,291\nI know a lot of people get\nreally frustrated with this, but\n\n1332\n01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:11,469\nthey do offe a discounted fee and so\nI paid the discounted renewal rate and\n\n1333\n01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:12,448\nI got my new key.\n\n1334\n01:06:12,448 --> 01:06:16,092\nAnd so, I just punched that in and\nnow I got registered to Down Pruset.\n\n1335\n01:06:16,092 --> 01:06:22,069\nSo I'm activated and I'm ready to go, but\nI have a new key for the new version.\n\n1336\n01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:25,169\nSo these are things that you\nmight need to keep updated.\n\n1337\n01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:27,841\nWith the Windows operating system keys,\nthe more you use them,\n\n1338\n01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:30,277\nyou'll have to buy new ones to\nreplace it and continue on.\n\n1339\n01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,935\nYou're buying licenses for\nthe computers to used.\n\n1340\n01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:35,513\nSometimes, these keys\nare non-transferable.\n\n1341\n01:06:35,513 --> 01:06:38,822\nYou install it on one computer and\nit's tied to that one computer and\n\n1342\n01:06:38,822 --> 01:06:39,933\nthat's the end of it.\n\n1343\n01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:43,633\nOther times, their highly transferable,\nthey don't even do a license check.\n\n1344\n01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:46,764\nYou can run it wherever you want and\nit's on an honor system.\n\n1345\n01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:49,164\nSome systems don't even\nhave a license check.\n\n1346\n01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:50,628\nMac OS is an example of that.\n\n1347\n01:06:50,628 --> 01:06:52,845\nThere's no Mac OS product key.\n\n1348\n01:06:52,845 --> 01:06:55,352\nBecause Mac OS will only\nrun on Apple hardware, so\n\n1349\n01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:59,070\nthey know that you bought Apple hardware\nand that's all they care about.\n\n1350\n01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:02,222\nYou can get it to work on non-Apple\nhardware if you really try, but\n\n1351\n01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:03,587\nit's really kind of thing.\n\n1352\n01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:06,159\nNow-\n>> Speaking of that transference, we have\n\n1353\n01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,854\nthat one program called SimpleDiagrams\nthat we use, which only really allows us,\n\n1354\n01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:12,674\nwith that one key,\nto be installed on three devices, is that?\n\n1355\n01:07:12,674 --> 01:07:13,370\n>> Three devices, yep.\n\n1356\n01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,425\n>> Yeah, so\nwhat you have to do is be careful there.\n\n1357\n01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:19,644\nBecause if you go, oh, no,\nmy computer's running poorly and\n\n1358\n01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:22,883\nyou decide to go ahead and\njust wipe it clean and start all over.\n\n1359\n01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:26,598\nWell, it could be that you wiped\nout that product key activation and\n\n1360\n01:07:26,598 --> 01:07:29,807\nnow you only have two devices\nleft that you can put that on.\n\n1361\n01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:31,567\nSo do be careful on some of these.\n\n1362\n01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:36,156\nMake sure that you read the agreement\nwhen you buy that, what it has to happen.\n\n1363\n01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:40,844\nSo on that simple diagram, I think we get\na unregister it and then we can put it on\n\n1364\n01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:41,628\n>> You certainly do,\n\n1365\n01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:43,987\nlet me show you guys real quick,\nI'm glad you said that.\n\n1366\n01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:47,047\nSo this is where we have\nto document this and\n\n1367\n01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:51,637\nyou document it with your licenses,\nthis is simple diagrams and\n\n1368\n01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:56,655\nwith it we go under it's menu,\nyou'll see Register and Unregister.\n\n1369\n01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,661\nSo Register is where I put in my\nproduct key, which I've already done,\n\n1370\n01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:00,872\nit's already registered.\n\n1371\n01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:05,185\nAnd if I know I'm gonna be getting ride of\nthis computer or uninstalling, before I do\n\n1372\n01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:09,042\nthat, I need to come in here and\nunregister, which frees up that license.\n\n1373\n01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:11,626\nIf I don't do it, it's gone and\nthen if I run out licenses,\n\n1374\n01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,884\nI'm gonna have to call the tech\nsupport and say, hey, I'm sorry, guys,\n\n1375\n01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:17,095\nI accidentally burned one\nof my license's keys.\n\n1376\n01:08:17,095 --> 01:08:19,984\nI don't have that computer anymore,\ncan you reissue me a new one?\n\n1377\n01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:21,680\nThey may say yes, they may say no.\n\n1378\n01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,681\nYou need to understand what's involved\nwith managing that license key when you\n\n1379\n01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:26,701\nbuy that software.\n\n1380\n01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:30,723\n>> Yeah, misuse of these licenses is\nwhere we normally get in trouble.\n\n1381\n01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:33,506\nWhen all of a sudden,\nwe still need to activate and\n\n1382\n01:08:33,506 --> 01:08:37,286\nnow our multiple activation key is\ngone and we can't do anything and\n\n1383\n01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:40,934\nthis means that somebody's gonna\nhave to get onto a telephone and\n\n1384\n01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:45,607\nmanually talk to bur, even though that may\nwork perfectly fine, it can be slower.\n\n1385\n01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:48,514\nAnd imagine if you have to do that for\nevery single machine and\n\n1386\n01:08:48,514 --> 01:08:52,507\nyou're supporting a 100 machines,\nit's gonna get very tiring very quickly.\n\n1387\n01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:55,195\nSo making sure that you keep these keys,\n\n1388\n01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:59,953\nthe integrity of these keys is very\nimportant job for us in the IT world.\n\n1389\n01:08:59,953 --> 01:09:01,753\n>> Yeah.\n\n1390\n01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:06,234\nAnd then the last thing I want to mention\nis that, really expensive software.\n\n1391\n01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:10,145\nThe software that cost thousands of\ndollars will usually go beyond just\n\n1392\n01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:13,609\na simple key and so\nsome software uses what's called a dongle.\n\n1393\n01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:17,229\nA dongle is usually a little USB key or\nit looks like a USB key.\n\n1394\n01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:21,559\nIt's a little device, very small that you\nhave to plug into a port on your computer.\n\n1395\n01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:25,730\nAnd when you launch the software,\nit checks for the presence of that device.\n\n1396\n01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:27,787\nAnd if the device is not there,\nit won't run.\n\n1397\n01:09:27,787 --> 01:09:30,649\nThese are nice, cuz you don't\nhave to mess around with keys and\n\n1398\n01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:32,379\nif you format a computer or whatever,\n\n1399\n01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:36,074\nyou can reinstall the software as long\nas you have that device, it'll connect.\n\n1400\n01:09:36,074 --> 01:09:41,061\nBut it also eliminates software piracy,\ncuz you can't clone the device or\n\n1401\n01:09:41,061 --> 01:09:43,370\nyou can but it's a big challenge.\n\n1402\n01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,115\nSo there are some programs\nout there that do that.\n\n1403\n01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,782\nAnd if you're using software\nthat's managed by a dongle,\n\n1404\n01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:50,872\nyou gotta keep track of\nthat physical device.\n\n1405\n01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:55,548\nIf somebody steals it, that's like\nstealing thousand of dollars in some cases\n\n1406\n01:09:55,548 --> 01:09:57,730\nand it can be incredibly expensive.\n\n1407\n01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,460\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1408\n01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,076\nWell, those are our best practices for\ninstalling software, managing software and\n\n1409\n01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:05,499\nuninstalling software.\n\n1410\n01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:08,463\nThere's a lot there, obviously,\nyou can ignore all that and\n\n1411\n01:10:08,463 --> 01:10:10,010\njust do things the way you want.\n\n1412\n01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:14,713\nBut If you wanna maintain the integrity\nand stability of your operating system,\n\n1413\n01:10:14,713 --> 01:10:16,524\nthose are the best practices.\n\n1414\n01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:17,811\n>> Right.\n\n1415\n01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:18,472\n>> All right.\n\n1416\n01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:21,711\nWell, that's about it for our show\ntoday and let me just remind you guys,\n\n1417\n01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:24,024\nif you have any questions,\nplease feel free to ask.\n\n1418\n01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:26,953\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1419\n01:10:26,953 --> 01:10:29,272\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n1420\n01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:33,022\nPost your questions, we monitor and\nanswer live during the show.\n\n1421\n01:10:33,022 --> 01:10:36,888\nIf you have questions while we're off\nthe air, if you're watching this recorded,\n\n1422\n01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:37,765\nyou can still ask.\n\n1423\n01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,875\nYou just need to use our Q and A forums.\n\n1424\n01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,935\nAt the top of every page\non the ITPro TV site,\n\n1425\n01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:43,736\nyou'll see a link that says, Q and A.\n\n1426\n01:10:43,736 --> 01:10:48,307\nGo in there, post your question and\nwe monitor and answer after the show.\n\n1427\n01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:51,568\nSo either way, you’ve got a resource\navailable to get your questions\n\n1428\n01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,620\nanswered and get the information you need.\n\n1429\n01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,362\nAll right.\n\n1430\n01:10:54,362 --> 01:10:55,744\nWell, I hope you guys\nenjoyed the show today.\n\n1431\n01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,902\nSigning off for ITPro TV, I’m Don Pezet\n>> And

00:00:36,780\nAlright, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,560\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Don Pozet.\n\n6\n00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,250\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,970\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,900\n>> It is going great today it's another\nbeautiful sunny day here in Florida and\n\n9\n00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,730\nyou and I are now ready for another\nexciting episode into IT fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,610\n>> That is right, we got a,\na neat objective today.\n\n11\n00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,450\nThe, the one we're gonna be tackling\nin this episode is 1.4 identify\n\n12\n00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,400\nthe following alternative technologies and\ntheir purposes.\n\n13\n00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,340\nAnd, if you're like me,\n\n14\n00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,930\nyou're probably asking yourself,\nwhat is an alternative technology?\n\n15\n00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,655\n>> Well, we don't judge.\n\n16\n00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n17\n00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,185\nYour technologies are your own decision,\nbut,\n\n18\n00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:15,030\n[LAUGH] In this case we're just talking\nabout some of the newer things that\n\n19\n00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,180\nhave come out in the last few years\nthat haven't been generally adopted yet.\n\n20\n00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,010\nSo theres some features like Ronnie,\na mouse.\n\n21\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,690\n>> Right.\n>> If you got a new computer today and\n\n22\n00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,960\nit had a mouse attached to it, would\nyou be shocked and amazed at a mouse?\n\n23\n00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,610\n>> I would not be shocked and amazed\nany more that any computer had a mouse.\n\n24\n00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,100\nSo that is a that's a standard device.\n\n25\n00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,610\nYou know, a mouse, a touch pad,\na keyboard and so on.\n\n26\n00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,640\nBut let's use touch pads for example.\n\n27\n00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,800\nI remember the first time\nI saw a touch pad and\n\n28\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,340\nI just thought that was\nthe most awesome thing.\n\n29\n00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,710\nSomehow it magically detected your finger\nand could tell you when you're moving.\n\n30\n00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,520\nAnd you didn't have to have\na mouse it was amazing.\n\n31\n00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,600\nBack then it was\nan alternative technology.\n\n32\n00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,650\nToday, it's a given that when you buy\na laptop it will have a touchpad.\n\n33\n00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,660\nSo, that's the type of thing\nthat we're gonna look at here.\n\n34\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,740\nNot, not touchpads, but,\nnew things that have come out that\n\n35\n00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,670\nare gaining in popularity that five\nyears from now we'll joke about and\n\n36\n00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,290\neverybody will have, but\nright now it is still kind of new.\n\n37\n00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,930\nAlright, so the first one that we have in\nour list is one that we hold near and dear\n\n38\n00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,570\nhere in the studio because we use it every\nsingle day, and that's virtualization.\n\n39\n00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,540\nAlright?\n\n40\n00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,670\nNow, what the heck is virtualization?\n\n41\n00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,270\nVirtualization allows us to be able\nto do something that's really neat.\n\n43\n00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,440\nI remember the first time\nI encountered this Don,\n\n44\n00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,180\nand I was like I,\nI don't know how in the world that works.\n\n45\n00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,880\nYou and I,\nnormally when we take a computer and\n\n46\n00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,810\ntheres an operating system on it, we run\nit and we don't think anything about it.\n\n47\n00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,330\nBut the first time I saw this technology\nin which there was actually a computer\n\n48\n00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,090\nrunning on top of a computer Don,\nthat was amazing, and I was like okay,\n\n49\n00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,510\nI gotta figure out how that works.\n\n50\n00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,870\n>> Let me let me give you guys an analogy\nthat kind of describes this easily.\n\n51\n00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,890\nVirtualization is like carpooling for\na computer, alright?\n\n52\n00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,870\nI drove to work this morning\nin a car that has five seats.\n\n53\n00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,700\nAnd I was the only person in the car.\n\n54\n00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,490\nNow, if you're in Washington or\nOregon you're cringing right now,\n\n55\n00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,760\nbut that's just how it was,\nI was the only person in that car, and\n\n56\n00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,540\nthat meant that I had four\nseats that were unused.\n\n57\n00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,770\nI was only using a portion of\nthe potential of my car, and\n\n58\n00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,750\nthat's how most people's computers are.\n\n59\n00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,800\nMy laptop, right now, it's doing stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,265\nYou know, I'm sharing my screen, well,\nI guess you guys don't see that right now.\n\n61\n00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:28,860\nBut it's doing things, but it's still very\nidle I have a lot of memory I'm not using.\n\n62\n00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,500\nI have a lot of hard drive\nspace I'm not using.\n\n63\n00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,390\nI have a lot of processing\npower I'm not using.\n\n64\n00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,980\nIt's just sitting here doing some of\nthe tasks that I've asked it to do.\n\n65\n00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,050\nSo, with virtualization, we carpool.\n\n66\n00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,920\nWe say,\nlet's get some extra people in that car.\n\n67\n00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,110\nWe get more than one computer inside\nof your physical computer, and now\n\n68\n00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,760\nthey're all sharing that memory, sharing\nthat hard drive, sharing that processor.\n\n69\n00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,680\nAnd you get better utilization.\n\n70\n00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,440\nYou, you're getting your money's\nworth out of your hardware.\n\n71\n00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,520\nSo, virtualization is carpooling for\nyour computer.\n\n72\n00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,970\nNow, how does it work?\n\n73\n00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,810\nWell, normally with a computer,\nyou have an operating\n\n74\n00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,990\nsystem that's installed right in your\nhardware, just like Ronnie said.\n\n75\n00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,450\nAnd we run our applications on top of it.\n\n76\n00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,130\nI'm doing that here on my laptop where\nI've got Mac OS and on top of it,\n\n77\n00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,860\nI'm running Adobe Reader and\nyou know, let,\n\n78\n00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,410\nlet's take a look at my\ncomputer real quick.\n\n79\n00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,340\nJust to show our standard computing model.\n\n80\n00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,005\nRight?\n\n81\n00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,595\nSo here, I'm, I'm running Mac OS.\n\n82\n00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,725\nI got my crazy little icons down here and\nstuff.\n\n83\n00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:28,765\nI've got my operating system on my\nhardware, and I'm running Adobe Reader, so\n\n84\n00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:31,735\nI can view PDFs, and\nhere's my comp TA exam objectives, so\n\n85\n00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,622\nI know what to talk about in this episode.\n\n86\n00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:35,592\nThis is standard computing, right?\n\n87\n00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:39,692\nI'm using this to, to be able to\njust see my system and work with it.\n\n88\n00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:44,432\nBut, there's a lot of resources I'm not\nusing, and no one else can use them.\n\n89\n00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:45,842\nRonnie, can you use my RAM right now?\n\n90\n00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:46,666\n>> I cannot.\n\n91\n00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,266\n>> That it's locked up on my computer.\n\n92\n00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,586\nSo, that's the standard computing model.\n\n93\n00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,121\nBut virtualization, Ronnie,\n\n94\n00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,564\nyou've got a good diagram [CROSSTALK]\n>> Right\n\n95\n00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:55,195\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> On this, right?\n\n96\n00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,636\n>> Yes, so a good little comparison that\nwe can make that kind of makes it easy\n\n97\n00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:59,980\ngraphically\n>> It that,\n\n98\n00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,630\nhere's what Don is talking about right now\non his own computer that he's running.\n\n99\n00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,320\nThe hardware would represent that CPU,\nthe RAM,\n\n100\n00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,710\nthe hard drive that he was, talking about.\n\n101\n00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,310\nBut then we would normally go ahead and\nput on top of it,\n\n102\n00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,534\nwe'd install an operating system\nwhether it's the MAC OS or\n\n103\n00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:18,820\nthe Windows 8, is what I have running.\n\n104\n00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,440\nAnd then we'd have individual\napplications running, so\n\n105\n00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,910\nI just named them as A1, A2, A3.\n\n106\n00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,320\nThree applications\nrunning at the same time.\n\n107\n00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,320\nIt really is working, but remember\n\n108\n00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,460\nthat there's a lot of hardware underneath\nit that we're really not utilizing.\n\n109\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,310\nIt is just sitting idle.\n\n110\n00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,450\nAnd so even though I have\nthat physical machine and\n\n111\n00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,430\nthat's pretty much what most\nof us will end up doing,\n\n112\n00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,320\nto be able to use that hardware more\nefficiently, we can instead actually\n\n113\n00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,040\ntake a look at this second model over\nhere on the right-hand side, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,050\nAnd around the right-hand\nside the same hardware, but\n\n115\n00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,200\nthen we can install something that\ntechnically is called a hypervisor.\n\n116\n00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,820\nIt is just software that now is able to\n\n117\n00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,160\nkind of make a software version of\nthe hardware, I, I'm trying to think of\n\n118\n00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,930\na better term for it,\n>> I,\n\n119\n00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,430\nI\n>> Ya.\n\n120\n00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,420\n>> Always describe it as,\n\n121\n00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,170\nas kinda like a traffic cop, right.\n\n122\n00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,660\nOr a stoplight where basically its saying\nI'm gonna let more than one person have\n\n123\n00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,730\naccess to the hardware, but\nI don't want one person to monopolize it.\n\n124\n00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,690\nSo I'm gonna sit here a, as\nthe hypervisor, this is what I'm gonna do,\n\n125\n00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,280\nI'm gonna sit here.\n\n126\n00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,430\nAnd I'm gonna say, okay,\nyou can have access to the processor.\n\n127\n00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,260\nAlright, your turns over,\nnow it's this guys turn.\n\n128\n00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,250\nNope, your turns over,\nnow it's this other guys turn.\n\n129\n00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,590\nSo the hypervisor is what facilitates\nthe sharing of the hardware.\n\n130\n00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,200\nIt's the one that's allowing\ndifferent people to take turns.\n\n131\n00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,370\nYep.\n\n132\n00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,562\n>> And then, once we have that\nhypervisor installed, we can now,\n\n133\n00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:45,280\ngo ahead and create an environment,\na software environment that says,\n\n134\n00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,580\nyou've got access to this much RAM, you've\ngot access to this much hard drive space,\n\n135\n00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,890\nyou've got access to well,\nwhatever else it needs.\n\n136\n00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,910\nAnd in that environment,\nI can now install my own operating system.\n\n137\n00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,780\nAnd once the operating\nsystem is installed,\n\n138\n00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,180\ntreat it like a regular computer and\ninstall applications and\n\n139\n00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,670\nrun that just like a physical machine\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n140\n00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,040\nIf I'm still not using all of\nthe hardware that's available,\n\n141\n00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,870\nI can then put another operating\nsystem and do the same thing.\n\n142\n00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,360\nAnd both of them can be\nrunning simultaneously.\n\n143\n00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,880\nAnd that was the neatest\ntechnology that I've come across\n\n144\n00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,690\nwhen I first got into this.\n\n145\n00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,740\n>> Yeah, you know, on a desktop or\n\n146\n00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,180\na laptop it might only be one or\ntwo operating systems.\n\n147\n00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,040\nBut if this were a server,\nlike what you used out on the internet,\n\n148\n00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,260\nyou could have ten, 15 different operating\nsystems all running at the same time.\n\n149\n00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,680\nAnd they might not all be different.\n\n150\n00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,190\nThey might be the exact same operating\nsystem, but doing different things.\n\n151\n00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,020\nYou might have a web server,\nand an email server, and\n\n152\n00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,670\na file server all running\non the same hardware.\n\n153\n00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,920\nAnd because they're sharing that hardware,\nyou get better utilization out of it.\n\n154\n00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,924\nYou get your money's worth out of\nthe hardware versus the old model,\n\n155\n00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:57,527\nwhere you had a lot of wasted\nresources because of it, right?\n\n156\n00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:01,222\nNow as an end user there's some neat\nways that you can make use of this.\n\n157\n00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:02,439\nFor me, I, I use it.\n\n158\n00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,138\nI've actually used it\non this show already,\n\n159\n00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,264\nalthough we didn't talk\nabout at that time.\n\n160\n00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:08,145\nI'm running Mac OS.\n\n161\n00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,700\nBut a lot of times we're\ndoing shows on Windows.\n\n162\n00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,010\nSo what do i do, do i just get rid of\nmy laptop and get a different one?\n\n163\n00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,710\nI, I could.\n\n164\n00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,710\nBut i use virtualization,\n\n165\n00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,970\nto be able to run Windows on top\nof my computer at the same time.\n\n166\n00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,910\nAnd i even run Linux, and so i can balance\nbetween multiple operating systems,\n\n167\n00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,410\nlet me just show you that.\n\n168\n00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,980\nSo here i am in my,\nlet me just minimize all this junk.\n\n169\n00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,841\nSo, so here i am in my [SOUND] my,\nmy Mac OS environment.\n\n170\n00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:38,890\nAlright, so this is my actual desktop\nthat's running on, on my laptop.\n\n171\n00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,650\nAnd then, I've got a virtualization\nprogram down here called VMWare Fusion,\n\n172\n00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,570\nand it's running in the background and\nhere, I've got a Windows 7 machine.\n\n173\n00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,520\nAnd it's running, and i can work in here.\n\n174\n00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,210\nI can launch Internet Explorer, right?\n\n175\n00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,380\nA Mac doesn't haven't have\nInternet Explorer on it, so i,\n\n176\n00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,110\ni wouldn't be able to use that normally.\n\n177\n00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,270\nAnd so it's there, it's up, it's running.\n\n178\n00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,660\nAnd if I full screen it,\nlet me just take that full screen.\n\n179\n00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,590\nI can be running Windows 7 and\ni don't even see Mac OS anymore.\n\n180\n00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,520\nNow as far as I'm concerned\nI'm on a Windows computer.\n\n181\n00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,640\nSo if i have some programs that only run\nunder Windows and other programs that run\n\n182\n00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,750\nunder Mac, or Mac OS, and i wanna\nswitch back and forth, i can do it.\n\n183\n00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,380\nAnd where it gets really cool is\nwhen you have it all configured.\n\n184\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,840\nYou've got all your applications installed\nand you just quickly flip between them.\n\n185\n00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,559\nSo you'll see right here,\n\n186\n00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,532\nI've got Linux installed [SOUND]\nif i can remember my password.\n\n187\n00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:31,066\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:37,114\nSo here's Linux, here's Windows 7 and\nHere's Mac OS and now i got one laptop and\n\n189\n00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:43,060\ni can flip between these three\noperating systems in a moment's notice.\n\n190\n00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,250\nOr can put them in Windows where\ni can see them at the same time.\n\n191\n00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,840\nYou have that flexibility.\n\n192\n00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,230\nThis is great because,\nsometimes you might have old software,\n\n193\n00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,530\nthat hasn't been updated for\nnew operating systems.\n\n194\n00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,350\nMaybe you really want\nto try out Windows 10.\n\n195\n00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,820\nBut you know that you've got some\napplication that only works on Windows 7.\n\n196\n00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,520\nSo you could go ahead and\nupgrade to Windows 10 and\n\n197\n00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,070\nuse virtualization to bring up a,\nthey call it a virtual machine, but\n\n198\n00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,980\nbasically a virtual computer that is\nrunning Windows 7, running the older OS so\n\n199\n00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,730\nyou can still run the application you\nneeded for work or for whatever, alright?\n\n200\n00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,920\nThat's what virtualization does,\n\n201\n00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,450\nit's very powerful,\nmost home users have no need for it.\n\n202\n00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,920\nMost business users don't\nhave a lot of need for it.\n\n203\n00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,100\nRight now we see it in server rooms,\ndata centers.\n\n204\n00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,140\nRight?\nThat's where it's deployed very heavily\n\n205\n00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,800\nand people like me,you know that\nare doing research and development.\n\n206\n00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400\nRonnie, you, eh,\nall the guys here in the studio,\n\n207\n00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,380\nwe all run virtualization\nsoftware of one form or another.\n\n208\n00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,280\nSo, that is something\nthat is here to stay.\n\n209\n00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,380\nIt's growing in popularity.\n\n210\n00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,190\nAnd you're gonna see this in\nthe consumer market down the road.\n\n211\n00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,500\nYou'll see where you can buy a laptop and\n\n212\n00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,350\nyou can have a business virtual machine\nand a personal virtual machine.\n\n213\n00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,630\nSo if you want to play video games and\n\n214\n00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,880\nstuff you flip to the personal side and\nyou use it.\n\n215\n00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,350\nBut if you're doing work you\nflip to the business side.\n\n216\n00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,850\nAnd it's encrypted,\nhigh security, and so on.\n\n217\n00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,480\nAnd you just flip between the two.\n\n218\n00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,650\nJust one laptop, but\nit's now got two roles.\n\n219\n00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,130\nSo that's what's coming down the road.\n\n220\n00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,050\nAnd that's an alternative technology.\n\n221\n00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,770\nWhen i was first starting to get into\nthe IT industry and trying to learn these\n\n223\n00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,540\nnew operating systems,\nthis was the technology that i needed\n\n224\n00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,470\nbecause i didn't actually have the money\nto buy two or three different computers.\n\n225\n00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,020\nAnd when somebody showed me this i said,\n\"That is what i needed to know about\" so\n\n226\n00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,910\nthat i can go and\ninstall these multiple operating systems.\n\n227\n00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,120\nAnd just to be able to,\nto switch between them and\n\n228\n00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080\nnot have to worry about\nbuying new hardware.\n\n229\n00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,880\nSo that's where that cost\nsavings also comes in and\n\n230\n00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,420\nbeing able to use that hardware more\neffectively is pretty much a key.\n\n231\n00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,410\n>> Ya, and if you wanna get your\nfeet wet with virtualization\n\n232\n00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,400\nthere's various products\nthat are out there.\n\n233\n00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,370\nI use VMR fusion but it is not free.\n\n234\n00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,870\nThe basic version of it, i think,\nis like $80 or something so\n\n235\n00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,060\nit does cost some money.\n\n236\n00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,520\nBut if you just want to\nget our feet with it,\n\n237\n00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,760\nthere's some great free\nproducts out there.\n\n238\n00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,980\nAnd the one we recommend.\n\n239\n00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,340\nAnd actually i even use it a lot of times,\n\n240\n00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,500\neven though i have this\nother paid software.\n\n241\n00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,850\nThere's a product called VirtualBox.\n\n242\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,070\nIt's from Oracle.\n\n243\n00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,600\nAnd it's completely free.\n\n244\n00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680\nYou can download and install it.\n\n245\n00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,670\nIt'll allow you to bring\nvirtual machines up and\n\n246\n00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,180\nmess around with all sorts of different\nstuff It runs on top of Windows,\n\n247\n00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,530\nit runs on top of Linux,\nand on top of Mac OS.\n\n248\n00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,310\nSo, regardless of what your platform is,\nyou can use VirtualBox and\n\n249\n00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,290\nthey start bringing up virtual machines.\n\n250\n00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,060\nThe websites just virtualbox.org and\nthe software is free.\n\n251\n00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,290\nSo, you know, just give it a shot if it's\nsomething you want to learn more about.\n\n252\n00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,340\n>> Yeah, this is my favorite\nplatform that i end up using.\n\n253\n00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,460\nIt's very easy, very user friendly.\n\n254\n00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,140\nYou don't have to learn a lot.\n\n255\n00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,820\nAll you have to do is click on that\nnew button and follow directions.\n\n256\n00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,780\nSo, i like it.\n\n257\n00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,840\nNow, the only drawback that we\nhave if you're going to say; hey,\n\n258\n00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,110\nthis is what i want to do,\nis the operating systems.\n\n259\n00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,650\nYou do have to have a licensed\ncopy of that operating system.\n\n260\n00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,200\nYou can't just go let me, let me just\npull a copy down and install it,\n\n261\n00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,890\nand even though you might get a trial\nperiod, after that trial period you're\n\n262\n00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,470\ngonna have to reinstall it again and\nreinstall it again, so if you want to use\n\n263\n00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,650\nit full time you're gonna have to activate\nit which means a licensed product.\n\n264\n00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,690\n>> Yeah, and you'll find, like with Linux,\nmost of those are free, so\n\n265\n00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,300\nif you don't require\na license you can do Linux.\n\n266\n00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,730\nMac OS,\n\n267\n00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,320\nApple will not let you virtualize Mac OS\nunless you're running on a Mac itself.\n\n268\n00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,750\nSo if you don't have Mac hardware\nyou can't virtualize that one.\n\n269\n00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,620\nSo that, that's kind of a limitation for\nany virtualization software.\n\n270\n00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,580\nBut on the Windows side they do have\nplenty of free trials that are posted on\n\n271\n00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,080\ntheir site.\n\n272\n00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,470\nI think,\ndo they still do the 180 day ones?\n\n273\n00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,250\n>> On the server.\n\n274\n00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,548\n>> On the server end of it.\n\n275\n00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,442\nOn desktop i think it's a little shorter.\n\n276\n00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:24,255\n>> 30 days.\n\n277\n00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:24,940\n>> Is it just 30?\n\n278\n00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,008\n>> It is.\n\n279\n00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,372\n>> So, you can bring up a [LAUGH]\nWindows machine for 30 days, and\n\n280\n00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,100\nat the end of 30 days,\nyou just delete it and create a new one.\n\n281\n00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,580\nAnd so you can experiment and learn, and,\nand not necessarily have to buy a license,\n\n282\n00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,650\nbut you're having to destroy it every so\noften.\n\n283\n00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,400\nIf you want a long running virtual\nmachine you will need to license it.\n\n284\n00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,450\nAll right so that is virtualization and\n\n285\n00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,640\nclosely related to it is\nthe the idea of cloud computing.\n\n286\n00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,160\nAnd you know, before i do that we've\ngot a question in the chat room there.\n\n287\n00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,927\nWhat's the difference between\nVM fusion and work station.\n\n288\n00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:59,880\nSo VMWare work station is their\nproduct that they sell for Windows.\n\n289\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,520\nSo if your host operating system,\n\n290\n00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,410\nthe one running on your Windows\nthey have VMWare work station.\n\n291\n00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,530\nAnd, if your host operating system is\nMac OS, they have VMWare Fusion, alright.\n\n292\n00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,380\nSo it, it's what you're running on\nyour actual hardware that's gonna\n\n293\n00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,320\ndetermine which of those\ntwo product that you buy.\n\n294\n00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,040\nWe'll say that, VMWare has done\na great job of making VMWare Fusion,\n\n295\n00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,660\nthe Mac product, really easy to use,\nreally powerful.\n\n296\n00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,910\nThe VMWare work station on Windows,\nit's not as easy to use.\n\n297\n00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,950\nBut its got a ton more features in it and\nit's very powerful.\n\n298\n00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,370\nSo if you're a power user, the VMWare\nwork station is a lot more advanced.\n\n299\n00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,270\nThe VM Ware Fusion is a lot easier.\n\n300\n00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,197\nBut most of the time, it's just going to\ncome down to your host [INAUDIBLE] that\n\n301\n00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:43,520\ndetermines which one you go with.\n\n302\n00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,580\nYep, yeah, yep.\n\n303\n00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,436\nAll right, so\n[SOUND] good question out there.\n\n304\n00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:49,286\nThank you guys.\n\n305\n00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,410\nSo that's about it for virtualization.\n\n306\n00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,220\nRelated to that we have our\ncloud technologies, alright.\n\n307\n00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,350\nWhat, what is cloud?\n\n308\n00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,060\nWell, in our traditional computing model,\nall of our applications and\n\n309\n00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,830\nall of our data is stored\nright here on our computer.\n\n310\n00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,740\nWhat happens if your computer gets stolen?\n\n311\n00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,430\nOr what happens if your hard drive fails,\nalright?\n\n312\n00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,130\n>> You lose it.\n\n313\n00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,490\n>> You lose your data.\n\n314\n00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,240\nAnd it happens to everybody sooner or\nlater.\n\n315\n00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,390\nRonnie, have you ever had that\nsinking feeling of my data is gone.\n\n316\n00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,890\n>> I have.\n\n317\n00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,150\nYeah, i start hearing\nthat hard drive clicking.\n\n318\n00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,590\nI think, well, it can last a few more\ndays, i don't have to worry about it.\n\n319\n00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,210\none day you turn the machine on and\nit no longer actually even works.\n\n320\n00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,500\nOkay, so\nnow you get another hard drive and\n\n321\n00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,770\ngo maybe i can still access the data and\nit's not there anymore.\n\n322\n00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,760\nIt is the worst feeling in the world\nespecially if you thought that that data\n\n323\n00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,780\nwas safe and secure on your own machines.\n\n324\n00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,260\n>> So imagine if it was your family\nphotos that you've been taking for\n\n325\n00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,820\n20 years\n>> And now their just gone.\n\n326\n00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,680\nRight?\nThat's stuff that can't be replaced.\n\n327\n00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,430\nYou can't,\nyou can't recreate that ya know.\n\n328\n00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,930\nThose, those times are gone.\n\n329\n00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,980\nSo, we need our data to be safe,\nand always available.\n\n330\n00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,086\nAvailable even if our computer fails, even\nif we lose our computer, or it's stolen.\n\n331\n00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:08,395\nOr, if were just traveling, and\nwe don't have our computer with us right?\n\n332\n00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,746\nWe, we need that access to our data.\n\n333\n00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:13,316\nAnd cloud computing facilitates that.\n\n334\n00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:16,164\nWhat it does is it lets you take your\ninformation and instead of storing it\n\n335\n00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:19,930\nright here on your machine, you store it\non servers that are out on the internet.\n\n336\n00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,970\nAnd the reason I say this is related\nto virtualization is the servers out on\n\n337\n00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,750\nthe internet are hosted by companies\nlike Amazon and Microsoft and\n\n338\n00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,420\nother guys where they're\ndoing virtualization.\n\n339\n00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,480\nThey're creating all these virtual servers\nto be able to manage the customer data.\n\n340\n00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,080\nSo cloud computing like this really\ndoes make our data safer as far as loss.\n\n341\n00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,783\nNow in exchange for that you're\ngiving up a little bit of privacy.\n\n342\n00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:46,322\nInstead of storing your own data\nsecurely on your own systems,\n\n343\n00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,277\nnow you're trusting somebody\nelse with that data.\n\n344\n00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:53,444\nAnd I don't know how it is in other\ncountries, but in the United States,\n\n345\n00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:57,910\nthe U.S. government has shown repeatedly\nthat they will access that data.\n\n346\n00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,800\nSo you, when you move the data out there,\nit is safer and more protected, but\n\n347\n00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,880\nnow you've got, law enforcement,\nother people that,\n\n348\n00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,110\nthat would be able to reach in and\nget that data.\n\n349\n00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,210\nThere's different arguments about it,\n\n350\n00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,560\nI don't want to get into the political\nside of the, the whole mess, but but, but\n\n351\n00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,050\nwe use it religiously here.\n\n352\n00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,810\nWhen we first founded ITPro TV and\nwe started with all of our show notes and\n\n353\n00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,240\nall of that, I said, we've gotta have\na way to make sure our data is backed up.\n\n354\n00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,110\nIf this building were to lose power,\n\n355\n00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,800\nour customers still need to\nbe able to watch our shows.\n\n356\n00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,080\nAnd if I have multiple hosts on\na show like Ronnie and I, Ronnie, we,\n\n357\n00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,780\nwe need a way to coordinate our show\nnotes so we know what to talk about.\n\n358\n00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,050\nAnd we can't do that if it's\nall on my laptop, right.\n\n359\n00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,070\nSo we went with cloud services.\n\n360\n00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,620\nFor our documents we went with Google\nback then it was called Google Docs.\n\n361\n00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,210\nNow it's Google Apps for Work.\n\n362\n00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,260\nAnd so all of our, our work documents and\nour show notes, it's all stored in,\n\n363\n00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,340\nin Google Apps.\n\n364\n00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,220\nAnd so that we can all get access to it,\nand we don't have to worry if we lose\n\n365\n00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,364\na laptop or get a new computer,\nthe data is just available.\n\n366\n00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:00,677\n>> On a lot of the newer operating\nsystems, like Windows 8.1,\n\n367\n00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,988\nthey really want you to use it so\nmuch that when you go ahead and,\n\n368\n00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:06,631\nthe first time you install\nthe operating system.\n\n369\n00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,280\nYou end up signing up for an,\nan account online and that even, at times,\n\n370\n00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,215\ngives you access to, well, cloud storage.\n\n371\n00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:16,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just like what Don's talking about,\n\n372\n00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,410\nautomatically.\n\n373\n00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,950\nWhen I first installed\nOffice 2013 on my laptop and\n\n374\n00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,640\nI went to save a file, it did not\nsave by default onto my computer.\n\n375\n00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,500\nIt automatically defaulted to\nthat cloud storage device,\n\n376\n00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,875\nwhat then was called SkyDrive,\ntoday is called OneDrive.\n\n377\n00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n378\n00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,460\nthat as long I save it, it's actually\ngetting saved up there in the cloud.\n\n379\n00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,962\nThen on any machine that I go to,\nI can hook in and\n\n380\n00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:41,281\nI can use my Microsoft account,\nopen that product backup, and\n\n381\n00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:44,115\nI can still pull my file back\nout directly from there.\n\n382\n00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:44,716\nIt's neat.\n\n383\n00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:49,411\n>> Yeah, Microsoft has OneDrive, Apple has\niCloud Drive, Amazon has, I think it's\n\n384\n00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:54,149\njust called the Amazon Drive, or Cloud\nDrive, I think is what they call theirs.\n\n385\n00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,168\nYou've got Dropbox.\n\n386\n00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,060\nThere's tons of providers out there\nthat'll give you shared storage.\n\n387\n00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,440\nBut most people's first brush with,\n\n388\n00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,350\nwith cloud services are usually two other\nthings that we haven't talked about.\n\n389\n00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,960\nThe first one,\n\n390\n00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,520\nthe one that most people deal with that\nthey don't even think about is email.\n\n391\n00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,190\nAlmost everyone uses web-based email.\n\n392\n00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,940\nIt wasn't like that in the old days,\nyou know,\n\n393\n00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,620\nit used to be that we'd run\nMicrosoft Outlook, or Eudora or\n\n394\n00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,040\nMozilla Thunderbird, or some kind of\nemail client on our computer, and\n\n395\n00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,990\nit would access our remote email accounts,\nso that we could access our email, right?\n\n396\n00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,844\nAnd if you lost your computer,\nyou didn't have an email client,\n\n397\n00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,530\nyou couldn't check your email.\n\n398\n00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,600\nBut in today's world,\nmost people fire up a web browser, and\n\n399\n00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,730\nthey go to, Yahoo Mail, or Hotmail, Gmail,\n\n400\n00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,400\nwhatever web-based email service you're\nusing, and they check your email that way.\n\n401\n00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,420\nYou're using cloud computing.\n\n402\n00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,585\nYour email client is not installed\non your computer anymore.\n\n403\n00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:48,272\nIt's a webpage that you go to, and\nyour email account, and all that is stored\n\n404\n00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:52,305\nin the cloud where it's safe,\nregardless what happens to your computer.\n\n405\n00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:56,395\nSo email is usually people's first\nexposure to cloud computing.\n\n406\n00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,005\nThe other one is streaming media, aight.\n\n407\n00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:03,935\nI, I know I've mentioned in other\nshows where I have a lot of DVDs I ha,\n\n408\n00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,690\nbought a lot of movies over the years.\n\n409\n00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,730\nAnd how I converted all of them into video\nfiles that I store in a little server in\n\n410\n00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,260\nmy house so I can stream them to the TVs.\n\n411\n00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,840\nWell, that's what people\nlike me used to do.\n\n412\n00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,930\nBut If I was starting out today all\nover again I probably wouldn't do it.\n\n413\n00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:24,580\nAnd the reason is if you sign up for\nNetflix, right, or Amazon Prime video or\n\n414\n00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,490\nHulu or the, well Redbox is shutting\ndown their video streaming.\n\n415\n00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,890\nBut, you know, any of the various video\nstreaming services that are out there,\n\n416\n00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,900\nyou have access to these\nhuge video libraries,\n\n417\n00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,520\nand you don't have to rip the videos.\n\n418\n00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,370\nYou don't have to store them.\n\n419\n00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,200\nYou don't have to worry\nabout the licensing.\n\n420\n00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,910\nAnd so, you can gain access to that and\n\n421\n00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,480\nnot have to mess with all\nthose files yourself.\n\n422\n00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,002\nAnd the same is true for audio,\nright, you've got Spotify,\n\n423\n00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:50,770\nPandora, Last.fm, the list goes on and\non, all these different services.\n\n424\n00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,738\nSo instead of ripping all of\nyour CDs that you bought, or\n\n425\n00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:58,050\neven buying the CDs in the first place,\nyou could just sign up with them, right?\n\n426\n00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,980\nPay a monthly subscription or\nwhatever they charge, and\n\n427\n00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,410\ngain access to your files that way.\n\n428\n00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,140\nNow, the music is stored in the cloud,\nnot in your machine, and\n\n429\n00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,540\nyou just stream it down,\nusing your internet.\n\n430\n00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,680\n>> The nice thing also about the cloud\nservices is being able to access it\n\n431\n00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,664\nfrom everywhere that you can.\n\n432\n00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,470\nSo as long as you have the account,\nyou can go and access it from any device,\n\n433\n00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,580\nwhether it's a regular PC workstation,\nyou know, at work,\n\n434\n00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,590\nhopefully you're probably not\ndoing the streaming over there.\n\n435\n00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,730\nBut at home or even on our handheld\nmobile devices today such as smartphones.\n\n436\n00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,620\nSo, it really does make\nit very convenient.\n\n437\n00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,460\nIt makes it redundant so that, so\n\n438\n00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,870\nthat we don't end up losing track of it or\nend up having our hard drive fail.\n\n439\n00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,070\nAnd, it's so easy with the apps that\nthey actually come out with today,\n\n440\n00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,820\nwe don't even have to learn anything\ntechnically to make it connect.\n\n441\n00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,190\nWe just need the application,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n442\n00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,350\nSo, cloud services is,\nit's not going anywhere.\n\n443\n00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,980\n>> Now let's talk about one of\nthe negatives of cloud services.\n\n444\n00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,400\nSo, I say that I, you know,\nI converted all of these video files and\n\n445\n00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,150\nI put them on a video server in my house,\nand I still use that today.\n\n446\n00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,840\nI can guarantee you that a video was\nwatched off of it in my house yesterday.\n\n447\n00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,280\nSo, why do I still have that,\nif I also have Netflix, cuz we do.\n\n448\n00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840\nAnd there's a lot of duplication\nbetween my video library and\n\n449\n00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,825\nwhat's available on Netflix.\n\n450\n00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:16,120\nWell, the reason I still have it is, a lot\nof people deal with data caps, all right.\n\n451\n00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,880\nWith my cable high speed internet,\nmy cable company has a,\n\n452\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,098\na limit of 250 gigabytes, and\nI know you're laughing right now.\n\n453\n00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:22,818\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n454\n00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:23,950\n>> What's your data cap?\n\n455\n00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,813\n>> 17 gigs.\n\n456\n00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:25,930\n>> 17, you're on satellite.\n\n457\n00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,950\n>> I am, 17 gigs.\n\n458\n00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,877\n>> Which is really low.\n\n459\n00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:31,604\nIf you have a data cap,\nwhen you're streaming video and audio,\n\n460\n00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:36,870\nthat's bandwidth you're consuming,\nand you'll eat that up pretty quickly.\n\n461\n00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,510\nI could stream from Amazon Prime Music\n\n462\n00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,380\nright to my cellphone when I'm\ndriving down the street in my car.\n\n463\n00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,180\nBut I don't do that because\non my cellular plan I've only\n\n464\n00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,350\nhave 10 gigabytes of data per month,\nright.\n\n465\n00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,570\nI don't want to eat up\nthe available bandwidth,\n\n466\n00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,720\nthey're going to charge me extra money for\nit.\n\n467\n00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640\nSo whenever I can, if I have the media\nstored locally, I'll stream it\n\n468\n00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,860\nlocally from my own computer or I'll\nstore my music on the phone itself, so\n\n469\n00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,600\nthat I don't have to worry\nabout that data plan, right?\n\n470\n00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,830\nI'd rather pay extra to\nhave some local storage.\n\n471\n00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,870\nAnd not depend on, on the the cloud\nsite so, keep that in mind as you,\n\n472\n00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,750\nas you choose these options.\n\n473\n00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,320\nPushing things to the cloud is great but\n\n474\n00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,210\nwhat if your Internet\nconnection goes down?\n\n475\n00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,580\nNow you have no access to it.\n\n476\n00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,230\nSo you might wanna do a balance and\nthat's what I do with a lot of my stuff,\n\n477\n00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,390\nI use Dropbox and Google Drive, but\nI synchronize it to local copies.\n\n478\n00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,930\nSo I have play, you know,\ndata in two places.\n\n479\n00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,410\nIf I can, I access it from the web.\n\n480\n00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,230\nBut if my internet connection is down,\nI still have my local copies I can get to.\n\n481\n00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,620\nSo always plan for\nthat kind of contingency,\n\n482\n00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,560\nyou don't want to be dependent\non the Internet connection.\n\n483\n00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,700\n>> That's a great recommendation.\n\n484\n00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:47,430\n>> All right, well Ronnie, we've got a few\nmore alternative technologies to jump into\n\n485\n00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,240\nin this episode, but this is a pretty\ngood spot to stop and take a break.\n\n486\n00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,742\nSo why don't we pause here,\nand when we get back,\n\n487\n00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:57,676\nlet's see next on our list are web\napplications, VoIP and a few other things,\n\n488\n00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,011\nso we've got a mixed bag for\nthe next segment.\n\n489\n00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:01,077\nSo stay tuned.\n\n490\n00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,436\nWe're back, after this.\n\n491\n00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:05,583\n[SOUND]\n\n492\n00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:09,990\n[SOUND].\n\n493\n00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,910\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n494\n00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,900\nSo in the second segment here we\ngot a few other little nuts and\n\n495\n00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,330\nbolts we're going to grab on for\nthe alternative technologies.\n\n496\n00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,440\nThe next one that CompTIA\ncalls out is web applications.\n\n497\n00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,380\nAnd we've sort of already\nbeen talking about these.\n\n498\n00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,100\nA web application is simply a program that\ninstead of running on your own computer,\n\n499\n00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,310\nit runs on a web server, and the web\nservers are technically, or typically,\n\n500\n00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,010\nnot in the building with you,\nalthough it could be.\n\n501\n00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,660\nThey're normally out there\non the Internet, and\n\n502\n00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,410\nso web applications have kind of\nbecome synonymous with cloud, right.\n\n503\n00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,470\nCloud access.\n\n504\n00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,428\nYour data's in the cloud.\n\n505\n00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:49,970\nYou need a way to access your data, so\nlet's put the application in the cloud,\n\n506\n00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,910\ntoo, and that's what a web application is,\nso I mentioned email clients.\n\n507\n00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,820\nWhen I wanna log into Gmail or whatever, I\ndon't fire up a client on my own computer,\n\n508\n00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,390\nI don't fire up Outlook or whatever.\n\n509\n00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,870\nI go to a webpage and I log in.\n\n510\n00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:08,490\nSo I, I brought up here just an example\nthis is Microsoft's Outlook.com service,\n\n511\n00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,040\nI, I still call it Hotmail but\nthat's not what it is anymore.\n\n512\n00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,210\nBut this is my Microsoft mailbox.\n\n513\n00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,180\nYou see how much I use it.\n\n514\n00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,050\nThe only email I got-\n>> Nice.\n\n515\n00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,070\n>> is this unusual sign\nin activity warning.\n\n516\n00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,390\nBut when I want to check my email I can\ncome in here and I can read my email,\n\n517\n00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,810\nI can respond,\ndo whatever it is that I need.\n\n518\n00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,200\nAnd I can write a new email,\nI'm going to email you Ronnie.\n\n519\n00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,710\n>> All right.\n>> Let's see, Ronnie@ITpro.tv, and\n\n520\n00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,650\nwe'll send you a message hi,\nhow are you doing?\n\n521\n00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,260\nBecause that's very important.\n\n522\n00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,300\nAnd we can send it along.\n\n523\n00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,590\nAnd let's see,\nwhere is this send button on this page?\n\n524\n00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,380\nThere it is.\n\n525\n00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,310\nSo we can send it along.\n\n526\n00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,130\n[LAUGH] And, I don't have a subject.\n\n527\n00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,630\nAw.\n>> Oh no.\n\n528\n00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,000\n>> I don't want to be one of those people.\n\n529\n00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,495\nSo, I'm gonna have, subject line.\n\n530\n00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:48,450\n[LAUGH] So\n\n531\n00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,000\nI'll send it along and, and off we go.\nThat user interface is not\n\n532\n00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600\nterribly intuitive.\n\n533\n00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,810\nSome, web applications are very intuitive,\nthat one not so much.\n\n534\n00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,980\nBut but the nice thing here is,\nI can go to 20 different computers, and\n\n535\n00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,260\nI just go to this one web page and\nlog in and there's my program.\n\n536\n00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,710\nThere's my email client with\nall my email Ready to rock.\n\n537\n00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,800\nWeb applications are really\nslick like that.\n\n538\n00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,030\n>> Yeah.\nThe, the neat thing about the way that,\n\n539\n00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,530\nthat Microsoft is trying to do this and\ntrying to get you wrapped up in their web\n\n540\n00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,900\napplication services is not\nonly with email though.\n\n541\n00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,000\nDon, if you click on that little icon\nin the upper left-hand corner, that\n\n542\n00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,020\nlittle nine dots that you see, notice that\nyou have access to everything else too.\n\n543\n00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,145\nSo even if the only thing you signed up\nfor was Outlook and a free account on\n\n544\n00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:33,940\noutlook.com you have access to these\nweb services that they provide for you.\n\n545\n00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,880\nDon has just clicked on\na spreadsheet program\n\n546\n00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,770\nthat allows him to actually be able\nto go ahead and create spreadsheets.\n\n547\n00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,480\nAnd after, yeah, right underneath the word\nbook there I was trying to make sure I was\n\n548\n00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,790\nseeing that If you wanted to create the\nwhole document up there on the cloud, and\n\n549\n00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,010\nthen he was running Excel\nin his on his own computer.\n\n550\n00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,460\nIn other words, the application on his\nown computer, it can import it down and\n\n551\n00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,380\nactually open it up even\nin his own computer.\n\n552\n00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,110\nSo, if he happens to be somewhere away and\ngoes I need to create this spreadsheet And\n\n553\n00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,080\nthen he wants to come back down and\nopen it on his own computer.\n\n554\n00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,560\nVery easily done, and so Microsoft,\nGoogle Apps now does essentiall the same.\n\n555\n00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,910\nWhere you have all these\nprograms right up there.\n\n556\n00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,640\nMakes a very handy and very much a,\na mobile platform for us to,\n\n557\n00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,870\nto build a go-to.\n\n558\n00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,860\nYeah, and it's neat.\n\n559\n00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,020\nIt's basically got the same functionality\nas the desktop application, so\n\n560\n00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,800\nsomething like Excel, where you use\nformulas and all that, you know,\n\n561\n00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,400\nI might have some fields that\ncontain values like this.\n\n562\n00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,900\nAnd I'm, I'm trying to just do,\nwhoops shoot,\n\n563\n00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,940\nI forgot something important,\nwhich is that.\n\n564\n00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,930\nSo, I might have some fields in here that,\nthat say something like,\n\n565\n00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,030\n2 plus 2 equals something, right?\n\n566\n00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,458\nAnd, and I can use a formula to calculate\nout what the answer to that math\n\n567\n00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,100\nproblem is.\n\n568\n00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,320\nAnd in the desktop application, you can\nwrite out all sorts of complex formulas,\n\n569\n00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,030\nand I can do that here too.\n\n570\n00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,266\nSo, I could say, you know this\nis going to equal, what is that?\n\n571\n00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:07,282\nLike G4 plus I4.\n\n572\n00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:08,722\nThere we go.\n\n573\n00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:11,630\nSo I'm just going to put that in there,\nand now 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\n574\n00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,677\nAnd if I go and change these values,\nand I make that a 3.\n\n575\n00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,290\nNow, 3 plus 2 equals 5.\n\n576\n00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,100\nSee how that automatically\ncalculated that?\n\n577\n00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,800\nThat's what the desktop excel does, and\nhere the web-based one is doing it too.\n\n578\n00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,620\nOne of the problems with\ndesktop based applications is,\n\n579\n00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,420\nwhat if you're not at your desktop?\n\n580\n00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,870\nWell when you install the application it\nasks for a product key, it activates,\n\n581\n00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,440\nit's tied to your hardware.\n\n582\n00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,460\nAnd so if you were to try to install\nthat software on another machine,\n\n583\n00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,040\nMicrosoft wants you to buy another copy.\n\n584\n00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,840\nGets expensive, right?\n\n585\n00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,950\nBut with a web-based application, it's not\ntied to your machine, it's tied to you.\n\n586\n00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,030\nSo no matter what computer you're on,\nyou have access to your applications.\n\n587\n00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,530\nAnd Microsoft is not\nthe only company to do this.\n\n588\n00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,185\nThere's plenty of people that do.\n\n589\n00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:55,715\nMicrosoft has their Office 365,\nall of their applications.\n\n590\n00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:59,945\nGoogle has Google Apps, its you know, word\nprocessor, spreadsheet and all of that.\n\n591\n00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:02,905\nApple has their iWork.\n\n592\n00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:05,055\nThere we go, I know I would\nremember that one sooner or later.\n\n593\n00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,825\nWhere they have all the various\nsuite software just, just like this,\n\n594\n00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:10,055\nspreadsheet and so on, all web-based.\n\n595\n00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:13,095\nThere's other companies that\nhave gotten into it also.\n\n596\n00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:17,450\nEvery year for the last eight years or,\nor whatever, my wife and I,\n\n597\n00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,680\nwhen it comes tax time, we'd go to\nIntuit and we buy TurboTax, right?\n\n598\n00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,600\nEvery year, we buy TurboTax.\n\n599\n00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,860\nAnd, wait, wait, shoot,\nI hope that's the right one.\n\n600\n00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,250\nThere's two tax programs, and I'm\npretty sure TurboTax is the one we use.\n\n601\n00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,600\nIs that Intuit?\n\n602\n00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800\nYes, good, all right.\n\n603\n00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,620\nSo, every year we go and buy it.\n\n604\n00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,380\nAnd, and what we used to do is\nwe used to go to the store and\n\n605\n00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,000\nbuy the box right off the shelf.\n\n606\n00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,360\nAnd, and we'd run that one.\n\n607\n00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,540\nBut a few years back,\nthey switched and they said,\n\n608\n00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,690\nhey, you only use this\nsoftware once a year.\n\n609\n00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,910\nThere's not a whole lot of point\ninstalling it and running it.\n\n610\n00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,220\nLet's make it web-enabled.\n\n611\n00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,070\nAnd so they put it on their sites, and\nso now instead of buying software and\n\n612\n00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,310\ninstalling it in your own machine,\nyou log into their site and\n\n613\n00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,990\nyou punch in all your tax information,\nand so on.\n\n614\n00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,810\nAnd then it files your taxes, and\nit e-files them here in the US.\n\n615\n00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,440\nSo, that's cool, right?\n\n616\n00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,570\nBut you guys kind of start to\nsee one of the negatives here.\n\n617\n00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,380\nBy running the application on the web like\nthis, I'm transmitting my data on the web.\n\n618\n00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,820\nAnd that's the negative\nside of web applications.\n\n619\n00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,680\nIf I want to keep my tax data safe,\nsecret, private, I can install the tax\n\n620\n00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,250\nsoftware on a computer that doesn't\nget plugged into the internet.\n\n621\n00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,370\nI can do my taxes and\n\n622\n00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,400\nI can file them on paper without\ntouching the internet at all.\n\n623\n00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,010\nAnd if that's, that's what you want,\nweb applications are not for you.\n\n624\n00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,410\nBut that is the trend.\n\n625\n00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,600\nAnd so many people have gone to web-based\napplications that we're starting to see\n\n626\n00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,250\nnew computers come out like the Google,\nGoogle Chromebooks.\n\n627\n00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,110\nWhere it's a laptop and\nall it has is a web browser.\n\n628\n00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,600\nYou can't install regular applications on\nit, it's just a web browser because they\n\n629\n00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,230\nknow the applications you want are, for\nthe most part, out there on the internet.\n\n630\n00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,420\nAll right.\n\n631\n00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,700\nSo, this is something that's,\nthat's not really new, but\n\n632\n00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,580\nit's been growing in popularity,\nwe're seeing it more and more and more,\n\n633\n00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,670\nand it's becoming less and less frequent\nthat when you buy something, You,\n\n634\n00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,090\nyou don't get CD that you\nhold in your hand anymore.\n\n635\n00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,580\nYou don't get software re-install.\n\n636\n00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,640\nIt's a web page that you access and\nthere is the resource.\n\n637\n00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,180\nNow, look at ITPro TV.\n\n638\n00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,050\nWell when you sign up with us,\n\n639\n00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,830\nyou get access to our videos stream\nvia our website or to your Roku.\n\n640\n00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,980\nA company like ours ten years ago,\nyou might be getting dvds in the mail.\n\n641\n00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,330\nHere's a dvd for you to watch.\n\n642\n00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,060\nTwenty years ago a VHS tape in the mail.\n\n643\n00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,310\nSo something that you have in\nyour hands to watch locally\n\n644\n00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,380\nnow streamed off the internet.\n\n645\n00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,961\nAll right,\n\n646\n00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:28,130\npeople moved these web applications to\nfacilitate rapid delivery and updates.\n\n647\n00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,030\nYou can't update a DVD once\nit's already been sent out, but\n\n648\n00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,360\nif you're accessing it via the website,\nI can update it tonight and then tomorrow\n\n649\n00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,240\nyou've got the new content automatically\nwithout you lifting a finger.\n\n650\n00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,272\nThose are the benefits of web\napplications and cloud data.\n\n651\n00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:46,794\nAll right, I'm sure we could come up with\na whole laundry list of other web-based\n\n652\n00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:50,332\napplications that are out there,\nand it ranges from video games\n\n653\n00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:55,006\nto productivity software to audio and\nvideo editors, right, pictures.\n\n654\n00:31:55,006 --> 00:32:00,004\nIf you wanted to edit a picture,\nwe used to use Adobe Photoshop or\n\n655\n00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:03,163\nPaintshop Pro, various programs like that.\n\n656\n00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:08,535\nNow, if I wanna edit a picture, I can just\nfire up Pixlr Let me pull up Pixlr here.\n\n657\n00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:12,852\nPixlr, which is a web based\nvideo editor and, and so\n\n658\n00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:18,250\nI can go into the,\nthe Pixlr editor here, or Pixlr Express.\n\n659\n00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,500\nWhich one do I want, let's do the Express.\n\n660\n00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:28,370\nSo I can go in here, and\nit is a full-on picture-editing software.\n\n661\n00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,280\nDo I have a picture or\nsomething we can edit here?\n\n662\n00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,430\nLet's edit a picture of me.\n\n663\n00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,580\nAnd that is a terrible picture of me,\nand it's is really small.\n\n664\n00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,340\nSo I can get in here, and I can start\nto edit and work with this image.\n\n665\n00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,560\nI can, I can make it larger,\n\n666\n00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,120\nwhich is really something that I probably\nneed to do here, cuz it's pretty small.\n\n667\n00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,390\nBut basically, we can get in here and\n\n668\n00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,890\nstart to manipulate this without\ninstalling the software on our own system,\n\n669\n00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,160\nand you know,\nwe can stick fancy borders on it.\n\n670\n00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,220\nOh, I definitely need fancy\nborders on this image.\n\n671\n00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,530\nAnd, let's see.\n\n672\n00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,120\nThere.\nAlright.\n\n673\n00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,280\nSo, now, boy I'm on film.\n\n674\n00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,600\nSo, you can start to edit and\n\n675\n00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,120\nyou don't need to have this\nsoftware on your own system.\n\n676\n00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,853\nReally cool stuff and you're going to save\nit to your hard drive and off you go.\n\n677\n00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:09,824\nSo we're seeing more and more of that.\n\n678\n00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:13,080\nAll right,\nthe next on on our list is VoIP.\n\n679\n00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,606\nAnd VoIP, that,\nthat stands for voice over IP.\n\n680\n00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:18,936\nAnd it just means, sending voice calls,\n\n681\n00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:24,330\nwhich are typically telephone calls via an\nIP network, normally the internet, right?\n\n682\n00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,721\nAnd Ronnie what?\nWhy would we wanna do that?\n\n683\n00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,627\n>> Yeah, it allows us to be able to use\nthe internet as our telephone system,\n\n684\n00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:32,520\ninstead of actually having\nto find a land line.\n\n685\n00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,755\nAny place where I can get\naccess to the internet.\n\n686\n00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:38,295\nI can also have my own voice\ntraffic come through and\n\n687\n00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:39,275\npick up a handset and be able to.\n\n688\n00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,185\nYou've heard of things like Vonage?\n\n689\n00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,595\nVery popular example of\nsomething like VoIP technology.\n\n690\n00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:52,435\n>> Yeah, and in the, in the old days,\nyou know just ten years ago really,\n\n691\n00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:55,055\nif you needed a phone you would get\na phone line running under your house.\n\n692\n00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,220\nAnd you'd pay a monthly fee for\nthat phone.\n\n693\n00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,930\nWell, you've got an internet\nconnection also, for internet access.\n\n694\n00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,140\nWhy not just combine the two and\neliminate the landline, right,\n\n695\n00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,400\nyou don't need that physical\nphone line anymore.\n\n696\n00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,240\nThe big problem with those physical\nlines was long distance, but\n\n697\n00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,210\nwhen you're going over the internet there\nis not long distance involved anymore.\n\n698\n00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,170\nSo, a lot of people,\n\n699\n00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,010\nespecially people that make international\ncalls love services like Vonage.\n\n700\n00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,690\nYou're making you're making your\nphone call via the internet.\n\n701\n00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,770\nNow, on a positive side,\nyou save your time and money, right?\n\n702\n00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,420\nIt's very efficient.\n\n703\n00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,680\nOn a negative side, if your internet\nconnection goes down you lose phone.\n\n704\n00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,300\nAnd in most areas if you have\na natural disaster like a hurricane,\n\n705\n00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,070\nphone service is a high priority for\n\n706\n00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,220\nthem to restore that versus internet\nservice which is a lower priority.\n\n707\n00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,370\nSo, you may be without\nphone in an emergency.\n\n708\n00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,020\nHere in the United States,\nwe have a 911 emergency service.\n\n709\n00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,080\nSo if you have an emergency, you dial 911.\n\n710\n00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,880\nWell, if you have a physical phone line,\n\n711\n00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,530\nthey know your address\nthe instant you call.\n\n712\n00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,640\nAnd if you, if you're unable to speak or\n\n713\n00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,540\nwhatever, they'll still be able to send\nemergency service to your location.\n\n714\n00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,960\nBut if you're using Voice over IP,\nbecause it goes over the internet,\n\n715\n00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,260\nthey don't know where you're calling from.\n\n716\n00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,310\nAnd so there's these additional services\ncalled E-911 that you have to do to\n\n717\n00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,670\nregister your address to your digital\nphone so they know where to find you.\n\n718\n00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,420\nBut not every service provides that,\nright?\n\n719\n00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,140\nGoogle Voice is a great example of\na massive Voice over IP provider.\n\n720\n00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,460\nTons of people use Google Hangouts and\nGoogle Voice for doing You know, VoIP\n\n721\n00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,750\ninternational calls across the internet,\nthey don't support any kind of e-911.\n\n722\n00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,370\nSo if you're using them,\nyou can't dial 911.\n\n723\n00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,270\nThat's a big deal, right?\n\n724\n00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,900\nIf you work for a, a day care or\nsomebody, you need to have that access.\n\n725\n00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,422\nMy wife and I talk about it, you know, I'm\na tech guy, I love the digital stuff and\n\n726\n00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:39,670\nVoIP but what if one day we went out to\ndinner and we had a babysitter watching\n\n727\n00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,300\nthe kids and something happened, we\nwanted that babysitter to be able to not\n\n728\n00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,040\ndial 911 and we had said, well, we,\nwe could just use our cell phones.\n\n729\n00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,270\nBut is the babysitter gonna know that?\n\n730\n00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,680\nWell, we made sure to get a VoIP\nservice that didn't need 911.\n\n731\n00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,580\nYou know, that's the kind of\n\n732\n00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,500\nstuff that you have to think about\nwhen you start replacing those.\n\n733\n00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,100\nVoIP is not going anywhere any time\nsoon it's growing in popularity.\n\n734\n00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,780\nEspecially in businesses because you can\nreally save money on the business side.\n\n735\n00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,335\nIt's, it can be a huge cost savings.\n\n736\n00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:06,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n737\n00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,670\nThe flexibility of it is also nice too.\n\n738\n00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,034\nRight now, Don, I think we can take our\nphones the ones that we have at our\n\n739\n00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:16,060\ncubicles and actually take them just\nabout anywhere in our building.\n\n740\n00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,630\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n741\n00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,870\n>> Plug them in and it doesn't\nmatter wherever it rings it's there.\n\n742\n00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,670\nYou can even take the phone home,\ncan't you.\n\n743\n00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,230\n>> Yeah.\nOur,\n\n744\n00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,070\nour physical phones that\nwe use here in the office.\n\n745\n00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,080\nThe ones that we have at all of our desks,\nthey have a VPN client on them.\n\n746\n00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,760\nAnd so that's,\nthat's a Virtual Private Network.\n\n747\n00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,050\nAnd what it allows you to do is to take\nthat phone, and you can go to a hotel,\n\n748\n00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,160\nyou can go home,\nyou can go to another building, and\n\n749\n00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,890\nwhen you plug that phone in, it will build\nan encrypted tunnel back to our office and\n\n750\n00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,780\nthe phone goes live and\nit's ready to work.\n\n751\n00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,230\nSo, if you have somebody that\nwants to work from home,\n\n752\n00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,040\nthey can just tote this phone back and\nforth.\n\n753\n00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,210\nThey can get a second phone and\nstick it out there.\n\n754\n00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,830\nSo, you have that, that flexibility.\n\n755\n00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,190\nThat's stuff that VoIP lets you have,\nthat a physical phone line doesn't.\n\n756\n00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,800\nSo, a lot of benefits for doing it, but\n\n757\n00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,840\nit does require some planning and making\nsure you that you implement it right.\n\n758\n00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,200\n>> Alright what's next we've got oh\n>> Telepresence.\n\n759\n00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,010\n>> Related to that is telepresence.\n\n760\n00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,380\nSo telepresence is simply making\nyourself visible to somebody\n\n761\n00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,790\nelse which is kind of exactly what I'm\ndoing right now Ronnie and I are live.\n\n762\n00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,660\nThis is, if you are watching us live,\nyou're seeing a webpage and\n\n763\n00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,860\nyou're seeing us.\n\n764\n00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,960\nIf you're watching on our website,\n\n765\n00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,050\nyou're seeing us within three\nseconds of what's happening.\n\n766\n00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,250\nSo you see us, you're live,\nif you type in the chatroom,\n\n767\n00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,400\nwe see it, so James was just mentioning\nabout Hotmail getting hacked.\n\n768\n00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,760\nSo you know, we see that we can interact,\nthat's telepresence.\n\n769\n00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280\nRight.\n\n770\n00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,420\nIf we're watching this recorded though,\nright,\n\n771\n00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,958\nmaybe you missed the live taping and\nso you're watching this later on.\n\n772\n00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,825\nIt's not telepresence anymore\nbecause you can't interact with us.\n\n773\n00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:48,595\nSo, telepresence is all about\nreal time communications.\n\n774\n00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,105\nWe normally call it video conferencing,\nbut\n\n775\n00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,865\nif you think about what we're\ndoing here it's not conferencing,\n\n776\n00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:57,315\nit's not like we're all sitting down and\nhaving a meeting.\n\n777\n00:37:57,315 --> 00:38:00,395\nIt's more unidirectional I suppose.\n\n778\n00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:03,075\nSo telepresence, it's a big thing.\n\n779\n00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,775\nYou can do it like we're doing,\nwhich is incredibly expensive,\n\n780\n00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:10,080\nbut there's a lot of low cost\nalternatives too like Apple FaceTime,\n\n781\n00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,560\nMicrosoft Skype,\nyou've got Google Hangouts, right.\n\n782\n00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560\nThose are all free.\n\n783\n00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,230\nAll three of those are free.\n\n784\n00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,660\nYou've got GoToMeeting, which is from\nthe guys at Citrix, a great product for\n\n785\n00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,250\nbusinesses.\n\n786\n00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,530\nIt's not free, but it's very flexible\nif you want people to be able to share\n\n787\n00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,100\ntheir desktops, to show screens,\ndo presentations and so on.\n\n788\n00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,550\nLot of neat technologies out there\nthat provide for telepresence.\n\n789\n00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,000\n>> Yeah, the nice thing about using\nthe telepresence, unlike just a regular\n\n790\n00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,720\nphone call, is the ability to see when\nyou do make some type of statement or\n\n791\n00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,460\nyou're actually asking for\nsome type of decision to be made,\n\n792\n00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,240\nyou're not just wondering if they're,\nif they're silent or not,\n\n793\n00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,320\nyou can actually see their expressions on\ntheir face, and, and it really does bring\n\n794\n00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,040\nyou into that room, through a telephone,\nor through that connection.\n\n795\n00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,310\nThe strange this is how mobile\nthese things are actually getting.\n\n796\n00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:04,320\nI saw a device, for like $2500, which is\na kind of a device that just holds an iPad\n\n797\n00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,270\nup on a stand and has two wheels and\npeople can actually roll around the room.\n\n798\n00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,430\nAnd dude, and I can't remember what\nthe name of that device is called, but it,\n\n799\n00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,590\nit's neat how you can just set somebody's\niPad up there, and then they can control\n\n800\n00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,220\nit and they can actually roll around the\nroom, and actually see what's going on,\n\n801\n00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,390\nand they are doing it all over a, some\ntype of telepresence type of connection.\n\n802\n00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,600\n>> Yeah\n>> Oh there it is.\n\n803\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,530\n>> I've got it pulled up here.\n\n804\n00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,110\nI totally wanted to buy one of these.\n\n805\n00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,730\nI really, really did.\n\n806\n00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,610\nLet me show you guys this.\n\n807\n00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,920\nSo, here's what Ronnie is talking about.\n\n808\n00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,700\nBasically you take an iPad, and\n\n809\n00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,940\non the iPad you can run,\nyou can run really whatever you want.\n\n810\n00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,340\nWebEx, go to meetings,\nSkype, facetime, whatever.\n\n811\n00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,780\nAnd you take your iPad and you stick\nit on this stand that has gyros and\n\n812\n00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,860\nwheels on it.\n\n813\n00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,793\nAnd you then run their other application\nwhich is basically a remote control\n\n814\n00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:54,293\ndevice.\n\n815\n00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:56,524\nAnd so\nI could be sitting her in Florida, and\n\n816\n00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:59,611\nI could take one of these robots and\nstick it up in Seattle,.\n\n817\n00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,876\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or Washington.\n\n818\n00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:05,208\nAnd walk around the office and\ntalk to people and, and do things.\n\n819\n00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:09,862\nAnd granted its, you know, a robot stand\nbut, people who see it and it does\n\n820\n00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:14,680\ncreate more of a physical presence than\nyou just sending emails or, or whatever.\n\n821\n00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,280\nIt allows you to be there and\nit's got cameras so you can see and\n\n822\n00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,560\nthey can see you and you can,\nyou know, add this thing.\n\n823\n00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,460\nGo into, into a, a board room.\n\n824\n00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,290\nAnd if the battery runs low it actually\ngoes back and finds it's dock and\n\n825\n00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,570\ncharges itself which\nis really really cool.\n\n826\n00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,390\nAnd not incredibly expensive, I think\nthey were like $1,500 or something.\n\n827\n00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,275\n>> Yeah, the last one I saw\nwas like $2,400 dollars.\n\n828\n00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,550\nBut Don, I think this guy,\n\n829\n00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,222\nthe guy on the iPad there, on that,\nI, I think he's invading his space.\n\n830\n00:40:39,222 --> 00:40:40,710\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n831\n00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,360\nLittle close there.\n\n832\n00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,010\n>> He is a little close [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n833\n00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,920\nyou know I, I saw a show once where\nthey were joking around about this where\n\n834\n00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,930\nthere was a guy and\nhe like kept bothering people.\n\n835\n00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,510\n>> Right.\n\n836\n00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,080\n>> And so they would, they would walk by.\n\n837\n00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,430\nAnd any time somebody would walk by,\nthey would like turn it off.\n\n838\n00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,990\nAnd they would just hit the,\nthe power button.\n\n839\n00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,530\nOr, or\n\n840\n00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,780\nthey'd stick something in front of it\n>> Right.\n\n841\n00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,820\n>> So it couldn't go over it.\n\n842\n00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,770\nYou know, any, any little thing on\nthe ground would stop it from moving.\n\n843\n00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,140\nBut but yeah, it's neat stuff, and\n\n844\n00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,050\nthis is all about their telepresence\n>> There it is, yeah.\n\n845\n00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,430\n>> And, oh it is 2500,\nI guess I I'm discounting it already.\n\n846\n00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,670\nBut, it can be a little expensive but\nif you're somebody that works out of\n\n847\n00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,930\nthe office a good bit,\nthat $2,500 is worth it,\n\n848\n00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:19,450\nto create that personal experience you\ndon't have by being out of the office.\n\n849\n00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,040\nSo, definitely neat stuff there and\nstuff we're gonna see more of.\n\n850\n00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,380\n>> Oh, James in our chatroom even\nsaid that Snowden did a TED Talk\n\n851\n00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,951\nwith one of these.\n\n852\n00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:27,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I did not know that.\n\n853\n00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,919\n>> Old Edward Snowden.\n\n854\n00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:29,544\nThat guy.\n\n855\n00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:30,297\nSo yeah.\n\n856\n00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:33,910\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nhe of all people can't travel anywhere.\n\n857\n00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,850\nSo if you can't be there in person\nthis is probably the next best thing.\n\n858\n00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,870\nAll right, so the last one we\nhave on our list is one that.\n\n859\n00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:48,330\nI would argue is, is rapidly becoming\na common technology, not alternative.\n\n860\n00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,540\nSo, gesture based controls.\n\n861\n00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,770\nA lot of computer systems rely\non a mouse and a keyboard, but\n\n862\n00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,920\nover the last handful of years we see\nthis, this movement towards tablets.\n\n863\n00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,760\nAnd with tablets, we've seen the general\nacceptance of touch screens.\n\n864\n00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,410\nAnd so you have some devices like, Ronnie,\nyour, your laptop has a touchscreen, so\n\n865\n00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,820\nyou can manipulate it by touching the,\nthe screen.\n\n866\n00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,320\nThat's the name.\n\n867\n00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,250\nThat was kinda stupid, but but\nthen you take like my laptop.\n\n868\n00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,990\nI don't have a touchscreen, all right,\nso not everybody is doing it yet.\n\n869\n00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,590\nBut many people are.\n\n870\n00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,790\nAnd if it's leveraged properly,\nit works really well.\n\n871\n00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,630\nNow Ronnie,\nyou've got a touch screen on your laptop.\n\n872\n00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,110\nHow, how often do you\nuse the touch screen?\n\n873\n00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,460\n>> I, I didn't think I was using if often.\n\n874\n00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,750\nI mean, I really did not,\nuntil the day I had the,\n\n875\n00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,290\nto kind of grab my daughter's laptop,\nwhich had no touch screen on it.\n\n876\n00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,560\nAnd I found myself trying\nto swipe on the screen.\n\n877\n00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,650\nI was like Why isn't this thing working?\n\n878\n00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,270\nAnd she looked over and says, Dad,\nthere's no touch interaction with it.\n\n879\n00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,155\nI was like, oh.\n\n880\n00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:45,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n881\n00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,340\nI, I really didn't think\nI was that used to it.\n\n882\n00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,870\nSo I use it more often than I think,\nbut even then when I think about it,\n\n883\n00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,870\nI don't really touch it that often.\n\n884\n00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,840\n>> The,\nthe tactile experience of a touch screen.\n\n885\n00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,940\nYou know, the reaching out and\ntouching something.\n\n886\n00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,610\nIt's It's intuitive.\n\n887\n00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,680\nIt's something that we know as humans.\n\n888\n00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680\nIt, it, make more sense than this mouse.\n\n889\n00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680\nThis thing off on the side that\nsomehow correlates with the screen.\n\n890\n00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,540\nHere we're touching,\nwe know what's happening.\n\n891\n00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,760\nSo it makes sense to us, and, and\nwe do use it and we do it subconsciously.\n\n892\n00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,160\nWhen I first got this laptop, I, I've\nonly had this three or four months and\n\n893\n00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,280\nwhen I first got it the first two weeks,\nI kept touching the screen over and\n\n894\n00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,650\nover again and it, it just I was already\nused to that from my, my old laptop.\n\n895\n00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,350\nSo we're seeing it more.\n\n896\n00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,045\nCell phones and tablets it's a guarantee\nyou're gonna have a touch screens today.\n\n897\n00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:35,565\nLaptops and desktop computers\nthough it's coming along, right?\n\n898\n00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,895\nOn my desk here at the office,\nI don't have touch screens.\n\n899\n00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:41,625\nOn my computer at home I do have\na touch screen and I rarely use it and\n\n900\n00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:45,362\nthat's because on a desktop, my mouse is\nright here, but I've gotta reach way up\n\n901\n00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:47,992\nthere to touch the screen, and\nthat's not so intuitive anymore.\n\n902\n00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,832\nSo that's what's keeping this from\nbecoming a common technology is\n\n903\n00:43:50,832 --> 00:43:54,392\nthat people just aren't used to that,\nand the operating system vendors haven't\n\n904\n00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:56,931\nupdated their IOS's to be\nfully touch compliant.\n\n905\n00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,381\nEven Microsoft, who tried,\nreally just didn't do it right.\n\n906\n00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:03,521\nSo, so we are gonna see that more and\nnot just touch.\n\n907\n00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,821\nRight?\n\n908\n00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:06,891\nWe'll see some other things too,\nlike kinetics, but, but\n\n909\n00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:07,941\nI guess before I get beyond that.\n\n910\n00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:09,960\nLet me make sure we hit\nour objectives here.\n\n911\n00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,570\nComptia specifically calls out swiping and\npinch to zoom.\n\n912\n00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,570\nNow swiping I've already\nused here in this show.\n\n913\n00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,690\nApple decided not to do touch screens, but\ninstead to do these nice big touchpads\n\n914\n00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,260\nwhere you can do gestures and\nswiping and so on on the touchpad.\n\n915\n00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,140\nMicrosoft went with\ntouchscreens on the computer so\n\n916\n00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,140\nyou can actually do it on the screen.\n\n917\n00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,540\nThe main reason Apple didn't do it\nwas when you touch the screen you put\n\n918\n00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,440\nfingerprints on you and, you know,\na lot of their screens have those really\n\n919\n00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,410\nhigh resolution displays and they,\nthey want to try and keep that clean.\n\n920\n00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,720\nBut I've used it to switch between\nmy virtual machines, right?\n\n921\n00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,790\nSo let me show you guys my desktop again,\nand when I was showing you guys earlier,\n\n922\n00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,390\nlike here I'm on Mac and here I'm\non Linux and here I'm on Windows 7.\n\n923\n00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,210\nRight.\n\n924\n00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,630\nThe way that I'm doing that is\nI'm doing a three finger swipe.\n\n925\n00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,930\nI take three fingers and\nI swipe them from left to right or\n\n926\n00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,870\nright to left on my touchpad.\n\n927\n00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,490\nSo it's a gesture.\n\n928\n00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,160\nI can do that.\n\n929\n00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,240\nI'm, I'm sure there's a keyboard shortcut\nfor that, I'm sure there's a mouse\n\n930\n00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,150\nshortcut, but there's all sorts of\nlittle like code, basically, you know,\n\n931\n00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,940\nlike a secret handshake that I do with\nthe touchpad to tell it to do things.\n\n932\n00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,640\nIf I want to see all my desktops,\nI do three fingers up, and\n\n933\n00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,490\nthere's all my desktops and\nI can quickly flip there.\n\n934\n00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,340\nOr, three fingers down does a, a document\nview and, and shows part of my desktop.\n\n935\n00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,910\nThere's other ones like pinch to zoom\nlet me show you an example of that.\n\n936\n00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,640\nLet me get into Safari here,\nand I'll go to a website,\n\n937\n00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,200\nlet's go to a website that I know\nhas a lot of small text on it.\n\n938\n00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,620\nI'll go to Google News, all right.\n\n939\n00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,240\nSo here I'm on Google News and\nI wanna read this article right here but\n\n940\n00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,270\nthere's so\nmuch other stuff on this webpage.\n\n941\n00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,350\nAnd they've made it kinda small, right?\n\n942\n00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,580\nSo what I can do is I can\ntake two fingers and I can,\n\n943\n00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,050\nI can go like this to spread out and\nwhen I do that it makes everything bigger.\n\n944\n00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,740\nAnd then I can take my fingers and\nI can pinch,\n\n945\n00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,690\nlike that, and\nit makes everything smaller.\n\n946\n00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,480\nIf you've got a tablet or a cell phone\nyou've probably done this yourself.\n\n947\n00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,780\nRight.\nIt's pinch to zoom and\n\n948\n00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,630\nit works really well.\n\n949\n00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,560\nOn desktops and\nlaptops it's still kinda evolving.\n\n950\n00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,680\nAnd, you see how smooth that is?\n\n951\n00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,350\nRight?\n\n952\n00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,250\nSome vendors have really taken the time\nto do that, to make it nice and smooth.\n\n953\n00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,410\nOther ones haven't, and let me show you\nthat same thing here in Chrome, and\n\n954\n00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,410\nI haven't done this in a while,\nso they might have fixed it but\n\n955\n00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,910\nwith Chrome it used to be super blocky.\n\n956\n00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,410\nAnd if I wanted to get in and\nview just a little section here.\n\n957\n00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,900\nLike just this article, then I would\ngo and do the pinched to zoom.\n\n958\n00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> See what it's doing?\n\n959\n00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,500\nHow it's really blocky as it does that?\n\n960\n00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,305\nIn fact, it's not even working that well.\n\n961\n00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:44,670\nS,o not every application supports it.\n\n962\n00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,720\nAnd some are super slick with it,\nsome are pretty crummy.\n\n963\n00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,950\nThis would be an example\nof one that's crummy.\n\n964\n00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,780\nSo, so that stuff is,\nis still kinda evolving.\n\n965\n00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,970\nNow Ronny you can do that right on your\nscreen not on your touchpad right?\n\n966\n00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,660\n>> Right, ya so\nI've got a PDF document open just so\n\n967\n00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,230\nthat we can see the same thing.\n\n968\n00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,990\nSo on my screen it's the same motions\nessentially, where if I want to do\n\n969\n00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,190\nthe pinch to zoom I can just do that and I\njust spread my fingers out on the screen,\n\n970\n00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,260\nand then I can just pinch them closed and\nwe're ready to, to be able to do that.\n\n971\n00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,980\nThe nice thing is that once you, once you\nget one and you don't think you're really\n\n972\n00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,430\nusing it, that's when you actually realize\nyou're using it more often than you think.\n\n973\n00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,850\nSo, those gestures.\n\n974\n00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,280\nI also have that trackpad that\nI can do these swipes on.\n\n975\n00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,810\nExcept that there's something very weird\nabout our trackpads here on the XPSs.\n\n976\n00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,890\nAnd, I wish I could say, oh yeah,\nit works exactly like the app one does,\n\n977\n00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,900\nI would be lying to you.\n\n978\n00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,940\nThis thing is terrible.\n\n979\n00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,520\n>> Yeah,\nDell makes bad choices on that one.\n\n980\n00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,320\nBut it is more intuitive\ndoing it on the screen.\n\n981\n00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,360\n>> Oh yeah, right there.\n\n982\n00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360\n>> Because it's like your pinching in and\n\n983\n00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,890\nzooming in the application versus\nme where I'm kind of disembodied.\n\n984\n00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:51,740\nOn a tablet or\nphone you'd be doing it on that device.\n\n985\n00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,885\nThe other one they call out is kinetics.\n\n986\n00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:55,579\nAnd kinetics I think are really cool and\n\n987\n00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:58,978\nwe are starting to see some of this evolve\nmostly in the video gaming industry.\n\n988\n00:47:58,978 --> 00:48:01,989\nNot so much in the regular\nbusiness computing yet.\n\n989\n00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:05,900\nWith Kinetics, you're doing gestures, but\nwithout touching the computer, all right.\n\n990\n00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,590\nIt's where you have physical gestures that\nyou do, and they can be very complex or\n\n991\n00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,940\nthey can be very simple.\n\n992\n00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,280\nFor example, maybe you're watching\na video on your computer.\n\n993\n00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,750\nYour computer can be tracking your video\nmove, your body movements, and if you get\n\n994\n00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,640\nup and walk away to go to the restroom,\nit can see that and pause the video.\n\n995\n00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640\nThat's Kinetics.\n\n996\n00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,010\nYou didn't touch the computer to do it,\nit knew to do it because you walked away.\n\n997\n00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:33,460\nOne of the best examples of\nthat is the Microsoft Kinect,\n\n998\n00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,238\nand let me just pull up their website.\n\n999\n00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:39,416\nMicrosoft Kinect, which they originally\nreleased for the Xbox 360, for\n\n1000\n00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,193\nvideo games.\n\n1001\n00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:42,695\nAnd the idea was that you would\nhook it up to your Xbox, and\n\n1002\n00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:45,719\nif you played a game where you're on\na boat, you would stand there and\n\n1003\n00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:48,847\npretend like you were paddling and\nit would watch you and say, oh look,\n\n1004\n00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:51,120\nhe's making the hand gestures,\nhe's paddling.\n\n1005\n00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,510\nAnd it was this big sensor bar,\nit's got a camera and a sensor, and\n\n1006\n00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,810\nit would sit on top of your computer, and\n\n1007\n00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,210\nit would basically just track your\nmovements and take actions based on that.\n\n1008\n00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:02,930\nSo that's what it did.\n\n1009\n00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,930\nWell, it's made the jump,\nfrom video gaming over to computers, and\n\n1010\n00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,019\nso now, they make it where you can hook it\nup to a Windows machine, to your desktop,\n\n1011\n00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:15,307\nand developers can use\nthe software development kit,\n\n1012\n00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:19,250\nSDK, to create physical motion\ngestures for their software.\n\n1013\n00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,000\nAnd so now we're seeing things like,\ninstead of doing a three\n\n1014\n00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,540\nfinger swipe to change my screen, I can\nactually just go like this in the air.\n\n1015\n00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,550\nYou go like this in the air, and\n\n1016\n00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,770\nit sees you make that motion and\nit knows to move the screen over.\n\n1017\n00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,700\nOr if you want to make something bigger or\nsmaller,\n\n1018\n00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,760\nyou go like this with your hands and\nit sees you do that.\n\n1019\n00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,300\nIt's like that movie Minority Report\nwith terrible Tom Cruise, and\n\n1020\n00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,320\nhe's doing all this stuff in the air,\nthat's what Kinect does.\n\n1021\n00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,490\nYou don't touch the computer, you're doing\nphysical motions and there's pros and\n\n1022\n00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,130\ncons of that.\n\n1023\n00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,950\nThe movements are usually far less\nefficient cuz they're bigger motions.\n\n1024\n00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,200\nYou have to have certain lighting present\nfor it to work, if it's a dim room,\n\n1025\n00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,660\nit doesn't work very well.\n\n1026\n00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,000\nBut on a positive side, you're doing\nphysical motion, which really helps out\n\n1027\n00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,360\nwith a lot of the problems that we\ndevelop by sitting in an office chair for\n\n1028\n00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,300\nhours on end every day,\nit shortens your lifespan.\n\n1029\n00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,680\nSo, this helps to get you a little more\nmobile, and a little more healthy.\n\n1030\n00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,700\nSo definitely some side benefits there.\n\n1031\n00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,360\nBut this stuff is really cool.\n\n1032\n00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,754\nKinetics can take other forms too,\nlike there are projected keyboards,\n\n1033\n00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:26,974\nlet me see if I can find one of those,\nwhere if you're using a computer,\n\n1034\n00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:31,585\nthat doesn't have a big keyboard\nlike a cell phone, right, so\n\n1035\n00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:35,067\nhere they're showing\nthis little cell phone.\n\n1036\n00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:39,306\nAnd you want to type a message, they make\nthese devices that'll actually protect,\n\n1037\n00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:42,469\nproject a picture of a keyboard,\nand you start typing just like\n\n1038\n00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:47,162\nyou're using a real keyboard, and it's\nsensing where your fingers are going down.\n\n1039\n00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:51,280\nThat's kinetics, you're not actually\ntouching the device, you're doing motions.\n\n1040\n00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,290\nThe projection here is just so\nyou know where to put your fingers, and\n\n1041\n00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,980\nthen it's able to go and type that, so.\n\n1042\n00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,380\nDo we have a bigger picture?\n\n1043\n00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,170\nI guess that's about as big as it's gonna\nget, but this is the projector, and\n\n1044\n00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,240\nthey've got it tied to their iPhone there,\nso they're typing on a table.\n\n1045\n00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,250\nThis kind of stuff is neat,\nit's not terribly expensive.\n\n1046\n00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,000\nThat I think was $100,\nis that what it said?\n\n1047\n00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,060\n>> Yeah I think 99.\n\n1048\n00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,800\n>> Yep.\n\n1049\n00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,000\nAnd the prices are coming down on\nthis stuff, so we'll see more and\n\n1050\n00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,220\nmore of this introduced in\nequipment as time progresses.\n\n1051\n00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,920\nBut for right now, this is very\nmuch an alternative technology.\n\n1052\n00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,050\nMost people do not have kinetic\nsensors on their devices.\n\n1053\n00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,570\nAmazon did it with their cellphone, right?\n\n1054\n00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,300\nThat, what was it called,\nthe Amazon Fire Phone or something?\n\n1055\n00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,440\nWhat was their phone called?\n\n1056\n00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,690\n>> I can't remember.\n\n1057\n00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,630\n>> I know it's only for\n99 cents now, that's all I know.\n\n1058\n00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,710\n>> Yeah.\nHere, let me show you guys this thing,\n\n1059\n00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,580\nthe Amazon Fire Phone.\n\n1060\n00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,730\nIt's got a camera right here,\nlike most cellphones do.\n\n1061\n00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,080\nBut see how this one has these\nlittle dots on the corners,\n\n1062\n00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,750\nthat's actually four more cameras.\n\n1063\n00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,530\nSo that there's five cameras on the front,\nwell this is the one that takes selfies,\n\n1064\n00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,080\nso you can post them on Instagram,\nvery important.\n\n1065\n00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,530\nBut the other four, are actually\njust tracking your facial position.\n\n1066\n00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:04,320\nAnd what it does if you tilt your phone,\nit will see your face is off to the side,\n\n1067\n00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,740\nand it will actually tilt the images\nto match the way your face is.\n\n1068\n00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,580\nSo even if you're looking at it at\nan angle, it'll look properly aligned.\n\n1069\n00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,225\n>> Nice.\n>> So you get better visibility out of it.\n\n1070\n00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:18,910\nIt's a neat idea,\nit is as gimmicky as all hell.\n\n1071\n00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,750\nIt's sorta a marketing thing, but like\nyou said Ronnie, it has not sold well.\n\n1072\n00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,206\n>> No.\n>> The reviews aren't great.\n\n1073\n00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:26,830\nSo now you can get it for zero bucks.\n\n1074\n00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:28,669\n>> Yeah.\n>> ON contract, so\n\n1075\n00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:31,600\nit's the first of its kind.\n\n1076\n00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,670\nYou can expect this.\n\n1077\n00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,998\nEarly adopters always get\na rough experience, but\n\n1078\n00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:37,732\nyou'll probably see more of\nthis coming down the road.\n\n1079\n00:52:37,732 --> 00:52:39,791\nSamsung, they had some interesting stuff,\nright?\n\n1080\n00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,107\n>> Yeah.\nI think on my phone,\n\n1081\n00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:43,737\nI haven't checked it cuz I don't\nturn all that stuff on cuz it\n\n1082\n00:52:43,737 --> 00:52:45,460\neats battery life, I think.\n\n1083\n00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,300\nBut mine actually is supposed to stay on.\n\n1084\n00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,027\nIn other words, even if I use\nthe high power-saving features,\n\n1085\n00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:55,593\nas long as I'm looking at the screen\nitself, it knows that I'm looking at it.\n\n1086\n00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:59,121\nSo I'm assuming that it's got a camera,\nthat's really watching the eye motion and\n\n1087\n00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:02,500\nyou know, as long as I'm looking at it,\nit's not gonna ever go to sleep.\n\n1088\n00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,350\n>> It's watching you, right?\n\n1089\n00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,200\n>> It is watching me.\n\n1090\n00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,710\n>> It's like 1984.\n\n1091\n00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,380\n>> I know, it's kinda creepy.\n\n1092\n00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,385\nThat's why I don't turn it on.\n\n1093\n00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,190\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't like that stuff.\n\n1094\n00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,430\nBut it is neat, you know, the idea of it.\n\n1095\n00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,660\nAnd it will take a while,\nto evolve for general use.\n\n1096\n00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,530\nEverybody knows how to use a keyboard.\n\n1097\n00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,520\nThat doesn't mean a keyboard is the best\nway to get text into your computer.\n\n1098\n00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,180\nIt's just what we're used to.\n\n1099\n00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,583\nAnd so when something better comes along,\nlike speech detect or something like that,\n\n1100\n00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,531\nit takes a little while to be adopted.\n\n1101\n00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:33,135\nSo these are flagged as alternative\ntechnologies until they become standard\n\n1102\n00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:37,662\ncomponents in an average computer\nthat you buy off the shelf.\n\n1103\n00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:39,697\nAll right, so Ronnie,\nI think that pretty much wraps up 1.4,\n\n1104\n00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:41,590\ncan you think of any other ones\nthat we should throw in there?\n\n1105\n00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,430\n>> I don't think so, I think all\nthese alternative technologies now,\n\n1106\n00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,190\nwe're going to see in the next couple of\nyears are probably going to become so\n\n1107\n00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,470\nstandardized we're not even\ngonna consider them again.\n\n1108\n00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,060\n>> And these were all pretty safe ones.\n\n1109\n00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,262\nThere are some that, that just come and\ngo, things like the Segway scooter.\n\n1110\n00:53:58,262 --> 00:54:01,935\nThat was an alternative technology\nthat kind of not made it,\n\n1111\n00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:04,740\nthe Nintendo Power Glove\nif you remember that thing,\n\n1112\n00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,010\nsometimes people come up with ideas,\nand they're not good.\n\n1113\n00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,650\nAnd so they go away, and\nyou don't see them any more.\n\n1114\n00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,420\nSo, that's definitely something that\ncould happen with a lot of the newer\n\n1115\n00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,830\ntechnologies that come out.\n\n1116\n00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,777\nYou just kind of have to wait and\nsee if stuff will pan out.\n\n1117\n00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:20,490\nAll right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, let me remind you guys,\n\n1118\n00:54:20,490 -->

00:00:37.265\nAll right, good morning, good afternoon\nand good evening and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:38.760\nTo another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.800\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.490\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.530\n&gt;&gt; It is going well today.\n\n9\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.300\nAnother sunny,\nbeautiful day here in Florida.\n\n10\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.560\nAnd another exciting episode once again in\n\n11\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.310\nIT fundamentals that we're\nready to get started.\n\n12\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.000\n&gt;&gt; Now this is gonna be a fun episode\nbecause we're moving away from regular\n\n13\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.930\ncomputers.\n\n14\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.140\nAnd moving to mobile devices.\n\n15\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.845\nAnd what we're really looking at our, our\nCompTIA brands as a, a wireless device.\n\n16\n00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:06.350\nSo we're talking about cell phones and\niPads that don't have a home.\n\n17\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.450\nThat you, you're constantly taking various\nplaces and they a, a little bit of a,\n\n18\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.130\na different, set of characteristics\nthan we would with a normal PC.\n\n19\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.090\nAll right.\n\n20\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.770\nOne of the big areas that we need to talk\nabout is security, and when you think\n\n21\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.960\nabout like a, a desktop PC, so if I\nhad a desktop PC sitting in a desk and\n\n22\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.810\nin my office, I really don't have\nto worry so much about losing it.\n\n23\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.850\nI'm not gonna misplace it.\n\n24\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.670\nIt sits right on my desk and that's\nwhere it is and that's the end of it.\n\n25\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.880\nBut if somebody broke in, they could,\nin theory, you know, steal it and\n\n26\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.200\nit would go, but it's pretty unlikely,\nso for the most part,\n\n27\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.680\nI'm always gonna know\nwhere that desktop is.\n\n28\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.770\nWith a laptop,\nsometimes I might travel with it.\n\n29\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.620\nSometimes I might not.\n\n30\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.640\nAnd, and so when I'm traveling, yeah,\n\n31\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.800\nthere's a chance that I could lose\nthe device, but it's pretty big.\n\n32\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.140\nIt's pretty obvious when you\ndon't have your laptop with you.\n\n33\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.200\nBut when you talk about cell phones,\nthey're very small.\n\n34\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.960\nWe always carry them with us,\n\n35\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920\nthe odds of us losing a cell phone\nbecomes much, much higher, all right?\n\n36\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.240\nIf you were to ask around\nthe people you know and say, hey,\n\n37\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.540\nhave you ever lost a laptop?\n\n38\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.320\nJust forgotten where it was?\n\n39\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.825\nMost people will say no, but\n\n40\n00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.584\nif you ask for\npeople who have lost a cell phone that,\n\n41\n00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:20.634\nthat happens a lot, you know, [CROSSTALK]\nenough that they sell insurance.\n\n42\n00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:22.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing where, when you,\n\n43\n00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:25.950\nyou go down to places like\nUniversal Studios or Disney World.\n\n44\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.175\nThese amusement parks, and how many of\nthese devices end up in lost and found.\n\n45\n00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:31.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And that's because people will\n\n46\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.480\ngo on these high G-force rides and\nactually put them in their pocket or\n\n47\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.060\ntheir shirt pocket.\n\n48\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.560\n&gt;&gt; It just flies out and then, you know\nthey have to go and get it at some point.\n\n50\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.710\nBut it's amazing how many of\nthose devices do get lost.\n\n51\n00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you leave it on a bus, you leave\nit in the back of a taxi cab or whatever,\n\n52\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.060\nand, and\nthese are the things that can happen.\n\n53\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.110\nWell, the problem is not so\nmuch losing the device right that, that,\n\n54\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.000\nthat, that sucks.\n\n55\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.570\nNobody wants to lose their device.\n\n56\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.600\nBut what if you have sensitive\ninformation on that device?\n\n57\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.440\nThese smartphones and\nthese tablets are very powerful.\n\n58\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.920\nAnd they typically have access to\nthe same data as your computer at home or\n\n59\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.870\nat your office.\n\n60\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.960\nSo you might have personal documents.\n\n61\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.950\nYou might have access to your work email.\n\n62\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.700\nYou might have a, a VPN tunnel set up\non there to connect to your work office\n\n63\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.390\non this device that you just lost.\n\n64\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.570\nAnd if somebody gets a hold of that,\nthey could now have access to all of that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.270\nSo there's various things we\nneed to do to secure the device.\n\n66\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.570\nNow and I do think it's kind of funny\nthat, that CompTIA combines unlocking and\n\n67\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.330\nsecurity together the first one,\nunlocking doesn't necessarily help us.\n\n68\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.520\nUnlocking is something that, or, or\n\n69\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.430\nlocking in general is something that\nhelps the, the cell phone providers.\n\n70\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.070\nAll right, when you get a cell phone, and\nit's not like this all over the world, so\n\n71\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.890\nlet me, let me clarify this.\n\n72\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.900\nIn Europe, it's very traditional\nthat when you get a cell phone,\n\n73\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.670\nyou buy the cell phone and\nyou pay full price for it and\n\n74\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.760\nthen you can go and get cell phone\nservice from whoever you want.\n\n75\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.170\nYou buy a SIM card and stick it in there.\n\n76\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.729\nSo if you want to go with, you know,\n\n77\n00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.530\nd, Dutch Telecom,\nyou just buy their card and stick it in.\n\n78\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.830\nYou want to go with Orange, you buy\ntheir card and you stick it in there.\n\n79\n00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.070\nYou want O3, you pick it up and\npop it in there, right?\n\n80\n00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.080\nAnd so you can switch whenever you want.\n\n81\n00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.750\nIn the United States,\nthat model is actually very rare.\n\n82\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.210\nInstead, here,\npeople get a cell phone under contract and\n\n83\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.610\nthey say, all right I will slowly pay for\nthis phone over two years\n\n84\n00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.540\nas part of my phone contact so\nI get it at a lower price.\n\n85\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.867\nBut you're signing this agreement that\nsays, I will be with AT&amp;T for two years or\n\n86\n00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.580\nT-Mobile for two years or whoever, right?\n\n87\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.290\nSo you're basically entering\ninto a binding agreement.\n\n88\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.040\nAnd so a lot of the phone companies,\nwhen you get that cell phone, they'll say,\n\n89\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.740\nyou know, it's not entirely yours yet.\n\n90\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.100\nIt's not yours until the contract is over,\nso we're gonna lock it.\n\n91\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.830\nThat phone will only work on our network.\n\n92\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.070\nYou get an AT&amp;T phone, and\nit'll only work on AT&amp;T.\n\n93\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.730\nAll right.\n\n94\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.060\nThat's called a locked phone and\nit's basically a,\n\n95\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.610\na, a little setting inside\nof the handset itself.\n\n96\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.970\nIt's not on the SIM card,\nbecause you can swap a SIM card out, so\n\n97\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.010\nit's on the phone itself, this says\nit'll only work with this carrier.\n\n98\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.780\nWell, at the end of your contract,\nwhen it's over, when you've paid for\n\n99\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.510\nthe phone in full or, or at least\nsatisfy the terms of whatever agreement\n\n100\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.580\nyou were on,\nwhich you usually get a discount.\n\n101\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.570\nAt the end of it the phone\nis still locked.\n\n102\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.878\nBut you can reach out to the phone\nprovider and say, hey, can you,\n\n103\n00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:12.303\ncan you please unlock this phone and\nunder U.S.\n\n104\n00:05:12.303 --> 00:05:14.820\nlaw now they're actually\nrequired to do it.\n\n105\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.460\nAs long as you've satisfied the terms\nof your contract they have to\n\n106\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.170\nunlock the phone.\n\n107\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.230\nAnd when it's unlocked you\ncan now take that phone and\n\n108\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.660\nuse it on a different provider assuming\nthey're the same wireless technology.\n\n109\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.260\nAgain in Europe, you have a nice\nstandard cellular system over there,\n\n110\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.120\nhere in the US it's the, the Wild West.\n\n111\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120\nIt's a mess the, the different providers.\n\n112\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo a phone that works on Sprint probably\nwon't work on Verizon which probably won't\n\n113\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.380\nwork on AT&amp;T and so that,\nthat's a bit of a, a nightmare.\n\n114\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.070\nBut you can get your phone unlocked and,\nand go that route.\n\n115\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.550\nIf you're gonna sell your phone on,\non eBay or something,\n\n116\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.510\nyou might choose to unlock it before\nyou sell it, some people will actually\n\n117\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.330\npay extra if the phone has been unlocked,\ngives them more and more flexibility.\n\n118\n00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:55.708\nBut while your phone's under contract,\nyou typically can't unlock it and\n\n119\n00:05:55.708 --> 00:06:01.390\nthere's people, there's websites you can\ngo to where you can share the IEMI number,\n\n120\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.370\nthe little serial number on your phone,\nand\n\n121\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.290\nthey can use that to unlock your phone.\n\n122\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.000\nAnd they do it,\nthey charge a fee for that.\n\n123\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.380\nThat's legal within the terms of\nthe US laws as they're defined.\n\n124\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.980\nBut you're still under contract with\nyour provider, it doesn't get you out of\n\n125\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.740\nyour contract, and so some providers are,\nare not too happy about that, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.310\nSo that's security from\nthe phone company side, right,\n\n127\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.230\nthat's protecting their investment\nthey've made in you, all right.\n\n128\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.810\nBut how do we protect ourselves?\n\n129\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.290\nAnd that's where we get into\nthe security of phones.\n\n130\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.260\nAnd there's a number of things we can do.\n\n131\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.800\nRight, Ronny?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n132\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's a ton of\n\n133\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.290\nbells and whistles-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.140\nThere's a lot of times when we could just\ndo the thing that we always know how to\n\n135\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.810\ndo, which is just simply\nenter in a password but\n\n136\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.290\nof course today with the newer devices,\nyou can also have finger print swipes.\n\n137\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.950\nYou can have the the,\nthe different pass-codes that you can use.\n\n138\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.330\nLike number pass-codes or pin numbers.\n\n139\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.060\nSo you name it, there's different\nways that we can secure it.\n\n140\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.998\nAnd there's a lot more settings\nthan there used to be.\n\n141\n00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:54.949\nYeah.\n\n142\n00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that, that on screen password.\n\n143\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.970\nThat's one of the easiest.\n\n144\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.730\nThey, pretty much every phone supports it.\n\n145\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.500\nEven the phones that don't have\ntouch screen support that.\n\n146\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.970\nMost people will apply a, a 4 digit\npass-code to their phone so that any\n\n147\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.870\ntime you pick up the phone, if you wanna\nunlock it to be able to use it, right?\n\n148\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.580\nI'm talking about unlocking the screen,\nnot unlocking the carrier.\n\n149\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.700\nBut if you want to do that\nyou just punch in the code.\n\n150\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.840\nThat's very, very old technology,\nyou just pick a four digit code,\n\n151\n00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.820\nmost of them do limit you to four, some\nlet you do more like Blackberry's they'll\n\n152\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.560\nlet you do as long a code as you want.\n\n153\n00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.650\nBut if you're in a hurry to get in\nthe phone you don't want to have to sit\n\n154\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.060\nthere and type some crazy long thing out\nso it's normally just a four digit code,\n\n155\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.990\nyou unlock the phone and\nyou gain access to it.\n\n156\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.470\nOther phones get a little more advanced,\nright?\n\n157\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.910\nAndroid phones from Google,\nthey have pattern unlock.\n\n158\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.690\nWhich is pretty neat!\n\n159\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.041\nInstead of punching in a code, you draw\na pattern that you've determined and\n\n160\n00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:48.721\npeople can do that pretty quickly, and\nit's pretty hard to guess, a pattern.\n\n161\n00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:52.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these pattern unlocks are very\nneat until you hand it to someone like\n\n162\n00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:55.621\nmy daughter, who creates a very complex\npattern that she can't remember.\n\n163\n00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:56.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n164\n00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:58.434\nthen you're a little bit more locked out.\n\n165\n00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:01.345\nAnd then once she remembers\nit Then it's better, but\n\n166\n00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:04.838\nyou actually start to remember\nthat these patterns, you know,\n\n167\n00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:08.476\nnormally they're like a nine dot\npattern or something like that.\n\n168\n00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:10.860\nYou actually just draw and\nlink those lines together.\n\n169\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.340\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorites was, though, if\nsomebody doesn't keep their phone clean,\n\n170\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.460\nyou can actually see the finger\nsmudge as they draw their pattern.\n\n171\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.618\nSo you know, there's, there's\nweaknesses to all of these really but\n\n172\n00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:23.530\nit is neat to not have a code to remember,\nbut just a drawing.\n\n173\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.600\nOne of the newer things we're seeing\nin cell phones are biometrics,\n\n174\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.040\nfingerprints, right?\n\n175\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.640\nSo iPhones, on Samsung Galaxy,\n\n176\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.180\nI think they started with the S\n5 with fingerprints, right?\n\n177\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.425\nSo the Galaxy S 5 with iPhone,\nit was the iPhone 5s,\n\n178\n00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:42.350\nI think that started the,\nthe finger prints.\n\n179\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.070\nWhere if you wanna unlock the phone\ninstead of punching in a code or, or\n\n180\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.800\ndrawing a picture, you'd place your\nfinger on a finger sensor, and\n\n181\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.650\nit is usually embedded in the home button,\nand it would scan your finger.\n\n182\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.680\nAnd if it's you,\nit would unlock the phone and let you in.\n\n183\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.940\nFingerprints are nice,\nbecause you can't forget a fingerprint.\n\n184\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.710\nRight?\nIt's, it's a part of you.\n\n185\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.530\nOn a positive side,\nit gives you great security.\n\n186\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.140\nOn a negative side,\n\n187\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.450\nit does make it a little harder\nto loan your phone to somebody.\n\n188\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.900\nRight?\nYou can tell somebody your code.\n\n189\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.350\nYeah, you wanna unlock my phone it's 1234,\nright?\n\n190\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.700\nBut, you can't say yeah, it's just my\nfingerprint, here, here, take my finger.\n\n191\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.210\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; And they do have backups on this.\n\n192\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.560\nIf somebody swipes their\nfingerprints wrong too many times,\n\n193\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.270\nthey'll normally ask you for\nthe alternative password, or\n\n194\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.530\nalternative passcode,\nto be able to get in.\n\n195\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.950\nMy frustrating thing about the fingerprint\nscanner is that if it's late at night and\n\n196\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.020\nsomething buzzes in,\nI never get the fingerprint exactly right.\n\n197\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.460\nAnd I'm just sitting there and\nthen all the sudden it says,\n\n198\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.600\nenter the alternative password\nyou've tried too many times.\n\n199\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.020\nAnd so yeah you have to kind of be,\nbe consistent when you swipe it.\n\n200\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.262\n&gt;&gt; You know something I hadn't thought of\nwhen I, when I got my first device that\n\n201\n00:09:46.262 --> 00:09:49.468\nhad a fingerprint scanner\n&gt;&gt; You know in my mind I got it, I was\n\n202\n00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:53.768\nlike, I want to turn this on, it's cool\nand let me program in my index finger,\n\n203\n00:09:53.768 --> 00:09:58.096\nyou know, primary finger so I, I get\nthe phone, I program in my index finger.\n\n204\n00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.340\nI'm like it's ready to go,\nit's working fine and\n\n205\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.731\nthen as I started using the phone through\nthe week, I was like man it's really\n\n206\n00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:07.384\ninconvenient to do that because if I'm\ndriving, I'm right handed so, you know,\n\n207\n00:10:07.384 --> 00:10:11.800\nI'll have my hand on the steering wheel,\nI might grab the phone with my right hand.\n\n208\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.930\nAnd I can't finger unlock it with one hand\nbecause I just did my index finger and\n\n209\n00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.000\nI quickly realized that you'll want\nto program more than one finger.\n\n210\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.790\nAnd most of them do support that.\n\n211\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.625\nAnd so for me I did both my index\nfingers and my thumbs because if you're\n\n212\n00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.885\ndoing it one handed,\nyou want to be able to use your thumb.\n\n213\n00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:30.545\nSo you may want to do\nmore than one finger,\n\n214\n00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:33.465\nand it also allows you to\ndo other people's fingers.\n\n215\n00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:34.935\nSo, for example, my wife.\n\n216\n00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.740\nI want my wife to be able to use my phone.\n\n217\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.310\nAnd, I could always tell her\nwhat the code is, you know?\n\n218\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.090\nShe knows.\n\n219\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.840\nBut, I just programmed her finger in, too.\n\n220\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.010\nThat way, she can unlock the phone and\nit's now, either one of us can use it.\n\n221\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.870\nSo, it's not so much,\nprogramming in just a single fingerprint.\n\n222\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.050\nYou can do more than one.\n\n223\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.460\nAnd, that's a good idea because you might,\nyou might get a cut on your finger and\n\n224\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.040\nnow, your fingerprint won't register.\n\n225\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.650\nAnd, that you know, creates the,\nthe challenge of getting into the phone.\n\n226\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.540\nAnd, that's where the backup\ncode comes in handy.\n\n227\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.030\nSo those are some of the different ways\nof securing that and let me just show you\n\n228\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.180\nsome of the other security settings\nthat we might have on a phone.\n\n229\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.460\nI'm gonna bring my phone up here on\nthe screen, let me just fire this up.\n\n230\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.805\nI'm gonna air play my phone.\n\n231\n00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:15.700\nOkay, so this is my cell phone and\n\n232\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.480\nI just wanna show some of\nthe security settings I've got.\n\n233\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.420\nThis is a, a Apple iPhone 5s, and\nthe settings are gonna be a little bit\n\n234\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.290\ndifferent as you move between vendors, so\non Samsung and, and you know, Google, or\n\n235\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.820\nwhoever, HTC, Motorola the, the settings\nmight be in different places, right.\n\n236\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.790\nBut the settings are basically the same.\n\n237\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.970\nIf you go into the settings for\n\n238\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.210\nyour device, you'll normally have\nan area that's labeled as security.\n\n239\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.790\nNow Apple likes to call theirs privacies,\nyou'll see some privacy settings.\n\n240\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.550\nAnd then I've got touch ID and\npass code right there.\n\n241\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.470\nAnd I can choose that to go in, and\nit just ask me to punch in my pass code,\n\n242\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.390\njust to get in to these settings.\n\n243\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.790\nSo, I, I've already got a code,\nwhich I have set to one, two, three,\n\n244\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.110\nfour just for the show.\n\n245\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.770\nBut, once I go in here, here's where I\ncan start to turn things on and off.\n\n246\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.370\nAnd some of the things that we're going\nto want to set are things like whether or\n\n247\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.380\nnot we want to use touch ID.\n\n248\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.980\nSo here you can see I've turned\non touch ID for my iPhone unlock.\n\n249\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.040\nSo just to unlock the phone,\njust to be able to open it up and\n\n250\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.130\nuse it,\nI would need to provide a fingerprint.\n\n251\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.260\nOkay, and then right here's where I can\nprogram in my different fingerprints and\n\n252\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.300\nyou can see I have\nprogrammed in five fingers.\n\n253\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.560\nI did four of mine and,\nand one of my wife's.\n\n254\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.770\nBut I can add more fingerprints if\nnecessary to allow other people\n\n255\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.100\nto unlock the phone, or, or\n\n256\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.930\nif I just need to program other\nof my fingers I can do it there.\n\n257\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.240\nThe passcode, I can turn that on and off.\n\n258\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.570\nNow I do have a passcode and\nthat's important because if for\n\n259\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.500\nsome reason my fingerprint doesn't work,\nI wanna have a backup plan right?\n\n260\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.860\nSo I've got the passcode.\n\n261\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.620\nI could turn off the fingerprint,\nand just use a passcode if I want.\n\n262\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.840\nWell, pass codes are fairly small and\nthey can be guessed, and so\n\n263\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.330\nyou do worry about that.\n\n264\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.910\nI still use mine as a backup.\n\n265\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.540\nSo I can turn it off there or\nI can go in and change it.\n\n266\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.330\nAnd if I want to change it,\nit's just gonna ask me to pick a new\n\n267\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.620\nfour digit pass code right there and\nI can punch one in.\n\n268\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.760\nI'll just cancel that.\n\n269\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.250\nAll right, some of the other\nthings require a pass code.\n\n270\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.770\nNormally, when you lock your phone,\nit will immediately\n\n271\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.620\nrequire you to provide a password\nif you turn it right back on again.\n\n272\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.820\nSo maybe you're reading a webpage, and you\nhaven't touched your phone in a minute and\n\n273\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.790\nit goes to sleep.\n\n274\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.520\nAnd you just really quick hit the power\nbutton to turn it back on again,\n\n275\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.760\nit's gonna immediately ask you for\nthat passcode.\n\n276\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.500\nSome people like to set a delay,\nyou can set it to say 30 seconds.\n\n277\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.800\nSo if the phone just turned off,\nwait 30 seconds before asking for\n\n278\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.550\na pass code again.\n\n279\n00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.505\nAnd that will give you a little bit of,\nof leeway there as far as waking it up and\n\n280\n00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:39.780\nnot having to put the code in.\n\n281\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.010\nBut it does weaken the security,\n\n282\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.480\nthe longer that delay is\nthe weaker your security becomes.\n\n283\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.410\nWe've got other options here like\nthe simple passcode I have turned on.\n\n284\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.970\nIt's a four digit number.\n\n285\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.040\nIf I turn that off,\nI can do a complex passcode.\n\n286\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.420\nIt's not so much a code anymore,\nas a password.\n\n287\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.280\nLetters, numbers,\nyou can do long strings if you want.\n\n288\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.220\nBut most phones default\nto the four digit number.\n\n289\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.210\nAlright.\n\n290\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.870\nAnd then the rest of this is just stating\nthings that you can do while the phone is\n\n291\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.180\nlocked So, if the phone is locked,\nmost systems,\n\n292\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.520\nmost cell phones,\nwill still allow you to dial 911.\n\n293\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.850\nSo, on a locked phone screen, you'll see\na message that'll say, emergency dial.\n\n294\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.960\nBut it won't let you\nmake other phone calls.\n\n295\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.690\nOn the iPhone, you'll see there's\nactually a lot of stuff we can do when\n\n296\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.400\nthe phone is locked.\n\n297\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.910\nAnd this might not be something we want.\n\n298\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.500\nIn fact, I didn't realize\nI had all these turned on.\n\n299\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.980\nSo I probably don't want a lot\nof this stuff turned on.\n\n300\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:36.310\nI don't want to do Siri, or, or you know,\nI don't want to show my calendar.\n\n301\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.280\nIf somebody gets my phone,\nthey can't unlock it, but\n\n302\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.010\nby default they can see my calendar,\nand my recent emails and\n\n303\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.820\ntext messages that show upright\nthere on the lock screen.\n\n304\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.830\nI might not want that.\n\n305\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.560\nSome people really do like that,\nthat quick at a glance view.\n\n306\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.090\nWhere you can see those things.\n\n307\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.100\nAnd so you might wanna turn that on and,\nand leave it on.\n\n308\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.470\nSome people don't.\n\n309\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.940\nThey don't wanna show those items\nwithout unlocking the phone.\n\n310\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.740\nSo it depends on how\nsensitive your data is.\n\n311\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.830\nYou might wanna turn this data off.\n\n312\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.960\n&gt;&gt; It's that last option there, Don,\nthat, that would kinda frighten me.\n\n313\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.733\n&gt;&gt; Reply with Message?\n\n314\n00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:09.868\nNow, that one's actually\nnot as bad as it sounds.\n\n315\n00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:14.220\nIn, in the iPhone you can define\nsome pre-determined messages.\n\n316\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.170\nAnd people can reply with\nyour pre-determined message.\n\n317\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.770\nSo they, they wouldn't be able to type a\nmessage, but they could pick some of your,\n\n318\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.690\nyour precanned ones.\n\n319\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.120\nAnd you might have some that\nare appropriate for some people and\n\n320\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.735\nnot appropriate for others,\nread that as you will.\n\n321\n00:15:25.735 --> 00:15:29.275\nAnd so you know, they could actually\ncreate an embarrassing moment right there.\n\n322\n00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:31.925\nIf they chose one that was not prepared.\n\n323\n00:15:31.925 --> 00:15:34.275\n&gt;&gt; No, it was that very last option,\nerase data.\n\n324\n00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:35.035\n&gt;&gt; That was,\n&gt;&gt; After 10.\n\n325\n00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:35.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:36.445\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one.\n\n327\n00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:42.575\nBy default here, if I get it wrong,\nit's just gonna make me enter it again.\n\n328\n00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:46.274\nBut if I turn that on and we get it\nwrong ten times, erase the phone.\n\n329\n00:15:46.274 --> 00:15:50.700\nIf you've got sensitive data on your phone\nand you're concerned about that, you,\n\n330\n00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.123\nyou know you don't want it to leak out,\nyou need to turn that on and\n\n331\n00:15:54.123 --> 00:15:58.015\nthat way somebody's trying to guess\nyour phone pass code and it wipes it.\n\n332\n00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.842\nBut if you have kids?\n\n333\n00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:01.987\nThen it's not the greatest\nthing to have turned on.\n\n334\n00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:04.997\nSo, so, those are some of\nthe different security options.\n\n335\n00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:08.110\nDifferent phones have different options,\nso you may have more than that.\n\n336\n00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.650\nYou may have less than that.\n\n337\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.960\nBut usually these are pretty standard for\nthe type of options that we see.\n\n338\n00:16:14.512 --> 00:16:18.220\nAll right there is another area, where\nwe need to be aware of with security.\n\n339\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.100\nIf someone physically gets your phone,\nthey can jump in there and\n\n340\n00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.510\ntry to gain access to what's on it.\n\n341\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.060\nYour email accounts and so on.\n\n342\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.670\nWhat if they don't have\nphysical access to their phone?\n\n343\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.670\nThere are several known exploits\nout there that can use Bluetooth.\n\n344\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.900\nIf you're not familiar with Bluetooth,\nit's a wireless technology that allows\n\n345\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.360\nyour phone to communicate with\nother devices wirelessly.\n\n346\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.150\nAnd you can use it,\nlike I use it with my car.\n\n347\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.420\nYou'll see my, my Elantra right there,\nthat's, that's my car.\n\n348\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.060\nAnd, so when I get in the car,\nif you call me on the phone,\n\n349\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.510\nthe car speakers will ring and there's\na microphone in the roof above my head and\n\n350\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.810\nthat's what I can talk to, so\nI have hands free calling, right.\n\n351\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.810\nI also tether with other\nthings like my iPad.\n\n352\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.990\nThat's that first entry.\n\n353\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.530\nSo I can do data plan tethering.\n\n354\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.730\nI don't have a data plan for my iPad,\nI share the one for the phone.\n\n355\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.040\nSo you can have devices like that.\n\n356\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.930\nWell people can attach to your\nsystem with a laptop or, or\n\n357\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.090\nsomething else to try and gain access\nto your phone, so there's some attacks,\n\n358\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.160\nit's called bluesnarfing and so\nwe wanna make sure that we secure that.\n\n359\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160\nWhen you pair a device right.\n\n360\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.880\nSo Ronnie, why don't you try and\npair with my phone?\n\n361\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.590\nSo Ronnie's trying to pair with\nmy phone right now from his.\n\n362\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.190\nAnd it's gonna reach out to mine.\n\n363\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.330\nAnd when he starts to communicate,\nI get this message.\n\n364\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.440\nI'm getting a connection\nfrom a Samsung phone, right.\n\n365\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.020\nSo that's Ronnie's Galaxy S5 and it says\ndo I want to pair and it's showing a code.\n\n366\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.870\nAll right, first off if I don't know\nwhat this is, I can just hit cancel and\n\n367\n00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.750\nthat's that, right?\n\n368\n00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.990\nI'm not connected.\n\n369\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.040\nBut if I, if I knew this was gonna happen,\nyeah, I wanna pair with Ronnie's phone,\n\n370\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.800\nwell somebody else could have a Galaxy S5\nand be doing this at the same time.\n\n371\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.690\nHow do I know this is actually Ronnie?\n\n372\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.360\nWell it's showing a code, 344075.\n\n373\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.450\nI can look at his screen and\nwhat do you got Ronnie?\n\n374\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.800\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n344, yeah, 075.\n\n375\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.520\n&gt;&gt; So I know this is actually his phone.\n\n376\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.620\nAnd then I can hit OK.\n\n377\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.950\nI, I took too long.\n\n378\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.480\nBut I can hit okay and they'll pair up.\n\n379\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.550\nLet, let's try that again, Ronnie.\n\n380\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.980\nI, I just, I waited too long.\n\n381\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.525\n&gt;&gt; I went for the wrong, wrong, device.\n\n382\n00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:12.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it does timeout.\n\n383\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.940\nBut, but you can get that and you confirm\nit and then the phones will be paired.\n\n384\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.100\nAnd since these are two phones,\n\n385\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.130\nall it's gonna allow me to\ndo is just to share files.\n\n386\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.010\nI can copy photos over to his phone or,\nor whatever.\n\n387\n00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.940\nSo we can initiate those transfers.\n\n388\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.910\nThat security code is a safety mechanism.\n\n389\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.500\nYou have to be careful.\n\n390\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.000\nThere's a lot of devices, like my car,\nwhere it says the code is 0000.\n\n391\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.760\nWell, that's terrible that they do that\nbecause I don't really know, is it my car\n\n392\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.460\nI'm connecting to or is it another\nElantra sitting here in the parking lot?\n\n393\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.720\nIt's not a rare car by any means, so\n\n394\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.380\nit could be somebody else's vehicle that\nI'm trying to pair to and I don't know it.\n\n395\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.020\nSo we do need to verify that code.\n\n396\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.510\nYou'll see I got\na different code this time.\n\n397\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.700\nAnd I'll pair up, and now I'll be\nconnected to Ronnie's phone and\n\n398\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.080\nI can start to share files or images\nover with you and there we go, right?\n\n399\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.460\nSo that, that's a part of that process.\n\n400\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.550\nAnd if we're getting rid of that device,\nRonnie comes to me and says hey, Don,\n\n401\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.890\nI, I'm getting a new phone so\nI'm selling that one on Ebay.\n\n402\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.750\nI need to come right back in here and find\nhis phone, so I'll find his Samsung and\n\n403\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.810\nI can pull it up and\nI can forget the device and\n\n404\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.798\nthat's gonna break the pairing and\nI'm no longer tied to it.\n\n405\n00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:22.290\nNow yours, Ronnie, you'll still have\nthat connection and yours will try and\n\n406\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.140\npair to my phone and you're gonna get fail\nmessages and I'm gonna get alert messages.\n\n407\n00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.270\nSo we need to forget it on the other side,\ntoo.\n\n408\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.150\nAnd yours, it's called unpair.\n\n409\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.260\nSo on, on Android they call it unpair.\n\n410\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.360\nHere on Apple they're,\nthey're calling it forget.\n\n411\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.310\nRight?\nThe same, same basic functionality.\n\n412\n00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.290\nRight?\n\n413\n00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.720\nOne word to the wise.\n\n414\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.010\nThis is when everything is working right.\n\n415\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.730\nBut there are some attacks, there's some\n\n416\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.770\nhacker methods that can be used to\naccess phones that bypass the codes.\n\n417\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.170\nMost phones have been patched for\n\n418\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.430\nthat, like the Apple is really\ngood about patching it.\n\n419\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.250\nAndroid phones.\n\n420\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.290\nI love Android.\n\n421\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.210\nDon't, don't get me wrong.\n\n422\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.490\nOn, I, I really do.\n\n423\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.920\nBut when Google releases an update,\n\n424\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.726\nit's not Google that gets to update your\nphone, it's the phone manufacturers.\n\n425\n00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:11.790\nAnd Samsung, and Motorola,\n\n426\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.200\nand HTC,\nthey're pretty slow to push out updates.\n\n427\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.265\nAnd even when they pushed out the update,\nthen you have to wait on your carrier,\n\n428\n00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:23.030\nAT&amp;T or Verizon or\nwhoever to approve the update and\n\n429\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.280\nit can be months before that actually\ngets patched in the Android world so\n\n430\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.520\nthose vulnerabilities\nhang around a long time.\n\n431\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.250\nSo if you're going to be traveling right,\ngoing to other countries,\n\n432\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.390\ngoing to other cities, and\nyou've got sensitive data on your phone,\n\n433\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.370\nthe best thing to do is\nto turn Bluetooth off.\n\n434\n00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.150\nWhile you're traveling turn Bluetooth off.\n\n435\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.157\nAnd you can even turn your data,\nlike your,\n\n436\n00:20:45.157 --> 00:20:48.593\nyour regular aided 211 wireless networks,\nyou can turn those off too.\n\n437\n00:20:48.593 --> 00:20:52.050\nAnd by just turning it off,\nthat'll ensure that you don't have any,\n\n438\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.270\nany high risks there because\nthose are proximity attacks.\n\n439\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.480\nThey just have to be near you.\n\n440\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.990\nThey don't have to be talking to you.\n\n441\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.510\nThey don't have to hold your phone.\n\n442\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.880\nThey can access it wirelessly and\nthat, that's a big risk.\n\n443\n00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:08.410\nAll right so those are a couple of things\nthat we need to be aware of as far as\n\n444\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.660\nsecurity on our phones.\n\n445\n00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.120\nWe talk a little bit about pass codes and\ntouch ID, we talk about Bluetooth and\n\n446\n00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.750\nsome of it's functionality.\n\n447\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.260\nWe need to talk about\nwireless connections next.\n\n448\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.040\nBut we're a little short on time on this\nsegment, so why don't we stop here and\n\n449\n00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.550\ntake a break and when we get back, we'll\ndive into wireless and, email accounts.\n\n450\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.710\nA couple of other things\nthat are unique to phones.\n\n451\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.200\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n452\n00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.514\n[MUSIC]\n\n453\n00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.279\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n454\n00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.215\nSo in this segment,\n\n455\n00:21:41.215 --> 00:21:45.190\nwe're gonna take a look at some additional\nsettings on wireless and mobile devices.\n\n456\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.828\nAnd, in fact, the very next section is\ngetting connected to a wireless network.\n\n457\n00:21:48.828 --> 00:21:52.410\nMany cell phones, well,\nI guess if you think about it,\n\n458\n00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.550\nevery cell phone is connected to\na wireless network of some sort.\n\n459\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:22:00.120\nMost of them are connected to GSM or\nCDMA based cellular networks.\n\n460\n00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.755\nWhen you buy a Cellular telephone,\nright, a cell phone.\n\n461\n00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:07.235\nThat's what they connect to is\nthat phone company's network.\n\n462\n00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:11.635\nThose networks are not very fast and\nthey typically have data caps on them and\n\n463\n00:22:11.635 --> 00:22:14.835\nso you don't want to go crazy\nusing them if you can avoid it.\n\n464\n00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:19.430\nSo most modern Smartphones will\ncome with regular wi-fi enabled\n\n465\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.910\nadaptors that will let you connect to\ntraditional computer-based wi-fi networks.\n\n466\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.660\nThings that are,\nare under the 802.11 standard.\n\n467\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.200\nSo you hear about, like, 802.11 a, b,\n\n468\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.860\ng, n., all these different wireless\nstandards that are out there.\n\n469\n00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.100\nMost of your cell phones can connect\njust like a laptop or a desktop would.\n\n470\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.740\nRight?\n\n471\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.320\nBut we do need to go in and\ntell them to connect.\n\n472\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.200\nA lot of the phones will do\nit when you first get them,\n\n473\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.190\nbut if it's been a while you\nmight forget and if you're\n\n474\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.430\ntravelling you might want to jump on\na share like a hotel wireless network, so\n\n475\n00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.430\nwe need to be familiar with that\nprocess of adding wireless networks.\n\n476\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n477\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.710\nWhen these devices get set up the first\ntime, when you do it, the nice thing is\n\n478\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.720\nyou are simply following a menu if you\nare going through the initial setup.\n\n479\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.030\nBut if you don't happen to have that,\n\n480\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.750\nmake sure that you can actually figure out\nwhere to go and the majority of times,\n\n481\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.250\non whether you're on the Apple iPhone,\nor whether you go to an Android or\n\n482\n00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.350\na Windows phone, you'll probably see\nsomething that's fairly gonna be familiar.\n\n483\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.860\nGoing from one device to the other,\n\n484\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.160\nand normally we find them underneath\nour settings on the phone itself.\n\n485\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n486\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.900\nAll right, so let's just take a look here,\nand I'll, I'll use an iPhone as an example\n\n487\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.960\nthat, you'll find the process is\nbasically the same for most phones, but\n\n488\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.280\nwe start by going into our phone settings.\n\n489\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.740\nSo I'm going to go into my settings.\n\n490\n00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.170\nNow even before then, you can usually\ntell if you're connected to Wi-Fi or\n\n491\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.840\nnot, because there will be a little\nsymbol up at the top of the screen,\n\n492\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.350\nand you can see on mine, I've got a little\nnote that says AT&amp;T at the top left, and\n\n493\n00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.414\nI've got four out of five circles for\nsignal which actually means nothing.\n\n494\n00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:44.100\nThose things are just\nthere to make you happy.\n\n495\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.000\nBut it makes you feel like\nyou have a good connection.\n\n496\n00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.920\nBut right beside it are those\nthree curved lines.\n\n497\n00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.188\nAnd those are the wi-fi signals.\n\n498\n00:23:50.188 --> 00:23:54.620\nAnd that lets me know I'm not using\nthe cellular network right now for data.\n\n499\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.706\nI'm using a wireless network that's\nprovided here in our studio.\n\n500\n00:23:58.706 --> 00:24:02.582\nAnd if I go into my settings,\nwe'll find buried away in here in our,\n\n501\n00:24:02.582 --> 00:24:05.715\nour various settings Is\nthis section labeled Wi-Fi?\n\n502\n00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:09.610\nAnd there's those same three curved\nlines that, that relates that.\n\n503\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.270\nNow I'm already connected to a network.\n\n504\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.460\nSo it shows it right there, the NH Studio.\n\n505\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.910\nThat's our wireless network.\n\n506\n00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.120\nAnd if I click on that,\nit's actually gonna start doing a scan.\n\n507\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.510\nYour system, your phone or, or tablet for\n\n508\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.680\nthat matter, will be able to look and\nfind wireless networks in the area.\n\n509\n00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.080\nNow you'll usually find a mixture.\n\n510\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.410\nSome of them might be\nnetworks that you own.\n\n511\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.880\nThey might be your neighbors.\n\n512\n00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.510\nIf you are travelling in an airport,\nyou might see other, other people or\n\n513\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.230\nother businesses in the area.\n\n514\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.440\nSo you might see other wireless networks.\n\n515\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.550\nThat doesn't mean you\nare allowed to use them.\n\n516\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.440\nNotice how all of these have\nlittle locks besides them.\n\n517\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.630\nThat lets me know that\ntheir password protected,\n\n518\n00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.070\nthat in order to connect I'm going to\nhave to authenticate giving credentials.\n\n519\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.850\nIf there wasn't a lock,\nthen it would be an open network.\n\n520\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.880\nAnybody can connect and\nthat's when you'll see it at Starbuck's or\n\n521\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.330\na restaurant where they\nare offering free wireless.\n\n522\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.590\nAnd it won't usually have a lock and\nactually one just turned up there.\n\n523\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.190\nAn HP printer at Tim's desk.\n\n524\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.180\nSo if we want to start sending random\nprint jobs to his printer we could,\n\n525\n00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.720\nby checking that and\nhonestly we should do that.\n\n526\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.910\nWe should just start\nsending stuff over to Tim.\n\n527\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.850\nSo [LAUGH] but\nyou'll see some other devices.\n\n528\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.430\nThere's Rokus that are on the internet,\nthere's that ASO private and\n\n529\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.700\npublic networks that are setting there.\n\n530\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.850\nIf they are all locked.\n\n531\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.350\nIf I want to connect to any one of them\nI'm gong to have to provide a password.\n\n532\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.240\nSo let's say I wanted connect\nto that private network.\n\n533\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.590\nI could choose that.\n\n534\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.730\nAnd there it's asking for\nthe password, and\n\n535\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.190\nI'll have to punch that\nin to get it connected.\n\n536\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.200\nNow I don't wanna do that right now,\n\n537\n00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.330\ncuz I'm actually sharing my iPhone\nscreen using the wireless, so\n\n538\n00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.430\nif I disconnect I'll, I'll lose my\nconnection to the iPhone, to the WiFi.\n\n539\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.390\nBut you can see I'm,\n\n540\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:47.610\nI'm already connected to a,\na network up here, which is the NH studio.\n\n541\n00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.550\nAnd when you're connected, it'll just\nshow as having a little mark by,\n\n542\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.600\nthat let's you know you're connected,\nyou'll have your three curved bars up in\n\n543\n00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.530\nyour, your status bar at\nthe very top of the screen.\n\n544\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.840\nAnd, if I want to verify\nthat i'm actually connected,\n\n545\n00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.070\nyou can hit the information button to\nthe side, that little i, in a circle.\n\n546\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.030\nI'll hit that and\nit'll tell me about the network.\n\n547\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.815\nYou can see I got an IP\naddress on this network.\n\n548\n00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:14.030\n10.1.230.23 and I got some DNS servers for\ndoing name lookups.\n\n549\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.880\nI got a search domain, so\nI am talking on this network.\n\n550\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.360\nEven if you don't understand\nwhat this information is,\n\n551\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.190\nyou don't have to rely on it.\n\n552\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.990\nYou can just fire up a web browser and\nsee if you can get to the internet.\n\n553\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.530\nRight.\n\n554\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.680\nSo, if I go and fire up a web browser,\nlike I'll fire up Chrome here.\n\n555\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.635\nAnd, let me go to, we'll go to,\nlike, news.google.com.\n\n556\n00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.805\nAnd there we go, I'm browsing,\nI'm out to the internet.\n\n557\n00:26:36.805 --> 00:26:39.815\nSo, I know I'm out and\nrunning using the wireless.\n\n558\n00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:43.405\nIf this didn't work, then I would know\nthat I wasn't actually connected.\n\n559\n00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:47.682\nSo, we can spot that and\nwe're good to go, right.\n\n560\n00:26:47.682 --> 00:26:50.792\nNow, one other caveat,\nwhen you do that scan, right, so\n\n561\n00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:55.342\nwhen I went into Wi-Fi here, it did\na scan and it found those other networks.\n\n562\n00:26:55.342 --> 00:26:56.712\nNow I'll give it just a second there.\n\n563\n00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:59.262\nSo it's gonna do a scan and\nthen it'll turn up.\n\n564\n00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:03.522\nIt is possible that whatever wireless\nnetwork you're trying to join is hidden,\n\n565\n00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:07.880\nright, not everybody broadcasts out\nthe name of their wireless network.\n\n566\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.610\nAnd if that's the case, that's why we\nhave that Other button at the bottom.\n\n567\n00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.170\nYou can click Other and\nit will give you the opportunity for\n\n568\n00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.300\nyou to type in that network name.\n\n569\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.530\nA wireless network name is actually called\na SSID which is Service Set Identifier.\n\n570\n00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.820\nAnd most of the time we\ndon't care about that.\n\n571\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.960\nBut if you go to somewhere where they're\nhiding the network they'll probably have\n\n572\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.560\na little sign or they'll give you a note.\n\n573\n00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.760\nAnd it'll say The SSID is this.\n\n574\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.470\nAnd that's what SSID is, it,\nit's the name of that wireless network.\n\n575\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.610\nSo, you would choose other, and you would\ngo and you would type in the name, and\n\n576\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.600\nthen you would specify the security\npassword to be able to get\n\n577\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.860\nconnected to it.\n\n578\n00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.280\nThat's not very common cuz it,\nif you're a hacker it's actually a very,\n\n579\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.380\nvery small amount of skill to figure\nout a name even though it's hidden.\n\n580\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.080\nSo it's not a great\neffective security measure.\n\n581\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.570\nBut you do see places use that.\n\n582\n00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.940\nSo I just wanted to point that out,\non getting connected to wireless networks.\n\n583\n00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.660\nAll right.\n\n584\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.020\nSo, as far as Wi-Fi connectivity\nthere's not too much else to it, right?\n\n585\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.530\nWe do need to make sure\nour Wi-Fi is turned on.\n\n586\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.570\nYou can turn it off on your phone.\n\n587\n00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.610\nMaybe you turned it off to save battery or\n\n588\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.570\nyou just never used it before so\nit was off.\n\n589\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.640\nSo you might need to turn\nyour Wi-Fi antenna on.\n\n590\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.390\nLet me show you how to\ndo that on my phone.\n\n591\n00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.470\nIf I bring up my status menu,\ndown here at the bottom of the screen,\n\n592\n00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.940\nsah I've got a circular button there\nwith the 3 curved lines on it?\n\n593\n00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.860\nIf I touch that,\nit will turn my wireless off and\n\n594\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.080\nif I touch it again it will turn it on.\n\n595\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.990\nI can do the same thing with bluetooth,\nright beside it, if I touch bluetooth\n\n596\n00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.150\nI just turn my bluetooth antenna off,\nnow I'm no longer speaking using that, and\n\n597\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.470\nI can just turn it right\nback on when I want it.\n\n598\n00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.610\nI would do wireless right now, but again,\nI'd, I'd loose my screen saver, if I did.\n\n599\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.790\nAlso keep in mind that we got\nthe airplane mode right beside that.\n\n600\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.280\nNow what is that?\n\n601\n00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.580\nIf I choose airplane mode,\nit turns off all wireless signal.\n\n602\n00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.090\nSo that's gonna turn off Bluetooth,\nit'll turn off the Wi-Fi, and\n\n603\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.120\nit will turn off the cellular signal.\n\n604\n00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.680\nYou can't make or receive phone calls,\nsend emails, all that stuff is\n\n605\n00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.930\nturned off and that's what we're supposed\nto use while we're in an airplane,\n\n606\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.930\nalthough the rules are starting to\nloosen up quite a bit lately,right.\n\n607\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.300\nBut if we just wanna turn off Wi-Fi,\nor we just wanna turn off Bluetooth,\n\n608\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.920\nthat's where our individual\nbuttons come in.\n\n609\n00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.887\nSo we don't always necessarily\nwant to use airplane mode [LAUGH].\n\n610\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.380\n&gt;&gt; Our next little category that we wanna\nmake sure that we cover on our phones,\n\n611\n00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.900\nis gonna be what I use the phone for\nthe majority of the time, which is for\n\n612\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.240\nchecking e-mail.\n\n613\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.000\nSince I do have three different accounts,\n\n614\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.680\nI want them all to be able to,\nto land on my, my phone.\n\n615\n00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.430\nAnd so we want to make sure we know how\nto set up an email account on our phones.\n\n616\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for the most part,\nthe phones work the same, and again,\n\n617\n00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.680\nI'm going to show on an iPhone, but it is\nbasically the same process for Android.\n\n618\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.540\nWhen you go to add an email\naccount to your phone,\n\n619\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:57.610\nyour phone will typically have support\nbuilt in for the major email providers.\n\n620\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.960\nAnd if you've got service through\none of those major email service\n\n621\n00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.180\nproviders it's super easy.\n\n622\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.370\nLet me show you.\n\n623\n00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:06.670\nSo on my phone here I'm going to jump into\nmy settings all alright, and i'm just\n\n624\n00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.400\ngoing to scroll down here, now on an\nAndroid phone your looking for accounts.\n\n625\n00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.890\nBut on the iPhone,\n\n626\n00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:18.430\nwe're actually looking for, mail,\ncontacts, and calendars, all right?\n\n627\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.000\nOnce you go in there,\nnow they kinda get to be the same.\n\n628\n00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.660\nOn Android, you can come in and\nadd new accounts and\n\n629\n00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.500\nhere on iPhone I've got a big add\naccount button right there and\n\n630\n00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.280\nI can punch that in and you see I've\nalready got a couple of accounts.\n\n631\n00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.930\nYou can have more than one account!\n\n632\n00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.210\nI've got my work account.\n\n633\n00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.890\nDon at entertainment live dot com.\n\n634\n00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.080\nRight.\nThat's my work one.\n\n635\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.540\nIf you send me an email at Don at IT Pro\ndot TV, right, that's where it goes.\n\n636\n00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.680\nEntertainment live is the,\nthe actual company.\n\n637\n00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.130\nAnd then above that I got my personal one,\ndpezget(g) at Gmail dot com.\n\n638\n00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:50.010\nSo I have both on my phone so\nthat I can, I can do both.\n\n639\n00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:54.000\nI can read my personal and my,\nmy work email and, and deal with all that.\n\n640\n00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.930\nAnd I'm also pulling in calendars and\nother things.\n\n641\n00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.800\nSo, for you, even on the Android phone,\nyou do the same thing,\n\n642\n00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.990\nyou just add in multiple accounts.\n\n643\n00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.030\nIn fact, both of those\naccounts are Google accounts.\n\n644\n00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.260\nWe host with Google Apps.\n\n645\n00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.715\nBut if I choose to add an Account,\nit'll display the major providers.\n\n646\n00:31:09.715 --> 00:31:12.955\nAm I adding an iCloud account,\na Microsoft Exchange account,\n\n647\n00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:16.206\nGoogle, Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook.com?\n\n648\n00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:18.465\nOutlook.com is, is also Microsoft.\n\n649\n00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:23.950\nSo, which one do I want to add, and if\nI'm using one of those, I just hit it and\n\n650\n00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.580\non the next screen I put in my user name\nand password and it knows what to do.\n\n651\n00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.560\nBut what if you're not using\none of these [INAUDIBLE].\n\n652\n00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.390\n&gt;&gt; Other.\n\n653\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.030\n&gt;&gt; You've got to go to that other\noption down there at the bottom.\n\n654\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.970\nIt's kind of small, but\nit's down there, the other, and that's\n\n655\n00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.660\nwhere you'd come in and punch in specific\ninformation about another account.\n\n656\n00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.720\nNow when you do this, it does make a\ndifference whether it's an email account,\n\n657\n00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.280\nor whether it's a contacts account,\nor a calendar account.\n\n658\n00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.103\nAnd you'll see some of\nthe different support that's there.\n\n659\n00:31:51.103 --> 00:31:54.873\nMost other solutions don't have\ncalendar and contact sync,\n\n660\n00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:57.054\nso you don't see those very often.\n\n661\n00:31:57.054 --> 00:32:00.915\nBut the first one, Add a Mail Account, is\nthe important one that we normally go to.\n\n662\n00:32:00.915 --> 00:32:01.600\nAll right?\n\n663\n00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.296\nAnd when we're gonna add a mail account,\nit's gonna ask us some basic information.\n\n664\n00:32:05.296 --> 00:32:08.204\nNow, just because it didn't\nhave built in settings,\n\n665\n00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:10.710\ndoesn't mean it can't figure it out.\n\n666\n00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.440\nSo, you punch in your basic information\nhere, name, email, password.\n\n667\n00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.930\nAnd based on that, it will try and\nfigure out your server settings.\n\n668\n00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.300\nAnd a lot of times it does.\n\n669\n00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.383\nRight?\nI'm gonna put some fake stuff in here,\n\n670\n00:32:23.383 --> 00:32:24.940\njust so it, it definitely will fail.\n\n671\n00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.090\nSo, I'm just going to put in, you know,\ntest, and this will be test at test.com.\n\n672\n00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.870\nAnd oops,\nmy little at symbol didn't didn't go.\n\n673\n00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:35.940\nThere we go.\nAnd my password,\n\n674\n00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.640\nI'll just put a fake password in there.\n\n675\n00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.590\nAll right?\n\n676\n00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.869\nAnd so, I'm just,\nI'm just putting junk in here, because I,\n\n677\n00:32:40.869 --> 00:32:42.640\nI want the automatic detection to fail.\n\n678\n00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.340\nIf it succeeds,\nthen it just finishes and it's done and\n\n679\n00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.610\nI don't get to show you\nguys the advanced settings.\n\n680\n00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.250\nSo, I'll hit Next.\n\n681\n00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.020\nNow, it's trying to\nfigure out the account.\n\n682\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.440\nYou might have seen it say\nlooking looking up account.\n\n683\n00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.520\nIf it figures out the settings for\nyou, that's the last you see and\n\n684\n00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.330\nnow you're in your email.\n\n685\n00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.990\nBut if it doesn't,\nyou have to provide the remaining data.\n\n686\n00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.270\nAnd there's three things, or\nreally two things that we need to know.\n\n687\n00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:10.150\nWe need to know our incoming information,\nhow do we receive email?\n\n688\n00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:14.375\nAnd we need to know our outgoing\ninformation, how do we send email?\n\n689\n00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:18.297\nNow, the first half of this screen\nis focused on the receiving email,\n\n690\n00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:19.368\nhow do we receive?\n\n691\n00:33:19.368 --> 00:33:21.500\nAnd there's two main protocols\nthat are out there for this.\n\n692\n00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.442\nThere's IMAP and POP.\n\n693\n00:33:23.442 --> 00:33:25.020\nAll right?\n\n694\n00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.970\nIMAP, help me out here Ronnie,\nis that internet mail?\n\n695\n00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.144\n&gt;&gt; Messaging.\n\n696\n00:33:28.144 --> 00:33:29.363\n&gt;&gt; Internet messaging and-.\n\n697\n00:33:29.363 --> 00:33:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, access protocol.\n\n698\n00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.010\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n699\n00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n700\n00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Internet messaging access protocol\nis a very old protocol, but it,\n\n701\n00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.190\nit's a good one.\n\n702\n00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.390\nIt works very well.\n\n703\n00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.340\nAnd then, there's POP which\nis the post office protocol.\n\n704\n00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:46.060\nAnd those two are pretty much the de\nfacto standards for receiving email.\n\n705\n00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.590\nNow, what's the difference?\n\n706\n00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.680\nIf your provider only\nsupports one of them,\n\n707\n00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.710\nyou don't care what the difference is.\n\n708\n00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.490\nYou have to use the one they tell you.\n\n709\n00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.940\nSo, if they say we only support POP,\nyou've gotta pick that.\n\n710\n00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.770\nOr if they say they only support IMAP,\nyou've gotta pick that, you're,\n\n711\n00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.920\nyou're kind of at their mercy, right?\n\n712\n00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.050\nBut if they support both,\nhere's the difference.\n\n713\n00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:09.050\nWith POP, when you receive a new email,\nthe default functionality is it will\n\n714\n00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:14.500\ndownload the email to your device and\nremove it from the server.\n\n715\n00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.049\nYou can change it to leave\na copy on the server.\n\n716\n00:34:17.049 --> 00:34:20.198\nBut now, every time you receive an email,\nit will download the entire email and\n\n717\n00:34:20.198 --> 00:34:21.426\nyou'll have two copies of it.\n\n718\n00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:22.389\nAll right?\n\n719\n00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:26.040\nIMAP, on the other hand,\ndoesn't download the whole email.\n\n720\n00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.630\nIt just downloads the header.\n\n721\n00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.080\nSo, you see you got a new email.\n\n722\n00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.290\nYou see the subject line,\nbut it's left on the server.\n\n723\n00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.240\nAnd when you leave the email,\nthen it downloads the body and\n\n724\n00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.830\nyou see the actual message\ninside of the email.\n\n725\n00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.090\nIt's more bandwidth efficient cuz\nyou're only downloading emails\n\n726\n00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.600\nwhen you actually read them.\n\n727\n00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.720\nAnd when you read it on one device,\nit synchronizes with the server.\n\n728\n00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.750\nSo, if you have more than one device,\nthey all know that email has been read.\n\n729\n00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:54.630\nSo, POP was designed back in the day\nwhen people only had one computer.\n\n730\n00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.485\nAnd it doesn't really scale well, if you\nhave more than one thing that you check\n\n731\n00:34:57.485 --> 00:35:00.630\nyour email from, your desktop and\nyour phone, and your tablet, and so on.\n\n732\n00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.010\nBut IMAP does.\n\n733\n00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.341\nSo, generally, you will want IMAP.\n\n734\n00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:08.180\nIMAP also supports folders, so\nif you use folders to organize your email,\n\n735\n00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.420\nit will do it just fine.\n\n736\n00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.980\nPOP does not.\n\n737\n00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.700\nNo foldering support inside of POP.\n\n738\n00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.310\nSo, once you figure out\nwhich one you're gonna use,\n\n739\n00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:22.060\nyou have to put the server name, and\nthis will be the IMAP or the POP3 server.\n\n740\n00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.570\nYou put your username and your password.\n\n741\n00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.260\nAnd you get those from your mail provider.\n\n742\n00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.865\nWhoever your mail provider is, they'll\ngive you that server name, username, and\n\n743\n00:35:29.865 --> 00:35:30.389\npassword.\n\n744\n00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:38.680\nOn the outgoing side, well, POP and IMAP\nare for incoming email, for receiving.\n\n745\n00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.390\nFor sending,\n\n746\n00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.700\nwe use a different service called SMTP,\nthe Simple Mail Transport Protocol.\n\n747\n00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.060\nAnd it's for sending only.\n\n748\n00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.080\nAnd so, whoever your mail provider is\nwill tell you the SMTP credentials.\n\n749\n00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.240\nThe, the server name,\nthe username, and the password.\n\n750\n00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.380\nNow, there is no other choice.\n\n751\n00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.170\nWhen you send email, SMTP is the standard.\n\n752\n00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.910\nSo, it's not like we\nhave to decide something.\n\n753\n00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.990\nThey will give you an SMTP server to use.\n\n754\n00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.850\nSo, you punch that data in, and\nonce it's done you hit Next, it'll\n\n755\n00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.570\ntest the connection to the server, and\nthen, your email account will be added.\n\n756\n00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.870\nNow, another thing to note,\nthese services right here,\n\n757\n00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:22.240\nI got email coming in right here,\na Dollar Shave Club, so important stuff.\n\n758\n00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.080\nSo, these services right here,\n\n759\n00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.290\nthis is if we're using the built\nin email client on your system.\n\n760\n00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:28.920\nAll right?\nSo,\n\n761\n00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.190\nif I wanted to use Apple's mail client,\nthat's where I would punch this in.\n\n762\n00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.990\nOkay?\n\n763\n00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.230\nBut if I go back to, like my accounts.\n\n764\n00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.040\nBack here,\nnotice how none of my accounts say mail?\n\n765\n00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.080\nI actually haven't added\nmail to my accounts.\n\n766\n00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.070\nBut I just got an email.\n\n767\n00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.330\nHow did that happen?\n\n768\n00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.940\nWell, I use a third party mail client,\nbecause the,\n\n769\n00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.180\nthe Apple one, it, it's nice enough,\nbut if you're like me and\n\n770\n00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.100\nyou have a ton of email accounts,\nit, it doesn't work very well.\n\n771\n00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.190\nIt, it doesn't like you to have\nmore than one email account.\n\n772\n00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.078\nSo, for me I use a third party client.\n\n773\n00:37:01.078 --> 00:37:03.537\nI use a, a client called Mailbox.\n\n774\n00:37:03.537 --> 00:37:05.149\nThat's this one down here at the bottom,\n\n775\n00:37:05.149 --> 00:37:07.520\nwhich is actually from\na company called Dropbox.\n\n776\n00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.250\nAnd the Mailbox application handles\nmultiple emails really well.\n\n777\n00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.160\nIt does some neat stuff.\n\n778\n00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.710\nSo, I like that, but by all means,\nyou do not have to use that.\n\n779\n00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.897\nYou could choose your own.\n\n780\n00:37:17.897 --> 00:37:18.917\nIf you're on android,\n\n781\n00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:22.170\nthere's a ton of great email\nclients over there like K-9 mail.\n\n782\n00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.750\nOn iOS, you can use the,\nthe built in Apple mail or\n\n783\n00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.550\nyou can use other ones like this.\n\n784\n00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.650\nIt, it's up to you to\nfind the one you want.\n\n785\n00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.330\nBut if you use a third party mail client,\n\n786\n00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.120\nyou have to add the account\ninside of that client.\n\n787\n00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.150\nSo, you go into that software settings and\nyou add your accounts there.\n\n788\n00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.120\nThat's why none of my accounts\nshows having mail on those screens.\n\n789\n00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.780\nBecause it's not handling mail that way.\n\n790\n00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.688\nSo-.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times, if you're not sure and\n\n791\n00:37:45.688 --> 00:37:47.199\nyou're trying to manually set up and\n\n792\n00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:51.000\nyou're still getting confused, you may\nhave to go and retrieve those settings.\n\n793\n00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.510\nSo, what I normally do is I,\nI recommend somebody go to that website.\n\n794\n00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.782\nSo, for example, like Gmail,\nif you go to their website and\n\n795\n00:37:57.782 --> 00:38:00.440\ntell, tell them you're trying\nto set up a Gmail account\n\n796\n00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.092\nyou'll actually end up\nseeing those settings there.\n\n797\n00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:05.480\nIf, I don't know if got my\nscreen share back on or not.\n\n798\n00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.670\nI may not.\n\n799\n00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.198\nNope it did not turn on.\n\n800\n00:38:08.198 --> 00:38:09.591\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; What are you trying to show, Ronnie?\n\n801\n00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:10.783\n&gt;&gt; I was just trying to show the,\n\n802\n00:38:10.783 --> 00:38:13.644\nthe getting started just some\nof the settings there, so-.\n\n803\n00:38:13.644 --> 00:38:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I can, I can pull it up, so-\n&gt;&gt; Don may be able to pull it up.\n\n804\n00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.790\n&gt;&gt; There's Gmail, let's see-.\n\n805\n00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:17.312\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n806\n00:38:17.312 --> 00:38:18.950\n&gt;&gt; IMAP, POP3, getting started.\n\n807\n00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.640\nSo, you know, I,\nI mentioned that the providers,\n\n808\n00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.776\nproviders will give you\ninformation to get connected.\n\n809\n00:38:24.776 --> 00:38:26.210\nAnd so, that's what Ronnie has pulled up.\n\n810\n00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.641\nI'll, I'll pull it on my screen.\n\n811\n00:38:27.641 --> 00:38:28.961\nYou know what, I guess I need the-.\n\n812\n00:38:28.961 --> 00:38:29.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n813\n00:38:29.495 --> 00:38:30.370\n&gt;&gt; I need to get mine connected.\n\n814\n00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.820\nLet me drop my phone here.\n\n815\n00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo, with, with these settings,\n\n816\n00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:37.107\nright, sometimes when you're setting them\nup or you get a bit, bit confused and,\n\n817\n00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:40.820\nor you may get an error message that's\ntelling you you're not connected.\n\n818\n00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.020\nGoing to the provider itself and trying to\nfigure out what those settings are, and\n\n819\n00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.650\nthen, making sure that they match up to\nthe way they want is actually gonna help.\n\n820\n00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.800\nGmail is very helpful.\n\n821\n00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.010\nSometimes they also have\na a little YouTube video.\n\n822\n00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.572\nBut if not, they at least they have those\nsettings correct so that can verify and\n\n823\n00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:57.503\ncheck if everything is actually working.\n\n824\n00:38:57.503 --> 00:38:58.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n825\n00:38:58.415 --> 00:39:01.630\nAnd, and where you get that information\ndoes vary from provider to provider.\n\n826\n00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:09.120\nSo, if you're using if you're using\nGmail or Outlook.com, or whatever,\n\n827\n00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.910\nyou can go into their help file and\nthey'll have a lot of that information.\n\n828\n00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:16.240\nIf you're using a local ISP,\nyou'll go to their website.\n\n829\n00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.230\nSo, this is the Gmail on right here, and\n\n830\n00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.730\nI just pulled up their getting\nstarted with IMAP and POP3.\n\n831\n00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.820\nYou'll see where they explain\nthe difference between POP and IMAP,\n\n832\n00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.720\nhow much does it cost, which for them it's\nfree you know, what's the difference.\n\n833\n00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.470\nHow will my client use it?\n\n834\n00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:29.510\nAnd then, you tell them what you're doing.\n\n835\n00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:34.070\nSo, if you say, I wanna enable IMAP, they\nthen proceed to give you the information\n\n836\n00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.670\nfor setting it up, and I can tell them\nI've got I'll do an Android phone.\n\n837\n00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.500\nSo, I've got an Android phone and\nit starts to tell me what to do.\n\n838\n00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.730\nHere's the server to use, imap.gmail.com,\n\n839\n00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.814\nand the port number and\nSSL, those settings.\n\n840\n00:39:46.814 --> 00:39:49.438\nIf the phone asks you for\nthose, you can specify them.\n\n841\n00:39:49.438 --> 00:39:52.258\nAnd then, smtp.gmail.com.\n\n842\n00:39:52.258 --> 00:39:54.424\nAnd so,\nyou'll find those settings right in there.\n\n843\n00:39:54.424 --> 00:39:58.750\nIf you're using something\nlike Outlook.com.\n\n844\n00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.414\nLet's see if we can find the settings for\nthese.\n\n845\n00:40:02.414 --> 00:40:03.866\nSo you can go to them.\n\n846\n00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:08.980\nAnd on the Outlook.com page, oops, that is\nnot Outlook.com, that's some third party.\n\n847\n00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.230\nI like to pull the official\npage whenever possible.\n\n848\n00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.600\nHere we go.\n\n849\n00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.930\nGood old Microsoft.\n\n850\n00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.120\nSo we can go in here and\n\n851\n00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.170\nthey'll explain how to get that setup as\nfar as what settings to use and so on.\n\n852\n00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.970\n&gt;&gt; And that first little point.\n\n853\n00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:23.770\nYeah, there you go.\n\n854\n00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.510\nIs there a phone, right?\n\n855\n00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.515\n&gt;&gt; And if we drill down in here somewhere,\nwe will find the server name.\n\n856\n00:40:28.515 --> 00:40:30.920\nActually if I scrolled past it right here.\n\n857\n00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.750\nSo like here, for server name,\nfor SMTP, it's s.outlook.com.\n\n858\n00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.450\nRight?\nSo they're telling us that server name.\n\n859\n00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.975\nAnd I must have scrolled passed the\nincoming, but but basically they specify\n\n860\n00:40:41.975 --> 00:40:44.230\nthat they give you that information,\nthat's where you get it from.\n\n861\n00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.612\nIt is different for each provider so\nit may be mail.whatever.com,\n\n862\n00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:51.636\nhere it's s.whatever.com, so it does\nvary and that's why you've got to go and\n\n863\n00:40:51.636 --> 00:40:53.699\ncheck with that documentation, right.\n\n864\n00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:56.565\nBut just keep in mind that\nyou can set that up, Imap and\n\n865\n00:40:56.565 --> 00:40:59.067\nPOP, those are the two\nreceiving protocols.\n\n866\n00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:03.430\nAnd SMTP, that's the one sending protocol,\nso be aware of those.\n\n867\n00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.132\nAll right, what else is on our\nlaundry list here, Ronnie?\n\n868\n00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.980\nWe got screen orientation.\n\n869\n00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.681\nWith a desktop or a laptop, your,\n\n870\n00:41:13.681 --> 00:41:18.200\nyour on screen display is always\ngoing to be the same, right.\n\n871\n00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.880\nWe, we what's called\na a 16 by 9 resolution.\n\n872\n00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.770\nThings kind of run side by side,\nbut let me,\n\n873\n00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.400\nlet me switch over to my cell phone and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n874\n00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.700\nI'm gonna disconnect\nmy desktop real quick.\n\n875\n00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.880\nSo here's my cellphone.\n\n876\n00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.010\nOn a desktop, the screen is always\nwider than it is tall, right, so\n\n877\n00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:40.080\nit'll be, it'll be much more wide than\nthe height of the screen so it has,\n\n878\n00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.000\nit's what they call an aspect ratio,\nright.\n\n879\n00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, landscape board versus\nportrait something like that.\n\n880\n00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's, you'll see four\nby three versus 16 by 9, you know,\n\n881\n00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.460\nit's all about the width being\ngreater than the height.\n\n882\n00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.560\nBut on a cell phone,\nit's usually the opposite.\n\n883\n00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.740\nIt's normally taller than it is wide.\n\n884\n00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.070\nAnd so, if you look at my phone,\nthat's exactly what I've got here.\n\n885\n00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:03.420\nIt's a tall screen layout and\nit's not very wide at all.\n\n886\n00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.305\nSo when we go to things\nlike websites like these,\n\n887\n00:42:06.305 --> 00:42:10.085\nthey're trying to cram into a very\nsmall amount of space, right?\n\n888\n00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:13.145\nThey're just trying to get as much\ninformation in as they can in that small\n\n889\n00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:14.235\nspace.\n\n890\n00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:17.095\nBut if you turn your phone sideways,\nwhat happens?\n\n891\n00:42:17.095 --> 00:42:17.735\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n892\n00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:20.770\n&gt;&gt; The orientation changes and well,\nit blew up to fill my whole screen.\n\n893\n00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So so the orientation changes and\n\n894\n00:42:23.695 --> 00:42:26.455\nnow they can get a lot\nmore information in.\n\n895\n00:42:26.455 --> 00:42:29.280\nAnd this webpage, CNN's,\ndidn't change much.\n\n896\n00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.840\nBut sometimes you'll see web pages\nchange drastically when they go wider.\n\n897\n00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.336\nSo when it's narrow, like this, you may\nsee a very small amount of information,\n\n898\n00:42:38.336 --> 00:42:41.351\nand there we go, sorry,\nit wasn't scrolling for me.\n\n899\n00:42:41.351 --> 00:42:44.068\nAnd so you might see a very\nsmall amount of information and\n\n900\n00:42:44.068 --> 00:42:47.578\nthen you turn it sideways and all of\nthe sudden it adds additional things,\n\n901\n00:42:47.578 --> 00:42:50.485\nnew buttons show up and, and\nso on all based on that.\n\n902\n00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:53.805\nAnd you have websites that are,\nthey're called responsive websites.\n\n903\n00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:55.595\nActually our,\nour website is like that, right?\n\n904\n00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:58.335\nBut, I, I don't think this screen\nwill be wide enough to show it.\n\n905\n00:42:58.335 --> 00:43:02.737\nIf I go to itpro.tv,\njust fire up our website, .tb,\n\n906\n00:43:02.737 --> 00:43:06.962\nit's our new tuberculosis\nawareness website.\n\n907\n00:43:06.962 --> 00:43:10.755\nIf I go to itpro.tv, there we go,\nso there's our website, and\n\n908\n00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:15.605\nyou'll see how it's kind of laid out\nbased on,on what'll fit on my screen,\n\n909\n00:43:15.605 --> 00:43:20.173\nand if I turn sideways, it'll sense that\nand spread the text out more, and so\n\n910\n00:43:20.173 --> 00:43:24.490\nwe start to have it laid out, and\nwe might see additional options here.\n\n911\n00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.040\nYeah.\nIt still didn't go wide enough to make\n\n912\n00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.520\nthis menu turn normal.\n\n913\n00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.440\nBut once your screen reaches a certain\nwidth, our menu kind of explodes and\n\n914\n00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.750\ntakes up more space.\n\n915\n00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.970\nSo when people develop applications and\n\n916\n00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.650\nweb pages when they're\nconsidering mobile devices,\n\n917\n00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:43.030\nthey have to remember that a mobile\ndevice could be vertical like this or\n\n918\n00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:48.020\nit could be horizontal where now it's got\na greater width than it does a height.\n\n919\n00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.700\nThat's a problem we\ndon't have on desktops,\n\n920\n00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.230\ndesktops you always have\na greater width than a height.\n\n921\n00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.170\nAnd so\nit's not something people plan for, but\n\n922\n00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.910\nit does make things a little\nmore complex for the developers.\n\n923\n00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:02.050\nBut, but that's called screen orientation,\nand they normally call them well Ronnie,\n\n924\n00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.620\nyou said it a second ago,\nbut landscape and portrait.\n\n925\n00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.610\nSo, this is portrait mode,\nwhen it's taller than it is wide, and\n\n926\n00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.170\nlandscape is when it's\nwider than it is tall,\n\n927\n00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.540\nand I always just remember that\nbecause landscape, you know,\n\n928\n00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.960\nyou're like looking out there at the land,\nthe wideness of what's out there, that,\n\n929\n00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.590\nthat's how I always remember that this is\nthe one that is what I consider sideways.\n\n930\n00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.300\nAll right, let's see,\nI already talked about airplane mode,\n\n931\n00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.680\nwhich was the next objective in the list.\n\n932\n00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.500\nAnd the very last one are the stores for\nmobile applications.\n\n933\n00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.090\nThat's probably the biggest difference\nwith our mobile devices is, unlike\n\n934\n00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:42.580\non a PC or a Mac where we just go to a\nwebsite and download the programs we need,\n\n935\n00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.460\non a mobile device we normally get them\nfrom the various app stores, right?\n\n936\n00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:51.250\nAnd Ronnie you got a a graphic that shows\nthe, the three main app stores, right.\n\n937\n00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:55.090\nThese are the three main app stores, why\ndon't you give use the summary, Ronnie.\n\n938\n00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:59.140\n&gt;&gt; So we have an app store for the Apple\ndevices, we have an app store for\n\n939\n00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:04.200\nthe Windows devices and then of course\none for the Android devices too.\n\n940\n00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.570\nNow, we're not worrying about all of the\ndetails overall but, you know, it, it is\n\n941\n00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:14.140\nabout the number of apps that are actually\nin each store, so you can see whereas app,\n\n942\n00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.730\nthe app store and the Google Play store,\nthey have millions of, of apps.\n\n943\n00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.630\nThe Windows Store itself\nis just catching up.\n\n944\n00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:26.125\nThey're, they're right over\na million now as of the end of 2014.\n\n945\n00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:26.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n946\n00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.380\n&gt;&gt; But they're,\nthey're starting to catch up.\n\n947\n00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.510\nI don't think they're ever gonna make\na dent in it like the seven plus million\n\n948\n00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.170\nthat all these other guys have.\n\n949\n00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.620\nAnd the prices of these apps can be free\n\n950\n00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.650\nall the way up until\npretty expensive ones.\n\n951\n00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.870\nAnd the only other thing that I also\nadded in on these, they can range from\n\n952\n00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:46.290\nproductivity, from entertainment-like\ngames, and then to totally useless.\n\n953\n00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.172\nThat's what I found with some of these\nsuper expensive ones that we were talking\n\n954\n00:45:49.172 --> 00:45:52.400\nabout on break is that some of them\njust really don't do anything at all.\n\n955\n00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.876\nThey, they jack up the prices and\n\n956\n00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:56.410\nDon told me later on what\nthey do is they drop price.\n\n957\n00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.577\nAnd Ron goes, Oo,, it's cheaper now.\n\n958\n00:45:58.577 --> 00:45:59.625\nAnd there you go.\n\n959\n00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:00.360\n&gt;&gt; Sale\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n960\n00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.890\nA big gigantic sale.\n\n961\n00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.010\nSo just remember that every single\nphone that you're gonna have,\n\n962\n00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.420\nthey have to go to their app\nstore to be able to get it.\n\n963\n00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.290\nNow are there other app stores out there?\n\n964\n00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.320\nYeah, there are.\n\n965\n00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.060\nBut these are kinda the main three\nthat you generally hear about.\n\n966\n00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.040\nSo the Google Play Store,\nthe Windows Store and\n\n967\n00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.660\nthen the Apple's App Store itself.\n\n968\n00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.340\n&gt;&gt; For the most part they work the same.\n\n969\n00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.050\nFor Apple, they lock you into\nthe app store, the Apple app store.\n\n970\n00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.610\nYou have to get stuff through that store.\n\n971\n00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.600\nFor Android, they have the Google Play\nStore, but you don't have to use it.\n\n972\n00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.360\nYou could choose to download\nyour app from another store.\n\n973\n00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.650\nSo a lot of people install like\nthe Amazon app store and, and use that.\n\n974\n00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.760\nOr, or\nthere's other ones that are out there.\n\n975\n00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.620\nOn the Windows phone, they've pretty much\ngot you locked into the Windows Store but\n\n976\n00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.600\nthey do side-loading of applications.\n\n977\n00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.020\nAnd side-loading just means you\ndownload the application on your,\n\n978\n00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.190\nyour regular computer and\nyou load it onto the phone via USB cable.\n\n979\n00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.230\nSo you can throw it on that way\nwithout using the Windows Store.\n\n980\n00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.280\nSo a little bit of flexibility there.\n\n981\n00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.340\nApple really doesn't allow that except\nif you have a developer account.\n\n982\n00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.900\nThey, they let you do it for testing.\n\n983\n00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.950\nSo some of them are more\nstrict than others.\n\n984\n00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.400\nJust to show you what one of these\nstores looks like here, let's,\n\n985\n00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.490\nlet's pull up the Apple one.\n\n986\n00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.884\nI'm gonna I'm gonna fire this up and.\n\n987\n00:47:09.884 --> 00:47:12.440\nWell I'm not running, well that stinks.\n\n988\n00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; ISo it doesn't have a landscape mode.\n\n989\n00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.590\nI thought it did.\n\n990\n00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:19.240\nSo this is the the Apple Store, and\nwhen I go into the Apple App Store,\n\n991\n00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.180\nbasically you see a lot of like\nbest of applications or, or\n\n992\n00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.030\nwhatever and, and\nyou can find what you're looking for.\n\n993\n00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.670\nIf I want productivity applications right,\nso\n\n994\n00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:34.020\nI can go in here and find that category,\nand then I can start to view applications\n\n995\n00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.510\nthat are available that can help\nme do whatever it is that I want.\n\n996\n00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.690\nSo Evernote, I like Evernote.\n\n997\n00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:42.120\nI might wanna take notes, and\nI can come in here and I can get it.\n\n998\n00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.050\nIf it's free,\nyou'll see that price on there and\n\n999\n00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.320\nyou can just download it, install it.\n\n1000\n00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.350\nAnd, that's it.\n\n1001\n00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.770\nIf it's pay, right?\n\n1002\n00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.350\nWhich, a lot of these have\na price tag attached to them.\n\n1003\n00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.350\nAnd, if they're pay,\n\n1004\n00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:56.570\nyou'll have that option to go in and buy\nthe application for that amount of money.\n\n1005\n00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.870\nNow, one of the best things about\nthese app stores, is not so much,\n\n1006\n00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.910\nthe app store itself, but the fact that\nonce you install it, it updates for you.\n\n1007\n00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.360\nWhen I first launched this app,\n\n1008\n00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.670\nmy little update button was\nlit down there at the bottom.\n\n1009\n00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:12.650\nAnd that meant there\nan update waiting to install.\n\n1010\n00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:13.770\nIt's gone now.\n\n1011\n00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.950\nSo, whatever app that was updated\nin the background while I was\n\n1012\n00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.680\nshowing you guy this, guys this stuff.\n\n1013\n00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:22.060\nSo, as the developers make\ntheir applications better,\n\n1014\n00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.950\nthe app stores automatically update.\n\n1015\n00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:28.690\nSo, sometimes you might have a choice to\nbuy an application through an app store or\n\n1016\n00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.320\ndirectly through the vendor\nvia their website.\n\n1017\n00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.580\nAnd you might still choose\nto go the app store route\n\n1018\n00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.280\nbecause of the automatic updates.\n\n1019\n00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.770\nIf you install any other way, you have\nto manually update the applications,\n\n1020\n00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.990\nand a lot of us don't\npay attention to that.\n\n1021\n00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:46.120\nYou forget about it and you could be\nhaving a problem with an app that's\n\n1022\n00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.020\nalready been fixed in a new update and\nyou just don't know it yet.\n\n1023\n00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.820\nSo that's probably one of the best\nthings about the app stores.\n\n1024\n00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1025\n00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.390\nAnd sometimes these applications will\nallow you to install them on like,\n\n1026\n00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.110\na ton of devices.\n\n1027\n00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.590\nBut then sometimes you go there and\n\n1028\n00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:00.850\nit says it's a limit of five or\nmaybe six devices.\n\n1029\n00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:02.890\nAnd then, when they sense\nsomebody else trying to get in,\n\n1030\n00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.720\nthey'll tell you, here's a limit.\n\n1031\n00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.570\nYou've already installed\nit on five other devices.\n\n1032\n00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.310\nSo, that again means that you have\nremove it on one of those, and\n\n1033\n00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.790\nthen that way you can install\nit again on another device.\n\n1034\n00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.320\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell, Ronnie,\n\n1035\n00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.030\nI think that pretty much runs through\nall the objectives for mobile and\n\n1036\n00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.550\nwireless devices.\n\n1037\n00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.080\n&gt;&gt; You know CompTIA doesn't call out\na whole check of a lot here, but\n\n1038\n00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.210\nthese things are popular.\n\n1039\n00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.860\nSo you need to be familiar with them.\n\n1040\n00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:28.430\nIf you move into an IT career, you will\nbe encountering mobile devices as part of\n\n1041\n00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:32.130\nyour ongoing operation, so\nJust be prepared for it.\n\n1042\n00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.470\nAll right, well, this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap this show.\n\n1043\n00:49:34.470

00:00:38,830\nAnd, welcome back to another\nepisode of ITpro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,000\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,090\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,810\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,990\n>> It is going great.\n\n8\n00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,790\nWe are in, into the IT fundamentals and\nwe're about to go shopping.\n\n9\n00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,510\nSo this is a cool episode for\nus to be able to take a look at some of\n\n10\n00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,710\nthe different hardware components and\nto, to see what we like to buy.\n\n11\n00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,780\nIt is-\n>> Shopping day.\n\n12\n00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,690\n>> It is shopping day.\n\n13\n00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,030\n>> Everybody loves shopping.\n\n14\n00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,280\nSo, we're gonna be jumping into\nObjective 2.1, and the official title is\n\n15\n00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,750\nIdentify Basic Wired and\nWireless Peripherals and their Devices.\n\n16\n00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,360\n>> Wow [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,080\n>> And what they're talking about is,\nwhen you buy a computer,\n\n18\n00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,750\nit's, it's probably great, probably,\nI mean, it could be a piece of junk, but,\n\n19\n00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,659\nbut normally it's a good computer.\n\n20\n00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,720\nBut it might not do all the things\nthat you want it to do.\n\n21\n00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,820\nOr, it might just not do things\nthe exact way you want them to do it.\n\n22\n00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,570\nSo you might need to purchase\nadditional equipment,\n\n23\n00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,000\nexternal devices that you attach to\nthe computer, to make it your own.\n\n24\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,950\nTo make it do the things that you need.\n\n25\n00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,550\nAnd those external devices,\nthose are called peripherals.\n\n26\n00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,740\nA peripheral device is an external\ndevice that you attach to your computer\n\n27\n00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,740\nthat extends its functionality, so for\nexample, maybe your a big video gamer and\n\n28\n00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,760\nyou got a keyboard and a mouse on\nyour computer, maybe that's fine, but\n\n29\n00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,240\nmaybe you want a joystick.\n\n30\n00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,950\nMost computers don't come with a joystick,\nso,\n\n31\n00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,020\nyou've got this perfectly good computer,\nbut you need to buy a new joystick, so\n\n32\n00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,800\nthat you can use the computer the way that\nyou want to, and that's just one example.\n\n33\n00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,982\nThere's many other devices, and we're\ngonna see them all right here in the show.\n\n34\n00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:04,440\n>> Yeah, when it comes down\nto different peripherals,\n\n35\n00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,230\nthe way that we extend\nthe functionality of our computers is\n\n36\n00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,910\nnormally going to be whether we are going\nto purchase what we call an output device.\n\n37\n00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,730\nSo, something like a printer,\nif you're a novelist by chance, and\n\n38\n00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,410\nyou need to printout\nthat first rough draft.\n\n39\n00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,920\nWell, you don't want to actually go,\nI can read it on my screen,\n\n40\n00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,000\nif you want the paper in hand, you're\ngonna need something like a printer, but\n\n41\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,700\nwe also have input devices.\n\n42\n00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,570\nWe may not be satisfied with the standard\nkeyboard that we have built right into our\n\n43\n00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,930\ncomputer, we may want to go out and find\none of those fancy ergonomic keyboards, or\n\n44\n00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,480\nit could be other things,\nlike a big audio file, and\n\n45\n00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,890\nwe need better than the built in speakers.\n\n46\n00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,260\nWe might then add those things in too.\n\n47\n00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,250\nSo usually that's what\nwe're normally shopping for\n\n48\n00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,180\nwhen we talk about periphails.\n\n49\n00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,830\n>> All right so\nRonnie let's start with output devices.\n\n50\n00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,720\nNow output like you said is something\nthat facilitates us getting information\n\n51\n00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,470\nout of the computer.\n\n52\n00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,590\nSo the computer has to tell us things,\nthere's different ways it can do it.\n\n53\n00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,090\nWhen you buy a computer\nthe number one output device for\n\n54\n00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,390\nyou is gonna be the monitor, right?\n\n55\n00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,360\nThe display.\n\n56\n00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,280\nYou're seeing things\nthat are on the screen.\n\n57\n00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,530\nBut your computer likely\ncame with one of those.\n\n58\n00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,910\nSo let's focus on what\nthat it didn't come with.\n\n59\n00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,180\nAnother output device, probably the,\nthe second most popular is a printer.\n\n60\n00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,620\nNow, printers, we've got data in\nthe computer, it's perfectly fine there,\n\n61\n00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,970\nwe can just leave it there.\n\n62\n00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,300\nBut if we wanna take it with us,\n\n63\n00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,830\nif we need to show it to somebody else,\nwe might need to put it on paper.\n\n64\n00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,700\nAnd you can see, even Ronnie and\nI we're, we're techies,\n\n65\n00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,800\nwe do a lot of stuff electronically,\nbut when we start a show.\n\n66\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960\nWe got our show notes right here.\n\n67\n00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,390\nThis is how we know what to talk about.\n\n68\n00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,210\nAnd it's nice to have that\npiece of paper sitting right in\n\n69\n00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,260\nfront of you to reference so you can\nmake sure you didn't miss anything.\n\n70\n00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,640\nSo, people still use printers regularly,\nand\n\n71\n00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,340\nit is a rare computer that\nactually comes with one.\n\n72\n00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,330\nSo, it's something you're\ngoing to need to shop for.\n\n73\n00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,910\nNow, when you go out to buy a printer,\nthere's a lot of choices.\n\n74\n00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,390\nAnd here's where we start to go shopping.\n\n75\n00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,360\nWe're gonna use a,\na website called Newegg in this episode.\n\n76\n00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,900\nAnd you can buy computer components all\nover Newegg is an online retailer and\n\n77\n00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,630\nthey specialize in computer components.\n\n78\n00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,530\nThey have, they have all sorts of stuff so\nthat's kind of why I like them.\n\n79\n00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,960\nTheir website is really\nsuper cluttered though,\n\n80\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,490\nit's a little bit difficult to get around.\n\n81\n00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,070\nIt, it used to be much better.\n\n82\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,020\nBut but they do have a ton of stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,960\nAs you can see all\nthe different divisions here.\n\n84\n00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,080\nAnd if I go under computer hardware,\n\n85\n00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,830\nI'll see all the different things that I\ncould need when it comes to computers.\n\n86\n00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,650\nAnd here under peripherals,\nI can come down and\n\n87\n00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,930\nI can find printers,\nscanners and supplies.\n\n88\n00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,490\nI, I want printers,\nthat's where I'm gonna go.\n\n89\n00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,890\nAll right now when we're shopping for\nprinters,\n\n90\n00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,530\nthere's three main categories of\nprinters that CompTIA calls out, right?\n\n91\n00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,190\nThere's laser, inkjet, and thermal.\n\n92\n00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,980\nLet's talk about each one just briefly.\n\n93\n00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,330\nInkjet is probably the lowest\ncost of the three options.\n\n94\n00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,130\nThe way inkjet works is you have\na little cartridge that's full of ink.\n\n95\n00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,430\nit can just be black ink if it's a black\nand white printer or it can more than one\n\n96\n00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,820\ncartridge with usually it's red,\nyellow or cyan, magenta, and blue right.\n\n97\n00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,120\nI think those are the three colors or\nsomething like that but no cyan,\n\n98\n00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320\nmagenta and yellow, that's it so you have\nthese three different colors that it can\n\n99\n00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,010\nblend to make any other\ncolor that is out there,\n\n100\n00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,330\nthe negative of those is that it is\na liquid that it's shooting out so\n\n101\n00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,780\nwhen you print, the paper can feel\na little bit wet until it dries.\n\n102\n00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,340\nThe other thing is,\nthose ink cartridges are fairly expensive.\n\n103\n00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,310\nVendors that make inkjet printers,\n\n104\n00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,080\nthey don't make money off\nthe physical printer, itself.\n\n105\n00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,850\nThey make money off of\nthe cartridge refills.\n\n106\n00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,470\nAnd so,\nthose refills can be a little pricey.\n\n107\n00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,370\nSo, inkjet printers themselves\nare usually pretty cheap, though, and so\n\n108\n00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,170\nthese are what you'd find in most homes,\nand small offices.\n\n109\n00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,640\nSo, when I go here on Newegg's site and I\ngo shopping, I'm looking for printers, and\n\n110\n00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,040\nI'll see over here in my categories,\nright there, Inkjet Printers.\n\n111\n00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,640\nAnd I can pull that up and I can start\nto see printers that are powered just,\n\n112\n00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,250\njust like I described a moment ago\nwith these little cartridges and\n\n113\n00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,430\nyou'll see $80 for this Brother one and\nthis one does a lot more.\n\n114\n00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,140\nIt's a multi function so it has a scanner\nand copier and all that built into it.\n\n115\n00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,840\nBut, if we just find you know,\nsingle-function printers, which,\n\n116\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,610\ndo they have a little filter?\n\n117\n00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,290\nNo, not really.\n\n118\n00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,140\nI mean, you could just go monochrome,\nju, just black-and-white.\n\n119\n00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,370\nBut but you can go through and, kind of,\npick the different ones, what they do,\n\n120\n00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,900\nhow they work, and you'll see price\npoints that are all over the place.\n\n121\n00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,635\nThey're $70.\n\n122\n00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:21,670\nThis one's $230, but you'll see it's\ngot these extra paper trays but\n\n123\n00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,160\nall of these are ink-jet printers.\n\n124\n00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,790\nThe thing to remember with these is that\nthey're low cost in the beginning, but\n\n125\n00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,200\nthey're high cost to maintain cause\nthe cartridges are expensive and\n\n126\n00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,020\nyou'll burn through\nthe cartridges pretty quickly.\n\n127\n00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,170\nSome of them the really cheap\nones can actually be cheaper.\n\n128\n00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,170\nTo buy an all new printer than it\nis to buy cartridges sometimes.\n\n129\n00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,830\nYou have to be careful\nwhen you pick these,\n\n130\n00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,700\nto make sure that you\nmake the right decision.\n\n131\n00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,380\nWell, let's take this\nBrother here as an example.\n\n132\n00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,510\nIf I take that one, it's $80,\nthat sounds like a pretty good deal, and\n\n133\n00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,235\nNewegg will normally we have\na linked to the cartridges here too.\n\n134\n00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:54,185\nLet me see if I can find that.\n\n135\n00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:55,065\nHere we go.\n\n136\n00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:57,575\nSo if I look at the three item combo here.\n\n137\n00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:01,365\nThis is the three color cartridges,\nits 96.96,\n\n138\n00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:05,095\na $100 to get the full pack of colors.\n\n139\n00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:09,015\nSo if I run my cartridges down, I have\nto replace all of them, it's a $100.\n\n140\n00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:11,415\nThe individual colors\nare a little bit cheaper.\n\n141\n00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:14,380\nYou'll see like green by itself is ten and\nso on.\n\n142\n00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,980\nSo, that price $100 that's\nmore than the printer itself.\n\n143\n00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,590\nAnd that's something we have\nto remember with these,\n\n144\n00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,110\nthey seem like a great deal at first,\nbut in the long run they often aren't.\n\n145\n00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,200\n>> Yeah, most of these newer inkjets\nalso have different ways to connect.\n\n146\n00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,610\nSo, it used to be where you'd\njust have a USB cable, or\n\n147\n00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,370\na printer that would then\nconnect into computer, today,\n\n148\n00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,190\nsome of these printers may have\nmore functionality than that.\n\n149\n00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,970\nSo things like connecting Wi-Fi, so\nthis may be a desirable charact,\n\n150\n00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,910\nor you know, function for your printer.\n\n151\n00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,833\nSo you don't have to run\nan extra wire to it.\n\n152\n00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,841\nBut again, you have to be able\nto take a look at that, and\n\n153\n00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:53,250\nsee what's going to end up being\nthe best fit for what you need.\n\n154\n00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,167\n>> The next type of printer\nis a laser printer.\n\n155\n00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,020\nNow, laser printers are more expensive,\nand so these are the ones that you're\n\n156\n00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,929\ngonna see in businesses and, and, and,\nyou used to see them excl, exclu,\n\n157\n00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,892\nexclusively in businesses cuz\nthey were really expensive.\n\n158\n00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,066\nBut the price has come\ndown on a lot of them.\n\n159\n00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,970\nSo you can find affordable\nlaser printers for home.\n\n160\n00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,330\nNow, I'm go into the laser printers here.\n\n161\n00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,640\nThese work differently.\n\n162\n00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,190\nInstead of having a cartridge full\nof ink that they shoot at the page.\n\n163\n00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,500\nThese actually have a cartridge\nfull of a black resin powder.\n\n164\n00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,120\nAnd it throws this powder on the page,\nand then it shoots it with a laser beam,\n\n165\n00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,580\nwhich basically super heats it and\nmelts it to the page.\n\n166\n00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,885\nThis means that when you print with\na laser printer, when you take that paper\n\n167\n00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:39,390\noff the printer, that paper's usually\na little warm, and it's instantly dry.\n\n168\n00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,680\nThere's no waiting for it to dry.\n\n169\n00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,670\nIt's already there.\n\n170\n00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,070\nYou'll have good, crisp edges.\n\n171\n00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,060\nWith the ink, the ink always seeps\ninto the paper a little bit, and\n\n172\n00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,560\nyou get slightly blurry edges.\n\n173\n00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,310\nIt's fine for most people.\n\n174\n00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,900\nBut, if you're really looking\nto do high quality printing,\n\n175\n00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,840\nlaser printers are the way to go.\n\n176\n00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,580\nNow the negative on a laser\nprinter is the cost.\n\n177\n00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,900\nThe printers are typically expensive and\nthe cartridges are expensive.\n\n178\n00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,720\nSo these guys are just expensive all\naround versus the inkjets that are just\n\n179\n00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,400\nexpensive on the backend, right?\n\n180\n00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,020\nThese guys are expensive all around, but\ntheir quality is significantly higher.\n\n181\n00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,550\nIt is far more common to find black and\nwhite laser printers.\n\n182\n00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,410\nSee how this one says monochrome?\n\n183\n00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,130\nWhere they just have black resin in them.\n\n184\n00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,910\nAnd if that's the case,\nthey may be inexpensive.\n\n185\n00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,000\nThis one's only $100.\n\n186\n00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,390\nBut you can get color ones.\n\n187\n00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,403\nBut if they're color,\nlet's see that one's mono.\n\n188\n00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,390\nI got a bunch of monochrome ones.\n\n189\n00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,640\nIf you find one that's color, it has to\nhave more than one cartridge in it, and\n\n190\n00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,050\nthe price goes up really fast.\n\n191\n00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,830\n>> For the Xerox, yep.\n\n192\n00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,046\n>> Yeah, the, the, the, Xerox one is\nthe lowest color one, I guess, at $250.\n\n193\n00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,920\nBut notice some of these\nother monochrome ones, $530.\n\n194\n00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,370\nThe pricing can be all over the place, but\nremember that cartridge cost on these too.\n\n195\n00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,360\nIf I take this $100 special up here,\nit's $100 for that printer.\n\n196\n00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,508\nIt looks like a good printer.\n\n197\n00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,210\nIt's from HP, you know,\na reputable company.\n\n198\n00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,990\nThey make lots of printers.\n\n199\n00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,300\nAnd, if I come in here and find a refill.\n\n200\n00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,600\nHere we've got a refill that's a two pack.\n\n201\n00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,128\nSo I guess we'll have to\nsee the price in our cart.\n\n202\n00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:05,690\nOh.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,220\n>> Oh well,\n\n204\n00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,783\nthat's the printer and-\n>> Oh.\n\n205\n00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:11,040\n>> One cartridge, oh it is, yeah,\nthe printer and one cartridge.\n\n206\n00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,650\nSo, their charging you fifty bucks.\n\n207\n00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,820\nI guess that's like a discount though.\n\n208\n00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,420\nLet's see what it would cost without\nthat if we just go for this one.\n\n209\n00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,000\nPricing, no, shoot,\nI don't want pictures of it.\n\n210\n00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,390\nThat's not going to help me.\n\n211\n00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,845\n[LAUGH].\nI've got to add to cart to see the price,\n\n212\n00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,115\nthat's bizarre.\n\n213\n00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:27,400\nSo what is it not gonna?\n\n214\n00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,897\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wow.\n\n215\n00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:32,150\n>> Allright, we,\nwe will see this price if it kills us.\n\n216\n00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,035\n>> $113.\n>> There it was, yeah, $113.\n\n217\n00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:39,725\nSo, the printer was was $99 on sale,\nbut it's $113 for the cartridge.\n\n218\n00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,965\nSo the thing to remember though,\n\n219\n00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:47,670\nis that these cartridges here in\na laser printer will last a lot longer.\n\n220\n00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,520\nWith a laser printer it's a powder\nthat's sitting in that cartridge.\n\n221\n00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,230\nAnd the powder can sit there forever,\nand it'll be just fine.\n\n222\n00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,450\nBut in an ink jet printer,\nit's ink, it's a liquid.\n\n223\n00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,602\nAnd whether you use the printer or not,\nthat ink will sit there and congeal.\n\n224\n00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:05,000\nAnd so once you've started using it,\nit's like a timer starts.\n\n225\n00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,440\nAnd usually you're lucky if you\ncan go six months before that,\n\n226\n00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,830\nthat ink is just dried in there.\n\n227\n00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,160\nI had bought a laser printer for\nme at home to use, and\n\n228\n00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,670\nI didn't use it very frequently.\n\n229\n00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,120\nAnd I had a cartridge, and\nthey call them toner cartridges.\n\n230\n00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,940\nSo I had a toner cartridge\nthat sat in that printer for\n\n231\n00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,490\nover three years before I finally ran it\nout of toner, and had to buy a new one.\n\n232\n00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,450\nSo, while the toner is more expensive, it\ntypically lasts a lot longer than the ink.\n\n233\n00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,020\nBecause it doesn't congeal,\nand it can just sit there, and\n\n234\n00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,200\nit'll last forever, right?\n\n235\n00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,767\nSo keep that in mind when you\ndo the choice, the, the picking.\n\n236\n00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:43,300\nSo, if you're gonna be printing in\nlarge volume, lots of paper, and you're\n\n237\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,060\nworried about quality, you want the best\nquality, laser printers are the way to go.\n\n238\n00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,520\nIf you're on a budget, you want a cheaper\nprinter, and you're not gonna be\n\n239\n00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,415\nprinting in high volume, then an inkjet\nprinter can be much more affordable.\n\n240\n00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,890\nWith lower quality, if they break,\n\n241\n00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,985\nit is never worth it to\nrepair an inkjet printer.\n\n242\n00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You just throw it away and\n\n243\n00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,360\nyou buy a new one.\n\n244\n00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,890\nLaser printers,\n\n245\n00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,590\nyou can find people all over the place\nthat do laser printer repair.\n\n246\n00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,950\nInkjets, it's just not worth it.\n\n247\n00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,259\nYou just go and buy a new one.\n\n248\n00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,870\nAll right, so those are the two\nmost common types of printers.\n\n249\n00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,450\nNow, CompTIA calls out one more.\n\n250\n00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,640\nThe third one they call it,\nis a thermal printer.\n\n251\n00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,950\n>> Yeah, the thermal printer actually\nuses a couple different methods.\n\n252\n00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,225\nBut it's really about\nhaving a heated mechanism,\n\n253\n00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:28,280\nagainst a very special paper\nthat will react to the heat.\n\n254\n00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,269\nSo you normally see this and\n\n255\n00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,430\nyou've probably have used it even if\nyou don't realize you've done it.\n\n256\n00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,100\nIf you've gone and\ngotten a receipt from the gas pump and\n\n257\n00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,116\nit printed out almost immediately,\nthat's probably a thermal printer.\n\n258\n00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:40,060\nIf you've gone to Walmart,\nlike my wife has,\n\n259\n00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,218\nand bought enough groceries\nto print a six-foot receipt.\n\n260\n00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it prints out in under a second,\n\n261\n00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,320\nthat's a thermal printer.\n\n262\n00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,310\nVery fast, very direct, but\nit does use specialized paper.\n\n263\n00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,200\n>> Yeah, with thermal printers,\nthey're very expensive, and\n\n264\n00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,190\nso you're not gonna have a thermal print,\nprinter at home.\n\n265\n00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,110\nThe nice thing about a thermal printer\nis since they're just using heat,\n\n266\n00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,535\nthey never run out of ink,\nor toner, or whatever.\n\n267\n00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:01,840\nThere's nothing to refill.\n\n268\n00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320\nThe only thing to refill on\na thermal printer is the paper,\n\n269\n00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,500\nand that makes them perfect for\ncash registers, and gas stations and, and\n\n270\n00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,280\nthat's where they're frequently used.\n\n271\n00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,560\nThere is a negative to thermal paper,\nthough.\n\n272\n00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,970\nWhich is, over time the,\nthe, it's not ink, right?\n\n273\n00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,140\nThe, the writing, the, the imprint\nthat's made on that paper will fade and\n\n274\n00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,240\ndisappear.\n\n275\n00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,720\nSo thermal printers do not give you\nlong time storage of a document.\n\n276\n00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,070\nVersus laser, once that's been written on\nto that paper, it will stay there forever.\n\n277\n00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,062\nThat, that resin never turns\nback to powder again, you know?\n\n278\n00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,050\nIt'll stay on there forever.\n\n279\n00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,595\nBut, after about eight to nine years,\nthermal paper will go blank.\n\n280\n00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n281\n00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,570\n>> Or, we're in Florida, right?\n\n282\n00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,092\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And in Florida, it gets so\n\n283\n00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,701\nhot in our vehicles in the summer,\n\n284\n00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,157\nthat if you leave a receipt\nin your car in the summer.\n\n285\n00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:48,841\n>> It turns brown.\n\n286\n00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,546\n>> The whole thing turns black as\nif it was all written to, and, and\n\n287\n00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,760\nyou can't read it anymore.\n\n288\n00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,918\nSo, thermal is not for long time storage,\nbut for, for really utility use.\n\n289\n00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:58,762\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n290\n00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:01,240\nI don't even know if sell\nany thermal printers.\n\n291\n00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,862\nLet's see if I can find a thermal\nprinter here on Newegg.\n\n292\n00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:10,100\nOh there's a, an Epson thermal\nreceipt printer, right there.\n\n293\n00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,770\nAnd it's $130,\nactually not that bad for price.\n\n294\n00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,670\nAnd there's no, there's no ink, or toner,\nor whatever, but you just have to buy\n\n295\n00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,600\nthe right paper for it, and somewhere in\nhere it'll tell you what paper to use.\n\n296\n00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,305\nIt doesn't use normal paper, because it's\ngot to have paper that's heat reactive.\n\n297\n00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:27,350\nIt reacts to heat and turns black.\n\n298\n00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,052\n>> Without catching on fire.\n\n299\n00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:28,552\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n300\n00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,330\n>> That's, that's the other part, right?\n\n301\n00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,919\n>> Yeah, over on my computer, I, I, I,\n\n302\n00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,555\nI've pulled up a different site,\n>> Okay.\n\n303\n00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:36,664\n>> And what, what, what Don is talking\nabout expensive, we weren't joking.\n\n304\n00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,590\nNow, this first one you go, okay $341.\n\n305\n00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,249\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> But notice the kind of more industrial\n\n306\n00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:46,366\nones here, when you start seeing $3,800,\n$2,000, $2,400.\n\n307\n00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,770\nSo, they, they tend to range in,\nin the more expensive end.\n\n308\n00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,600\nI think you can get those that are,\nthat are smaller, but these are probably\n\n309\n00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,810\nthe ones that are designed to run for\nyears, and years on end, problem free.\n\n310\n00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,600\nJust putting the paper in.\n\n311\n00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,790\n>> Those two at the bottom\nare the kind they use at like UPS, or\n\n312\n00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,740\nthe airport,\nbecause they print on stickers.\n\n313\n00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,760\nAnd that's really tricky.\n\n314\n00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,130\nHow do you heat the paper\nto write on it without\n\n315\n00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,100\nruining the adhesive on the back side?\n\n316\n00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,050\nAnd those get to be pretty expensive,\ntoo, so you'll see the pricing there.\n\n317\n00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,343\nBut these will run for\nyears without maintenance.\n\n318\n00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:19,040\nVersus an inkjet or a laser jet that,\nthat would need maintenance in that time.\n\n319\n00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,120\nSo, finding the right printer for\nthe situation is important.\n\n320\n00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,410\nA lot of times it comes down to cost.\n\n321\n00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,680\nBut, but this is one of the most common\noutput devices that we purchase.\n\n322\n00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,270\nAlright, the next output device we're\ngonna talk about are displays, monitors.\n\n323\n00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,360\nYour computer or\nyour laptop more than likely has one.\n\n324\n00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,730\nWhen you buy, it,\nit usually comes with one.\n\n325\n00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,750\nBut you might not want to stick with that.\n\n326\n00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,240\nMaybe there's some improvement\nthat you want to make.\n\n327\n00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,458\n>> Usually people want to\nget a bigger monitor, or\n\n328\n00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,958\nmaybe you want to have more than one\nmonitor, a lot of us do that, you know?\n\n329\n00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,601\nIf you're working on a lot\nof things simultaneously,\n\n330\n00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,042\none screen may not be enough.\n\n331\n00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,043\nSo you may choose to go to two screens or\nmore.\n\n332\n00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:57,792\nSo That's when we go into\nthe market to go and buy monitors.\n\n333\n00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,833\n>> Yeah.\n\n334\n00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,807\nPicking a monitor is probably one of the,\nthe critical things that you will do for\n\n335\n00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,140\nyour computer.\n\n336\n00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,560\nIt's kind of strange when you go okay,\nI found this monitor,\n\n337\n00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,300\nthe price looks right, and you get it\nhome and you're disappointed with it.\n\n338\n00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,130\nAnd that's one of those things\nin which you don't want to be,\n\n339\n00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,870\nso picking the right monitor is,\nis pretty crucial.\n\n340\n00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,270\nMost of us if we're gonna be\nsetting up a desktop computer,\n\n341\n00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,040\nwe're gonna want a larger monitor.\n\n342\n00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,510\nBut it does depend on where you have\nenough space to be able to put it.\n\n343\n00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,200\nBut overall though, that's usually\nthe reason why I would go and\n\n344\n00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,180\nget another monitor, Dave,\ncuz I want it bigger.\n\n345\n00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,570\n>> Now, calls out three types of displays,\nso let's run down each one.\n\n346\n00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,980\nThe first one is, is kind of the defacto\nstandard, which is a flat screen monitor.\n\n347\n00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,520\nWith a flat screen we're\nnormally talking about\n\n348\n00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,720\nLCD's which are liquid crystal displays so\nthat type of a flat screen.\n\n349\n00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,240\nBut there's also plasmas and OLEDs and\nall sorts of other varieties of it.\n\n350\n00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,360\nBut these are, are screens like, like what\nI have in my laptop where it's a very,\n\n351\n00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,930\nvery thin screen, so\nit doesn't take up a lot of desk space.\n\n352\n00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,230\nAnd this is what most people use today.\n\n353\n00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,150\nSo if you're buying a new monitor, you'll\nnormally be searching for a flat screen.\n\n354\n00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,930\nAnd in fact, here on the Newegg\nsite when I clicked on Displays,\n\n355\n00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,250\nI didn't filter this for flat screens but\nthat's, that's what I'm seeing,\n\n356\n00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,475\nis just flat screen after flat screen\nafter flat flatscreen, because that's what\n\n357\n00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:19,065\nmost people are buying these days,\nyou know, if you're out there shopping.\n\n358\n00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,525\nSo it used to be these\nwere incredibly expensive,\n\n359\n00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,895\nnow they're pretty much\nrun-of-the-mill price.\n\n360\n00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:25,985\nSo, like here's an ASUS\none that is 23 inches.\n\n361\n00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:28,705\nThis is pretty big, and it's $160.\n\n362\n00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:30,665\nThat's a reasonable price.\n\n363\n00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:34,035\nWhen you buy a flatscreen, there's\na few things you need to keep in mind.\n\n364\n00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:37,250\nOne of the main things is\nthis number right here.\n\n365\n00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,380\nThis is called a contrast ratio.\n\n366\n00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,170\nAnd here, this one is 50 million to 1.\n\n367\n00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,100\n>> What a ratio.\n\n368\n00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,380\n>> What does that mean?\n\n369\n00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,460\nWell, one of the limitations of a flat\nscreen is it's really difficult for\n\n370\n00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,380\nthem to render black.\n\n371\n00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,250\nThere's, there's no way for\nthem to generate a black light.\n\n372\n00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,760\nAnd I'm not talking about, like, the black\nlight from a stoner frat house, right,\n\n373\n00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,604\nwhere it's a purple light.\n\n374\n00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:01,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm talking about actual black.\n\n375\n00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,480\nAnd so, what a lot of these monitors do,\nis they have to find some way to\n\n376\n00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,440\ntrick it by like, not lighting up\na particular area of the screen.\n\n377\n00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,690\nBut color will bleed in from\nthe other cells that are around it.\n\n378\n00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,260\nAnd that results in something that's\nnot truly black, you'll get grays, or\n\n379\n00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,840\nreally dark gray.\n\n380\n00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,180\nAnd so, this contrast ratio,\n\n381\n00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,130\nthe bigger that number is,\nthe more black the black will look.\n\n382\n00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,750\nAnd what that results in is\nmore definition, more contrast,\n\n383\n00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,060\nthe picture will look sharper.\n\n384\n00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,660\nYou'll have a better picture.\n\n385\n00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,490\nSo that's one of the big\nthings that they advertise.\n\n386\n00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,410\nA lot of us need to pay attention to that.\n\n387\n00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,840\nThe size is important.\n\n388\n00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,810\nThis one's 23 inches and\nthat's measured diagonally.\n\n389\n00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,460\nIt's kind of a tricky thing they do.\n\n390\n00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,860\nSo it's measurement diagonally from this\ncorner down here to this corner up here.\n\n391\n00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,493\nAnd the reason they do that is different\nmonitors have different what they call\n\n392\n00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,480\naspect ratios.\n\n393\n00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,870\nSome of them are more\nwide than they are tall.\n\n394\n00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,800\nOther ones are more tall\nthan they are wide.\n\n395\n00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,530\nAnd so this diagonal measure\nensures a fair measurement\n\n396\n00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,040\nregardless of what that aspect ratio is.\n\n397\n00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,930\nThey've been doing that in TVs since\nthe 40's, so that's not a new thing.\n\n398\n00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,110\nBut but this one is 23 inches.\n\n399\n00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,880\nThe only other thing that we\nreally worry about on these,\n\n400\n00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,830\nis what's called a refresh rate.\n\n401\n00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,700\nA lot of these will run at 60 hertz,\n\n402\n00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,920\nand that means that they're refreshing\nthe screen over 60 times per second.\n\n403\n00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,130\nThe human eye can't perceive that,\n\n404\n00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,420\nthe human eye can perceive\nabout it's just like under 30.\n\n405\n00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,510\nI think it's more like 24 frames\nper second is what they can see.\n\n406\n00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,920\nSo any thing above that is fine.\n\n407\n00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,200\nMost of them are at 60 hertz.\n\n408\n00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,880\nWhen you buy a television\nit's a different story.\n\n409\n00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,646\nBut, when you buy\na computer monitor they're,\n\n410\n00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,260\nthey're almost all above that limit.\n\n411\n00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,560\nSo not something you have\nto worry about too much.\n\n412\n00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,399\nSo those are flat screens and\nthat's what we normally want these days.\n\n413\n00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,000\nNow, what did we have before flat screens?\n\n414\n00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,130\n>> We had what we called CRT monitors\non our computers, which stands for\n\n415\n00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,880\ncathode ray tube.\n\n416\n00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,700\nThese are the ones that look\nmore traditional, like a TV set,\n\n417\n00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,760\nthat have not only a,\na glass screen on the front, but\n\n418\n00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,370\nyou also see that the back of it extends\nout and takes up a lot of space.\n\n419\n00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,380\nAnd incredibly heavy,\nin comparison to a flat screen, a monitor.\n\n420\n00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,760\n>> And as I expected,\nthey do not sell any CRTs.\n\n421\n00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,570\nYou will have a really hard\ntime finding CRTs today.\n\n422\n00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,520\nLemme just,\nI'll do like a google image search.\n\n423\n00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,860\nI doubt we'll find anybody\nstill selling a CRT monitor.\n\n424\n00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,980\nThere are some interesting\nthings about CRTs.\n\n425\n00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:29,700\nSo, if you grew up between the 1940s and\nthe 1990s really.\n\n426\n00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,160\nYou watched television on a CRT,\na cathode ray tube.\n\n427\n00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,880\nThe monitors were big, so you had your\nglass screen, which had a little bit of\n\n428\n00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,090\ncurvature to it because it was a tube, and\na huge bump that came out of the back that\n\n429\n00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,815\nmeant that the the TV was usually\ndeeper than it was tall or wide.\n\n430\n00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:49,720\nYou know, these things were big and heavy.\n\n431\n00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,560\nAnd they worked by shooting little\nlight rays from a magnet in the back\n\n432\n00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,330\nat the screen.\n\n433\n00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,620\nThey'd shoot red and green and blue, and\n\n434\n00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,190\nthrow these colors at the screen to light\nit up and create the images that we saw.\n\n435\n00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,900\nOn a positive side, they did\na really good job of showing black.\n\n436\n00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,570\nWe didn't have the problems with\ncontrast ratios on, on CRTs.\n\n437\n00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,790\nOn a negative side they're not energy\nefficient, they're really heavy.\n\n438\n00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,920\nThe bigger they get, the heavier they get.\n\n439\n00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,550\nAnd their biggest problem?\n\n440\n00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,500\nThey're lined with lead.\n\n441\n00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,240\nThere's lead in the CRT,\nwhich is a toxic chemical, so\n\n442\n00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880\nthey can't be disposed of safely.\n\n443\n00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,695\nAnd so landfills are now\nfull of this toxic metal,\n\n444\n00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:30,830\nthanks to the CRTs we've\nused over the years.\n\n445\n00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,580\nThey're also not very energy efficient.\n\n446\n00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,860\nThey draw a lot of electricity.\n\n447\n00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,970\nThey have a giant capacitor on the back\nend that's storing electricity.\n\n448\n00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,940\nAnd if you take one of these apart and\nstick a screwdriver in there,\n\n449\n00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,250\nit actually, while the TV is on,\nit's enough voltage to kill you.\n\n450\n00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,160\nSo it is an extremely\ndangerous thing to work on.\n\n451\n00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,560\nWhile the TV is off you can dissipate that\ncharge and then you can work with it,\n\n452\n00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,050\nbut if you do it all\nthe time it will kill you.\n\n453\n00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,828\nThis is dangerous stuff.\n\n454\n00:21:56,828 --> 00:22:01,510\nSo a lot of bad things about CRTs,\nand that's why as soon as the flat\n\n455\n00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,030\nscreens got down to the right price point,\nCRTs were gone.\n\n456\n00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,690\nMost people won't even sell them.\n\n457\n00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,063\nThey're heavy, they're hard to ship,\nthey, they're just aren't a great, and\n\n458\n00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:10,880\nthey're fragile.\n\n459\n00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,360\n>> So moving them around to much, and\nif you had a lot of CRTs in one room they\n\n460\n00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,957\nwould start interfering\nwith each other too.\n\n461\n00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,100\nThey'd really did so\n\n462\n00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,300\nmuch of that radiation, it was amazing\n>> All right,\n\n463\n00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,790\nso those we need to be familiar with just\nbecause they did exist although I doubt we\n\n464\n00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,720\nare gonna see them ourselves.\n\n465\n00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,830\nThe last one that calls\nout is a projector.\n\n466\n00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,030\nNow, when we're dealing with\nour own computer, we're not,\n\n467\n00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,180\nwe're not really gonna deal\nwith a projector in that case.\n\n468\n00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,334\nBut, if you're trying\nto do a presentation,\n\n469\n00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:44,147\nif you're standing up in front of a room\nfull of people, and you wanna get out and,\n\n470\n00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:47,100\nand do a presentation,\nyou will likely purchase a projector.\n\n471\n00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,830\nAnd, I thought they had a,\nthere it is, a category just for it.\n\n472\n00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,450\nAnd all a projector is, is a monitor that\ninstead of throwing its image at a screen,\n\n473\n00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,160\nit throws its image outside,\nthrows it at a wall.\n\n474\n00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,750\nSo you can point a projector to the wall,\nand it'll throw the image up there.\n\n475\n00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,840\nAnd these used to be incredibly expensive,\ntoo, but they've come down a good bit.\n\n476\n00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,420\nNow, if you choose to go\nthe route of a projector,\n\n477\n00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,290\nthere's a few things to keep in mind.\n\n478\n00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,930\nThey're designed to project against\na blank screen, preferably white.\n\n479\n00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,670\nThe more white the better.\n\n480\n00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,690\nIf there's any coloration to it,\n\n481\n00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,760\nit'll start to, to saturate some\nof the other colors that you get.\n\n482\n00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,010\nIf you're going hardcore, professional\nstyle they actually have this light\n\n483\n00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,980\ngray that's designed to be a perfect,\nnon-reflective surface.\n\n484\n00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,950\nSo you'll see a light gray\npretty frequently too.\n\n485\n00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,110\nThat's what you normally\nsee at movie theaters.\n\n486\n00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,680\nWhen you throw your\nprojection image up there,\n\n487\n00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,980\nthere's a certain level of brightness\nyou need to keep the picture clear.\n\n488\n00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,371\nSo, when you shop for a projector,\n\n489\n00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:48,333\none of the things they'll advertise\nis how many lumens the projector is.\n\n490\n00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,897\nAnd the lumens,\nlike this guy right here is 3,000 lumens,\n\n491\n00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,040\nthink of that as the brightness.\n\n492\n00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,913\nThe more lumens it has,\nthe brighter that picture will be,\n\n493\n00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,043\nwhich means the better image you'll have.\n\n494\n00:23:59,043 --> 00:23:59,833\n>> Right.\n\n495\n00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,376\nIt also means the more\nheat it will give off.\n\n496\n00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:03,792\nProjectors generate heat,\n\n497\n00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:07,573\nso it's not something you want sitting\nright next to you on a hot summer day.\n\n498\n00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:12,428\nThe other thing is they use bulbs,\nlike traditional light bulbs and\n\n499\n00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:15,165\nbecause they do, light bulbs go bad.\n\n500\n00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:18,773\nAnd the bulb is what's really\ndoing the work in the projector.\n\n501\n00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:19,964\nSo when that bulb fails,\n\n502\n00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:23,143\nthat little glass bulb right there\nin the center of the projector,\n\n503\n00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:26,581\nwhen that fails you gotta replace it and\nthey're typically not cheap.\n\n504\n00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,199\nThis bulb this projector right here,\n\n505\n00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:33,586\nthis Acer P1173 It's $250.00,\npretty inexpensive.\n\n506\n00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:37,178\nBut if we go down here and find out what\na replacement bulb would cost for it,\n\n507\n00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,618\nwhich they may not sell.\n\n508\n00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:41,601\nNormally, normally, they tell us\nright in here what the bulb is.\n\n509\n00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:45,853\nLet's see if we can find it as we look\ndown here, so this one 3,000 lumens.\n\n510\n00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,002\nThere's our lens.\n\n511\n00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:47,536\n>> Lamp replacement.\n\n512\n00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:48,788\n>> There we go.\n\n513\n00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,788\nSo, if we wanna replaceable lamp,\n\n514\n00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:57,193\nit is a Osram 190 [LAUGH] watt,\nuser replaceable, PViP lamp.\n\n515\n00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,440\nThat's a funny name.\n\n516\n00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,883\nSo let's search for that and\nsee how much one of those costs.\n\n517\n00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:04,013\nSo that is an ongoing\ncost you're gonna have.\n\n518\n00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:06,643\nIf you have a flat screen,\nthat thing's gonna last forever.\n\n519\n00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:07,328\nRight?\n\n520\n00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,164\nBut if you have a projector, you're gonna\nhave to periodically replace the bulb.\n\n521\n00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:13,017\nThe projector will get dimmer and\ndimmer and dimmer and\n\n522\n00:25:13,017 --> 00:25:15,869\nyou'll have to move it closer and\ncloser to the wall and\n\n523\n00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:19,112\nthe closer to the wall you get,\nthe smaller the picture gets.\n\n524\n00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:22,386\nSo, if you wanna keep that nice big\npicture, you've gotta replace it.\n\n525\n00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:27,679\nSo here's one of those Osram bulbs bulbs,\nwhich is $125.\n\n526\n00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,091\nSo, about half the price of the projector,\nso you've gotta replace that every few,\n\n527\n00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,986\nfew years and that'll,\nthat'll factor in your cost.\n\n528\n00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:39,064\nIt, it does depend on how often\nyou keep the projector on.\n\n529\n00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:41,081\nYou know, we used to have those\nold classroom projectors.\n\n530\n00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:41,685\n>> Right.\n\n531\n00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:44,547\n>> We kept on all the time and what,\nwhat would they get us, maybe,\n\n532\n00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:45,401\nmaybe six months.\n\n533\n00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:46,678\n>> Maybe.\n\n534\n00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,683\nBut you might have a home\ntheater projector,\n\n535\n00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:51,975\nwhere you get a few years out of it,\njust because you don't use it as much.\n\n536\n00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,310\nBut if you use it professionally,\nyou'll, you'll burn through those bulbs.\n\n537\n00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,495\n>> Yeah, if they don't turn darker,\nthey turn yellowish or\n\n538\n00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:00,230\ngreenish in color and\nthen that's when you know.\n\n539\n00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,182\nAnd normally,\nif you leave them on long enough,\n\n540\n00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:05,710\nthey will pop a very, very explosively.\n\n541\n00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,546\nIt's kind of neat.\n\n542\n00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:07,904\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n543\n00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:08,462\nHow do I know?\n\n544\n00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:10,679\nI know, I've done it.\n\n545\n00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,213\n>> All right.\n\n546\n00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,099\nThe, the last peripheral for\n\n547\n00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,728\noutput devices that come to\nyour calls out are speakers.\n\n548\n00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:19,813\nSo printers,\nthat's a visual thing that we can touch.\n\n549\n00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:22,568\nMonitors, that's a visual\nthing that we can see.\n\n550\n00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:26,141\nHere we've got speakers,\nwhich is something we can hear.\n\n551\n00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:29,922\nSo with speakers your computer might\ncome with some, it might not and\n\n552\n00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,016\nyou can get very fancy with these too.\n\n553\n00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,787\nSo let's go into our computer hardware and\n\n554\n00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:38,321\nsee if we can't find speakers\nburied away in here.\n\n555\n00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:42,088\nOh, that'd be under category.\n\n556\n00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:44,167\n>> Headset and\nspeakers underneath keyboard and mice.\n\n557\n00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,515\n>> All right.\nThere we go.\n\n558\n00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,158\nYou know,\nI'm kind of glad it mentions headsets,\n\n559\n00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:48,469\nbecause a lot of people-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n560\n00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:52,669\n>> Don't think about that if you're\nthe only person using the computer you can\n\n561\n00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:56,765\nsave a lot of money by getting high\nquality headsets and they'll sound great.\n\n562\n00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,088\nBut if you want other people\nto be able to hear or\n\n563\n00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:02,797\nif you just don't want to wear a headset,\nthen speakers are the way to go.\n\n564\n00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:07,792\nAnd when you purchase speakers,\nmost speakers are, I'm gonna say, it,\n\n565\n00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,550\nmost of them are the same.\n\n566\n00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,874\nRight?\nNow the vendors will all tell you\n\n567\n00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:13,527\nthere's various things that make them\nbetter, especially Bose, these guys.\n\n568\n00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,053\nRight?\nThey're like we make the best\n\n569\n00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:15,645\nspeakers ever.\n\n570\n00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:19,587\nAnd so they'll have a simple set of\nspeakers that from any other vendor would\n\n571\n00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,758\ncost $20, but from them is $100.\n\n572\n00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:25,723\nThere is some science behind that,\nthey do have different upper and\n\n573\n00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:29,038\nlower tone levels and\nbetter bass representation and so on.\n\n574\n00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,116\nSo, if you are a audiophile,\nif that's something important,\n\n575\n00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,976\nyou'll need to shop around to\nfind ones with good reviews.\n\n576\n00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:38,113\nBut oftentimes,\nyou can find a set of speakers and\n\n577\n00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:41,111\na subwoofer to handle the bass for\nvery little.\n\n578\n00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:46,166\nHere's $40 for that whole set versus\nsomething like up here $100 with no,\n\n579\n00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,419\nno subwoofer.\n\n580\n00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,623\nSo you have to shop around,\nfind the one you want.\n\n581\n00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:54,451\nBut almost all of them use 3.5\nmillimeter headphone jack that's\n\n582\n00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:58,186\npretty much you pick with is headsets and\nspeakers.\n\n583\n00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:01,684\nSo, it's not like there's some kind\nof special version or whatever,\n\n584\n00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:03,799\nyou just buy the ones\nthat meet your needs.\n\n585\n00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,027\nThere are ones that have surround sound,\nso\n\n586\n00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,989\nthey'll have multiple speakers\nlike this Logitech set.\n\n587\n00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:14,004\nAnd for those, a lot of times you have to\nhave a, the sound card that handles that,\n\n588\n00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:18,454\nyour traditional headphone jack only\ndoes left and right stereo audio.\n\n589\n00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:21,954\nBut this one has a left front,\na left rear, a right front and\n\n590\n00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:24,343\nright rear, a center channel and a sub.\n\n591\n00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,524\nThis is a 5.1 system.\n\n592\n00:28:26,524 --> 00:28:28,633\nThere's five speakers and one subwoofer.\n\n593\n00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:32,650\nSo there's six different signals\nyour soundcard has to send out,\n\n594\n00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,886\nyour sound card has to support that.\n\n595\n00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,581\nMy laptop does not support that.\n\n596\n00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,576\nSo, if I bought this set and hooked it up,\nit would actually turn it into stereo.\n\n597\n00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,471\nIt would just send the two signals,\nI wouldn't get the full benefit.\n\n598\n00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,528\nBut if I had a digital soundcard that\nhad a fiber optic connection on it,\n\n599\n00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:51,113\nI could run that into these and\nthen I would get 5.1 different\n\n600\n00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:54,246\nsound signals from each\nspeaker in those video games.\n\n601\n00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:57,026\nYou'd hear people behind you and\nstuff, you know, that,\n\n602\n00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,096\nthat's really where things get exciting.\n\n603\n00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:01,290\nSo that's really the only\nconsideration we go to buy these.\n\n604\n00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,765\nDo we need all this?\n\n605\n00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:05,115\nDo we need a huge set?\n\n606\n00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:09,044\nOne other thing to keep in mind is you\nmight not need your speakers very often at\n\n607\n00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:11,947\nall and so they make some\nspeakers that are speaker bars,\n\n608\n00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:14,143\nthey attach to the bottom of your monitor.\n\n609\n00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,743\nLet me see,\ndo they have a category for that?\n\n610\n00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:17,873\nI'll just do a search.\n\n611\n00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:20,353\nI don't want to mess\naround with that too much.\n\n612\n00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:24,339\nBut they'll have speaker bars that attach\nto the bottom of the monitor like this, so\n\n613\n00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,465\nthey're out of the way.\n\n614\n00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:27,717\nYou know,\nthey're not taking up space on desk.\n\n615\n00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:31,048\nThey just stick on the bottom or the top\nof the monitor and, and there it goes.\n\n616\n00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:31,818\nThose look a little ancient.\n\n617\n00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:34,163\nHere this one's a little more indicative.\n\n618\n00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,790\nSo you'll see the speaker and\n\n619\n00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,573\nright above that is a little clip\nthat it uses to attach that monitor.\n\n620\n00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,294\nSo those type of things you can find.\n\n621\n00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,430\nAgain, if you're going to\nuse infrequently, you've,\n\n622\n00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,528\nyou've got that available.\n\n623\n00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:47,172\nPersonally, I, I just use headphones.\n\n624\n00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:52,995\nI, I don't use external speakers anymore,\nbut a lot of people do.\n\n625\n00:29:52,995 --> 00:29:53,544\nAll right.\n\n626\n00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,153\nSo that's about it for output devices.\n\n627\n00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:59,080\nWe still have our input devices and\nthen at the end of the show,\n\n628\n00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,026\nwe're gonna tackle devices that do both,\ninput and output.\n\n629\n00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:05,429\nBut for right now, this is a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n630\n00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,393\nSo let's pause here and when we get back,\nwe'll tackle input devices.\n\n631\n00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,216\nWe'll see you soon.\n\n632\n00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:18,629\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n633\n00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:19,918\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n634\n00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,249\nSo, in this segment, we're gonna take\na look at the opposite of what we did in\n\n635\n00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:25,781\nthe first segment where we\nlooked at output devices.\n\n636\n00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,473\nNow we're gonna look at input devices.\n\n637\n00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:32,716\nWays that we can communicate\nwith the computer.\n\n638\n00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:36,566\nThe very first one that comes to\nyour calls out is the most common,\n\n639\n00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:40,276\nthe one that darn near everybody uses and\nthat is the keyboard.\n\n640\n00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:43,761\nKeyboards, the series of buttons that\nrepresents all the letters of the alphabet\n\n641\n00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,793\nand you can type words\nby pressing the buttons.\n\n642\n00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,941\nIf you got to our website, I don't have\nto explain to you what a keyboard is.\n\n643\n00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,202\nThat one's pretty straightforward, right?\n\n644\n00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:53,398\n>> Yeah,\nthere's many different types of keyboards.\n\n645\n00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,889\nSome are actually highly specialized\nusage for people, like gamers or\n\n646\n00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,682\npeople that are doing high-end\nproductivity work, but\n\n647\n00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:02,956\nthen there's other ones that\nare just regular generic keyboard.\n\n648\n00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:06,809\nI don't know of any computer system,\nPC system that you'd buy\n\n649\n00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,416\nfrom anywhere that wouldn't normally come\nwith at least a keyboard and a mouse.\n\n650\n00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,774\nBut sometimes,\nthat's just not enough for people and so\n\n651\n00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:17,067\nthere are highly specialized ones that\nyou may want to get into, especially for\n\n652\n00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,806\nlike, things like home entertainment.\n\n653\n00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:21,561\nYou name it, there's so\nmany one of them out there.\n\n654\n00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:24,829\n>> Yeah, if you're a professional\ntypist or if you just type a lot.\n\n655\n00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:27,259\nThere's custom keyboards\nthat are laid out for you.\n\n656\n00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:30,363\nYour average keyboard is not\nreally laid out for speed.\n\n657\n00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,288\nAnd so, if you do this professionally,\n\n658\n00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,753\nyou can get ergonomic keyboards that\nhave the keyboard divided in half.\n\n659\n00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,018\nLet me show some pictures.\n\n660\n00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:41,233\nSo here's an example right here, right?\n\n661\n00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,874\nLet me zoom in, no, why?\n\n662\n00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:44,337\nAnd why would it, really.\n\n663\n00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:45,092\nAll right.\n\n664\n00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,124\nSo, so here's an example\nof just a regular keyboard.\n\n665\n00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:50,000\nYou know, it's a flat arrangement you've\ngot your little buttons and, and things.\n\n666\n00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,854\nI love that I clicked on that\nit didn't get any bigger.\n\n667\n00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:53,875\nThere it goes.\n\n668\n00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,417\nThat that's your traditional average\nKeyboard, nothing too special there.\n\n669\n00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,334\nAnd those are pretty inexpensive, $18.\n\n670\n00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:05,134\nFor a little bit more, you can step up and\nget something like an ergonomic keyboard,\n\n671\n00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:09,325\nand you'll see that while the letters\nare still in the same order they've\n\n672\n00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:13,719\ndivided the keyboard in half and for\na professional typist that allows them to\n\n673\n00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:16,557\nhave their left hand resting\nhere comfortably and\n\n674\n00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:21,565\ntheir right hand over here comfortable and\nbe able to type very, very rapidly.\n\n675\n00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,735\nNow if you are, are a professional you\ndon't have to look at the keys when you\n\n676\n00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,560\ntype this works out really well.\n\n677\n00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,360\nBut if you're a visual typer where\nyou're looking at the keys to find it,\n\n678\n00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,300\nthese keyboards are super mega annoying,\nand so, you know, you may not want that.\n\n679\n00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,588\nThese keyboards tough aren't\nthat much more expensive and\n\n680\n00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,010\nsome people buy them if they choose.\n\n681\n00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,722\nOne word of caution,\ndepending on what country you're in, and\n\n682\n00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:47,770\nwhat language you speak natively there\nare what are called localized keyboards.\n\n683\n00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,040\nThe keyboards that I'm showing you here,\nthese are for U.S. English, right.\n\n684\n00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,680\nAnd, and for the most part\nthey're the same ones used in,\n\n685\n00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,750\nin England and\nother English speaking countries.\n\n686\n00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,470\nAnd, they're arranged in a way, like,\n\n687\n00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,250\nyou can see here in this picture where\nit's got Q.W.E.R.T.Y. across the top.\n\n688\n00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,070\nWe call them qwerty keyboards.\n\n689\n00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,990\nOther countries and\nother languages use different formats.\n\n690\n00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,470\nSo for example if you go to France and you\nbuy a keyboard, they use azerty keyboards.\n\n691\n00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,230\nThat top row that's qwerty on their's it's\nazerty and it's a different arrangement.\n\n692\n00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,700\nSo different countries use different\nletter arrangements on their keyboards.\n\n693\n00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,540\nThey're not all the same.\n\n694\n00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,450\nAlright.\n\n695\n00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,470\nAnd there's also some other special\nkeys you may or may not have,\n\n696\n00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,370\nlike turning up the volume,\nturning down the volume, things like that.\n\n697\n00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,950\nPeople can add those to a keyboard but\ntypically it's letters, numbers and\n\n698\n00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,360\nfunction keys and, and that's about it.\n\n699\n00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,860\nAlright?\n\n700\n00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,170\nSo not too much on keyboards.\n\n701\n00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,960\nAn area where we have\na lot more choice though?\n\n702\n00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,235\nPointing devices.\n\n703\n00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,415\nThe keyboard is one way we talk to\nthe computer, but our mouse is another.\n\n704\n00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:52,215\nAnd that's what I'm using\nall through this episode,\n\n705\n00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:55,385\nmoving that pointer around\non my screen and clicking.\n\n706\n00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,345\nAnd a mouse is certainly one way to do it,\n\n707\n00:33:57,345 --> 00:34:00,325\nmost computers do come\nwith a mouse like this.\n\n708\n00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:03,205\nYou move the mouse, and the computer\ntranslates that into a location\n\n709\n00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:05,205\non the screen, use the buttons to click.\n\n710\n00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,680\nBut there's other choices there too.\n\n711\n00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,640\nYou might be like me and\nhate using a mouse.\n\n712\n00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,240\nThere's nothing wrong with a mouse,\nbut for\n\n713\n00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,770\nme there's just not enough room up here\non the podium, or on my desk at home.\n\n714\n00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,070\nI need something that takes less space.\n\n715\n00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,710\nSo I'm a big track ball user.\n\n716\n00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,140\nIt's actually what I've got sitting right\nhere, that i use is this, this track ball.\n\n717\n00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,370\nSo i, i just move the, the little ball.\n\n718\n00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,670\nI don't actually have to\nmove the whole device.\n\n719\n00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,790\nSo that takes a lot less space,\nand you'll see they're,\n\n720\n00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,250\nthey're not any more expensive\nthan a mouse really.\n\n721\n00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,040\nSo if i continue down my, my screen,\ni can find a track ball here.\n\n722\n00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,420\nLike this Logitech one is $30.\n\n723\n00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,310\nI think mine was $40, but you know,\nyou can find ones that are,\n\n724\n00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,370\nare far less kind of, space consuming.\n\n725\n00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,434\nSo those are, are track balls.\n\n726\n00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:52,346\nAnother option would be what we find in\na laptop, which would be a trackpad or\n\n727\n00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:56,750\na touchpad, you hear different names for\nit, and I'm sure they sell them separate.\n\n728\n00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,610\nBut normally touch pads\nare embedded on laptops.\n\n729\n00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,730\nSo when you buy a laptop, there'll be a\nlittle flat pad beneath the keyboard, and\n\n730\n00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,350\nyou move your finger over it.\n\n731\n00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,460\nBut you can buy a dedicated touchpad,\nhere's one.\n\n732\n00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,870\nAnd, with this one,\n\n733\n00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,970\nit'll be a flat reactive pad that senses\nthe electrical impulses in your finger.\n\n734\n00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,384\nAnd, it's not completely white.\n\n735\n00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,215\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is a white trackpad in\n\n736\n00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:20,379\na snowstorm-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n737\n00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:21,552\n>> And-\n\n738\n00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,620\n>> [LAUGH] What is going on here this is\n\n739\n00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,466\noh there we go.\n\n740\n00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,996\n>> We've just made that item so popular.\n\n741\n00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:27,530\n>> I know [CROSSTALK].\n\n742\n00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,376\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n743\n00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:32,960\n>> So so this is the touch pad, and you'll\nsee it's just a completely flat surface.\n\n744\n00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,620\nAnd you slide you finger over the top of\nit and it moves the mouse on the screen.\n\n745\n00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,980\nA mouse, a trackball, a touchpad, they all\nachieve the same thing, they move your\n\n746\n00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,390\ncursor around on the screen, they just\ndo it with a different type of input.\n\n747\n00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,770\nThey also call out a few others\nthat are a little less common, for\n\n748\n00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,980\nexample, a stylus pen.\n\n749\n00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,980\nIf you're a graphics artist, and you're\ndoing a lot of drawing on your computer,\n\n750\n00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,090\nyou can get a stylus that is basically a,\n\n751\n00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,830\na, a pen, instead of having ink on the end\nof it, it just has a rubber tip and\n\n752\n00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,660\nyou can write on your monitor and\nit will sense that and then draw.\n\n753\n00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,340\nSo if i do a search her for Stylus.\n\n754\n00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,990\nNow we can find that.\n\n755\n00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:16,280\nNow not every monitor supports\nusing a stylus and so\n\n756\n00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,840\nwe'll often times have to buy a particular\nmonitor designed to handle it.\n\n757\n00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,380\nAnd some how, oh i guess there's\na camera called a stylus.\n\n758\n00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,224\nYou know, let me just do a search for\nWacom tablets.\n\n759\n00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:29,797\n[SOUND] Wacom is like the market leader\nin these for graphics designers so\n\n760\n00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:34,741\nthey'll buy a special monitor that's\ndesigned to be used with these tablets,\n\n761\n00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:39,557\nor with these pens, and then you'll have\na pen where you write and draw on it.\n\n762\n00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:44,003\nWe have our graphics designer\nover here and he uses one,\n\n763\n00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:49,200\ni did click search didn't i,\ni might just switch over to google.\n\n764\n00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,790\nThis is kinda running slower and\nslower isn't it.\n\n765\n00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,590\nLet me do that.\n\n766\n00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,610\nI'll just jump over to google and\ndo an image search.\n\n767\n00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,590\nSo the Wacom Tablets so\nthey're really powerful,\n\n768\n00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,820\nthey give that ability to use a pen and\ndraw like you would naturally.\n\n769\n00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,090\nThey're just showing somebody writing.\n\n770\n00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,390\nNow on this one, it's just a flat screen\nlike a touchpad, and so you're having to\n\n771\n00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,870\nvisually match it up with the screen,\nbut the better ones are like this.\n\n772\n00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,290\nWhere you actually see the monitor,\nand you're drawing right on it, so\n\n773\n00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,680\nthat's another input method\nthat would replace a mouse.\n\n774\n00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,662\n[SOUND] All right, and the the last\none they list is the joystick.\n\n775\n00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,860\nRight.\nSometimes you gotta get work done and\n\n776\n00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,510\nit takes a joystick to do it.\n\n777\n00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,600\nSo if we do a quick search for joysticks,\nyou'll see a bunch of them over here.\n\n778\n00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,860\nJoysticks are a different type of input\nbecause these are generally what you would\n\n779\n00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,300\nuse for like piloting an aircraft or\nsomething.\n\n780\n00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,870\nSo if you play video games,\nyou might use a joystick.\n\n781\n00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,780\nAnd i, i picked an aircraft style one.\n\n782\n00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,100\nIt might be something like an XBox remote.\n\n783\n00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,900\nYou know, it, it doesn't have to be like\nthis, it could be a couple of buttons and\n\n784\n00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,090\na directional pad.\n\n785\n00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,860\nSo there's all sorts of different\ntypes of joysticks that are out there.\n\n786\n00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,590\nAnd, if i scroll down, I'll probably find\na normal one, but, oh, there was one.\n\n787\n00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,210\nShoot.\n\n788\n00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,530\nLike tat.\nSo, that's a normal one,\n\n789\n00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,230\nwhere you've got the directional pad and\nthe buttons and so on.\n\n790\n00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,475\nDifferent things, almost always used for\nvideo gaming, but not necessarily.\n\n791\n00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:14,650\n>> The $419 one was the one\nthat was impressive.\n\n792\n00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,240\n>> Or $409.\n\n793\n00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,920\nThat was.\n\n794\n00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,473\n>> It's.\n[CROSSTALK] Oh, that's because it's,\n\n795\n00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:24,143\nlike, authentic,\nfighter aircraft controls.\n\n796\n00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:25,014\n>> A Warthog joystick.\n\n797\n00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:26,843\n>> You know what, 18 people loved it.\n\n798\n00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:29,109\n>> Yeah.\n>> So somebody is buying it.\n\n799\n00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> Alright, so\n\n800\n00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,170\nthose are a couple of\ndifferent options there,\n\n801\n00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,110\nyou know, mouse, track ball, touch pad.\n\n802\n00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,540\nThose are the three really common ones.\n\n803\n00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,760\nAlright, what's our next one now,\nwe got scanners.\n\n804\n00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,640\nSo, a scanner is another type of input and\ninstead of inputting letters and\n\n805\n00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,800\nmoving a cursor,\nwe might be inputting an entire image.\n\n806\n00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,920\nSo if you've got a document and\nyou want to save it in your computer or\n\n807\n00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,110\nyou've got a photo that you took\nwith an old Polaroid camera and\n\n808\n00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,845\nyou want to get it digitally into\nyour computer, you can use a scanner.\n\n809\n00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:02,795\nAnd the way a scanner works, is you\nstick your, your document in there and\n\n810\n00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:07,675\nit feeds through, and it has, like,\nbasically a moving camera attached to it.\n\n811\n00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:11,075\nAnd it takes a picture of that whole\ndocument, and turns it into and\n\n812\n00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,220\nelectronic entity inside your computer.\n\n813\n00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,750\nso you can put pictures and\ndocuments in your system.\n\n814\n00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,730\nthere are ones that work like this that\nare rollers so you slide the paper in and\n\n815\n00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,930\nit rolls through on its own.\n\n816\n00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,630\nThere's other ones that are flat bed\nscanner and let's see here's an example of\n\n817\n00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,200\none of those, you basically just open this\ntop hatch the lay the paper on there.\n\n818\n00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,880\nIt works like a photocopier, except\ninstead of making a copy on the paper it\n\n819\n00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,060\nmakes a company on Into an image\non your computer, right?\n\n820\n00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,020\nSo scanners, they're becoming\na little less popular because\n\n821\n00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,640\nyou can get multifunction printers\nthat have a scanner also.\n\n822\n00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,708\nSo fewer people are buying\ndedicated scanners.\n\n823\n00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:53,869\nBut if you're using them commercially, if\nyou're scanning allot of stuff, you need\n\n824\n00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,750\na high quality scanner otherwise it's\ngonna need maintenance too frequently.\n\n825\n00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,625\nSo, there are some that are really\nexpensive, like this one.\n\n826\n00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,448\nAnd you might say, $434,\nI'm not paying that.\n\n827\n00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:07,875\nBut this one will be able to scan very,\nvery quickly,and scan a lot of pages\n\n828\n00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:11,269\nwithout failing, so\nthat's the important part there.\n\n829\n00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,174\nAll right, next on our list\nare microphones, and microphones,\n\n830\n00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:19,100\nthat's how we input audio.\n\n831\n00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,400\nSo if I wanna talk and have the computer\nhear, now, now why would I want that?\n\n832\n00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,700\nMaybe I want to record myself.\n\n833\n00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,620\nThat might be it.\n\n834\n00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,639\nMaybe I'm doing VOIP.\n\n835\n00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,218\nI'm doing a, a digital phone\ncall across the Internet, so\n\n836\n00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,088\nI'm talking to somebody on the other end.\n\n837\n00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,146\nMaybe I'm doing voice to text.\n\n838\n00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,789\nI talk to the computer and\nit dictates for me, right?\n\n839\n00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:38,568\nThose are all reasons I might\nwant to send audio in, and\n\n840\n00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,720\nmicrophones are what\nare going to facilitate that.\n\n841\n00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,120\nYou can get really inexpensive microphones\nthat are attached to a headset.\n\n842\n00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,350\nThose are normally not\na whole lot of money.\n\n843\n00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,060\nBut you can also get dedicated\nmicrophones that sit on your desk and\n\n844\n00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,590\nare high quality recording, so\nif you wanted to do a podcast or\n\n845\n00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,110\nsomething, you could buy these and\nhook them up.\n\n846\n00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,510\nThat's another peripheral\nthat you might choose to add.\n\n847\n00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,808\nMost laptops have\na microphone built into them.\n\n848\n00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:07,710\nMost desktops don't, and so, on desktops,\n\n849\n00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,490\nwe'll typically need to\npurchase a microphone.\n\n850\n00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:17,190\nAll right, the last one that we've got on\nour list is a webcam, and with webcams,\n\n851\n00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,790\nthis is where we input\nvideo into the camera.\n\n852\n00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,980\nNot just a picture, like a scanner would,\na single picture, but\n\n853\n00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,680\nhere moving activity.\n\n854\n00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,390\nMotion.\n\n855\n00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,680\nYou know, moving frames.\n\n856\n00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,130\nAnd, for that, we need a camera, and\n\n857\n00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,810\na webcam is simply a camera that sits\non your computer and gathers video.\n\n858\n00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:39,210\nMost laptops these days have a camera\nembedded in them, but most desktops don't.\n\n859\n00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,600\nAnd so, on a desktop computer,\nyou'll probably want to go and\n\n860\n00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,630\nbuy one if you are going to do video\nconferencing, Skype, FaceTime.\n\n861\n00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,990\nAny of those like Google Hangouts\nto be able to communicate,\n\n862\n00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,370\nwhere people can see you.\n\n863\n00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,000\nThis goes back to that tele presence\nwe talked about in another episode.\n\n864\n00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400\nWebcams aren't terribly expensive.\n\n865\n00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,790\nThey usually start around 30 bucks.\n\n866\n00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,910\nIt looks like these\nare starting around 50.\n\n867\n00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,248\nAnd they just sit on top of your\nmonitor and they point at you.\n\n868\n00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:04,100\nAnd they, they typically have\na microphone in them also cuz\n\n869\n00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,430\nit's rare that you want to show video and\nno audio.\n\n870\n00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,640\nSo you normally do both, and it will\nsit there, it'll take care of that, and\n\n871\n00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,310\nit'll throw it along.\n\n872\n00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,580\nAll right, so, those are webcams.\n\n873\n00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,080\nThere's not much variation between them.\n\n874\n00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,300\nYou'll see different qualities.\n\n875\n00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,360\nThe, the amount of megapixels is how\ndetailed the image it can create, but\n\n876\n00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,310\nsince most of the time we're\nstreaming it over the internet,\n\n877\n00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,100\nthe quality's gonna be reduced anyway.\n\n878\n00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,630\nSo it doesn't really matter.\n\n879\n00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,190\nMost of these kind of,\nkind of work the same.\n\n880\n00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,430\nBut you'll see Logitech is really\none of the big leaders here.\n\n881\n00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,870\nThey produce a ton of them.\n\n882\n00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,490\nBut there's Microsoft, Asus,\nthat one's pretty fancy.\n\n883\n00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,480\nThat must do something.\n\n884\n00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,600\nMust do like 3D video or something.\n\n885\n00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,870\n>> Depth sensor.\n\n886\n00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,849\n>> Yeah.\nIt's got more than one,\n\n887\n00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:45,620\nmore than one camera.\n\n888\n00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,324\n>> That thing's for like kinetics.\n\n889\n00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:48,390\n>> Mm.\n170 bucks, too.\n\n890\n00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,560\nA little pricey.\n\n891\n00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,145\nBut, you look at a lot of these other\nones, they're far less expensive.\n\n892\n00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:56,136\nBut you'll see some that can do 1080p,\nlike full HD video.\n\n893\n00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:59,850\nOthers can't, and that's what\nstarts to vary the price on these.\n\n894\n00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,800\nAll sorts of stuff in there.\n\n895\n00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:04,371\nThis one actually has infrared\nlights attached to it, so\n\n896\n00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,392\nit can film in the dark.\n\n897\n00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:08,280\nIf you're gonna be using this\nwebcam as a security camera,\n\n898\n00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,396\nyou may want that to be able to\nfilm in low light scenarios, and so\n\n899\n00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:14,771\nyou'll find some like that if,\nif that's something you need.\n\n900\n00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:16,651\n>> Well, for $10, you can't beat it.\n\n901\n00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:17,480\nYou know, it is 10 bucks.\n\n902\n00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480\nThat is pretty cheap.\n\n903\n00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,600\nThis one, this one has pan-tilt zoom.\n\n904\n00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,220\nThat means you can run software\nthat changes direction.\n\n905\n00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,660\nYou could be travelling, and\nyou have this monitor in your home, and so\n\n906\n00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,890\nyou can remote into it, and\nyou could pan it to the right or the left,\n\n907\n00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,480\nlook up, down, zoom in.\n\n908\n00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,440\nSo that's a lot more powerful,\nand, well, you know,\n\n909\n00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,550\nit's got a little bit of\na price tag increase there.\n\n910\n00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,930\nSo so they'll cost more because\nthey have extra functionality.\n\n911\n00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,262\n>> And the webcams are really all about\nmaking sure that you get the detail that\n\n912\n00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:48,259\nyou want and the features that\nyou want involved along with,\n\n913\n00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:52,520\nwith what you want to display when you\nare doing some type of telepresence, too.\n\n914\n00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,900\nWith all the features that\nwe've talked about, input and\n\n915\n00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,510\noutput features,\nwe're not exactly quite done yet.\n\n916\n00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,330\nBut make sure that you actually\nget what you need, and\n\n917\n00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:07,200\nbe sure that you are happy with the\nquality of what you got once you get it.\n\n918\n00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,053\nThat's pretty good.\n\n919\n00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:09,750\nCool.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n920\n00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,760\n>> Get what you need.\n\n921\n00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,260\nYou know what?\n\n922\n00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,250\nMy dad used to say you'll get what\nyou get and be glad that you got it.\n\n923\n00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,560\n>> That's right.\n>> That's kind of what he said.\n\n924\n00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,084\n>> I know.\n>> [LAUGH] Alright, so, so\n\n925\n00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:20,050\nthose are some of our input devices.\n\n926\n00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,310\nWe've seen output, and we've seen input.\n\n927\n00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,140\nOn the exam, it'll usually be\nstraightforward like that, but\n\n928\n00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,700\nin real life,\nthe lines are usually much more blurred.\n\n929\n00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,690\nWe find that most vendors\nwill combine these, and so\n\n930\n00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,840\nyou have combo devices that do input and\noutput at the same time.\n\n931\n00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,890\nAnd that's what they lead into in\nthe last part of this objective.\n\n932\n00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,130\nOur Input and output devices, and I,\n\n933\n00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,820\nI love how they start out with\nthe most ancient one, which is fax.\n\n934\n00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,530\nFax which is short for facsimile.\n\n935\n00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,670\nIt's an old telephone technology, and\n\n936\n00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,390\nwhat it would allow you to do\nis feed in a piece of paper.\n\n937\n00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,280\nIt would scan it, like a scanner.\n\n938\n00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,830\nThis is our input.\n\n939\n00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,310\nIt would then dial out over\na phone line to someone else and\n\n940\n00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,080\ndeposit the image over there, and\n\n941\n00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,510\nthe fax machine on the other end would\nreceive it and print it out on paper.\n\n942\n00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,730\nThat's the output.\n\n943\n00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,240\nSo a fax machine could input an image and\noutput an image.\n\n944\n00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,320\nIt did both.\n\n945\n00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,920\nVery few people use fax any more.\n\n946\n00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,790\nMost government agencies still do for\n\n947\n00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,360\nsubmitting forms, and, and, you know,\nthey're legally recognized.\n\n948\n00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,940\nBut, since a lot of people don't have\nregular telephone lines anymore,\n\n949\n00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,830\nfax machines aren't necessarily possible.\n\n950\n00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:32,675\nAnd email really killed it because\nI can just scan a document and\n\n951\n00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:35,080\nemail it to you, and\nI don't have to worry a fax machine and\n\n952\n00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,110\nhaving phone lines and phone numbers,\nand, and all that mess.\n\n953\n00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,870\nSo, it really is a dying breed.\n\n954\n00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,079\nYou just don't see fax machines anymore.\n\n955\n00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,856\nI wonder if we can even buy one?\n\n956\n00:45:43,856 --> 00:45:45,394\nLet's see if Newegg sells any.\n\n957\n00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:49,820\nBut, but yeah that, that's something\nthat is definitely an older technology.\n\n958\n00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,360\nLet's see if we've got any.\n\n959\n00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,410\nNow, you'll see that with some\ntechnologies where they get replaced, like\n\n960\n00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,270\nCRT's, but we do need to remember them\ncuz they can turn up from time to time.\n\n961\n00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,758\nI don't want a fax modem,\nI want a fax machine.\n\n962\n00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:02,760\nThere we go.\n\n963\n00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,350\nAll right, so some of the other\ntechnologies that are out there that\n\n964\n00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,400\nare a little less antiquated.\n\n965\n00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,900\nStorage.\n\n966\n00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,410\nYou can get external hard drives and\nexternal USB keys.\n\n967\n00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,300\nAll sorts of external\ndevices that store data.\n\n968\n00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,400\nAll right?\n\n969\n00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,610\nCD and DVD drives fall under this pattern.\n\n970\n00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,774\nThese are input and output devices.\n\n971\n00:46:22,774 --> 00:46:26,990\nThey're input in that I could\nhave data on the USB key, and\n\n972\n00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,250\nI plug it into this computer and\nI copy it to the computer.\n\n973\n00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,040\nI just input data.\n\n974\n00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,220\nOr I want to back up data on my computer,\nso I plug in my USB key and\n\n975\n00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,820\nI copy data out.\n\n976\n00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,350\nI copy data to that key and\nI pop it out and walk away.\n\n977\n00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:43,580\nSo storage counts both ways,\ninput and output, and\n\n978\n00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,360\nthat's going to include hard drives\nbecause we can get USB hard drives.\n\n979\n00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,380\nIt's gonna include other things like\nCD drives, flash memory, USB keys.\n\n980\n00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,805\nAnything that stores data like that, it's\nconsidered an input and output device.\n\n981\n00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:59,735\n>> Yeah.\nSometimes, you may actually wonder, like,\n\n982\n00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,175\nwell, why in the world would,\nwould we ever need to get one?\n\n983\n00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:07,160\nWell, if I take, for example,\nmy laptop, there is no DVD drive.\n\n984\n00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,390\nThere's no extra device that actually\nallows me to boot up from a DVD, and\n\n985\n00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,800\nif you happen to need one of those, that's\nwhat you're gonna do, is you're gonna get\n\n986\n00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,470\nan external device that will allow\nto plug in through the USB port.\n\n987\n00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,050\nAnd that way, you can pull, or\ninstall directly from media, or\n\n988\n00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,930\nyou can, use that, of course,\nthen to copy things over in as a writer.\n\n989\n00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,100\n>> Now, CompTIA did add one neat little\none to it, which is a smart phone.\n\n990\n00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,590\nMost of our phones these\ndays have storage on board.\n\n991\n00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,290\nAnd if you attach your\nphone to the computer,\n\n992\n00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,450\nyou can copy data to the phone or\nfrom the phone.\n\n993\n00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,570\nIt'll show up as, well, like a USB key.\n\n994\n00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,160\nRight?\n\n995\n00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,140\nWell, a lot of them.\n\n996\n00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,630\nThe Android ones will\nshow us as a USB key.\n\n997\n00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,835\nYou can just copy data,\nand it's no big deal.\n\n998\n00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:53,208\nThe iPhones, for those you've gotta use,\nlike, iTunes, or whatever.\n\n999\n00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,833\nBut you can copy data to them and\nget data back off.\n\n1000\n00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:59,417\n>> So those can be used for storage too,\nbut they all work the same way.\n\n1001\n00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:03,460\nIt's just media, we can copy\ndata to it and get it back out.\n\n1002\n00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,670\nNow the very last entry that they have for\nus here is a touchscreen display.\n\n1003\n00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,313\nWe've talked a little bit about\ntouchscreen displays in some of our other\n\n1004\n00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:17,554\nsegments, but a display, a monitor,\nwe've already said that's output, right?\n\n1005\n00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:21,340\nWe're getting video output, so we can\nsee what's going on in the computer.\n\n1006\n00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,445\nBut when we make it a touchscreen, now\nwe're touching it and we're sending input.\n\n1007\n00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,830\nWe're sending our signals into the device\nto make it receive our signal and\n\n1008\n00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,509\nstart to do things, right?\n\n1009\n00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,486\nSo that is the,\nthe blurring of the lines and\n\n1010\n00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:41,080\nyou'll see a lot of computers these days\nare starting to come with touchscreens.\n\n1011\n00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,230\nIf you buy a laptop,\nit's usually an option, you know,\n\n1012\n00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,022\nyou can't replace the monitor on a laptop\nor at least not in any reasonable form.\n\n1013\n00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:54,261\nBut but on a desktop, it's as simple\nas going out and buying a new monitor.\n\n1014\n00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:58,160\nSo here is a 23 inch Acer monitor for\n$350, it's got a touchscreen.\n\n1015\n00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,400\nAnd the touchscreen really is just\na type of mouse, you know, i, i,\n\n1016\n00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,810\nit's taking your finger and moving\nthe mouse cursor wherever your finger is.\n\n1017\n00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,950\nSo when you hook this up,\nyou'll have your regular monitor cable and\n\n1018\n00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,630\nyou'll usually have a USB cable also,\nwhich is how interprets the touch and\n\n1019\n00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,140\nbrings it in and that's what I\ndid with my computer at home.\n\n1020\n00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,451\nI just went and bought a monitor that\nactually had touch support in it and\n\n1021\n00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:19,013\nI got that.\n\n1022\n00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:20,994\nAnd now, I don't use it, so\nit was kind of a waste of money.\n\n1023\n00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:22,909\nBut if, if you like that, right?\n\n1024\n00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:26,291\nYou can, you're in business, but\n\n1025\n00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:30,930\nthat makes it both an input and\nan output device.\n\n1026\n00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,603\nAll right.\n\n1027\n00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:34,735\nAnd I was surprised they didn't\nmention multifunction printers.\n\n1028\n00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:38,511\nThe multifunction printers are ones\nwhere you've got a printer that also has\n\n1029\n00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:41,430\na scanner and copier on it and\nthose are input output.\n\n1030\n00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,264\nThey're input, cuz they have the scanner,\nyou can feed data in.\n\n1031\n00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:47,405\nAnd their output, cuz they can print,\nyou get data out and\n\n1032\n00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:49,560\nthose are very common too.\n\n1033\n00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,005\nI know a lot of people\naren't big fans of them,\n\n1034\n00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:54,330\ncuz if one piece breaks the,\nthe whole thing kinda breaks, but but\n\n1035\n00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,630\nthey are fairly popular and\ninexpensive these days.\n\n1036\n00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,426\n>> Yeah, and that's the key is\nthe inexpensive part with so\n\n1037\n00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:03,166\nmany different functions, doesn't\ntake up as much desk, desktop space.\n\n1038\n00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,909\nSo, if you're not really into\nneeding it heavily all the time, but\n\n1039\n00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:10,193\njust the occasional use for\ncopying and, and even faxing,\n\n1040\n00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:14,150\nthen you have all the devices right\nthere and you, they're on demand.\n\n1041\n00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,252\n>> All right.\nWell, I doubt we've covered any input and\n\n1042\n00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:20,550\noutput devices that were shocking and\nnew to you.\n\n1043\n00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,939\nRight?\nMost of these are pretty,\n\n1044\n00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:25,646\npretty run of the mill average things, but\nthese are the ones that are going to show\n\n1045\n00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,544\nup on the exam, so we need to be\nfamiliar with them and kind of know\n\n1046\n00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:32,500\nthe differences, so that we understand\nwhen one is appropriate versus another.\n\n1047\n00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,785\nSo just keep that in mind as\nyou prepare to take the exam.\n\n1048\n00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:37,558\nAll right.\nWell that's a pretty good spot for\n\n1049\n00:50:37,558 --> 00:50:39,560\nus to wrap up, wrap up this objective.\n\n1050\n00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,911\nLet me remind you guys, if you have\nany questions, just let us know.\n\n1051\n00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:45,717\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1052\n00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,936\nyou'll

00:00:38,425\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:40,885\nI'm your host Don Pezent,\nback with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:41,570\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,020\n>> It is going well today.\n\n7\n00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,370\nToday is Thursday, so\nthat must mean it's throwback Thursday.\n\n8\n00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,330\n>> Throwback Thursday.\n\n9\n00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,010\n>> And so we are going old school and\nwe're talking about cables and connectors,\n\n10\n00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,580\nand everything that an IT pro needs\nto know about cables and connectors.\n\n11\n00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,230\nSo we're gonna take a dive into that realm\nand see some of the most common ones.\n\n12\n00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,250\n>> Yeah, remember, one of the objectives\non the exam that we're gonna hit later,\n\n13\n00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,960\nthe last domain, IT literacy.\n\n14\n00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,780\nOne of the things they expect you to know\nis how to take a computer out of the box\n\n15\n00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,430\nand hook up all the cables.\n\n16\n00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,040\nSo we probably need to\nbe able to recognize\n\n17\n00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,620\nwhat cables belong to what\ntype of a connection.\n\n18\n00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,450\nAnd that's exactly what\nExam Objective 2.2 is all about.\n\n19\n00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,710\nThe official objective is compare and\ncontrast common computer connector types.\n\n20\n00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,270\nAll right.\n\n21\n00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,040\nNow, there are a lot of connectors,\nand I guess it depends.\n\n22\n00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,580\nIf you look at a laptop, you might\nonly have one thing connected to it,\n\n23\n00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,720\njust the power cable and that's it.\n\n24\n00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,890\nBut when you look at the back of\na desktop, you may have a ton of cabling.\n\n25\n00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,800\nMy computer at home is\na nightmare of cables behind it.\n\n26\n00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,460\nSo what are all those cables and\nwhat are they connecting us to?\n\n27\n00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,110\n>> At one time when we built\nour own computers way back,\n\n28\n00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,360\nI'll use the term that we always\nuse around here, back in the day,\n\n29\n00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,220\nwe had relatively few cables\nthat we really dealt with.\n\n30\n00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,970\nPower, and then a connector to the monitor\nand maybe a mouse and a keyboard.\n\n31\n00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,734\nBut now that we've advanced into\nthe end of the first decade or\n\n32\n00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:12,139\nof the 21st century, it's amazing\nabout how many different cables\n\n33\n00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,010\nare actually out there for\nreally connecting the same things.\n\n34\n00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,564\nBecause we're actually moving in so\nmany different types and\n\n35\n00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:21,723\nthis is something we've got\nto be able to identify,\n\n36\n00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:25,170\nand you're gonna be working with\nthem more often than you realize.\n\n37\n00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,317\n>> Yeah so, CompTIA lists about\n11 different types of cables.\n\n38\n00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:34,890\nBut for video, for\nthe display connector, they actually\n\n39\n00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,990\nbranch that out into sub categories, and\nthey have seven different cables for that.\n\n40\n00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,130\nAnd I guess I should have brought up\nthe actual exam objective here to show us.\n\n41\n00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,590\nBut they break that one out because video\nis where it's really gotten complex.\n\n42\n00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,570\nThere are so many different types\nof video cables that are available.\n\n43\n00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,520\nSo, we're gonna show you each of them.\n\n44\n00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,910\nWell, almost all of them.\n\n45\n00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,700\nCompTIA does call out some really old ones\nthat we'll just have to show a picture of.\n\n46\n00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,270\nBut let me just jump down\nhere to exam objective 2.2.\n\n47\n00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,730\nThere it is.\n\n48\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,090\nAnd so you'll se we've got video, and\n\n49\n00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,880\nhere's seven different types of video\ncable that you might have on your system.\n\n50\n00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,790\nAnd then after that, we've got a couple\nother normal data type cables and\n\n51\n00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,160\nthose that are kind of\nlisted beyond there.\n\n52\n00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,500\nBut video has become really complex.\n\n53\n00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,820\nSo let's start there, Ronnie.\n\n54\n00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,280\nWe'll just take these video connectors and\nwe'll kind of break down each one and\n\n55\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,620\nshow what they do and what they're for.\n\n56\n00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,150\nAnd that very first one,\nVGA, up until maybe five or\n\n57\n00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,960\nsix years ago,\nthis was the de facto standard.\n\n58\n00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,210\nSo when you were attaching a monitor to\na computer, a VGA cable is what you'd use.\n\n59\n00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,790\nIn today's world, there's newer cables\nthat are better, do higher resolution,\n\n60\n00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,510\nsharper video, but\nbecause VGA was so common,\n\n61\n00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,660\nyou still see it all over the place,\nyou still see it in a lot of systems.\n\n62\n00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,460\nAnd it's rare to find a computer that\ndoesn't at least have a VGA connector.\n\n63\n00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,150\nIt's kind of the one you can count on,\n\n64\n00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,980\nthat almost every system Is going\nto have that VGA connector.\n\n65\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,140\nSo Ronnie, let's take a look at that.\n\n66\n00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,020\nWhat does that VGA connector look like?\n\n67\n00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,676\n>> A VGA connector,\nas we go to our famous Sky Cam here,\n\n68\n00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:17,664\nwe end up having a fairly short cable,\nusually about 18 inches or so,\n\n69\n00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,380\nbut you end up seeing that there-\n>> It's 18 inches?\n\n70\n00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,888\n>> Or is it-\n>> That's like a foot and a half, Ronnie,\n\n71\n00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,950\nyou have video cables a foot and a half?\n\n72\n00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,000\n>> I'm lying to you.\n\n73\n00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,945\nYeah, maybe longer.\n\n74\n00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't what I was thinking I\n\n75\n00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,783\nhad 18 inches in.\n\n76\n00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm wrong on that one.\n\n77\n00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,620\n>> I don't wanna know\nwhat you were thinking.\n\n78\n00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,800\n>> Yeah.\nSo, they're fairly long.\n\n79\n00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,590\n>> They'll normally be pretty long, cuz\nyour computer might be under the table,\n\n80\n00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,080\nand the monitor up above, so\n\n81\n00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480\nit could be a six-foot cable,\nit could be a three-foot cable.\n\n82\n00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,532\n18 inches would be impressive.\n\n83\n00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,230\n>> I don't know what I was thinking.\n\n85\n00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,180\n>> That's what I'm here for,\nRonnie, keeping you honest.\n\n86\n00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,310\n>> I think I was thinking of SATA or\nsomething.\n\n87\n00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,850\nI don't know.\n\n88\n00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,630\nWho knows?\n\n89\n00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,890\nSo usually they're 15 pin connectors.\n\n90\n00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,650\nAnd a lot of times, just a default,\nthey're colored blue.\n\n91\n00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,408\nIt doesn't mean that they have to be,\nbut most people have accepted that.\n\n92\n00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,620\nAnd when they make cables, you tend\nto find that these connectors, and\n\n93\n00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,490\nthey also have these nice little\nscrew in types that allow the cable\n\n94\n00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,750\nitself to be plugged in and anchored in so\nthey don't wiggle themselves out.\n\n95\n00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,960\nSo usually we put a couple of turns\non them to make sure as people\n\n96\n00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,690\nmove the computer around or\nthe monitor around, it doesn't end\n\n97\n00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,250\nup wiggling out of it's position and\nso usually, that's what we see.\n\n98\n00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,720\n>> And you've really got to have that\nbecause if you think of a power outlet,\n\n99\n00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760\nyou just have two pins that you stick in.\n\n100\n00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,330\nI guess, actually maybe a three,\nthat go into the wall outlet and\n\n101\n00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,880\nthat kind of holds it in place.\n\n102\n00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,850\nBut on these, you've got 15 pins in there,\nall those little tiny pins.\n\n103\n00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,540\nI know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n104\n00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,350\nBut they're all in these little copper,\nbrass pins.\n\n105\n00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,410\nI think they're all copper.\n\n106\n00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,970\nAnd each one has to be seated properly or\nyour display will mess up.\n\n107\n00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,600\nYou'll lose a color or\nit just won't work at all.\n\n108\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,130\nSo those thumb screws tighten it in place,\nand\n\n109\n00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,950\nthis thing isn't coming out as\nlong as those screws are in place.\n\n110\n00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,060\nNice thing to remember is you don't\nhave to actually tighten them down so\n\n112\n00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,685\ntight that you'll never get them loose.\n\n113\n00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The goal of course is\n\n114\n00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,660\njust to snug them down.\n\n115\n00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,170\nMake them tight but don't make them so\ntight that when you go and\n\n116\n00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,300\ntry to reach for them,\nyou need a pair of pliers to unscrew them.\n\n117\n00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,050\n>> Does this cable have it running\nwhere the other end of the thumb\n\n118\n00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,510\nscrew actually has a gouge\nin it like a channel?\n\n119\n00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,100\n>> Sure does.\n\n120\n00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,800\n>> Yeah, a lot of times they'll\nput a channel in there and\n\n121\n00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,090\nit looks like a screwdriver, like\na Phillips head or a flathead screwdriver.\n\n122\n00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,490\n>> That doesn't mean you should use one,\nright?\n\n123\n00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,330\nYou should just do them finger-tight,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,460\nTighten them with your hand.\n\n125\n00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,490\nBut if you ever go to undo one that's\nbeen screwed in place for years,\n\n126\n00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,310\nit can be really hard, and so\nthey put those grooves in there so\n\n127\n00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,190\nthat you can use a coin or\na screwdriver to loosen them up.\n\n128\n00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,090\nBut they are just plastic, so if you put\ntoo much torque on there, you'll strip it\n\n129\n00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,890\nout real easy, so it's not intended\nto be used like that very frequently.\n\n130\n00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,640\nNow this is the cable end\nof the connector, and\n\n131\n00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,330\nthis is considered a male cable\nbecause you've got the pins.\n\n132\n00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,860\nThe other side of this is going to be\nthe connector that's the female connector.\n\n133\n00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,850\nAnd so instead of pins, it's gonna\nhave grooves these pins fit into.\n\n134\n00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,050\nThis cable is almost always\ncolored blue on the ends.\n\n135\n00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,530\nAnd they follow that same idea\non the other end of the cable.\n\n136\n00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,590\nIf we take a, well you know what, mine's,\nI'm about to show one that's not blue.\n\n137\n00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,822\nOn the other end of the cable,\non your computer where this plugs into,\n\n138\n00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:18,890\nyou can spot those VGA connectors real\nquickly because they're blue too.\n\n139\n00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,610\nSo the blue cable goes in the blue port,\n\n140\n00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,790\nbut the color is not something we can\ncount on, especially not on the exam.\n\n141\n00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,120\nIn real life, that cable could be\nany of a number of colors, and\n\n142\n00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,600\nto kind of reinforce that,\nI've got a little VGA\n\n143\n00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,850\nadapter here that I use all the time\non my laptop, and it's gray.\n\n144\n00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,460\nSo what you really need to be able\nto recognize is that you got 15 pins\n\n145\n00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,890\narrayed in three rows.\n\n146\n00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,510\nThat's what a VGA connector looks like.\n\n147\n00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,350\nAll right, now the VGA standard\nwas created forever ago, and\n\n148\n00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,600\nmonitors back then were almost all\nrunning at the 640 by 480 resolution.\n\n149\n00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,592\nAnd that meant if you were to count\nthe little dots that light up your screen,\n\n150\n00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:03,145\nthere were 640 of them wide and 480 of\nthem tall, and that made up your screen.\n\n151\n00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:06,565\nAnd all those dots would arrange to\nform your letters and numbers and\n\n152\n00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,008\nall the good stuff, right?\n\n153\n00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:12,078\nWell that's not very big, 640 x 480.\n\n154\n00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:17,752\nIn today's world, it's very common for\nthem to be 1,900,\n\n155\n00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:22,199\nlet's see, 1,920 wide by 1,080 tall.\n\n156\n00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,897\nThat's one of the most\ncommon resolutions today\n\n157\n00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,530\nwhich is well over double what\nthe old systems used to be.\n\n158\n00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,950\nSo these VGA cables,\nwhile they worked just fine, there\n\n159\n00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,780\nwere some things they couldn't handle,\nespecially these higher resolutions.\n\n160\n00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,290\nAnd so they had to find something better.\n\n161\n00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,150\nThe main thing that was holding\na VGA cable back is it was analog.\n\n162\n00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,760\nIt worked by sending electrical\nimpulses across a line, and\n\n163\n00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,980\nthen your monitor would render them\nbased on these analog signals.\n\n164\n00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,560\nWith our newer cables,\nwe switch to digital.\n\n165\n00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,960\nWe're actually sending ones and\nzeros across the line and\n\n166\n00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,950\nthe monitor on the other side is able\nto recognize that and render it.\n\n167\n00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,820\nAnd that way you get a sharper,\nclearer image, and\n\n168\n00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,730\nyou can handle much bigger resolutions.\n\n169\n00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,890\nSo VGA cables are kind of going away.\n\n170\n00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,640\nThey're still the most common\nconnector out there and so\n\n171\n00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,790\nlike if I go to give\na presentation somewhere.\n\n172\n00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,500\nI go and give talks now and then.\n\n173\n00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,210\nI'll take my laptop and\nI'll say, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,310\nI'm gonna go plug into a projector, so\n\n175\n00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,290\nthat I can show some stuff on my laptop\nto the people that I'm talking to,\n\n176\n00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,750\nand I'll always make sure to\ngrab my little VGA adapter.\n\n177\n00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,760\nThis thing right here.\n\n178\n00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,420\nCuz I can stick it on my laptop,\nand I know, no matter what kind of\n\n179\n00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,760\nprojector they have out there, it's\nmore than likely gonna have VGA on it.\n\n180\n00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,380\n>> The VGA connector,\nwhen you do see it, and\n\n181\n00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,720\nwhen you see it on most of the display,\nflat panel displays,\n\n182\n00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,200\nyou'll see that there may have more than\none connector but just by standard you'll\n\n183\n00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,420\nnormally see at least that, and a lot\nof times, on even on the, I won't say\n\n184\n00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,130\neconomy class, entry level PCs, you'll see\nthat if they don't have anything else,\n\n185\n00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,150\nthey'll at least have that one built\nright in to be able to plug into.\n\n186\n00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,260\nSo it's not that it'd give you\na bad picture overall, but\n\n187\n00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,600\nit's usually the lowest quality that we're\ngonna end up seeing in a regular PC today.\n\n188\n00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,240\n>> Now VGA was replaced by\na newer standard called DVI.\n\n189\n00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,620\nAnd that's the digital video interface.\n\n190\n00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,440\nAnd DVI worked very similar to VGA,\nexcept it was digital so\n\n191\n00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,180\nit can handle much higher resolutions and\nsend a much more sharper, crisper image.\n\n192\n00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,020\nAnd this is one that we saw\ngetting adopted very early\n\n193\n00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,420\non when flat screens\nwere becoming popular.\n\n194\n00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,840\nAnd so, a lot of people will prefer\nto go DVI over VGA and they should.\n\n195\n00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,710\nYou image will be brighter,\nyour colors will be more realistic.\n\n196\n00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,580\nIt's a better standard all in all.\n\n197\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,720\nSo if you have to choose between the two,\nDVI is the better choice.\n\n198\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,880\n>> The DVI cable pretty much looks a lot\nlike this and the default color for\n\n199\n00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,870\nmost of them are gonna be\nwhite in its connector.\n\n200\n00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,940\nAnd you'll see that the other end still\nhas the same kind of configuration.\n\n201\n00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,070\nWe have pins on one side and\nthis is gonna be a male connector for us.\n\n202\n00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,820\nAnd then we have these thumb\nscrews that help us to lock in.\n\n203\n00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,620\nNow what Don was mentioning earlier about\n\n204\n00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,500\nthe thumb screw getting tightened\ntoo tight, and they can strip out.\n\n205\n00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,260\nI noticed the one that I pulled here, and\n\n206\n00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,850\nyou can see where there's actually\nthis pin sticking out here.\n\n207\n00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,440\nThat's not normal.\n\n208\n00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,660\n>> That's not supposed to come out.\n\n209\n00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,840\n>> That's not supposed to come out and\n\n210\n00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,190\nwhat somebody actually end up doing is\nthey actually tightened it so much and\n\n211\n00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,620\nI can see it just a little bit here, where\nyou can see where this connect the screw.\n\n212\n00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,760\n>> They used a screwdriver.\n\n213\n00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,320\n>> They used a screwdriver and\nthey had to torque it a little bit and\n\n214\n00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,770\nit ended up actually\npulling that screw out.\n\n215\n00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,870\nIt's so tight that I can't actually\nmanually hold that there and, and\n\n216\n00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,870\nturn it out.\n\n217\n00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,760\nSo yeah, when you go too tight that,\nthat's what you see.\n\n218\n00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,570\nSo you'll see this is much more\ncommon today on these DVIs.\n\n219\n00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,700\nMost systems today will probably\nhave this as a connector.\n\n220\n00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,430\n>> Now the neat thing about DVI is that\nwhen they designed it they made it\n\n221\n00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,670\nbackwards compatible with VGA.\n\n222\n00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,750\nSo DVI can operate in a digital mode and\nan analogue mode.\n\n223\n00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,280\nNow, in analogue mode you actually\nlose a lot of the benefits of DVI.\n\n224\n00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,600\nSo that's not really recommended.\n\n225\n00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,050\nThey don't want you to do\nthat if you don't have to.\n\n226\n00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,240\nBut they do sell these\nlittle DVI to VGA adapters.\n\n227\n00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,710\nSo if you're computer has a VGA and\n\n228\n00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,050\na DVI port, you can stick an adapter\nonto it and now you have two VGA ports,\n\n229\n00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,600\nwhich is useful if you want to have\ntwo monitors on your computer.\n\n230\n00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,710\nBut notice on his DVI cable there\non the far side, there is not so\n\n231\n00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,880\nmuch a pin as it is like a bar or\njust like a wide plate, right.\n\n232\n00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,240\nThat pin right there is what's going\nto determine whether this cable can do\n\n233\n00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,000\ndigital or analog, all right.\n\n234\n00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,760\nWhen it's arrayed like that\nwhere it's just the bar and\n\n235\n00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,690\nthere's no pins around it,\nthat means it can do both.\n\n236\n00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,260\nIt can do digital and analog.\n\n237\n00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,560\nBut there are times where there'll\nbe some pins that surround it.\n\n238\n00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,040\nAnd when you have those pins,\n\n239\n00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,780\nthat's what's telling us that\nit's gonna do analog only.\n\n240\n00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,530\nSo when you see a VGA or\nDVI connector, right?\n\n241\n00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,260\n>> That one's digital only.\n\n242\n00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,290\n>> If we look at this connector here,\nthis is the female side of it that\n\n243\n00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,120\nthe cable fits into and see how I've\ngot all these holes for the pin and\n\n244\n00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,180\nthen there's this little slot right\nhere and there's no holes around it.\n\n245\n00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,180\nThat means this will do digital only,\njust digital, and I think,\n\n246\n00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,340\nas I drop it, my little DVI adapter that\nI use on my laptop, let me grab that.\n\n247\n00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n248\n00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,280\n>> Mine is also, sorry guys,\nlet me just bring this up here.\n\n249\n00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,610\nMine is also just digital only,\nI don't do analog, right.\n\n250\n00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,010\nAnd look at Ronny's cable now.\n\n251\n00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,830\n>> And you can see that this one actually\nhas a couple of other pins around.\n\n252\n00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,487\nAnd actually, there's four surrounding\npins around that little blade.\n\n253\n00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:49,190\nAnd this one will do the analogue.\n\n254\n00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,548\n>> If you can get the light just\nright you can see the pins.\n\n255\n00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:52,513\n>> That's what I'm trying to do,\n\n256\n00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,990\nis just trying to see if we can\njust shine it a little bit better.\n\n257\n00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,910\nThat's as good as I can get, right there.\n\n258\n00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,840\n>> So, there are times where you might\nhave a DVI cable and a DVI connector and\n\n259\n00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,540\nthey won't fit.\n\n260\n00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,780\nThey won't connect and\nthe reason is those little pins around it.\n\n261\n00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,650\nYou've got an analog cable try to plug\nit into a digital only connector.\n\n262\n00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,300\nSo that does happen and you've gotta\nbe careful when you choose that.\n\n263\n00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,450\nThe VGA to DVI adapters are always\nanalog because the VGA side is analog so\n\n264\n00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,500\nthat connector is only going\nto work in that one mode and\n\n265\n00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,760\nit won't work with every port that's out\nthere so just be aware of that difference.\n\n266\n00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,450\nYou'll also notice, where's\nthe original cable you had, Ronnie?\n\n267\n00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:29,950\n>> Right here.\n\n268\n00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,130\n>> If you look at it, see how there's this\ngiant gap between the pins right here?\n\n269\n00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,980\nSo you can see there's\na cluster of nine pins and\n\n270\n00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,800\nthen another cluster of nine pins,\nand there's a gap in between.\n\n271\n00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,140\nBut when you look at one of our\nconnectors, we kind of arranged them so\n\n272\n00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,520\nthey're lines up like they're plugged in.\n\n273\n00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,820\nNotice how there's no gap up here.\n\n274\n00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,090\nAll right, that's perfectly fine.\n\n275\n00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,780\nWith DVI, they actually designed\nit to where you could have\n\n276\n00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,410\ntwo DVI signals on the same port for\n\n277\n00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,490\npeople that wanted to have two\nmonitors attached to their computer.\n\n278\n00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,640\nSo some systems will have a connector on\nthem where all of the pins are present.\n\n279\n00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,160\nAnd that's one that should not be run to a\nsingle monitor, it'll have an adapter that\n\n280\n00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,270\nsplits it out into two and runs it\nto the monitors that are available.\n\n281\n00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,670\nBut on a normal DVI connector,\nyou will see a gap, and that's fine.\n\n282\n00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,250\nIt'll plug in, and those pins are just not\npresent and the monitor that this connects\n\n283\n00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,910\nto, well, it'll just get the one\nsignal coming out of the system.\n\n284\n00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,110\nThat's all you when you're\nrunning to a single monitor.\n\n285\n00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,740\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,170\nSo that's DVI.\n\n287\n00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,840\nDigital video interface.\n\n288\n00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,830\nNow both of those cables are video only.\n\n289\n00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,200\nThey carry a video signal and that's it.\n\n290\n00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,790\nWell, as time went on the powers that be,\nthe people that design cables decided\n\n291\n00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,920\nthat wouldn't it be nice if we had a cable\nthat carried both video and audio.\n\n292\n00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,692\nNow in computers, a lot of time our\nmonitors are just a monitor and that's it,\n\n293\n00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,308\nbut in home entertainment,\nlike home theaters and stuff,\n\n294\n00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,590\nyou normally have a tv that\ndisplays video and audio.\n\n295\n00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,507\nIt has speakers in it.\n\n296\n00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,258\nSo it'd be nice if you could\ncarry all that in one cable.\n\n297\n00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:13,835\nSo they designed a new cable called HDMI.\n\n298\n00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:18,510\nAnd that's the High Definition\nMultimedia Interface, HDMI.\n\n299\n00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,790\nAnd this is considered\nthe standard cable of today.\n\n300\n00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,940\nIf you're going out and\nbuying a monitor right now.\n\n301\n00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,480\nGoing out and buying a TV right now, you\nwanna look for HDMI ports on it, right?\n\n302\n00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,700\nThat's the one that we want today.\n\n303\n00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,830\nYou'll still find tons of VGA and\nDVI out there, and when you buy a monitor,\n\n304\n00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,710\noftentimes you'll have a VGA And\nHDMI or a combination of them.\n\n305\n00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,740\nSome of the monitors we have over here,\noff camera, have all three, VGA,\n\n306\n00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,530\nDVI, and HDMI.\n\n307\n00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,860\nSo that's not uncommon either.\n\n308\n00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,090\nBut this cable, it looks different.\n\n309\n00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,640\nIt functions a lot like the others,\nbut it carries video and audio.\n\n310\n00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,050\nNow you might notice there's no\nthumb screws on these cables.\n\n311\n00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,130\nThey're a lot smaller.\n\n312\n00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,880\nAll right?\n\n313\n00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,920\nThey forewent having pins on the cables.\n\n314\n00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,280\nSo there's no pins on these like\nwhat we see on the other adaptors.\n\n315\n00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,980\nAnd so it's got plastic\ninside of the connector and\n\n316\n00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,320\nthere's various slots inside of it and\n\n317\n00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,480\ncopper pads that create the contact that\nwe need and it creates its own pressure.\n\n318\n00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,570\nWhen you pop it into a port,\nit applies a little bit of pressure and\n\n319\n00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,090\nit holds itself in.\n\n320\n00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,500\nNow, you can yank it out,\nyou can trip over it so\n\n321\n00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700\nit's not as secure as the thumbscrew,\n\n322\n00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,580\nbut most of us aren't moving these kind of\ndevices around, so it's not a big deal.\n\n323\n00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,050\nSo there's no thumbscrews anymore, these\njust pop right into an HDMI port, and\n\n324\n00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,880\nthat's it, and I've got an example\nof an HDMI port right here.\n\n325\n00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680\nAnd you'll notice if you look,\n\n326\n00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,240\nthere's a bunch of little copper kind\nof around the edges of that port.\n\n327\n00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,430\nAnd then in the middle there's\na white piece of plastic, all right?\n\n328\n00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,540\nThat white piece of plastic\nhas copper leads on it, too,\n\n329\n00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,620\nwhich are basically taking\nthe place of those pins.\n\n330\n00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,080\nAnd on Ronnie's cable there,\n\n331\n00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,200\nthe black cable,\nhe's got a empty slot in the middle.\n\n332\n00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,330\nAnd so\nthose two were gonna fit together, and\n\n333\n00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,120\nthen all the copper pads will be lined up\nand the pressure that the port creates\n\n334\n00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,150\nwill cause the copper ports to come in\ncontact and your signal crosses along.\n\n335\n00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:16,950\nSo HDMI, pretty simple, and\nit carries video and audio.\n\n336\n00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,380\nIt's digital and\nit can do high definition just fine.\n\n337\n00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,450\nIt can do very high resolutions and\nmove quite a bit of data.\n\n338\n00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,280\n>> Now, when the HDMI, you also see\nthat there's variations of this, too,\n\n339\n00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,870\nlike a mini-HDMI cable, too.\n\n340\n00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,520\nYou may see a very small\nversion of this by comparison.\n\n341\n00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,645\nAnd if you're wondering if they\nwork the same they do, but\n\n342\n00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:37,905\nit's just a mini version of it.\n\n343\n00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:41,445\n>> And you'll see that like on camcorders,\nvideo recorders.\n\n344\n00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,465\nYou might see it on tablets.\n\n345\n00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:48,820\nRight, so a lot of tables can be hooked\nup to a television to output your data.\n\n346\n00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,160\nAnd so they might have a miniport on them,\nbut a lot of systems will have a full-size\n\n347\n00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,390\nport just because full-size\ncables are more common.\n\n348\n00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,820\nYou don't want to have to go out and\nbuy a cable just for this.\n\n349\n00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,200\nNow, James just mentioned\nin the chat room, and\n\n350\n00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200\nthis is kinda important,\nHDMI did something more, all right.\n\n351\n00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,260\nTo us as the consumer we're like,\noh it carries video and audio.\n\n352\n00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,800\nThat's nice.\n\n353\n00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,960\nAnd it's digital, so hey, that's pretty\ncool, I should go to that, right?\n\n354\n00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,750\nWell the MPAA, the Motion Picture\nAssociation of America and\n\n355\n00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,852\nseveral other content producers,\n\n356\n00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:24,890\nwhen HDMI was being developed, they said\nboy, wouldn't it be nice if we could have\n\n357\n00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,000\ndigital rights management built\ninto the cable, and so they did.\n\n358\n00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,790\nAnd there's this, it's called HDCP,\n\n359\n00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,920\nthe High Definition Copyright Protection,\nand it, or Content Protection?\n\n360\n00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320\nShoot, I always forget that one,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n361\n00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,340\nIt's not on the exam.\n\n362\n00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,700\nBut it's this copy protection that's\nbuilt into the HDMI standard.\n\n363\n00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,740\nAnd so when you plug an HDMI cable in,\nnot only is it able to carry video and\n\n364\n00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,430\naudio, it's also able to\ncarry a signal to say whether\n\n365\n00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,620\nyou have permission to re-transmit.\n\n366\n00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,460\nAnd, it's kind of unfortunate,\nbecause there's a lot of times\n\n367\n00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,790\nwhere you'll hook a laptop up to a TV, and\nyou won't be able to stream a video or\n\n368\n00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,740\nshow what you want because of\nthe copy protection that's in it.\n\n369\n00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,700\nDVI and VGA don't have copy protection\non them, and so it always works.\n\n370\n00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,960\nHDMI can be hit or miss, and\nover the years they've upgraded it.\n\n371\n00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,380\nSo, there were the original HDMI cables,\nand there was HDMI 1.1, and 1.2.\n\n372\n00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,960\nAnd what James was mentioning in\nthe chat room is version 1.4B, right?\n\n373\n00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,200\nThat's kind of the main standard right\nnow if you're buying new equipment.\n\n374\n00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,840\nSo, that does come into play and\nit makes things a lot more complex because\n\n375\n00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,100\nwhen you look at this cable,\nwhich HDMI standard is it?\n\n376\n00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,650\nI have no idea.\n\n377\n00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,075\nAnd a lot of times just from visual\ninspections you can't tell and\n\n378\n00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:40,865\nit's not just the cable that comes into\nplay, it's the devices on the two ends.\n\n379\n00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,355\nAnd you can get some really fancy ones.\n\n380\n00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:47,775\nI had one that carried not only audio and\nvideo but also carried network.\n\n381\n00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,475\nAnd the idea was that if you're\nplugging your computer into a TV,\n\n382\n00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:56,020\nthe TV could get network access through\nyour computer via the HDMI cable so\n\n383\n00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,970\nyou'll see variations like that.\n\n384\n00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,110\nHDMI is very powerful.\n\n385\n00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,070\nIt's not going anywhere anytime soon so\nit's gonna be around a while.\n\n386\n00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,830\nBecause they designed\nit to be upgradeable,\n\n387\n00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,140\nthey could add new\nfeatures to it over time.\n\n388\n00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,400\nThe cable itself doesn't actually change.\n\n389\n00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,040\nHardly at all.\n\n390\n00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,970\nSome of them actually have a little\nbit of shielding in them when\n\n391\n00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,340\nthey do multiple things but, for\nthe most part, they don't change much.\n\n392\n00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,040\nIt's the systems on the other end that do.\n\n393\n00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,310\nThose three right there are what\nI consider to be the standard,\n\n394\n00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,490\nyou can expect to see them regularly.\n\n395\n00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,470\nConnectors.\n\n396\n00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,100\nBut there is plenty of other ones\nthat are a little less common.\n\n397\n00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,102\nWhat's the next one on our list.\n\n398\n00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:34,995\n>> Next one we have display port or\nthunderbolt.\n\n399\n00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,330\n>> All right, this is the first one\nthat we'll encounter that has two names,\n\n400\n00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,570\ndisplay port and thunderbolt.\n\n401\n00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,870\nSo what's that all about?\n\n402\n00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,620\nWell, the display port connector\nhas been around for a while.\n\n403\n00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,600\nA lot of laptops use it.\n\n404\n00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,450\nWhen you get a laptop, they used to\nhave like a VGA port right on the side.\n\n405\n00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,680\nBut, what if you wanna DVI,\nor what if you wanted HDMI?\n\n406\n00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080\nOr they might include HDMI and\n\n407\n00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,970\nthen you get to the hotel to do your\npresentation and they've only got VGA.\n\n408\n00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,870\nSo how can we have\na consistent selection of\n\n409\n00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,050\nvideo ports on a laptop that\ndoesn't normally need them.\n\n410\n00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,220\nAnd so\nthey created this display port standard.\n\n411\n00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,750\nAnd it is a standard,\nit was originally developed by Intel and\n\n412\n00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,480\na few other companies, but\nit's a standard, anybody can use it.\n\n413\n00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,000\nAnd it's a generic video\nport that does digital.\n\n414\n00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,130\nIt doesn't do analog.\n\n415\n00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,800\nI have seen some that do it, but in\nthe official standard, it's digital only.\n\n416\n00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,410\nSo, it will do digital video, and you can\nconvert it to various other interfaces.\n\n417\n00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,390\nAnd sometimes, like on my laptop,\n\n418\n00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,370\nit will actually have an analog\ncontroller built into it also.\n\n419\n00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,180\nSo it's not so much the display port\nthat's doing it but a separate controller\n\n420\n00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,550\nthat's pushing the analog so\nthat you end up with a single port.\n\n421\n00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,700\nThey can handle multiple\ntypes of connections.\n\n422\n00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,650\nAnd so, you've seen me hold up these\nlittle adapters in this show, right?\n\n423\n00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,650\nSo what are these adapters?\n\n424\n00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,540\nWell, I grabbed these out of my\nlaptop bag right before the show.\n\n425\n00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,560\nI keep these in my laptop\nall the time because\n\n426\n00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,080\nI never know what I'm gonna get\nwhen I go to give a presentation.\n\n427\n00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,070\nSo these things, I tote along with me.\n\n428\n00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,100\nAnd what you'll see on one side.\n\n429\n00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,560\nLet me show you here an example.\n\n430\n00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,230\nWhat you'll see on one side is a video\nconnector like here I've got VGA,\n\n431\n00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,650\nall right?\n\n432\n00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,540\nAnd on the other side, I've got this\nlittle squat connector, all right?\n\n433\n00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,130\nIt's kind of shaped like a,\nI don't even know what that would be.\n\n434\n00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,050\nRonny?\nIt's six sided so\n\n435\n00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,120\nit would be a, sexagon or something.\n\n436\n00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,160\n>> Hexagon?\n>> Now it sounds like a bad movie.\n\n437\n00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,960\nAnyhow.\nSo it's an odd little connector and\n\n438\n00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,730\nit's designed to just be\na generic video adaptor.\n\n439\n00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:41,130\nSo you can get display port adapters that\non the other end maybe they're HDMI,\n\n440\n00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:47,080\nmaybe they're VGA, they're whatever,\nto be able to connect in and work with it.\n\n441\n00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,846\nAnd so\nit's nice that you have this single port,\n\n442\n00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,687\nthat you can then convert\ninto whatever you want.\n\n443\n00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:57,490\nNow there are some companies that make\nmonitors that actually just have this\n\n444\n00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,901\nsame display port connector on them.\n\n445\n00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:04,703\nYou might get a cable that has that\ndisplay port plug on both ends.\n\n446\n00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,631\nAnd if that's the case,\nyou can run it right out of your laptop,\n\n447\n00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:07,435\nright into that monitor.\n\n448\n00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:10,570\nBut it's pretty uncommon,\nit's not something vendors regularly do.\n\n449\n00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,600\nThey're normally going to\nhave the other connectors.\n\n450\n00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,685\nBut that display port adaptor let's us\nchoose what we want our output to be,\n\n451\n00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:18,680\nand that's pretty awesome.\n\n452\n00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,430\n>> Yeah, the versatility of this is\nprobably why you're seeing it more\n\n453\n00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,150\npopular on more systems.\n\n454\n00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,350\nSo expect to see it.\n\n455\n00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,540\n>> Now, some of the other things\nto remember about display port.\n\n456\n00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540\nWe call it display port, most vendors do.\n\n457\n00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,352\nRonnie, you've got display\nport on your laptop, right?\n\n458\n00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:35,635\n>> I do.\n>> So Ronnie's got a Dell,\n\n459\n00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:37,800\nhe's running Windows and\nit's display port.\n\n460\n00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,980\nNow, I've got a Mac, and\nI've got a display port right here, but\n\n461\n00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,570\nthat's not what Apple calls it.\n\n462\n00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,890\nApple calls it Thunderbolt.\n\n463\n00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n464\n00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,460\nApple's Thunderbolt is their\nversion of display port, but\n\n465\n00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,140\nit also gives them the ability\nto do a lot of other things.\n\n466\n00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,910\nAnd so, like right now, Don's computer\nis hooked up, but his display port or\n\n467\n00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,030\nThunderbolt is actually hooked\ninto the network adaptor for\n\n468\n00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,190\nhim to be able to do that.\n\n469\n00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,420\nSo it's not just about video.\n\n470\n00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,460\n>> Apple worked with Intel, and\nthey created this modification\n\n471\n00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,720\nof display port that can do more than what\nyour typical display port can do, and\n\n472\n00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,930\nso it does video as well as data, too.\n\n473\n00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,750\nAnd that's why there's\ntwo different names here.\n\n474\n00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,895\nThe port looks identical, and\nwhen I buy an adapter like this one,\n\n475\n00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:23,050\nit's display port on one end and\nVGA on the other.\n\n476\n00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,360\nI can use this on Ronnie's Dell,\nor I can use it on my Mac.\n\n477\n00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,450\nIt works fine.\n\n478\n00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,550\nEven though his is displayed port and\nmine is Thunderbolt, they work the same.\n\n479\n00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,290\nBut I also have a little hard drive back\nhere that has Thunderbolt on it, and\n\n480\n00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,080\nI can plug in with that on my Mac.\n\n481\n00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240\nBut if I plug that into his Dell,\nit won't work, and\n\n482\n00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,620\nthat's because Apple has modified that.\n\n483\n00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,680\nAnd if another vendor wants to support it,\nthey'll have to license.\n\n484\n00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,610\nYou actually have to\nlicense it from Intel.\n\n485\n00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,390\nIntel's the ones who are kind\nof holding onto that one.\n\n486\n00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,700\nWith technologies like that, you don't\nknow how long they're gonna be around.\n\n487\n00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,010\nApple especially will back all sorts of\nweird connectors, and they come and go.\n\n488\n00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,390\nSo right now, Thunderbolt is\nextremely common on Apple devices.\n\n489\n00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,690\nFive years from now, it might be gone and\nreplaced with something else,\n\n490\n00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,250\nbut it is out there.\n\n491\n00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,550\nSo that's why this one\nhas two different names.\n\n492\n00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,630\nThe ports look identical,\nthere's not much of a difference.\n\n493\n00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,370\nIf it's a Thunderbolt port, it'll normally\nhave a little lightning bolt on it.\n\n494\n00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,930\nBut other than that,\nit's just display port.\n\n495\n00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,530\nNow Ronnie, there is a variation of\ndisplay port that we'll see, too.\n\n496\n00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,740\nWhat we've been showing you,\n\n497\n00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,890\nthese are all the standard display port\nthat you're normally going to deal with.\n\n498\n00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,540\n>> The mini ones.\n>> So, let's go back so we see that.\n\n499\n00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,670\nAnd we call them mini ones, right?\n\n500\n00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,360\nSo it's kind of like a mini connector, but\nit's actually just the standard connector.\n\n501\n00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360\nIt's not really miniature.\n\n502\n00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,050\nThere is a full size one.\n\n503\n00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,270\nThe original display port devices when\nthe standard was originally created,\n\n504\n00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,360\nwere much, much larger, and\nwe've got one of those sitting right here.\n\n505\n00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,210\nLet's see.\n\n506\n00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:56,520\nSo, like here you take this cable,\nI'm converting display port into VGA.\n\n507\n00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,180\nHere's one that's converting\nthe larger display port format to DVI.\n\n508\n00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,590\nThese cables really do basically\nthe same thing, like I said,\n\n509\n00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,090\njust different connectors here.\n\n510\n00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,260\nBut the display port on\nthe other end is different.\n\n511\n00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,690\nAnd this port, this gigantic one,\nwas designed for desktops and video cards.\n\n512\n00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,674\nSo when you have a desktop video card,\nyou may see that port, and\n\n513\n00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,810\nyou may need a special kind of adapter.\n\n514\n00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,710\nBut most systems have moved\nto this smaller connector.\n\n515\n00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,240\nIt works just as well, does the same\nthing, but in a smaller form factor,\n\n516\n00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,310\nwhich makes it a lot more practical.\n\n517\n00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,350\nAll right.\n\n518\n00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,170\nSo that is display port and Thunderbolt.\n\n519\n00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,280\nAnd I think we're kind of\nwinding down on our connectors.\n\n520\n00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,900\nWe have just a couple\nmore to talk about here.\n\n521\n00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,220\nThe next one in our list is USB.\n\n522\n00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,410\nNow, USB is Universal Serial Bus, and\n\n523\n00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,705\nit's a lot different than the other\nconnectors, isn't it, Ronnie?\n\n524\n00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,490\n>> Yeah, with our Universal Serial Bus,\n\n525\n00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,100\nmost of us just think about this as\nbeing able to connect peripheral devices\n\n526\n00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,950\nlike printers and scanners and\ndifferent devices like that.\n\n527\n00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,470\nAnd when I first heard somebody saying,\noh no, you can run a video or\n\n528\n00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:08,090\na display adapter off of USB, I think\nthat was the first time I was like,\n\n529\n00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,290\nno, that can't really be possible.\n\n530\n00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,821\nBut it is, so USB is one of the standards\nthat we do have, or one of the cables that\n\n531\n00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:19,100\nwe have, and which we can shoot our\nvideo or our display off on that screen.\n\n532\n00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,770\nAnd I'm using this right now in\na docking station that I have, and\n\n533\n00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,130\nI plug in a USB cable into\nthat docking station, and\n\n534\n00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,500\nit actually makes my monitor display\nonto two monitors on my desktop.\n\n535\n00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,340\nSo it's really something that\n\n536\n00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,960\nI have not experienced before\nuntil probably this past year.\n\n537\n00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,390\n>> Yeah, let me show you an example.\n\n538\n00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,860\nI don't have one here on\nthe set to show me, but\n\n539\n00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,010\nI'm going to pull up Amazon's website\nhere and show you some of the ones.\n\n540\n00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,440\nI actually have one of these that I bought\nfor here at the studio and we don't use,\n\n541\n00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,910\nand I have it on my desk at home now.\n\n542\n00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,680\nIt's a USB monitor.\n\n543\n00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,280\nSo this is a seven-inch monitor\nthat has USB ports on it,\n\n544\n00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,480\nand you plug it into the computer via USB,\nand that's it.\n\n545\n00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,860\nSo it just runs right in there, and\n\n546\n00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,270\nit shows up as another\nmonitor on your system.\n\n547\n00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,390\nNow, USB.\n\n548\n00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,760\nWell hang on, let me do one\nmore thing before I show that.\n\n549\n00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,710\nSo, that's an example of a monitor that\njust straight up uses USB to connect\n\n550\n00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,940\nto your computer and that's it.\n\n551\n00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,830\nYou can also get adapters like this one,\nall right?\n\n552\n00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,150\nAnd this is what you\nhave at your dash right?\n\n553\n00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,250\nI think you have this exact one.\n\n554\n00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,800\n>> I do.\n\n555\n00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,620\n>> Okay.\n\n556\n00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,250\nSo here it's DVI on this side.\n\n557\n00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,440\nBut on the other side, which I guess\nthey're not really showing here,\n\n558\n00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,720\nwell I guess this one barely shows it.\n\n559\n00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,830\nYou can see here where it's\na DVI cable up here, and\n\n560\n00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,470\non the other end, that's a USB cable.\n\n561\n00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,560\nI can see the USB symbol there,\nthe little forking data connector.\n\n562\n00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,210\nSo this plugged in, and it shows up as\nanother video card on your computer.\n\n563\n00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,190\nSo if you have a single monitor on your\ncomputer, and you wanna add a second\n\n564\n00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,080\nmonitor, you can just slap one of\nthese onto a USB port and off you go.\n\n565\n00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,240\nSo a great way to add video.\n\n566\n00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,180\nBut much like Thunderbolt,\nUSB is not limited to video.\n\n567\n00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,490\nIn fact,\nvideo was added far later with it.\n\n568\n00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,940\nUSB was originally designed for data.\n\n569\n00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,040\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n570\n00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,710\nMice, keyboards, sound cards,\njust a ton of devices.\n\n571\n00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,330\nThings that you can plug in.\n\n572\n00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,500\nScanners, printers, you name it,\nyou can plug it in via USB these days.\n\n573\n00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,410\nSo video is just one of the facets, and so\n\n574\n00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,310\nyou'll notice in CompTIA's\nobjectives they list USB twice.\n\n575\n00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:28,220\nIt's listed once up here for video, and\nthen once down here again separately.\n\n576\n00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,610\nSo we're gonna talk more about USB later,\nbut\n\n577\n00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,230\njust be aware that you\ncan get USB displays.\n\n578\n00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,600\nOne thing to remember is on a USB display,\nthe refresh rate is always slower.\n\n579\n00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,310\nNow what is a refresh rate?\n\n580\n00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,430\nWhen your computer is drawing that image\non the monitor, it has to draw it over and\n\n581\n00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,050\nover and over again.\n\n582\n00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,900\nAnd when you have motion\ngoing across the screen,\n\n583\n00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,680\nthe human eye can perceive\nthat redraw if it's too slow.\n\n584\n00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,537\nSo most systems run at about 60 hertz,\n\n585\n00:30:57,537 --> 00:31:01,820\nabout 60 images per second, and\nthe human eye can't pick up that much.\n\n586\n00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,090\nSo when you're moving your mouse,\nit looks like it's going nice and\n\n587\n00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,480\nsmooth across the screen, when in\nreality you just saw 60 pictures and\n\n588\n00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,380\neach one had the mouse in\na slighty different spot.\n\n589\n00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,820\nYou don't notice.\n\n590\n00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,270\nIf you start going lower,\n\n591\n00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,650\ndown to 30 hertz, now it becomes\nalmost perceptible to the human eye.\n\n592\n00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,940\nIt depends on the person, but\nsomewhere in between usually 24 and\n\n593\n00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,060\n28 frames per second is where a person\nwill be able to perceive that difference.\n\n594\n00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,390\nAnd so the slower it gets, the more\nlikely you'll notice that stutter, and\n\n595\n00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,830\nUSB monitors always have\na slower refresh rate than\n\n596\n00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,590\nany of the other connectors\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n597\n00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,840\nSo, if you're gonna be watching movies,\n\n598\n00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,980\nplaying video games,\na USB monitor is not the greatest.\n\n599\n00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,920\nBut if you're working in a spreadsheet,\nif you're typing emails,\n\n600\n00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,290\nbrowsing the web,\nthat USB monitor works great.\n\n601\n00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,420\nSo it's a great secondary monitor,\nmaybe not a great primary.\n\n602\n00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,470\nAll right, we've got two other ones.\n\n603\n00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,351\nI know we're short on time in this\nsegment, but let's go ahead and\n\n604\n00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,489\nknock these last two out.\n\n605\n00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,289\nSo S-Video.\n\n606\n00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,396\nNow S-Video,\nCompTIA calls it out in the objectives,\n\n607\n00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:09,108\nand It's such an old cable that\nwe really just don't see anymore.\n\n608\n00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:12,060\nWe could not find one for the show.\n\n609\n00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,420\nSo let me just pull a picture up here\non our trusty friend the Internet.\n\n610\n00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,679\nSo we'll do a Google image search for\nan S video cable.\n\n611\n00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:26,068\nWay back in the day with televisions,\npeople started moving to these\n\n612\n00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:29,730\ns-video cables because they gave\na higher quality of video for\n\n613\n00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,930\nback in the standard definition days,\nall right.\n\n614\n00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,290\nThe last time I touched one of these\ncables was easily ten years ago.\n\n615\n00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,490\nI'm sure there's still some\nthat are out there, but\n\n616\n00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,400\nit worked off a very simple premise that\nyou just had these four little pins, and\n\n617\n00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,280\nthey would push the various colors out\nto the screen to get it displayed.\n\n618\n00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,900\nAnd it would do it in a sharper\nway than the old way,\n\n619\n00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,780\nwhich was to send all of\nyour colors across one line.\n\n620\n00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,630\nYou used to have the old RF cables,\nthat you would screw on to the back of\n\n621\n00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:00,420\nthe t.v., and the entire signal was sent\nacross that one copper wire in that cable.\n\n622\n00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,030\nHere it splits them out which allows\nit to be sharper and crisper, right?\n\n623\n00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,750\nSo it was an improvement for that, right?.\n\n624\n00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,520\nThis is easily the worst of all\nthe connectors that we've seen here,\n\n625\n00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,970\nso back when this came out\nit was an improvement.\n\n626\n00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,250\nNow it's terrible,\nyou don't want to have this.\n\n627\n00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,350\n>> I think I find it hard pressed to find\nany device that I know of, except for\n\n628\n00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,110\nmaybe a really old TV today, to have it.\n\n629\n00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,920\nI don't even remember if there\nwas a monitor display that just.\n\n630\n00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,860\nDid you ever have one?\n\n631\n00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,770\n>> I never had a computer monitor.\n\n632\n00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,970\nIt was always TVs, you know.\n\n633\n00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,810\nYou hook a Nintendo up, and\nI mean the original Nintendo, and\n\n634\n00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,801\nyou'd go in S-Video if you could.\n\n635\n00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:39,920\nSo the main reason CompTIA\nhas it on the objectives\n\n636\n00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,060\nis because we're going to see a little\nbit later it's really easy to mix this\n\n637\n00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,340\ncable up with another cable we're going to\nsee later called a PS/2 cable, all right.\n\n638\n00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,760\nSo that's really the reason it's here,\n\n639\n00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,290\nnot because they expect\nyou to see it with video.\n\n640\n00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,490\nBut that is just called S-Video and\nit stands for\n\n641\n00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,390\nseparate video because it's doing separate\nvideo signals across those things.\n\n642\n00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,090\n>> In that same vein,\nour last cable that we talked about for\n\n643\n00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,960\nvideo is what we call the component RGB.\n\n644\n00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,550\nRGB stands for red, green and\nblue, and in the same way that\n\n645\n00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,350\nS video separated those signals out before\nsending it across the wire, these red,\n\n646\n00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,230\ngreen, and blue cables or\nthese component cables do the same thing.\n\n647\n00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,440\nSo this is a higher quality\nthan the s video, and\n\n648\n00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,540\nthis actually means that the output also\ncomes out in three separate outputs too,\n\n649\n00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,850\nand then goes into three separate\ninputs on the other end device.\n\n650\n00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,160\nAnd we have an example of that here.\n\n651\n00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,950\n>> So, we've got one of those cables\nhere and you can see it's got the red,\n\n652\n00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,340\nthe green and the blue.\n\n653\n00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,380\nThe kind of feeds that are coming out of\nit, these jacks are called RCA jacks,\n\n654\n00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,440\nthey were designed by\nthe RCA corporation but\n\n655\n00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,080\nthey're pretty much something\nthat anybody can use.\n\n656\n00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,520\nYou'll just see that they are colored,\nyou know red, green, blue,\n\n657\n00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,110\nit's pretty obvious what's going\nover each of these cables.\n\n658\n00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,390\nIt does actually send a little bit more,\none of the cables,\n\n659\n00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,340\nI can never remember which one.\n\n660\n00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,890\nI think it's the red one,\ncarries the signaling for white and black.\n\n661\n00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,930\nBut signaling with white and black is a\nlot easier than signaling with the colors,\n\n662\n00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,050\nso it's the one that actually\ncarries a little more.\n\n663\n00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,260\nSometimes, you'll see these\nlabeled a little bit different.\n\n664\n00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,400\nWhere it'll say like PC, PB, PY.\n\n665\n00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,130\n>> And the Y, yeah.\n\n666\n00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,970\n>> Just Y.\n\n667\n00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,540\nAnd it's the Y one that carries\nthe extra different signals but\n\n668\n00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,364\nthey're basically splitting it up,\nmuch like S-video did.\n\n669\n00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:23,530\nOne of the big differences with\nthis Is that component cabling\n\n670\n00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,510\ncan carry high definition content.\n\n671\n00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,230\nYou can actually do 720p and\neven 1080i on some of these for\n\n672\n00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,010\nHD televisions, versus S-Video that\ncould never do more than 480p.\n\n673\n00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,080\nIt was,very old standard,\nthese could do more.\n\n674\n00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,710\nSometimes you'll see it like this,\nwith just the three connectors.\n\n675\n00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,910\nOther times you'll see it with two more,\na second red and\n\n676\n00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,840\na white, and those will usually be your\naudio, your left and right stereo audio.\n\n677\n00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,020\nOr other times you'll see it just\nlike this, and it's video only.\n\n678\n00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,650\nSo it may have extra, it may not, and the\nreason they didn't normally couple it is\n\n679\n00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,790\nyou might also have fiber optic for your\naudio or some other connector that you\n\n680\n00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,100\nmight use to provide that connectivity,\nbut that is a component cable.\n\n681\n00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,710\nIt's another one you might see.\n\n682\n00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,980\nNot very common in computers,\nbut in entertainment systems,\n\n683\n00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,580\nthings like DVD players, and so on,\nyou'll see those cables pretty regularly.\n\n684\n00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,240\n>> So, in comparison, the HDMI may then,\nwould be considered of highest quality?\n\n685\n00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,660\n>> Of the ones that we showed, yes.\n\n686\n00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,010\n>> And then, from there, we would\nprobably go to DVI, or RGB, maybe?\n\n687\n00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,110\n>> Well,\nwe want to throw a display port in there.\n\n688\n00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,690\nAnd-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n689\n00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,300\nThe display port.\n\n690\n00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,670\n>> The display port can do all\nsorts of magic, so really HDMI and\n\n691\n00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,400\ndisplay port are kind of\nright there at the top.\n\n692\n00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,110\nThen DVI.\n\n693\n00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,300\nDVI would be next really,\nas you kind of go down the line.\n\n694\n00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,830\nBut, remember for the exam, VGA,\n\n695\n00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,420\nthat's the one that you can count\non being there most of the time.\n\n696\n00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,680\nAlmost everybody knows that.\n\n697\n00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,890\nProjectors and so on.\n\n698\n00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,660\nBut it is old, and the newer connectors\nare kind of where we're going.\n\n699\n00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200\nAll right, well Ronny, that's\na pretty good spot for us to stop and\n\n700\n00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,010\ntake a breather.\n\n701\n00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,100\nSo let's pause here,\nwe're going to take a break.\n\n702\n00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,390\nWhen we get back,\nwe're going to move out of the video and\n\n703\n00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,304\nwe're going to start taking a look\nat other connectors on the computer,\n\n704\n00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,540\nmostly centering around data and\nperipherals.\n\n705\n00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,673\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n706\n00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:13,768\n[MUSIC]\n\n707\n00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,970\n>> All right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n708\n00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,270\nSo now we're ready to move\nbeyond the world of video, so\n\n709\n00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,570\nwe're going to just step\naway from video cables and\n\n710\n00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,100\ntalk about all the other cables that\nwe're going to plug into our computer.\n\n711\n00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,480\nSo at this point,\nyou should have your monitor hooked up, so\n\n712\n00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,320\nwe're good to go there.\n\n713\n00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,730\nWhat about everything else?\n\n714\n00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,100\nWell, we have a whole virtual\ncornucopia of cable connector types,\n\n715\n00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,020\na plethora if you will,\nthen we'll jump through here.\n\n716\n00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,250\nI'm going to use all my\nfavorite words in this episode.\n\n717\n00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,392\nI got to figure out how to work\nviscosity into this one, so\n\n718\n00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:46,890\nlet's dive into our data\n[INAUDIBLE] Ronnie.\n\n719\n00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,120\n>> We can at least work into the term\nfire wire, that sounds exciting.\n\n720\n00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,875\n>> There we go.\n>> [LAUGH] So fire wire,\n\n721\n00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,695\nand it's kind of interesting that\nwe're using the term fire wire,\n\n722\n00:37:56,695 --> 00:38:02,130\nbecause this is normally where Apple\nreally kind of came up with the idea, and,\n\n723\n00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,280\nwhen they did it, they actually had this\nnice idea for a cable that could connect\n\n724\n00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,270\neverything they wanted to connect and even\nmultiple connections at the same time.\n\n725\n00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,360\nSo, fire wire is kind of one of those\nstandards that really is competing against\n\n726\n00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,690\nwhat we call USB, and\nit allows us to connect multiple devices.\n\n727\n00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,830\nWe can daisy chain them,\nwe can connect them all together, and\n\n728\n00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,350\nthey can all connect to one computer,\nand access them all at the same time.\n\n729\n00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,350\n>> And in the earlier days of computing,\nyour peripheral devices,\n\n730\n00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,490\nthey almost all had their own\nseparate independent connectors.\n\n731\n00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,410\nAnd it was really frustrating because if\nyou had a particular type of scanner or\n\n732\n00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,730\na particular type of printer,\nkeyboard, mouse, you might have\n\n733\n00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,380\nfour completely different connectors, and\nyour computer may or may not have those.\n\n734\n00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,060\nSo there was a huge market\nin people selling these\n\n735\n00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,340\nadapter cards you could pop into\nyour computer to add these cords and\n\n736\n00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,090\nit was very common,\nI remember having to buy an LPT port for\n\n737\n00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,840\na printer back in the day, because I just\ndidn't have the right port on my system.\n\n738\n00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,710\nSo that was frustrating.\n\n739\n00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,990\nAnd so people were looking for\nsolutions on that.\n\n740\n00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,870\nAnd Intel actually helped\ndevelop two different solutions,\n\n741\n00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,320\none in partnership with Apple,\nwhich was FireWire.\n\n742\n00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,108\nAnd one that was designed to be\nan open standard, which became USB,\n\n743\n00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:13,905\nthe Universal Serial Box, and\nthey both kind of did the same thing.\n\n744\n00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:19,218\nThey allowed you to connect many different\ntype of devices all using the same\n\n745\n00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:25,320\ntype of cable, and actually all using\nthe same exact connector, sharing a port.\n\n746\n00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,970\nSo if I had five devices,\nI didn't need five ports anymore.\n\n747\n00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,410\nI could have one port that ran\nto a little splitter, a hub,\n\n748\n00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,520\nand then I could plug\nall the devices in that.\n\n749\n00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,415\nSo you could have tons of\ndevices that were all connected.\n\n750\n00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:42,225\nNow, FireWire and USB,\nthey both work sort of the same way.\n\n751\n00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,875\nThere are some little\ndifferences under the hood but\n\n752\n00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:50,280\ntheir goal is to allow you to have many\ndevices all connected using a Common port.\n\n753\n00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,660\nA single cable type.\n\n754\n00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,960\nA single port type.\n\n755\n00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,500\nTo make it easier to\nmanufacture computers.\n\n756\n00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,960\nThe problem with FireWire.\n\n757\n00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,190\nWell, I shouldn't say\nit's a problem right.\n\n758\n00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,242\nIf you go to a computer today\nyou are guaranteed to find USB.\n\n759\n00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:07,003\nOut of that battle USB won, so that is the\nstandard one that you're going to find.\n\n760\n00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:11,760\nFireWire was actually faster,\nso a faster standard than USB.\n\n761\n00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,500\nBut, Apple held licensing on it,\nIntel held licensing on it,\n\n762\n00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,490\nand if you want to put a FireWire\nport on your computer,\n\n763\n00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,280\nyou've gotta pay licensing fees over\nto Apple, and so most vendors said, eh,\n\n764\n00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,410\nwe'll go with the slightly slower standard\nwhere we don't have to pay anybody.\n\n765\n00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,980\nAnd that one won out, and\nthat happens in computing quite a lot.\n\n766\n00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,128\nIt's not always the best thing that wins.\n\n767\n00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:34,482\nSometimes it's the most affordable,\nand that's kind of how this works.\n\n768\n00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,756\nAll right, so Ronnie, let's take\na look at a FireWire cable here and\n\n769\n00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,230\nwe'll see what that's like.\n\n770\n00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,175\n>> Yep.\n\n771\n00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:47,060\nSo we've got our little FireWire\ncable that we have right here and\n\n772\n00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,050\nusually the regular connector that we have\nis gonna look kind of like an arrowhead.\n\n773\n00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,980\nAnd I don't think I can\nshow that very easily.\n\n774\n00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,100\nYou'll actually see that the top end\nis actually kind of shaped in the form\n\n775\n00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,900\nof a bullet or an arrow and then it\ncomes down and squares off right here.\n\n776\n00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,670\nAnd there are pins inside,\nand very popular with Apple,\n\n777\n00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,060\nbut you don't really see it\nvery often in other devices.\n\n778\n00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,250\nRemember that Sony actually came out\nwith their own version of this, too.\n\n779\n00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,770\nYou might see the term i.LINK,\nand you'll see that.\n\n780\n00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,970\nAnd then there's a mini version,\nor micro version?\n\n781\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,570\nMini version.\n\n782\n00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,550\n>> I think they call it micro.\n\n783\n00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,555\n>> One of those, micro.\n\n784\n00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:30,330\nYeah, a micro version of it that allows\nyou to connect to different devices.\n\n785\n00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,920\nSo you'll see that a lot\ntimes in audio and\n\n786\n00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,080\nvisual equipment,\nthis is the one you'll see.\n\n787\n00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,595\n>> Yeah, now, this is another connector\nthat's very similar to HDMI where\n\n788\n00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:41,826\nwe might say there's pins in there but\nthere's not actually pins,\n\n789\n00:41:41,826 --> 00:41:45,630\nthere's copper pads, actually called\ncopper traces that are in there.\n\n790\n00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,790\nSo when you plug it in, the pressure on\nthis cable is what's gonna push those\n\n791\n00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,670\nlittle copper pads against the copper\npad in the connector on the other side.\n\n792\n00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,620\nNow your computer may or\nmay not have FireWire.\n\n793\n00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,080\nIf you have an Apple product that was\nmanufactured probably four years or\n\n794\n00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,600\nolder, then you're more than likely\ngoing to have a FireWire connector.\n\n795\n00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,430\nOn newer Apples, so ones like mine here,\nI don't have FireWire anymore, and\n\n796\n00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,550\nthe reason is they've\nmoved over to Thunderbolt.\n\n797\n00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,680\nThat's kind of replaced FireWire, so\nwe're starting to see the end of it.\n\n798\n00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,590\nThere is actually a new FireWire\nstandard that's coming out soon that's\n\n799\n00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,620\ngot some really impressive speeds, but\nFireWire is definitely a dying connector.\n\n800\n00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,870\nIf your computer doesn't have FireWire,\nit doesn't mean you can't use it.\n\n801\n00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,950\nYou can buy cards.\n\n802\n00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,961\nI've got one right here behind me, like,\n[SOUND] rip this out of this computer.\n\n803\n00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,140\nThat was very graceful.\n\n804\n00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,235\nSo I've got a card right here, and if my\ncomputer doesn't have FireWire ports,\n\n805\n00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:39,925\nI could add one, and\nthis one actually adds two.\n\n806\n00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,505\nSo if you get a video camera and\n\n807\n00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:46,005\nyou wanna push video onto your computer\nat a high data rate and it only supports\n\n808\n00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:50,565\nFireWire, you grab this guy, we take our\nFireWire cable, chuck it right in there.\n\n809\n00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:53,495\nAnd now we've got FireWire into our PC,\nright?\n\n810\n00:42:53,495 --> 00:42:55,585\nSo it's not a Mac-only thing.\n\n811\n00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:57,330\nSome people are like, oh,\nthat's an Apple thing.\n\n812\n00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,170\nAnybody can do FireWire,\nthey just have to pay the licensing and\n\n813\n00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,110\nSony was all about it.\n\n814\n00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,340\nThey really do a lot of FireWire stuff.\n\n815\n00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,710\nApple, obviously,\nbecause they helped to created it.\n\n816\n00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,385\nBut it is out there.\n\n817\n00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,205\nIt's just kinda going away now.\n\n818\n00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:12,895\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:17,665\nWhen Don was talking about multiple\ndevices being on a connect into one port,\n\n820\n00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,715\nFireWire actually went insane, right?\n\n821\n00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:23,485\nThey said, you can connect up to\n63 devices through that one port.\n\n822\n00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,925\nIt's amazing how many devices we\ncan actually connect together using\n\n823\n00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:28,695\nthat one single port.\n\n824\n00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:33,110\n>> You know, there's another thing that\na lot of people don't know about FireWire,\n\n825\n00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,560\nwhich, normally with a cable, you have\na peripheral device like a printer or\n\n826\n00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,370\nwhatever, and you plug it into your\ncomputer and your computer sees it, right?\n\n827\n00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,960\nThey're really point to point connections,\none device connected to one computer.\n\n828\n00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,930\nWith FireWire,\n\n829\n00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,770\nyou can actually have one device that's\nconnected to more than one computer.\n\n830\n00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,360\nSo if you had a printer you wanted to\nshare between computers, you can actually\n\n831\n00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,000\ntake it, if it was a FireWire printer,\nand plug it into a FireWire hub,\n\n832\n00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,006\na little splitter, and\nrun it to two different computers and\n\n833\n00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,755\nthey both see that printer and\nboth be able to print at it.\n\n834\n00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:07,016\nFireWire is really one of\nthe only cables that can do that.\n\n835\n00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:10,137\nIt's something that not many people know,\nnot many people do, but\n\n836\n00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:11,357\nFireWire supports that.\n\n837\n00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,845\nYou can have more than one computer\nhooked up on that FireWire network.\n\n838\n00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:17,795\nIt's basically a network at that point,\nand\n\n839\n00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:21,755\nin fact a lot of computers actually see a\nFireWire connection as a network adapter,\n\n840\n00:44:21,755 --> 00:44:24,650\neven though it's really for\nperipheral devices.\n\n841\n00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,480\nOther connectors we talked\nabout don't support that.\n\n842\n00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,735\nIn fact, none of the other ones\nwe've talked about support it.\n\n843\n00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:31,090\nSo it is kind of unique to FireWire.\n\n844\n00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,980\nAll right, the next one on our list is\neSATA and it's kind of interesting.\n\n845\n00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,710\neSATA is external serial ATA.\n\n846\n00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,570\nATA is a hard drive access standard.\n\n847\n00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,820\nAnd so ATA is kind of old, and\nit was replaced by serial ATAs.\n\n848\n00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,180\nSo that's SATA.\n\n849\n00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,690\nBut SATA is for\ndevices that are inside of your computer.\n\n850\n00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,090\neSATA, or external SATA, is for SATA\ndevices that are outside of your computer.\n\n851\n00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,160\nSo when you're looking at\nthe back of a computer,\n\n852\n00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,760\nyou may well have an eSATA jack on\nthere that will let you attach devices.\n\n853\n00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,360\nNow, I say devices because there's\na number of things that it can connect,\n\n854\n00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,908\nbut 99.9% of the time we're\ntalking about hard drives.\n\n855\n00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:19,580\nSerial ATA is designed for hard drives and\noptical drives, CDs and so on.\n\n856\n00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,690\nThere are some adaptors where you\ncan hook floppy drives up, but\n\n857\n00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,400\nit's really designed for hard drives.\n\n858\n00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,990\nAnd SATA itself is an internal\ncable connector, so\n\n859\n00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,110\nyou have to open your computer to use it.\n\n860\n00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,990\nBut, if you have an eSATA jack, then you\ncan actually plug in external hard drives\n\n861\n00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,900\nor external storage arrays and\nadd more storage to your system.\n\n862\n00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,365\nSo, Ronnie, you've got a motherboard here\nthat actually has an eSATA jack on it,\n\n863\n00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:42,180\nright?\n\n864\n00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,810\n>> Yes.\n\n865\n00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:43,330\n>> Where is it?\n\n866\n00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,052\nOh, there it is.\n\n867\n00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:49,040\nAll right, so we can see, right here we've\ngot this eSATA jack, and it's a flat,\n\n868\n00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,980\nlong connector, and you really can't see\nit cuz it's black on black, but there's\n\n869\n00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,890\nthese little notches on the two sides that\nensure the cable can only go in one way.\n\n870\n00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:04,260\nAnd when you have an eSATA device,\nyou get a cable that looks like this.\n\n871\n00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,420\nAnd it'll be labeled.\n\n872\n00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,550\nSee how this one actually says SATA?\n\n873\n00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,980\nIt says S-A-T-A on there.\n\n874\n00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,400\nI know gray writing on a gray\ncable is near impossible to see,\n\n875\n00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,580\nbut it says SATA on it.\n\n876\n00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,080\nAnd this is the one that's designed for\nexternal.\n\n877\n00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,120\nNow, the exam objectives don't\ncall it out, but just for\n\n878\n00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,850\ncomparison, let's take\na look at an internal one.\n\n879\n00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,900\nRight here, I've got a regular SATA cable.\n\n880\n00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,590\nAnd so\nthis is just a regular serial ATA cable.\n\n881\n00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,680\nAnd you'll notice that it is smaller.\n\n882\n00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,140\nLet me see if I can get this maybe\non some yellow or something here.\n\n883\n00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,220\nIt is smaller than the eSATA connector.\n\n884\n00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,200\nSo it's not as big of\na connector as the other one.\n\n885\n00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,680\nAnd it's designed for\nuse inside of the computer.\n\n886\n00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,170\nThey're two different sizes.\n\n887\n00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,820\nAnd with a SATA cable, remember that 18\ninches Ronnie was talking about earlier?\n\n888\n00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,570\nThese are pretty much limited to that.\n\n889\n00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,160\nAnything longer than 18 inches and\nthe signal starts to degrade.\n\n890\n00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,160\nSo to get true performance out of them,\nthese are fairly short.\n\n891\n00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,900\nBut an external device might\nneed to be further away.\n\n892\n00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,140\nAnd this cable that I've got\nIs actually pretty long here.\n\n893\n00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,500\nThis is a, what is that,\nlike a three-footer?\n\n894\n00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,550\nOr, at least something like that.\n\n895\n00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,300\nThis is a fairly long cable.\n\n896\n00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,640\nAs I drop my other ones.\n\n897\n00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,040\nSo they did different connectors on there,\njust to make sure you didn't use\n\n898\n00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,828\nan external one inside, or\nan internal one outside.\n\n899\n00:47:17,828 --> 00:47:18,970\nAll right.\n\n900\n00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,970\nIf we had that external device,\n\n901\n00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,120\nthough, we'd just throw it right\nthere on the jack and off we go.\n\n902\n00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,420\nNow these aren't very common\nanymore because USB and\n\n903\n00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,730\nFireWire have gotten a lot faster.\n\n904\n00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,880\nBut the main reason these were\ndeveloped is that USB and\n\n905\n00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,240\nFireWire in their original\nincarnations weren't very fast, and\n\n906\n00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,600\ninternal hard drives were\na heck of a lot faster.\n\n907\n00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,960\nAnd so if you had an external hard\ndrive that was hooked up by USB,\n\n908\n00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,980\nit was actually pretty slow.\n\n909\n00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,800\neSATA allowed you to have eternal hard\ndrive speeds on an external device.\n\n910\n00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,640\nAll right.\nBut, they weren't plug and play.\n\n911\n00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,653\nNow, what do I mean by plug and play?\n\n912\n00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:57,038\nWith your devices,\n\n913\n00:47:57,038 --> 00:48:01,848\nthere are some that need to be plugged\nin when you turn the computer on.\n\n914\n00:48:01,848 --> 00:48:04,471\nFor example, a keyboard.\n\n915\n00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:07,059\nYou need to have a keyboard\nplugged into your system when you\n\n916\n00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,400\nturn your computer on.\n\n917\n00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,990\nIf you turn your computer on without a\nkeyboard it's going to give you an error,\n\n918\n00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,220\nright, and say no keyboard detected.\n\n919\n00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,670\nThat's a problem.\n\n920\n00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,930\nWell, with a hard drive, your computer\nexpects the hard drive to be their\n\n921\n00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:22,460\nwhen it turns on and stay there the entire\ntime, and that's how Esatta is.\n\n922\n00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,520\nSo you hook the hard drive up, and it sees\nthe drive, and it knows it's there and\n\n923\n00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,070\nthen when you shut the computer down,\nyou can take it out.\n\n924\n00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,340\nOther technologies like USB and\nFireWire, you can add devices and\n\n925\n00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,520\nremove them whenever you want.\n\n926\n00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,730\nThe computer can be on already, you\nplug it in and use it, you unplug it and\n\n927\n00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,790\noff you go.\n\n928\n00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,360\nThat's called plug and play.\n\n929\n00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,040\nYou plug it in, you use it,\nunplug it, and go.\n\n930\n00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,050\neSATA was not like that.\n\n931\n00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,860\nNow, there are some computers that have\nadded protection for that that can do it,\n\n932\n00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,340\nbut the original design was that these\nwould just always be present, so\n\n933\n00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,500\nit wasn't usually for portable devices.\n\n934\n00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,460\n>> One of the surprising things that I\nlearned about eSATA was when I had my last\n\n935\n00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,800\nlaptop that could do what Dave is\nactually mentioning in our chatroom.\n\n936\n00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,460\nHe says that the E sata\nconnections is also designed so\n\n937\n00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,720\nthat you could plug a USB\ndevice into the port as well.\n\n938\n00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,490\nAnd, so the first time that I got my old\nlaptop, it had one E sata port on it,\n\n939\n00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,430\nand it had, I think three or four,\nactually it's three USB ports.\n\n940\n00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,180\nI said that you could use\nthe E sata port as a USB plug.\n\n941\n00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,780\nAnd so I was able to just simply plug in,\n\n942\n00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,960\nuse it as a fourth USB\nport if I needed to.\n\n943\n00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,900\nVery neat.\n\n944\n00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,660\n>> Now, be careful of that\nbecause it is not always true.\n\n945\n00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,370\nThe official E sata port does\nnot support a USB connector.\n\n946\n00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:36,350\nAnd in fact, on this motherboard, Ronnie,\nthat is an official eSATA port, and so\n\n947\n00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,600\nwhen we look at that, that port is\na little bit different than USB, and\n\n948\n00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,330\nit's actually a little bit flatter and\nit won't connect.\n\n949\n00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,540\nBut the one that you find in most laptops,\n\n950\n00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,010\nthey did a revision to the port,\nand it does.\n\n951\n00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,322\nYou plug it right in just fine.\n\n952\n00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:52,750\nIn fact, I used to have\nthe same laptop as you, Ronnie.\n\n953\n00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,640\nAnd it has one of those ports.\n\n954\n00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,150\nAnd I always plugged USB stuff.\n\n955\n00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,630\nI don't think I ever plugged an eSATA port\ninto it at all, but it had that support.\n\n956\n00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,640\nAnd my old Lenovo laptop was the same way,\nI had that and I just never did it.\n\n957\n00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,740\nBut if you have an older board like this\none, that was in the early days of eSATA,\n\n958\n00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,410\nthen it might not support\nthat USB connector.\n\n959\n00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,800\nBut I absolutely agree.\n\n960\n00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,190\nAnything purchased in the last, probably\nthe last four years, cuz this board's\n\n961\n00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:19,300\nprobably five years old, so anything in\nthe last four years is gonna support both.\n\n962\n00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,980\nYou throw USB in there, and off you go.\n\n963\n00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,970\nAll right the big thing to remember\nthere is eSATA is external.\n\n964\n00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,810\nThis is not something that's\ninside of your computer and\n\n965\n00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,600\nit's just designed to be able to have\na little bit longer cable length but\n\n966\n00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,130\nstill get you that internal drive speed.\n\n967\n00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,030\nSo pretty cool stuff there.\n\n968\n00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,860\nAll right the next one on\nour list is thunderbolt.\n\n969\n00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,810\nNow thunderbolt we talked about\nearlier is just like the display port.\n\n970\n00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,730\nThe connector looks the same but\n\n971\n00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,280\nit's designed to allow you\nto have ther things, right?\n\n972\n00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,400\nOther things than the monitors, you can\nhave various data connectors and so on.\n\n973\n00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,290\nSo let me show you,\na couple things that I use and these are,\n\n974\n00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:59,150\nthese are things that I actually use\non my computer on any given day.\n\n975\n00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,470\nI've got my laptop here, which is a Mac,\nand it does not have a network jack on it.\n\n976\n00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,920\nThere's no physical network jack.\n\n977\n00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,300\nI've got wireless, but\nwhen I'm doing a show like this and\n\n978\n00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,460\nI want to stream my video,\nI don't wanna use the wireless.\n\n979\n00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,170\nIt can be a little sluggish sometimes.\n\n980\n00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,790\nI want my screen to be nice and crisp, so\nI want a wired network jack on my laptop\n\n981\n00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:24,290\nand so I use a Thunderbolt\nto RJ-45 network connector,\n\n982\n00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,000\nto add that physical adapter to my laptop.\n\n983\n00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,920\nSo with Thunderbolt, you can do that.\n\n984\n00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,700\nYes, it's a display-port connector, right?\n\n985\n00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,110\nIt's the same as the ones we\nsaw earlier in the show but\n\n986\n00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,240\nit's got that little lightning on it,\nwhich lets me know that it doesn't work\n\n987\n00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,110\nin a regular display port,\nit'll just work in Thunderbolt ports.\n\n988\n00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,150\nAnd on my laptop I've got two of those\nports that are labeled that way.\n\n989\n00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,550\nI can use them for monitors or\nI can use them for stuff like this.\n\n990\n00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,590\nSo that's one use.\n\n991\n00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,610\nThe other thing I do is I use a lot of\nvirtual machines and I only have so\n\n992\n00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:59,630\nmuch storage in my laptop so I have this\nexternal hard drive that I tote around.\n\n993\n00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,230\nIf you look on the back of it,\nI've got a thunderbolt port.\n\n994\n00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,510\nIt's got a little lightning bolt right\nbeside it, you can barely see it.\n\n995\n00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,610\nAnd I take a thunderbolt cable.\n\n996\n00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,400\nHere's a cable it's\nThunderbolt on both sides, so\n\n997\n00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,710\nit looks like DisplayPort to DisplayPort.\n\n998\n00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,000\nAnd you can use it that way, I could\nrun DisplayPort to DisplayPort with it.\n\n999\n00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,570\nBut I use it to run from my\nlaptop to this hard drive.\n\n1000\n00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,640\nAnd I can take that and plug it in, and\n\n1001\n00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,350\nthen I'll have a whole\nhard drive available.\n\n1002\n00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:33,740\nAnd so I've got 512 gigs of storage in\nmy laptop but I've got a terabyte here,\n\n1003\n00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,670\nso I can triple the size of my\nstorage when I connect this drive.\n\n1004\n00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,210\nAnd Thunderbolt is very fast, so\n\n1005\n00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,560\nthat works really really well, and\nthat's where I store my virtual machine.\n\n1006\n00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,550\nSo in some of the shows you'll actually\nsee this drive sitting beside my laptop,\n\n1007\n00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,410\nand that's what it is.\n\n1008\n00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,480\nNow the nice thing about Thunderbolt\nis you can also daisy chain.\n\n1009\n00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,470\nAnd so you'll see other devices where\nthey might have two ports on them,\n\n1010\n00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,890\none in and one out.\n\n1011\n00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,640\nSo, I could actually have a chain\nof hard drives stuck on the end or\n\n1012\n00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,480\na chain of monitors stuck on the end and\nthey'll all work off of that single port.\n\n1013\n00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,880\nIt's very fast and very flexible.\n\n1014\n00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,740\nIt's a neat technology.\n\n1015\n00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,440\nAll right.\n\n1016\n00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,670\nBut a couple of caveats about Thunderbolt.\n\n1017\n00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,440\nIt is an Apple only thing right now.\n\n1018\n00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,330\nNobody else has adopted it because\nother technologies can make up for\n\n1019\n00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,940\nwhat this does without\nhaving to pay a license fee.\n\n1020\n00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,430\nThe other thing about Thunderbolt,\non Mac Os, on Apple, it's plug-n-n-play.\n\n1021\n00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,430\nI can add this hard drive and\nmove this hard drive whenever I want.\n\n1022\n00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,580\nBut on Windows, it is not plug-n-play.\n\n1023\n00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,770\nFor thunderbolt on a Windows machine,\n\n1024\n00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,650\nthe device has to be plugged\nin when you boot up.\n\n1025\n00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,340\nAll right.\n\n1026\n00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,760\nIf you boot up, it'll see the device.\n\n1027\n00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,810\nAnd then, if you shut down,\nthen you can remove the device.\n\n1028\n00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,570\nBut it expects it to be\nhere because on Windows,\n\n1029\n00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,290\nit'll see these devices as internal,\neven though they're external, alright.\n\n1030\n00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,940\nIf you add the device after you boot it,\nit won't see it.\n\n1031\n00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,450\nAnd, that's not Apple's fault, it's Intel.\n\n1032\n00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,350\nIntel hasn't written a full driver for\nWindows yet.\n\n1033\n00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,440\nSo, even though it's\nsupported by other platforms,\n\n1034\n00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,520\nthe full driver support\nhasn't been developed yet.\n\n1035\n00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,570\nAnd that's another reason why you don't\nsee Thunderbolt on PCs very often.\n\n1036\n00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,970\nSo.\nAll right,\n\n1037\n00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,550\nso that's probably about it for\nThunderbolt.\n\n1038\n00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,910\n>> By far the most popular type\nof cable that you probably see on\n\n1039\n00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,520\njust about anything is\ngonna be a USB cable.\n\n1040\n00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,800\nAnd so that is our next\ncable type that we want to\n\n1041\n00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,150\nmake sure that we actually\nare able to see and know.\n\n1042\n00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,787\nThe USB cable types range\nfrom the older USB B 1.1\n\n1043\n00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:33,280\nto USB 2.0, and the latest one right now,\nI shouldn't say the latest.\n\n1044\n00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,000\nThe next to latest one is USB 3.0.\n\n1045\n00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,070\nThere's even a new standard now.\n\n1046\n00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,110\nAnd the easiest way to\ndifferentiate between the two\n\n1047\n00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,960\na lot of times is that internally,\nyou'll see that they've color coded them.\n\n1048\n00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,260\nOne is blue, and\none is usually white on the inside.\n\n1049\n00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,790\nNow, that doesn't always mean\nit's gonna be like that.\n\n1050\n00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,840\nI have a little USB flash drive that\nI ended up buying one time, and\n\n1051\n00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,340\nit had blue internally,\nand it wasn't USB 3.0.\n\n1052\n00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:04,440\nThis is a much faster standard on\nUSB 3.0 than it is on USB 2.0.\n\n1053\n00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,190\nMost devices that you'll see will\nsupport at least USB 2.0 today.\n\n1054\n00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,050\nEven operates it'll tell you if you try to\nplug in, like a device that's really slow.\n\n1055\n00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,140\nIt'll tell you hey you may want to\nuse at least USB 2.0 to plug in.\n\n1056\n00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,330\nNow, a couple of different\nconnectors on the end too.\n\n1057\n00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:26,720\nThis older USB 2.0 connector\nhas an upstream connector,\n\n1058\n00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,830\none that connects to the PC.\n\n1059\n00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,690\nAnd then the other one normally\nconnects to that downstream device,\n\n1060\n00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,320\nlike a printer or a scanner.\n\n1061\n00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,340\nSo you might see two different connector\nends there to be able to plug into.\n\n1062\n00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,500\n>> And it all comes from the early days.\n\n1063\n00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,220\nIn the early days of USB,\nthey were creating a universal serial bus,\n\n1064\n00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,870\na cable that could be used for\ndarn near anything.\n\n1065\n00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,410\nPrinters, scanners, whatever.\n\n1066\n00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,710\nTo be able to connect to your system.\n\n1067\n00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,883\nWe don't wanna have that mix and\nmatch level of cables.\n\n1068\n00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:56,268\nSo they focused on\ncompatibility in the beginning.\n\n1069\n00:55:56,268 --> 00:56:00,608\nAnd in the early days, like USB 1.0, They\nhad that cable that Ronnie just showed.\n\n1070\n00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,782\nThe one that has the little house\nlooking connector on one side and\n\n1071\n00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:05,390\nthe flat one on the other.\n\n1072\n00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,720\nAnd you had to remember that the flat\nconnector went to the PC and\n\n1073\n00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,760\nthe little house connector went to\nwhatever device you were connecting.\n\n1074\n00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,110\nSo they were designed\nto go in a certain way.\n\n1075\n00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,910\nWell, after they got standard\nacceptance out there,\n\n1076\n00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:26,580\nthey focused on other things, which was\nmaking it easier and making it faster.\n\n1077\n00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,800\nSo USB 2.0 came out, and\nUSB 2.0 was over twice as fast.\n\n1078\n00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,420\nI think it was actually four times\nas fast as USB 1, right Ronny?\n\n1079\n00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,100\n>> It was a lot faster.\n\n1080\n00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,080\nSo, like USB 1 was like 10 or 12 megabits,\n\n1081\n00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,970\nand then USB 2.0 went to 480 megabits,\nso much faster.\n\n1082\n00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:46,610\n>> Much faster, and they also said it was\nkinda silly going with the two different\n\n1083\n00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,375\nconnectors, so\nlet's just drop down to one.\n\n1084\n00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:53,105\nAnd starting with USB 2.0,\nyou saw where most devices\n\n1085\n00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:57,453\njust had that flat connector and\nthe house looking one kind of went away.\n\n1086\n00:56:57,453 --> 00:57:00,235\nIt's really rarely you see that\none anymore, but if you do see it,\n\n1087\n00:57:00,235 --> 00:57:03,835\nthat's the one that plug into the device,\nnot the PC, all right?\n\n1088\n00:57:03,835 --> 00:57:06,640\nNow, with USB 2.0, things were faster but\n\n1089\n00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,750\nthey were still slower than\nwhat's in the computer.\n\n1090\n00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,271\nAnd so, they've advanced and moved on and\nnow you have USB 3.0, and 3.1,\n\n1091\n00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:16,120\nwhich just came out not\ntoo terribly long ago.\n\n1092\n00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,160\nAnd these have made it even more fast and\nwe actually have,\n\n1093\n00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,440\nin one of our other shows we\ndid a demonstration of that.\n\n1094\n00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,840\nLike copying a file on USB\n2.0 that took 45 minutes and\n\n1095\n00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,440\ndoing the same thing on USB 3.0.\n\n1096\n00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,120\nAnd it took two minutes or something, so\nit's significantly faster and with USB 3.0\n\n1097\n00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,320\nthere is some confusion because there's\na lot of different connectors to it.\n\n1098\n00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,930\nThey've always made the ports\nbackwards compatible.\n\n1099\n00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:43,360\nSo typically on your PC you're gonna\nsee a connector like this which\n\n1100\n00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,013\ncould be USB 1.1, 2.0, 3.0.\n\n1101\n00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:49,796\nSo, how do we differentiate and\nwith USB 1, there was no differentiator,\n\n1102\n00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:51,330\nit was just the port.\n\n1103\n00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:55,761\nWith USB 2, they started writing SS\non the cables and that stood for\n\n1104\n00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:57,251\nsuper speed, right?\n\n1105\n00:57:57,251 --> 00:58:00,156\nAnd so, you'll see that SS every now and\nthen on a 2.0.\n\n1106\n00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:06,040\nWith 3.0, they run out of stupid names,\nso they just decided to color it blue.\n\n1107\n00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,760\nAnd so, when you see blue like that,\nit's a USB 3 cable.\n\n1108\n00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,800\nThe cable is actually different,\ninside of it there's more wires,\n\n1109\n00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,270\nbecause USB 3 moves more speed.\n\n1110\n00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,720\nAnd in the early days,\nyou would see a connector like this one,\n\n1111\n00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,360\nwhich is a bizarre connector\nthat basically takes the old\n\n1112\n00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,940\nhouse style connector and adds\nadditional connections to it, all right?\n\n1113\n00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,090\nThat was one type of connector you saw,\n\n1114\n00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,550\nyou also saw ones where it was\njust a double flat, right?\n\n1115\n00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,740\nA flat on both sides and\nthat's pretty common.\n\n1116\n00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,140\nAnd then you see other ones\nlike mine here from my drive,\n\n1117\n00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,180\nyou might have noticed that\nmy drive had thunderbolt.\n\n1118\n00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:43,120\nAnd it also had this crazy connector over\nhere, well, what is that crazy connector?\n\n1119\n00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:50,040\nIt is actually what's considered micro\nUSB, this one side right here is micro USB\n\n1120\n00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,380\nand that's just USB 2.0 with some\nextra pins added to the side.\n\n1121\n00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:58,710\nAnd they're side by side which creates\na long strange connector that has a little\n\n1122\n00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:59,990\ngroove in the middle.\n\n1123\n00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,680\nAnd that's what's creating that separation\nyou see right in that little notch.\n\n1124\n00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,530\nSo, that's USB 3.0 and\nthose extra pins had to go somewhere and\n\n1125\n00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,320\nthat's where they are.\n\n1126\n00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,410\nNow, if you take a USB 2.0 connector and\nplug it into a 3.0 port, it'll work.\n\n1127\n00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,837\nIt'll just run at the 2.0 speeds.\n\n1128\n00:59:18,837 --> 00:59:21,879\nAnd if you plug it into a 1.0,\nor a 1.1 jack, it'll work.\n\n1129\n00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:23,740\nIt'll just go down to those speeds.\n\n1130\n00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,370\nSo with USB,\nas long as the cable fits, it'll work.\n\n1131\n00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,480\nIt'll just dumb down to the slowest\nspeed that's supported by\n\n1132\n00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,010\nall the devices in line.\n\n1133\n00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:36,140\nThe device itself, the cable, and\nthe computer that it's being plugged into.\n\n1134\n00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,480\nWhatever's the slowest, that's the speed\nthat line is gonna run at, all right?\n\n1135\n00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,510\nBut USB 3 is really awesome,\nif you're still using USB 2.0 devices for\n\n1136\n00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,400\nhard drives and video,\nyou really should move to USB 3.\n\n1137\n00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,170\nIt's way faster,\nyou'll get a much better experience.\n\n1138\n00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:56,470\nBut for keyboards and mice, they move so\nlittle data that we really don't care.\n\n1139\n00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,950\nAnd so, a lot of USB, mice, keyboards and\nso on will still be USB 1 or\n\n1140\n00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,950\neven USB 2 just because they're\nnot worried about speed.\n\n1141\n01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,740\nYou're just typing,\nyou can only type so fast.\n\n1142\n01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,040\nSo the USB devices that\nyou get may be a mix and\n\n1143\n01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,030\nyour computer will be\nperfectly happy with that.\n\n1144\n01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:16,050\nBut it will warn you if you have like a\nUSB 2 device plugged into a USB 1 port or\n\n1145\n01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,080\na 3 and a 2.\n\n1146\n01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,670\nIt'll warn you and\n\n1147\n01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,630\nsay, this device could be faster if\nyou plugged it into a faster port.\n\n1148\n01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:27,270\nJust letting you know, heads up that\nyou could go faster, all right?\n\n1149\n01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,617\n>> Yeah, a lot of times on these devices,\nespecially speed, you really don't tend to\n\n1150\n01:00:31,617 --> 01:00:35,110\nnotice the speed too much when\nyou first move to that device.\n\n1151\n01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,750\nIt's when you try and\ngo backward is when you notice the speeds.\n\n1152\n01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,040\nSo like Don,\nthe first time I got a USB 3.0 drive,\n\n1153\n01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,890\nI was like okay, it copied a file over.\n\n1154\n01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,990\nOkay, big deal.\n\n1155\n01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,700\nBut then when I tried to go back to like\nthe USB 2.0 device and copy something\n\n1156\n01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:53,020\nover, that's the same size, I thought\nI was gonna cry, it felt that slow.\n\n1157\n01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:57,020\nSo it's always that comparison, it's\nnever when you just go and see that and\n\n1158\n01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,160\nyou're like, okay, that's impressive.\n\n1159\n01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,110\nBut you still got to admit that it's\ncopying a file, but moving backward is\n\n1160\n01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,100\nwhen you start realizing that\nsomething else is very slow.\n\n1161\n01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,240\n>> Now, USB was originally\ncompeting with FireWire, right?\n\n1162\n01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,990\nAnd FireWire was actually faster than USB,\nbut\n\n1163\n01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:16,770\nUSB was basically license-free so\npeople loved to support it.\n\n1164\n01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,780\nAs we saw USB out there quite a bit, now\nwe've got Thunderbolt coming along and so\n\n1165\n01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,250\nUSB is now competing with Thunderbolt.\n\n1166\n01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:27,150\nBut even on a Mac like mine where I've\ngot these Thunderbolt ports over here,\n\n1167\n01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,770\nI've got USB ports also.\n\n1168\n01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,905\nAnd that's because Apple knows USB is\nthe most common connective available.\n\n1169\n01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:36,895\nSo it's one that only ports we've talked\nabout, it's pretty much a guarantee.\n\n1170\n01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,615\nIf you've used any computer\nbuilt in the last ten years,\n\n1171\n01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:44,205\nyou're gonna have at least one\nUSB port and normally more.\n\n1172\n01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,335\nMy computer at home on the back of it,\n\n1173\n01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,040\nI've got eight USB ports\nright across the back.\n\n1174\n01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,330\nAnd sadly it's not enough,\nI've actually added a card to add more.\n\n1175\n01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,300\nIf you look at my computer,\n\n1176\n01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,240\nit looks like a USB factory, because\nI've got keyboard and mouse are USB.\n\n1177\n01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,370\nI've got, what all do I have USB,\nI have two different joysticks are USB.\n\n1178\n01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,002\nI have an external hard drive that's USB.\n\n1179\n01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:08,190\nI've got, there's a couple other\n\n1180\n01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,700\nthings I kind of forget some of\nthe devices I have, tons of USB stuff.\n\n1181\n01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,877\n>> It's amazing especially on USB ports\ncuz you never realize that you run out of\n\n1182\n01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,199\nthem until you don't have enough of them.\n\n1183\n01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:22,367\nSo when we moved to these S XPS's,\nI can't say it.\n\n1184\n01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:26,750\nThere are only two USB ports and well\ntwo that's plenty enough for everything.\n\n1185\n01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:31,250\nBut then it wasn't long before all of\nus around here started buying the USB,\n\n1186\n01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,930\nare they hubs?\n\n1187\n01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,690\nThe 16 port hubs or the 8 port hubs, yeah.\n\n1188\n01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,830\nWhich you would actually\nbe able to plug into, and\n\n1189\n01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:42,030\nyou thought well, with 8 ports\nthat should be more than enough.\n\n1190\n01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,760\nAnd you find yourself going to eight and\nyou're like, are you joking?\n\n1191\n01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,550\nI'll have to expand to that 16 port one,\nand it just keeps going.\n\n1192\n01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,380\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n1193\n01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:53,420\n>> Now, earlier Ronnie, you mentioned that\nFireWire, you could have up to 63 devices.\n\n1194\n01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> With USB it's actually 127.\n\n1195\n01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,460\nFor every USB port on\nthe back of your computer,\n\n1196\n01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,760\nyou could branch it out with a hub.\n\n1197\n01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,790\nAnd hook up to 127 devices on that one\nport by using various hubs to split it.\n\n1198\n01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,640\nSome of the things to think about is\nthey're all sharing that connection back.\n\n1199\n01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,440\nSo you'll get that performance if you that\ncrazy unless they're keyboards and mice,\n\n1200\n01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,168\nif you have 127 keyboards.\n\n1201\n01:03:15,168 --> 01:03:20,320\nSo you can do that,\nthe other thing is both USB and\n\n1202\n01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,240\nFireWire, and Thunderbolt can\nprovide power over the connector.\n\n1203\n01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,370\nSo if I hook on my external hard drive,\nit's gotta get power from somewhere.\n\n1204\n01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,380\nIt can get it via USB or\nThunderbolt, they can draw power.\n\n1205\n01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,150\nWell, if you start splitting\nthat connector out,\n\n1206\n01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,140\nit's not gonna have enough power for\nthe devices.\n\n1207\n01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,580\nSo, when you buy those hubs to split\nthese, they usually come in two types.\n\n1208\n01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,400\nPowered and unpowered.\n\n1209\n01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,820\nAnd the unpowered ones are really cheap,\nand\n\n1210\n01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,360\nthey just plug right into the computer.\n\n1211\n01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,150\nAnd they work great,\nif you're just doing two or three devices.\n\n1212\n01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,600\nBut if you're gonna go big and do a bunch,\nyou'll need to get a powered hub.\n\n1213\n01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,541\nAnd it'll plug into your computer and\nit'll plug into a wall socket.\n\n1214\n01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:55,737\nAnd I've got one of those,\n\n1215\n01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:58,398\na little 16-port one that I\njust burned out the other day.\n\n1216\n01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:02,589\nThey don't seem to last for me, but\nit was a 16-port that had power And\n\n1217\n01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:07,280\nplugged into a USB 3 port and would split\nit out so I could have more devices on it.\n\n1218\n01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,042\nBecause I had, I remember some other ones,\nI had a Bluetooth dongle and\n\n1219\n01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:14,470\nstuff like that, and\nI've added on them to my computer.\n\n1220\n01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:20,000\n>> Yeah, I've been really impressed\nwith this little docking station I have.\n\n1221\n01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,180\nIt allows me to connect everything I\nneed to to display out to two different\n\n1222\n01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:29,690\nmonitors and I can plug a keyboard in\nto it, I can plug a mouse in to it.\n\n1223\n01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:32,600\nIt's all really coming\nback to that one USB port.\n\n1224\n01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,140\nEven on that docking station\nthere's two USB 3.0 and\n\n1225\n01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,978\nthen two additional USB 2.0\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1226\n01:04:38,978 --> 01:04:40,673\n>> Ports on there.\n\n1227\n01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:45,130\nSo they're taking advantage of that\nability to be able to spread out\n\n1228\n01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:48,540\nthat technology and to allow me to\nconnect more devices through one port.\n\n1229\n01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,870\n>> Amazing.\nSo when you walk in in the morning,\n\n1230\n01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,210\nyou just pop in that one cable, and\nyou're actually attaching like eight or\n\n1231\n01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,450\nnine different devices,\nall at the same time.\n\n1232\n01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,810\nAnd that's the same thing with FireWire\nand same thing with Thunderbolt.\n\n1233\n01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:01,090\nThat's the advantage of using\nthese types of common connectors.\n\n1234\n01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,820\nNow, it's easy to lose sight of how\nfortunate we are about these cables\n\n1235\n01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,240\nbecause they're very powerful.\n\n1236\n01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,460\nWe need to understand\nhow it was before that.\n\n1237\n01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,720\nAnd that's what the last set of cables\nthat CompTIA calls out, as they call it.\n\n1238\n01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,840\nAll the individual ones that we used to\nhave to deal with, and I guess one or\n\n1239\n01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,880\ntwo that we still do have to deal with,\nbut we're gonna go through and\n\n1240\n01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,080\ndrive into those.\n\n1241\n01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,090\nBut looking at the clock we're a little\nshort on time on this segment,\n\n1242\n01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,190\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n1243\n01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,810\n>> And when we get back, we'll delve\nthrough some of the older cable types that\n\n1244\n01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,780\nyou may still encounter out there,\nso you need to be aware of.\n\n1245\n01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,078\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1246\n01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:38,059\n[MUSIC].\n\n1247\n01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:43,298\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1248\n01:05:43,298 --> 01:05:44,720\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1249\n01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,130\nSo, in this segment, we're gonna\ntake look at a couple of cables.\n\n1250\n01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,690\nSeveral of which are still in use today,\nand are very important.\n\n1251\n01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,510\nBut we're also gonna look at\na few that are kind of a walk\n\n1252\n01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,270\ndown memory lane that you may or\nmay not see out there today.\n\n1253\n01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,990\nHopefully you don't.\n\n1254\n01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:02,430\nBut the first that CompTIA\ncalls out is PS/2.\n\n1255\n01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:06,720\nAnd the way that's written is PS and\na forward slash, and the number two.\n\n1256\n01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,620\nAnd it is actually something\nthat originated from IBM.\n\n1257\n01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:14,250\nBack in the old days, right,\nwhen we kinda walked back memory lane\n\n1258\n01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:18,050\nIBM had a series of computers\nthat were the IBM PS2's.\n\n1259\n01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,120\nAnd it stood for Personal System 2.\n\n1260\n01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,070\nAnd so that's it right there, PS2.\n\n1261\n01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:26,050\nSo, that was what their systems were\ncalled, and they created these connectors.\n\n1262\n01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,810\nAnd IBM was the king of\ncomputing back then.\n\n1263\n01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:32,670\nSo, when they did something,\nother people followed.\n\n1264\n01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,140\nAnd so the standard that they created for\nkeyboards and\n\n1265\n01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:38,060\nmice became a standard everybody followed.\n\n1266\n01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,230\nAnd so in the late 80s and\nreally throughout the 90s\n\n1267\n01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,750\nif you bought a keyboard or a mouse,\nthey were almost always PS/2.\n\n1268\n01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,740\nNow there weren't any other\ndevices that use PS/2,\n\n1269\n01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,760\nit was just for keyboards and mice.\n\n1270\n01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,420\nAnd unfortunately they use\nthe exact same connector, so\n\n1271\n01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,080\nit was really easy to mix them up.\n\n1272\n01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,780\nSo let's take a look at these and\nthen we'll kinda talk about that.\n\n1273\n01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,100\n>> To make sure that we wouldn't\nmix them up, they went ahead and\n\n1274\n01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,550\nthey color coded the devices or the actual\nconnector so that we wouldn't mix them up.\n\n1275\n01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,620\nToday, and\n\n1276\n01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,820\njust like, I don't know originally\nif it was actually this color coded.\n\n1277\n01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,320\nBut there came a point when\nthey decided to color code it.\n\n1278\n01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,560\nSo that the keyboards were always\nin this lavender or purple color.\n\n1279\n01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,710\nAnd then the mice were\nalways in this green color.\n\n1280\n01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,140\nSo that when you did connect them you\nwould know exactly which one was which.\n\n1281\n01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,090\nAnd most of the ports that you would\nconnect these to on the back of computers\n\n1282\n01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,330\nthey would actually go ahead and\ncolor code those.\n\n1283\n01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,040\nSo it would be very difficult for\nus to mix up.\n\n1284\n01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,530\nNow you can't switch them around.\n\n1285\n01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:41,440\nLike if you plug this one into the green\nport on the back of the computer,\n\n1286\n01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,800\nit doesn't function like a keyboard.\n\n1287\n01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,720\nYou plug this one into\nthe keyboard connector,\n\n1288\n01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,480\nit doesn't function like a mouse.\n\n1289\n01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,630\nSo, you do actually have to match them up.\n\n1290\n01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:54,510\nThese connectors themselves were\ntypical 6-pin connectors, smaller,\n\n1291\n01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:59,050\nand this is what we're referring\nto in another segment of our show.\n\n1292\n01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,170\nWe said that this could be\nvery easily confused with the,\n\n1293\n01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,170\nis it the S video connector\nis what we were thinking of?\n\n1294\n01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,170\n>> Yeah.\nThe S video looks almost identical except\n\n1295\n01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,100\nit's only got four pins inside of it so\nit's really easy to mix these up.\n\n1296\n01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,060\nS video you really didn't use\non computers but PS/2 you did.\n\n1297\n01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,730\n>> And we're getting some\nshout outs in the chat room.\n\n1298\n01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:19,500\nMuch like me, my first computer\nthat I built out had PS/2 and\n\n1299\n01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,910\nmy cables were just gray.\n\n1300\n01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,990\nI had two gray cables and\nyou wouldn't know which was which.\n\n1301\n01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:27,370\nThe color coding came\nout a little bit later.\n\n1302\n01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:31,350\nIf you see the cables today, they will\nbe color coded but, in the early days,\n\n1303\n01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,930\nthey actually weren't and\nit was super easy to mix them up.\n\n1304\n01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:37,157\nNow, the big problem with mixing them up,\nyou wouldn't hurt the devices.\n\n1305\n01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:38,886\nIf you plugged them in backwards\nit didn't hurt them at all but\n\n1306\n01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:40,240\nyour computer wouldn't detect the device.\n\n1307\n01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,064\nYou would boot it up and\nit would say, no keyboard found.\n\n1308\n01:08:43,064 --> 01:08:45,510\nIt was just plugged into the mouse port.\n\n1309\n01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,240\nSo you would have to switch them.\n\n1310\n01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,310\nBut the problem with these devices is they\nhad to be hooked up when you booted up.\n\n1311\n01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:55,150\nPS2 was not plug-n-play you couldn't bring\nthem in and out while the system was on,\n\n1312\n01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,680\nthey weren't hot pluggable.\n\n1313\n01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,500\nSo, you would have to turn the computer\noff, switch the cables around and\n\n1314\n01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,770\nboot them back up.\n\n1315\n01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,040\nAnd so that's where\nthe color-coding came along and\n\n1316\n01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,730\nstarted to make that big difference.\n\n1317\n01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,940\nSo, when you look at the ports.\n\n1318\n01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:09,130\nLet me grab a motherboard here.\n\n1319\n01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,910\nSo, if you even have\nthe ports on your computer,\n\n1320\n01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,630\ncuz a lot of them don't have it any more.\n\n1321\n01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:16,810\nBut if you do have the ports,\nthey'll typically be color coded today.\n\n1322\n01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,680\nAnd it's hard to mix them up.\n\n1323\n01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,940\nRight, now they don't bother labeling\nthem cuz that would be crazy talk.\n\n1324\n01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,960\nSo if you don't have a matching color,\nit can be hard to remember there.\n\n1325\n01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,750\nBut the cable will fit in either.\n\n1326\n01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,373\nSo I'm gonna take my keyboard here which\nis purple, jumped out, it's like a snake\n\n1327\n01:09:31,373 --> 01:09:32,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1328\n01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,220\n>> So I'm gonna take the purple one here,\n\n1329\n01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,780\nand I'll just plug it right\ninto the keyboard connector and\n\n1330\n01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,928\nyou'll see there it is, let me do it,\nit's the exact same connector.\n\n1331\n01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:44,630\nIt's the PS/2 connector but I've gotta\nmake sure it's in the right one so\n\n1332\n01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,050\njust be aware they're not interchangeable.\n\n1333\n01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:51,550\nI have seen some laptops that have this\non here and it'll actually have a little\n\n1334\n01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:56,100\nslash and be half purple, half green,\nand that means it supports either one.\n\n1335\n01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,290\nA mouse or a keyboard.\n\n1336\n01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,490\nThat's not a standard.\n\n1337\n01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,060\nThat's just something that some\nof the laptop vendors did.\n\n1338\n01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,070\nAnd it can only support one device.\n\n1339\n01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:03,820\nYou pick.\n\n1340\n01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:07,230\nYou can plug in a keyboard or\na mouse, but not both.\n\n1341\n01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,090\nSo that's one of the things\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n1342\n01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:13,300\nNow, this is an older connector.\n\n1343\n01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:17,290\nAlmost every modern computer is\ngonna come with a USB keyboard and\n\n1344\n01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:21,180\na USB mouse but in the event that you\nstill have PS/2 equipment they actually do\n\n1345\n01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:26,260\nmake adapters where you can convert\nthe PS/2 ports into USB and plug them in.\n\n1346\n01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,910\nI know we're got some of\nthose in the server room for\n\n1347\n01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:31,790\nsome servers that where we\ngot a KVM that's PS2 and\n\n1348\n01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:34,466\nwe just didn't want to replace\nit cuz we're tight wads [LAUGH].\n\n1349\n01:10:34,466 --> 01:10:36,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But so you can get things like that.\n\n1350\n01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,530\nThe adapters work okay but\nmost people have switched to USB today and\n\n1351\n01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,280\nyou really don't see PS2 anymore.\n\n1352\n01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,160\nIn fact the only reason we have these,\n\n1353\n01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,740\nis we ordered a batch of\nthin clients from Wyse.\n\n1354\n01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,240\nWyse is now owned by Dell,\n\n1355\n01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,000\nbut they're one of the largest thin\nclient manufacturers in the world.\n\n1356\n01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,310\nAnd they ship PS2 standard\non their thin clients.\n\n1357\n01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,260\nThey don't use USB.\n\n1358\n01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,250\nAnd I'm not entirely\nsure why they do that,\n\n1359\n01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,930\nprobably to keep the cost low on them.\n\n1360\n01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:04,070\nBut you do still see devices that you can\nbuy right now, that still ship with PS/2.\n\n1361\n01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:09,120\nIt's just very, very, very uncommon.\n\n1362\n01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, that is PS2.\n\n1363\n01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,720\nJust remember,\nit can be mixed up with s-video.\n\n1364\n01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,580\nTwo completely different things.\n\n1365\n01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,100\nAll right,\nthe next one on our list is Parallel,\n\n1366\n01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,800\nthis is another port\nthat's effectively dead.\n\n1367\n01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,200\nWe really don't see this one very much,\nbut in the old days,\n\n1368\n01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,010\nif you wanted to hook a printer or\nsometimes a scanner up to your computer,\n\n1369\n01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,940\nyou would use what was\ncalled a parallel port.\n\n1370\n01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,310\nThere were a number of different\ndevices out there that did it, for\n\n1371\n01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,560\nthose of you that have been\ninto computing a while,\n\n1372\n01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,200\nyou might remember like Z- Zip drives and\nthose things.\n\n1373\n01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,250\nThey had parallel port versions.\n\n1374\n01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,270\nParallel ports are not very fast.\n\n1375\n01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:42,060\nThey're not designed to\ntransmit large amounts of data.\n\n1376\n01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,380\nReally, we used them for printers\nbecause printing is pretty simple.\n\n1377\n01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:48,290\nYou send an image of a page to\na printer and it prints it out.\n\n1378\n01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:52,620\nSo on the back of a lot of computers,\nyou would have a full size printer port,\n\n1379\n01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,870\nwhich was this purple port right here.\n\n1380\n01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:57,407\nThis is a parallel port, and\n\n1381\n01:11:57,407 --> 01:12:00,491\nit would communicate with\ntypically a printer, right?\n\n1382\n01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:04,799\nThe actual cable connector looked like\nthis and they were normally 24 pins\n\n1383\n01:12:04,799 --> 01:12:05,425\n>> 25 pins.\n\n1384\n01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:05,948\n>> Is that right?\n\n1385\n01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:06,482\n25 pins.\n\n1386\n01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:07,527\nI'm shorting us one.\n\n1387\n01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:11,776\nSo 25 pins and\nyou hook it up and off you go.\n\n1388\n01:12:11,776 --> 01:12:14,098\nNow the other end of the cable\ncould be God only knows what.\n\n1389\n01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:18,550\nIt could be a regular 25 pin connector.\n\n1390\n01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:21,890\nBut a lot of times it was this guy right\nhere which is a centronics connector.\n\n1391\n01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:23,220\nIt's a bizarre cable.\n\n1392\n01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:28,180\nIt was really just used for printers and I\ndid see one scanner once that used it but\n\n1393\n01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,518\nthat was.\n\n1394\n01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:32,930\n>> Now, the earliest types of these\ncables were only uni-directional, so\n\n1395\n01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:36,410\nit allowed you to send, but you couldn't\nactually receive any data back.\n\n1396\n01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,010\nAnd I'm going, well, why would you care,\nif you're only printing?\n\n1397\n01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:40,370\nWell, if you had paper jams,\n\n1398\n01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,225\nyou wouldn't actually be able\nto tell there was a paper jam.\n\n1399\n01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:42,902\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Don,\n\n1400\n01:12:42,902 --> 01:12:45,979\nI remember in college I went to print\nsomething and said I'll go to my next\n\n1401\n01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:49,130\nclass, I'll come back,\nit'll be printed out and ready to go.\n\n1402\n01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,015\nWell it printed everything\non one sheet of paper.\n\n1403\n01:12:51,015 --> 01:12:53,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One sheet of paper like a ten page\n\n1404\n01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,170\npaper printed out on one\nline on one sheet of paper.\n\n1405\n01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,695\nAnd it just continued to run.\n\n1406\n01:12:57,695 --> 01:13:01,665\nSo, those unidirectional, as neat as\nit sounds, they weren't really neat.\n\n1407\n01:13:01,665 --> 01:13:02,255\nMost of them,\n\n1408\n01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:06,075\nactually, then became bidirectional\nprinter cables, very quickly.\n\n1409\n01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:10,500\n>> Another port type that's very\nsimilar to this is a serial port.\n\n1410\n01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,300\nNow serial ports were used for\nthings like modems or\n\n1411\n01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,160\nconnecting to the internet\nvia telephone line or mice.\n\n1412\n01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,957\nMy first mouse was a serial port mouse.\n\n1413\n01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:20,465\n>> Mine too, yep.\n\n1414\n01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:23,060\n>> So instead of PS2,\nI would plug it into a serial port.\n\n1415\n01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,690\nYou could get some receipt printers and\n\n1416\n01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,630\nthings that would use\nserial port connections.\n\n1417\n01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:30,550\nSerial port is really easy to mix up with\nparallel port because they look very,\n\n1418\n01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,800\nvery similar.\n\n1419\n01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,890\nHere's that parallel port.\n\n1420\n01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:38,210\n25 pins and then right beside it here\nI've got a nine pin serial port.\n\n1421\n01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,550\nNow, because they're similar,\n\n1422\n01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,120\nwhat they did is they reversed the gender\non them to help tell them apart.\n\n1423\n01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,450\nSo you'll notice the gender on this one,\nthis is a male connector.\n\n1424\n01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:48,610\nI've got little copper pins in there, and\n\n1425\n01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:52,120\non the cable, I'm gonna have\na female connector, and there it is.\n\n1426\n01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,850\nNine pins and it's a female connector.\n\n1427\n01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,530\nThat being said,\n\n1428\n01:13:56,530 --> 01:14:01,600\nit is the exact same shape as the VGA\nconnector we saw earlier in the show.\n\n1429\n01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,300\nThose become pretty easy to mix up too.\n\n1430\n01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,790\nJust remember that VGA is 15 pins\nversus serial which is nine pins.\n\n1431\n01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,910\nNow there was another serial standard too.\n\n1432\n01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,190\nNow that one was a 24-pin wasn't it?\n\n1433\n01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,390\nThe longer one?\n\n1434\n01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:19,840\nSo there was a longer connector for serial\nthat you really just don't see very often.\n\n1435\n01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,800\nThis the most common type of\nserial port that's available.\n\n1436\n01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,070\nSo, if you had external modems,\nif you had mice, devices like that,\n\n1437\n01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,500\nyou'd plug in on serial,\nand it was available.\n\n1438\n01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,790\nThese are going away,\n\n1439\n01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:34,280\nit's actually getting to be hard to\nfind computers that have these any more.\n\n1440\n01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,400\nI have a particular use case where I\ndo need serial port, even today, and\n\n1441\n01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,000\nso I had to buy a USB\nto serial port adapter.\n\n1442\n01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,240\nSo, I can plug into my USB port and\nyou can still get those, right.\n\n1443\n01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,120\nUSB is the standard now, so you can find\nadapters now that will really adapt to any\n\n1444\n01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,630\nof these to USB and\nthat's what you have to do.\n\n1445\n01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n1446\n01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,550\nAnd Don, you mentioned the idea\nof the genders of those ports, so\n\n1447\n01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,970\nremember that cables too\nwill also have genders.\n\n1448\n01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,800\nSo when you need the right one,\n\n1449\n01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,220\nremember you also want to make sure\nyou pick out the ones that you need.\n\n1450\n01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,510\nSo if the port is a male port,\nyou need, of course,\n\n1451\n01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,130\nthen a connector that's\ngoing to be a female gender.\n\n1452\n01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,770\nAnd then, of course,\n\n1453\n01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:12,320\nif the port is like the parallel\nport printer that we just saw.\n\n1454\n01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,560\nThat 25 pin connector which is a female\nport, it means that the cable, of course,\n\n1455\n01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,040\nhas to have the male\nconnector on that end too.\n\n1456\n01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,360\nThose are fairly important to remember.\n\n1457\n01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,150\n>> All right.\nSo, that's pretty much that for serial.\n\n1458\n01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,060\nAnd is that the last of our legacy cables?\n\n1459\n01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:27,700\n>> It is.\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n1460\n01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,840\nWell, I guess we've I\nsort of have one more.\n\n1461\n01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,850\nThe next two connectors that we're going\nto see are very similar, they are used for\n\n1462\n01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:40,214\nnetwork connectivity on a computer, and\nthe first one is what's called RJ-45.\n\n1463\n01:15:40,214 --> 01:15:45,570\nR.J stands for Registered Jack and\nthis is just something that has been\n\n1464\n01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:50,760\nstandardized by the IEC, the International\nElectrode Technical Commission,\n\n1465\n01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,880\nand these are the guys that\ncertify cable designs or whatever.\n\n1466\n01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,050\nAnd RJ-45 is typically used for\nnetworking.\n\n1467\n01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:01,890\nSo you will see an RJ-45 jack\non this board right here.\n\n1468\n01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,030\nAnd that's for\nplugging in a network cable.\n\n1469\n01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,250\nAnd, here, I'll hold this,\nwhile you hook up the cable, Ronnie.\n\n1470\n01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,896\nSo, Ronnie's got an RJ 45 cable,\noff camera.\n\n1471\n01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:09,454\n>> Sorry.\n\n1472\n01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:11,507\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1473\n01:16:11,507 --> 01:16:14,440\n>> And so, he's got the cable right there,\nand what it is,\n\n1474\n01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:18,925\nis eight copper wires, that\nare arranged inside of a connector and\n\n1475\n01:16:18,925 --> 01:16:23,515\nit leads those eight little copper pads,\nyou can kind of see right there.\n\n1476\n01:16:23,515 --> 01:16:26,515\nWhen you pop it into this connector,\nthere's eight little copper\n\n1477\n01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:30,375\nwires there that apply pressure, and\nthat creates your network connection.\n\n1478\n01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:30,895\nAll right.\n\n1479\n01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:35,265\nSo when you see that, that kind of\nwide-ish jack with a little tab on\n\n1480\n01:16:35,265 --> 01:16:39,010\nthe top, that's your network jack and\nit's called an R J 45 cable.\n\n1481\n01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:46,380\nIf you've got a wired network connection,\nyou'll use cables like these.\n\n1482\n01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:49,690\nYou'll hear people call\nthese CAT5 cables sometimes.\n\n1483\n01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:52,170\nWhen you say CAT5 you're actually\ntalking about the cable itself,\n\n1484\n01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:56,690\nthe cable might be CAT5 or CAT6 that just\nmeans category five or category six.\n\n1485\n01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,700\nIt's a type of cable.\n\n1486\n01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,770\nWhen we say RJ-45 we're\ntalking about the end.\n\n1487\n01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:05,790\nThis actual connector is\nan RJ-45 connector and\n\n1488\n01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,800\nit's just used for networking.\n\n1489\n01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,370\nSo we'll plug that in and\nthat'll give us our network connection.\n\n1490\n01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,230\nNow you might have wireless\nin your computer and\n\n1491\n01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,490\nyou don't need this cable at all right.\n\n1492\n01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,610\nWireless kind of removes the need for\nthis.\n\n1493\n01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:20,350\nBut you still get the best speeds and\nreliability out of a wired connection,\n\n1494\n01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,400\nand so most computers still have it.\n\n1495\n01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:27,609\nAll right, now, there is a sister\ncable to this one called RJ-11.\n\n1496\n01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:30,910\nRJ-11 is the same thing as RJ-45,\n\n1497\n01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:35,540\nexcept only four wires instead of eight,\nand that means it's thinner.\n\n1498\n01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:36,930\nIt looks almost identical.\n\n1499\n01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,590\nIt's gotta tab on top and\nthe connector looks similar but\n\n1500\n01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,000\nit's thinner and it's for telephone lines.\n\n1501\n01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,010\nSo if you've ever plugged a telephone line\ninto a physical wall jack, I feel like I\n\n1502\n01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:49,780\nshouldn't have to say that but in today's\nworld not everybody has done that.\n\n1503\n01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,900\nWe have cell phones and stuff.\n\n1504\n01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,490\nWe don't necessarily plug that in.\n\n1505\n01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:56,160\nBut the old phone jacks were RJ-11.\n\n1506\n01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,510\nThey looked a lot like\nnetwork connections,\n\n1507\n01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:03,210\nwhich were just the same plug but eight\nwires wide, which is a wider connection.\n\n1508\n01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:04,480\nEasy to mix them up.\n\n1509\n01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,700\nYou can plug a phone line into\na network jack by accident,\n\n1510\n01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,990\nbecause the network jack is wider.\n\n1511\n01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:12,250\nIt won't work, but you can do it.\n\n1512\n01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,480\nAnd, you actually can damage your\nnetwork adapter if you do that because\n\n1513\n01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,160\nthe phone line can carry\nvoltage when it rings.\n\n1514\n01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,600\nIf you plug that in, and\nsomebody tries to call and\n\n1515\n01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,150\nit rings, that's a spike in voltage and\nit can damage your network adapter.\n\n1516\n01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,230\nSo you definitely don't want to do that,\nright?\n\n1517\n01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,750\nBut if you have a modem, for\ncommunicating over a phone line,\n\n1518\n01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,100\nyou can plug that into your computer.\n\n1519\n01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,310\nNow today very, very few people use\nphone lines on their computer, for\n\n1520\n01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,940\nat least accessing the internet,\nbecause it's just so slow, right?\n\n1521\n01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,890\nIt's a pittance compared to\nthe bandwidth we get with DSL and cable.\n\n1522\n01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,220\nSo we really don't see that so\nmuch anymore.\n\n1523\n01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,160\nBut if you wanna send\nfaxes from your computer,\n\n1524\n01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,390\nit's one of the easiest ways to do it.\n\n1525\n01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:53,380\nYou plug a phone line into your computer,\nand you start to send faxes.\n\n1526\n01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,240\nBut most computers these days don't\neven come with a modem, and so\n\n1527\n01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,850\nit's not really an option.\n\n1528\n01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,430\n>> Yeah, Don.\nI think you were the only one that,\n\n1529\n01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,400\nwhen I asked why in the world would\nwe still keep a modem around and\n\n1530\n01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,815\nyou were saying that when you\nworked in the insurance business\n\n1531\n01:19:06,815 --> 01:19:07,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1532\n01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,820\n>> That what ended up happening is that\nthey would go to these disaster areas, and\n\n1533\n01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,690\nthey would restore the phone service\nfirst, and not internet service.\n\n1534\n01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:19,430\nSo if you actually were sending people out\nto take a look at the different claims\n\n1535\n01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,535\nthat were being made,\nthey had to connect back in.\n\n1536\n01:19:22,535 --> 01:19:26,460\nYou always sent out one that\nhad modems on those devices.\n\n1537\n01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:31,890\n>> Yeah, for most emergency systems they\ntreat phones as a critical service so\n\n1538\n01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:34,240\nthey're gonna bring those online\nas quick as fast as they can.\n\n1539\n01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,160\nSo all of our insurance adjusters that\nwere going out in the field would take\n\n1540\n01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,550\nlaptops that had modems.\n\n1541\n01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,860\nAnd that way they can plug in and dial\ninto our main insurance headquarters to\n\n1542\n01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,840\nget data and cut checks and\nall the other stuff they needed to do.\n\n1543\n01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,670\nSo that was pretty important and\nwe maintained that system the whole time.\n\n1544\n01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,620\nBut for most people it's not.\n\n1545\n01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:54,040\nAll right,\nthe next on our list is audio Ronnie.\n\n1546\n01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,785\nWhat's our normal audio cable?\n\n1547\n01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:57,263\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gonna be like today.\n\n1548\n01:19:57,263 --> 01:20:02,155\n>> Our normal audio cable for the back of\nthe computer is a single one eighth inch\n\n1549\n01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:06,602\njack and a lot of times those are also\ncolor coded being a light green.\n\n1550\n01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:11,024\nNow, of course we can't just\nuse a simple little cable,\n\n1551\n01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:14,380\nthe one that we have is [LAUGH] monstrous.\n\n1552\n01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,690\n>> When we talk about audio cable jacks,\n\n1553\n01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,520\nmost people just call\nthem headphone jacks.\n\n1554\n01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,452\nWhen you have consumer grade headphones,\nthey have a little, is it 3.5 millimeter?\n\n1555\n01:20:22,452 --> 01:20:24,280\n>> 3.5 millimeter, one eighth inch.\n\n1556\n01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,442\n>> Little one eighth inch jack.\n\n1557\n01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:31,212\nAnd it's on every cell phone and\niPod, whatever mp3 player you use,\n\n1558\n01:20:31,212 --> 01:20:36,440\nthey've got these standard jacks and\nyou can plug your speakers into that,\n\n1559\n01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,930\nyou can plug your headphones,\nbut they're just stereo jacks.\n\n1560\n01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:41,780\nThey send a left and\na right signal and that's it.\n\n1561\n01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:45,020\nThey don't do 5.1 surround and so on.\n\n1562\n01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:48,150\nSo to plug into it,\nyou'll have a jack that'll look like this.\n\n1563\n01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:52,260\nAnd if you look at this cable connector,\nit's a copper pin.\n\n1564\n01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,310\nIt's just one pin.\n\n1565\n01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,620\nWell how does it send a left and a right?\n\n1566\n01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,580\nWell, you can sorta say these little.\n\n1567\n01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,560\nLet me move down here a little-\n>> Stripes.\n\n1568\n01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,590\n>> It's kinda yellow behind it.\n\n1569\n01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,020\nThere's these little black stripes on it.\n\n1570\n01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:05,940\nAnd that's actually plastic, and\nit's separating the copper bands.\n\n1571\n01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,350\nSo even though it looks like there's\none pin, there's actually three.\n\n1572\n01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,210\nThere's the left, the right,\nand a neutral or ground,\n\n1573\n01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,740\nI forget what it is,\nthat kind of levels out the sound.\n\n1574\n01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,840\nAnd so that's how it's able\nto carry the various signals.\n\n1575\n01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,030\nIf you don't see those bands or\n\n1576\n01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:22,080\nif you just see one band,\nthen you've got a mono cable.\n\n1577\n01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,750\nIt's just sending one signal instead of\ntwo, but it just pops right in there.\n\n1578\n01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,687\nThey're not normally\ngigantic like this one.\n\n1579\n01:21:28,687 --> 01:21:30,648\nThis is a high quality cable.\n\n1580\n01:21:30,648 --> 01:21:31,671\nWell, I suppose.\n\n1581\n01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:33,500\nBut it just pops right in here.\n\n1582\n01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,780\nYou'll notice that we've got the same\nexact type of jack right here for\n\n1583\n01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,030\na microphone, and if you mix them up,\nthey don't work, right?\n\n1584\n01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,220\nBut a lot of microphones\nwill plug in that way.\n\n1585\n01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:45,290\nLot of modern microphones have gone USB\nbecause it's digital and you get better\n\n1586\n01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,950\nsound out of them, but you can still get\nmicrophones that plug right in there.\n\n1587\n01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:54,820\nYou might have a headset that you\nwear that has both the microphone and\n\n1588\n01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,640\nthe headphone jack in it, right?\n\n1589\n01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,820\nThe microphone to be able to talk into\nit and the ear piece so you can hear.\n\n1590\n01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,210\nSo it'll plug into both those jacks.\n\n1591\n01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,840\nThat's not uncommon either.\n\n1592\n01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,950\nThey may be color coded, they may not.\n\n1593\n01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,810\nThey may be labeled.\n\n1594\n01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:10,340\nYou may have little icons that\nrepresent speakers, versus microphones.\n\n1595\n01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:14,740\nBut the connector is just a 3.5\nmillimeter, or one eight inch jack.\n\n1596\n01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:17,150\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n1597\n01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:22,970\nthat brings us to our final cable of\nthe day, which is the power cable.\n\n1598\n01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:26,360\nYou're not gonna get very far\non your computer without power.\n\n1599\n01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,100\nSo we've got to apply that.\n\n1600\n01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,360\nNow the power cable used in the computer\nis kind of different from the power\n\n1601\n01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,490\ncable used in most electrical appliances.\n\n1602\n01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,070\nMost electrical appliances come\nwith the power cable built into it.\n\n1603\n01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:40,350\nIf you buy a blender or a microwave,\nyou can't take that cable off.\n\n1604\n01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,380\nBut computers have removable cables.\n\n1605\n01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:46,630\nAnd the main reason they do that is so\nthat they can create one computer and\n\n1606\n01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,160\nthen use it in multiple countries.\n\n1607\n01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,230\nDifferent countries have different power\nstandards, so they have to change that.\n\n1608\n01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:55,360\nAnd when you buy an appliance,\nyou're not normally gonna carry it,\n\n1609\n01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,990\nI'm not gonna take a microwave with\nme when I go on a road trip, so\n\n1610\n01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:02,030\nthey design it for one country and\nthat's it, but computers they design for\n\n1611\n01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:03,860\nas many countries as possible.\n\n1612\n01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:10,610\nSo on the computer side, you're going\nto have a jack that looks like this.\n\n1613\n01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,490\nThis'll be on the back of the computer,\nit's a little three prong jack, and\n\n1614\n01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:16,610\nthey call this a D plug because\nif you hold it like that,\n\n1615\n01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,740\nit's kind of shaped like the letter D.\n\n1616\n01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:23,400\nBut inside it there's three connectors\nthat match up with the three types of\n\n1617\n01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,050\npower that we can draw from a wall jack.\n\n1618\n01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:29,610\nAnd the cable that we plug into it,\nlooks like this.\n\n1619\n01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:32,160\nIt's a female connector\nthat has the three slots.\n\n1620\n01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,350\nThey line up, it only goes in one way.\n\n1621\n01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:37,860\nThere's no way to mix this up,\nbecause it's shaped like the letter D, and\n\n1622\n01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,310\nwe pop that in and we're ready to rock.\n\n1623\n01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:44,150\nAll right, now,\nthat's not the end of it though.\n\n1624\n01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,330\nThis is one of the easiest cables.\n\n1625\n01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:48,820\nWe can't mix up where it goes, but\nthe other end of the cable is tricky.\n\n1626\n01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,540\nAll right.\n\n1627\n01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,900\nThe other end of the cable\nmay be like ours.\n\n1628\n01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,090\nThis one is for use in the United States.\n\n1629\n01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:54,840\nSo, on one end.\n\n1630\n01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,300\nActually, let me get rid\nof this power supply.\n\n1631\n01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,280\nGo ahead and drop it.\n\n1632\n01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,330\nOn one end I've got that D plug,\nsure, and on the other end I've got\n\n1633\n01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,070\nthe three pronged wall jack that\nwe use here in the United States.\n\n1634\n01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:09,030\nSo it's got our regular connectors,\n\n1635\n01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:13,640\nand then it's got our ground right here\nto be able to plug into a wall jack.\n\n1636\n01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:17,270\nIn the United States, our wall jacks\ntypically provide 120 watts of power.\n\n1637\n01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:19,440\nMost of our devices are 110 watts.\n\n1638\n01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,760\nBut in other countries,\n240 watts is pretty common.\n\n1639\n01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,060\nOr your devices might draw 210 watts.\n\n1640\n01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:30,410\nSo you could see a number of other\nconnectors on the other end of this cable,\n\n1641\n01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:32,150\ndepending what country you're in.\n\n1642\n01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,830\nSo before this show we grabbed bunch\nof them for different countries.\n\n1643\n01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:40,650\nSo I've spent some time in France and\nover in France, they use this connector,\n\n1644\n01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:44,880\nwhere it's just two circular pins and\nthat's it.\n\n1645\n01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,610\nSo if your computer's gonna be plugging in\n\n1646\n01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,340\nover there it's gotta be\nready to handle that.\n\n1647\n01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:54,230\nIt's gotta be ready for a 240 watt\nconnection using this type of connector.\n\n1648\n01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:58,880\nAnd you've got other ones for England,\nIreland, the Philippines, wherever.\n\n1649\n01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,800\nDifferent connectors for\ndifferent purposes,\n\n1650\n01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,510\nactually I think in the Philippines\nthey use ours cuz the US was there for\n\n1651\n01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:08,270\na long time, but you got different\nconnectors that you might see, so\n\n1652\n01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:13,240\njust be aware that some of these\nare really different to us here in the US.\n\n1653\n01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,370\nBut you might be looking at this video\nright now going, oh, yeah, yeah,\n\n1654\n01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:18,140\nthat's the connector I use every day,\nthat's how I charge my cell phone.\n\n1655\n01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:22,750\nSo the cool thing about modern electronics\nis when they manufacture these,\n\n1656\n01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,780\nwell they are all manufactured\nin China anyway right,\n\n1657\n01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,360\nso over there they are already having\na plan for the different power, and\n\n1658\n01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,700\nwhen they design it they say they want\nto make it as flexible as possible.\n\n1659\n01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:36,430\nSo the power supplies are normally\nrated to handle both, 120 and 240,\n\n1660\n01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,840\nthey are ready to go.\n\n1661\n01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,100\nThis power supply that I\nshowed you guys a moment ago,\n\n1662\n01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,570\nit is what's called\nan adaptive power supply.\n\n1663\n01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:48,070\nIt will do 120 or 240, it doesn't care.\n\n1664\n01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:50,762\nSo as long as I get the right cable,\nI can plug it in and\n\n1665\n01:25:50,762 --> 01:25:54,394\nthis power supply'll work just fine and\nmy computer will work great.\n\n1666\n01:25:54,394 --> 01:25:58,642\nBut not every power supply is like that,\nso on some computers\n\n1667\n01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:03,307\nyou will see a little switch on\nthe back where you can flip between,\n\n1668\n01:26:03,307 --> 01:26:08,250\nit will either say 120 and\n240 or it might say 110 and 220.\n\n1669\n01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,810\nIt's the same thing, you flip back and\nforth If you're in the United States,\n\n1670\n01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,110\nyou flip it over to 110.\n\n1671\n01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,790\nIf you're in Europe or\n\n1672\n01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:18,940\nAsia, wherever, pretty much the rest\nof the world, you flip it over to 220.\n\n1673\n01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,270\nAnd you're good to go there.\n\n1674\n01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:23,400\nSo you might have\na physical switch on there.\n\n1675\n01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,230\nAnd if it's wrong,\nyour device probably won't work.\n\n1676\n01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:27,650\nBut if it's right, it will.\n\n1677\n01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,090\nThe cable itself,\nyou just buy the right cable.\n\n1678\n01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,000\nThere's no special logic there.\n\n1679\n01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,190\nAnd off you go.\n\n1680\n01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,890\nSo this end though is common.\n\n1681\n01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:38,490\nThe D plug end, that's pretty common\nacross all the different systems\n\n1682\n01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:39,690\nregardless of what country you're in.\n\n1683\n01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:44,660\nAll right, so that's basically it for\nthe power connector.\n\n1684\n01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,160\nLaptops are a different story.\n\n1685\n01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,240\nLaptops normally have\na transformer in them,\n\n1686\n01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:52,260\nand the reason they do that is\nlaptops have batteries also.\n\n1687\n01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,420\nWhen you have a battery,\nnow you have two different types of power.\n\n1688\n01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,310\nAnd CompTIA even calls this out,\nthey call it AC, DC, all right.\n\n1689\n01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,990\nAnd they're not talking\nabout the rock band,\n\n1690\n01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,530\nalthough knowledge of that\nprobably wouldn't hurt you.\n\n1691\n01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:07,350\nBut what they're talking about is\nalternating current and direct current.\n\n1692\n01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,350\nWhen you plug into a wall jack,\nyou're getting,\n\n1693\n01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,268\nlet's see if I can keep this straight-\n>> Alternating current.\n\n1694\n01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,518\n>> Alternating current.\n\n1695\n01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:15,470\nBut when you're on a battery,\nyou're getting direct current.\n\n1696\n01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,570\nTwo different types of electricity.\n\n1697\n01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:21,520\nSo a laptop has to be able to\nconvert that, and that's what that\n\n1698\n01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,790\ntransformer is doing, that big block,\nwhen you plug into a wall jack,\n\n1699\n01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,610\nwhich I guess, we had them up here,\nbut we're using them.\n\n1700\n01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:32,680\nSo that big jack, when you plug into\na wall jack, that's what that's doing,\n\n1701\n01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,140\nis it's taking the alternating current and\nconverting it to direct current.\n\n1702\n01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,480\nBut when you're on battery,\na battery gives you direct current, so\n\n1703\n01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,810\nyou get exactly what you want.\n\n1704\n01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,100\nOh, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n1705\n01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:47,520\nRonnie just brought his up, so he's got\nthat little Dell box, this box right here.\n\n1706\n01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,510\nSo, when you plug a laptop in, you need\nthis to convert the power type, all right?\n\n1707\n01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:56,030\nSome laptops might have that internally,\nbut it makes the laptops big, so\n\n1708\n01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:59,690\na lot of people put it outside so\nthat it's not so big.\n\n1709\n01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,819\nAnd they can make your laptop smaller.\n\n1710\n01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,089\nBut if you've got a desktop, it just plugs\nright into the wall, and that's because\n\n1711\n01:28:06,089 --> 01:28:09,423\nyour desktop doesn't have a battery, so\nit can deal with just alternating current.\n\n1712\n01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:11,659\nTwo different types of power,\n\n1713\n01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:16,390\nand so that's the difference\nbetween those cables, all right?\n\n1714\n01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,070\nAlso, the tiny circular plug they\nput on laptops is nice and small,\n\n1715\n01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,600\nversus this D plug which is kinda giant.\n\n1716\n01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,795\nLaptops these days aren't normally\neven as thick as those D plugs, but\n\n1717\n01:28:24,795 --> 01:28:27,425\npretty thin as fat plugs\nwouldn't work out.\n\n1718\n01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:30,705\n>> Yeah, and your plug's actually a little\nbit different on yours, isn't it?\n\n1719\n01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,147\nIt's not an actual direct plugin.\n\n1720\n01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:33,945\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a kind of magnetic kind of thing.\n\n1721\n01:28:33,945 --> 01:28:35,745\nLet me see if I can show that.\n\n1722\n01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:41,195\nSome vendors have started switching to\nthese because they're a little bit safer.\n\n1723\n01:28:41,195 --> 01:28:44,785\nHere, let me disconnect my screen share\n\n1724\n01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:47,060\nbecause I don't need to\nshare my screen anymore.\n\n1725\n01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,280\nSo I can move my laptop,\ninto the limelight here.\n\n1726\n01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:51,981\nSo let me.\n\n1727\n01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:55,970\n[LAUGH] Give me just a second while I do\nthat, and I'll show you what I've got.\n\n1728\n01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,910\nIt's just a little magnetic connector,\nand the laptop vendors and stuff.\n\n1729\n01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:03,130\nThey can choose to use whatever\ntype of connector they want.\n\n1730\n01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:04,290\nIt's up to them.\n\n1731\n01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:07,516\nBut they typically follow the standards,\nif they can.\n\n1732\n01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:12,630\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nlet's show my laptop on the SkyCam.\n\n1733\n01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:17,390\nI wanna show the actual laptop and\nnot my screen this time.\n\n1734\n01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:21,410\nBut so here's, so it's now unplugged,\nso, here's my laptop.\n\n1735\n01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:23,650\nAnd the power connector is right there,\nand\n\n1736\n01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,670\nyou'll notice it's not\na giant recessed thing.\n\n1737\n01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:29,800\nIt's just four little copper\npins that are right there.\n\n1738\n01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,940\nThere are five.\n\n1739\n01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:36,070\nAnd what I've got is my\nPower cable looks like this.\n\n1740\n01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,870\nIt's flat.\n\n1741\n01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,410\nIt's weird, right?\n\n1742\n01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:40,850\nAnd they just made it where it's magnetic,\nso\n\n1743\n01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:43,760\nthat it'll stick on and\nthe magnet holds it in place.\n\n1744\n01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,520\n>> That's cool.\n>> And the reason they did that\n\n1745\n01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,120\n>> Is people\n\n1746\n01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,210\ntrip over the cables all the time.\n\n1747\n01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:52,380\nAnd that port, on most laptops, is\nsoldered to the mother board inside of it,\n\n1748\n01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,990\nand the solder can break.\n\n1749\n01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:56,150\nWhen that port gets loose,\nit can start to spark.\n\n1750\n01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:58,440\nAnd eventually your laptop\nwill stop charging.\n\n1751\n01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,650\nAnd a lot of people say oh,\nmy battery doesn't work anymore.\n\n1752\n01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,930\nMy laptop won't charge.\n\n1753\n01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,870\n>> And\nit's not the laptop that's the problem, or\n\n1754\n01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,560\nthe battery that's the problem,\nit's just the port.\n\n1755\n01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,060\nBut since it's attached\nto the motherboard,\n\n1756\n01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:11,230\nit can be a pretty expensive repair unless\nyou're handy with a soldering iron.\n\n1757\n01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:16,030\nI can't even count how many of\nthose I've replaced over the years.\n\n1758\n01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:19,310\nBut you'll see these\nconnectors on some devices.\n\n1759\n01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,680\nAgain, just a quick and easy attach and\n\n1760\n01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,640\ndisconnect, makes it where you\ncan't really mix those up.\n\n1761\n01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,070\nAnd this gives us a chance to show some of\nthe other ports right here on the laptop.\n\n1762\n01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:31,410\nI've got my power, there's my two\nthunderbolts, I've got USB 3,\n\n1763\n01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:34,850\nthis is USB 3 and notice it's not blue.\n\n1764\n01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:36,800\nIt doesn't have to be blue.\n\n1765\n01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,590\nI know that's USB 3 because\nit's in the manual.\n\n1766\n01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:42,800\nAnd then I've got a headphone\njack right there I can plug in,\n\n1767\n01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,530\nthat's the standard 3.5 millimeter jack.\n\n1768\n01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:51,430\nOn my other side I've\ngot HDMI right there and\n\n1769\n01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:55,430\nI've got USB right there I've got my\nlittle wireless track ball plugged in.\n\n1770\n01:30:55,430 --> 01:31:00,540\nSo those are all kind of ports that we'll\nsee on laptops as we work with those.\n\n1771\n01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,102\nCause you know laptops\nhave different needs.\n\n1772\n01:31:02,102 --> 01:31:07,830\nAll right, well Ronnie look I'm looking\nat my notes here and I think that\n\n1773\n01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,050\ngets us through all the different cables\nthat CompTIA calls out for the exam.\n\n1774\n01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:11,550\n>> It does.\n\n1775\n01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:16,100\n>> All right, so keep in mind guys,\nthat these are just the most common ones,\n\n1776\n01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,680\nthere are other cables out there.\n\n1777\n01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,000\nIt doesn't hurt to know them.\n\n1778\n01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,240\nBut for the exam, these are the ones\nyou need to be familiar with.\n\n1779\n01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,690\nYou just need to know which\ncable's appropriate for which use.\n\n1780\n01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:26,690\nKnow when to use one versus another.\n\n1781\n01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:30,090\nAll right, well,\nlet me just remind you guys,\n\n1782\n01:31:30,090 -->

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,745\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening, and\n\n6\n00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,851\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITPRO TV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,700\nI'm your host Don Posset,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,650\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,790\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,520\nWe are in the middle taking\na look at IT fundamentals and\n\n11\n00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,640\nwe're now moving from the outside\nto the inside the computer, and\n\n12\n00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,120\ntaking a look at the fun\nstuff inside the case.\n\n13\n00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,740\n>> That's right, if you are following\nalong in you're exam objectives we\n\n14\n00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,030\nare tackling exam objective 2.3.\n\n15\n00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,410\nIdentify the purpose of\ninternal computer components.\n\n16\n00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,320\nIn previous episodes, we've talked about\nall the stuff we hook up to the outside.\n\n17\n00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,230\nWhat about all the stuff on the inside?\n\n18\n00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,590\nYour average computer user is\nnever gonna worry about that.\n\n19\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,230\nThey're never gonna open up their case but\nIf you're gonna get into an IT career,\n\n20\n00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,490\nthis is where troubleshooting\nwill lend you.\n\n21\n00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,670\nNot just troubleshooting, but also you\nmight choose to upgrade a computer.\n\n22\n00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,530\nSo, we need to know what each of\nthe components are inside of it and\n\n23\n00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,820\nwhat they do.\n\n24\n00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,000\nWell, the best way to do that is to\ntake a look inside of a computer.\n\n25\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,300\nSo, right here on our podium,\nwe actually have a guest host with us,\n\n26\n00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,630\nwhich is a Dell computer, a Dell,\nwhat is this, an OptiPlex 980 or-\n\n27\n00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,470\n>> It is a 960.\n\n28\n00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,000\n>> OptiPlex nine something.\n\n29\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,950\nSo it's a [LAUGH], it's a Dell computer\nand it's pretty representative of your\n\n30\n00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,560\naverage tower-based computer,\nlike what you have at a desk.\n\n31\n00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,340\nLaptops are gonna be far different and\n\n32\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,830\nlaptops are usually very specialized\nbecause of how small they are.\n\n33\n00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,380\nBut desktops are typically\narranged the same and\n\n34\n00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,050\nthis one's a really good\nkind of general model.\n\n35\n00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,800\nSo, we're gonna rip this thing open and\n\n36\n00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,610\ntake a look at the components inside and\nhighlight their purpose.\n\n37\n00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,130\nSo, Ronnie,\nwhy don't you get this guy opened.\n\n38\n00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,770\n>> All right.\n\n39\n00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,900\n>> And we'll start to take a look inside.\n\n40\n00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,740\nAnd while you're doing that, I'm gonna\nstart talking about our first component.\n\n41\n00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,560\nThe first component I wanna talk about\nis the CPU, the central processing unit.\n\n42\n00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,320\nNow, a lot of people are in the habit\nof referring to this entire tower\n\n43\n00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,230\nas the CPU and that's not really true.\n\n44\n00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,950\nThe CPU's actually a very,\nvery small piece of it.\n\n45\n00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,090\nIt is the brain of your computer.\n\n46\n00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,090\nThe CPU is what does the thinking.\n\n47\n00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,400\nWhen there's a mathematical question,\nit gets thrown to the CPU and\n\n48\n00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,300\nthe CPU finds the answer and\nreturns it back.\n\n49\n00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,460\nSo, everything your computer does is\nreally being controlled by that processor.\n\n50\n00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,300\nSo, when we open up the computer,\neven though the CPU is a very,\n\n51\n00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,500\nvery small piece,\nit's the most important, and here we go.\n\n52\n00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,550\nSo, Ronnie,\nyou got this thing ripped open.\n\n53\n00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,750\nAnd the CPU that I'm talking about,\nthat's this guy, right here,\n\n54\n00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,570\nthis chip right here on my motherboard.\n\n55\n00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,920\nNow, before we get too far into this,\n\n56\n00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,970\nlet's start with just a little\nsomething not on the objectives,\n\n57\n00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,400\nwhich is electrical safety when\nworking with computers, all right.\n\n58\n00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,790\nIf you want to do this at home,\nthere's two things we need to remember.\n\n59\n00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,610\nFirst off, the computer should be\nturned off any time you open it.\n\n60\n00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,080\nIt's an electrical device,\nyou could shock yourself and I've done it,\n\n61\n00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,010\nit doesn't feel very good, so.\n\n62\n00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,950\nSome people might be into that,\nbut I'm not.\n\n63\n00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,530\nSo, you don't want to shock\nyourself if you don't have to.\n\n64\n00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,340\nSecondly, whether you know it or not.\n\n65\n00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,420\nYou have static electricity\nbuilt up in your system.\n\n66\n00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,120\nJust walking around on carpet or\neven the weather.\n\n67\n00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,750\nCertain barometric temperatures, or\n\n68\n00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,350\npressures can create static\nelectricity in the human body.\n\n69\n00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,720\nIt's just, it's there, and you really\nknow it, like in the winter time.\n\n70\n00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,810\nIf you rub your feet and\nyou walk up and you touch somebody and\n\n71\n00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,770\nzap them or, rubber balloon in your\nhair and then it will stick to the wall.\n\n72\n00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,720\nBut in a computer, it doesn't take\nvery much static electricity to\n\n73\n00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,650\ndamage an electrical component.\n\n74\n00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,180\nSo, when you're working on a computer like\nthis, you should always be grounded, and\n\n75\n00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,120\nthere's a number of ways to do that.\n\n76\n00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,130\nThere are elecro-static wristbands\nthat you can wear to ground yourself.\n\n77\n00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,260\nThere are metal tables and\ntables that have grounding in it.\n\n78\n00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,780\nLike ours,\n\n79\n00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,800\nwe've got this giant metal band around it\nhere that helps to ground out our system.\n\n80\n00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,670\nYou've also got things like ankle straps,\nall sorts of different tools that\n\n81\n00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,030\nare available, and, for those of you that\ngo on to work on the A+ certification,\n\n82\n00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,150\nwe cover those in much\nmore greater depth there.\n\n83\n00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,690\nIf you take your computer apart at home,\nthough, definitely be aware of that.\n\n84\n00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,430\nYou don't want to ruin a component just\nbecause you weren't properly grounded.\n\n85\n00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,040\nAll right, so that CPU,\n\n86\n00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,550\nthat little processor right down there\non the mother board, it is a micro chip,\n\n87\n00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,830\nand it doesn't look very micro,\nit's actually kind of a decent size.\n\n88\n00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,430\nBut it's small compared to everything\nelse that's inside of the case.\n\n89\n00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,070\nAll right.\n\n90\n00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,030\nRonnie, do you wanna pop\nthat out of it's socket?\n\n91\n00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,150\n>> Sure.\n\n92\n00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,930\n>> When you look at a CPU,\nif you were to flip it over,\n\n93\n00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,250\nthe top of it is actually just very\n>> Flat, there's not much to it.\n\n94\n00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,360\nWhen you flip it over,\nthere's actually hundreds of little\n\n95\n00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,460\npins underneath it that connect in with\nthe motherboard, and they're very fragile.\n\n96\n00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,990\nSo, we have to be careful with that.\n\n97\n00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,920\nWe don't want to break any of the pins.\n\n98\n00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,160\nThere is no way to repair\na broken pin on a CPU.\n\n99\n00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,330\nIf we damage it, it's just damaged, and\n\n100\n00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,800\nthat's it, so\nYou have to be careful with this.\n\n101\n00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,970\nNow, in our case, we can see that CPU\nis right there on the motherboard.\n\n102\n00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,700\nWe're gonna take a closer look\nat it a little bit later.\n\n103\n00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,460\nOn your computer,\n\n104\n00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,770\nwhen you open it up, you might not\nbe able to see the CPU right away.\n\n105\n00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,145\nA lot of times they will have a metal\nshroud on top of them called a heatsink,\n\n106\n00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:32,645\nand possibly even a fan sitting on top,\nall to dissipate heat.\n\n107\n00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:37,245\nModern CPUs generate a lot of heat, and\nit's gotta be pushed out of the case,\n\n108\n00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,975\notherwise your system will overheat.\n\n109\n00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:43,005\nWe took it off before this show because\nwe didn't want to block the view.\n\n110\n00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,445\nIf you can't see anything\nhow do you learn?\n\n111\n00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,020\nNow, the other general components inside\nof the case all start to build to what\n\n112\n00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,210\nthe computer does.\n\n113\n00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,640\nYou'll notice this gigantic circuit here.\n\n114\n00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,440\nThat's our motherboard, and\nwe're gonna take a close look at it in\n\n115\n00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,680\nanother segment, because I wanna\nget that out of the case here so\n\n116\n00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,550\nwe can take a really close look at it.\n\n117\n00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,400\nBut before we get to that, some of the\nother major components that you'll notice\n\n118\n00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,262\nwe got our power supply up here.\n\n119\n00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:11,060\nAll right, this is what's providing\npower to your entire computer.\n\n120\n00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,650\nIf it gets damage there are not\n\n121\n00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,180\nfield repairable Parts inside of this,\nall right?\n\n122\n00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,270\nThere are capacitors in\nthere that hold a charge,\n\n123\n00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,890\nand you can really hurt yourself pretty\nbadly if you take this thing apart.\n\n124\n00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,230\nSo, power supplies\nare always self-contained.\n\n125\n00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,860\nThey're always closed off like this,\nand if you take it out,\n\n126\n00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,710\nit's just the whole box that comes out,\nand you replace it with a new one.\n\n127\n00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,660\nYou do not service those unless\nyou are a trained electrician.\n\n128\n00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,240\nAll right.\nBut\n\n129\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,200\nyou'll notice there's a lot of\ncables that come out of it and\n\n130\n00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,320\nthese run to our motherboard,\nour hard drives, our optical drives,\n\n131\n00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,980\nall the various components in\nthe computer to provide power.\n\n132\n00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,610\nUp here we have some drives.\n\n133\n00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,430\nThese will usually be CD drives.\n\n134\n00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,570\nSo, if you have a CD, DVD, disc writer\nreader, they're mounted up here, and\n\n135\n00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,120\nthey just kinda go into this little cage\nbeing held up away from the other systems.\n\n136\n00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,460\nDown here we've got hard drives.\n\n137\n00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,570\nThis computer happens to\nhave two hard drives and so\n\n138\n00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,800\nthey're right down here,\nkind of off to the side.\n\n139\n00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,440\nYour computer may have\nthem arranged differently.\n\n140\n00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,320\nThey may be in different places.\n\n141\n00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,010\nYou'll likely only have one hard drive.\n\n142\n00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,980\nThis computer just happens to have two,\nbut\n\n143\n00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,710\na lot of systems only have one hard drive.\n\n144\n00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,360\nBut, often times you'll have an extra\nroom to add more if you want, and\n\n145\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,080\nthen this big thing right here,\nthis is actually a gigantic fan.\n\n146\n00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,940\nThe fan is sucking air in from\nthe front of the case and\n\n147\n00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,590\nblowing it over the motherboard to help\nkeep it cool and we can't see it here but\n\n148\n00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,320\nthere's vents all along the back side of\nthis case for the air to then go out.\n\n149\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,770\nSo, air is constantly blowing through\nthis device to keep it from overheating.\n\n150\n00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,970\nThat's what's going on\ninside of your case.\n\n151\n00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,070\nNow, I guarantee you if you open your case\nright now it's going to look different.\n\n152\n00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,930\nVendors arrange their\nequipment differently, and\n\n153\n00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,245\nalso we've removed all\nthe cabling that's normally here.\n\n154\n00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,177\nThese hard drives normally have power and\n\n155\n00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,721\nSATA cables that are running\nback to the motherboard.\n\n156\n00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:58,752\nOur CD drive up here has cables that\nare running back to the motherboard.\n\n157\n00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:02,229\nAll these power cables So, there will be a\nlot of cables that make it hard to see and\n\n158\n00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,889\nthat's what you normally see when\nyou open up a computer is a,\n\n159\n00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:05,930\na giant nest of cables.\n\n160\n00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:11,430\nAll right, well, we want to talk\nabout the components individually and\n\n161\n00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,990\nto do that best we really need to get the,\nthe motherboard out and\n\n162\n00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,060\ncomponents out where we can\ntake a closer look at them.\n\n163\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,380\nSo, let's take a quick timeout.\n\n164\n00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,130\nWe're gonna get that\nmotherboard out of the case and\n\n165\n00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,830\nthen we'll start walking\nthrough those pieces.\n\n166\n00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,180\nSo bear with us.\n\n167\n00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,345\nWe'll be back in just a second.\n\n168\n00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:30,055\n[SOUND]\n\n169\n00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:34,310\n[MUSIC]\n\n170\n00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,873\nAll right.\n\n171\n00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,380\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n172\n00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,130\nSo, during our quick little intermission,\n\n173\n00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,100\nthere we ripped the motherboard out of\nthat computer, and now we're going to take\n\n174\n00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,670\na close look at those components\nthat we mentioned a moment ago.\n\n175\n00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,570\nNow, I started off by talking about\nthe CPU, that brain of your computer.\n\n176\n00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,930\nThe CPU is plugged into a large circuit\nboard which is called your motherboard,\n\n177\n00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,250\nand where your,\nyour CPU is like the brain,\n\n178\n00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,460\nthe motherboard is like the nervous\nsystem of your computer.\n\n179\n00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,440\nIt's sending signals between\nall the different devices.\n\n180\n00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,095\nWhen any two devices wanna talk\nto each other, they go through.\n\n181\n00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:10,105\nThrough the motherboard, it's kind\nof connecting everything together.\n\n182\n00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,335\nThe motherboard itself\ndoesn't make decisions,\n\n183\n00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,235\nit just lets two people talk, and\n\n184\n00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:18,875\nit leaves the decisions up to other people\nwhich in most cases is the processor.\n\n185\n00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,925\nAll right, now Rodney you had pulled\nthat processor out a moment ago,\n\n186\n00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:24,985\nlet's take a look at that and\nI mentioned that we got various\n\n187\n00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:29,220\npins that are attached to it, that all tap\ninto the motherboard But that's our CPU.\n\n188\n00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,990\nNow, why don't you tell us a little bit\nabout the socket that it goes into?\n\n189\n00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,710\n>> The socket that it goes into,\nof course, is just a place for\n\n190\n00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,760\nit to directly connect to the motherboard,\nand\n\n191\n00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,320\nyou can see that there's a lot of tiny,\nlittle pins that are actually in here.\n\n192\n00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,690\nNow, this is a special type of CPU, in\nwhich there's pins on the socket instead.\n\n193\n00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,380\nAnd what we see over here on the CPU,\nthese kind of little nubs,\n\n194\n00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,130\nI guess is the best way to describe them.\n\n195\n00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,350\nAnd so it gives us a place to be able to\nlock it down so that the CPU doesn't move\n\n196\n00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,460\nwhile it's on the board, and\nmakes contact in every place.\n\n197\n00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,480\nWith this one,\nit locks down around the edge of it, and\n\n198\n00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,660\nthen we have a locking mechanism\nthat holds it in place.\n\n199\n00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,280\nSo, that even heat expansion and\n\n200\n00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,440\neverything else is still gonna end up\nbeing in the same place so, of course,\n\n201\n00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,080\nthere, on this CPU, there are millions\nof different transistors on it that\n\n202\n00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,095\nallow you to make millions\nof decisions very rapidly.\n\n203\n00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:26,195\n>> And those transistors,\nthey're called micro transistors.\n\n204\n00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,815\nYou, you really can't see\nthem with the human eye,\n\n205\n00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:31,805\nit requires a microscope to look at them,\nand if, if you think about how sm,\n\n206\n00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,425\nhow big that chip is in Ronnie's finge,\n\n207\n00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,725\nRonnie doesn't have like, tiny hands\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,975\n>> And this processor is actually\n\n209\n00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:37,612\nreally big.\n\n210\n00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:42,450\nYou know, that's a, a, a A very small chip\nand have millions of anything in there,\n\n211\n00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,200\nthey're obviously very, very small.\n\n212\n00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,340\nAnd that's what a CPU does,\nit's all in there.\n\n213\n00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,810\nI didn't realize this\none didn't have pins.\n\n214\n00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,140\nMany processors have pins that\nyou have to be careful with.\n\n215\n00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,030\nThis one doesn't,\n\n216\n00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,110\nit has little pads and the pads, you\nhave a pressure plate that applies them,\n\n217\n00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,590\nso different types of processors that are\nout there, and so you'll see variations.\n\n218\n00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,410\nMost of your CPUs are gonna\ncome from one of two companies.\n\n219\n00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,640\nThere's Intel,\nwho generates most of the CPUs for\n\n220\n00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920\ncomputers throughout the world,\nand there's AMD.\n\n221\n00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,880\nAMD is a competitor That\nmakes compatible processors.\n\n222\n00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,830\nAnd you'll find them in\nmany computers too, but\n\n223\n00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,100\nIntel's definitely got\nthe market share on that one.\n\n224\n00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,600\n>> Yeah,\na lot of times on these processors,\n\n225\n00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,160\nyou can actually see it actually written\non the top of the processor itself.\n\n226\n00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,340\nThis one, I've kinda rubbed it off I\n\n227\n00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,058\nthink whatever\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n228\n00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,493\n>> But you can barely see where it\n\n229\n00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,473\nactually once was.\n\n230\n00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:36,230\nIf I hold it right there.\n\n231\n00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,390\nBut this one's actually\nan Intel processor.\n\n232\n00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,300\n>> Now, a lot of times they laser etch\nit on there and with the processor,\n\n233\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,200\nwe normally have other things\non top of it to dissipate heat.\n\n234\n00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,290\nAnd there's a little grease they put\non there to fill in the gaps, and\n\n235\n00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,530\nit makes that writing\nNear impossible to see.\n\n236\n00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,040\nAnd they don't want to create deep\ngrooves because it messes with the heat\n\n237\n00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,810\ndissipation so it's oftentimes\nimpossible to read those things.\n\n238\n00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360\nAll right, the next one that\ncalls out is the power supply.\n\n239\n00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760\nAnd the power supply for\nus is still in the case.\n\n240\n00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,360\nAnd we saw that a moment ago,\nthat silver box,\n\n241\n00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,580\nand there's not much To see inside of it.\n\n242\n00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,790\nIt's what our power cable plugs into.\n\n243\n00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,180\nNow, the power supply runs the various\ndevices in your computer and so on,\n\n244\n00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,460\nyour motherboard you'll actually have a\nconnector where that power supply runs to.\n\n245\n00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,210\nAnd looking at the motherboard\nthat we've got here,\n\n246\n00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,260\nthat's this big long connector here.\n\n247\n00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,820\nYou'll see theres tons of different pins.\n\n248\n00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,060\nNow why is that?\n\n249\n00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,590\nWell you computer actually uses more than\n1 different level of voltage throughout\n\n250\n00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,620\nthe system.\n\n251\n00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,090\nSo, the components you use are either\ngoing to be running at five volts or\n\n252\n00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,880\n12 volts.\n\n253\n00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,520\nAnd so, the power supply has to send\ndifferent voltages into mother board so\n\n254\n00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,050\nthey can have access to that.\n\n255\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,700\nThe other thing is, there's certain\ncomponents on the motherboard that don't\n\n256\n00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,250\nplay nicely when you chain them together.\n\n257\n00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,620\nAnd so it has separate channels for\ncertain devices.\n\n258\n00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,290\nSome things like the CPU will have its own\n\n259\n00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,040\ndedicated cables that run\nback to the power supply,\n\n260\n00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,690\nversus other devices that share through\nthe power bus in the motherboard.\n\n261\n00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,330\n>> Yeah, so what Don was just\nmentioning about the CPU,\n\n262\n00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,750\nyou can see right over here, there's\nan extra four-pin connector over here.\n\n263\n00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,120\nThat would actually be helping\nto supply that for our CPU.\n\n264\n00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,240\n>> Yeah, and in older CPUs,\nand I'm talking really old,\n\n265\n00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,830\nlike Pentium three's and\nearlier, didn't have that.\n\n266\n00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,480\nStarting with the Pentium four's, which\nwould be, what would that be, Ronnie,\n\n267\n00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,260\nlike 2003 or something?\n\n268\n00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,950\n>> Yeah.\n2001 to 2003.\n\n269\n00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,150\n>> Right around there, that's when you\nstarted seeing this extra power connector\n\n270\n00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,190\ncoming, because the newer CPU's just\nrequire more power, cleaner power, and so\n\n271\n00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,690\nthey started adding a little more to it.\n\n272\n00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,820\nAll right, some of the other things\nwe're going to see: I said the CPU was\n\n273\n00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,950\nthe most important piece in your computer.\n\n274\n00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,230\nThat's what's making the decisions;\nthat's absolutely true.\n\n275\n00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,190\nWithout your CPU,\nyour computer won't even turn on.\n\n276\n00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,470\nYou'll push the power button,\nand nothing will happen.\n\n277\n00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,590\nThe second most important part inside of\nyour computer is what's called the RAM.\n\n278\n00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,120\nRAM is random access memory.\n\n279\n00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,700\nAnd we can see it on this mother\nboard up here at the top.\n\n280\n00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,730\nIt's these microchips that\nare inserted in slots.\n\n281\n00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,450\nRonnie, do you want to\npop one of those out.\n\n282\n00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,700\nRAM is where your computer\nstores things temporarily.\n\n283\n00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100\nSo when I tell the computer,\nhey I've got a math problem for you,\n\n284\n00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,253\nwhats two plus two?\n\n285\n00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:14,460\nAll right, well, it's gotta store\nthat math problem somewhere and\n\n286\n00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,580\nit gets the answer and\n\n287\n00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,050\nit's got to store the answer somewhere,\nand it's doing all that in RAM.\n\n288\n00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,850\nRAM is very, very fast.\n\n289\n00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,930\nThis is the fastest memory\ninside of your computer.\n\n290\n00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,370\nSo when you write to it,\n\n291\n00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,030\nyou can write very quickly and\nwhen you read you can read very quickly.\n\n292\n00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,730\nBut RAM is expensive, so\nyou don't have a ton of it.\n\n293\n00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,450\nThat's why on our system we'll normally\nhave additional types of memory to\n\n294\n00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,650\nsupplement that.\n\n295\n00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,860\nSo, that's where our hard drives,\nour CD drives, and those things come in.\n\n296\n00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,300\nThey're far less expensive than RAM,\nbut they're a lot slower.\n\n297\n00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,270\nSo when we're trying to perform any kind\nof fast operation, we copy our data into\n\n298\n00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,770\nRAM, and we work with it there,\nwhere it's really nice and fast.\n\n299\n00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,500\nNow there's many different kinds\nof RAM chips that are out there.\n\n300\n00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,290\nAnd you don't need about that for\nthis exam.\n\n301\n00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,910\nFor those of you that go on to A+, you'll\nhave to know all the different types.\n\n302\n00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,990\nBut one thing to remember about memory,\nis there are different types.\n\n303\n00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,810\nAnd so they put these little notches\nin the key, in, in the pins,\n\n304\n00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,810\nthey call that a key, so that memory is\nkeyed to the mother board, and if you look\n\n305\n00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,480\nat the slot over here, there's a,\nI guess we can't really see that can we?\n\n306\n00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,250\nOh there it is.\n\n307\n00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,730\nYou can see the little notch.\n\n308\n00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,220\nThat's in that memory bank\nright there in the middle.\n\n309\n00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,650\nSo if I try and put a memory stick in here\nand that notch isn't in the right place,\n\n310\n00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,330\nit won't go in.\n\n311\n00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,880\nThat stops you from using\nthe wrong memory in a computer.\n\n312\n00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,460\nBut t also means you could buy the wring\nmemory and that it just won't even fit and\n\n313\n00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,670\nit won't work.\n\n314\n00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,570\nSo not all memory is\ncompatible with all computers.\n\n315\n00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,010\nYou've got to verify that before\nyou go and purchase new RAM.\n\n316\n00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,550\nYeah.\n\n317\n00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,020\nThe other nice thing about that notch is,\n\n318\n00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,615\nit makes sure that you can't\nput it in backwards either.\n\n319\n00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,839\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now I say that.\n\n320\n00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,161\nI guess you could try and force it in, but\nusually if you do, one side will fit but\n\n321\n00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,540\nthe other side wont and\nthat normally lets you know that,\n\n322\n00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,542\nthat you're not gonna be\nable to put it back in.\n\n323\n00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:59,603\nThe way that you think it's gonna go in so\nyou flip it over, it will be fine.\n\n324\n00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:03,030\n>> Now this particular computer\nhas four slots for memory.\n\n325\n00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,012\nSo we can have up to four chips and\nyou'll see we've got a full,\n\n326\n00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,150\nwhat size is that chip?\n\n327\n00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,620\n>> These are,\non the sticker it says 2 gigabytes.\n\n328\n00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,810\n>> Okay, so we've got 4,\n2 gigabyte sticks in here.\n\n329\n00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,600\nNow this memory adds up to 8\ngigabytes of memory total.\n\n330\n00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,290\nWhat if I wanted to\nupgrade to 16 gigabytes?\n\n331\n00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,590\nWell, it's full.\n\n332\n00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,250\nSo I'm gonna have to replace\nsome of these chips.\n\n333\n00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,270\nI'll have to take some out and\nreplace them.\n\n334\n00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,490\nIn your computer,\nyou might have some empty slots.\n\n335\n00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,040\nAnd so you can add memory to it.\n\n336\n00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,150\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,670\nYou can mix and match memory.\n\n338\n00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,960\nThere are some computers that\nrequire you to do it in pairs, so\n\n339\n00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,110\nif you install new memory,\nyou've gotta do that.\n\n340\n00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,810\nAnd you'll see this\ncomputer is one of those,\n\n341\n00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:44,110\nwhere if we were to pop all the memory\nout, you'll notice how some of\n\n342\n00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,990\nthe slots have black levers on the side,\nand some have white levers.\n\n343\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,280\nAnd those are the paired-up slots.\n\n344\n00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,290\nIf I add just two sticks of memory to this\ncomputer, so I'm just going to do two.\n\n345\n00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,070\nWell, that's fine but I need to put\nthem both in the white slots, right?\n\n346\n00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,850\nBecause they're labeled,\nit's really hard to see, but\n\n347\n00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,370\non the motherboard it's saying whether\nthey're chip number 1, 2, 3 or 4.\n\n348\n00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,095\nAnd so\nwe would put them in the white ones first.\n\n349\n00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:14,925\nAnd then when we went to four sticks,\nwe'd put them in the black ones also.\n\n350\n00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:18,540\nBut I might have 1 gig sticks\nin the white ports, and\n\n351\n00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,375\n2 gig sticks in the black ports.\n\n352\n00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,270\nAnd that would give me 6 gigs of memory\ntotal or we could do what we did which is\n\n353\n00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,670\njust add the same memory in\nall four ports to fill it up.\n\n354\n00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,800\nYour computer might not have four ports,\nit might only have two ports,\n\n355\n00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,170\nit might only have one port on\nthe motherboard for memory.\n\n356\n00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,070\nIt varies from vendor to vendor\nwhen they build your computer.\n\n357\n00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,340\nThe less expensive your computer is,\n\n358\n00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,250\nthe less slots you're going\nto have on that motherboard.\n\n359\n00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,370\nYou know, if you get a super dirt cheap\nsystem, often times it will only have one\n\n360\n00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,270\nRAM slot and it will have one\nstick in there and that's it.\n\n361\n00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,490\nAnd you can't expand it.\n\n362\n00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,480\n>> Yeah.\nAnd some motherboards will tell you what\n\n363\n00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,070\nlimitation is, if you decide to build your\nown computer and go, I wanna get this\n\n364\n00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,235\nmother board, it may tell you maximum\namount of memory it can address.\n\n365\n00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:03,770\n8 gigs, or 16 or 24 or\nwhatever it might be, or 32 normally.\n\n366\n00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,450\n>> Yeah.\n>> not 24.\n\n367\n00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,160\n>> There's always a limit and\nyou need to look at the manual for\n\n368\n00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,750\nyour motherboard to find out.\n\n369\n00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,770\nIf you bought a computer from\na vendor like Dell or HP, they\n\n370\n00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,590\nusually won't give you a manual just for\nthe motherboard, you'll have a manual for\n\n371\n00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,660\nthe whole computer and\nthe maximum limits will be in there.\n\n372\n00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,070\nBut if you built your computer yourself,\nyou'll have the manual for\n\n373\n00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,930\nthe motherboard itself.\n\n374\n00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,110\nAnd it'll say what that maximum is.\n\n375\n00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,310\nIt'll also tell you whether\nyou have to do it paired or\n\n376\n00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,910\nwhether you can do single sticks\nwhether you can mix and match.\n\n377\n00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,340\nAll the limitations\nwill be in that manual.\n\n378\n00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,680\nAll right so CPU and memory.\n\n379\n00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,010\nThose two guys are really important.\n\n380\n00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,210\nAs long as you have those two components,\nyou can actually boot your computer and\n\n381\n00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,020\nat least do some basic stuff.\n\n382\n00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,940\nSo those are the really\ncritical components.\n\n383\n00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,740\nBut it's not normally go to\ngive enough to make us happy.\n\n384\n00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,370\nThere's a problem with RAM.\n\n385\n00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:55,450\nRAM is very fast, but if you cut power\nto it, it erases itself, it empties.\n\n386\n00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,840\nSo, RAM requires electricity\nto save data in it.\n\n387\n00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400\nSo, every time you shut your\ncomputer down, RAM gets erased.\n\n388\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,877\nSo, if you just wrote a term paper, or\nsome kind of document, and it's in RAM and\n\n389\n00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,240\nyou shut your computer off, it's gone!\n\n390\n00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,150\nSo, we need to be able\nto save that somewhere\n\n391\n00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,760\nwhere it'll still be there when\nwe fire the computer back up.\n\n392\n00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,250\nSo we need some kind of\na reliable storage that,\n\n393\n00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,860\nthat'll be there and that's where\nour other devices are gonna come in.\n\n394\n00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,810\nAnd Comptia calls out three in particular.\n\n395\n00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,210\nThe first one they call is\nan optical drive, all right?\n\n396\n00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,910\nAn optical drive, that's normally\ngoing to be like a CD or a DVD drive.\n\n397\n00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,490\nAll right, and Ronnie's going to\nrip the one out of this computer.\n\n398\n00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,700\nI shouldn't say ripping out\nwith a crow bar or anything.\n\n399\n00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,490\nSo he's gonna take the one out of there.\n\n400\n00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,520\nMost systems do have a CD or\nDVD drive because it's useful for\n\n401\n00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,160\ninstalling software, right.\n\n402\n00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,880\nWith these, they're nice to have because\nyou get your installation media,\n\n403\n00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,750\nyou pop them in there, you can watch\nmovies on them, various things on them,\n\n404\n00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,000\nso it is nice to have.\n\n405\n00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,310\nBut there's some negatives.\n\n406\n00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,710\nThey're not particularly fast.\n\n407\n00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,320\nSo, reading data off of\nthese disks is not fast.\n\n408\n00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,570\nWriting data, if you have a read-write,\nso this one it says\n\n409\n00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,400\nRW right there which actually tells me\nthis is a DVD burner, not just a reader.\n\n410\n00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,550\nSo we can actually write our own DVDs,\nthe writing process for\n\n411\n00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,970\nthis is very, very slow.\n\n412\n00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,620\nYou also can typically only write once.\n\n413\n00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,940\nSometimes, you have rewritable DVDs or\nrewritable CDs but\n\n414\n00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,830\nthey're not very common.\n\n415\n00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,140\nSo normally, you write once,\nand that's it.\n\n416\n00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,710\nSo if you're writing a term paper and\nyou save to a DVD, and\n\n417\n00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,100\nthen you wanna make some changes,\nyou gotta burn to an all new DVD, right?\n\n418\n00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,770\nSo it, it's not really viable for our\ntypical storage, but if you have a movie,\n\n419\n00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,150\nif you have installation software,\nwhatever, CDs work great for that.\n\n420\n00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,560\nA lot of newer computers\nare not coming with CDs.\n\n421\n00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,410\nBecause we download our software off the\ninternet, we use the cloud to store our\n\n422\n00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,530\ndata and we have less and\nless need for physical CDs like that.\n\n423\n00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,190\nSo instead,\nwe're going to use hard drives.\n\n424\n00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,590\nHard drives have been the primary\nstorage for computers for\n\n425\n00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,040\nover 20 years now and they are,\nthey basically work as, as magnetic media.\n\n426\n00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,770\nThere's a little arm in there that's\nwriting little electrical charges to\n\n427\n00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,950\na platter, and the electrical\ncharges basically equal 0s and 1s.\n\n428\n00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,790\nSo all of your data is being\nwritten to the hard drive and\n\n429\n00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,920\nit sits there waiting for you.\n\n430\n00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,380\nUnlike RAM,\nif you cut the power off to a hard drive,\n\n431\n00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,200\nit saves everything that's on there.\n\n432\n00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,350\nSo Ronnie took this hard drive out,\nit's got no power,\n\n433\n00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,590\nit's not hooked up, but all the data\non it is completely safe and sound, and\n\n434\n00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,580\nit'll still be there when we\npower the computer back on.\n\n435\n00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,060\nNow Ronnie, how big is that hard drive?\n\n436\n00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,210\n>> This one says 160 gigabytes.\n\n437\n00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,126\n>> All right.\n160 gig,\n\n438\n00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,040\nthat's pretty small by today's standard.\n\n439\n00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,887\n160 gigabytes, well,\n\n440\n00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:38,320\n1 terabyte drives are 1,000 gigabyte\ndrives are pretty common now.\n\n441\n00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,790\nAnd that's what, five,\nsix times the size of this drive.\n\n442\n00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,220\nSo it's a pretty small 1.\n\n443\n00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,920\nComputers come with different sizes.\n\n444\n00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,620\nAnd it's just gonna determine how much\ndata you can store on that drive.\n\n445\n00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,880\nFortunately, if you fill it up,\n\n446\n00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,360\nit's pretty easy to swap\nit out with a larger one.\n\n447\n00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,900\nHard drives all conform to\nthe same standards and so\n\n448\n00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,460\nit's not hard to find a replacement\ndrive for your system.\n\n449\n00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,520\nThis one is a serial ATA drive.\n\n450\n00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,130\nSo if we look at its connectors, you'll\nsee that it's got a serial ATA connector\n\n451\n00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,120\nand a power connector next to it to,\nto feed it that power,\n\n452\n00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,420\nthose little copper leads\nthat we're seeing there.\n\n453\n00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,980\nAnd if you remember back from\nour cable connector episode,\n\n454\n00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,430\nthat SATA connector is what'll\nplug into an internal drive.\n\n455\n00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,390\nAnd then it'll run to a corresponding\nport on the motherboard.\n\n456\n00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,490\nNow this motherboard has several\ndifferent serial ATA connectors, and\n\n457\n00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,240\nI can see them labeled 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\n458\n00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,940\nAnd one of them is blue.\n\n459\n00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,800\nWhat the heck is that all about, Ronnie?\n\n460\n00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,410\n>> That blue one is the 0, which normally\nmeans if you only have one device\n\n461\n00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,970\nthat is the one that you wanna plug into.\n\n462\n00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,050\n>> Now that blue, that's something\nDell chose to do, it's not a standard,\n\n463\n00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,660\nwhen you look at yours, you might have\nall your ports the same color, right?\n\n464\n00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,230\nAnd it might be red, who knows?\n\n465\n00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,800\nIt could be anything, but\n\n466\n00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,390\nDell likes to identify that as that's the\none the original drive was plugged into,\n\n467\n00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,050\nbut there's four of them,\nso I can add more drives.\n\n468\n00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,870\nNow we had a CD drive in there also and\nthe CD drive would run one of these and\n\n469\n00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,570\nthat would leave two more empty.\n\n470\n00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,020\nWe actually had two hard drives, so\nthat means, if we have two hard drives and\n\n471\n00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,110\na CD drive, that's three of\nthe four ports, still one left.\n\n472\n00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,515\nSo, we can actually add another hard\ndrive or another CD drive if wanted to.\n\n473\n00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:15,025\nWe've got an extra port for it.\n\n474\n00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,815\nSome computers will also have\nadditional ports like an E-SATA,\n\n475\n00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,195\nthe external port on the back of it.\n\n476\n00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:21,305\nThis one does.\n\n477\n00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:23,520\nSo you might see some other ports there.\n\n478\n00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,570\nYou might have more than just four on\nyour motherboard or you might have less.\n\n479\n00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,730\nI know my old computer only\nhad two on the motherboard.\n\n480\n00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,270\nSo the amount of those ports can vary.\n\n481\n00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,450\nBut that's where our hard drives are going\nto attach to with those SATA cables\n\n482\n00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,510\nwe saw in the connector episode.\n\n483\n00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,750\nAll right now, hard drives,\nthey're magnetic media.\n\n484\n00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,160\nThey work with a spinning disk.\n\n485\n00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000\nAnd that means there's moving parts.\n\n486\n00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,078\nI know, wh, when Ronnie shows a hard drive\nthere, it just looks like a solid block,\n\n487\n00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:50,296\nthere's not much to it.\n\n488\n00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,025\nBut if we were to open it up.\n\n489\n00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,243\nWell, first of, that would ruin the disk,\nyou can't open these up.\n\n490\n00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:56,077\nIf we were to open it up.\n\n491\n00:23:56,077 --> 00:24:00,572\nYou would see these platters, these zinc\ncoated platters that are very shiny and\n\n492\n00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,400\npretty.\n\n493\n00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,740\nBut they're just in there and\nthey spin around like a record player,\n\n494\n00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,770\nor CD, or whatever.\n\n495\n00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,210\nThey spin very, very fast and\nthe arms move and read the data.\n\n496\n00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,830\n>> Yeah, you can see kinda the outline\nof the shape of that platter we're\n\n497\n00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,840\ntalking about.\n\n498\n00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840\nAlong with that spindle\nright there in the center.\n\n499\n00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,650\n>> The problem with that is\nit requires moving parts and\n\n500\n00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,600\nanytime you have moving\nparts it means slow.\n\n501\n00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,640\nIt means failure, right?\n\n502\n00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,000\nAny moving part, if it moves long enough\nwill wear out and the drive will fail.\n\n503\n00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,380\nSo your typical hard drive\nwill only last about 3 years.\n\n504\n00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,290\nMost vendors will not go beyond three\nyears with a warranty on the drive,\n\n505\n00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,310\nthat's pretty much what they expect.\n\n506\n00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,480\nYou may have a drive that's been running\nfor six years without a problem.\n\n507\n00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,410\nSomebody else might have a drive\ngoing around one year and\n\n508\n00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,300\nfailed, but three years is the average,\n\n509\n00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,350\nthat's usually what you're going to get\nout of a standard hard drive like that.\n\n510\n00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,440\nNow in terms of speed, remember how\nI mentioned RAM is really fast?\n\n511\n00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,900\nWe measure RAM speed in nanoseconds.\n\n512\n00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,465\nSo nanoseconds, that's one nanosecond\nis a thousandth of a second, but\n\n513\n00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:05,315\nwe measure hard drives in milliseconds,\nthat's a hundredth of a second.\n\n514\n00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:09,545\nAnd that means that a hard drive is,\nto use our scientific terminology,\n\n515\n00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:13,315\nit is an order of\nmagnitude slower than RAM.\n\n516\n00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:16,757\nRAM Is considerably faster\nthan a hard drive access.\n\n517\n00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:21,467\nAnd so typically we want our data that\nwe're working with right now to be in RAM.\n\n518\n00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,487\nFortunately, we don't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n519\n00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,257\nYour operating system takes care of it.\n\n520\n00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,347\nWhen you fire up a web browser,\n\n521\n00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,957\nthe web browser itself is\nstored on your hard drive.\n\n522\n00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:33,177\nBut it reads it from the hard drive and\ncopies it into RAM.\n\n523\n00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:37,390\nAnd so while you're in the web browser,\nit's actually running RAM.\n\n524\n00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,870\nAnd when you open up that word\nprocessor and you write a document,\n\n525\n00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,660\nit's running from RAM.\n\n526\n00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,410\nAnd when you hit save,\nit's saving to the hard drive, right?\n\n527\n00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,300\nThat's why we have to remember to save our\ndocuments while we work on them cuz if we\n\n528\n00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,040\nlose power,\neverything was in ram, it's gone.\n\n529\n00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,890\n>> Yeah, for storage devices more than\nlikely in today's world what you're gonna\n\n530\n00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,440\nsee is people want to actually go faster.\n\n531\n00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,280\nSo remember that every time we're\nwriting to the actual hard drive,\n\n532\n00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160\nwe're actually having to\nwrite on that platter,\n\n533\n00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,820\nwhich is now writing a copy\nof it on that moving disk.\n\n534\n00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,240\nSo today the faster drives are what\nwe also call the solid state drives.\n\n535\n00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,000\nIn the solid state drives there are no\nmoving parts everything is actually stored\n\n536\n00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,170\nelectronically on different\nchips inside of that drive.\n\n537\n00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,750\nAnd the form factors can vary,\n\n538\n00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,230\nthey can look about the standard size\nof a regular smaller hard drive.\n\n539\n00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,920\nSome of them actually look much smaller\nthan that which just looks like a regular\n\n540\n00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,620\nchip on a little circuit board itself too.\n\n541\n00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,510\nThese drives that we have that are solid\nstate, typically you don't see them in\n\n542\n00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,910\nthe capacities as large as\nkind of the terrabyte size.\n\n543\n00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,410\nUnless you go very expensive but a lot of\ntime you actually see they're comparable\n\n544\n00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,770\nto smaller solid, or\nto smaller conventional drives too.\n\n545\n00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,770\n>> SSD has bridged the gap between\ntraditional magnetic hard drives and RAM.\n\n546\n00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,220\nRAM is very fast because\nthey're microchips and\n\n547\n00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,270\nwhen you want to read from sector 212\nyou just go straight to sector 212.\n\n548\n00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,990\nOn a hard drive it's\ngotta spin the disk and\n\n549\n00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,940\nmove the head to get to sector 212, right?\n\n550\n00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,550\nIt's not gonna be that fast.\n\n551\n00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,750\nSolid state digital takes the advantage\nof being a microchip, being able to jump\n\n552\n00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,290\nright to where you wanna go, but\ncouples it with persistent memory.\n\n553\n00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,090\nAnd that means that if\nyou cut power to an SSD,\n\n554\n00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,320\nit still remembers what was written there.\n\n555\n00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,220\nIt's not as fast as ram but\nit's getting closer, right.\n\n556\n00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,030\nProblem is, just like ram, it's expensive,\nand until those prices normalize,\n\n557\n00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,680\nyou're still gonna see people selling\nmagnetic drives and solid state.\n\n558\n00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,940\nSo here I've pulled up a pretty\ncommon solid state drive.\n\n559\n00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,350\nHere's one that is just 250 gigs.\n\n560\n00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,460\nI mentioned that terabyte\ndrives are really common now,\n\n561\n00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,790\nthat's with magnetic drives.\n\n562\n00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,320\nYou can get a 1 terabytes\nmagnetic drive for $100 anywhere.\n\n563\n00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,200\nThat's an easy price point to hit,\nfull retail at the mom and\n\n564\n00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,250\npop stores right in your own town,\na 1 terabyte magnetic drive.\n\n565\n00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,550\nBut here I get a quarter of that,\na 250 gig drive,\n\n566\n00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,280\nwhich is one-fourth of a terabyte for\nabout $130.\n\n567\n00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,630\nThat's actually a pretty good price here.\n\n568\n00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,790\nIt's actually on sale, right.\n\n569\n00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n570\n00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,870\n>> We should get commission for\nsomething like this.\n\n571\n00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,520\n>> Yeah, and if you look over down to\nthe lower, yep, one terabyte, $426.\n\n572\n00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,700\n>> Yeah, so, quite a bit more\nexpensive than magnetic drives, but\n\n573\n00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,800\nyou're paying for performance.\n\n574\n00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,760\n>> You are.\n>> These are fast and\n\n575\n00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,900\na lot of new laptops are starting to\nship with solid state drives internally,\n\n576\n00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,600\nlike both of ours have it.\n\n577\n00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,870\nAnd once you've experienced it,\n\n578\n00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,390\nyou never wanna go back to\na regular magnetic drive again.\n\n579\n00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,820\nI mean, it makes a huge difference.\n\n580\n00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,500\nNow your computer doesn't really\ncare all that much that it's SSD.\n\n581\n00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,120\nIf you look at this thing in the picture,\nyou can actually see right there,\n\n582\n00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,280\nthere's the SATA connector and there's the\npower connector just like a regular drive.\n\n583\n00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,240\nSo in your computer you just drop it\nin the same spot that the regular drive\n\n584\n00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,290\nwould have gone, you hook up the same\ncables and now you run, super mega fast.\n\n585\n00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,410\nAll right, now your operating\nsystem will know that it's SSD.\n\n586\n00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,230\nThere's a little problem with SSD,\nwith a magnetic drive,\n\n587\n00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,960\nyou can write to the same place over and\nover and over again as much as you want.\n\n588\n00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600\nYou can add the electric charge, remove\nthe electric charge over and over and\n\n589\n00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,090\nover again it'll run.\n\n590\n00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,290\nOn a regular hard drive, it'll never have\na failure based on the magnetic writing.\n\n591\n00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,808\nIt'll have a failure based on\nthe mechanical parts failing,\n\n592\n00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:23,828\njust the movement.\n\n593\n00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:28,290\nBut on solid-state digital,\nwhen you're writing to that memory,\n\n594\n00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,770\nit has to be able to remember what was\nwritten even when it's powered off.\n\n595\n00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,790\nSo it actually makes a significant\nchange when it writes that data and\n\n596\n00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,375\nas a result the more you write to it,\nit's gonna wear out, and so\n\n597\n00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:45,710\nsolid-state digital drives\ndon't last as long.\n\n598\n00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,220\nIn fact with a regular\nmagnetic hard drive,\n\n599\n00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,220\nwe state three years is the average, but\nyou might go beyond that pretty far,\n\n600\n00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,370\njust without a failure, but with an SSD\nby the time you hit three years.\n\n601\n00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,850\nIt's more than likely time to replace\nit even if everything seems fine.\n\n602\n00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,310\nAnd that's because it's gonna start having\nlittle failures throughout the drive.\n\n603\n00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,310\nNow, most modern operating\nsystems recognize that and\n\n604\n00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,320\ninstead of always writing\nto the same place,\n\n605\n00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,240\nthey balance the writes all across the\nsurface of that disk to maximize the life.\n\n606\n00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,730\nSo you'll get three years pretty easy,\nno big deal even on a heavy use drive.\n\n607\n00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,514\nAnd I've seen some studies where people\nare shown, especially these Samsung,\n\n608\n00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:26,450\nthey actually go a long way that you can\nget millions upon millions of writes to\n\n609\n00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,170\nthe disk so don't worry too\nmuch about your drive failing.\n\n610\n00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,710\nBut just know after three years on\na SSD that clock is ticking and\n\n611\n00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,720\nit's ticking faster than it\nwould on a magnetic drive.\n\n612\n00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,768\nBut for three years,\nyou get some really good performance, so\n\n613\n00:30:40,768 --> 00:30:42,043\nremember the good times.\n\n614\n00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:42,622\n>> Yeah.\n>> As you.\n\n615\n00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:45,920\n>> Cuz you're not wanna go back,\nguarantee it.\n\n616\n00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,730\n>> And just get a new one.\n\n617\n00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,527\nSo if you're one of those people that\ngets a new computer every three years\n\n618\n00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:51,508\nanyway then who cares it doesn't matter.\n\n619\n00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:53,490\nBut if you're somebody who\nkeeps the computer for\n\n620\n00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,950\nas long as they can if you go\nSSD put it in your budget.\n\n621\n00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,590\nJust plan on having to replace\nthat a few years later.\n\n622\n00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,680\nAll right, so, those are solid state\ndrives, they're definitely great.\n\n623\n00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,110\nI like them myself, that's something\nI am definitely partial to.\n\n624\n00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,420\nAll right,\nwe've got some more stuff to talk about.\n\n625\n00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,920\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n626\n00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,750\nSo lets pause here for a breather.\n\n627\n00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,372\nWhen we get back, we've still got,\nwe got all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n628\n00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:20,067\nWe've got expansion cards and\nfans and all that good stuff.\n\n629\n00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,720\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n630\n00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,999\n[MUSIC]\n\n631\n00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,875\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n632\n00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,095\nSo now we're going to take\na look at add in cards.\n\n633\n00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:38,195\nAll right, now, what are add in cards or\nadd on cards or\n\n634\n00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,850\nwhatever you want to call them.\n\n635\n00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,050\n>> At the beginning, right,\n\n636\n00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,400\nmost motherboards will have the basic\nfunctionality that you need.\n\n637\n00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,617\nAnd that helps manufacturers\nkeep the costs low,\n\n638\n00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,324\nyou don't have to add in any\nadditional things to function.\n\n639\n00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:55,293\nSo, even with that,\nthe problem is you may want to have more.\n\n640\n00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:58,625\nYou may want to have better sound,\nbetter video quality.\n\n641\n00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,821\nBetter networking.\n\n642\n00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:01,144\nWhatever it might be.\n\n643\n00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:05,043\nAnd now, motherboard manufacturers\ngive you the ability,\n\n644\n00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:09,477\nat your cost and not at theirs,\nto be able to buy these special circuit\n\n645\n00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:14,940\nboards that can enhance your computing and\nmake it the way you want it to be.\n\n646\n00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,480\n>> Yeah, the add on boards,\nthey allow for two things.\n\n647\n00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,240\nThey allow for one,\ncustomers do customize their computers.\n\n648\n00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,160\nNo two customers are identical,\nand they can't make individualized\n\n649\n00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,100\ncomputers based on a person's needs,\nso they just make them flexible.\n\n650\n00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,920\nSo that's kind of part one.\n\n651\n00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,842\nThe other part is,\nit gives you a little more resiliency.\n\n652\n00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:36,830\nWhen everything is baked into\nthe motherboard, if something fails,\n\n653\n00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,360\nyou've got to replace\nthe whole motherboard.\n\n654\n00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,570\nBut if it's an add in card,\nyou can replace just the card.\n\n655\n00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,840\nSo it does give you a little\nmore flexibility there, too.\n\n656\n00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,940\nWhen you buy a computer today,\nif it's a desktop computer, a tower,\n\n657\n00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,420\nyou'll usually see a mixture of onboard\ncomponents and inserted components.\n\n658\n00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,950\nWhere we really see this are video cards.\n\n659\n00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,480\nCuz video cards can be\nincredibly expensive.\n\n660\n00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,190\nAnd so they'll normally put a super cheap\nvideo card built into the motherboard, and\n\n661\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,880\nthen if you're a gamer you can go out and\nbuy an insanely expensive video card and\n\n662\n00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,450\nstick it in there, if you want.\n\n663\n00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,470\nIt's up to you.\n\n664\n00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,210\nRight?\nThat's kind of\n\n665\n00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,560\nthe cool part of all of this.\n\n666\n00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,610\nNow we've been using a particular\nmotherboard here on the show and\n\n667\n00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,790\nit's got a ton of stuff built into it.\n\n668\n00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,660\nJust looking at the motherboard, we've\nseen some of the standard components, but\n\n669\n00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,790\nI'm gonna flip around\nthe backside here and\n\n670\n00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,670\nI can see that it's got\na network card built into it, so\n\n671\n00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:31,400\nright here I've got that network jack, the\nRJ-45 plug, I've got a bunch of USB ports.\n\n672\n00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,440\nI've got six USB ports right\nhere available for me.\n\n673\n00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,576\nI've got audio.\n\n674\n00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:36,580\nRight?\n\n675\n00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,690\nSo I've got a sound card that's\nbuilt into this motherboard so\n\n676\n00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,670\nit can generate all the sound that I need.\n\n677\n00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,520\nAnd we've got VGA right here.\n\n678\n00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,980\nSo it's got a video card\nbuilt into it with VGA out.\n\n679\n00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,310\nThe problem is,\nthis might not be enough for me.\n\n680\n00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,912\nAll right.\n\n681\n00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,570\nSo there's various things that\nwe might choose to add in and\n\n682\n00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,100\nthe first one,\nwe'll alternate through these around here.\n\n683\n00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,680\nBut the first one I want\nto tackle is video card.\n\n684\n00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,570\nWhen you get a new computer the onboard\nvideo cards are not terribly impressive.\n\n685\n00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,300\nSo if you are doing anything that requires\n3D rendering, you will likely go out and\n\n686\n00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,360\nbuy a new one, and if you've watched\nany of the shows that Nate and\n\n687\n00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,390\nI have done, we usually bicker in between\nthe segments about which is better.\n\n688\n00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,660\nHe's a big ATI guy.\n\n689\n00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,390\nI'm a big Nvidia guy, and\nit doesn't matter which one you are.\n\n690\n00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,720\nThey're both expensive and so it does\ncost a good bit to throw those in there.\n\n691\n00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,520\nSo when you buy your motherboard, even\nwith an onboard video port like this one,\n\n692\n00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,780\na lot of times we'll\nsee a PCI Express port.\n\n693\n00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,470\nThis big, long connector right here.\n\n694\n00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,290\nThat's a PCI Express port.\n\n695\n00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,750\nAnd it's designed for video cards.\n\n696\n00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,500\nRight?\nSo you can go out and buy a video card,\n\n697\n00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,190\nand throw it in there and some systems,\nthe even more advanced ones, might have\n\n698\n00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,370\ntwo of these and you can get two video\ncards and stick them in side by side and\n\n699\n00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:53,600\nthey'll work as a team and\nyou get like double the action, whatever,\n\n700\n00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,092\nsomething I don't know,\nI've never paid enough to do that.\n\n701\n00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:58,690\nBut [LAUGH] but\nyou can do that if you're hardcore.\n\n702\n00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,930\nBut you can go out and\nbuy a video card, something like this.\n\n703\n00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,160\nThis is not a high end one,\nthis is kind of a middle of the road one.\n\n704\n00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,540\nAnd a video card might have a dedicated\n\n705\n00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,510\nprocessor on it that's faster\nthan whatever is onboard.\n\n706\n00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,670\nIt might just have different connectors.\n\n707\n00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,190\nSee this one has a dual\nscreen DVI port on it,\n\n708\n00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,720\nso I can actually have two\nmonitors hooked up to this\n\n709\n00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,210\nDVI versus the one onboard that just gave\nme one VGA, this will give me two DVI.\n\n710\n00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,950\nSo it's an upgrade from what\nwas on the motherboard.\n\n711\n00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,490\nIf you just need one monitor,\nthe integrated card has you covered.\n\n712\n00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,850\nOne VGA, you run it through your\nmonitor and you're done, but\n\n713\n00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,390\nif you want to go multi-monitor,\nwe need the upgrade.\n\n714\n00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,790\nThis one also has another port\nthat I don't recognize so\n\n715\n00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,310\nI don't know what the heck that is.\n\n716\n00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,790\nSome vendors will put\na proprietary port on there,\n\n717\n00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,340\nand they'll have a cable that'll break out\nto component or some other one and that's\n\n718\n00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,740\nprobably what this is, but just looking\nat it, I have no idea what that port is.\n\n719\n00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,480\nIt's labeled S, but it's not S-video so\nwho knows what the heck it is.\n\n720\n00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,300\nBut you'll see that they can create their\nown proprietary junk, but you go out and\n\n721\n00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,190\nyou buy one of these cards and\nit fits right in that slot.\n\n722\n00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,350\nSo easy add on right there.\n\n723\n00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,085\nThis one is a middle of the road card.\n\n724\n00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:09,590\nThe middle of the road cards like\nthese just pop right into that slot.\n\n725\n00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,230\nAnd you are upgraded, if I can,\nthey do require a little bit of force.\n\n726\n00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,730\nI'm getting caught on\nthe safety lever there.\n\n727\n00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,250\nYou know what?\n\n728\n00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,605\nI'm actually just hitting the table.\n\n729\n00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:20,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go, so\n\n730\n00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,710\nwe can just pop right in.\n\n731\n00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,580\nWhen you're in the computer there's\na little gap between the board and\n\n732\n00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,240\nthe case and the card slides right in.\n\n733\n00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,650\nI was hitting the table right here.\n\n734\n00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,505\nSo they just pop right in and\nnow I've got an extra video port.\n\n735\n00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,460\nRight?\nAnd I'm ready to rock.\n\n736\n00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,836\nA high end video graphics card will,\nfirst off will be much larger than this.\n\n737\n00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:39,353\nRight?\n\n738\n00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,010\nAnd secondly\n>> Bulky.\n\n739\n00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,980\n>> It'll have additional power connectors.\n\n740\n00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,460\nThey draw a lot of power so\n\n741\n00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,130\nyou have to run some power cables\ndirectly to the video card.\n\n742\n00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,030\nIt's not uncommon.\n\n743\n00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,356\nAll right.\n>> The next expansion card is gonna be\n\n744\n00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:53,270\nthe sound card.\n\n745\n00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,000\nNow, we already saw where\nwe had that 1/8 inch\n\n746\n00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,650\njack connector on\nthe back of the computer.\n\n747\n00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,970\nAnd that gives us the ability\nto play stereo sound.\n\n748\n00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,840\nLeft and\nright sound through that one connector.\n\n749\n00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,430\nAnd being able to actually set up\na couple of speakers is enough for, well,\n\n750\n00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,390\nif you're doing regular productivity work,\nand you like hearing that ding when you\n\n751\n00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,930\nactually do something wrong,\nor that sound.\n\n752\n00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,770\nBut what if you want to go ahead and\nturn your computer into a media center?\n\n753\n00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,020\nOr into something that plays better\nmusic and you're an audiophile?\n\n754\n00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,810\nWell, what we have here\nis an additional set.\n\n755\n00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,720\nNow, Don,\nif you take a look at this thing,\n\n756\n00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,170\nthere's a lot of different outputs that\nwe have available for us right here.\n\n757\n00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,150\nAnd so this actually gives us\nthe ability to do surround sound?\n\n758\n00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,770\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n759\n00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,605\nThis one has a ton of stuff on it.\n\n760\n00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's kind of hard to see, but\n\n761\n00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,790\nwe've got this standard stereo output,\nif we want that, right?\n\n762\n00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,870\nIt's got the microphone input if you\nwanna hook a microphone up to it.\n\n763\n00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:54,090\nIt has an unamplified input if you\nwant to run like a record player,\n\n764\n00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,260\nsomething like that into it, or whatever.\n\n765\n00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,670\nBut, some of these other ones like this\norange one is labeled digital out, and\n\n766\n00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,280\nit can push a digital signal out which\nmeans it can do 5.1 and 7.1, 7.2 audio.\n\n767\n00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,890\nSo it can handle surround sound systems.\n\n768\n00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,350\nMost of your onboard sound\ncards won't do that,\n\n769\n00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,620\nyou'll need to get an add-on board and\nthis one is no spring chicken.\n\n770\n00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> This isn't one,\n\n771\n00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,570\nI don't think you could\nstill buy this one.\n\n772\n00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,700\n>> It's a bit older.\n[LAUGH]\n\n773\n00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,770\n>> But when you go to the store they\n\n774\n00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,290\nlook just like this and then they have\nall of these different connectors.\n\n775\n00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,870\nSome will actually have a fiber optic\nport on the back labeled SPDIF.\n\n776\n00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,370\nAnd those are for\nrunning to media receivers.\n\n777\n00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,860\nLike, if you have\nan entertainment center at home,\n\n778\n00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,380\nyou might run it to the receiver there.\n\n779\n00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,570\nAnd again, just to be able to\npower multiple speakers and\n\n780\n00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,140\na subwoofer, to be able to,\nto get that true theater sound.\n\n781\n00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,730\nThat's an example of where\nyou'd need to upgrade that.\n\n782\n00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or, maybe you're a musician, right?\n\n783\n00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,910\nAnd you've got a keyboard and you want to\nrun it into a MIDI input, this port over\n\n784\n00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,930\nhere actually has a little adapter that\nturns it into MIDI, so you can run it into\n\n785\n00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:55,420\nyour synthesizer and you can start\nbanging out some sweet 80s retro music.\n\n786\n00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,170\nSo you've got that one.\n\n787\n00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,830\n>> And\nit even has that nice FireWire port.\n\n788\n00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,760\n>> Yeah, this one has FireWire, and\nthat's because this card was released when\n\n789\n00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,020\nFireWire wasn't necessarily\nguaranteed to be in every machine.\n\n790\n00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,890\nSo they decided to include it here,\njust a standard FireWire port.\n\n791\n00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,730\nYou can plug whatever the heck\nyou want in there, but\n\n792\n00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,750\nthey figured hey, if you're an audiophile,\nif you're really hardcore into audio and\n\n793\n00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,150\nyou want good clear stuff, you probably\nhave a camcorder or something you want to\n\n794\n00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,510\nfeed in and you can hook it up via\nFireWire to get at that so they added it.\n\n795\n00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,032\nIt's not always going to be there.\n\n796\n00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:24,040\nYou don't,\nit just depends on the card you buy.\n\n797\n00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n798\n00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,920\nOnce you get this thing hooked up,\nthere's many different connectors.\n\n799\n00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,620\nAs you can see right here on\nthis edge how many different\n\n800\n00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,640\nactual connectors that you'd have\nto go to be able to connect into\n\n801\n00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,250\nall the other different devices there.\n\n802\n00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,350\n>> Yeah, you have things like your\nCD drives that might plug directly\n\n803\n00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,870\nin here to be able to play audio\nright out of the speakers without\n\n804\n00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,450\nbothering your computer and there's\nother components here that might run\n\n805\n00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,865\nto the headphone jacks on the front\nof your computer and so on.\n\n806\n00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,160\nYou'll see different mixtures of this.\n\n807\n00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,472\nNow, sound cards,\nthey're just pushing sound and so\n\n808\n00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:55,369\nthey don't need a huge amount\nof bandwidth on the motherboard.\n\n809\n00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,440\nSo these PCI Express ports\nare generally a little overkill for\n\n810\n00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,875\nsomething as simple as a sound card.\n\n811\n00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:05,176\nSo most of the sound cards that you'll\nfind out there are gonna be like this,\n\n812\n00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:06,479\nwhich is what's called PCI.\n\n813\n00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:09,223\nThe older PCI standard uses\nthese white ports, right?\n\n814\n00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:11,800\nThe one I put my video card\nin here was a black port.\n\n815\n00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,220\nThe white port is PCI.\n\n816\n00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,650\nIt's slower, it's an older technology,\nbut it's more than adequate for\n\n817\n00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,420\na audio card or a sound card.\n\n818\n00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,570\nNow, they do make sound cards\non the faster ports, but\n\n819\n00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,620\nit's not really necessary.\n\n820\n00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,280\nSo if we wanna add one of these,\nwe just pop it in.\n\n821\n00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,690\nNow, at that point,\nour computer will have two sound cards.\n\n822\n00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,440\nIt'll have a sound card that's on\nboard on the mother board, and\n\n823\n00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,390\nit'll have the sound card we just added.\n\n824\n00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,290\nSo, when we fire up our operating system,\nwe'll have to go in there and\n\n825\n00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,620\ntell it which one to use because,\ntechnically, it could use either one.\n\n826\n00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,740\n>> Looks like we're starting to\nfill up our computer pretty good.\n\n827\n00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,820\n>> Well, let's keep that going.\n\n828\n00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,160\nAll right, what's next?\n\n829\n00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,480\nNetwork, right?\n\n830\n00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,764\nThis motherboard has a network\nadapter built into it, all right.\n\n831\n00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:52,890\nAnd so, that was over here, and\n\n832\n00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,870\nI don't know much about it\nbecause the computer is not on.\n\n833\n00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,870\nIt might be 100 megabit,\nit might be gigabit.\n\n834\n00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,661\nI don't know the speed, all right?\n\n835\n00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:01,256\nBut even if it's\nthe fastest one available,\n\n836\n00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:06,030\nI might want two network adapters,\nright, or three for various purposes.\n\n837\n00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,490\nFor me at home, I have two network\nadapters in my computer cuz I have one\n\n838\n00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,710\nthat I do HD video streaming\non to the TVs in my house.\n\n839\n00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,650\nAnd I have another one that I just use for\nInternet access.\n\n840\n00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,080\nAnd I didn't want every time I downloaded\na file, to have my video quality suffer.\n\n841\n00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,870\nSo I put two network adapters\nin my computer at home.\n\n842\n00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,540\nNow, network adapters can\nmove a lot of data, but\n\n843\n00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,750\nnot necessarily as much as\nlike a video card would.\n\n844\n00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,830\nVideo cards move huge amounts of data.\n\n845\n00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,720\nSo, there's actually a different type of\nPCI Express port that we'll see used for\n\n846\n00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,730\nsome adaptors like network adaptors.\n\n847\n00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,714\nAnd so the example I have here is\nan add on card that's PCI express,\n\n848\n00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,745\nbut it's the smaller form, all right.\n\n849\n00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:45,828\nNow this is really bizarre.\n\n850\n00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:49,620\nIf you get a sound card that's\nPCI Express, it'll look like this too.\n\n851\n00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,550\nIt's the smaller connector,\ncuz we don't need all of those pins to be\n\n852\n00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,070\nable to connect this in and\ngain the access.\n\n853\n00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,210\nSo, let's take these cards out, Ronnie.\n\n854\n00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,324\nAnd if we look, that little black port\nall the way over there at the edge,\n\n855\n00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,630\nright, that is a PCI Express port.\n\n856\n00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,550\nAnd I can take this adapter and\nplug it right in there, and\n\n857\n00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,820\nnow I've got an extra network\nconnection on my system, right?\n\n858\n00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,100\nThere's my extra gigabit\nnetwork connection.\n\n859\n00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,082\nBut that will also fit in the bigger port.\n\n860\n00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:26,930\nAll right, but it leaves most of these\npins unplugged, and that's fine.\n\n861\n00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,529\nWhen you get a PCI Express card,\nyou'll find that they're labelled\n\n862\n00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:36,536\nthings like PCI x16 and PCI x8 which\nreflects the speed that they run at.\n\n863\n00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,703\nThere's different speeds.\n\n864\n00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:41,084\nBut the different devices,\nif it's a simple device like this,\n\n865\n00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:44,720\ndoesn't need the full bus,\nand it just leaves them off.\n\n866\n00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,270\nAnd so a small port like this reflects\na device that doesn't need the full bus,\n\n867\n00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,830\nversus this video card that does.\n\n868\n00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,730\nIt's got the whole thing.\n\n869\n00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,580\nIf I were to put this card over here,\nit won't fit.\n\n870\n00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,870\nIt actually won't go in that.\n\n871\n00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,300\nThis one needs the full bus to work.\n\n872\n00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,520\nSo keep that in mind when\nyou deal with PCI Express,\n\n873\n00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,270\nthat there are these two different\ntypes of sizes that you might have.\n\n874\n00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,170\nAnd, oh, I put it in crooked,\nand it's not going to work now.\n\n875\n00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,745\nAnd if you're a little more graceful than\nme, you can get these in in one try.\n\n876\n00:43:13,745 --> 00:43:14,623\nBut there we go.\n\n877\n00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,590\nSo we can just pop that in now.\n\n878\n00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,290\nWe can pop this one in over there.\n\n879\n00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,980\nAnd now I've got both of those guys up and\nrunning.\n\n880\n00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,665\nAnd I guess we could throw\nour sound card back in.\n\n881\n00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:26,995\nRight, we'll go for filling this thing up.\n\n882\n00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:29,270\nWe're going to see how\nmuch stuff we can get in.\n\n883\n00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,690\nNow we do have a limit to the amount\nof ports that are in our system.\n\n884\n00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,870\nIf you need even more ports, you've got\nto buy another mother board, right.\n\n885\n00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,650\nThere's no way to add\nmore ports to the system.\n\n886\n00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,420\nI have seen people that sell these little\nriser cards that turn them sideways.\n\n887\n00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,245\nThose are a terrible idea.\n\n888\n00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't ever buy those things.\n\n889\n00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,628\nThey are rarely any good.\n\n890\n00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:48,620\nAll right, what's last on our agenda?\n\n891\n00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,440\n>> Modem.\n>> Oh, of course.\n\n892\n00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,930\nYeah, now, we actually didn't have a modem\nhere to be able to show on the set.\n\n893\n00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,470\nI guess I can bring up a picture of it.\n\n894\n00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,010\nI can't even,\nI'm sure we can buy one, right?\n\n895\n00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,930\nLet's jump over to Newegg's website, but\n\n896\n00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,270\na modem is a card that goes into your\ncomputer, or I guess it could be external,\n\n897\n00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,630\nbut oftentimes are a card\nin your computer.\n\n898\n00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,230\nAnd it'll let you\ncommunicate on a phone line.\n\n899\n00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,450\nSo if you have dial up internet access, or\n\n900\n00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,410\nsomething like that,\nthen you will use a modem to do it, right.\n\n901\n00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:22,080\nSo I'm just going to see if I can shop and\nfind one here.\n\n902\n00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,808\nBut basically you pop it\ninto your computer, and\n\n903\n00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:24,914\nthen it will have a phone jack.\n\n904\n00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:29,980\nAnd you plug your phone cable in, and then\nyou can dial out via telephone to find it.\n\n905\n00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,245\nAnd we had this problem\nwith Newegg the other day.\n\n906\n00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:34,036\nTheir site was going extremely slow.\n\n907\n00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:40,050\nLet me just jump to Amazon, and\nwe'll do a 56k dial up modem.\n\n908\n00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,543\nThere we go.\nThere's some internal ones and USB,\n\n909\n00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,286\nfancy, I haven't seen those.\n\n910\n00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:47,120\nLet's make it a PCI one.\n\n911\n00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,370\nI want an internal.\n\n912\n00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,455\nI don't want to mess around with-\n>> C-I, yeah.\n\n913\n00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,538\n>> An external.\n\n914\n00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:52,578\nThere we go.\n\n915\n00:44:52,578 --> 00:44:56,828\nHero, a household brand name,\nthat I've never heard of, but whatever.\n\n916\n00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:58,480\nWe'll go with them, 12 bucks.\n\n917\n00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,350\nSo for 12 bucks,\n\n918\n00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,170\nyou can throw this card in your\ncomputer and plug a phone line into it.\n\n919\n00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,393\nNow you'll be able to make and\nreceive phone calls,\n\n920\n00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:09,788\nexcept we don't normally make analogue\nphone calls from inside of a computer.\n\n921\n00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:12,969\nSo we'll normally use this for\nfax communications,\n\n922\n00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,953\nsending a fax or receiving a fax.\n\n923\n00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:17,660\nYou can hook it up to a phone line,\nand it'll do that.\n\n924\n00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,250\nThese are becoming less and\n\n925\n00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,500\nless common just because most\npeople don't use modems anymore.\n\n926\n00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,000\nBut if we an internal,\nwe can buy a card like that, or\n\n927\n00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,080\nif you want an external,\nthat's what I've found in my first search.\n\n928\n00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,270\nYou'll have a lot of these boxes that\nare ones that hook up to a serial port.\n\n929\n00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:33,770\nOh come on.\n\n930\n00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,594\nAnd they hook up to a serial port, so\n\n931\n00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:40,703\nthey're outside where we can get a USB\none, and they'll work that way too.\n\n932\n00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,582\nSo here's a 56 k modem that's USB.\n\n933\n00:45:42,582 --> 00:45:44,036\nYou just plug it in.\n\n934\n00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:47,953\nAnd then here's the old style\nUSRobotics external ones.\n\n935\n00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,444\nThese are nice cuz you get\nall the various lights, so\n\n936\n00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:54,020\nyou can tell the status of them, and\nit's good nostalgia factor, right?\n\n937\n00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,670\nBut those are modems,\nvery uncommon these days.\n\n938\n00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,440\nIn fact,\nwhen most people talk about modems today,\n\n939\n00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,330\nthey're normally talking about\ntheir DSL or Cable modems,\n\n940\n00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,930\nwhich are an entirely different animal,\nright, than what we see here.\n\n941\n00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,760\nThose don't hook up inside of your\ncomputer, or right to you computer.\n\n942\n00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,095\nThey hook up to your network instead.\n\n943\n00:46:11,095 --> 00:46:13,270\nThey're a separate device entirely.\n\n944\n00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,660\nThese modems, they won't work unless\nthey're hooked up into a PC, right?\n\n945\n00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,040\nThat's what they have to have to function.\n\n946\n00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,240\nAll right, so those are the last of\nthe expansion cards that they call out.\n\n947\n00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,660\nThe rest of the objective is just focused\non a few other components that we'll find\n\n948\n00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,890\non the motherboard.\n\n949\n00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,940\nSo let's talk a little bit\nmore about the motherboard.\n\n950\n00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,470\nNow, we looked at the motherboard earlier.\n\n951\n00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,560\nLet's look at this one.\n\n952\n00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,850\nI guess we can pop these cards back out,\njust make it a little easier to see.\n\n953\n00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,460\nBut the motherboard, we have all\nthis stuff that plugs into it, and\n\n954\n00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,970\nthe motherboard is allowing all of these\ndifferent devices to talk to each other.\n\n955\n00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,300\nFor the most part,\nthey're not talking to each other.\n\n956\n00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,630\nThey're talking to this guy right here,\nthe CPU.\n\n957\n00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,280\nThat's who they want to talk to, and\nthe motherboard facilitates that.\n\n958\n00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,760\nNow, it's kind of hard to see it here,\nbut I'm gonna flip this over.\n\n959\n00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,036\nAnd on the bottom side of the board,\nwe can really see what's going on.\n\n960\n00:47:03,036 --> 00:47:06,100\nWell, the studio lights\nare gonna pick some of these up.\n\n961\n00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,720\nBut what you can see are all of\nthese little microscopic cables,\n\n962\n00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,790\nwell, not microscopic,\nyou can see them with the naked eye.\n\n963\n00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,320\nThere's all these little copper traces,\n\n964\n00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,990\ncopper lines, that are running\ninside of this motherboard.\n\n965\n00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,710\nAnd you can see where my PCI ports are.\n\n966\n00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,900\nHere's that full size PCI Express,\nthe regular PCI, the smaller PCI Express.\n\n967\n00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,730\nYou can see the four\nmemory banks over here.\n\n968\n00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,776\nAnd all the little connections coming,\n\n969\n00:47:33,776 --> 00:47:36,570\nI see all these little\nwires coming out of it.\n\n970\n00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,060\nAnd where do they run?\n\n971\n00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,150\nThey all run right here.\n\n972\n00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,630\nSee, you can kind of see all the stuff\ncoming to this point right here.\n\n973\n00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,880\nSo, what do you think is there\non the other side of the board?\n\n974\n00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,118\nThe CPU, that's where it sits.\n\n975\n00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:52,784\nSo, the motherboard is really\njust connecting all this\n\n976\n00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:55,439\nstuff right back to that point, right.\n\n977\n00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:59,554\nNow, as you advance into your IT learning,\nyou'll find out about some other\n\n978\n00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:03,876\ntechnologies that let people skip past\nthe processor to get directly to things.\n\n979\n00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:06,374\nBut, for the most part,\neverything goes to the CPU.\n\n980\n00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:10,974\nNow, a lot of these other devices out\nhere, your sound card, your video card and\n\n981\n00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,003\nso on, will want to access RAM, and\n\n982\n00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:17,250\nthey'll typically go through\nthe processor and then to the RAM.\n\n983\n00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:22,550\nThe processor usually has exclusive access\nto the RAM with a few exceptions, but\n\n984\n00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,320\nthat's kind of the way the things running.\n\n985\n00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,650\nThis is called a bus.\n\n986\n00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,950\nThe bus is [INAUDIBLE]\n>> The bus is\n\n987\n00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,680\nthe physical pathway that allows us\nto have those different expansion\n\n988\n00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,720\ncards that we talked about,\nand the RAM and\n\n989\n00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,810\nthe connections from cables to actually\nbe able to communicate with each other.\n\n990\n00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,730\nSo, if you don't have\nthe physical pathways,\n\n991\n00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,700\nthey will not be able to communicate.\n\n992\n00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,170\nThe motherboard helps by\nkeeping it all in one place and\n\n993\n00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,950\nallow for multiple access and\n\n994\n00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,390\nthe CPU to be able to connect all those\ndifferent physical, you know, traces.\n\n995\n00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n996\n00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,800\nAnd all of it is coded inside\nof this green silicon so\n\n997\n00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,130\nyou can't mess with it too much, right?\n\n998\n00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,630\nThe main reason they code it like this is\nthat if you were ever to take something\n\n999\n00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,800\nthat was conductive and cross two of these\nlines, it'll short out the system and\n\n1000\n00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,660\nIf it's on, that'll cause some big\nproblems, but even if it's off, you can\n\n1001\n00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,940\nsend charge in there which wouldn't be\nsomething that you'd want to have happen.\n\n1002\n00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,500\nSo, they coat it to protect it.\n\n1003\n00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,770\nBut a lot of these points,\n\n1004\n00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,990\nall these little dots, I know it's kind of\n>> Soldering points.\n\n1005\n00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,310\n>> Difficult for you guys to see, but\n\n1006\n00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,720\nthey're actually really sharp,\nkind of hurts to push on them.\n\n1007\n00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,770\nAnd those are solder joints, and\nthey actually do stick out a little bit.\n\n1008\n00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,600\n>> You can see them.\n\n1009\n00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,850\n>> You can sort of see how they\nprotrude there, and so, it is\n\n1010\n00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,020\neasy to kinda short that out if you're not\ncareful, if you lay that down on metal.\n\n1011\n00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,290\nSo, you'll notice inside of a computer\nthere's almost always these little risers,\n\n1012\n00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:46,420\nthese little plastic bits that sit\naround and lift this up from the case,\n\n1013\n00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,270\nso it doesn't actually touch the case.\n\n1014\n00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,950\nAnd everywhere you see where\nwould be a screw, if you notice,\n\n1015\n00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,520\nyou can always see the wires\nkind of dodge around that screw.\n\n1016\n00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,970\nSo, there's this kind of gap right here,\na gap here.\n\n1017\n00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,600\nThese are where the screws are that\nconnect it to the case, and\n\n1018\n00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,930\nthey skip around it so\nthat they won't accidentally ground.\n\n1019\n00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,350\nIf they ever get too close, the maldamore\nmanufacturer will have to put something\n\n1020\n00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,770\non it to help protect it, and\nyou can see they've done that here.\n\n1021\n00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,120\nThey've kinda coated that area,\njust to be on the safe side, and,\n\n1022\n00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,740\nyou can even see that up here\non the top of the board.\n\n1023\n00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,320\nAlthough, it's a lot more crowded.\n\n1024\n00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,830\nWhen you spot those holes,\nthere will be a gap around it.\n\n1025\n00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,700\nNot a giant gap, but\nenough to ensure that the screw you\n\n1026\n00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,870\nput in there doesn't come in contact\nwith the rest of the components.\n\n1027\n00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,120\nAll right, few other things to\nthink about on the motherboard.\n\n1028\n00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,980\nThe cpu is making all the decisions\nas far as you're concerned.\n\n1029\n00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,125\nThe programs that you run and so on,\nbut there's another chip on here,\n\n1030\n00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:49,775\nthis guy,\nwhich is called the chip set, and\n\n1031\n00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:53,175\nthe chip set is responsible for\na few different things.\n\n1032\n00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,975\nBut it's the chip set that determines\nwhat your motherboard supports.\n\n1033\n00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:59,985\nRemember, Ronnie mentioned earlier that\nmost motherboards have a maximum amount of\n\n1034\n00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:01,580\nmemory that they can support.\n\n1035\n00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,340\nWell, it's your chipset\nthat determines that, and\n\n1036\n00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,530\nif you've got an onboard sound card,\n\n1037\n00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,490\nit's your chipset that controls how it\nturns on and off and how you talk to it.\n\n1038\n00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,000\nSo, a lot of the communications on\nthe motherboard go through that chipset.\n\n1039\n00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,710\nBut unlike a CPU, which is pretty\nstandard, chipsets are not.\n\n1040\n00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,220\nSo, different vendors manufacture,\ndifferent chipsets This one happens to be\n\n1041\n00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:27,320\nIntel, but yours might be Asus, or\nwho are some of the big names these days?\n\n1042\n00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,020\n>> Gigabyte.\n\n1043\n00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,700\n>> Gigabyte.\n\n1044\n00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,600\nI was thinking Megabit and\nI knew that wasn't right.\n\n1045\n00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,720\nGigabyte, I mean there's\na ton of other ones.\n\n1046\n00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,990\nAsrock I know is a big one, and\nthey can create their own chipsets or\n\n1047\n00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,750\nthey can license chipsets\nfrom the other providers.\n\n1048\n00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,700\nSo, you might get a motherboard\nfrom one vendor but\n\n1049\n00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,150\nthe chipset is actually from Intel.\n\n1050\n00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,090\nThat's not an uncommon occurrence.\n\n1051\n00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:48,400\n>> Yeah, and even within\n\n1052\n00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,460\nsingle motherboard manufacturer\n>> You might see there might be even\n\n1053\n00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,360\nmultiple different chips\nsets that are available too.\n\n1054\n00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,290\nDepending on the high performance, or, or\nthe economy class computer that you get.\n\n1055\n00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,870\n>> All right.\nThere's not too much more to talk about in\n\n1056\n00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,780\nthe mother board, is there?\n\n1057\n00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,085\nOh, the battery.\n\n1058\n00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:07,058\n[LAUGH] It's probably something useful,\nisn't it.\n\n1059\n00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:07,661\n>> Yeah.\n\n1060\n00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:11,300\n>> Your motherboard has a chipset and\n\n1061\n00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,680\nit also has another chip called a bios,\nand that's the basic input-output system.\n\n1062\n00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,250\nAnd when you push the power button on your\ncomputer, the bios is what fires up first.\n\n1063\n00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,400\nIt's the one that turns on the CPU,\nand turns on the memory, and\n\n1064\n00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,220\nturns all this stuff on, and then turns\nover control of the operating system.\n\n1065\n00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,770\nAnd so the bios has certain\nsettings in it that we configure,\n\n1066\n00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,710\nthat we tell it where the hard\ndrives are and so on.\n\n1067\n00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,690\nAnd usually the vendor takes care of that,\nDell or HP, so\n\n1068\n00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,610\nwe don't have to worry about it, but those\nsettings have to be stored somewhere.\n\n1069\n00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,100\nAnd so, they're stored in a little\nmemory chip on the motherboard that you\n\n1070\n00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,310\ndon't mess with.\n\n1071\n00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:49,000\nBut that memory chip requires\na battery to keep the settings stable.\n\n1072\n00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,580\nNot every motherboard but\nmost motherboards\n\n1073\n00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,050\nwill have a very visible battery like\nthe one that Ronnie's pointing at.\n\n1074\n00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n1075\n00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,230\nThe battery is typically just a,\na regular,\n\n1076\n00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:04,240\nlooks like a watch battery that you\nsee in a normally a CR2032 battery.\n\n1077\n00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,370\nAnd that you simply need to\nreplace every once in a while.\n\n1078\n00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,840\nNow when you start seeing your\ncomputer system as it boots up,\n\n1079\n00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,410\nyou might see where is working\nperfectly fine, everything boots up.\n\n1080\n00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,130\nNext time you reboot it,\nIt tells you the hard drive is missing and\n\n1081\n00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,100\nyou just press F1 you continue and\neverything is just fine, but\n\n1082\n00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,740\nusually the way that we see it is when\nyou logged into the operating system\n\n1083\n00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,290\nthe time is normally not going to be set\nright every time that you go into it.\n\n1084\n00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,020\n>> Yeah,\ntime is usually how I normally notice it.\n\n1085\n00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,690\nIf your system clock is wrong\nconsistently, you fix it and\n\n1086\n00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,000\nthen it's wrong again Or you build up and\nget a message saying the amount of RAM in\n\n1087\n00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,380\nyour system has changed, but\nyou know it hasn't, right?\n\n1088\n00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,810\nThose are good indicators that your\nbattery is dying on the system board, and\n\n1089\n00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,990\nthey are typically just\nregular watch batteries.\n\n1090\n00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,630\nYou can go down to a drugstore or whatever\nand pick them up for a couple of dollars.\n\n1091\n00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,920\nMost of them are weighted for\nthree years, much like our guys.\n\n1092\n00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,600\nSo, you get about three years, but\nthey'll usually run much, much longer.\n\n1093\n00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,970\nBut if you've had your computer\na long time, it can happen.\n\n1094\n00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,540\nAnd I know we have some computers in a,\n\n1095\n00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,960\na classroom here in the building that\nwere all bought at the same time.\n\n1096\n00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,730\nAnd after about, it was like right\nafter three years, that, all of them,\n\n1097\n00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,190\ntheir batteries were going\nout at the same time.\n\n1098\n00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,100\nAnd, so, we just had to buy a big\nbatch of batteries and go and\n\n1099\n00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,470\nreplace them all, it does happen, right?\n\n1100\n00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,590\nSome motherboards have switched these new\nrechargeable batteries that are kind of\n\n1101\n00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,730\nsoldered on to the board, and so you might\nsee a physical battery you can replace.\n\n1102\n00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,340\nIf that's the case Those batteries are\nrated for much greater lifetimes, and so\n\n1103\n00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,990\nwe don't have to worry about those so\nmuch any more.\n\n1104\n00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,690\nYou see a lot of servers\nhave moved to that model.\n\n1105\n00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,170\nBut in desktops, that little watch\nbattery is still pretty common.\n\n1106\n00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,810\nAll right.\nRonnie,\n\n1107\n00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,190\nwe still have cooling to talk about.\n\n1108\n00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,500\n>> Okay.\n>> Fans and all that good stuff.\n\n1109\n00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,630\nBut this is a good spot to pause and\ntake a break, and when we get back,\n\n1110\n00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,340\nwe'll dive into that.\n\n1111\n00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,410\nIt's pretty good stuff, and\nthen we'll wrap up from there.\n\n1112\n00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,256\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back with\nour final segment after this.\n\n1113\n00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:57,014\n[MUSIC]\n\n1114\n00:54:57,014 --> 00:54:58,291\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1115\n00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:01,569\nSo, in this segment, we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about pooling, and\n\n1116\n00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:05,050\nI know we mentioned that briefly\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n1117\n00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,890\nAll of these PC components generate heat,\nand there,\n\n1118\n00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,120\nthere's this whole science behind it,\nbut basically you got, a,\n\n1119\n00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,190\na lot of electricity going through your\nsystem, and when your system is running\n\n1120\n00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,975\nefficiently, all that electricity\nElectricity gets consumed, and that's it.\n\n1121\n00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:23,515\nBut modern electrical components\nare rarely efficient,\n\n1122\n00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,625\nand some of the energy gets wasted.\n\n1123\n00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,225\nThe energy that's wasted\nis expressed in heat.\n\n1124\n00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:31,805\nAnd so the hotter a device is\nthe less efficient it is, and\n\n1125\n00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:36,205\nunfortunately CPUs tend to be the least\nefficient with how they handle power.\n\n1126\n00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:40,930\nSo, there's a ton of heat to come off If\nyou had a computer back in the 80's or\n\n1127\n00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,040\neven the early 90's.\n\n1128\n00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,697\nIf you had like a 386 or a 486,\n\n1129\n00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:47,566\nit's possible that when you opened up the\ncomputer you would just see the processor\n\n1130\n00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:50,623\nsitting there just like we're\nseeing here on this mother board.\n\n1131\n00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:54,120\nWhere you just see the CPU,\nit's right there, but\n\n1132\n00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,016\nstarting with the Pentiums, and\nreally the Pentium 2's and higher.\n\n1133\n00:55:59,016 --> 00:56:04,310\nThe processors were getting so fast and\nthe transistors were jammed in so\n\n1134\n00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,000\nclose that the heat became unmanageable.\n\n1135\n00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,010\nAnd so we had to start taking\nextra steps to cool the PC.\n\n1136\n00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,300\nAnd it started with a case fan, a fan\nmounted to the front of the case that\n\n1137\n00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,480\nwould suck in air out of the front and\nblow it out the back or vice versa,\n\n1138\n00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,480\nthere was no set order, and move that\nair to help cool off the components.\n\n1139\n00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:29,220\n>> The fans that we generated at\nthe very beginning were small fans.\n\n1140\n00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,130\nJust enough to really move air\nacross the surface of the CPU so\n\n1141\n00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,660\nthat we could dissipate\nthe heat much quicker.\n\n1142\n00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,020\nBut as the CPUs started\nbecoming more powerful,\n\n1143\n00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,110\nstarted generating more and\nmore heat, that was insufficient.\n\n1144\n00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,990\nAnd the reason why it was insufficient\nis that those fans were just\n\n1145\n00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:47,420\nnot generating enough airflow across them.\n\n1146\n00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:51,510\nSo what also began to happen is that\nthey needed a better way to dissipate\n\n1147\n00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,760\nthe heat quicker, so\n\n1148\n00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,820\nthey needed to expand the surface area\nthat they were blowing the air across.\n\n1149\n00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,740\nAnd that's when we get introduced\nto things like heat sinks.\n\n1150\n00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,410\n>> Yeah.\nIf you think about dinner, so\n\n1151\n00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:06,630\nyou get a piece of chicken for\ndinner and it's really hot.\n\n1152\n00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,600\nWell, you can wait and it will cool down.\n\n1153\n00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,660\nBut while you wait,\n\n1154\n00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,660\na lot of the heat is trapped in\nthe middle of it and it stays there.\n\n1155\n00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,900\nBut if you cut it up,\nnow the heat dissipates faster.\n\n1156\n00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,950\nWhat you're doing is,\nyou're increasing the surface area.\n\n1157\n00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,560\nYou're increasing the area where\nheat can escape that device.\n\n1158\n00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,480\nAnd in computers we can do the same\nthing with what's called a heat sink.\n\n1159\n00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,280\nA heat sink is just a hunk of metal\nthat has fins on it, or ridges, and\n\n1160\n00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,600\nit increases the surface area.\n\n1161\n00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,290\nSo, Ron, you got a pretty\nimpressive one right here.\n\n1162\n00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n1163\n00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,580\nSo in the beginning, when we started\nto actually dissipate the heat,\n\n1164\n00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,050\nit was really kind of this little\nmetal block right down here.\n\n1165\n00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,500\nYou might have seen two or three fins,\n\n1166\n00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:50,260\nto be able to multiply the surface area\nof that CPU just two or three times.\n\n1167\n00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,625\nBut when they started actually\nrealizing what they could do,\n\n1168\n00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:57,330\nto cut more fins, every single surface\narea that you see, this side, and\n\n1169\n00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:01,090\nthat side, they keep going up and\ndown and cut all that.\n\n1170\n00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,900\nIt expands that surface area so much,\n\n1171\n00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,820\nheat can now rapidly dissipate from the\nCPU surface throughout all of these fins.\n\n1172\n00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,100\nAnd then as air blows across it,\n\n1173\n00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,250\nit's blowing across every single surface,\nremoving the heat much faster.\n\n1174\n00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,400\n>> Yeah, if it were just that block.\n\n1175\n00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,220\nLet's turn it this way.\n\n1176\n00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,250\nIf it were just that block,\nyou'd have this surface area,\n\n1177\n00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,980\nright here, that was doing the cooling.\n\n1178\n00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,240\nAnd that might be, you know, a couple\nof centimeters square and that's it.\n\n1179\n00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,020\nBut, when you tack these fins on,\nwe're increasing the surface area,\n\n1180\n00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,850\nthe amount of metal exposed to the air-\n>> 12, 20 times here.\n\n1181\n00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,410\n>> Several times over, right, and\nthat's going to make it cool faster.\n\n1182\n00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:41,550\nThe heat will dissipate and just the air\nmoving through the case from the case\n\n1183\n00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,320\nfan will blow through this and\ntake that heat away.\n\n1184\n00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,780\nNow, Ronnie, you mentioned\nheat sinks started out small.\n\n1185\n00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,680\nWe actually do have a small\none here on the motherboard.\n\n1186\n00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,400\nI wonder if I could get that.\n\n1187\n00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,780\nI might need a screwdriver to\nget that one off of there.\n\n1188\n00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,860\nBut there is a a heat sink\nright here on the motherboard.\n\n1189\n00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,372\nYou can see that it is considerably\nsmaller than that one that we were just\n\n1190\n00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:00,071\nshowing you.\n\n1191\n00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:01,863\nYou see those fins right there.\n\n1192\n00:59:01,863 --> 00:59:04,680\nAnd that one is sitting\non top of something.\n\n1193\n00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,310\nThat might be a-\n>> I think that's a Northbridge there.\n\n1194\n00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,450\n>> Oh, there's the, was I not\npointing at the chip set earlier?\n\n1195\n00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,450\nIs the chip set under there or-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1196\n00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,270\n>> Okay.\nSo\n\n1197\n00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,130\nyou'll have a number of\ncontrollers on your board.\n\n1198\n00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,810\nYou might have one that,\nmaybe its a network controller.\n\n1199\n00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,793\nOh, you know,\n[CROSSTALK] this has on board video, so\n\n1200\n00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,817\nthat's probably the video\nprocessor in there.\n\n1201\n00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:23,390\nYou can have different controllers for\ndifferent things.\n\n1202\n00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,950\nBut whatever was there\napparently generated more\n\n1203\n00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:29,500\nheat than the system was ready for,\nand so they popped a heat sink on it.\n\n1204\n00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,490\nIn your regular CPU,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n1205\n00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:36,450\nYou get something like this and it will\nsit right there on top of that processor,\n\n1206\n00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,750\nincreasing its surface area.\n\n1207\n00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,555\nNow, this one, it's a pretty good size.\n\n1208\n00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:43,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This, I'd be impressed\n\n1209\n00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,164\nif I saw this one.\n\n1210\n00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,633\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a big PC.\n\n1211\n00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:46,166\n>> Yeah.\n\n1212\n00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,238\n>> But it's not the biggest,\nis it, Ronnie?\n\n1213\n00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:48,280\n>> No, no.\n\n1214\n00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,610\nNowhere closest to being the biggest.\n\n1215\n00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:54,340\nAnd these are what we call very passive\nheat sinks, they just sit there, and\n\n1216\n00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:58,050\ntheir ability to absorb the heat,\nagain, gives that rise.\n\n1217\n00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:58,550\nBut.\n\n1218\n00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,870\n>> Yeah.\nOh, yeah.\n\n1219\n01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,115\n>> Let's go to the big dog.\n\n1220\n01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:05,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n1221\n01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:10,050\nwe can get a little bit larger in\nthe surface area of our heat sinks.\n\n1222\n01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:15,890\nSo notice how this one actually has\nmultiple, well, again, surface areas.\n\n1223\n01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,760\nBut, we still have the single\nheat sink underneath.\n\n1224\n01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,400\nNow we have these different\npipes that come off them,\n\n1225\n01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,930\nwhich are a bit more efficient\nin dissipating the heat too.\n\n1226\n01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,880\n>> Yeah, on the very bottom you\nstill have a flat plate and\n\n1227\n01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,640\nthat's what's gonna attach to\nthe surface of your processor, and\n\n1228\n01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,510\nthe heat starts to dissipate into this\ninitial block, this heat sink down here.\n\n1229\n01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,990\nThe copper tubing is all hollow.\n\n1230\n01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,350\nThe heat gets in there and\ncopper is a great conductor.\n\n1231\n01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,030\nSo it's whipping it up\naway from the processor,\n\n1232\n01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:47,850\nand you'll see we have hundreds\nof very thin fins, right?\n\n1233\n01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,970\nIt's not the thick fins\nlike we saw on this one,\n\n1234\n01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:55,178\nbut thin ones, which help that heat\nmove very quickly and dissipate out.\n\n1235\n01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:57,090\nNow, this one is gigantic,\n\n1236\n01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,040\nand hopefully you don't have one\nthat's this big in your system.\n\n1237\n01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,010\nThis one is designed for\n\n1238\n01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,570\npeople who are doing things like\noverclocking their processor or gamers,\n\n1239\n01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:09,030\nwhere they run their processors at real\nhigh utilization for long periods of time.\n\n1240\n01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:15,212\nSo a heat sink can be extremely big and\ncomplex, or it can be like this.\n\n1241\n01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:15,874\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1242\n01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:16,440\n>> All right?\n\n1243\n01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,870\nBut a heat sink always has\none thing in common, and\n\n1244\n01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,980\nthat is,\nit is what's called passive cooling.\n\n1245\n01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,880\nAnd passive cooling means no moving parts.\n\n1246\n01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,530\nThere's no power cable\nthat hooks up to this.\n\n1247\n01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,530\nThere's no moving parts.\n\n1248\n01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,500\nIt works simply by being metal.\n\n1249\n01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,250\nMetal conducts electricity,\nmoves it out, or it conducts heat and\n\n1250\n01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,250\nthen the heat moves along to\nget dissipated by our fans.\n\n1251\n01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,780\nSo this is passive cooling.\n\n1252\n01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,590\nYour computer won't work with\njust passive cooling alone.\n\n1253\n01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:44,330\nThey did in the beginning.\n\n1254\n01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:45,600\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> Those early Pentiums,\n\n1255\n01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,430\nthey would work just fine.\n\n1256\n01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:48,290\nBut now we need more.\n\n1257\n01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,080\nWe need active cooling.\n\n1258\n01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,570\nAnd active cooling most commonly\ntakes the form of a fan.\n\n1259\n01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:54,550\nSo Ronnie, you've got one.\n\n1260\n01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:55,350\n>> Yep.\n\n1261\n01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,770\nSo fans are normally of different sizes.\n\n1262\n01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:01,080\nThis one, I don't know exactly\nhow big this one might be.\n\n1263\n01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,240\nBut this one can sit, and I believe this\none actually does sit along those fins.\n\n1264\n01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,300\n>> Is this the one that came off?\n\n1265\n01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,326\n>> This one's designed to be a case fan.\n\n1266\n01:02:08,326 --> 01:02:12,180\nSo this is the, it's supposed to be\na case fan to move air through the case.\n\n1267\n01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,110\nThe really big ones are case fans.\n\n1268\n01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:18,110\nSmall ones like this, those are designed\nfor processors and components.\n\n1269\n01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,830\nAnd so you'll see this one mounted\nright on that video card's chipset.\n\n1270\n01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> But in this case that giant gaming heat\n\n1271\n01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,400\nsink, the company that made this decided,\nhey, wouldn't it be a great idea if we\n\n1272\n01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,165\ntook this fan and mounted it right\nto the front of that turkey?\n\n1273\n01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:32,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which, again helps the air to move off\n\n1274\n01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,340\nof this very fast.\n\n1275\n01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,852\nBut that is actually a case fan.\n\n1276\n01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:35,440\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, yeah.\n\n1277\n01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,050\n>> Yep.\n>> So\n\n1278\n01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,510\nif this were in the bottom\nof the computer case,\n\n1279\n01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:42,030\nwhat you might see is that the fan\nwould sit, or let's say like this.\n\n1280\n01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> And allow\n\n1281\n01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,640\nair to be able to move\nthrough the case this way or\n\n1282\n01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,820\ndraw it the other way, depending on\nthe direction that you set it in.\n\n1283\n01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,560\n>> Yep.\n\n1284\n01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,605\nSo those are big fans and\nthey are directional.\n\n1285\n01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:52,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Good point.\n\n1286\n01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,770\nAnd so when you look at these fans,\n\n1287\n01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,360\nthere's usually an arrow\non them somewhere.\n\n1288\n01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,879\nI'm gonna say that and then-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1289\n01:02:57,879 --> 01:02:59,440\n>> This one's not gonna have it.\n\n1290\n01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,230\nIt-\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n1291\n01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,940\n>> Doesn't.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1292\n01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,720\n>> A lot of times, they'll put an arrow\nto show which way the air blows,\n\n1293\n01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,500\ncuz if you put it in one way,\nit'll be sucking air into the case.\n\n1294\n01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,210\nIf you put it the other way,\nit'll be blowing air out of the case.\n\n1295\n01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:15,100\nAnd what you normally want is a fan in the\nfront of the case sucking in the nice cool\n\n1296\n01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,000\nair from the room, and\nyou might not need a rear fan,\n\n1297\n01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,890\nthe air might just push out naturally.\n\n1298\n01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:23,080\nBut to keep things speeded along, you\nmight need another fan towards the back of\n\n1299\n01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,700\nthe case that's taking it the rest of\nthe way, going in the same direction.\n\n1300\n01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,070\nIf you put them in the opposite direction,\nyou create a high pressure zone.\n\n1301\n01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,570\nI'm gonna turn into a weatherman now.\n\n1302\n01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:33,830\n>> Yes.\n>> You got a high pressure zone\n\n1303\n01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:34,690\nmoving in from the east.\n\n1304\n01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,000\nBut you would create a high pressure\nzone and the heat would be trapped.\n\n1305\n01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,920\nIt will stay there.\n\n1306\n01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,650\n>> Convection.\n\n1307\n01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,230\n>> And it's just gonna sit.\n\n1308\n01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,640\nWhereas heat is normally\ndrawn to the cooler air.\n\n1309\n01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,090\nThis is what creates our-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1310\n01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,000\n>> Cold and heat fronts in weather.\n\n1311\n01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,140\nAnd that won't happen if your\nfans are pointing at each other.\n\n1312\n01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:49,906\n>> Yeah.\n\n1313\n01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:53,709\n>> As good as these active cooling\nsystems are, and I like these and\n\n1314\n01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:57,239\nthey do work well,\nthey keep your computers nice and cool.\n\n1315\n01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,156\nAnd a lot of times they're hooked\ninto your motherboard which can also\n\n1316\n01:04:00,156 --> 01:04:02,880\ndynamically control\nthe speed of the fans too.\n\n1317\n01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,133\nThere's a more efficient cooling\nsystem that's actually out there, and\n\n1318\n01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:09,640\nthat involves what we call liquid cooling.\n\n1319\n01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,025\nIn the way that your car radiator\nworks which sends liquid into\n\n1320\n01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:16,638\nthe heated areas of your engine, and\n\n1321\n01:04:16,638 --> 01:04:20,959\nthen allows that heated water\nto be pumped out to a radiator.\n\n1322\n01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:24,396\nThe coolant systems tend to\nwork the same way for your CPU.\n\n1323\n01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:26,395\nKinda very neat, very quiet.\n\n1324\n01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,420\n>> Yeah,\nwater is a great conductor of heat.\n\n1325\n01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,690\nIt heats up quickly,\nyou can move it along.\n\n1326\n01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,920\nAnd if you have hot and cold water mixed,\n\n1327\n01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,940\nthe hot water naturally goes to\nthe surface and the cold water sinks.\n\n1328\n01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,538\nAnd so, that's kind of what happened\nuntil you get freezing point and\n\n1329\n01:04:40,538 --> 01:04:42,001\nthen all sorts of weird things happen.\n\n1330\n01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,432\nBut that's basically what happens.\n\n1331\n01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:48,240\nIt makes it a natural convector to\nget heat out and away from systems.\n\n1332\n01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,085\nThe problem is,\ndo we wanna put water on our computer?\n\n1333\n01:04:52,085 --> 01:04:54,724\nMost of us learned day one,\nget that drink away from the computer.\n\n1334\n01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,620\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> No drinks near the computer, right?\n\n1335\n01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,980\nYou don't wanna spill-\n>> Right.\n\n1336\n01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:58,715\n>> On your system.\n\n1337\n01:04:58,715 --> 01:04:59,380\nIt'd be bad.\n\n1338\n01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:04,230\nSo, water cooled PCs, this used to be\nan oddity, it used to be a rare thing,\n\n1339\n01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:08,940\nnow it's actually pretty common and\nthey're self-contained systems.\n\n1340\n01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,924\nThat means you can't see the water.\n\n1341\n01:05:10,924 --> 01:05:13,733\nIt's all contained inside\nof a series of blocks and\n\n1342\n01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,360\ntubes and you can't add more to it or\nanything.\n\n1343\n01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:16,967\nIt's just there.\n\n1344\n01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:18,847\nA lot of them don't\nactually use water anymore.\n\n1345\n01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,544\nThey use things like, not vegetable oil,\n\n1346\n01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:23,580\nbut-\n>> Mineral oil.\n\n1347\n01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,230\n>> Mineral oil, inside them, which also\nconducts the heat pretty well too, but\n\n1348\n01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,828\nit doesn't evaporate like water can.\n\n1349\n01:05:29,828 --> 01:05:33,740\nIf you use just regular water and\nit evaporated over time, you might\n\n1350\n01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,360\nthink you're being water cooled and\nit's actually empty and you don't know.\n\n1351\n01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,117\nSo, let me show you guys what most people\nthink of when they think of liquid\n\n1352\n01:05:42,117 --> 01:05:42,817\ncooling.\n\n1353\n01:05:42,817 --> 01:05:46,060\nThere's a company called Digital Storm\nout there that makes customized systems.\n\n1354\n01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,740\nAnd there's another\ncompany called Cryo-TEC,\n\n1355\n01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,550\nthat does these insane water coolers or\nliquid coolers.\n\n1356\n01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:56,827\nAnd what they do is they make a block\nthat sits right on top of your processor,\n\n1357\n01:05:56,827 --> 01:06:01,621\nand it pumps water in with one tube and\nsucks it out with the other one.\n\n1358\n01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:05,510\nAnd so there's this constant flow\nof water going across the surface.\n\n1359\n01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,090\nNow, the water never\nactually touches the CPU.\n\n1360\n01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,341\nThe heat enters into\nthe bottom of this block and\n\n1361\n01:06:11,341 --> 01:06:13,622\nthe water is inside of the block.\n\n1362\n01:06:13,622 --> 01:06:15,526\nAnd then it goes out the tubes so\n\n1363\n01:06:15,526 --> 01:06:19,786\nyou don't risk getting any moisture\nanywhere near your processor.\n\n1364\n01:06:19,786 --> 01:06:21,702\nIt's all contained.\n\n1365\n01:06:21,702 --> 01:06:26,582\nAnd then there's a pump that's pumping\nwater in and sucking the water out,\n\n1366\n01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,726\nkeeping that convection going.\n\n1367\n01:06:28,726 --> 01:06:30,606\nAt the other end of these tubes.\n\n1368\n01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:32,382\nLet me see if they show\na picture of the other end.\n\n1369\n01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:33,044\n>> There it is.\n\n1370\n01:06:33,044 --> 01:06:38,020\n>> It's actually,\nyeah [CROSSTALK] right down there.\n\n1371\n01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,560\nThey're not gonna show\nit in these pictures.\n\n1372\n01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,390\nDadgummit.\n\n1373\n01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:41,030\nWell, anyhow,\n\n1374\n01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,230\nat the other end of these tubes,\nruns to a radiator, just like in your car.\n\n1375\n01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,118\nIt really looks like kind of like this.\n\n1376\n01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:51,340\nIt runs to one of these things and\nit'll have a fan mounted on it.\n\n1377\n01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,900\nSo the heat from the water,\nthat heated water, comes in here and\n\n1378\n01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,470\nthe fan takes the heat away.\n\n1379\n01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,500\nAnd now the water is cool and it goes\nright back down to the processor again.\n\n1380\n01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,741\nAnd so it's cycling that through the\nsystem over and over again and whipping\n\n1381\n01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:08,860\nthat heat away and getting it away from\nthe processor as fast as possible.\n\n1382\n01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:13,318\nThey are very efficient but,\nthey're not exactly inexpensive.\n\n1383\n01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:15,416\nThey've gotten a lot better\nover the last few years.\n\n1384\n01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:18,324\nBut for up until maybe five or\nsix years ago,\n\n1385\n01:07:18,324 --> 01:07:21,704\nyou really saw these just\nin high end gaming rigs and\n\n1386\n01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:27,000\nextreme data centers where you had\nmassive amounts of CPUs in small areas.\n\n1387\n01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,879\nThey would liquid cool there too.\n\n1388\n01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:31,044\nAnd you can liquid cool\nmore than just your CPU.\n\n1389\n01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:33,329\nYou can cool your video card,\nyour hard drives,\n\n1390\n01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:37,460\nyou can do all sorts of things this way\nbut you don't typically have to, right?\n\n1391\n01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,060\nYour processor, that's the one\nthat generates the most heat.\n\n1392\n01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,520\nNow, I have a liquid cooler\non my computer at home.\n\n1393\n01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,529\nI am a tightwad, though.\n\n1394\n01:07:44,529 --> 01:07:46,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I won't spend anything\n\n1395\n01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,260\ncrazy like that.\n\n1396\n01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,370\nI have a system that's from Corsair.\n\n1397\n01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:54,825\nAnd they create these self contained\nsystems that work really, really easy.\n\n1398\n01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:59,155\nLet me show you the one you, you see\nthey start up here at three or $130 but\n\n1399\n01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:00,247\nthat's too much.\n\n1400\n01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:03,570\nSo if you scroll down we'll find the one\nthat I have, where is the one that I have?\n\n1401\n01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,349\nThis one.\n\n1402\n01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:06,500\nSo, I have this guy right here, $80.\n\n1403\n01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,970\nAnd it's got a block that sits\nright on top of your processor.\n\n1404\n01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,910\nAnd it's got an in and an out.\n\n1405\n01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:15,590\nSo, liquid comes in, runs over\nthe processor, and then goes out.\n\n1406\n01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:16,240\nAll right?\n\n1407\n01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,400\nIt then runs up here and\nthis is a radiator,\n\n1408\n01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,302\njust like in the front of your car,\nunless your car is air-cooled, I guess.\n\n1409\n01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:24,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a radiator that sits in the front\n\n1410\n01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,598\nof your car.\n\n1411\n01:08:25,598 --> 01:08:29,030\nAnd there in the front of your computer or\nback or whatever.\n\n1412\n01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,416\nIt sits somewhere in your computer.\n\n1413\n01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:34,814\nAnd it's a radiator and it's got a fan\nattached to it that's blowing air\n\n1414\n01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:39,369\nthrough that radiator to cool the liquid\ndown before it goes right back in.\n\n1415\n01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:40,567\nIt's a self-contained system.\n\n1416\n01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:44,189\nYou never add water to it,\nit just runs and does its job.\n\n1417\n01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:46,136\nAnd your computer sees\nit as if it's a fan, so\n\n1418\n01:08:46,136 --> 01:08:48,990\nit doesn't really even know\nthat it's liquid cooled.\n\n1419\n01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,213\nAnd you'll see they have\nmore advanced ones,\n\n1420\n01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:53,385\nlike the next level up\nfrom mine has two fans.\n\n1421\n01:08:53,385 --> 01:08:57,450\nOne that's pushing air, and\none that's pulling air to move it faster.\n\n1422\n01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,880\nJust getting more air through.\n\n1423\n01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,206\nAnd then you can go even higher where you\nget multiple fans if you're trying to cool\n\n1424\n01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,350\nsomething that generates a ton of heat.\n\n1425\n01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,510\nSo you can really do that.\n\n1426\n01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,624\nAnd this one has four fans.\n\n1427\n01:09:07,624 --> 01:09:08,950\nIs this when you start\nto go a little crazy.\n\n1428\n01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,710\nI don't want my computer to make\nnoise throughout the entire house,\n\n1429\n01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,270\nwhich is what some of these do.\n\n1430\n01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,710\nBut, these are inexpensive\nliquid cooling solutions.\n\n1431\n01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,581\nSo, if you're gonna be running your\ncomputer at very high process utilization\n\n1432\n01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:26,122\nlevels for long periods of time,\nthese can prolong the life of your CPU.\n\n1433\n01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:28,670\nThey can keep it cooler,\nwhich will make it last long longer.\n\n1434\n01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,750\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe different techniques for cooling PC's.\n\n1435\n01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,330\nThere are plenty of other ones.\n\n1436\n01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,800\nSome people make what\nthey call a submerged PC,\n\n1437\n01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,016\nwhere the entire motherboard is submerged\nin liquid, there's ways to do that.\n\n1438\n01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:45,188\nBut from your average user it's\ngoing to be fans and heat sinks,\n\n1439\n01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:46,730\nthat's what we normally see.\n\n1440\n01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,142\nWhen we crack open a computer you buy\nfrom Dell or HP, it's gonna be fans and\n\n1441\n01:09:50,142 --> 01:09:52,440\nheat sinks,\nit's not gonna be liquid cooled.\n\n1442\n01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,490\nIf you build your own computer, though,\n\n1443\n01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,030\nit's kind of fun to throw\nin a liquid cooler.\n\n1444\n01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,890\nIt's neat.\n\n1445\n01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,830\nI don't know, like mine,\nI spent 80 bucks on it.\n\n1446\n01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,988\nI don't know that it was 80\nbucks well spent, except for\n\n1447\n01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,291\nthe fact that I get to say, hey,\nI got a liquid cooled system.\n\n1448\n01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:04,592\nIt's kind of fun.\n\n1449\n01:10:04,592 --> 01:10:06,915\nBut it is available.\n\n1450\n01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,752\n>> Yeah, and a lot of times,\nthe noise factor too, right?\n\n1451\n01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:14,316\nAnd instead of a fan constantly spinning\nup too loud, most of these liquid cool\n\n1452\n01:10:14,316 --> 01:10:18,780\nsystems actually run nice and quiet and\nmakes it a nice environment, yeah.\n\n1453\n01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,890\n>> That is one thing that I\nworried about when I first got it,\n\n1454\n01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,600\nbecause you can't tell it's running.\n\n1455\n01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,511\nIt's silent.\n\n1456\n01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:24,602\nAnd there's the fan.\n\n1457\n01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:26,621\nSo I can look and\nsee if the fan is spinning,\n\n1458\n01:10:26,621 --> 01:10:30,512\nbut I don't actually know whether the pump\nis running, because I don't hear it.\n\n1459\n01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:31,464\nBut that is really nice.\n\n1460\n01:10:31,464 --> 01:10:35,858\nIt's silent and I don't have to worry\nabout things like dust getting into the PC\n\n1461\n01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:37,049\nand jamming that up.\n\n1462\n01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:38,780\nWhen you have a fan\nright on your processor.\n\n1463\n01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,925\nYou don't necessarily see it,\ncuz, it's closed in the case.\n\n1464\n01:10:41,925 --> 01:10:43,745\nDust can get in there and\nthat fan can fail.\n\n1465\n01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:46,415\nAnd you'll know it because\nyour processor gets hot.\n\n1466\n01:10:46,415 --> 01:10:50,557\nIf your CPU gets too hot, you'll start\ngetting errors in your operating system.\n\n1467\n01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:54,965\nYou get random crashes, your system will\nkind of freeze while you're working on it.\n\n1468\n01:10:54,965 --> 01:10:58,705\nThose are symptoms that come about from\nhaving too much heat in your computer.\n\n1469\n01:10:58,705 --> 01:11:02,935\nAnd that can be caused by, well, genuine\nheat or it can be caused by dust and\n\n1470\n01:11:02,935 --> 01:11:05,200\ndebris blocking the fan operation.\n\n1471\n01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,380\nMost of your fans do have ball bearings\nin them and they fail over time.\n\n1472\n01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,110\nSo you'll probably have\nto replace a fan or\n\n1473\n01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,320\n2 in your life as you keep\na computer longer and longer.\n\n1474\n01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,109\n>> Yeah.\nNed also reminds us in our chat room,\n\n1475\n01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:19,135\nthat different applications.\n\n1476\n01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:22,432\nSo he talked about the idea of\na home PC system or a media center,\n\n1477\n01:11:22,432 --> 01:11:26,730\nwhich the cases are really small so\na liquid cool system may be the way to go.\n\n1478\n01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:29,390\n>> Yeah, or specialized processors.\n\n1479\n01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,576\nNate has a pfSense firewall,\nand I have one at home too.\n\n1480\n01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:35,463\nWhere it's a little firewall box,\nit's small,\n\n1481\n01:11:35,463 --> 01:11:39,724\nbut we're running full blown operating\nsystems in there, and for that,\n\n1482\n01:11:39,724 --> 01:11:44,150\nthe case is small, I wanted it to be\nsilent, so I didn't want a fan, right?\n\n1483\n01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:47,536\nAnd so on that one, I've got a heat\nsink on the processor and that's it.\n\n1484\n01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:51,850\nNow most processors these days wont deal\nwith that, but they make special ones.\n\n1485\n01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,940\nIntel has the Atom processors.\n\n1486\n01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,780\nOr there's the ARM processors\nthat we have in mobile phones.\n\n1487\n01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,930\nThey're designed to run\nmuch more energy efficient.\n\n1488\n01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,830\nThey're slower, but\nthey're more energy efficient, and\n\n1489\n01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,700\nthey don't need a huge cooling system.\n\n1490\n01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,509\nYou probably don't have\na fan in your phone.\n\n1491\n01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,675\nBut your phone probably runs\nat over at gigahertz in speed.\n\n1492\n01:12:09,675 --> 01:12:11,324\nIt's probably multicore, right?\n\n1493\n01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:12,995\nRonnie, your phone,\nyou have a quad core phone.\n\n1494\n01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,645\n>> I do.\n>> And\n\n1495\n01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:15,090\nit's like 1.4\n>> Four.\n\n1496\n01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,090\n>> Gigahertz.\n\n1497\n01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:16,933\nAnd, no fan.\n\n1498\n01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:17,470\n>> Nope.\n>> No,\n\n1499\n01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,920\nprobably not even a heat sink if\nyou were to pop it open, you know?\n\n1500\n01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,847\n>> I haven't tried.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1501\n01:12:21,847 --> 01:12:22,575\n>> I think we should do it right now,\n\n1502\n01:12:22,575 --> 01:12:23,893\nRonnie\n>> Yeah, we should, yeah.\n\n1503\n01:12:23,893 --> 01:12:24,614\n>> Let's just pop your phone open.\n\n1504\n01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:25,311\n>> Yeah, that sounds great.\n\n1505\n01:12:25,311 --> 01:12:26,724\n>> So [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1506\n01:12:26,724 --> 01:12:28,390\n>> But they're just more energy efficient.\n\n1507\n01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,900\nAnd then if you're planning for\nbattery life and stuff in a phone.\n\n1508\n01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,160\nSo they can be very efficient.\n\n1509\n01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,020\nBut, in PCs, they keep the cost\ndown by not being efficient.\n\n1510\n01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,170\nAnd so, you have larger PCs,\nyou have room for\n\n1511\n01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:41,770\nall this cooling equipment and\nit works just fine.\n\n1512\n01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,440\nAll right, so that's pretty much it for\nour internal components.\n\n1513\n01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,930\nWe didn't go particularly deep\ninto any single device there.\n\n1514\n01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:54,200\nIf you wanna learn more,\nbe sure to check out our A+ show.\n\n1515\n01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,830\nWe dive into each one of these,\nwe show all

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,769\nWelcome back to another episode of\nITPro TV I'm your host Don Pizett,\n\n5\n00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:42,580\nback again with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,290\n>> It's going well today we're doing\na new segment on our security for\n\n7\n00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,040\nIT Fundamentals, and\nwe're ready to get started,\n\n8\n00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,235\ncuz this is kinda a neat area for us.\n\n9\n00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:57,030\n>> Yeah, for coming to IT fundamentals,\nit's basic computer skills right?\n\n10\n00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,600\nAnd basic IT skills in general, but\n\n11\n00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,380\nsecurity has been such a high visibility\ntopic over the last few years that CompTIA\n\n12\n00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,810\nwanted make sure that everyone at least\nhad a basic level of security training.\n\n13\n00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,580\nNow, we're not gonna gonna go crazy,\nCompTIA has the Security+,\n\n14\n00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,120\nand the CASP certifications that are for\npeople that are,\n\n15\n00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,530\nare going to become security\nprofessionals, that's your job.\n\n16\n00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,010\nBut, in any IT position you need to at\n\n17\n00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,700\nleast have a basic understanding of\nthe threats and things that are out there,\n\n18\n00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,540\nand the best practices we can use to\nprotect ourselves from those threats.\n\n19\n00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,270\nIt really is every employee's\nresponsibility to improve security\n\n20\n00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,290\norganization, everybody plays a part.\n\n21\n00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,330\nSo, we're gonna cover\nsome of the basics here,\n\n22\n00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,340\nsome of the different things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n23\n00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,190\nAnd you can expect to see\na good bit of this on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,640\nWhen we look at the exam objectives,\n\n25\n00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,820\nthis one has one of the higher\npercentage numbers.\n\n26\n00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,560\nAnd, actually, do I have that pulled up?\n\n27\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560\nI might even have that\npulled up somewhere.\n\n28\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,590\nLet's see if I've got that I believe\nthis is 21%, isn't it Ronnie?\n\n29\n00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,420\n>> It is, yep,\nthis is our third domain objective and\n\n30\n00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,250\nit is 21% of the overall exam, so that\nmeans you do get a few questions on this\n\n31\n00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,480\nprobably more than you'll actually\nsee on what did we just cover?\n\n32\n00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,885\nHardware is what we discovered now\nis a little bit less but not much.\n\n33\n00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,485\nBut security, because it is such\na wide-ranging field day and\n\n34\n00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:14,445\neverybody has to deal with it, we wanna\nmake sure that we at least understand,\n\n35\n00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:18,285\nwhat we're gonna be facing and some of the\nways that we can help defend ourselves?\n\n36\n00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,885\n>> All right.\nSo in this episode,\n\n37\n00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:26,730\nwe're gonna be diving into Objective 3.1\nand that is Define Basic Security Threats.\n\n38\n00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,420\nIf you're gonna protect yourself\nfrom various attacks, and\n\n39\n00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,250\nvulnerabilities, you need to\nbe aware of what they are.\n\n40\n00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,610\nSo what are the most common attacks that\nwe're subject to in an organization?\n\n41\n00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,870\nAnd you'd be surprised,\nthat the answer is not Chinese hackers or\n\n42\n00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,940\nwhatever the news would\nlead us to believe.\n\n43\n00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,430\nMost of the time the vulnerabilities\nthat you're exposed to are ones\n\n44\n00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,620\nthat happen inside of your organization,\nnot from outside at all.\n\n45\n00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,630\nSo we need to keep an open mind,\n\n46\n00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,620\nabout all the different places\nthat an attack can come from.\n\n47\n00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,770\nAnd that's what this section is all about.\n\n48\n00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,235\nSo, let's dive into that, we're gonna\nstart with a pretty neat one here.\n\n49\n00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:05,930\nSo, our official objective is 3.1\ndefine basic security threats.\n\n50\n00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,270\nAnd the first threat that comes\nto is Malware, all right?\n\n51\n00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,810\nSo, what is malware?\n\n52\n00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n53\n00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,270\nMalware for us today is an umbrella term,\nthat we get to use.\n\n54\n00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,150\nat one time, everybody used to\nsay everything that ever happened\n\n55\n00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,560\non the computer itself was a virus.\n\n56\n00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,210\nRegardless of what technically\nit really was it became a virus.\n\n57\n00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,870\nAnd then, we now have another term that\nwe call malware which means malicious\n\n58\n00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,080\nsoftware, so it's like a short\nversion of malicious software, and\n\n59\n00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,500\nthis of course includes\nthings like viruses.\n\n60\n00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,110\nAs well as what we call trojans and\nspyware and anything else that you can\n\n61\n00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,500\nthink of but it's just another way for us\nto categorize all these different terms.\n\n62\n00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,040\n>> Yeah, a malware deep down,\nit's software and, it may not be a virus.\n\n63\n00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,860\nIt may be something that you\neven installed yourself, but\n\n64\n00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,180\nmalware is doing things that you don't\nwant or that you don't know about.\n\n65\n00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,920\nSo, software that reports your to your\nlocation, or logs your keystrokes and\n\n66\n00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,860\nreports those to an external\nserver without you being aware,\n\n67\n00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,550\nthat kind of stuff is what malware does.\n\n68\n00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,500\nIt may not even be something that you see,\n\n69\n00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,140\nit may be just invisible\nin the background.\n\n70\n00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,085\nFor example, your computer could\nbe sending out spam emails, and\n\n71\n00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,255\nyou don't even know it.\n\n72\n00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:20,085\nYou may be experiencing a slower.\n\n73\n00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,425\nLike, your computer's just a little slower\nthan it's used to, or that you're used to.\n\n74\n00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,415\nBut, at the end of the day,\nit's this malware,\n\n75\n00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,545\nthis malicious software\nthat's in the background.\n\n76\n00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:31,315\nNow, inside of malware,\nthere are a ton of divisions.\n\n77\n00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,805\nAnd Ronny, you mentioned several of them.\n\n78\n00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,370\nLet's start with the big one, a virus.\n\n79\n00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,670\nNow that term, computer virus,\nis a very old term.\n\n80\n00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,220\nI, was it coined in the 80s or?\n\n81\n00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,770\n>> It was, yeah.\n\n82\n00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,990\nIt, it's strange,\nwhen we talk about the history of a virus,\n\n83\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,495\nit really came from an eighth grader, of\nall the places that it actually came from.\n\n84\n00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,910\nAn eighth grader was trying to impress\na girl, and was able, through that little\n\n85\n00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:58,185\ntiny computer network, to be able to\nget that person to run a disc that then\n\n86\n00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,520\ncuz a message to flash up on the screen,\nand that was supposed to be impressive.\n\n87\n00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,700\nAnd that was really one of the first\nrecorded cases that they believe was\n\n88\n00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,280\nan actual virus that was able to happen.\n\n89\n00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,010\nFrom that point, it is has now\nevolved into more malicious things and\n\n90\n00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,010\nsending a little lovesick,\na little love note pass message.\n\n91\n00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,258\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n92\n00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:19,010\nso a virus is just a program\nthat runs on your computer,\n\n93\n00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,250\nusually invisible, one that you don't see.\n\n94\n00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,990\nAnd it's not truly invisible,\n\n95\n00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,130\nthe operating system is aware, it's\nfunctioning in the OS, but they usually\n\n96\n00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,960\nhave things built into them to make it\nwhere you can't tell that they're running.\n\n97\n00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,670\nAnd one of the primary\ncharacteristics of a virus,\n\n98\n00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,500\nis that it's able to propagate itself.\n\n99\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,330\nIt's able to spread.\n\n100\n00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,320\nAnd the early viruses, the ones\nthat were written back in the 80s,\n\n101\n00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,760\nmost of them that's all they\ndid is they would spread.\n\n102\n00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,900\nThey wouldn't actually do much.\n\n103\n00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,080\nSome of them like the Michelangelo virus.\n\n104\n00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,120\nThat was one of the first ones\nto get national attention.\n\n105\n00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,150\nAnd it was a virus that would,\nit would infect your computer.\n\n106\n00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,270\nIt passed by floppy disk.\n\n107\n00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,990\nSo, you'd have an infected floppy disk,\nand on an infected computer,\n\n108\n00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,640\nany disk you put in would\nget the virus added.\n\n109\n00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,410\nAnd then you'd take that floppy disk and\ngo to another computer.\n\n110\n00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,090\nAnd when you plugged it in, that\ncomputer would then get infected also.\n\n111\n00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,580\nAnd the virus had a date hard coded in\nit that they said was Michelangelo's\n\n112\n00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,230\nbirthday, I think they debunked that,\nbut it was this one date per year, and\n\n113\n00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,700\non that date it would basically\nformat your hard drive.\n\n114\n00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,230\nIt would wipe out your data, and\nyour computer would be blank.\n\n115\n00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,990\nSo that was a very malicious virus,\nand it spread itself.\n\n116\n00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,100\nSome of them just spread, and\ndon't actually do anything.\n\n117\n00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,150\nIn today's world viruses\nare a lot different.\n\n118\n00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,970\nWhat you don't really profit from\nerasing somebody's hard drive?\n\n119\n00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,520\nYou just do that to be mean.\n\n120\n00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,170\nToday's viruses often times\nare generating somebody profit.\n\n121\n00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,470\nThey're installing advertising software on\nyour computer, or sending spam emails that\n\n122\n00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,510\nare selling Viagra or whatever and,\nso they're making money.\n\n123\n00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,030\nIt's a financial enterprise.\n\n124\n00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,650\nSo there's an entire criminal\nelement on the internet that\n\n125\n00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,550\nis generating millions upon millions\nof dollars every single month\n\n126\n00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,010\nthrough the use of viruses to\ndistribute their software.\n\n127\n00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,000\nSo that's a big deal.\n\n128\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,860\nAnd they've gotten a lot more advanced,\nand complex over the years.\n\n129\n00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,880\nBut at its heart, a virus that's\nsimply software that you don't want,\n\n130\n00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,070\nthat's gotten itself installed and is able\nto propagate itself to other systems.\n\n131\n00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,360\nAll right.\n\n132\n00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,170\nThe second one we've got\non our list is a Trojan.\n\n133\n00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,470\nAnd a Trojan, that's just an illusion\nto the Trojan horse right.\n\n134\n00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> The old, Athenian tale or something.\n\n135\n00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,160\n>> Yeah.\nThe Greek and Trojan war if you remember\n\n136\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,620\nthat little tiny tail there, of course\nonce they thought everybody was defeated,\n\n137\n00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,470\nthey saw this gift outside the gate,\na G-I-F-T.\n\n138\n00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,550\nAnd they were able to pull that horse\ninside, everybody inside the gates got\n\n139\n00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,680\ndrunk to the point where they\ncouldn't stand up anymore.\n\n140\n00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,870\nAnd then out came all of these\nsoldiers that killed everybody inside.\n\n141\n00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,870\nSo I always thought it was.\n\n142\n00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,350\nI was like, why would anybody ever\nname some malicious software this?\n\n143\n00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,167\nBut, it was because it was a gift.\n\n144\n00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,389\nAnd originally,\n\n145\n00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,792\nthat's how it first started was\na little image that was a .gif.\n\n146\n00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,585\nYou know, I, I now find that\nit's called a GIF, officially.\n\n147\n00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,375\nBut, people would just\nsay that it was GIFT, and\n\n148\n00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,110\nso it appeared on your computer and\nthere it goes, yeah.\n\n149\n00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,430\n>> Where you see trojans a lot\nis with stolen software.\n\n150\n00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,150\nAnd now, that's not the only place that\nit comes with, but it is very common.\n\n151\n00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,580\nMost of us know that if you want\nsomething like Microsoft Office,\n\n152\n00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,200\nyou can go to the store and\nyou can buy it.\n\n153\n00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,980\nAnd if you buy it, you get the software,\nand you're able to run it and\n\n154\n00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980\ndo updates and all that stuff.\n\n155\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,940\nBut if you don't want to pay, you can go\nto illegal websites on the internet and\n\n156\n00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,560\nyou can download bootleg\ncopies of Microsoft Office.\n\n157\n00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,230\nYou could do that, but\none of the things that happens is,\n\n158\n00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,580\nwhoever's packaging that software,\nthey know people are going to download it.\n\n159\n00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,975\nThey know that the people are,\n\n160\n00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,485\nare already accepting certain illegal\nbehaviors by bootlegging that software.\n\n161\n00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:47,700\nAnd so, they will then attach\nother files to it, a virus.\n\n162\n00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,390\nAnd, what you're doing is you're\ndownloading that bootleg copy of software.\n\n163\n00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,480\nAnd when you install it on your computer,\n\n164\n00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,660\nyou yourself are installing\nthe virus on the computer.\n\n165\n00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,140\nYou think you're getting program A, and\nthen the program is probably there.\n\n166\n00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,340\nBut, you're also getting\nTrojan B packaged along with it.\n\n167\n00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,710\nNow, your computer's infected\nwhich you willfully did yourself.\n\n168\n00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,520\nAnd now, you've got a virus, and\nyour system is now gonna try and\n\n169\n00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,870\nrepeat the process.\n\n170\n00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,765\nYou see this on like BitTorrent websites,\nand, all, all the file sharing,\n\n171\n00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,625\nthe peer to peer stuff like,\neDonkey and all those guys.\n\n172\n00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,975\nYou'll see files that'll say they are one\nprogram, and you download them and\n\n173\n00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,565\nthey're something completely different.\n\n174\n00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,015\nSo, those are trojans.\n\n175\n00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,685\nThat's not the only example.\n\n176\n00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:33,695\nYou might go to a website, and maybe it,\nit looks like the website you intended.\n\n177\n00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,505\nBut, you put a little typo in there, and\n\n178\n00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,040\nso you actually went to\na different website.\n\n179\n00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,120\nAnd, whoever set it up makes it\nlook like the one you went to.\n\n180\n00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,110\nBut when you go to download software,\nyou're actually downloading the software\n\n181\n00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,080\nthey've injec,\ninjected malicious stuff into.\n\n182\n00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,310\nAnd that, that's, it's tough, you know?\n\n183\n00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,970\nWe've gotta be able to pay attention\nto that to tell whether or\n\n184\n00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,860\nnot we're actually on a,\na correct place's website.\n\n185\n00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,260\nBut, the best way to deal with this is to\nonly download software from websites you\n\n186\n00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,870\ntrust, right?\n\n187\n00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,600\nFrom, from companies that\nare reputable and, and so on.\n\n188\n00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330\nIf you're out there doing BitTorrent,\n\n189\n00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,010\nyou don't know where your\nstuff is coming from.\n\n190\n00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,170\nPeople all over the world, and\nthey could easily tamper with those files.\n\n191\n00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,690\nIt's very, very common.\n\n192\n00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,890\nSo, a trojan is probably one of\nthe more dangerous ones because\n\n193\n00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,200\nwhen you install it, you're installing\nthe software, your operating system,\n\n194\n00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,020\nbe it Mac, or Windows, or Linux.\n\n195\n00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,460\nWe'll say, oh, you gotta have elevated\nprivileges to install the software,\n\n196\n00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,740\nyou need to be an administrator.\n\n197\n00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,370\nAnd, what do we do?\n\n198\n00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,910\nWe say, well,\nwe're installing software, yes.\n\n199\n00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,320\nAnd now, we've just given that trojan\n\n200\n00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,710\nadministrative privileges to do\nwhatever it wants on your computer.\n\n201\n00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,743\nAnd now, your machine is infected.\n\n202\n00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:41,126\nSo, those are really nasty because\nwe give them the permissions.\n\n203\n00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:41,626\n>> Yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,767\nOur next section, or\n\n205\n00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:48,870\nour next little topic here on the malware\nis gonn be one that we call spyware.\n\n206\n00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,630\nNow spyware, and you might also hear\nthe term adware a lot of times,\n\n207\n00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,350\nkinda combine together is,\nis our next little, little piece here.\n\n208\n00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,070\nAnd on both these, these are a little\nbit harder to distinguish, Don,\n\n209\n00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,680\nbetween spyware and adware.\n\n210\n00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,170\n>> Well, you know, adware was kinda first.\n\n211\n00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,510\nAnd with adware, it just makes\nadvertisements pop-up on your computer.\n\n212\n00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,760\nAnd, we used to see this all the time\nwhere somebody would say, man,\n\n213\n00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,270\nwhen im browsing the web,\nI will all of a sudden see,\n\n214\n00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,410\nhey, you won a free meal at Red Lobster.\n\n215\n00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,990\nThese things pop-up.\n\n216\n00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,620\nAnd, they were going to websites they\nknew didn't have advertisements,\n\n217\n00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,400\nand getting these,\nthese ads that would pop up.\n\n218\n00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,660\nAnd, that's one of the first indicators\nthat your machine is infected.\n\n219\n00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,600\nWhen you're seeing advertising popped up,\nand\n\n220\n00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,360\nyou're on a site like,\nlike take Google, for example.\n\n221\n00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,920\nGoogle's homepage.\n\n222\n00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,700\nVery, very spartan.\n\n223\n00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,010\nIt has their logo,\nit has the search box, and that's it.\n\n224\n00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,000\nThere's no ads on Google's homepage.\n\n225\n00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,950\n>> So, if you go their homepage and also\nyou see an ad, where did that come from?\n\n226\n00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,670\nWell, adware installed on\nthe background of that machine.\n\n227\n00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,090\nNow, they make money,\nwhen you click on that ad.\n\n228\n00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,210\nIf you do, you say woah,\nred lobster, I love that.\n\n229\n00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,956\nI wanna click on them.\n\n230\n00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,875\nNever, actually eaten there.\n\n231\n00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,435\nBut anyhow, so then you click on it.\n\n232\n00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,675\nAnd now, you're, you're browsing somewhere\nand they get a pay per click, right?\n\n233\n00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,735\nThey, they earned a penny\nwhen you clicked on that.\n\n234\n00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,055\nBut, they're distributing this\nto millions of people, so\n\n235\n00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,380\nthose pennies add up pretty fast.\n\n236\n00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,100\nWell, as time went on, those started\nto become a lot more advanced.\n\n237\n00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,740\nAnd, what happened is the pay per click\nmodel, that model of advertising,\n\n238\n00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,480\nkinda dried up.\n\n239\n00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,380\nYou can't make good money\ndoing pay per click anymore.\n\n240\n00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,370\nIt used to be that you could\nthrow these ads up, and\n\n241\n00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,100\nevery time somebody clicked on it,\nyou'd, you'd earn a, a penny.\n\n242\n00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,600\nGoogle, and other add companies kind of\npicked up on that, and now they filter for\n\n243\n00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,430\nit, and they don't make money doing that.\n\n244\n00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,035\nSo instead, what they do,\nis they harvest your demographics.\n\n245\n00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,165\nThey try and\nlearn as much as they can about you.\n\n246\n00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,025\nWhat email provider do you use?\n\n247\n00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,465\nHow old you are?\n\n248\n00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,235\nHow many emails per day do you send?\n\n249\n00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,195\nWhat websites do you visit?\n\n250\n00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,568\nAnd, they gather all of\nthat data into a database.\n\n251\n00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,455\nYou know, it's called user metadata.\n\n252\n00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,965\nAnd then, they take that data and\nthey resell it.\n\n253\n00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,865\nThey resell it to statistics firms and\n\n254\n00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,680\nother people who are looking to\nbuild up an email list, right?\n\n255\n00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,860\nIf I wanna send emails,\n\n256\n00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,150\na bunch of spam out,\nI need a valid list of emails to send to.\n\n257\n00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,490\nSo, that's the kind of\nstuff they reuse those for.\n\n258\n00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,400\nSo, they're spying on you.\n\n259\n00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000\nThey're gathering your information.\n\n260\n00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,840\nAnd, some of them are really insidious.\n\n261\n00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,230\nSome of them install key-logger, which\nmeans every time you touch the keyboard,\n\n262\n00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,290\nit writes that to a file and\nsends it off to servers somewhere else.\n\n263\n00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,530\n>> So now, not only do they know,\nyou know, what service you use for\n\n264\n00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,990\nyour email or what sites you visit.\n\n265\n00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,690\nThey also know what your passwords are,\nand everything you've typed.\n\n266\n00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,300\nSo if you typed an email message,\nthey see everything that you typed.\n\n267\n00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,060\nAnd, what are they going to do with that?\n\n268\n00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,320\nWell, they do all sorts of things.\n\n269\n00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,410\nYou hear about blackmail and extortion,\nand other, other activities like that.\n\n270\n00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,920\nSo, those are really bad.\n\n271\n00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,860\nAnd, it's just called spyware and\nit started out as just demographics,\n\n272\n00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,630\ngathering that metadata\nto help with advertising.\n\n273\n00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,830\nAnd now, it's turned more criminal.\n\n274\n00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,390\nWhat's our last one, Ronnie?\n\n275\n00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,940\nWe all wanna learn?\n\n276\n00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,770\n>> Our last one is, is ransomeware.\n\n277\n00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,880\nThis is, I don't want to say it's brand\nnew, but we're startin to see more and\n\n278\n00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,650\nmore of what we call ransomeware\nappearing ev, every day.\n\n279\n00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,290\n>> I think the big case\nthat I heard last year was\n\n280\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,470\none that happened in\nAustralia with iPhones.\n\n281\n00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,480\nSomebody woke up one day, and they went to\nswipe it and say, hey, if you want access\n\n282\n00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,890\nto your iPhone, you gotta send 100\ndollars or 150 dollars to this address.\n\n283\n00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,720\nAnd so now, they're able,\neven on your own device,\n\n284\n00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,950\nto lock it there until yes,\nyou do what they want you to do.\n\n285\n00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,700\nSome ransom.\n\n286\n00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,810\n>> Yeah, there's a few different forms of\nthis, and we are seeing these on our PCs.\n\n287\n00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,520\nIt really does prey up on people\nwho dont know any better.\n\n288\n00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,310\nAnd, what will happen is your\nmachine'll get infected, and\n\n289\n00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,840\nlet's say it's a desktop.\n\n290\n00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,500\nIt might lock up your entire screen,\nso you go to use the computer and\n\n291\n00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,600\nyou see a giant message saying,\nyou are unable to access your computer.\n\n292\n00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,514\n>> If you wanna access this again, you\ngotta go to this address and pay us money,\n\n293\n00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:48,320\nor, or\nsend us a Western Union wire transfer.\n\n294\n00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,440\nI, a lot of them are very\nspecific like that.\n\n295\n00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,290\nAnd, they'll ask for\na few hundred dollars.\n\n296\n00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,225\nAnd, if you don't know any better,\nwhat, what are you gonna do?\n\n297\n00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,545\nHey, these people have taken\ncontrol of my computer.\n\n298\n00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,065\nI've got to send them money, right?\n\n299\n00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,515\nNow, those are very obvious.\n\n300\n00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,325\nYour computer is being held hostage,\nand they're demanding a ransom.\n\n301\n00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,665\nThat's why its called a ransomware,\nall right.\n\n302\n00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:10,167\nBut, there's some that are a little\nless obvious like that, all right?\n\n303\n00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:14,135\nFor example, it might be phrased in a way\nto make it look like their helping you.\n\n304\n00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,928\nYou might see a message that says, hey,\n\n305\n00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:20,111\nyour computer's been infected by a virus,\nwhich is very true.\n\n306\n00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:23,913\n[LAUGH] And, you know,\nyou've been infected by a virus.\n\n307\n00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:29,340\nTo protect you, we have secured these\nfiles so that you can't access them.\n\n308\n00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,660\nAnd, it's you My Documents folder,\nall your documents.\n\n309\n00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,450\nSo, we've secured this, and\nwe can remove the virus.\n\n310\n00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,710\nWe can clean the virus for\nyou if you sign up for our service.\n\n311\n00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,870\nAnd, they'll have a link to a webpage.\n\n312\n00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,050\nAnd you go to this webpage,.and you pay\nthem money and they clean the virus.\n\n313\n00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,770\nWell, in the background what's\nreally happened is they've encrypted\n\n314\n00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,130\nall of your files, so\nyou can't access them.\n\n315\n00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,840\nYou can see them, but\nyou can't access the content.\n\n316\n00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,917\nSo now, those files are secured.\n\n317\n00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,333\nAnd when you go to the website and\npay, they're not cleaning them.\n\n318\n00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,210\nThey're just decrypting the files,\nand now you have access again.\n\n319\n00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,762\nSo, they're holding your files ransom\nEven though they're making it sound like\n\n320\n00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,000\nthey're doing you a favor.\n\n321\n00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500\nHey, we're protecting you.\n\n322\n00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,710\nHere's how you unlock it.\n\n323\n00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,110\nOur, our advanced anti-virus software,\nyou need this, right?\n\n324\n00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,570\nAnd the worst part is if they pay,\nif somebody pays,\n\n325\n00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,130\nthey'll unlock the files and then usually\nthey'll continue to do more things.\n\n326\n00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,280\nLike, would you like to\nprevent this in the future?\n\n327\n00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880\nYou should download our advanced product.\n\n328\n00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,340\nAnd they start plying for\nmore and more money.\n\n329\n00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,920\nAnd if you don't pay they just\nlock the stuff again, oh!\n\n330\n00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,490\nYou got infected again, see, you\nshould've bought our advanced software.\n\n331\n00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,434\nAnd, unfortunately for, for\nnon-IT people, for the elderly, you know,\n\n332\n00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:37,805\npeople who didn't grow up with computers\nit's not obvious what's going on and, and\n\n333\n00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:42,380\nthey, they, they fall for the trap, you\nknow, and, and it's very, very effective.\n\n334\n00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,605\nThere are many people that have succumbed\nto this one and i, i, i, it's really,\n\n335\n00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,250\nreally kind of insidious and\nthat's ransom ware.\n\n336\n00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,130\nIt is becoming more and more popular.\n\n337\n00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n338\n00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,600\nThese different types of malware,\n\n339\n00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,090\nwe're gonna see them just about daily in,\nin places that we end up you know,\n\n340\n00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,260\nwhen we work with people that\naren't really technical savvy.\n\n341\n00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,050\nA lot of times when people\nare brand new to computing and, and\n\n342\n00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,930\nthey click on anything that they see,\nyou'll probably see more and\n\n343\n00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,280\nmore of the malware on their computers.\n\n344\n00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,110\nBut just because they're actually doing\nthis doesn't mean that's all we're limited\n\n345\n00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,250\nto for some of the things we have\nto defend ourselves against.\n\n346\n00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,160\nThe next one I wanna talk about\nis what we call phishing.\n\n347\n00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,730\nNow I remember this one, Don.\n\n348\n00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,780\nOne of the very first\nemails that I was like,\n\n349\n00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,100\nwell that's, that looks a little bit\nfishy was one that I got that I was like,\n\n350\n00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,700\nwell they're telling me that I need to\nenter my bank account number in here.\n\n351\n00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,520\nAnd then I said but I don't even\nhave account there, Don, so, so\n\n352\n00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,540\nwhat's going on?\n\n353\n00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,392\n>> Yeah, that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n354\n00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:42,338\n>> That's gonna be phishing and it,\nit's spelled P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G, so\n\n355\n00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:45,256\nit's phishing with a, a P H\n>> And it's,\n\n356\n00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:48,130\nit's a form of social engineering.\n\n357\n00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,930\nIt's where somebody pretends\nto be a company that you,\n\n358\n00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,570\nyou do business with in an attempt\nto get your credentials.\n\n359\n00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,480\nAlright.\n\n360\n00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,457\nOne of the best examples of\nthat is you know, a, a bank.\n\n361\n00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:05,460\nI'd so, so let's say that I do business\nwith what's a good bank to use?\n\n362\n00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,780\nBank of America, right?\n\n363\n00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,091\nSo, so here in the US,\nthere's a bank called Bank of America, or\n\n364\n00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,250\nis it Nation's Bank?\n\n365\n00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,012\nBank of America, okay.\n\n366\n00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,990\nSo as they're a big bank here in the US,\n\n367\n00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,943\nI don't think they go outside of US\nvery much, but they're, they're here.\n\n368\n00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:21,105\nAnd if I have an account with them, great.\n\n369\n00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,785\nI get emails from them\noccasionally if I do.\n\n370\n00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,985\nI, I, I don't have an account with them.\n\n371\n00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,165\nBut, but any how so\nyou get emails from them.\n\n372\n00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:27,145\nAnd, and it's what you expect.\n\n373\n00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,385\nIt's got their banner at the top.\n\n374\n00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:29,315\nIt's from their address.\n\n375\n00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,045\nIt's got their information.\n\n376\n00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,930\nWell, I might receive an email one day.\n\n377\n00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,070\nThat looks like it's from Bank of America,\nand its says warning,\n\n378\n00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,010\nyour account may have been compromised,\nplease log in and change your password.\n\n379\n00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,565\nOr you know,\nplease log in to unlock your account or\n\n380\n00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:48,235\nyour account's been frozen, right?\n\n381\n00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:51,325\nIt will say something like that,\nsome call to action that\n\n382\n00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:55,365\nwill you make you wanna go to\na website and log in, all right?\n\n383\n00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:58,930\nAnd it'll have a nice big link,\nclick here to unlock your account,\n\n384\n00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,620\nclick here to change your password.\n\n385\n00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,660\nClick here to solve your problem,\nwhatever it is.\n\n386\n00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,610\nWhen you click on that link,\n\n387\n00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,400\nit may look like it's gonna\ntake you to Bank of America.\n\n388\n00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,450\nBut if you float your mouse over it and\nlook at the address it's sending to you,\n\n389\n00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:19,010\nit'll actually send you to who knows\nwhere, right, a server that they control,\n\n390\n00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,690\nthat you then browse to and it may look\njust like the Bank of America webpage.\n\n391\n00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,990\nAnd it has that username and\npassword blank.\n\n392\n00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,800\nAnd then you go to type in\nyour username and password.\n\n393\n00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,070\nWell what happens?\n\n394\n00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,990\nThey display a screen saying,\nall right, congratulations.\n\n395\n00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,460\nYour account's unlocked,\nyou know, you're safe.\n\n396\n00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,980\nOr you punch in your old password and\nyour new password to change it and\n\n397\n00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,120\nthey say, password changed, you're safe.\n\n398\n00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,240\nWell they didn't actually do\nanything on your real account, but\n\n399\n00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,780\nwhat they did is they just wrote down\nyour username and password, right?\n\n400\n00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,640\nThey've got it.\n\n401\n00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,430\nYou just gave them your username and\npassword.\n\n402\n00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,910\nSo you've gotta be really\ncareful about that.\n\n403\n00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,250\nAnd Google just released a report on this,\n\n404\n00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,520\nit was like yesterday,\nwhere they said that phishing attempts,\n\n405\n00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,930\nthe ones that actually make it to\nyour inbox are up to 45% effective.\n\n406\n00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,730\nThat means that almost half\nof them actually succeed, and\n\n407\n00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,510\nthat is a shocking number, right?\n\n408\n00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,880\nIn the IT industry,\nwe know to look for that.\n\n409\n00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,040\nWe know when you get that\nemail that it looks suspect.\n\n410\n00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,580\nWe know to check the link, but\nyour average user doesn't.\n\n411\n00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,880\nThey get this email telling them hey,\nyou've been compromised.\n\n412\n00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,110\nHere's what you need to do to fix it.\n\n413\n00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,984\nWho's not gonna do something to fix that,\nright?\n\n414\n00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:29,141\nAnd they click on that link and\nthen, then they're trapped.\n\n415\n00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:30,802\nYou know that it's, it's been taken.\n\n416\n00:20:30,802 --> 00:20:33,650\nSo you know, that stuff happens.\n\n417\n00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,830\nThat, you get these things.\n\n418\n00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,340\nThey, they look like\nit's a legitimate email.\n\n419\n00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,030\nAnd, and\nit turns out to be a a phishing attempt.\n\n420\n00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,970\nNow, they are really common and I,\nI'm scanning my spam box right now.\n\n421\n00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,290\nI was hoping to find one\nright here on the show.\n\n422\n00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,820\nI usually get at least one a day and\nit's funny because in your example,\n\n423\n00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,165\nRonnie, sometimes I'll get ones for\na bank I don't even work with.\n\n424\n00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,195\nOr my favorite is Facebook, right.\n\n425\n00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,746\nI'll get emails all the time telling\nme your Facebook account may have been\n\n426\n00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:04,027\ncompromised or your LinkedIn\naccount may have been compromised.\n\n427\n00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:06,372\nAnd I'll look at it and\nI go, jokes on you guys.\n\n428\n00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:07,372\nI don't have one.\n\n429\n00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:11,757\nSo, so, you know, to me it's no big deal\nbut to somebody who has Facebook and\n\n430\n00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:14,593\nthat's how they communicate\nwith their family,\n\n431\n00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:17,920\nthat sets off a panic and\nthey make bad decisions, right?\n\n432\n00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,135\nSo that's the problem.\n\n433\n00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,511\n[SOUND] See if I can find one.\n\n434\n00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:23,790\n>> Yeah, I, I remember this,\nDon, because I actually fell for\n\n435\n00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,776\na phishing attack in the,\nway back in like 2000, I think or 2001.\n\n436\n00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,584\nThere was a very popular chat program\ncalled ICQ, it might still be out there,\n\n437\n00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,260\nI haven't used it in years.\n\n438\n00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,345\nBut I was one of the first like\n100,000 people that were on that.\n\n439\n00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:36,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,266\n>> That ICQ, and then one day I got this\nmessage from ICQ saying hey your account\n\n441\n00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,510\nmay have been compromised,\nplease go and verify here.\n\n442\n00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,420\nAnd I thought oh, okay, no, no big deal.\n\n443\n00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,870\nI verified and then within a minute,\nmy account had been taken.\n\n444\n00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,700\nThat they had just logged in as me and\ntaken my account and changed my password.\n\n445\n00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,473\nAnd there it was, it was gone.\n\n446\n00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:55,413\n>> Yup.\n>> Yeah.\n\n447\n00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,273\n>> That's, that's how it works.\n\n448\n00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,813\nIt, it looks like something legitimate,\nand it turns out to, to not be.\n\n449\n00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,820\nSo you know, that's how these happen.\n\n450\n00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,903\nThat's how they get your information and,\nyou know I, I,\n\n451\n00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,800\nI feed all my email through Google,\nthrough Gmail, and\n\n452\n00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,212\nthey do a great job of filtering\nout the really well-known ones.\n\n453\n00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:12,781\n>> Yeah, they do.\n\n454\n00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:16,140\n>> And so as I'm scanning down,\nI'm actually not seeing any good ones.\n\n455\n00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,590\nBut you'll see all sorts of, of examples\nwhere it's just they say they're\n\n456\n00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,460\na company that you know you do business\nwith, but in actuality, it's not them.\n\n457\n00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,500\n>> Yeah, it's always amazing\nthe forms that these things take.\n\n458\n00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,220\nIf it's not something\nthat really scares you,\n\n459\n00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,020\nthen it's something that seems like\nit's a legitimate protection scheme,\n\n460\n00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,320\nlike what we were just talking\nabout a little bit earlier.\n\n461\n00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,660\nSo sometimes you might get one that\nsays the FBI is saying this warning,\n\n462\n00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,940\nplease come here to con, you know,\nto confirm that your account is safe.\n\n463\n00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,190\nEh, and then, you know, you get bought\nin by, you know, you buy that that lie.\n\n464\n00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,200\nAnd and\nthen that's what ends up happening.\n\n465\n00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,190\nA lot of elderly people get taken\nadvantage of in this very quickly and\n\n466\n00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,290\nvery easily because their kids buy a\ncomputer and say, oh, we can communicate.\n\n467\n00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,901\nAnd they get this warning and they think\nthat something has absolutely happened.\n\n468\n00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:04,504\n>> Yeah, that's a, i, it, you,\nyou can find all sorts of people with,\n\n469\n00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:08,190\nwith similar experiences to that and\nit's just, i, it is an epidemic.\n\n470\n00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,710\nA lot of email companies are taking\nsteps to help protect from this,\n\n471\n00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,389\nthey're checking for the scam attempts.\n\n472\n00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,600\nSometimes they catch them,\nsometimes they don't.\n\n473\n00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,440\nWhere they really become challenging\nis where you get specifically targeted.\n\n474\n00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,780\nA phishing attempt can\nbe just really general.\n\n475\n00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,540\nMaybe they made this Bank\nof America notice and\n\n476\n00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,780\nthen just send to everybody\nthey can think of, knowing that\n\n477\n00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,740\nmost people won't have an account there\nbut some people will and there they go.\n\n478\n00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,150\nOther times they might be\ntargeting you specifically.\n\n479\n00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,252\nIf I wanted to target Ronnie,\n\n480\n00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:42,170\nall right, I know Ronnie,\nI know that he's Microsoft-certified.\n\n481\n00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,529\nSo if I wanna get him\nwith a phishing attempt,\n\n482\n00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,583\nI can craft an email that looks\nlike it's from Microsoft.\n\n483\n00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,338\nAnd I could say,\nyour certification is up for renewal,\n\n484\n00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:52,920\nclick here to find the process to renew.\n\n485\n00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,000\nAnd then it takes him to a page and says\nplease log in with your Windows Live ID.\n\n486\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,377\nSo if he were to click that link,\nhe would, he would know, or\n\n487\n00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:02,910\nhe might not know, right, and go to this\nwebsite and punch in the credentials.\n\n488\n00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,840\nIf you specifically craft it to target one\nperson, most of the email services will\n\n489\n00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,350\nnot be able to catch that, and\nthat is where the real effectiveness is.\n\n490\n00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n491\n00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,640\nJames actually calls us\nout in our chatroom.\n\n492\n00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,870\nHe calls it spear phishing.\n\n493\n00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,460\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And that's exactly what it is,\n\n494\n00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,870\nbecause it is targeting that, that\nvery limited, target audience or that,\n\n495\n00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,969\neven, you know that one person.\n\n496\n00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,320\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, and\n\n497\n00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,690\nI, I really,\nthis is one of those times where,\n\n498\n00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,310\nwhere Google is more effective than\nyou necessarily want it to be.\n\n499\n00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,170\nBut yeah,\nI I can not seem to find a good one.\n\n500\n00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,250\nBut you, you'll see them from\nall sorts of different sources.\n\n501\n00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so let's see.\n\n502\n00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,380\nWhat is next on our agenda?\n\n503\n00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,470\nThat was, that was phishing.\n\n504\n00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,720\nAnd let's let's cover just one more and\nthen we'll stop for a break.\n\n505\n00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> The next one's actually\n\n506\n00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,740\na pretty big one,\nwhich is social engineering.\n\n507\n00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,360\nAll right?\n\n508\n00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,880\nPhishing is technically\na type of social engineering.\n\n509\n00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,900\nI think I used that term a moment ago.\n\n510\n00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,450\nAnd social engineering is probably\nthe most effective form of attack.\n\n511\n00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,530\nBecause social engineering\ndoesn't focus on your computer,\n\n512\n00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,760\ndoesn't focus on a program or an\napplication, it focuses on a person, and\n\n513\n00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,550\nin IT security, it's the person,\nthe employee, that's the weakest link.\n\n514\n00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,530\nNo matter how great your firewall is,\nand, and\n\n515\n00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,331\nhow high the encryption is set on\nyour VPN concentrator, and, and\n\n516\n00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:22,950\nall that, It doesn't matter if you got\na mail room clerk, or a secretary,\n\n517\n00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,250\nan assistant, or whatever who just\ndoesn't care about security, and\n\n518\n00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,630\nsocial engineering preys on that.\n\n519\n00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,260\nA great example of this\nis a phone call that's\n\n520\n00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,480\nstructured very similar to\na phising attempt, all right.\n\n521\n00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,750\nAnd I've, I've done these as part\nof audits before, and they're,\n\n522\n00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,170\nthey're scarily effective.\n\n523\n00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,790\nIf you want to get into a company,\nyou want to gain access to their network,\n\n524\n00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,050\nit'd be so much easier if you had\na valid username and a password.\n\n525\n00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,830\nBecause then you could\njust walk right through.\n\n526\n00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,030\nYou could log in to their systems.\n\n527\n00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,100\nYou wouldn't have to hack anything.\n\n528\n00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,580\nYou got a username and password.\n\n529\n00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,830\nSo, what you do is you call\nsomebody in the company.\n\n530\n00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,130\nDoesn't matter who.\nYou can call anybody in the company.\n\n531\n00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,170\nAnd you can say, just you call them up,\nand you say hey this is Don, I'm\n\n532\n00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,060\nwith the IT department, and we've noticed\nsome suspicious activity on the network.\n\n533\n00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,280\nWe think that your computer\nmight actually be compromised.\n\n534\n00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,170\nSo we're looking into it now,\nbut, can you do me a favor?\n\n535\n00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,470\nI need you to verify your username and\npassword just so\n\n536\n00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,659\nI can ensure that your\naccount hasn't been changed.\n\n537\n00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,250\nAnd then the person on the other end,\nif they don't know any better, if they say\n\n538\n00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,990\nwell, it's the help desk, it's okay to\ntell the help desk my password right?\n\n539\n00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,770\nAnd then they say my username is\n[INAUDIBLE] and my password is,\n\n540\n00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,150\nyou know, spaceballs1234 and\nthat's my password, punch it in.\n\n541\n00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,890\nAnd so then the, you know, the person\ndoing the social engineering says, all\n\n542\n00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,364\nright well, you know actually It checks\nout, so I'm gonna reactivate your account.\n\n543\n00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:44,330\nLooks like everything's okay,\n\n544\n00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,810\nbut can you let me know if you spot\nany suspicious activity after this.\n\n545\n00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,430\nYa know, just email the help desk or\nwhatever.\n\n546\n00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,430\nAnd they'll say okay and hang up, right?\n\n547\n00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,250\nSo now the end user,\nthe person who just got hacked basically.\n\n548\n00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,300\nThat person is gonna be on the lookout for\nsuspicious activity after that.\n\n549\n00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,630\nBut they think everything's fine.\n\n550\n00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,670\nNow their account still works just like\nthey expect, but their username and\n\n551\n00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,270\npassword have just been compromised.\n\n552\n00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,100\nRight.\nAnd\n\n553\n00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,800\nnow the attacker doesn't have\nto hack the network anymore.\n\n554\n00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,430\nThey can walk right in,\ncuz they got valid user credentials, and\n\n555\n00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,880\nthat's what social engineering is all\nabout, and it is extremely easy to pull\n\n556\n00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,590\noff, because most people don't think\nabout verifying caller ID, right\n\n557\n00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,710\nverifying the person on the other end,\nnot giving your passwords to help desk.\n\n558\n00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,340\nRight?\n\n559\n00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,857\nNot giving your password to anybody that\ncalls you, but only giving your password\n\n560\n00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:36,572\nto people that you call, simple procedures\nlike that defeat this type of attack, but\n\n561\n00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,023\nit is incredibly effective and almost all\nof the major newsworthy hacks that have\n\n562\n00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:45,360\noccurred in the last several years have\nall started with social engineering.\n\n563\n00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,408\n>> You know, it's amazing how the,\n\n564\n00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:52,668\nthe appearance of you needing help is\nan incredible social engineering attack.\n\n565\n00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:56,440\nThere was one time I was having to carry\nsomething heavy and there was a door that\n\n566\n00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,000\nI had to go through and it said all\nvisitors must use the main entrance.\n\n567\n00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,650\nWell, I was carrying this heavy set\nof books and I had my bag with me and\n\n568\n00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,860\nI looked like I was struggling and\nI simply walked up to the door and\n\n569\n00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,810\nthere was somebody walking in,\nabout to clock in for work.\n\n570\n00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:15,080\nThey simply held the door open for me,\neven though right on the door it said\n\n571\n00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,950\nvisitors must report to the front,\nyou know, use the front, simply oh,\n\n572\n00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,500\nyou can come in this way and\njust allowed me in.\n\n573\n00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,780\nJust held the door open for me.\n\n574\n00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,580\nIt's amazing how easy that works.\n\n575\n00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,230\n>> You know Dave in\nthe chatroom mentioned,\n\n576\n00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,440\nbasically a phishing attack where,\nwhere they say they're the FBI and\n\n577\n00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,400\nthey'll help you recover funds\nthat you lost in a 419 scam.\n\n578\n00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,500\nNow that, that's really,\nreally a dirty trick right there.\n\n579\n00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,980\nA 419 scam we usually call\nthese like Nigerian 419 scams.\n\n580\n00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,020\nThere are a series of email scams\nthat have been going on for.\n\n581\n00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,000\n>> 20 years.\n\n582\n00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,630\nJust about.\n>> Yeah.\n\n583\n00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,230\nI mean a long time.\n\n584\n00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,830\nWhere you'll get an email and\nit'll say I'm an attorney or\n\n585\n00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,860\nan estate process or some member of\nthe government of the country of Nigeria.\n\n586\n00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,340\nAnd a certain official,\n\n587\n00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,560\nI've seen prince, kings\n>> Yeah.\n\n588\n00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,410\n>> I've seen other,\nyou know, CEOs or whatever.\n\n589\n00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,811\nSome, somebody wealthy has died, and\n\n590\n00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:12,510\nthey had $28 million in their bank\naccount, or $50 million, or whatever.\n\n591\n00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,630\nAnd they want to get this money out,\nbut because of the rules and\n\n592\n00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,530\nregulations, they can't do it.\n\n593\n00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,520\nSo they need somebody to help.\n\n594\n00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,220\nThey need somebody outside\nof the country to help.\n\n595\n00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,310\nAnd if you will allow them to\ntransfer these millions of dollars\n\n596\n00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,670\ninto your bank account and\nyou promise to transfer back to them, thus\n\n597\n00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,030\ngetting around their loop hole, they'll\nlet you keep a million dollars, right?\n\n598\n00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,000\nAnd so people look at this like, wait a\nminute, you're going to send me a bunch of\n\n599\n00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,370\nmoney and all I have to do is\nsend most of it back to you,\n\n600\n00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,520\nthere's no risk there,\nwhy wouldn't I do that right?\n\n601\n00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,950\nAnd so, you start to do it, and they say,\n\n602\n00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,400\nwell, we need to verify\nthat your account is valid.\n\n603\n00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,310\nSo we need you to send a wire transfer.\n\n604\n00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,720\nCan you send this amount of dollars,\nand then,\n\n605\n00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,410\nwhat we'll do is use that to send the,\nthe millions back.\n\n606\n00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,570\nAnd then they'll start stringing you\nalong, asking for a little more money for\n\n607\n00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,690\nthis, a little more money for that.\n\n608\n00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,630\nOh there's some paperwork\nthat has to be filled out.\n\n609\n00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,760\nThere's a $50 stamp fee and so on.\n\n610\n00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,590\nAnd basically you end up sending them\nmoney and they never send you a dime.\n\n611\n00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,580\nThose are 419 scams.\n\n612\n00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,390\nThey've been around a long time.\n\n613\n00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,480\nYou see them on Craigslist now\nin a slightly different form.\n\n614\n00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,520\nYou're selling something on Craigslist,\nright.\n\n615\n00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,280\nMaybe you're selling a car for $5,000.\n\n616\n00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,839\nAnd somebody emails you sight unseen and\nsays, I want to buy your car, but\n\n617\n00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,970\nI got pre-approved by my, by my bank and\nthey gave me a check for $7,000.\n\n618\n00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,150\nSo can I send you the $7,000 check and you\njust send me back the difference, alright?\n\n619\n00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,430\nYour car is 5,000d, you just send\nme the 2,000 back, all right?\n\n620\n00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,410\nAnd they send you the check.\n\n621\n00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,836\nSight unseen, they didn't see your car,\nthey send you the check, and you,\n\n622\n00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:47,917\nyou receive it, and you go to deposit\nit in your bank, and meanwhile,\n\n623\n00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:51,240\nyou cut a $2,000 check and\nsend it back to them, all right.\n\n624\n00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,140\nWell, meanwhile, their check bounces.\n\n625\n00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,940\nTheir check isn't, isn't invalid.\n\n626\n00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,370\nBut you sent $2,000 to them, right?\n\n627\n00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,960\nThat's part of, of a 419 scam.\n\n628\n00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,330\nAnd they, they're really prevalent,\nyou know?\n\n629\n00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,070\nIt is a big problem that's out there.\n\n630\n00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,650\nSo, that's bad enough, but then when\nsomebody does a phishing attempt saying,\n\n631\n00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,260\nhey, we noticed you lost money\nin one of these scams and\n\n632\n00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,740\nwe can help you recover it.\n\n633\n00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,378\nAnd now that's just even more, right?\n\n634\n00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:16,898\n[LAUGH] That's like insult to injury,\nthat's dirtiness.\n\n635\n00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:22,110\nBut those are, those are very real\nthings and it preys on people, right.\n\n636\n00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,210\nThat's what social engineering does and\nit's incredibly easy, you know.\n\n637\n00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,490\nI think we all probably did prank\nphone calls in, in high school,\n\n638\n00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,600\nwhere you said you were the AC repair man,\nis your refrigerator running?\n\n639\n00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,670\nYou better go and catch it, whatever.\n\n640\n00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,320\nSo, maybe not maybe I was lame.\n\n641\n00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,431\nBut so, so that, I mean, that's really\nan early form of social engineering so\n\n642\n00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:44,292\nit's [INAUDIBLE] that's out there.\n\n643\n00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:48,192\nWell Ronny we've been having too much fun\nthis segment, we shot over our time limit\n\n644\n00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:51,866\nso let's stop and take a break and when\nwe get back, We've got a few more attack\n\n645\n00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:55,680\ntypes to talk about and, you know, just\na couple of little prevention methods.\n\n646\n00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,106\nIt's, it's really not hard to protect\nfrom this stuff if you're just aware, so\n\n647\n00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,005\nstay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n648\n00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:08,330\n[MUSIC]\n\n649\n00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,080\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n650\n00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,880\nSo, our next item in our list\nof threats here is spam.\n\n651\n00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,460\nAnd a funny thing happened\nduring the break there is,\n\n652\n00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,360\nwe actually got a spam posted\nto one of our YouTube videos.\n\n653\n00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,100\nSo it was very, very timely,\nI can put it up here on the show.\n\n654\n00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,190\nBut spam, most commonly, is,\nthey call it unsolicited email.\n\n655\n00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,580\nYou get an email from a company or\na person that you've never heard of.\n\n656\n00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,760\nYou've never interacted with them,\nyou've never authorized them to email.\n\n657\n00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,400\nJust out of nowhere you get an email.\n\n658\n00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,880\nNow the email may or may not be malicious,\n\n659\n00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,760\na lot of people think of spam as having\nlike viruses and stuff like that in it,\n\n660\n00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,410\nwhich it certainly can,\nbut oftentimes, it's not.\n\n661\n00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,990\nIt's just, just an advertisement.\n\n662\n00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,640\nThink of it as, like, junk mail that\nyou get in your mailbox at home,\n\n663\n00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,300\nit's the same thing for the internet.\n\n664\n00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,070\nNow most countries have various spam\nregulations and laws, and so forth,\n\n665\n00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,910\nin place.\n\n666\n00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,750\nSo if you take a look at,\nlike, an IT Pro TV email,\n\n667\n00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,060\none of ours, Ours conform to\nwhat's called the Can Spam Act.\n\n668\n00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,670\nIt's an act that was passed here in\nthe US, and has all sorts of regulations.\n\n669\n00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,040\nSo if you've ever wondered why\nat the bottom of our e-mail\n\n670\n00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,430\nwe have the physical address for\nour company, why do we do that?\n\n671\n00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,490\nWell, it's part of the regulation It says\nif you're gonna send email to people,\n\n672\n00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,225\nyou've got to put who you actually are.\n\n673\n00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:27,380\nYour true identity right\nthere at the bottom.\n\n674\n00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,650\nAnd so our corporate information is\nright there at the bottom of the page.\n\n675\n00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,950\nPhone number everything you\nneed to get a hold of us.\n\n676\n00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,190\nThere's also an un subscribe link,\npart of the spam regulations too.\n\n677\n00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,400\nIf you got an email from us, and\nyou don't wanna get anymore,\n\n678\n00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,490\nyou hit that unsubscribe link and,\nand that's it, right?\n\n679\n00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,500\nSo there's gotta be a way to unsubscribe.\n\n680\n00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,260\nThese are things that\nlegitimate email will do.\n\n681\n00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,370\nThe other thing is you should never\nget an email like, like from us,\n\n682\n00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,560\nthat's unsolicited.\n\n683\n00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,780\nWhen you sign up with ITProTV,\nthere's a screen that,\n\n684\n00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,690\nthat you go through and it says that\nyou have to approve your account, so\n\n685\n00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,310\nthat we'll be able to email you\nstatus updates and other information.\n\n686\n00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,040\nSo, you actually approve it and\nit's kind of giving you notice\n\n687\n00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,400\nto say hey in the future, you'll probably\nget emails from us, and, and you do.\n\n688\n00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,120\nWe don't, we don't email very much right?\n\n689\n00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,470\nAt, at, at a minimum you probably get Like\npayment invoice or receipt or whatever,\n\n690\n00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,430\nbut, but, you know, the, the emails still\nbeing sent so we have to conform to that.\n\n691\n00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,520\nBut spammers ignore all of those rules.\n\n692\n00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,460\nRight, cuz they don't care.\n\n693\n00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,250\nAnd, and they just send out\nas many emails as they can,\n\n694\n00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,800\nmillion upon millions of emails.\n\n695\n00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,520\nAnd they, they might be selling Viagra or\nillicit narcotics.\n\n696\n00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,180\nThey might be, drawing you into\nadult entertainment websites,\n\n697\n00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,600\nbecause that's a big money maker\nout there for, for the internet.\n\n698\n00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,510\nSo they're usually trying to draw you\nto some other site where they can then\n\n699\n00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,390\ninfect your system with malware, or\nlure you into some kind of money scam, or\n\n700\n00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,360\nsomething like that.\n\n701\n00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,610\nThere's always a financial\ngain that drives spam.\n\n702\n00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,770\nSomething that's going to make them money.\n\n703\n00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n704\n00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,680\nJust when you don't think that every\nsingle email that you get on the internet\n\n705\n00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,100\nis spam, It wasn't too long ago that they\ndid a study, these five security firms did\n\n706\n00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,210\na study on email that over\n90% of every email is spam.\n\n707\n00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,200\nSo that not only includes personal\nemail but business email as well.\n\n708\n00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,220\nSo I mean, it's amazing about how\nmuch money is actually being made\n\n709\n00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,810\nfrom these little adds that you or\nI would probably ignore.\n\n710\n00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,990\n>> Huh.\n>> There's a lot of people that don't,\n\n711\n00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,890\nand that's why it continues to happen.\n\n712\n00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,650\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the reason\n\n713\n00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,320\nis it's free to send an email.\n\n714\n00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,560\nIt does not cost money to send an email.\n\n715\n00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,520\nSo, if this were postcards in your mailbox\neveryone of them is going to cost at least\n\n716\n00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,620\neleven cents to send and that adds up fast\nif you are sending a million of them.\n\n717\n00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,150\nRight?\n\n718\n00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,440\nBut if you're sending a million emails,\n\n719\n00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,050\nit costs the same as sending one email,\nyou can do it.\n\n720\n00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,030\nSo that's the, the real problem.\n\n721\n00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,870\nBut it's not just email that has spam,\nand so\n\n722\n00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,810\nmy example here is on our YouTube channel,\nlet me bring this up here.\n\n723\n00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,340\nSo we, we post a bunch of how to\nvideos on our, our YouTube channel,\n\n724\n00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,220\nand Nate and Ronnie filmed one that\nwas how to configure Windows Azure, so\n\n725\n00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,440\nthis is the video.\n\n726\n00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,240\nAnd I got an email during the break\nsaying there was a new comment.\n\n727\n00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,240\nAnd, the comment got marked as spam.\n\n728\n00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,480\nAnd here it is.\n\n729\n00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,450\nBasically, it is, can I zoom in.\n\n730\n00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,100\nWill YouTube let me zoom in?\n\n731\n00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,600\nYeah.\n\n732\n00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,760\nThere we go.\nAll right, so here's the comment.\n\n733\n00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,630\nAnd it sounds nice, you know.\n\n734\n00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,970\nYou got a young lady here.\n\n735\n00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,510\nShe says.\n\n736\n00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,600\nOh, make that there.\n\n737\n00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,682\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, there we go.\n\n738\n00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:19,535\n[CROSSTALK] Nicole-Anna\nBeauty Fashion Lifestyle.\n\n739\n00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:22,644\nAnd it says, your videos\nare really entertaining to watch.\n\n740\n00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,270\nI'm always hooked from beginning to end.\n\n741\n00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,080\nYou have inspired me to have\nthe confidence to start my own channel, so\n\n742\n00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,780\nI thank you for that.\n\n743\n00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,032\n>> I'm glad I could help.\n\n744\n00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:31,315\n>> [LAUGH] And, and you know.\n\n745\n00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:34,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The, the odds of somebody who's in\n\n746\n00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,460\nbeauty and health watching our how\nto set up Windows Azure video.\n\n747\n00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,150\nAnd then deciding to start\nwith our own channel,\n\n748\n00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,640\nyou know this is all pretty,\npretty out there.\n\n749\n00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,440\nAnd then, if anyone else is looking to\ncollab, [LAUGH] please let me know.\n\n750\n00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,160\nI'm up for anything, and or\nsubscribe to my channel.\n\n751\n00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,850\n>> Kisses.\n\n752\n00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,380\n>> Oh yeah, kisses, can add that.\n\n753\n00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,770\nAnd then here's the channel.\n\n754\n00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,480\nSo.\n\n755\n00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,570\nWhat happens if I click that?\n\n756\n00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,270\nWell it is a YouTube channel, right?\n\n757\n00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,230\nIt looks like YouTube and\nif I float over it I can see way down here\n\n758\n00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,580\nin my status bar that it is a YouTube\nlink so I'm just going to YouTube.\n\n759\n00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,100\nYou can look for\ntypos if they were there but they aren't.\n\n760\n00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,030\nSo there is a channel here,\n\n761\n00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,430\nI'm not gonna click on it because\nI have no idea what's on that.\n\n762\n00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,920\nBut this is spam, right?\n\n763\n00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,130\nIt does sound nice it is worded very well.\n\n764\n00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,710\nThis is actually a great\nexample here because,\n\n765\n00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,140\nthey've overcome some of\nthe things that we look for.\n\n766\n00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,890\nRight?\nSo what are,\n\n767\n00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,770\nwhat are some of the indicators we know\nthat this is not legitimate email?\n\n768\n00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,230\nUsually really bad grammar.\n\n769\n00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,750\nRight?\n\n770\n00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,690\nReally bad grammar is a big indicator, and\nyou'll see that because a lot of the spam\n\n771\n00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,320\ncomes from other countries, and\nEnglish is not their first language.\n\n772\n00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,510\nSo, if it was somebody in Malaysia where\nthey've grown up speaking you know,\n\n773\n00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,400\nwhatever their local dialect is there,\nthen when they write in English it's,\n\n774\n00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,120\nit's tough, right.\n\n775\n00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,740\nRight, English is a rough\nlanguage to learn, and so\n\n776\n00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,270\nyou'll spot that bad grammar.\n\n777\n00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,840\nRight?\n\n778\n00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,690\nThe other thing is, you'll have a link,\nand you float over the link, and\n\n779\n00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,560\nyou look down to the bottom, and the link.\n\n780\n00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,670\nYou know, we can manipulate this.\n\n781\n00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,240\nwe can make it show whatever we want.\n\n782\n00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,850\nBut when you float over it\ndown there at the bottom,\n\n783\n00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,230\nyou see where it's actually gonna send\nyou, and a lot of times, it'll send you to\n\n784\n00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:10,680\nNot a domain name, but an IP address, so a\nseries of numbers, instead of youtube.com.\n\n785\n00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,660\nNow, this one's overcome that limitation\nby linking to another YouTube channel.\n\n786\n00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,920\nAnd when you go to that channel,\nthere's probably videos there.\n\n787\n00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,020\nAnd they probably contain links\nto other sites beyond that.\n\n788\n00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,980\nAnd you start to, to get wrapped up there.\n\n789\n00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,640\nSo this is a pretty effective\none because a lot of our\n\n790\n00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,690\nkey indicators are missing, right.\n\n791\n00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,080\nIn fact the only thing that really\nclued me in to this being spam is just\n\n792\n00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,430\nhow out of place this email seems.\n\n793\n00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,970\nThe fact that you've got this beauty,\nfashion,\n\n794\n00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,210\nlifestyle person watching server videos.\n\n795\n00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,710\nPretty unlikely.\n\n796\n00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,470\nAnd not, not unheard of you know\npeople do change careers and stuff.\n\n797\n00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,730\nBut you know,\nwhen it says in the description here,\n\n798\n00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,780\nI love anything beauty or fashion related,\nthis really isn't that, so.\n\n799\n00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,470\n>> It could be referring to Nate.\n\n800\n00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,600\n>> Could be, could be.\n\n801\n00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,950\nYou know, Nate,\nvery into haircare products.\n\n802\n00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,655\n>> That's right.\n\n803\n00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:01,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Products, obviously Nate.\n\n804\n00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,690\n>> Alright, so\n>> The,\n\n805\n00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,670\nthe point being though that spam\ntakes more forms than just email.\n\n806\n00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,220\nAnd David in the chatroom made\na really good point there.\n\n807\n00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,820\nOn a spam email they might look like\nthey're conforming with some of the,\n\n808\n00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,770\nthe requirements that are set in CAN-SPAM.\n\n809\n00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,970\nSo they might have an unsubscribe link,\nbut clicking on the unsubscribe link\n\n810\n00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,930\nactually sends you to a malicious site,\nand could potentially infect you with\n\n811\n00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,740\nviruses, or at a minimum, let them know\nthat they just found a valid email.\n\n812\n00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,240\nRight?\n\n813\n00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,800\nAnd so they know to send you more spam.\n\n814\n00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,462\nSo, there, there's a lot of bad stuff\nthere The best solution to this is to\n\n815\n00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:36,583\nimplement a excellent,\nexcellent spam filter.\n\n816\n00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,534\nIf you're using a service like,\noutlook.com, Yahoo Mail, Gmail,\n\n817\n00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:44,921\nif you're using services like that, they\nusually provide spam filtering for you,\n\n818\n00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:46,880\nand they're very effective.\n\n819\n00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,361\nEven on YouTube here, Google marked\nthat as a spam for me, I didn't,\n\n820\n00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:54,500\nI didn't have to do that So they find it\nbecause they've seen this in other places.\n\n821\n00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,210\nThis isn't the first time they've\nseen this post right here.\n\n822\n00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,470\nSo it's spam, and\nI know to come in here and just remove it.\n\n823\n00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,160\nAll right.\n\n824\n00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,730\nBut when you're out there on the internet,\n\n825\n00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,980\nyou might be the first person\nto have seen this one.\n\n826\n00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,120\nThis might be all new.\n\n827\n00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,320\nAnd so, you've gotta be able to interpret\nwhether or not that's actually spam.\n\n828\n00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,840\nA spam filter helps with that.\n\n829\n00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,390\nHere at the office we use a device called\na Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall, and\n\n830\n00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,580\nit basically scans all of our emails and\n\n831\n00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,620\nchecks that, so it just depends on your\norganization whether you need that.\n\n832\n00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,500\nYou know, the, the more, more money you\nspend, the more accurate they are, but\n\n833\n00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,700\nthey are a useful tool.\n\n834\n00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,620\nAll right, next is password cracking.\n\n835\n00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,640\nAll right.\n\n836\n00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,743\nAnd of the various attacks,\nthis is probably the one that's,\n\n837\n00:40:34,743 --> 00:40:36,060\nwe're in the least danger of, right?\n\n838\n00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n839\n00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,030\nWell, in theory we,\nwe should be in the least danger of it.\n\n840\n00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:46,730\nBut the very reality is that if you read\nand different IT posts that are out there,\n\n841\n00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,885\nand security posts, these five companies\nI was just talking about just a,\n\n842\n00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:55,390\na few minutes ago,\nthey also did a scan of emails.\n\n843\n00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,795\nOr not emails,\nof passwords used on the internet.\n\n844\n00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:02,676\nAnd over 80% of the passwords that\nthey were able to find as they were\n\n845\n00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:05,195\ncapturing it, was 123456.\n\n846\n00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:09,770\n[LAUGH] Well that doesn't make it\nvery difficult for a 6-year-old\n\n847\n00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,270\nhacker to figure out, better yet somebody\nthat has any more experience, Don.\n\n848\n00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,278\nSo password cracking can be difficult,\nbut it doesn't have to be,\n\n849\n00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:22,050\nbecause the end-user himself may not be\nusing a very difficult password at all.\n\n850\n00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,720\n>> And\nthere's a company called SplashData, and\n\n851\n00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,742\nthey put out an annual list\nwhere they rank passwords.\n\n852\n00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:28,263\n>> There it is.\n\n853\n00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:29,815\n[LAUGH]\n>> And where they get it,\n\n854\n00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:31,880\nis whenever there's a compromise, right?\n\n855\n00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,730\nWhen you hear about like who,\nwho's been compromised really big,\n\n856\n00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,100\nlike Sony, when their, their Sony Online\nEntertainment was hacked or, or whatever.\n\n857\n00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,330\nThe hackers will oftentimes\nrelease the database.\n\n858\n00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,520\nThey'll, they'll release\nit on the internet.\n\n859\n00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,750\nThey say here, go wild guys!\n\n860\n00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,850\nHere's all the usernames and\npasswords you could want.\n\n861\n00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,287\nAnd so what they do, is they grab that\ndata and they scan the passwords, and\n\n862\n00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,444\nthey look for patterns.\n\n863\n00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:56,457\nAnd so they rank it by some of the worst\npasswords, or very, very common and\n\n864\n00:41:56,457 --> 00:42:00,789\nyou'll see last year it used to be that\njust the word password was used by a ton\n\n865\n00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:03,750\nof people, and\nit's been unseated by 123456.\n\n866\n00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,420\nAnd you can just kinda go down the list\nhere, and they show all the really bad\n\n867\n00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,556\nones that a lot of people use, and, and\nI mean there are some, some real bad ones.\n\n868\n00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:18,594\nIf we if we'll look in here like 12345678.\n\n869\n00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:19,337\n>> Oh, wow.\n\n870\n00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,230\n>> At least they go a little bit further.\n\n871\n00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,000\nOld qwerty.\n\n872\n00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,590\n>> Qwerty, yeah.\n\n873\n00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,070\n>> Hit the top keys on the keyboard.\n\n874\n00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,580\nI mean, these are just terrible ones,\nand a lot of people use these things.\n\n875\n00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,530\nSo, that's problematic because now\nsomebody doesn't have to crack\n\n876\n00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,040\nyour password.\n\n877\n00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,620\nThey can just do what's called a brute\nforce, and they can just attempt these.\n\n878\n00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,960\nAnd sure it might fail on yours, but\n\n879\n00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,310\nif they try a hundred accounts,\nmaybe one of them works.\n\n880\n00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,930\nAnd they get in, and now they can go.\n\n881\n00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,080\nSo, if any of these look familiar to you,\nshame on you.\n\n882\n00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,600\nSo.\n\n883\n00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,510\n>> Let me in on number 14,\nis probably a bad one.\n\n884\n00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,230\n>> Princess, isn't that the one you use?\n\n885\n00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,522\n>> I think that's one that I used to used,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n886\n00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:53,083\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I did a capital p, so [CROSSTALK]\n\n887\n00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,140\n>> Now there's a one after it [LAUGH].\n\n888\n00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,860\nPrincess one.\n\n889\n00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,580\n>> That's right.\n\n890\n00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,250\n>> So, you know, it is very common.\n\n891\n00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,130\nPeople use weak passwords, and\nso your password can be guessed.\n\n892\n00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,720\nBut even if you use a strong password,\npasswords can be figured out.\n\n893\n00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,240\nPassword cracking is where somebody tries\nto determine what your password is,\n\n894\n00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,590\nand it's not just guessing.\n\n895\n00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,050\nGuessing, that's called bruteforcing.\n\n896\n00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,330\nYou just keep guessing, and guessing,\nand guessing until you hit it.\n\n897\n00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,190\nMost systems have protections from that.\n\n898\n00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,990\nHave you ever tried to log in to a site\na couple of times, you couldn't remember\n\n899\n00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,510\nyour password and then it tells\nyou you're locked out, right?\n\n900\n00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,980\nThat stops bruteforcing.\n\n901\n00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,740\nYou only give so\nmany guesses before it locks you out.\n\n902\n00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,170\nBut with cracking, what they do, is they\nintercept some of your network traffic.\n\n903\n00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,760\nAnd your password is sent across\nthe network when you log in,\n\n904\n00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,760\nbut it's not normally just\nyour straight up password.\n\n905\n00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,830\nIt's normally what's called a hash.\n\n906\n00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,400\nThey run a formula on it, and\n\n907\n00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,710\nit generates an alternate value\nthat represents the password.\n\n908\n00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,780\nIf you have the formula,\nyou can figure what the password is.\n\n909\n00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,084\nIf you don't have the formula, you can't.\n\n910\n00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:53,565\nAnd there's some formulas\nthat can't be reversed, so\n\n911\n00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:57,220\neven if you do have the formula, you still\ncan't figure out what the password is.\n\n912\n00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,970\nThose are like md5 hashes and stuff,\nwhere they just can't be reversed, but\n\n913\n00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,335\nthat doesn't stop you from trying\nto figure it out yourself.\n\n914\n00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:10,200\nAnd so you could try millions of\npasswords, encrypting each one and\n\n915\n00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,090\ncomparing what you get with what\nyou captured off of the network,\n\n916\n00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:16,760\nand when you find a match, there you go,\nyou just figured out that password.\n\n917\n00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,470\nThat's the art of cracking.\n\n918\n00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,660\nNow, password cracking\nis very time-consuming.\n\n919\n00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,480\nIt can take weeks, months,\n\n920\n00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,382\nit can take years with some of these\nhashes to be able to break that password.\n\n921\n00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,850\nSo you see where this is\nnot a very effective thing.\n\n922\n00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,780\nA lot of companies require you to\nchange your password every two months.\n\n923\n00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,740\nIf you do that, most forms of password\ncracking are not gonna be useful.\n\n924\n00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,940\nCuz it'll take somebody more than\ntwo months to get that password, and\n\n925\n00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,200\nyou've already changed it by that point,\nright?\n\n926\n00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,350\nBut if you used a weak password, something\nthat's guessable, a dictionary term.\n\n927\n00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,570\nYou know, just a word that's\nin the regular dictionary.\n\n928\n00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,530\nThey'll, they'll guess that usually first,\nright?\n\n929\n00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,570\nThat's why we need to mix\nin special characters.\n\n930\n00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,150\nAnd then the longer the password,\nthe better and, and things like that.\n\n931\n00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,230\nYou know, you'll see a lot of people\nthat require eight characters.\n\n932\n00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,700\nI usually do 12 characters.\n\n933\n00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,770\nI don't like to go crazy.\n\n934\n00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,220\nYou see people out there that\ngo 20 characters or more.\n\n935\n00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:07,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that,\n\n936\n00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,150\nthat's a little overkill in my opinion.\n\n937\n00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,770\nBut but basically you need to\nchange your password often.\n\n938\n00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,640\nNow there are some password protocols\nthat were used in the past that\n\n939\n00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,740\nhave been broken.\n\n940\n00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,950\nSo there's some of them like the old\nWindows authentication called NTLM.\n\n941\n00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,600\nThat one it got broken several years ago,\nand\n\n942\n00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,300\nit was through a roundabout\nway that they did it.\n\n943\n00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,680\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\n944\n00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,200\nNow you can reverse an NTLM password,\nusually within a handful of minutes.\n\n945\n00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,800\nIt doesn't take very long.\n\n946\n00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,570\nSo using older systems makes you more\nsusceptible to password cracking.\n\n947\n00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,601\nSo we definitely need to make sure\nwe keep our systems up-to-date, and\n\n948\n00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:43,702\nwe use strong passwords.\n\n949\n00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:51,420\nAll right, now the last section we've\ngot on this one is physical security.\n\n950\n00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,150\nAnd of all the ones we've listed, physical\nsecurity is the most commonly breached.\n\n951\n00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,830\nAll right,\npeople forget about physical security.\n\n952\n00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,240\nWhat good does your firewall\ndo if somebody can walk\n\n953\n00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,340\nright into your building, grab a computer,\nand walk right back out again?\n\n954\n00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,210\nRight?\n\n955\n00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,760\nDid they even go over your network?\n\n956\n00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,630\nNo.\n\n957\n00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,570\nYou've got to have physical security on\nyour equipment to stop it from walking\n\n958\n00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,510\nout, because once somebody has your\nequipment in hand, there's all sorts of\n\n959\n00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,710\nthings they can do to bypass passwords\nand, and log in and all that stuff.\n\n960\n00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,180\nThey can just gain access to everything.\n\n961\n00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,390\nIf somebody has physical access to\nyour system, your data is not safe.\n\n962\n00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,750\nSo this is really one of the most\nimportant ones that we can secure.\n\n963\n00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n964\n00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,870\nWith the physical security side, it also\nmeans that we have to be careful about not\n\n965\n00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,100\nonly people getting in but even at,\nat the individual work station,\n\n966\n00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,810\nmaking sure that those devices\nare locked down, down right there, too.\n\n967\n00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,430\nSo, we not only protect ourselves by using\nthings like locks, but then we also take\n\n968\n00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,130\na look at the hard drives themselves, and\nmay even actually encrypt the drives.\n\n969\n00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,950\nYou name it, there's so many different\nways that we can actually implement more\n\n970\n00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,135\nsecurity it's amazing, you know.\n\n971\n00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n972\n00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,280\nYeah, the the story I always\nlike to tell is here in Florida,\n\n973\n00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,590\njust a handful of years ago,\nthere was a gentleman who was,\n\n974\n00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,800\nwas running an illegal\nbusiness out of Miami.\n\n975\n00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,480\nAnd what he would do is he would\ntravel to cities around Florida, so\n\n976\n00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,340\nit wasn't just in Miami they actually\nbusted him for doing this in Tampa.\n\n977\n00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,381\nAnd what he would do,\nis he would dress up in a like a,\n\n978\n00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:28,079\na business casual outfit you know,\nslacks and a button up shirt.\n\n979\n00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,193\nAnd he had a name badge that he\nwould put on, it said he worked for\n\n980\n00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:35,040\nso-and-so computer company, it was\nlike a made-up computer company name.\n\n981\n00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,209\nAnd he would wait until lunch time, and\n\n982\n00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:40,043\nhe would walk into big\noffice buildings downtown.\n\n983\n00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:44,867\nHe'd walk into the office buildings when\nhe knew that people were out to lunch,\n\n984\n00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:46,458\nand he would bring a cart.\n\n985\n00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:50,724\nAnd he would walk right in the front\ndoor and walk around the offices and\n\n986\n00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:54,206\nhe would look for\nempty offices that had laptops in them.\n\n987\n00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:57,735\nAnd he would walk right in there,\ngrab the laptop, grab its power adaptor,\n\n988\n00:47:57,735 --> 00:48:00,065\nthrow it on the cart and\nwalk on to the next office.\n\n989\n00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:02,503\nAnd he would stack up five, ten laptops.\n\n990\n00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:06,838\nAnd if anybody stopped him, he would say,\noh, you know, I'm the warranty repair guy.\n\n991\n00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:08,287\nI'm here to look at some of these laptops,\n\n992\n00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:09,996\nwe've got some bad\nbatteries we're replacing.\n\n993\n00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:13,085\nAnd people wouldn't,\nwouldn't second guess that, you know,\n\n994\n00:48:13,085 --> 00:48:17,197\nhe's got a name badge says, says he works\nfor a computer company, he's got the cart.\n\n995\n00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,080\nHe's got a cart.\n\n996\n00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,621\nWho, who,\nwho would do stuff illegally with a cart?\n\n997\n00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:21,899\nThat's, that's crazy talk.\n\n998\n00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,579\nSo, [LAUGH] so they would,\nthey would just think nothing of him and\n\n999\n00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:26,432\nhe would walk around and\ngrab these things and\n\n1000\n00:48:26,432 --> 00:48:29,136\nhe would just walk right out the front\ndoor and then that was that.\n\n1001\n00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:30,216\nHe'd had the stack of laptops.\n\n1002\n00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:33,661\nHe'd take them back to Miami and\nhe would format them, he would\n\n1003\n00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,959\ninstall a usually bootlegged copy of\nWindows and then he'd sell them on eBay.\n\n1004\n00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,166\nHe's just go on eBay and sell them off and\nso he was selling these stolen laptops,\n\n1005\n00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,636\nmaking good money just walking\nright in and out of buildings.\n\n1006\n00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:47,978\nNow that story I mean,\nthere's good and bad there.\n\n1007\n00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:49,253\nRight?\nOn the good side,\n\n1008\n00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:51,628\nhe was just formatting the laptops and\nselling them.\n\n1009\n00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:55,506\nSo the data that was on those laptops,\nhe didn't care about that.\n\n1010\n00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:58,385\nIf he had wanted, he had those laptops.\n\n1011\n00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:01,693\nSo, if they have medical information,\nfinancial information,\n\n1012\n00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:02,703\nhe had access to it.\n\n1013\n00:49:02,703 --> 00:49:05,501\nThat data could have been compromised,\nright?\n\n1014\n00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:09,971\nThe other thing is they did finally catch\nhim and it was when he robbed this,\n\n1015\n00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:14,002\nthis company in Tampa that had little\nLoJack devices on their laptops.\n\n1016\n00:49:14,002 --> 00:49:18,169\nAnd the way this works is there's a little\ntracking system that's built into\n\n1017\n00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:22,719\nthe motherboard and even if you format the\nwhole laptop, even if you replace the hard\n\n1018\n00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,911\ndrive entirely, the next time you plug\nit in to the network, it phones home.\n\n1019\n00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:30,790\nAnd so they had, I think it was It was\n15 laptops or so that got stolen and\n\n1020\n00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,606\nwhen the guy took them back to his\ncondo and he started formatting them,\n\n1021\n00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:38,573\nhe put them on the internet to go into\nWindows update and they phoned home.\n\n1022\n00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:41,683\nAnd they all phoned home from his\napartment and law enforcement was able to\n\n1023\n00:49:41,683 --> 00:49:44,758\ngo right there and bust him and\nhe had stacks of laptops in the apartment.\n\n1024\n00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:47,498\nAnd so that's, that's what can happen.\n\n1025\n00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:50,748\nAnd that's a, a,\na problem with physical security.\n\n1026\n00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:54,835\nHe should not have been able to walk\ninto that building first off, right?\n\n1027\n00:49:54,835 --> 00:49:59,354\nSecondly, he should not have been able\nto move office to office without being\n\n1028\n00:49:59,354 --> 00:50:00,617\nvalidated somehow.\n\n1029\n00:50:00,617 --> 00:50:05,365\nAnd third, those laptops should not\nhave been sitting there unsecured.\n\n1030\n00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:10,194\nThere's thing we can do to stop this\ntype of attack at multiple places and\n\n1031\n00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:14,166\nany one of them would have\nstopped the attack all together.\n\n1032\n00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,907\n>> So hardware theft fairly common.\n\n1033\n00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:20,505\nThe other one that you, you hear about\nmore often is the software theft.\n\n1034\n00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:25,106\nYou've probably heard it on the radio,\nyou've probably seen it on TV that tells\n\n1035\n00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,623\nyou that software theft today is,\nis as great as it ever was and\n\n1036\n00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:33,492\nthe way that it happens is, is companies\nwill allow their their employees to\n\n1037\n00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:37,379\nbring software and install it on\na computer, then make a copy of it.\n\n1038\n00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:40,816\nThey take it home and then install it on\ntheir own computer system at home too.\n\n1039\n00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:44,433\nAnd a lot of times when you start hearing\nthese public service announcements\n\n1040\n00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:48,006\nit's always saying, hey, that's a bad\nthing make sure you report this.\n\n1041\n00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:52,647\n>> And you know, your company might buy a\nbulk of license from Microsoft Office, so\n\n1042\n00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:55,796\nthey get one product key\nthat can be used 200 times.\n\n1043\n00:50:55,796 --> 00:50:59,252\nAnd they start installing it and\nthey get through hundred computers and\n\n1044\n00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:01,217\nthen it tells them they're out of keys.\n\n1045\n00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:02,009\nAnd they only used half.\n\n1046\n00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:03,075\nWhat happened to the other half?\n\n1047\n00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:06,143\nWell, an employee may have gotten\nthe key and shared it with friends,\n\n1048\n00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:09,471\ninstalled it on unauthorized machines and\nnow you've got software theft.\n\n1049\n00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:10,193\nRight?\n\n1050\n00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:13,711\nYou find a lot of times when you buy\nsoftware off of eBay of whatever,\n\n1051\n00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:15,273\nthat can be stolen software.\n\n1052\n00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,562\nIt does happen.\n\n1053\n00:51:16,562 --> 00:51:19,849\nThat's why we have these activation\nsystems you have to go though to make sure\n\n1054\n00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,833\nthat you're, you're software is genuine.\n\n1055\n00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,451\nYou know, not, no actually bootlegged or\nstolen or copied.\n\n1056\n00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:29,155\nSoftware at it's heart is really\njust a bunch of ones and zeros, so\n\n1057\n00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:32,357\nit is easy to duplicate and\nrepresents that.\n\n1058\n00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:33,048\nAll right.\n\n1059\n00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,872\nShoulder surfing is another one.\n\n1060\n00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:38,194\nNow, Comtec throws this one\nunder physical security.\n\n1061\n00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:40,798\nSome of the other vendors out there\nactually put this under social\n\n1062\n00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:41,421\nengineering.\n\n1063\n00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:47,144\nBut for this exam, shoulder surfing\nis a type of physical compromise.\n\n1064\n00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:51,078\nWhen you are logging into your computer\nand it asks you for your password,\n\n1065\n00:51:51,078 --> 00:51:52,102\nyou gotta type it.\n\n1066\n00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:54,577\nYou gotta take your hands,\nyou gotta put em on the keyboard and\n\n1067\n00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:55,632\nyou gotta touch the keys.\n\n1068\n00:51:55,632 --> 00:51:58,988\nIf somebody's standing behind you,\nthey can look over your shoulder,\n\n1069\n00:51:58,988 --> 00:52:01,088\nthat's why it's called shoulder surfing.\n\n1070\n00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,724\nAnd they could see which keys\nyou're touching on your keyboard.\n\n1071\n00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:06,297\nAnd now, they know your password.\n\n1072\n00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:11,269\nI have a, a tablet at home and\nI have a password on it.\n\n1073\n00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,691\nYou know, if you wanna unlock my tablet,\nyou gotta punch in a code.\n\n1074\n00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:16,863\nAnd my son,\nhe likes to play games on the tablet.\n\n1075\n00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:19,817\nAnd so whenever he wanted this,\nhe had to bring the tablet to me and\n\n1076\n00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,586\nI would unlock it and\nhe would get in there and play the games.\n\n1077\n00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:27,436\nWell, after a couple of weeks,\n[LAUGH] he came to me and said, dad,\n\n1078\n00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:29,355\nI can unlock your tablet.\n\n1079\n00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,909\nAnd sure enough,\nhe'd punch the code in, log right in.\n\n1080\n00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:33,962\nHe had seen me do enough\nthat over the times,\n\n1081\n00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:36,581\nhe was able to tell exactly\nwhich numbers I was hitting.\n\n1082\n00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:37,858\nHe was able to get in.\n\n1083\n00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:40,400\nNow, I don't worry about it so\nmuch, I'm at home.\n\n1084\n00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,461\nBut if you're on a bus in an airplane,\nyou got people around you and\n\n1085\n00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,650\nyou're punching in your passwords,\npeople can see that.\n\n1086\n00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,632\nAnd so we've gotta take steps to ensure\nthat that doesn't happen, all right?\n\n1087\n00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:55,397\nNow there's not a whole heck of a lot\nof ways to prevent that when you're in\n\n1088\n00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:59,711\na crowded area other than not to type in\nyour password and just wait until later.\n\n1089\n00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:03,141\nThere are different other technologies\nthough a lot of people with their,\n\n1090\n00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,566\ntheir laptops, for example.\n\n1091\n00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:08,386\nYou can get these screen protectors\nalmost all banks use these now.\n\n1092\n00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:12,589\nThere is a little screen protectors that\ngo on your screen and they're clear.\n\n1093\n00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,351\nThey just, they don't look any\ndifferent than the normal screen.\n\n1094\n00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:18,490\nBut if you look at the screen\nfrom any kind of angle,\n\n1095\n00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,391\nthe whole screen turns black.\n\n1096\n00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:23,281\nThey're basically polarize, they got\nthese little channels inside of them.\n\n1097\n00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:27,349\nAnd when you look at an angle, you're\nseeing the edges of theses channels and so\n\n1098\n00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:29,062\nit turns the whole screen black.\n\n1099\n00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:32,708\nBut when you're looking straight on,\nit's perfectly clear like normal.\n\n1100\n00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:36,342\nSo that stops people in your periphery\nfrom being able to see your laptop.\n\n1101\n00:53:36,342 --> 00:53:40,019\nThey don't stop somebody standing directly\nbehind you though, so there is that risk,\n\n1102\n00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:41,666\nbut it would be much more challenging.\n\n1103\n00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,453\nSomebody would have to look\nthrough your head, right?\n\n1104\n00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:47,306\nSo they'd have to, like really be on\nyour shoulder to see that screen.\n\n1105\n00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:49,626\nBut that is one technology you can use.\n\n1106\n00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,539\nAnother one is you'll see a lot of phones\nnow have switched to fingerprint scanners.\n\n1107\n00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:57,126\nSo you want to unlock your phone or\nyour tablet, you scan your fingerprint.\n\n1108\n00:53:57,126 --> 00:54:00,007\nI don't care if they see which finger I\nuse, they're not gonna take my, well,\n\n1109\n00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,863\nif they take my finger,\nI've got other problems.\n\n1110\n00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,187\nBut you know, so they're not gonna see it,\n\n1111\n00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:06,321\nit's not like a code they can watch and\npunch in.\n\n1112\n00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:08,967\nSo these are ways that we\nget around that problem.\n\n1113\n00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:12,469\nYou know, on the topic of solutions,\nwe talk about physical security.\n\n1114\n00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:17,152\nSome of the solutions there, security\nguards at the front door, sign in lists.\n\n1115\n00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:17,887\nRight?\n\n1116\n00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:18,997\nVisitor badges.\n\n1117\n00:54:18,997 --> 00:54:20,680\nDon't let people use their own badge,\n\n1118\n00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,931\nhave your own visitor badges\nthat they have to wear.\n\n1119\n00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:24,824\nThose are all things\nthat can help with that.\n\n1120\n00:54:24,824 --> 00:54:28,050\nLocked offices and\neven equipment locked for your machines.\n\n1121\n00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,640\nMost computers have a what it'\ncalled is it a tar, a TARDIS lock?\n\n1122\n00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,615\nWhat, what those are called?\n>> Kensington.\n\n1123\n00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:33,741\n>> Kensington lock.\n\n1124\n00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:36,576\nSo they'll have this little notch\nin the side of your laptops for\n\n1125\n00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:40,108\nputting in a Kensington lock, which is\na cable that will lock down to your desk.\n\n1126\n00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:42,301\nSo now somebody can't\nphysically take the laptop.\n\n1127\n00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:46,237\nThese are all simple steps that we can put\nin place that eliminate all these attacks.\n\n1128\n00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:49,811\nEverything we've talked about on\nthis show has a simple solution,\n\n1129\n00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:51,577\nif we educate our users about it.\n\n1130\n00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:52,715\n>> Yeah.\n\n1131\n00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:56,917\nOur last topic that we're gonna\ncover is dumpster diving.\n\n1132\n00:54:56,917 --> 00:55:00,736\nThere's a lot of times when companies\nare trying to get rid of older systems.\n\n1133\n00:55:00,736 --> 00:55:03,646\nAnd what ends of happening is that,\neven though they might,\n\n1134\n00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:06,730\nthey're supposed to go through\na particular procedure in a very\n\n1135\n00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,317\nquick instance,\nthey might all end up in a dumpster.\n\n1136\n00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:12,755\nSomebody could easily jump in that\ndumpster and not only get these systems\n\n1137\n00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:15,748\nout, but maybe other data that you\nmay have put in there as well,\n\n1138\n00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:19,649\nwhich means that they could get access to\nthat and use that data to their advantage.\n\n1139\n00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,357\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1140\n00:55:20,357 --> 00:55:23,864\nYeah, when you throw a computer in the\ntrash or, or even if you sell it on eBay,\n\n1141\n00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:26,220\nwhat happens to your data\nthat was on that computer?\n\n1142\n00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,845\nIt doesn't magically disappear.\n\n1143\n00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:28,794\nIt's there.\n\n1144\n00:55:28,794 --> 00:55:33,886\nAnd even if you format the computer and\nerase it, the magnetic residual signals\n\n1145\n00:55:33,886 --> 00:55:38,458\nare still there on your disk and\nin most cases and they can be recovered.\n\n1146\n00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:41,843\nIt takes Five minutes on Google,\nto find a program for 20 bucks,\n\n1147\n00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:44,710\nthat'll scan a hard drive and\nrecover lost data.\n\n1148\n00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,020\nYou can spend thousands of dollars and\n\n1149\n00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,230\nget the high end stuff too, and\nrecover data from the drive.\n\n1150\n00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,300\nIf you had sensitive or\n\n1151\n00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,530\nconfidential information that was\non there, somebody could get it.\n\n1152\n00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,690\nThey'd just have to dig through\nthe dumpster of your trash or, you know,\n\n1153\n00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,890\nbuy equipment from you on eBay or\nwhatever.\n\n1154\n00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,060\nAnd now they'll have access\nto that information.\n\n1155\n00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:07,890\nSo, any time you dispose of a computer\nsystem, you need to check it for data.\n\n1156\n00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,900\nAnd if you don't have a proper way to\nsanitize that hard drive to ensure\n\n1157\n00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,900\nthe data's not on there,\nthen you need to destroy the hard drive.\n\n1158\n00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,600\nIf you go on eBay,\n\n1159\n00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,580\nyou can find a lot of computers that are\nbeing sold with no hard drive included.\n\n1160\n00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:23,630\nAnd that'll usually mean that it came from\nsome agency that was smart enough to say,\n\n1161\n00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,095\nwe can't trust that our drives are empty,\nso we are just gonna destroy them.\n\n1162\n00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,820\nAnd there's companies that\ndo hard drive shredding.\n\n1163\n00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,387\nThey have these giant commercial\nshredders that will destroy them, or\n\n1164\n00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:35,010\nthey drill holes in them, or whatever,\nthere's various ways to do it.\n\n1165\n00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,870\nThe, the drilling holes thing isn't\nas effective as they make it sound.\n\n1166\n00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,145\nBut, but you can just destroy them.\n\n1167\n00:56:40,145 --> 00:56:42,190\nIt'/s the, the really best way to be safe.\n\n1168\n00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,800\nAnd, it extends beyond computers too,\nall right, be careful with firewalls.\n\n1169\n00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,470\nA lot of people will\nthrow a firewall away.\n\n1170\n00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,030\nWell, what's on that firewall?\n\n1171\n00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,880\nThere's configurations.\n\n1172\n00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,980\nAnd list what ports you allowed,\nwhat VPN you had set up, and so on.\n\n1173\n00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,710\nWell, you obviously replaced\nit with a new firewall.\n\n1174\n00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,630\nYou probably follow the same\nconfiguration on the new firewall, right.\n\n1175\n00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,950\nIt might be faster,\nit might be bigger, but\n\n1176\n00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,240\nyou're probably allowing\nthe same ports and the same IPs.\n\n1177\n00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,320\nNow an attacker knows what's\navailable on your system.\n\n1178\n00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,215\nSo, any kind of computer gear not\nbeing disposed, not just PCs,\n\n1179\n00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:18,801\nneedS to be sanitized or destroyed, so\nthat your personal data doesn't get out.\n\n1180\n00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,514\nOther ways to solve a problem,\nif you do full drive encryption,\n\n1181\n00:57:23,514 --> 00:57:28,545\nMicrosoft BitLocker TrueCrypt, what was\nthe, what's the new name at TrueCrypt?\n\n1182\n00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,670\nThe, the guys that forked it?\n\n1183\n00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:33,647\n>> I don't remember\n>> I can't remember either, but yeah,\n\n1184\n00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:36,380\nthere, there's several different\nsystems out there has one,\n\n1185\n00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,390\nwhere you can encrypt\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n1186\n00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,850\nNow you can format it,\nthrow data on there, fine, and\n\n1187\n00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:46,450\nif somebody tries to recover your deleted\ndata, they get encrypted data, and\n\n1188\n00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,100\nso it's, it's not of any use to them.\n\n1189\n00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,900\nThose are steps you can take to help\nsecure your data on your system,\n\n1190\n00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,730\nso that it doesn't leak out.\n\n1191\n00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,750\nBut dumpster diving can go even further.\n\n1192\n00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:01,470\nMaybe you've thrown away some electric\nutility bills, and if somebody wants to do\n\n1193\n00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,580\nidentity theft, they're gonna\nhave to prove that they are you.\n\n1194\n00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,010\nAnd they can say, well, here,\nI've got my electric bill.\n\n1195\n00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:06,550\nRight?\n\n1196\n00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,100\nOr they can find other things\non there that have your\n\n1197\n00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,630\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n1198\n00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:15,030\nThings like user names, or\naccount numbers, and so on.\n\n1199\n00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,200\nI mean, that's stuff that gets\nlisted on a lot of paperwork that\n\n1200\n00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,260\nmight get thrown away.\n\n1201\n00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,240\nSo, you should really make\nsure paperwork is shredded or\n\n1202\n00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,460\ndestroyed, if it's got\nidentification information on it.\n\n1203\n00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,860\nAll right, so that pretty much\ncovers the basic security threats.\n\n1204\n00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,590\nWe've got more to cover\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n1205\n00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,440\nWe've got two little sections\nthat we've gotta hit.\n\n1206\n00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,560\nBut for this episode,\nthat's probably a good stopping point,\n\n1207\n00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,320\ndon't you think, Ronnie?\n\n1208\n00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,450\n>> I do.\n>> All right.\n\n1209\n00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,530\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwrap this one up here.\n\n1210\n00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,320\nStay tuned though.\n\n1211\n00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,120\nWe've got more security\nepisodes coming up.\n\n1212\n00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,600\nAnd let me remind you guys that if\nyou have questions on any of this,\n\n1213\n00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,930\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1214\n00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:48,750\nLive during the show,\n\n1215\n00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,140\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live, and you'll\nsee the chat right beneath the video.\n\n1216\n00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,010\nPost your questions there.\n\n1217\n00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,270\nWe monitor and answer during the

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,440\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening,\n\n6\n00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,603\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:41,592\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:42,550\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,560\n>> It is going well.\n\n10\n00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,965\nI, I will admit I did have nothing\nto do with the US Postal attack.\n\n11\n00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cyber hacking, so\n\n12\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,130\nI'm in that freely right now.\n\n13\n00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,660\n>> We were, we were challenging Ronnie\nduring the break, because you know,\n\n14\n00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,550\nbeing of chinese ethnicity, you're\nobviously responsible for the compromise.\n\n15\n00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,080\n>> I am.\n\n16\n00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960\nI am, because, there are so\n\n17\n00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,388\nmany Chinese Rednecks out there that\nwill absolutely compromise, you know.\n\n18\n00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:03,575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n19\n00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,240\n>> All right, well, as you might\nhave guessed from our conversation,\n\n20\n00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,230\nwe are picking back up with\nanother episode on security.\n\n21\n00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,420\nAnd in particular, we're tackling\nobjective 3.2 given a scenario,\n\n22\n00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,770\nuse security best practices.\n\n23\n00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,020\nAnd, a lot of these compromises\nthat we heart about,\n\n24\n00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,710\nespecially the ones where they say,\noh, it's Chinese hackers or whatever.\n\n25\n00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,215\nSure, there [CROSSTALK] there are people\nthat are really intelligent that,\n\n26\n00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,064\nthat do this stuff, but the majority of it\nis pretty easy to overcome, to prevent.\n\n27\n00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,404\nIf people would take some basic steps you\ncould really secure systems considerably\n\n28\n00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,579\nmore and not leave yourself open to that.\n\n29\n00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,130\nAnd, that's what this\nobjective is all about.\n\n30\n00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,560\nWhat are some of those basic steps?\n\n31\n00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,060\nAnd, we're going to start\nwith password management.\n\n32\n00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,260\nPassword management is one of\nthe most woefully neglected areas\n\n33\n00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,340\nin people's securities policies.\n\n34\n00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,750\nPeople hate passwords.\n\n35\n00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,105\nAnd so, they make mistakes with their\npasswords that make them extremely easy to\n\n36\n00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:56,230\nbe compromised and used against them.\n\n37\n00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,151\nAnd, there's really just a handful\nof things that we can easily\n\n38\n00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,676\ndo to help stop that, all right?\n\n39\n00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:04,100\nThe first one that CompTIA calls\nout is password complexity.\n\n40\n00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,640\nWhat password complexity does is it\naddresses somebody guessing your password.\n\n41\n00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,100\nIf you used a simple password, someone\ncould probably guess it pretty easily, and\n\n42\n00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,450\nthey' re not going to guess it themselves.\n\n43\n00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,949\nThey probably run, like,\na program, a brute force program,\n\n44\n00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,184\nto try to guess your password.\n\n45\n00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:21,992\nIf your password is a word is\nright out of a dictionary,\n\n46\n00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,312\nwell they'll use\nthe dictionary as input for\n\n47\n00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:28,607\nthis software to be able to run all these\nwords, and probably guess your password.\n\n48\n00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,225\nBut, if you mixed it up a little\nbit with some capital letters and\n\n49\n00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,302\nlower case letters, some numbers,\n\n50\n00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:39,560\nmaybe even a few special characters like\nan @ symbol or an exclamation point.\n\n51\n00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,000\nThose will make it where your word is\nno longer a common dictionary word.\n\n52\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,250\nAnd, they won't just be able to\ndo a regular dictionary attack,\n\n53\n00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,950\nwhich may only take a few minutes.\n\n54\n00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,470\nNow, they'll have to do a much\nmore aggressive character attack.\n\n55\n00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,150\nSo, if you have a one character password,\n\n56\n00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,790\nthey would have to run a through z\nlowercase, then a through z uppercase.\n\n57\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,780\nThen, one through zero,\nthen at, exclamation point,\n\n58\n00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,000\nperiod, space, greater than,\nless than, all the other symbols.\n\n59\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,730\nThey would have to try all of that,\njust for one character.\n\n60\n00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,990\nIf you had a two character password,\nif it was two letters, numbers,\n\n61\n00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,530\nwhatever, then they would\nhave to do a combination.\n\n62\n00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,300\nThey might have a in the first one,\nand a in the second one.\n\n63\n00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,306\nThen, they try a in the first one,\nand b in the second one.\n\n64\n00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:29,751\nAnd a, and then, then, you know,\nac, ad, all the way up to az.\n\n65\n00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:35,840\nThen, they start over again at ba, bb, bc,\nbd, you know, it keeps going like that.\n\n66\n00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,460\nAnd then, they have to do it\nall over again for uppercase.\n\n67\n00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,344\nAnd, it would take years, potentially, to,\n\n68\n00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:43,526\nto guess what that password\nis based on that method.\n\n69\n00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:46,263\nCuz we have to calculate up,\nthe more characters you have,\n\n70\n00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:49,624\nthe more special characters,\nthat makes it harder to guess a password.\n\n71\n00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:54,570\nIf your password is just a word out of\nthe dictionary, you will get compromised.\n\n72\n00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,810\nI mean, it's that simple.\n\n73\n00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,440\nBut, splash in a little\nextra complexity and\n\n74\n00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,310\nyour password will become far more secure.\n\n75\n00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,290\n>> Yeah.\nA lot of times what it actually,\n\n76\n00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,190\nwhat also we can do instead if you go, I\ndo think I can remember all those special\n\n77\n00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,730\ncharacters, is now that they give you\nthe ability to create long passwords.\n\n78\n00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,330\nYou might even be able to use\nyour favorite phrase out of\n\n79\n00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,250\nsomething that you like, maybe a poem.\n\n80\n00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,007\nOr, maybe like Don, might like rap music.\n\n81\n00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, he might choose his favorite first\n\n82\n00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,580\nline to his gangster rap song or something\nlike that, to be able to type in.\n\n83\n00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,435\nBut usually it, it gives you that many\ncharacters that, that you can do so,\n\n84\n00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,345\nif you'll be able to remember it,\nthat's the key.\n\n85\n00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:32,455\nBut, multiple words with spaces in-between\nis pretty much an idea that we can use.\n\n86\n00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:36,570\n>> Yeah, and, you know, some of the things\nmake a password complex, the length.\n\n87\n00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,990\nThe special characters,\nthe numbers, upper and lowercase.\n\n88\n00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,520\nAnd, when you tell somebody to do that,\n\n89\n00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,280\nthey go,\nhow am I going to remember that, right?\n\n90\n00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,750\nBut not thinking of it as a password,\n\n91\n00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,940\nbut instead thinking of it as\na passphrase can really help out.\n\n92\n00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,130\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n93\n00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,660\nI'm going to write a sentence here.\n\n94\n00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,538\nOops.\nI want to get on [CROSSTALK]\n\n95\n00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:52,580\n>> Go ahead and type in your favorite\n\n96\n00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,406\ngangster rap song.\n\n97\n00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, you know,\n\n98\n00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,940\nyou mentioned that Ronnie.\n\n99\n00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,900\n>> And, I was trying to be really witty,\nreally fast and I can't think of any.\n\n100\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,855\nI don't, I don't listen to the rap music.\n\n101\n00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,076\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Your favorite Michael Buble song then?\n\n102\n00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:05,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n103\n00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,595\nNow, if it were a Michael Bolton pass\n>> That's right.\n\n104\n00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:09,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now anyhow.\n\n105\n00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,750\nSo, if I did something like,\nI love the number 4.\n\n106\n00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,930\nAll right?\n\n107\n00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,650\nI just wrote a sentence.\n\n108\n00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,430\nIs that a complex sentence?\n\n109\n00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,970\nIs that a hard thing to remember?\n\n110\n00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,490\nIt's really easy, right?\n\n111\n00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,880\nBut, I've got uppercase letters.\n\n112\n00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,950\nI've got lower case letters.\n\n113\n00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,730\nI've got special characters,\nspaces, and the period.\n\n114\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,980\nI've got numbers.\n\n115\n00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,060\nI've got all the elements\nof a complex password.\n\n116\n00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,420\nAnd, how many characters did I type?\n\n117\n00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,682\nLet's see.\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n\n118\n00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:41,558\n14, 20.\n\n119\n00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,867\nThat is 20 characters exactly.\n\n120\n00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,250\nThat's a 20 character password.\n\n121\n00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,370\nWe normally couldn't\nhope to remember that.\n\n122\n00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,810\nBut here, I'm not having to remember each\nletter, I just have to remember the words.\n\n123\n00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,100\nI love the number 4.\n\n124\n00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,090\nIt's just, what, five words,\nthat's easy to remember.\n\n125\n00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,620\nAnd, this make life a lot more simple for\nus.\n\n126\n00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,350\nSo, coming up with a complex\npassword doesn't have to be hard.\n\n127\n00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,190\nThe problem is, a lot of systems may\nnot be geared up to handle this.\n\n128\n00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,100\nSome people won't let you use a,\na space in your password.\n\n129\n00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,960\nSome people will hold your password down.\n\n130\n00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,000\nYou see mainframes do this a lot,\nwhere they'll only do eight characters.\n\n131\n00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,220\nSo, that may happen and\nthat kinda changes this.\n\n132\n00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,850\nBut if you have the flexibility to choose,\nyou use something like this.\n\n133\n00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,610\nOr, you use a password management program.\n\n134\n00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,780\nYou can use services, like KeyPass,\nLastPass, 1 Password.\n\n135\n00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,060\nThese are all companies that help you\ncreated an encrypted password database\n\n136\n00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,880\nthat only you have the keys to.\n\n137\n00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,270\nAnd, you can assign insanely\ncomplex passwords, and\n\n138\n00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,560\nyou don't have to remember them cuz\nthey're stored in the database.\n\n139\n00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,340\nYou just have to remember one\npassword that unlocks your database.\n\n140\n00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,970\nThere are solutions out there to be\nsure that they are secured and tested.\n\n141\n00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,510\nYou don't want somebody getting\nyour whole password database.\n\n142\n00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,900\nThat would be bad.\n\n143\n00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,430\nThe other thing is don't\nreuse your password.\n\n144\n00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,150\nUse a different password on every site.\n\n145\n00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,470\nThat way if one site gets hacked and they\nsend you that notice saying, hey guys.\n\n146\n00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,320\nI'm sorry we got hacked,\nyou need to change your password.\n\n147\n00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,190\nRight?\nWell,\n\n148\n00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,170\nif you only use the password on that site,\n\n149\n00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,160\nthen you just change that password and\nthat's it.\n\n150\n00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520\nOr, or you do like I did with Yahoo!\n\n151\n00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,760\nwhen they emailed me, and\nyou just delete your account.\n\n152\n00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,970\nSo, you know,\nwhatever it is that you want to do.\n\n153\n00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,410\nBut, if you use that same\npassword on 50 other sites,\n\n154\n00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,610\nyou really gotta change them, all 50,\nbecause your password has now been\n\n155\n00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,500\nentered into a database the attackers\nare gonna be scanning against.\n\n156\n00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,510\nSo, they'll detect it more\nrapidly than other passwords.\n\n157\n00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,080\nSo, don't reuse passwords\nif you can avoid it.\n\n158\n00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,760\n>> Yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,490\nAnother thing that we also want to make\nsure that, that we do take advantage of\n\n160\n00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,390\nis the ability to change our\npasswords regularly too.\n\n161\n00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,800\nNow Don, I'm going to ask you a question.\n\n162\n00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,610\nYou don't really have to admit to this,\nbut do you have an email account that you\n\n163\n00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,130\nhaven't changed your password\non like in five years or so?\n\n164\n00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,940\n>> I have one account that's very\n\n165\n00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,510\nimportant to me-\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n166\n00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,530\n>> That I haven't changed\nthe password on in a long time,\n\n167\n00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,175\nbecause I do two factor\nidentification on it.\n\n168\n00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,670\n>> Right.\n>> So, it's the same password,\n\n169\n00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,545\nbut you have to have that other item too.\n\n170\n00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,562\n>> Yeah.\nEvery once in a while when I used to,\n\n171\n00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,384\nto teach these classes, I would ask.\n\n172\n00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,057\nAnd I would say, all right,\nwho has an email account for\n\n173\n00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:00,805\nlonger than ten years and\n\n174\n00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:02,776\nHalf the people would actually\nraise their hand I said all right-\n\n175\n00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:03,449\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n176\n00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,300\n>> Who's changed their\npassword in the last year?\n\n177\n00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,340\nAnd there would be one,\nmaybe two hands that would go up.\n\n178\n00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,310\nWell, imagine this.\n\n179\n00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,180\nNow they've got the same password\nthat you were using back in 2004.\n\n180\n00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,440\nAnd it's still the exact same password,\nand\n\n181\n00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,480\nhackers have essentially had ten years\nto hack against that one password.\n\n182\n00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,860\nChanging the passwords regularly\nis actually a key part\n\n183\n00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,970\nof keeping your password safe because it\ngives the hackers less chance, you know,\n\n184\n00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,810\nto, to again break your passwords, so\ntake advantage of that feature, too.\n\n185\n00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,850\n>> Definitely change your password,\nand how frequently is up to you, but\n\n186\n00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,860\nnormally 60 days, 90 days is probably\nabout as long as you wanna run on most of\n\n187\n00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,220\nthem, if you're gonna be entering\nthat password on the internet a lot.\n\n188\n00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,190\nYou know, definitely keep that changed.\n\n189\n00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,620\nAnother thing to note is that most\nsystems will give you a default password.\n\n190\n00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,410\nIt's real important to change that.\n\n191\n00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,800\nYou should never use a default password.\n\n192\n00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,060\nA great example I can give of this\nshould probably get me in trouble,\n\n193\n00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,490\nbut, when I first moved into my house.\n\n194\n00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,290\nThe house that I live in.\n\n195\n00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,170\nWe bought it, about eight years ago now.\n\n196\n00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,487\nSo, when we moved in noticed that, my\nwireless signal was a little weak and so\n\n197\n00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,160\nI did a, a site survey and...\n\n198\n00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,420\nMy neighbors on both sides have\nwireless access points, and\n\n199\n00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,990\nthey were both on channel 1, and I was\ngoing on channel 1, and so there was this,\n\n200\n00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,790\nyou know, conflict, we were all kind\nof broadcasting on the same channel,\n\n201\n00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,080\nwhich was weakening our wireless signals.\n\n202\n00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,900\nAnd so I, I kinda looked around at them,\nand I switched myself to channel 11, and\n\n203\n00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,740\nI was like, that's it,\nI've moved over, and that's that.\n\n204\n00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,970\nBut I noticed that one of my\nneighbors still had the default SSID.\n\n205\n00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,830\nAnd so\nI connected to their wireless network.\n\n206\n00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,550\nI knew what access point it was cuz\nthe SSID told me the brand, and\n\n207\n00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,110\nwas able to pull up the admin interface.\n\n208\n00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,290\nThey left it with default password so\nI just logged in and\n\n209\n00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,880\nmoved them to channel 6 so the three of\nus are now on three different channels.\n\n210\n00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,030\nSo I, I improved their network but\n\n211\n00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,610\nI was only able to do that because\nthey didn't change anything.\n\n212\n00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,730\nAnd I, I'm not the only one\nwho knows that secret, right?\n\n213\n00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,956\nA, any kind of war driver, you know,\nsomeone who's driving around looking for\n\n214\n00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,862\nall those networks can\nspot that type of thing.\n\n215\n00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,550\nChange your default password.\n\n216\n00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,430\nEven big companies have been hit by this.\n\n217\n00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,730\nVerizon got hit really bad a while back.\n\n218\n00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,750\nBecause when you setup a new\ncell phone account with them,\n\n219\n00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,990\nyour default voice-mail box password was\n1234, and attackers figured out that\n\n220\n00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,950\nthey could login to a mail box that hadn't\nbeen provisioned yet, and change the voice\n\n221\n00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,600\nmail message on it and then they could\nplace, collect, toll calls to it.\n\n222\n00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,710\nAnd, set the voice prompt to\nanswer to approve the charge.\n\n223\n00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,380\nAnd they could hold voice-mail open,\n\n224\n00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,970\nand rake in the dough on\nthese illegal toll numbers.\n\n225\n00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,130\nIt was a whole big thing about it,\n\n226\n00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,660\nthis was about eight years ago, it was\na little bit longer maybe ten years ago.\n\n227\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,230\nAnd so, now when you get a new voice-mail\nbox with Verizon, or AT&T, or whoever when\n\n228\n00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,890\nyou first get your phone, you can only\naccess the voice-mail from your phone.\n\n229\n00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,570\nNobody else can access it\nperiod until you set it up.\n\n230\n00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,710\nIt's cuz they're forcing you to\nchange that default password.\n\n231\n00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,552\nThat's real important.\n\n232\n00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,090\nAll right, what else is on our list Brian?\n\n233\n00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,750\nWe've got password confidentiality.\n\n234\n00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,370\n>> Oh, yep.\n\n235\n00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,680\n>> Do not share your password.\n\n236\n00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,880\nPeople get bad about this, right?\n\n237\n00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,280\nYou know, I, I need to get access\nto a file on my system, but I'm,\n\n238\n00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,430\nI'm not there and so I call up somebody at\nthe office and say, hey, I need you to do\n\n239\n00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,055\nsomething for me, can you can you go\nto my computer and, and log in as me.\n\n240\n00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,265\nHere's, here's my password.\n\n241\n00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,685\nAnd, and you tell them the password.\n\n242\n00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:21,495\nAnd now they know your password, too.\n\n243\n00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:25,205\nYou may trust them, but how do you know\nthat they're gonna keep that safe?\n\n244\n00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:27,975\nThat they're not gonna use that\npassword for other things?\n\n245\n00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:32,895\nAnd the one that I hate is you'll get the,\nthe manager that has an assistant or\n\n246\n00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:36,895\nreceptionist or whatever, and they say\nhey, I need you to check my email while\n\n247\n00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,800\nI'm out, so let me write my password down\nhere on this post-it note and we'll just\n\n248\n00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,280\nstick it on your monitor, and when you get\ntime, log into my account and check it.\n\n249\n00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,700\nWell, now your password is on display,\nit's just sitting there and\n\n250\n00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,790\npeople can see it!\n\n251\n00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,860\nSo you should never write\nyour password down,\n\n252\n00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,910\nyou should never share it with anybody.\n\n253\n00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,047\nPasswords are supposed to identify you,\nnot somebody else.\n\n254\n00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:00,516\n[SOUND] all right, password expiration,\npassword expiration is a technique we can\n\n255\n00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,709\nuse to force people to\nchange their passwords.\n\n256\n00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,165\nWhere if you're the person setting up\nthe website or the server you can say,\n\n257\n00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,440\nyou know what?\n\n258\n00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,220\nYou've got to change your password\nevery 60 days or every 90 days.\n\n259\n00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,450\nYour users will be resistant.\n\n260\n00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,450\nSometimes they won't want\nto change their password.\n\n261\n00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,070\nSo you can force them to do it and\nthat takes that out of the equation.\n\n262\n00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,652\nThey'll have to change their password or\nthey won't be able to login anymore.\n\n263\n00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:25,436\n[SOUND] All right, so those are all some\nof the things that we can take a look at\n\n264\n00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,794\nwhen, when it comes to\npassword management.\n\n265\n00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:31,832\nThe only other one that CompTIA calls\nout is awareness of single sign on, and\n\n266\n00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:34,370\nthis is one that's becoming\na bit of a problem.\n\n267\n00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,210\nWhen you log in to a website,\nit's not uncommon these days for\n\n268\n00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,730\nyou to log in to the site and\nit uses cookie based authentication.\n\n269\n00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,690\nSo now,\nyour work station is authenticated.\n\n270\n00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,030\nAnd you might close the web browser,\nbut you're still logged in.\n\n271\n00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,070\nThat cookie is still valid and somebody\nelse can come behind you and sit down and\n\n272\n00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,070\nlaunch up the webpage and\n\n273\n00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,130\ngo right back to that same site and\nthey are still logged in as you.\n\n274\n00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,990\nAll right.\n\n275\n00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,810\nThe reason they enable these functions\nthe things like single sign on is,\n\n276\n00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,010\nlet's use Google as an example.\n\n277\n00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,390\nSo i might log in to Gmail or YouTube or\n\n278\n00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,400\nGoogle Plus or any of a number of\nother services all offered by Google.\n\n279\n00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,928\nWell they don't want me to\nhave to log in every time.\n\n280\n00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:21,750\nSo if I log in to one,\n\n281\n00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,400\nit creates a token that sits on my\nsystem that shows that I'm logged in and\n\n282\n00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,140\nwhen I access the other services,\nit already knows who I am and I'm let in.\n\n283\n00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,470\nBut if I close all my windows,\n\n284\n00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,260\nthat has a negative effect so, if I walk\naway somebody else could go to Gmail or\n\n285\n00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,550\nYouTube or whatever and\nnow they're logged in as me.\n\n286\n00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,640\nAll right.\n\n287\n00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,280\nSo, how do we protect ourselves from that?\n\n288\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,970\nWell, you don't want to stop it because\nyou don't want to have to log in over and\n\n289\n00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,100\nover again every time you\naccess the services, but\n\n290\n00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,730\nthe thing you can do is one of two things.\n\n291\n00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,950\nOne, log out when you're done.\n\n292\n00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,840\nInstead of just closing that email window,\nhit the log out button.\n\n293\n00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,430\nThat will expire your token, and\nnow the token's no longer valid.\n\n294\n00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,670\nEven if you have other windows that\nare still open in the service,\n\n295\n00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,270\nif they click on any link it's gonna\nprompt them to authenticate again, right.\n\n296\n00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,380\nThe other thing is don't\nshare your work station.\n\n297\n00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,820\nIf you don't want to share\nyour work station, and\n\n298\n00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,920\nyou wanna stay logged in,\nlock your screen before you walk away.\n\n299\n00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,330\nEvery major operating system has\na way to lock the screen these days.\n\n300\n00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,530\nLock it and walk away.\n\n301\n00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,060\nAnd you know as a Windows user,\nwindows Key L.\n\n302\n00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,670\nI, I,It's just my habit.\n\n303\n00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,900\nEvery time I go to walk away from\na Windows machine I hit windows key L and\n\n304\n00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,590\nit locks the screen.\n\n305\n00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,140\nSo a keyboard shortcut you\ncan knock it right out.\n\n306\n00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,930\nOn my Mac I actually have a little lock\nicon that I added up to the title bar.\n\n307\n00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,450\nSo whenever I want to walk away, I can\njust hit that icon and lock my screen.\n\n308\n00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,740\nDifferent systems have\ndifferent shortcuts.\n\n309\n00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,820\nFind one and use it, or you can even\nset a screensaver to kick on after I,\n\n310\n00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,720\nidle activity to lock it for\nyou if you forget.\n\n311\n00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,377\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n312\n00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:50,531\nnow those are some of the things\nwe an do regarding our passwords.\n\n313\n00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,880\nWhat about the devices themselves.\n\n314\n00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,590\nOur laptops.\n\n315\n00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,900\nOur cell phones, our other devices.\n\n316\n00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,620\nWhat can we do for\nthem to increase their security.\n\n317\n00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,940\nOne of the basic things that you and\nI tend to do when we end up buying regular\n\n319\n00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,760\njust, everyday consumer items is it\nwe take it out and we use it and\n\n320\n00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,560\nonce we get it used, once we start using\nit, we don't think anything about it.\n\n321\n00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,050\nSo we leave what we call our,\nour regular default configuration.\n\n322\n00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,240\nAnd nobody calls it that.\n\n323\n00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,230\nBut it's a ready, ready to go so\nwe don't ever think about it.\n\n324\n00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,140\nBut one thing we can do is what\nwe call a device hardening.\n\n325\n00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,890\nAnd device hardening is just when we\ndon't leave anything at its default.\n\n326\n00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,740\nWe go back in, such as our wireless access\npoints and at least change the password.\n\n327\n00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,160\nWe go in and\nwe reconfigure something else so\n\n328\n00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,980\nit's not left at whatever\nthe default settings are and\n\n329\n00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,200\nthese are very important items, especially\nin this connected world that we do.\n\n330\n00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,260\n>> Now with hardening,\n\n331\n00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,420\nyou know, vendors have gotten a lot\nbetter today than they used to be.\n\n332\n00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,380\nIt used to be that when you installed\na new operating system it had tons of\n\n333\n00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,016\nnew features turned on and,\na lot of them you wouldn't even use.\n\n334\n00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:54,495\nSo, you would have features\nthat were enabled and running,\n\n335\n00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,670\nthat weakened the security of the system,\nand you weren't even using them.\n\n336\n00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,273\nSo, a lot of vendors have switched.\n\n337\n00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,576\nAnd now when you install\nan operating system or\n\n338\n00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:04,528\nbuy a new computer,\na lot of those features are turned off,\n\n339\n00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,200\nand if you want to use them\nyou've got to turn them on.\n\n340\n00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,360\nSo things like file sharing on\nthe network you know, your webcam,\n\n341\n00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,120\nthings of those nature, they,\nthey disable them by default and\n\n342\n00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,370\nyou just enable them to make use of them.\n\n343\n00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,965\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,850\nThat's a much more secure\nway of doing things.\n\n345\n00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,110\nThey call that shipping a hardened device.\n\n346\n00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,240\nBut not everybody does that.\n\n347\n00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,120\nIt may be something where you have to\ngo in and harden the device yourself.\n\n348\n00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,800\nSo you have to identify components\nthat you don't need and turn them off.\n\n349\n00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,400\nOkay?\n\n350\n00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,460\nA great example would be my,\nmy old cell phone had NFC in it,\n\n351\n00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,820\nthe Near Field Communications.\n\n352\n00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,480\nAnd I rarely use it, I, I bought some NFC\ntags and I goofed around with it a bit.\n\n353\n00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,660\nBut, I never found a reliable use for\nit on a regular basis.\n\n354\n00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,370\nBut, NFC allows you to communicate\nover very short distances,\n\n355\n00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,715\nand I didn't know a whole lot\nabout the protocol at the time.\n\n356\n00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:56,245\nI, I know a ton more now,\nbut, but then I didn't.\n\n357\n00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,895\nAnd so, I just turned it off.\n\n358\n00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,185\nI said, well, I don't need it,\nso let me just turn it off.\n\n359\n00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,155\nAnd later on I did what you did, Ronnie,\nwhich I swapped out the battery to one\n\n360\n00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:07,455\nthat, had a little more battery power and\nremoved the NFC antenna.\n\n361\n00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,595\nSo even if I forgot and turned it back on,\n\n362\n00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,485\nthe range was cut down\nto like a centimeter.\n\n363\n00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,455\nSo, so there's things like that,\nthat you can do.\n\n364\n00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:17,060\nYou just identify the components of\nyour system that you don't need and\n\n365\n00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,880\nturn them off.\n\n366\n00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,613\nThat is the easiest way\nto harden your system.\n\n367\n00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:24,175\n>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] really\nspecifically calls out bluetooth-.\n\n368\n00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And also NFC.\n\n369\n00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,310\nBluetooth is,\nis one of those things that when it's on,\n\n370\n00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,560\nit actively tries to seek\nsomething to pair with.\n\n371\n00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,410\nSo that sounds awesome, because it means\nyou and I don't really have to do a lot to\n\n372\n00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,480\nget another device to pair with it and\nit finds another device.\n\n373\n00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,150\nBut if you're at Disney World, or\n\n374\n00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,940\nyou're walking in the street, somebody's\nactually constantly following you,\n\n375\n00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,090\nthey're trying to pair up the device,\nthere is a possibility.\n\n376\n00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,240\nSo if you're not using Bluetooth,\n\n377\n00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,825\nprobably the easiest thing to do, just\ndisable it, don't worry about, you know,\n\n378\n00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:56,475\ntrying to, to protect it, just turn\nit off, is, is pretty much the key.\n\n379\n00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,645\n>> And Comtia really recommends that for\nany, if you have executives,\n\n380\n00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,155\nanybody with sensitive data on their\nphone, if you're gonna be traveling in\n\n381\n00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:04,215\nyour areas where you're not\nin controlled environments-.\n\n382\n00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,725\n>> Turn it off.\n>> They recommend turning both\n\n383\n00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:06,225\nof those off, yeah.\n\n384\n00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,960\nBluetooth and NFC.\n\n385\n00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,955\nAll right, other things we can do, like,\nI kind of already mentioned this next one.\n\n386\n00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,265\nTime out and lock options.\n\n387\n00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,315\nSo, the lock options,\nthat's where we lock our screen.\n\n388\n00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:18,100\nIf somebody else wants to use\nthe computer, they have to log in.\n\n389\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,870\nA time out, that's where if\nwe forget to lock the screen.\n\n390\n00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,980\nIf we walk away from our computer,\nour computer is sitting there idle.\n\n391\n00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,300\nIdle time is anytime you're\nnot using your system.\n\n392\n00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,020\nAnd as you sit long enough, you can\nset it to kick in and lock the screen.\n\n393\n00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,340\nNow some OS's will do that independently.\n\n394\n00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,690\nBut most of them do it in\nconjunction with a screen saver.\n\n395\n00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,970\nSo you configure a screen saver, and\nyou say kick on after five minutes of,\n\n396\n00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,530\nof inactivity and then tell it\nto require a password to unlock.\n\n397\n00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,040\nAnd now if you walk away, your computer\nsits idle for five minutes, and then\n\n398\n00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,310\nthe screen locks and if somebody wants to\nuse your system they'll have to unlock it.\n\n399\n00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,180\nThose options are pretty\nsimple to configure.\n\n400\n00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,160\nLet me show you here in Windows,\nI'll fire one up here.\n\n401\n00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,620\nSo if I go into my,\nmy Windows 7 machine here,\n\n402\n00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,790\nI'm just gonna personalize this thing.\n\n403\n00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,930\nAnd you'll find in here that I,\nI don't have a screen saver right now, but\n\n404\n00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,360\nI'm gonna go into that.\n\n405\n00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,380\nAnd I can tell it to do a screen saver.\n\n406\n00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,750\nI, I don't normally turn one on,\n\n407\n00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,960\nbecause I don't want it going\nto sleep during the show.\n\n408\n00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,140\nBut, so i'll turn on, we, we,\nwe'll do the annoying bubbles.\n\n409\n00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,760\nSo I'll choose Bubbles.\n\n410\n00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,500\nAnd I'm gonna set it to three minutes.\n\n411\n00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,690\nSo if my computer sits idle for three\nminutes, the screen saver will come on.\n\n412\n00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,380\nAnd all I have to do is\ncheck this right here.\n\n413\n00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,950\nOn resume display logon screen.\n\n414\n00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,800\nThat means If my computer sits idle for\nthree minutes, the screen is gonna lock,\n\n415\n00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,980\nand in order to get back in,\nI'm gonna have to provide my password.\n\n416\n00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,660\nSo, if I forget and leave myself\nlogged in and walk away, I'm covered.\n\n417\n00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,480\nUnless the attacker is really fast and\n\n418\n00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,365\njumps in my chair within three minutes,\nhopefully I would notice.\n\n419\n00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,500\nAll right.\nI, I guess I, I,\n\n420\n00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,330\nI don't think it activates on the preview,\ndoes it.\n\n421\n00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,690\nLet's see if it does.\n\n422\n00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,850\nNo it doesn't.\nYeah the preview doesn't activate the,\n\n423\n00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,570\nthe lock screen.\n\n424\n00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,930\nBut If we were more patient than I am and\n\n425\n00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,292\nwaited three minutes then\nwe'd see that kick in.\n\n426\n00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,370\nAll right, so, so\nthose are some of the things we can do.\n\n427\n00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,340\nThe next one they call\nout are your software and\n\n428\n00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,310\nsecurity features that\nare built into your system.\n\n429\n00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,560\nMost operating systems have\nsecurity features built in to\n\n430\n00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,310\nhelp secure your system.\n\n431\n00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,600\nBut they may not be turned on by default,\nor they might be turned on and\n\n432\n00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,880\nthey just need to tailor\nthem a little bit.\n\n433\n00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n434\n00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,430\nIn Windows we talk about\nthe Windows Firewall,\n\n435\n00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,430\nit's been around at\nleast since Windows XP,\n\n436\n00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,610\nI don't know it if was actually around\neven earlier than that, do you remember?\n\n437\n00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,380\n>> No, yeah, they,\n\n438\n00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,500\nthey released it with Windows XP\nService Pack Two is when that came out.\n\n439\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,380\nAnd prior to that,\n\n440\n00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,530\nyou used third party software\n>> Yeah.\n\n441\n00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,210\nSo with the, the firewall, this is really\nour anti-intrusion detection software\n\n442\n00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,010\nthat allows us to know when somebody's\ntrying to put stuff onto our computer.\n\n443\n00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,280\nAnd it really does help,\n\n444\n00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,720\nbecause it will block that stuff\nfrom getting onto our computer.\n\n445\n00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,950\nBut also, we want to make sure that we\nrun also run anti-malware of some sort.\n\n446\n00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,790\nSome type of of anti-virus software,\nwhether its the Windows Defender in\n\n447\n00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,200\ntoday's, Windows operating system, or any\nother third party software that you'd like\n\n448\n00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,720\nto actually run, so not only are we\nprotecting ourselves by turning it off,\n\n449\n00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,840\nbecause somebody can't\nget access that way.\n\n450\n00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,740\nBut when our systems are running, we wanna\nmake sure that we're at least doing these\n\n451\n00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,210\nthings to protect ourselves while\nour computers are on and running.\n\n452\n00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,360\n>> And don't assume that\nthe firewall's configured properly.\n\n453\n00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,270\nRight?\nMicrosoft does various settings they\n\n454\n00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,950\nput in their firewall\nby default that may or\n\n455\n00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,110\nmay not match up with your expectations,\nso check on it.\n\n456\n00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,720\nAll right?\nA firewall at it's heart,\n\n457\n00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,935\nis really just It's just a filter.\n\n458\n00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:34,075\nIt looks at your network traffic, and it\nsays, this traffic's allowed to pass and\n\n459\n00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,015\nthis traffic is not allowed to pass.\n\n460\n00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,385\nAnd it does that with these rules.\n\n461\n00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:42,125\nSo Microsoft has predefined a series\nof rules that identify what is allowed.\n\n462\n00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,700\nYou should review it.\n\n463\n00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,690\nBe familiar with it.\n\n464\n00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,730\nIf it's your personal computer, you don't\ntypically have to mess with it much.\n\n465\n00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,990\nBut in a corporate environment,\nyou may want to retool that quite a bit.\n\n466\n00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,295\nAnd I, I'll just show you,\nhere, as a, quick examples.\n\n467\n00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:55,220\nI'll, I'll go back to\nmy Windows 7 machine.\n\n468\n00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,940\nThis is pretty much a stock install,\nI haven't done much to it.\n\n469\n00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,540\nI installed Chrome and, and\na few screen sharing programs.\n\n470\n00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,382\nBut if I pull up the firewall\nconfiguration of this one,\n\n471\n00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:09,620\nall right, I can see that\nthe Windows firewall is on, so\n\n472\n00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,370\nI got my nice little green lights here,\nletting me know that it's on.\n\n473\n00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,560\nAnd if I go into my firewall\nconfiguration, I have not changed\n\n474\n00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,940\nany of the rules myself, so what we should\nsee here are the default Microsoft rules.\n\n475\n00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,800\nAnd we can see a lot of stuff is added and\nactually it looks like my software has\n\n476\n00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,190\nadded Airplay, and BonJour, IBJ,\nthat's all my screen saving software.\n\n477\n00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,670\nI mean my screen sharing software.\n\n478\n00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,290\nBut after that you can see some other\nthings in here like core networking for\n\n479\n00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,350\ndestination reachable messages IPB6,\nnetwork discovery.\n\n480\n00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,790\nThese are things used for\nbasic network communications.\n\n481\n00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,070\nWe need those or\nour network is not going to work.\n\n482\n00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,880\nWell, that's not always true.\n\n483\n00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,322\nMaybe I don't use IPV6,\nmaybe I only use IPV4.\n\n484\n00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:58,830\nWell, IPV6 is turned on and\nenabled in Windows by default, and\n\n485\n00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,950\nthe firewall rules are there.\n\n486\n00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,380\nSo I might wanna harden this even more,\ngo and turn off some of these rules,\n\n487\n00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,500\nif I know I'm not gonna use IPV6.\n\n488\n00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,330\nSee how some of these rules have\nlittle gray check marks on them?\n\n489\n00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,880\nThat means those rules are turned off.\n\n490\n00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880\nThey're here, but\nthey're not actually running, right?\n\n491\n00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,490\nSo all this File and Printer Sharing\nstuff, I haven't turned on file and\n\n492\n00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,447\nprinter sharing.\n\n493\n00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:20,290\nAll right.\n\n494\n00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,550\nBut if I go and enable that.\n\n495\n00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,110\nLet's go and turn that on.\n\n496\n00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,410\nSo if I go in on my network and\nsharing center, and\n\n497\n00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,670\nwhere do we tell it to turn that on,\nRonnie?\n\n498\n00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,551\n>> Go to Advanced Sharing.\n\n499\n00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,330\nChange Sharing Settings.\n\n500\n00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,770\n>> There we go.\n\n501\n00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,060\nSo I can turn on File and\nPrinter Sharing, right?\n\n502\n00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,430\nI am going to go ahead and turn that on,\nso now I am able to share files and\n\n503\n00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,830\nprinters and if I come in here and refresh\nthis, what we'll see is all of those\n\n504\n00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,950\nrules, not necessarily all of them,\nbut many of them, just turned on.\n\n505\n00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,617\nSee these guys right\nhere that I'm clicking?\n\n506\n00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:55,628\nThese guys are all on now and\nthat's because I just enabled File and\n\n507\n00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:59,291\nPrinter Sharing, so\nThat's what Microsoft understands.\n\n508\n00:23:59,291 --> 00:23:59,951\nThey say, look,\n\n509\n00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,950\nyou don't need these firewall rules\nunless you're actually going to use that.\n\n510\n00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,360\nAnd so it's tailoring it.\n\n511\n00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,510\nBut even some of the default ones might\nbe beyond what your use case scenario is.\n\n512\n00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,010\nAnd you also have to be careful that when\nyou go and turn things off, so if I go and\n\n513\n00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,150\nturn off File and\nprinter sharing, all right?\n\n514\n00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,640\nI'll go and save that so\nit's now turned off.\n\n515\n00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,920\nYou always need to double check and\n\n516\n00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,820\nmake sure that the rules\nhave been turned off too.\n\n517\n00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,860\nBecause what can happen is you\ncan turn the service off and\n\n518\n00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,760\nthe rules might still be there.\n\n519\n00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,810\nAnd down the road you install some other\nsoftware that listens on the same port,\n\n520\n00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,790\nand now it's open and\nyou're not aware of it.\n\n521\n00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,140\nSo, always review that.\n\n522\n00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,590\nDon't trust that the vendors are going\nto take care of that for you.\n\n523\n00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,420\nThere may be stuff in here that you\ndon't want to have added, all right?\n\n524\n00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,322\nSo, just keep that in mind as you work\nwith whatever your software firewall is.\n\n525\n00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:52,950\n>> All right Ronnie that is,\nwell, let's do the one more,\n\n526\n00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,560\nthere's only one more for this little one.\n\n527\n00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,840\nI know we're, we're low on time, but\n\n528\n00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,160\nlet's do this one more then we'll stop and\ntake a break.\n\n529\n00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,200\nThe last one they have for\ndevice hardening is encryption, all right?\n\n530\n00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,460\nEncrypt your data.\n\n531\n00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,040\nScreen locks, complex passwords all\nof those various settings like that,\n\n532\n00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,625\nfirewall rules,\n\n533\n00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,425\nnone of those work if somebody steals\nthe hard drive out of your computer.\n\n534\n00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,665\nIf they just go and\ngrab the hard drive right out of it and\n\n535\n00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:19,955\nrun out of the building,\nthey can take that hard drive and\n\n536\n00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:23,392\nstick it on their computer as a second\nhard drive, on their own computer.\n\n537\n00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:25,892\nSo, when they log in, they're logging\ninto their own computer, not yours.\n\n538\n00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,192\nSo, they don't need to use\nthe internet password.\n\n539\n00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,242\nAnd they're not going over the network,\nso they're not gonna hit your firewall.\n\n540\n00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:33,207\nAnd their not gonna hit your antivirus,\n\n541\n00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,721\ncase it's not running,\nit's just sitting there on the hard drive.\n\n542\n00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:38,151\nThey bypass everything.\n\n543\n00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:41,381\nNow they have physical access\nto the drive and your data.\n\n544\n00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:44,921\nSo, the only way to prevent that\nscenario to protect that data\n\n545\n00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,701\nis to encrypt the drives.\n\n546\n00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:50,111\nIf you encrypt your data,\nsure they've got it but its encrypted.\n\n547\n00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:50,961\nThey can't read it.\n\n548\n00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:51,766\nThey can't use it.\n\n549\n00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,870\nIt's useless to them, all right.\n\n550\n00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,560\nSo you need to make sure you do that.\n\n551\n00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,910\nIf you're handling any kind of financial,\nmedical,\n\n552\n00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,110\nor just personal information you don't\nwant out there, encrypt your drive.\n\n553\n00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,580\n>> Yeah, the drive encryptions that\nwe use today are much strong and\n\n554\n00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,990\nmuch more powerful than\nthey were in the past.\n\n555\n00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,420\nAnd, it is recommended\nusage just about everyone\n\n556\n00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,710\nsingle security place that\nyou go to on the internet.\n\n557\n00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,080\nThey'll tell you you've gotta encrypt your\ndata today because it's very easy for\n\n558\n00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,180\nsomebody to simply just\nwalk off with my laptop and\n\n559\n00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,330\nI might not even know that it's happened.\n\n560\n00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,030\nSteal it right out of the backseat\nof my car, you name it.\n\n561\n00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,190\nBut, by having this drive encryption, even\nthough I may have lost the laptop itself,\n\n562\n00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,380\nor the hard drive itself, when they try\nand plug it in, now they try and do what,\n\n563\n00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,110\nwhat Don was describing such,\nconnecting it to their own computer.\n\n564\n00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,590\nWhen the device kicks on,\nit's gonna ask for\n\n565\n00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,794\nan encryption key to decrypt that,\nand they shouldn't have that.\n\n566\n00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:45,469\nAnd if they don't have it, then they\nwon't be able to see the information and\n\n567\n00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,970\nthat protects you.\n\n568\n00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,590\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah.\n\n569\n00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,810\n>> All right, so, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n570\n00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,390\nWe do have more security best practices\nto cover before we are all said and\n\n571\n00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,610\ndone but let's stop here and take a\nbreather and when we get back we are going\n\n572\n00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,590\nto move a little bit into Wi-Fi\nsecurity and a few other things.\n\n573\n00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,620\nWe still have suspicious emails and\nsome other things to tackle so stay tuned.\n\n574\n00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,141\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n575\n00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:15,790\n[MUSIC]\n\n576\n00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,700\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n577\n00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,180\nSo, for the next part we need to talk\nabout a few other technologies and\n\n578\n00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,240\nwe're gonna kick off talking about Wi-Fi,\nor wireless network access.\n\n579\n00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,680\nIt's pretty much a given these days,\nwhenever you go to a hotel or a coffee\n\n580\n00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,520\nshop, a restaurant most of the time\nthey provide wireless internet access.\n\n581\n00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,350\nAnd at home, you probably have a wireless\nrouter also that's providing the internet\n\n582\n00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,520\naccess in your house.\n\n583\n00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,080\nAnd it's great,\nit's nice to not have cables and, and\n\n584\n00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,060\nyou get your phone hooked up, your laptop,\n\n585\n00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,330\nyour tablets, and they all have internet\naccess and it works really well.\n\n586\n00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,520\nBut there's a couple of things that we\nneed to remember about wireless networks.\n\n587\n00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,400\nIf you connect to a wireless network and\nit does not prompt you for\n\n588\n00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,788\na password, that means you're\non an open Wi-Fi network.\n\n589\n00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:02,970\nAn open Wi-Fi network is unencrypted and\nit's pretty much how you're gonna\n\n590\n00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,870\nsee it when you go to a hotel or\na coffee shop or whatever.\n\n591\n00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,400\nThey don't want to require\na password because, well,\n\n592\n00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,380\nthey don't want to tell everybody.\n\n593\n00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,420\nThey just want you to get on there.\n\n594\n00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,110\nIt's free internet and off you go.\n\n595\n00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,820\nAll right?\n\n596\n00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,110\nVersus when it prompts for a password.\n\n597\n00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,940\nIn that case there,\nthere's two things, right?\n\n598\n00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,520\nOne, they're making sure that only\napproved people are gaining access to\n\n599\n00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,390\nthat network.\n\n600\n00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,400\nAnd two,\n\n601\n00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,940\nthat password is used as an encryption\nkey to secure your communications.\n\n602\n00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,680\nSo, actually doing encryption.\n\n603\n00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,940\nNow, why is encryption important\non a wireless network?\n\n604\n00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,970\nThe main reason is,\n\n605\n00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,810\nwhen you communicate on a wireless\nnetwork, it's wireless, right?\n\n606\n00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,500\nYour laptop doesn't actually\nknow where the access point is.\n\n607\n00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,840\nWhen your laptop sends\nout a wireless signal,\n\n608\n00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,750\nit sends the same signal\nin a 360 degree radius.\n\n609\n00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,150\nSo the axis point could be that way and\n\n610\n00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,820\nI'm sending just as strong a signal that\nway as I am that way, and that way, and\n\n611\n00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,380\nthat way, and\nall the various ways that signal could go.\n\n612\n00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,882\nDude, your laptop doesn't differentiate.\n\n613\n00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,350\nAnd it's wireless,\nyou are throwing it in the air.\n\n614\n00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,500\nAnd so an attacker could be sitting\nthere with a laptop of their own and\n\n615\n00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,220\ncapturing wireless packets.\n\n616\n00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,530\nJust sitting there capturing it.\n\n617\n00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,890\nYou wouldn't even know it was happening.\n\n618\n00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,080\nYour traffic does hit the antenna and then\ngoes out to the internet and back again.\n\n619\n00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,110\nThe attacker is just capturing\nairwaves and recording them.\n\n620\n00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,030\nAnd then they can recreate\nyour entire conversation as\n\n621\n00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,490\nwell as the conversations of anyone\nelse on that wireless network.\n\n622\n00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,580\nOpen wireless networks are not to\nbe trusted under any circumstances.\n\n623\n00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,540\nEven if it's provided by\na company you trust, all right?\n\n624\n00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,633\nIf you were to come here\nto the IT ProTV studios and\n\n625\n00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:42,866\nwe gave you a open Wi-Fi network to use,\nyou shouldn't trust it.\n\n626\n00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,224\nNow we, we know security,\nyou can trust us, right?\n\n627\n00:29:45,224 --> 00:29:46,840\nWe're not gonna mess with your data.\n\n628\n00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,615\nI, I promise.\n\n629\n00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:51,180\n[LAUGH] But but what you can't trust is\n\n630\n00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,970\nother people that might be sitting out in\nthe parking lot that have access to that\n\n631\n00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,460\nwireless signal that you don't\neven know were there, right?\n\n632\n00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,160\nWe don't know are there.\n\n633\n00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,120\nI don't know who's out in\nthe parking lot right now.\n\n634\n00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,870\nAnd that wireless signal\nbleeds beyond our walls.\n\n635\n00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,970\nIt goes out into the parking\nlot quite a bit.\n\n636\n00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,270\nSo, that's where we have\nto be really careful.\n\n637\n00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,130\nOn a secured wireless network,\none with a password, you may or\n\n638\n00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,470\nmay not be able to rely on the,\nthe encryption there too.\n\n639\n00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,130\nThere's more than one wireless security\nstandard that are out there and\n\n640\n00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,460\nsome are not very strong.\n\n641\n00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,690\nSo, for example, there's, there's WEP,\nthe Wired Equivalency Protocol, WEP.\n\n642\n00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,330\nThat one's been broken.\n\n643\n00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,040\nIt takes all of two minutes to\ndecrypt somebody's traffic that's been\n\n644\n00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,020\nencrypted with WEP.\n\n645\n00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,800\nIs not secure and is not to be trusted.\n\n646\n00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,410\nThere's WPA.\n\n647\n00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,010\nWi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n648\n00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,410\nThere are several known exploits\nin its default encryption.\n\n649\n00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,550\nAnd so, it's not to be trusted.\n\n650\n00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,910\nThere's WPA2.\n\n651\n00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,100\nIt's the best.\n\n652\n00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,030\nIt hasn't been exploited.\n\n653\n00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,729\nWell not in in a practical sense.\n\n654\n00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,092\nBut, it's really just a matter of\ntime before that one gets broken and\n\n655\n00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:56,211\nas people's computers become more advanced\nthen that one's gonna become week too.\n\n656\n00:30:56,211 --> 00:31:00,881\nSo my recommendation, and what I do,\nis regardless of the wireless network,\n\n657\n00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,020\nI do not trust it.\n\n658\n00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,450\nI do not trust wireless networks period.\n\n659\n00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,950\nAnd so, when I use a wireless network,\nI take my laptop,\n\n660\n00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,940\nI connect to the wireless network,\nand then I build a VPN tunnel over it.\n\n661\n00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,180\nI do a Virtual Private Network.\n\n662\n00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,520\nI encrypt my own data and\nI reach out to my home or the office or,\n\n663\n00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,900\nor whatever it is I'm trying to\nconnect to with the secure tunnel, and\n\n664\n00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,170\nI flow all my traffic across that.\n\n665\n00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,690\nThat's truly, you are the only\nperson you can trust, right?\n\n666\n00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,200\nThat, I know it's paranoid or\nwhatever, but that,\n\n667\n00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,280\nthat, that is really true when it\ncomes to wireless networks, all right.\n\n668\n00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,410\nThe exception is, for\n\n669\n00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,920\nme at home, my wireless network at home\nwhere, I know it's set up properly.\n\n670\n00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,960\nI know I'm doing WPA2.\n\n671\n00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,810\nI know that I have\nfollowed my processes but\n\n672\n00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,570\nyou can't trust other people to do that.\n\n673\n00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,790\nSo, Wi-Fi networks are,\nare not necessarily to be trusted.\n\n674\n00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,240\nNow how, how do we know the difference\nbetween open Wi-Fi and secure Wi-Fi?\n\n675\n00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,349\nUsually just a password, right?\n\n676\n00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,231\nWhen they prompt for a password.\n\n677\n00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:55,544\nMost operating systems these days will\nactually show it graphically, like,\n\n678\n00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:58,450\nyou can look at my laptop here You know,\nI'm, I'm on a mac, and\n\n679\n00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,827\nI can see, I've got my little\nwireless symbol up here.\n\n680\n00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:02,710\nAnd I can see wireless\nnetworks that are near me.\n\n681\n00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,670\nAnd as I look down the list,\nI can see here's two, well,\n\n682\n00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,520\nthese are just HP printers, I guess.\n\n683\n00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,760\nBut these are not secure,\nthere's no lock beside them.\n\n684\n00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,330\nSo anything I send to those two guys.\n\n685\n00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,190\nIs gonna be just out in the clear.\n\n686\n00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,080\nPeople are gonna intercept it.\n\n687\n00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,470\nNow if I'm using SSL you know, Secure\nSocket Layer to browse to a website,\n\n688\n00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,070\nI might be encrypting other way, but\non the wireless side I'm not encrypting.\n\n689\n00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,804\nAnd then the other networks we see there,\nthey all have locks, right?\n\n690\n00:32:28,804 --> 00:32:33,440\nSo our, our that we have here in\nthe studio, our various other networks,\n\n691\n00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,580\nour public networks, our studio network,\nthey've all got locks, right?\n\n692\n00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,150\nSo they're all doing WPA2, we require that\nlevel of encryption on our networks and\n\n693\n00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,650\nthey're pretty safe to use.\n\n694\n00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:48,410\nBut if I'm in a hotel even if they use\nWPA2, I usually still turn around and\n\n695\n00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,400\ndo a VPN tunnel just because\nI don't trust the network.\n\n696\n00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,120\nThat, that's really what it\nall comes down to, is trust.\n\n697\n00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,178\nAll right.\nWhat's next on our list, Ronnie?\n\n698\n00:32:57,178 --> 00:33:00,440\n>> We've got multi-factor\nauthentication which is the next\n\n699\n00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,690\nlittle bit of security best\npractice that we can use.\n\n700\n00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,940\nMost of the time when we think that\na password is not as strong, but\n\n701\n00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,710\nwhat would make it even\nstronger is the ability for\n\n702\n00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,950\nus to actually use not only a password but\nalso something else too.\n\n703\n00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,250\nSo you may think about what\nwe call bio-metrics and\n\n704\n00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,000\nmaybe a fingerprint scanner\nalong with a password.\n\n705\n00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,412\nOr it may even be a pin number and\na smart card.\n\n706\n00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:28,480\nThat you combine together to\nensure that if you're missing one,\n\n707\n00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120\nyou're still not gonna\nbe able to access in.\n\n708\n00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,009\nSo we were mentioning this a little bit\nearlier, and Don, you were telling us\n\n709\n00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,164\nabout an email account that you use, that\neven though you, you have a password, and\n\n710\n00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,052\nyou haven't actually changed it in years-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n711\n00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:42,350\n>> You still have a second factor that\nreally does help protect that account.\n\n712\n00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,580\n>> Yeah, and you can use all\nsorts of things these days.\n\n713\n00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,890\nIt used to be complex,\non the one I was talking about,\n\n714\n00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,940\nI used the Google authenticator and so I\nhave a code that changes every 30 seconds.\n\n715\n00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,980\nAnd so when I login, I have my password\nthat really has been the same for\n\n716\n00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,690\na long, long time.\n\n717\n00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,070\nAnd then I've got this code\nthat changes every 30 seconds.\n\n718\n00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,990\nSo when you ask, when's the last\ntime I changed my password?\n\n719\n00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,000\nTechnically I change it every 30 seconds.\n\n720\n00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120\nNot bad, right.\n\n721\n00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,480\nSo those types of systems, Google\nAuthiticator, RSA SecureID Tokens, UBPs,\n\n722\n00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,686\nthose are all methods for\ndoing rapid changing passwords,\n\n723\n00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:14,173\nthey're very effective.\n\n724\n00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:14,716\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n725\n00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:18,970\nyou're also seeing some companies\ngo to something a lot less painful.\n\n726\n00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,300\nThose systems, hey, I'm an IT guy,\nit's easy for me to set up, but\n\n727\n00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,390\nit's very hard for your typical end user.\n\n728\n00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,360\nSo we use a little something less painful.\n\n729\n00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,000\nFacebook actually has\na really good system.\n\n730\n00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,860\nMicrosoft does the same thing,\nwhere they use your cellphone.\n\n731\n00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,490\nWhen you log in to Facebook, or\nyou log into your Outlook.com account\n\n732\n00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,070\nfrom a new computer, you can turn\non two factor authentication so\n\n733\n00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,210\nthat when you login, it then sends a code\nvia text message, to your cellphone.\n\n734\n00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,060\nSo you login with your username and\npassword, like normal.\n\n735\n00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,790\nAnd then it texts your cellphone,\nand it tells you a code.\n\n736\n00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,650\nAnd you then go and login.\n\n737\n00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,810\nYou punch in that code,\nand it lets you in.\n\n738\n00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,620\nBut without that code,\nit won't let you in.\n\n739\n00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,300\nSo if somebody captured my username and\npassword somehow,\n\n740\n00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,570\nthey wouldn't be able to login without my\nphone, and I do that for a few, accounts.\n\n741\n00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,750\nActually my, my Outlook.com,\nmore than once,\n\n742\n00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,710\njust in the middle of the day, I received\na text message that said here's your code.\n\n743\n00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,820\nAnd I know what happened,\n\n744\n00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,140\nsomebody tried to log in as me and\nthey didn't have the code.\n\n745\n00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,530\nNow it could've been an attacker or\nit could've been something I was doing,\n\n746\n00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,330\nyou know, maybe I did log on a new system,\n\n747\n00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,610\nmaybe I left a window open somewhere but\nyou get that code and\n\n748\n00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,500\nyou know, right, I don't need to log in,\nsomebody tried to get in and it failed.\n\n749\n00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,805\nSo that's that's a nice system to have\nin place, a nice little safety measure.\n\n750\n00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:34,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n751\n00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,205\nWe also want to talk about\nsuspicious emails, too.\n\n752\n00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:38,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n753\n00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,970\n>> The very fact is,\n\n754\n00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,250\nif you get an email from someone\n>> And you see an attachment there and\n\n755\n00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,720\nyou don't know who it is do not open it.\n\n756\n00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,690\nIt is, is really what,\nwhat we wanna make sure of.\n\n757\n00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,690\nSo whenever you see some type of email and\nyou're already suspicious about it you go,\n\n758\n00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,575\nyou don't tend to go okay, well let me\njust go ahead and see what that's about.\n\n759\n00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:57,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can, but\n\n760\n00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,630\nit may actually bring more surprises and\nsome type of virus or\n\n761\n00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,210\ntrojan that may get access to your system.\n\n762\n00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,190\n>> And we, we talked a little bit about,\nabout email in the 3.1 objectives,\n\n763\n00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,080\nso you guys have already\nkind of heard some of this.\n\n764\n00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,280\nBut always be careful\nwith links in an email.\n\n765\n00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,530\nJust because the link\nsays it goes to one site,\n\n766\n00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,010\nthat just might be the text they typed in.\n\n767\n00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,020\nIf you float your mouse over it,\nyou'll see where it actually goes and\n\n768\n00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,600\noftentimes it can be\na completely different place.\n\n769\n00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,320\nThat's a, a tool that a lot\nof phishing attacks use, so\n\n770\n00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,330\nbe aware of where a link goes before\nyou click on it, all right, and\n\n771\n00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,110\nthen attachments, it's tough to,\nto trust attachments.\n\n772\n00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,855\nNever open an attachment from\nsomeone that you don't recognize.\n\n773\n00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:36,415\nRight?\n\n774\n00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:38,815\nYou, you just,\nyou don't know what's in there.\n\n775\n00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:40,185\nIt could be visual basic script.\n\n776\n00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:41,615\nIt could be an executable.\n\n777\n00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:42,805\nIt could be all sorts of stuff.\n\n778\n00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,925\nHey, it could be a, a virus typically.\n\n779\n00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:47,675\nAnd when you open that\nattachment that's it.\n\n780\n00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:50,615\nI don't know if you guys remember the,\nthe Anna Kournikova virus, right?\n\n781\n00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:51,825\nThat was a, a funny one.\n\n782\n00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:55,095\nCause it, it was an email that was\nframed to say that it had some,\n\n783\n00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:57,340\ninappropriate pictures of Anna Kournikova.\n\n784\n00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,680\nAnd people really like her, so\npeople opened that attachment, and\n\n785\n00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,980\nit was a virus, and\nthat virus spread very, very quickly.\n\n786\n00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,720\nWhich I think, was that, that was actually\ncalled I Love You virus, wasn't it?\n\n787\n00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,570\n>> It was an older one that\nwas called I Love You.\n\n788\n00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,800\nIt could be that, that they renamed that.\n\n789\n00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,770\n>> They might have been the same.\n\n790\n00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,870\nWell, well anyhow, the point is that\npeople opened those pictures like crazy,\n\n791\n00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,050\nand that virus spread super mega fast.\n\n792\n00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,280\nSo that's what happens when you open an\nattachment from someone you don't trust.\n\n793\n00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,000\nAnd don't just trust like, a, a file type.\n\n794\n00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,130\nDon't say, oh, it's a PDF,\nthat can't hurt you.\n\n795\n00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,130\nWell, PDFs can have embedded scripts,\n\n796\n00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,815\nsay active little applets so\nwhatever inside of it.\n\n797\n00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:35,085\nAnd so, you can do powerful stuff,\nincluding virus-like activities.\n\n798\n00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:38,415\nIt could be a word document that\nhas a malicious macro in it.\n\n799\n00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:42,245\nThat became so common, that Microsoft\ndisables macros by default now.\n\n800\n00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:43,490\nThat's how bad it got.\n\n801\n00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,120\nSo there's a lot of\nprotections on your system but\n\n802\n00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,815\nyou shouldn't let it get to that point.\n\n803\n00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:50,940\nDon't open attachments from\npeople that you don't know.\n\n804\n00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,220\n>> Yeah, in, in our chat, David mentions\nthat be, be careful also of the phrase,\n\n805\n00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,562\ndear user-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n806\n00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:58,090\n>> Today they're, they are giving you\n\n807\n00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,950\na smarter word or they'll figure out\nwhat the name of the email account and\n\n808\n00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,310\nif your name is actually on it,\nthey are only gonna take that\n\n809\n00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,800\nportion of the name and put it in there,\nso it's a great one for\n\n810\n00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,325\nus to actually think about but remember,\nthat they're getting smarter everyday.\n\n811\n00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:11,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n812\n00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,030\n>> So you've also got to pay\nattention to even things like that.\n\n813\n00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,460\nBecause I know I get so many and\nI know it's, it's not really for\n\n814\n00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,690\nme when they call me Ron, or\nRonald, there, there's just no way.\n\n815\n00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,410\nNobody calls me that,\nthey always call me Ronnie,\n\n816\n00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,140\nso I know it's not from someone I know.\n\n817\n00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,440\n>> Yup.\n\n818\n00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,230\nOur next entry is just to act\non security software alerts.\n\n819\n00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,300\nRight.\nWe need to know when something's\n\n820\n00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,370\nwrong with our security configuration and\nwe need to take action on it.\n\n821\n00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,520\nAnd one of the ways is,\nis through security alerts.\n\n822\n00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,890\nYour system will actually warn you\nwhen something is about to to go bad.\n\n823\n00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,470\nSo let me show you\nan example of that here.\n\n824\n00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,630\nI'm going to bring up my Windows 7\nmachine again and what I've got is,\n\n825\n00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,030\nwell actually,\ncan we make this go full screen?\n\n826\n00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,930\nMy head's covering up\nthe part I want to show off.\n\n827\n00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,420\nSo [LAUGH] here we go.\n\n828\n00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,314\nIn Windows 7 you have this\nlittle system tray down here and\n\n829\n00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:02,811\nthere's this little flag which is\nkind of your alert center [CROSSTALK]\n\n830\n00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:03,560\n>> Action center.\n\n831\n00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,900\n>> Action center, that's it.\n\n832\n00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,550\nSo it tells you when you've done something\nbad and you need to take action on it and\n\n833\n00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,450\nit will alert you for all sorts of things.\n\n834\n00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,450\nSo for example, let's say I got a wild\nhair and I turned my firewall off right?\n\n835\n00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,740\nSo I'm gonna go and turn my firewall off.\n\n836\n00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:23,020\nAnd when I turn it off, the system is\ngonna recognize that that's a bad idea and\n\n837\n00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,070\nI'm gonna get a little pop-up\nthat warns me about it, and\n\n838\n00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,440\nit actually kinda happened\na little too fast down there.\n\n839\n00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,220\nThe pop-up came up and\nnow it's gone but, but\n\n840\n00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,060\nif I look here I've got\nthree warning messages.\n\n841\n00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,240\nOne of them is,\nturn on your Windows Firewall.\n\n842\n00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,810\nQuit being a dummy, right?\n\n843\n00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,310\nAnd, and that's the important\npart there is it's telling me,\n\n844\n00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,670\nI get software alerts letting me know\nabout this problem, I could ignore it.\n\n845\n00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,210\nI could just whatever, stupid flag and,\nand just ignore it, right?\n\n846\n00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,740\nBut I'm just a click away\nfrom solving this problem.\n\n847\n00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,152\nIf I click on that turn on firewall\noption it gave me, my problems fixed and\n\n848\n00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:56,696\nmy firewall's back on and\nnow that message goes away.\n\n849\n00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:57,950\nAnd I got two others here.\n\n850\n00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,590\nI haven't set up my backups yet so I\nreally don't care about this machine, and\n\n851\n00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,410\nI don't have an anti-virus installed.\n\n852\n00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,280\nAnd so it's offering to help\nme find an anti-virus program.\n\n853\n00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,860\nAnd if you click on it, it will\ntake you to a website where you can\n\n854\n00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,222\npick from the various\nvendors that they deal with.\n\n855\n00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:13,570\nSo you can go in and try and find that.\n\n856\n00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,440\nAnd Microsoft even has some\nfree options that you can get.\n\n857\n00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,380\nBut but here's a list of various\ncompanies that are out there.\n\n858\n00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,770\nYou know, it,\nit's up to you what you want to use.\n\n859\n00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,560\nThe systems are trying to help you.\n\n860\n00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,470\nThey're telling you when you\ndo something blatantly wrong.\n\n861\n00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,210\nNow, they can't watch everything you do,\nso\n\n862\n00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,340\nyou may still be making other mistakes,\nbut at a minimum fix these, right?\n\n863\n00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,500\nThis is important and, and\nthey, they help you out.\n\n864\n00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,760\nYou might also get security software, or\n\n865\n00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,470\nsoftware alerts,\nfrom the vendors themselves.\n\n866\n00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,260\nSo, maybe you bought some software,\nand every now and\n\n867\n00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,030\nthen, you get an email\nupdate from the author.\n\n868\n00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,070\nAnd they say, hey,\nthere was en exploit in this software, so\n\n869\n00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,080\nyou need to update to this version, right?\n\n870\n00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,450\nWe used to, it was a long time ago,\n\n871\n00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,550\nwe had a little, bulletin board that was\nrun through vBulletin, was the software.\n\n872\n00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,250\nAnd we get an email about every four,\nfive weeks, or\n\n873\n00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,130\nwhatever, that's some new\nexploit would be detected.\n\n874\n00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,960\nAnd they'd push an update.\n\n875\n00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,680\nSo they'd email us to let us know\nabout the updating, go and apply it.\n\n876\n00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960\nAnd so we, we'd do that.\n\n877\n00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,650\nIt was really consistent,\nif you didn't do it,\n\n878\n00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,535\nit only took a few days\nbefore the site was, defaced.\n\n879\n00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,530\n[LAUGH] So, cause the, you know,\npeople start shilling really fast.\n\n880\n00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,890\nBut so you get those alerts.\n\n881\n00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,800\nWhen you're notified about\na problem that's your chance.\n\n882\n00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,810\nThat's your chance to go and fix it\nbefore somebody takes advantage of it.\n\n883\n00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,460\nYou're not the only one that knows\nabout the problem at that point.\n\n884\n00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,810\nThey call that releasing or\ndisseminating the, the exploit.\n\n885\n00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:35,190\nWhen somebody finds a flaw they give\nthe vendor a few days to fix the flaw\n\n886\n00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,780\nbefore they tell the world about it.\n\n887\n00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,400\nCuz otherwise if they tell\nthe wold about it and\n\n888\n00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,180\nthere's no fix attackers can\ntake advantage of it right then.\n\n889\n00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,420\nSo they usually delay\nbefore they report it.\n\n890\n00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,290\nWell unless they're the NSA and\nthen they keep it secret and\n\n891\n00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,750\nthey report all your information.\n\n892\n00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,740\nWithout your knowledge, right.\n\n893\n00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,923\nSo there is always that.\n\n894\n00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,000\n[LAUGH]\n>> The last best practices\n\n895\n00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,530\nis about using the proper accounts when\nwe are using our computer systems.\n\n896\n00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,390\nUsually the way that it used\nto be is I guess, for example,\n\n897\n00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,100\nWindows XP when you logged in, if you're\na regular home user, you logged in and\n\n898\n00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,570\nyou were the administrator\nof that computer.\n\n899\n00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,640\nWhich meant that your account.\n\n900\n00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,690\nHave access to everything on the system.\n\n901\n00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,760\nAnd that also meant that as you were on\nthe computer and a virus got onto your\n\n902\n00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,495\ncomputer, it also ran with the privileges,\nwell, that, that you have.\n\n903\n00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n904\n00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,370\n>> So, one of the best\npractices that we have today\n\n905\n00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,100\nis to not actually stay logged in.\n\n906\n00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,380\nAs the computer administrator.\n\n907\n00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,400\n>> Yeah, you know, there's,\n\n908\n00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,250\nthere's three tiers of user\naccount they'll have on a system.\n\n909\n00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,390\nThere's an administrator.\n\n910\n00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,260\nWho can do anything they\nwant on the computer.\n\n911\n00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,610\nThen there's the regular user\nwho is a little more limited.\n\n912\n00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,060\nThey can use the computer.\n\n913\n00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,690\nBut they can't make significant\nchanged to the system.\n\n914\n00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,120\nAnd then the third type of\naccount is a guest account.\n\n915\n00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,610\nAnd that's a person who Is very limited\nbecause they don't normally log in.\n\n916\n00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,640\nIt's like a shared guest, you know,\nthey have no user name and password.\n\n917\n00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,590\nThey just log in, maybe they can\nfire up a web browser or something,\n\n918\n00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,880\nand use some basic\nfunctions on the system.\n\n919\n00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,450\nNow, most systems disable\nthe guest account,\n\n920\n00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,120\nany Linux distribution,\nin Microsoft Windows, they're disabled.\n\n921\n00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600\nIn Mac OS they are turned on though,\n\n922\n00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,830\nthe guest account, so\nyou may need to disable that if you want,\n\n923\n00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,430\nif you don't want that access, like on\nmy laptop I disabled the guest account.\n\n924\n00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,910\nBut as far as administrator versus user,\nwell, let's say it's your personal\n\n925\n00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,090\ncomputer at home, that you're the only one\nwho uses it, so you say, you know what?\n\n926\n00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,530\nI am just going to make\nmyself an administrator and\n\n927\n00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,580\nI'll use that account all the time.\n\n928\n00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,750\nWell, if you browse to a webpage that\nhas a drive by installer from malware.\n\n929\n00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,900\nThe malware's gonna run\nunder your account.\n\n930\n00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,040\nYour account is an administrator account.\n\n931\n00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,800\nSo now the malware has full access to the\nsystem and can change whatever it wants,\n\n932\n00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,640\nversus if you're logged in with a regular\nuser account, not an administrator,\n\n933\n00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,610\njust a regular user, when you go to\nthat drive by malware installation\n\n934\n00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,010\nit'll run under your account but\nyou're not an administrator.\n\n935\n00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,750\nAnd so it's not going to have\nfull access to the system,\n\n936\n00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,250\nit's going to be very limited and so you\nare somewhat protected by that and most\n\n937\n00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,480\nvendors have a very simple recommendation,\nthey say have an administrator account,\n\n938\n00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,300\nyou need one, but don't log in as it,\ninstead, log in as a regular user and\n\n939\n00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,190\nonly when you need to do something\nthat an administrator can only do.\n\n940\n00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,960\nThat's when you log in\nas the Administrator and\n\n941\n00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,950\nyou make those changes then you log out\nand you log back in as your regular user.\n\n942\n00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,550\nSo throughout your normal day you're\njust logged in as a regular user.\n\n943\n00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,860\nSome systems like most Linux distributions\nwill force this really hard.\n\n944\n00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,420\nThey won't let you log in via the network\nusing that root account, that,\n\n945\n00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,830\nthat main administrator account.\n\n946\n00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,430\nOr they won't let you run\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n947\n00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,900\nthey'll force you to the command line.\n\n948\n00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,990\nWith that main account, alright?\n\n949\n00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,140\nBut you log in with your regular user,\nyou can get to the GUI,\n\n950\n00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,980\nyou can access it via network,\nyou can do all that stuff.\n\n951\n00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,300\nThey're forcing you, because they're\nstopping the hackers from being able to\n\n952\n00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,090\nuse that same functionality, right?\n\n953\n00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,390\nAnd that's whats really important\nis we need to make sure we don't\n\n954\n00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,000\ngift the attackers.\n\n955\n00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,830\nYou know, give them this extra access\nwithout them having to work for it.\n\n956\n00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,370\nRight?\n\n957\n00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,190\nSo log in with a regular user account and\nonly log in as an administrator\n\n958\n00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,950\nwhen you're actually doing\nsomething that requires that.\n\n959\n00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,020\nLike installing new software or\napply updates or something like that.\n\n960\n00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:10,500\nAlright so, those are most of the, the\n>> Best practices.\n\n961\n00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,140\n>> Best practices and, you know, David he,\n\n962\n00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,380\nhe's been throwing up\nsome tips on Chrome OS.\n\n963\n00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,170\nAnd I, I know we really\nhaven't addressed that one.\n\n964\n00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,820\nBut but he was saying how Chrome OS has\nguest browsing turned on by default.\n\n965\n00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,820\nSo, you can log into that\nChromebook without logging in.\n\n966\n00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,470\nBut you can't install extensions.\n\n967\n00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,420\nAnd that's really important.\n\n968\n00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,380\nCause there's extensions that\ncan do all sorts of things, but\n\n969\n00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,220\nthey can always use the device.\n\n970\n00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,620\nAnd for something that's shared you know,\nstudents use it, that's ideal.\n\n971\n00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,080\nIn your situation it may not and so\n\n972\n00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,580\nyou can just turn that functionality\noff if you're not going to use it.\n\n973\n00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,430\nAll part of hardening the system.\n\n974\n00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,030\nAlright well that wraps up\nour security best practices.\n\n975\n00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:49,070\nWe're not quite done with security though,\nwe've got one more section talking about\n\n976\n00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,080\nweb browser best practices, and that is\nreally the gateway that most people have\n\n977\n00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,940\nto getting their systems infected so\nwe do need to spend some time on that.\n\n978\n00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,010\nBut for this episode this is a pretty good\nspot to wrap it up so let's stop here.\n\n979\n00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,590\nLet me remind you if you have questions\non any of this please feel free to ask.\n\n980\n00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,960\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n981\n00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,260\nAnd, you'll see the chat box\nright beneath the

evening and\n\n4\n00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,253\nwelcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:42,830\nback in with Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nhow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,760\n>> It is going swell,\nI still have not caused any other\n\n7\n00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,230\nmajor disruption in the United States\npostal system by hacking into it.\n\n8\n00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,870\n>> But,\nyou didn't mention any other countries.\n\n9\n00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,870\n>> That's true.\n[LAUGH] I did not.\n\n10\n00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,370\n>> [LAUGH] You've been a busy man.\n\n11\n00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,820\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, well speaking of security,\n\n12\n00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,030\nwe've got our final security\nepisode coming up here,\n\n13\n00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,850\nas we jump into objective 3.3, which is,\nlet's see, the official title here.\n\n14\n00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,840\nGiven a scenario,\nuse web browsing best practices.\n\n15\n00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,725\nUnfortunately.\n\n16\n00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:13,286\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The web\n\n17\n00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,033\nbrowser is a powerful tool, right?\n\n18\n00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,396\nYou know, it gives people access to tons\nof information they didn't have before.\n\n19\n00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:22,284\nBut it is also the gateway\nto getting viruses, malware,\n\n20\n00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:26,070\nother software type\ninfections on your system.\n\n21\n00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,990\nWhen you take somebody's average computer,\n\n22\n00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,380\nit doesn't reach out to the internet\nvery much, not by itself.\n\n23\n00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,430\nThe operating system might do updates but\nthat's about it.\n\n24\n00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,290\nThat web browser, that's that gateway.\n\n25\n00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,270\nIt reaches out to all these different\nsites as you browse the web.\n\n26\n00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,810\nAnd it accesses thing you don't even know\nin the background, cuz who knows what\n\n27\n00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,810\nimages are embedded in a website, and\nwhat server they're rendered off of.\n\n28\n00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,150\nAnd so, it's like a, I mean, just a tunnel\nthat you build out to the Internet that\n\n29\n00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,580\nlets people, potentially,\nget into your system.\n\n30\n00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,320\nAnd so, it does require some basic\n\n31\n00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,600\nbest practices to stop yourself from\ngetting you know, a damaged system.\n\n32\n00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,280\n>> Yeah, this, this is the software that\nreally is us saying, I will connect to\n\n33\n00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,090\nany computer out there, and ask it for\nmaterial to come back to me.\n\n34\n00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,100\nSo, if we want to know where\nwe're gonna end up getting\n\n35\n00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,790\na lot of the malware that gets onto our\ncomputer where we're gonna get attacks,\n\n36\n00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,860\nis when our system is reaching out saying.\n\n37\n00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,720\nPlease let me download your stuff and\n\n38\n00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,600\nit may not be able to check\nthe way that it needs to do.\n\n39\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,110\nSo we want to make sure that we understand\nwhat it is that we're gonna actually need\n\n40\n00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,990\nto do to help secure ourselves\na little bit better.\n\n41\n00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,140\n>> All right, so\nwhat are some of those things, right?\n\n42\n00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,590\nWell, we start off right\nhere with just re,\n\n43\n00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,010\nrecognize a secure connection or website.\n\n44\n00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,350\nIf you're going to a website, and you're\ngonna be providing sensitive information.\n\n45\n00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,640\nAnd that might be credit card number,\nthat's probably the most common.\n\n46\n00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,980\nBut it could be your medical data.\n\n47\n00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,960\nYou could be filing online taxes, so\nit might be your social security number.\n\n48\n00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,620\nWhatever it is like that,\nif it is sensitive data,\n\n49\n00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,200\nby no means should you send that\nacross the internet unencrypted.\n\n50\n00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,790\nIf someone can intercept that traffic,\nthey'll have your information.\n\n51\n00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,520\nAnd that's a terrible, terrible thing.\n\n52\n00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,490\nSo, we need to insure we\nhave a secure connection.\n\n53\n00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,305\nAnd fortunately, that's pretty easy to do.\n\n54\n00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:13,945\nRonnie, did you want to show it or\ndo you want to do it on mine?\n\n55\n00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,205\n>> Either way.\n\n56\n00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:22,415\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthe the secured web browser web browsing.\n\n57\n00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:27,265\nI just went ahead typed in google.com,\nwww google.com, and\n\n58\n00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,265\nright away,\nI see over here on the left-hand side,\n\n59\n00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:35,075\nI get it were it shows me this\ngreen little lock as well as https.\n\n60\n00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:38,720\nThat shows me that I'm in\na secured browsing session.\n\n61\n00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,160\nSo, here's a key identifier for us, right?\n\n62\n00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,150\nRight now, Don was mentioning\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n63\n00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,940\nDon I'm not really entering\nanything in here, but\n\n64\n00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,160\nGoogle has decided to go ahead and\nadd in security for me.\n\n65\n00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,920\nAnd this lock tells me that it is secured.\n\n66\n00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,330\nIf I go ahead and click on it, I can see\nwhere it gives me an identity verified.\n\n67\n00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,418\nAnd, I can also end up seeing the the\ncertificate's somewhere on this site.\n\n68\n00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:05,581\n>> If you click on the Connection tab,\nsee, you're on the Permissions tab there,\n\n69\n00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,037\nif you click on the Connections tab.\n\n70\n00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,251\n>> And then, right in there,\nyou hit Certificate Information and\n\n71\n00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,932\nit'll show you the cert,\nI mean, right there,\n\n72\n00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,854\nyou see the encryption that you used, but\nright here, you see the actual cert data.\n\n73\n00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,593\n>> So here's what a valid\ncertificate looks like.\n\n74\n00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:19,879\nWe can see where it gives us where,\nwho it's issued to.\n\n75\n00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,650\nAs well as the validity\ndates that we have.\n\n76\n00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,950\nAnd this is from 10/22/14 all the way\nthrough the, January 19th of 2015.\n\n77\n00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,260\nSo this particular certificates\ngonna last us about three months\n\n78\n00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,350\nis what we're actually seeing.\n\n79\n00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,290\nAnd so\nit's gonna be valid from that point, and\n\n80\n00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,030\nas long as this certificate\nis actually valid,\n\n81\n00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,620\nI know that I'm connected to Google, and\nnot to someone that claims to be Google.\n\n82\n00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,740\n>> Yeah, I know you might ask yourself,\n\n83\n00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,700\nwhy would they do a certificate just for\nthree months?\n\n84\n00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,060\nThat's crazy, right?\n\n85\n00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,170\nWell the thing about a certificate is\nthey're encrypting your data with it.\n\n86\n00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,170\nAnd, if the certificate\nwere to get compromised,\n\n87\n00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,278\nsomebody could decrypt your data.\n\n88\n00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,451\nBut even if the certificate doesn't\nget compromised, somebody could gather\n\n89\n00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,492\nyour encrypted data, and then start\nworking on it, trying to decrypt it.\n\n90\n00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,781\nAnd if they could figure out what\nthat private key is to decrypt it,\n\n91\n00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,780\nthen they could go and start grabbing\nreal, you know, current data.\n\n92\n00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,780\nBut by changing every three months,\nthe hackers have to start all over again.\n\n93\n00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,860\nAnd right now, it is not possible to break\na, a encrypted internet communication\n\n94\n00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,550\nIn three months, right, and computers\njust aren't able to handle that yet.\n\n95\n00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,760\nIn time, they might and so you might see\nGoogle step down to an even shorter time.\n\n96\n00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,340\nSo don't, don't necessarily\nexpect to see a long lifetime.\n\n97\n00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,880\nThe longer a certificate is valid for,\n\n98\n00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,050\nthe weaker it is because it increases\nthe chance of people doing attacks.\n\n99\n00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,740\nNow, the unfortunate part is when\nweb web masters or whatever.\n\n100\n00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,220\nWhen they go to buy a certificate,\nwhat do all the certificate vendors do?\n\n101\n00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,970\nThey say hey.\n\n102\n00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,280\nBuy two years and save some money.\n\n103\n00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840\nBuy three years and save even more.\n\n104\n00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,560\nThey're encouraging you to buy these long\ncertificates which are bad for security.\n\n105\n00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,690\nSo, if you see a site with a two year or\na three year SSL cert.\n\n106\n00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,890\nThey saved some money.\n\n107\n00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,100\nGreat.\nGood for them.\n\n108\n00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,420\nBut, it's not necessarily\nthe greatest thing.\n\n109\n00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,440\nMany sites will take something lower.\n\n110\n00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,900\nFor our site, we do just one year.\n\n111\n00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,580\nSo, every year, we do a new certificate.\n\n112\n00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,710\nNow, I like what you mentioned Ronnie,\nthat when you went to the site,\n\n113\n00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,466\nyou weren't doing anything secure but\nit secured the page, right?\n\n114\n00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:15,560\nGo to amazon.com instead.\n\n115\n00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,710\nSo, on, on Ronnie's computer,\n\n116\n00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,515\nhe's gonna pull up the amazon.com\nwebsite and when he goes to it,\n\n117\n00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:25,250\nit's, you know, it's an e-commerce site,\nand notice that it's not secure.\n\n118\n00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,000\nThere's no green lock up there and\nit doesn't say https, just not secure.\n\n119\n00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,730\nAnd if we start searching for\nthings, so maybe you want to get\n\n120\n00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,230\nSteel Magnolias on DVD, I know\nthat's one of your favorites Ronnie.\n\n121\n00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,070\n>> I love them.\n\n122\n00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,173\n>> And so-\n>> What are they?\n\n123\n00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,489\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's, like, a Dolly Parton movie,\n\n124\n00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,916\nit's absolutely terrible, but,\nbut it worked for my example.\n\n125\n00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,826\nSo, [CROSSTALK] hey look at this,\nit's on sale for five bucks Ronny.\n\n126\n00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,475\n>> [CROSSTALK] Get two of them.\n\n127\n00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,810\n>> His whole communication right\nnow is not secured, right?\n\n128\n00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,180\nSo, no SSL or whatever.\n\n129\n00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,610\nNow, if he goes to buy this movie,\nso if he adds it to his cart and\n\n130\n00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,330\nthen goes to check out, or if up top,\nhe goes to log in, it's gonna switch.\n\n131\n00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,709\nSo Ronnie, hit that Proceed to Checkout.\n\n132\n00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,010\nWhen he proceeds to check out, now it's\nasking for him to authenticate, right?\n\n133\n00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,540\nSo, it's got that https up there,\nthat green lock up here.\n\n134\n00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,270\nNow it's secure.\n\n135\n00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,812\nWhy is it secure now?\n\n136\n00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:22,690\nCuz he's about to put in a user name and\npassword.\n\n137\n00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,800\nRight?\nHe's about to do authentication.\n\n138\n00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,810\nThat's important.\n\n139\n00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,350\nSo, when you're on a website,\n\n140\n00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,060\nif you're about to buy something, if you\nare about to put in your, your birthday,\n\n141\n00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,940\neven simple information,\nyou should look for that security symbol.\n\n142\n00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,000\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nGoogle chose to encrypt their whole site.\n\n143\n00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,470\nWhy isn't Amazon?\n\n144\n00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,230\nWell, there is a push right now from some\nof the security professionals out there to\n\n145\n00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,400\nuse SSL all the time.\n\n146\n00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,283\nAnd those professionals are almost always,\nI don't want to say misinformed, but\n\n147\n00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,966\ndo a little bit of overkill.\n\n148\n00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,396\nWhen you encrypt a communication,\n\n149\n00:07:56,396 --> 00:08:00,608\nit creates a processor burden\non the client and on the server.\n\n150\n00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,347\nSo, the more encryption you do,\n\n151\n00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:06,387\nthe less users your server can handle\nThe less users your servers can handle,\n\n152\n00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:09,570\nthe more servers you need\nwhich increases your cost.\n\n153\n00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,530\nSo if you're encrypting data\nthat doesn't need to be secured,\n\n154\n00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,770\nyou're really wasting resources.\n\n155\n00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,330\nAnd, it's bad for a number of things.\n\n156\n00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,050\nIt's bad for a company's bottom line but\nit's also bad for\n\n157\n00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,710\nthe environment because you're\nconsuming more electricity.\n\n158\n00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,870\nThere's all sorts of negatives to it.\n\n159\n00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,310\nSo what many sites will do,\nwhat you saw Amazon do,\n\n160\n00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,330\nis they won't encrypt data that\ndoesn't need to be encrypted.\n\n161\n00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,290\nAnd it's only when you move into those\nareas where you do something that\n\n162\n00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,650\nneeds security that it kicks in.\n\n163\n00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,930\nAnd we do the same thing on, on our site.\n\n164\n00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,100\nWhen you're on ITProTV and\nyou're watching one of our videos,\n\n165\n00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,180\nyou don't want the whole video\nto be encrypted and sent to you.\n\n166\n00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,110\nThat's a lot of data.\n\n167\n00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,510\nOne of our videos could\nbe a gigabyte of data.\n\n168\n00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,520\nAnd have to encrypt and\ndecrypt data, that, that's a lot.\n\n169\n00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,560\nIt creates a processor burden.\n\n170\n00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,590\nSo, we don't bother encrypting that cuz\nit's, it doesn't need to be secured.\n\n171\n00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,190\nSomebody intercepts that video,\nwell, good for them,\n\n172\n00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,110\nthey know how to intercept traffic.\n\n173\n00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,070\nBut, when you go to your account page,\nwhen you go to check out,\n\n174\n00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,460\nwhen you go to do things like that,\nit flips over to the secure page.\n\n175\n00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,240\nSo the sensitive pages are protected,\nthe non-sensitive ones aren't.\n\n176\n00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,110\nAnd that's a very common practice\nyou'll see a lot of sites do that.\n\n177\n00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,730\nBut you need to be aware to look for it.\n\n178\n00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,670\nTo say, hey, I'm about to put in\npersonally identifiable information,\n\n179\n00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,810\nPII is this page secure?\n\n180\n00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,000\nAnd if it's not secure,\ndon't do it, don't, don't log in.\n\n181\n00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,560\nYou know, that's,\nthat's what you should do.\n\n182\n00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,550\nAlright, so so\n\n183\n00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,790\nmany other things that we need to be\naware of, invalid certificate warnings.\n\n184\n00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,920\nRonnie showed us examples of certificates\nthat were valid, that worked.\n\n185\n00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,350\nBut what happens if\nthe certificate is not valid?\n\n186\n00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,940\nYour browser will kick a warning and,\nRonnie you got an example of that?\n\n187\n00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,080\n>> I do.\n>> Yup.\n\n188\n00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,860\n>> I went a did a screenshot of one\nparticular certificate that tells us that,\n\n189\n00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,160\nhere it is,\ni tried to connect into this server and\n\n190\n00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,750\nit says name of this certificate\nis from this remote computer,\n\n191\n00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,550\nit says the following errors were\nencountered while validating the remote\n\n192\n00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,100\ncomputer certificate the certificate is\nnot from a trusted certifying authority.\n\n193\n00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,900\nSo here's an example of where you may come\nacross a, a server that you connect to out\n\n194\n00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,340\nthere, but it's not actually able to\nvalidate that this certificate's actually\n\n195\n00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,524\ngonna be from validated from\n[INAUDIBLE] that certifying authority,\n\n196\n00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:19,580\nbut when we see this, normally the link\ninstead of turning green in HTTPS,\n\n197\n00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,680\nit normally turns red, and\nsometimes even x's it out.\n\n198\n00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,460\n>> There's three things that can\ncause a certificate to fail.\n\n199\n00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,030\nAlright?\n\n200\n00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,710\nThe first one is, it can be expired.\n\n201\n00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,060\nIt has a date that it's valid for.\n\n202\n00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,630\nIf it's after that date,\nthe certificate is no longer valid.\n\n203\n00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,270\nIt's gonna fail.\nAlright?\n\n204\n00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,710\nThe second thing is,\nthe name it was issued to.\n\n205\n00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,440\nThe one that Ronnie showed\nus a minute ago for Google.\n\n206\n00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,610\nIt said it was issued to www.google.com.\n\n207\n00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,810\nIf you're on some other site,\nthat certificate's going to fail.\n\n208\n00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,600\nThat is not who they say they are.\n\n209\n00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,310\nAlright?\n\n210\n00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,020\nAnd the third thing is, who issued it?\n\n211\n00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,970\nThere are a handful of trusted root\nauthorities that are issuing these\n\n212\n00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,140\ncertificates, and\nthose are the ones we trust automatically.\n\n213\n00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,095\nIf somebody else issued\nit like well like me.\n\n214\n00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:03,935\nI issue what are called,\n\n215\n00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:07,285\nself signed certificates all the time,\nwhere i just make them myself.\n\n216\n00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:09,255\nWell do you guys trust me?\n\n217\n00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:12,305\nWell you might see me on the show, but\nyou've never, never come to my house and\n\n218\n00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,035\nhad dinner or anything.\n\n219\n00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,200\nThere's no reason you\nshould trust me right?\n\n220\n00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,520\nSo, if you get a certificate on a website\nand it shows it's being issued by,\n\n221\n00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,700\nyou know, DonCo, or whatever,\nyour system's not gonna trust that and\n\n222\n00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,160\nit's gonna throw up that red flag.\n\n223\n00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,990\nSo, those are the three things that it\nchecks whenever you access the site\n\n224\n00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,370\nthat uses SSL, right.\n\n225\n00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,250\nYou know, one other quick thing\njust to mention in real-life land.\n\n226\n00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,720\nWe don't technically use SSL anymore.\n\n227\n00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,850\nIt, that's what we always refer to it as,\nas secure socket layer.\n\n228\n00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,960\nBut secure socket layer was kind of\nreplaced by TLS, transport layer security.\n\n229\n00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,210\nSo there was SSL version 1,\nversion 2, version 3.\n\n230\n00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,749\nAnd then it went to TLS 1.0,\nTLS 1.1, 1.2, and now 1.3.\n\n231\n00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:55,110\nSo most people are using\nTLS 1.2 right now.\n\n232\n00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,440\nBut we still say SSL,\n\n233\n00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,220\ncuz it's using the same certificates\nimplemented the same way.\n\n234\n00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,170\nIt's using different encryption, so\nit's much stronger now that it used to be.\n\n235\n00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,750\nSo if you ever hear somebody\ntalking about TLS, well,\n\n236\n00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,260\nthat's just the newer replacement for SSL.\n\n237\n00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,930\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,940\nOur, our next one is\nsuspicious links in banners.\n\n239\n00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,864\nAnd we had kind of a funny\nlittle event before this show.\n\n240\n00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:17,801\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:18,838\nRonnie said hey,\n\n242\n00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:23,550\ndo we have some suspicious banner ads to\nshow [LAUGH] during the, during the show?\n\n243\n00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,964\nAnd i said no [LAUGH] because,\ncuz most of them deal with porn.\n\n244\n00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:28,648\n>> Yeah.\n\n245\n00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,248\n>> And i didn't want to bring that\nup in the show [LAUGH] and so,\n\n246\n00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:34,963\nso i was like we'll just tell people about\nit, but for one of the other examples\n\n247\n00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,043\nwe're gonna see a little bit later\ni had to download some software and\n\n248\n00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:41,680\nthe website was a great example of\nsuspicious banner adds and links.\n\n249\n00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,830\nI wanted to download a program\ncalled HijackThis i,\n\n250\n00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,110\nI'm gonna show you this program\na little bit later in, in this episode.\n\n251\n00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,010\nAnd when i went to download it.\n\n252\n00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,750\nHijackThis is owned by\na company called Trend Micro.\n\n253\n00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,580\nTrend Micro is one of the leading\nantivirus companies in the world.\n\n254\n00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,220\nI know the company.\n\n255\n00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,180\nThey've been around a long time.\n\n256\n00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,620\nI trust Trend Micro.\n\n257\n00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,610\nAlright?\n\n258\n00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,180\nSo i went to their website and\nadd this for a utility.\n\n259\n00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,480\nAnd i, I've used utility a thousand times,\nso i, i trust this utility.\n\n260\n00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,720\nSo, so far i,\nI'm in my warm fuzzy trust zone, right?\n\n261\n00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,990\nIt's a free utility though,\nso to offset the bandwidth,\n\n262\n00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,170\nTrend Micro has allowed another\ncompany to host the download file.\n\n263\n00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,880\nSo when i click on the download link, it\ntook me to the Cnet website, download.com.\n\n264\n00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,080\nIt's powered by Cnet, right there.\n\n265\n00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,310\nNow, i used to trust CNet.\n\n266\n00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,260\n>> Long time ago.\n\n267\n00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,820\n>> Yeah, long time ago.\n\n268\n00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,990\nLike eight or 10 years ago, right.\n\n269\n00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,570\nBut CNet is not the company\nthey used to be.\n\n270\n00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,410\nAnd now i specifically do not trust them.\n\n271\n00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,990\nSo whenever i go to their website,\nI'm always on, on the alert.\n\n272\n00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,050\nSo i wanted this file but\n\n273\n00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,380\nhere I'm downloading it from\na site that i don't trust.\n\n274\n00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,420\nSo when i go there they know that\nI wanna download HijackThis and\n\n275\n00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,570\nit says in big letters right here,\n\n276\n00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,840\ntrend micro HijackThis, but if you scan\nacross this [LAUGH] webpage real quick.\n\n277\n00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,590\nWhere's the download link?\n\n278\n00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,760\nRight?\n>> Way different downloads.\n\n279\n00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,980\n>> There's this big one here.\n\n280\n00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,120\nAnd there's this big one here, these\nstand out, these giant green buttons.\n\n281\n00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920\nBut, what's not so obvious is that\nthis one up here is a banner add.\n\n282\n00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,440\nAlright.\n\n283\n00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,330\nIt's a banner ad but\n\n284\n00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,870\nit's kind of hard to see that light\ngray line on a white background.\n\n285\n00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,470\nThat's the banner ad.\n\n286\n00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,030\nAnd it says free download.\n\n287\n00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,060\nWell hijack this is free that must be it.\n\n288\n00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,770\nBut if you read it says click free\ndownload, run the quick scan,\n\n289\n00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,310\nfix the errors.\n\n290\n00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,760\nTuneup Pro.\n\n291\n00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,686\nI, i don't know what\nthe hell Tuneup Pro is.\n\n292\n00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,300\n[LAUGH] i, i have never heard of that.\n\n293\n00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,670\nThis is not for Mi, HijackThis.\n\n294\n00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,600\nIt, they put it in little tiny\nletters right here in the corner.\n\n295\n00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,470\nThe whole rest of this makes\nit sound like HijackThis.\n\n296\n00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,030\nHijackThis can run a scan.\n\n297\n00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,100\nIt can fix errors.\n\n298\n00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,800\nIt, it does that.\n\n299\n00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,810\nBut that's not what this is for.\n\n300\n00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,700\nThat, is a, a misleading banner ad.\n\n301\n00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,400\nIf i click that it's gonna take me\nto download some software which is\n\n302\n00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,360\nnot what i wanted.\n\n303\n00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,550\nAnd, if I install that software,\n\n304\n00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,150\nit could have all sorts of other things\npackaged in it and i end up in trouble.\n\n305\n00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,470\nNow, that's a banner ad right there.\n\n306\n00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,270\nHere is one of those square ones, not\na banner so this is more like a link box.\n\n307\n00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,610\nIt just happens to be the same ad.\n\n308\n00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,020\nThe point is,\ni went to a download page and\n\n309\n00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,670\nthe nice big download buttons are not for\nthe product that i wanted.\n\n310\n00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,650\nThis one here,\nthis just green text on a gray background.\n\n311\n00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,890\nNot even a button, right.\n\n312\n00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,800\nThat's the actual download button.\n\n313\n00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,870\nAnd so if i click that,\n\n314\n00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,550\nthat's what's gonna take me to\ndownload the HijackThis software.\n\n315\n00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,450\nSo, an end user who's\nnot paying attention,\n\n316\n00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,400\nwho's skimming across the page\nreal quick might not notice that.\n\n317\n00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,420\nAnd there's other misleading ones on here,\nthis is why i don't like CNET.\n\n318\n00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,100\nIf you look at the other advertisements,\nlike right here, support for\n\n319\n00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,151\nTrend Micro call this number, alright.\n\n320\n00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:38,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n321\n00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,710\nif i have a problem with Trend Micro,\nthere's the number i need to call.\n\n322\n00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,360\nWell, except, look at the url.\n\n323\n00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,180\nGurua.com/trendmicro, that's not\nTrendMicro, that's some third party,\n\n324\n00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,800\nsome other company, and if i call\nthat number, that's not who i want.\n\n325\n00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,306\nBut, it's got a 5 star rating,\nfrom who knows what,\n\n326\n00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,118\ni don't even know who did that rating.\n\n327\n00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:03,438\nSo these are things that\nare misleading advertisements.\n\n328\n00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:07,757\nAt their best, they take you to a site to\ntry and sell you something you don't want.\n\n329\n00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:11,851\nAll right, at their worst it does\nthe single click install of malware and\n\n330\n00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,810\nall of sudden your machines is infected.\n\n331\n00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,450\nClick a link thinking you're getting\nwhat you want, and it's not right so\n\n332\n00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,535\nthat's a real problem that we have.\n\n333\n00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:26,155\nAnd you just have to train your end users,\nand yourself, to not just click right\n\n334\n00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:30,345\naway, to take a moment and read the stuff\nthat's sitting around that button.\n\n335\n00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:33,597\nWhat is around that button that\nexplains what it really does and\n\n336\n00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:36,632\nyou'll be able to pick up on the fact\nthat, that's just not right.\n\n337\n00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:40,737\nOkay so those suspicious links you\ngotta be careful with that, and\n\n338\n00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:46,460\nany link where it shows an address\nlike this one where it says gurua.com.\n\n339\n00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,960\nAnd I float my mouse over it, and,\noh this little pop up, doesn't show up.\n\n340\n00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,010\nShoot.\n\n341\n00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,060\nWhen I float my mouse over that on,\non my screen, you guys can't see a little\n\n342\n00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,330\npop up bar, but there's a little message\ntelling me what the actual url is, and\n\n343\n00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,730\nit actually points to a different server,\nit's not pointing to guruaid.com,\n\n344\n00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,140\nit's pointing somewhere else, so\nI really don't know what that is, and\n\n345\n00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,910\nthat's definitely not something that\nI would want to click on right.\n\n346\n00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,030\nThose are some of the signs\nof a suspicious link.\n\n347\n00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,660\nAll right, what else do we have,\noh, recognized adware symptoms.\n\n348\n00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,190\nSo let's say I were to click on that\ndownload link and install that software.\n\n349\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,480\nIt's almost guaranteed to be adware.\n\n350\n00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,070\nTo have advertisements built into it that\nare gonna pop up on my system whether I\n\n351\n00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,450\nlike it or not.\n\n352\n00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,000\nI could reboot my computer and when I log\nin I immediately see an advertisement.\n\n353\n00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,620\nWhen I'm browsing the web I'm going to\nsites that I know don't normally have ads\n\n354\n00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,460\nand I get pop-ups.\n\n355\n00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,500\nI get other types of advertisements.\n\n356\n00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,800\nThose are the things\nthat adware tries to do.\n\n357\n00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,340\nSo how do we recognize that?\n\n358\n00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,130\nWhat do we look for?\n\n359\n00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,760\n>> Yeah.\n\n360\n00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,660\nThere's a couple of different symptoms\nwhen you do get adware on your\n\n361\n00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,350\ncomputer and what, when this happens.\n\n362\n00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,510\nOne of them is that all of a sudden when\nyou and you launch up a new browser and\n\n363\n00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,250\nit tells you that your\nhomepage is something else.\n\n364\n00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,230\nSo you may get we call\na homepage redirection.\n\n365\n00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,440\nOr you go and, and do a default search and\n\n366\n00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,700\nit takes you to some other search engine\nthat you wouldn't normally end up using.\n\n367\n00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,830\nSo it can change the way that you've\nactually got your browser configured,\n\n368\n00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,540\nto do the basic function\nnow that you normally would\n\n369\n00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,280\nnormally do on your browser.\n\n370\n00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,020\n>> Yeah that homepage\nredirection is a great one.\n\n371\n00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,870\nEven easier spot.\n\n372\n00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,210\nIf you change your homepage back and\nthen it puts it back, right?\n\n373\n00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,620\nThat's a great way to recognize\nyou've got adware installed.\n\n374\n00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,080\nSo not being able to\nchange your home page.\n\n375\n00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,790\nThe redirected search, I see that\na lot where you go to Google and\n\n376\n00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,190\ninstead it takes you to Ask.com.\n\n377\n00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,920\nOther things the presence of a tool bar,\nright?\n\n378\n00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,480\nThere was a brief period of time.\n\n379\n00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,780\nFrom, what would you say,\naround like 2001 to 2002 maybe?\n\n380\n00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,770\nWhere toolbars were all the rage.\n\n381\n00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,890\nThere was the Google desktop.\n\n382\n00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,570\nYou could get that toolbar in internet\nexplorer that would let you search your\n\n383\n00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,860\nwhole desktop.\n\n384\n00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,490\nThere were other toolbars from various\ncompanies that people thought were neat,\n\n385\n00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,440\nbut it just got overrun with junk toolbars\nthat all slowed down your browser.\n\n386\n00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,410\nAnd so today,\n\n387\n00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,405\nI can't think of a single legitimate\nweb browser toolbar that's available.\n\n388\n00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And and let me,\n\n389\n00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,130\nlet me show you what about.\n\n390\n00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,070\nIf you've never seen one of these,\n\n391\n00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,800\nlet me see if I can just do a quick\nlike a Google Images search.\n\n392\n00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400\nOh, no.\n\n393\n00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,350\nI got a Bing search.\n\n394\n00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,310\nLet me,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n395\n00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,800\n>> Sorry, that, that's not gonna do.\n\n396\n00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,243\nLet me go to Google cuz I, I actually\nwanna find what I'm looking for.\n\n397\n00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:20,797\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n398\n00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:23,880\nI'll have to jump over\nto go to Google instead.\n\n399\n00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,660\nHere we go.\nSo they're showing something,\n\n400\n00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,420\noh this, this is the-\n>> Yeah.\n\n401\n00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,920\n>> Funny picture-\n>> Yes.\n\n402\n00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,190\n>> I was telling you about earlier Ronnie.\n\n403\n00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,790\nBut here.\nWe'll,\n\n404\n00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,830\nwe'll pull up one of these prank pictures.\n\n405\n00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,800\nWell, boy, it would be nice if that was\nmore than that really low resolution.\n\n406\n00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,250\nOh this is a good one.\n\n407\n00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,969\nSo if we take a look at this one,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,510\n>> This is on Thesba.com,\n\n409\n00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,200\nlet me just give them credit.\n\n410\n00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,180\nSo heres just a snapshot of a whole bunch\nof different toolbars that are available.\n\n411\n00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,660\nYou can go out and get these, and\nyou'll see the Google toolbar,\n\n412\n00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,050\nYahoo!, Ask,\nI dont even know who that one is.\n\n413\n00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,580\nAim at site, never heard of that.\n\n414\n00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,560\nSome of these I haven't even heard of.\n\n415\n00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,070\nBut theres several\ndifferent toolbars here.\n\n416\n00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,210\nNow they operate under the guise\nof making your life easier.\n\n417\n00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,460\nGive you some shortcuts to do some things,\ngive you an instant search.\n\n418\n00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,160\nBut most web browsers these days have\nsearch built into the, the address bar.\n\n419\n00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,390\nAnd have the ability to\ndisplay a favorite's menu so\n\n420\n00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,870\nthis functionality is really\nnot necessary anymore.\n\n421\n00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,350\nSo why still make the toolbar?\n\n422\n00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,640\nWell, if you run them,\nI know Alexa is a great example.\n\n423\n00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,700\nWhat Alexa, does is it monitors\neverything you type into the browser.\n\n424\n00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,630\nWhenever you do a Google search,\nwhenever you browse to Amazon and\n\n425\n00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,550\nyou're looking at products,\nit's monitoring all of that.\n\n426\n00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,480\nAnd then It'll make\nadvertisement based suggestions\n\n427\n00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,060\nbased on what you've been looking for.\n\n428\n00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,730\nAll right?\n\n429\n00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,520\nAnd some of them will even inject\ndata into the webpages you view.\n\n430\n00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,370\nI, I remember seeing one of these\nwhere I went to Google's homepage.\n\n431\n00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,280\nI went to www.google.com and there was\na banner ad on the www.google.com page and\n\n432\n00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,550\nI said to myself what the heck,\nGoogle's doing a banner ad,\n\n433\n00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,590\nwhat, what is that company coming to.\n\n434\n00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,490\nAnd, it wasn't the Google site that was\ndoing it, it was, an extension that\n\n435\n00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,810\nwas installed on the web browser and it\nwas adding that advertisement in, and so\n\n436\n00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,070\nthere are some extensions that will do\nthat and you gotta be careful with it.\n\n437\n00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,070\nSo toolbars were really bad about that.\n\n438\n00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,370\nAnd the old prank video or picture that\nwas sent out, right, is what we're seeing\n\n439\n00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,670\nhere where, somebody took their web\nbrowser and installed so many toolbars\n\n440\n00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,510\nthat you'd launch internet explorer and\nyou could see all these toolbars.\n\n441\n00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,300\nYou knew it was working but\nyou couldn't even see the webpage.\n\n442\n00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,700\nThe webpage was just obscured\nby all the toolbars.\n\n443\n00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,740\nNow that's an extreme case, but\nit it, it can happen I suppose, but\n\n444\n00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,230\nthey're almost always a great\nsign that you've got adware.\n\n445\n00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,460\n>> A lot of times, you go and\ndownload something,\n\n446\n00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,430\nsuch as from Download.com\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n447\n00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,450\n>> And the installer that comes with it,\n\n448\n00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,230\nif you are clicking through it as\nfast as you can without reading them,\n\n449\n00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,660\nsometimes they have a little check mark,\nor actually it tells you to uncheck it.\n\n450\n00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,300\nYou know.\n\n451\n00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> You, you, you have to read slowly.\n\n452\n00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,670\nIt's either you're checking it or you're\nunchecking it, and if you uncheck it\n\n453\n00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,500\nyou're actually installing it, if you\nleave it checked you're actually not\n\n454\n00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,778\ninstalling it, so you do have to slow\ndown and be careful on those things.\n\n455\n00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:07,220\n>> Yeah, you know, there's a great\nexample of that with bit torrent.\n\n456\n00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,170\nOne of the most popular bit torrent\nclients out there is one that's called,\n\n457\n00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,010\nis it mue torrent?\n\n458\n00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,620\nIt's the Roman, Greek,\nwhatever letter for U or something.\n\n459\n00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,000\nAnd, is a very popular one, and\nif you download it, it's free.\n\n460\n00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,790\nAnd during the installer,\nit offers four or\n\n461\n00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,495\nfive different times to install different.\n\n462\n00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,730\nAd-based programs.\n\n463\n00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,110\nAnd if you install it,\nthat's how they make their money.\n\n464\n00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,740\nIf you don't install it then you're fine,\nyou get it for free.\n\n465\n00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,410\nBut you have to read each one to say,\nall right, is this one I unchecked?\n\n466\n00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,260\nDo I say yes to this,\nor do I say no to this?\n\n467\n00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,130\nDo I say I agree, or disagree?\n\n468\n00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,530\nYou gotta read it to figure\nout which one to do.\n\n469\n00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,840\nThey're, they're trying to,\nthey're actively trying to trick you so\n\n470\n00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,700\nthat you'll install the software so\nthey can get some money.\n\n471\n00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,280\nAll right.\n\n472\n00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560\nSo be aware of that,\n\n473\n00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,730\nbe on the look out and\nonly download software from trusted sites.\n\n474\n00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,440\nRight.\nIf it something that you want, if you,\n\n475\n00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,050\nyou need it try and\nget it from a trusted site.\n\n476\n00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,400\nIf you have to deal with a site don't\ntrust, like me with download.com, you just\n\n477\n00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,120\ngot ta take your time and read and, and\nmake sure you're not doing something dumb.\n\n478\n00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,400\nAll right we got a few other\nthings lets talk about PII and\n\n479\n00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000\nthen maybe we'll stop and\ntake a break there.\n\n480\n00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,220\nSo, PII we've already\nmentioned a few times that's\n\n481\n00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,090\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n482\n00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,740\nAll right.\n\n483\n00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,750\nWhat counts as PII?\n\n484\n00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,430\nThere's a lot of things that don't.\n\n485\n00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,130\nYour name is not PII.\n\n486\n00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,880\nThat sounds weird, right?\n\n487\n00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200\nLike, isn't my name,\nisn't that personally identifiable?\n\n488\n00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,160\nWell, my name is Don Pezet.\n\n489\n00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,290\nAnd my last name is,\nis really unique here in the US.\n\n490\n00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,910\nMy, my family, you know,\nback in the tree, is from France.\n\n491\n00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,200\nAnd in France,\nit's actually not an uncommon last name.\n\n492\n00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,100\nAnd so over there, there,\nthere may be another Don.\n\n493\n00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,120\nSo there, there could be more\nthan one Don Pezet in the world.\n\n494\n00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,900\nSo, you wouldn't\nnecessarily know it was me.\n\n495\n00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,980\nIf my name was John Smith, you could, you\ncould guarantee that there's more than one\n\n496\n00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,150\nJohn Smith or Ronnie,\nyour last name is not uncommon.\n\n497\n00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,450\n>> Yeah, I, I think Wong is\nactually fairly unique in China.\n\n498\n00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,241\nSo.\n>> So there's probably only a few hundred\n\n499\n00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,290\nmillion Wongs.\n\n500\n00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,633\nSo that's why your name is not personal,\npersonally identifiable.\n\n501\n00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,314\nYour e-mail address is also not.\n\n502\n00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,728\nPersonally identifiable information,\n\n503\n00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,391\nbecause it's something\nyou share with people.\n\n504\n00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:14,975\nThere's tons of people who\nknow my email address, right?\n\n505\n00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:15,710\ndon@itpro.tv.\n\n506\n00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,430\nIf you know that email address,\nthat doesn't mean that you're me,\n\n507\n00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,780\nyou just, you know my address.\n\n508\n00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,720\nGreat, right?\n\n509\n00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,150\nSo stuff like that, stuff you share,\nstuff you tell other people.\n\n510\n00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,420\nThat's not PII.\n\n511\n00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,990\nBut the personal information,\n\n512\n00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,280\nthe information you don't like to share,\nthat is.\n\n513\n00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,710\nAnd it's things like your\nsocial security number, right?\n\n514\n00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,180\nYour mother's maiden name.\n\n515\n00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,130\nThose security questions you answer.\n\n516\n00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,720\nThat's PII.\n\n517\n00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,980\nIf somebody wants to do identity theft,\nthey could call up a company that you had\n\n518\n00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,720\nan account with and say, hey,\nI've forgot password, can you help me out?\n\n519\n00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,910\nAnd they say oh yeah we can\nemail a password reset.\n\n520\n00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,120\nYou say well that's the problem,\nI don't have that email account any more.\n\n521\n00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,800\nWell what do they do?\n\n522\n00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,360\nThey're gonna say,\n\n523\n00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,490\nwell all right we need to validate\nthat you are who you say you are.\n\n524\n00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,020\nSo can you answer your security questions.\n\n525\n00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,755\nWhat is your, you know, last four\ndigits of your social security number?\n\n526\n00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,075\nWhat is your mother's maiden name?\n\n527\n00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,425\nWhere'd you graduate High School?\n\n528\n00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:09,975\nThose are things that are personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n529\n00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,182\nThat's making you unique, more unique\nthan just your name or email addresses.\n\n530\n00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:18,980\nAll right, and if you give those out,\nother people can impersonate you, and\n\n531\n00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,070\nthat's a, that's a real problem.\n\n532\n00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,940\nAnd that's a problem\ncelebrities are having.\n\n533\n00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,300\nWhy, why celebrity data keeps\ngetting hacked into and\n\n534\n00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,730\nleaked out, is that celebrities, they,\nthey put all their information out there,\n\n535\n00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,270\nand then they get compromised,\nthat's what happens.\n\n536\n00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,810\nSo, so they have to take\nextra precautions for that.\n\n537\n00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,520\nBut even you as a,\njust a regular run-of-the-mill person\n\n538\n00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,410\nhave to take precautions with\nsharing that information.\n\n539\n00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,100\nYeah.\n\n540\n00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,550\nAny time you get to a website that\nrequests that it should be secured, right?\n\n541\n00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,560\nYou wanna make sure you\nsee that lock symbol,\n\n542\n00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,210\nthat you got the green URL telling you\nthat you're using HTTPS, because that\n\n543\n00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,310\ninformation is just as sensitive as your\nbank account number or credit card number.\n\n544\n00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,310\n>> Yeah, and also remember, depending\non what you choose to download or,\n\n545\n00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,270\nor what,\nwhat websites you choose to go to.\n\n546\n00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,250\nMake a value judgement on whether or\n\n547\n00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,040\nnot you want to enter personally\nidentifiable information in that website.\n\n548\n00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,520\nSo you may come to one where you go okay,\nI need to.\n\n549\n00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,390\nThen do it.\n\n550\n00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,510\nBut you come to one and you're like I'm\njust downloading a piece of software, and\n\n551\n00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,560\nI'm just gonna try it for ten days,\nbut they're really asking me for\n\n552\n00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,970\na lot of information.\n\n553\n00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,230\nI may just go, I,\nI really don't need to deal with that.\n\n554\n00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,280\nAn, and that way I limit the amount\nof information that gets out there\n\n555\n00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,210\nfrom that one, website.\n\n556\n00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,800\n>> You know, one of the techniques I use,\nI learned from, Ronnie and\n\n557\n00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,270\nI have an old friend Charlie,\nCharlie if you're out there.\n\n558\n00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> Shout out to you but\n\n559\n00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,840\nhe had this great idea.\n\n560\n00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,310\nHe said, you know guys,\nwhen they ask you for\n\n561\n00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,962\nI, information like that,\nyou don't have to put the truth.\n\n562\n00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:42,466\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can put whatever you want.\n\n563\n00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,280\nAnd so, I, I don't know if I wanna\ngive away his, well I guess I know it.\n\n564\n00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,950\nSo what does it matter?\n\n565\n00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,070\nBut what he would do, is he would\nalways put this, this one entry,\n\n566\n00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,270\nwhich was, The Predator, right,\nfrom the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.\n\n567\n00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,120\nIt would say what's your\nmother's maiden name?\n\n568\n00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960\nThe Predator.\n\n569\n00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360\nWhat was the high school\nyou graduated from?\n\n570\n00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:57,950\nThe Predator.\n\n571\n00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,210\nHe would just put that for\nevery one of them.\n\n572\n00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,510\nAnd, it was funny cuz anytime he got\nasked that for the security question,\n\n573\n00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,630\nhe would, he would know the answer.\n\n574\n00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,945\nAnd you don't want to use the same one for\neverything, but, you know?\n\n575\n00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You make something up like that,\n\n576\n00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,040\nthey don't verify if it's true or not.\n\n577\n00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,120\nSo you don't actually have to\ngive that information out.\n\n578\n00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,050\nThat's a,\na good way to kind of avoid that.\n\n579\n00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,180\nSo whatever technique works for you.\n\n580\n00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,730\nJust be careful about that data.\n\n581\n00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,890\nThat data's becoming more and\nmore important as, you know,\n\n582\n00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,180\nthe society moves on, and, and the\nattackers get a lot more sophisticated.\n\n583\n00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:30,542\nAll right, well, we've got a little\nbit more to cover on this episode but\n\n584\n00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:34,221\nlet's stop here and take a break, and when\nwe get back we're gonna wrap up just a few\n\n585\n00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:37,612\nmore odds and ends before we close out\nSecurity for the certification cell.\n\n586\n00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:40,362\nStay tuned we'll be back after this.\n\n587\n00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:47,706\n[MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,465\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n589\n00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:51,895\nSo just a few more little points\nto hit on this objective.\n\n590\n00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:56,485\nAgain we're tackling how to ensure that\nwe have the safest experience possible\n\n591\n00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:57,905\nwhen browsing the web.\n\n592\n00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:01,005\nAnd often times the system doesn't\nprovide us with enough protection and\n\n593\n00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:03,082\nwe have to supplement that\nwith our own knowledge.\n\n594\n00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:08,172\nYeah, the next one that we have is,\nupdating our browsers and plugins.\n\n595\n00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:11,992\nYour web browser is a great way for\npeople to attack you, right.\n\n596\n00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:14,532\nTo get malicious software\ninstalled in your machine.\n\n597\n00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:17,520\nSo that is the number one place\nthat attackers are looking at.\n\n598\n00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,630\nThey could attack your operating system,\nbut\n\n599\n00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,090\nOSs have done a great job of becoming\na lot more secure than they used to be.\n\n600\n00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,160\nThey could attack other\napplications you run, but\n\n601\n00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,180\npeople don't spend as much time in other\napplications as they do a web browser.\n\n602\n00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,060\nAnd a web browser is always\nconnecting to the internet,\n\n603\n00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,780\nit's never connecting locally,\nwell I guess could in some scenario but\n\n604\n00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,860\nmost people are just connecting\nout to the internet.\n\n605\n00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,810\nSo attackers know that it's\na great way to get your system.\n\n606\n00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,880\nPeople also do a bad job of\nupdating their web browsers.\n\n607\n00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,420\nSo an exploit can be out for\nyour browser right now,\n\n608\n00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,010\nand there is an update that will fix it,\nbut you haven't applied it,\n\n609\n00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,530\nand so you're vulnerable to exploits\nthat attackers know and are using.\n\n610\n00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,650\nSo you've gotta keep your\nweb browser up to date.\n\n611\n00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,120\nIf you go into your Windows updates on a,\non a Microsoft system, and\n\n612\n00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,030\ntake a look at the updates\nyou're downloading,\n\n613\n00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,240\nyou'll see that almost half of them\nare Internet Explorer updates.\n\n614\n00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,230\nThey push a ton of updates out for that.\n\n615\n00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,410\nGoogle chrome.\n\n616\n00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,980\nI pick up a new update for\nGoogle chrome every handful of days, it,\n\n617\n00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,460\nit updates automatically.\n\n618\n00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,900\nBut it, it's grabbing them.\n\n619\n00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,230\nThey update their browsers to take care\nof the latest insecurity exploits,\n\n620\n00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,670\nas well as add new features and stuff.\n\n621\n00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,720\nBut it is important to do the updates.\n\n622\n00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,690\nAnd don't forget your add-ons, right?\n\n623\n00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,030\nIn chrome,\n\n624\n00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,510\nand Firefox, and Internet Explorer, they\nall have extensions that you can install.\n\n625\n00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,580\nThings that make the web browser\ndo more than what it natively did.\n\n626\n00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,920\nAnd those extensions get updates too.\n\n627\n00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,560\nSome of them can have exploits or\nvulnerabilities, and\n\n628\n00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,610\ndoing the updates can take care of that.\n\n629\n00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,370\nSo, that's where it kind of nice,\nlike Google Chrome,\n\n630\n00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,700\nwill updates its extensions\nautomatically for you.\n\n631\n00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,560\nInternet Explorer doesn't so it's kinda\nup to you to find a way to deal with it.\n\n632\n00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,780\nDifferent browsers have different support.\n\n633\n00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,590\n>> One of the things that we can also do\nto help us to be a little bit more secure\n\n634\n00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,340\nis, if you happen for one reason or\nanother to still be running Windows XP,\n\n635\n00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,820\nand you're still using Internet Explorer\n6, well that's using a really\n\n636\n00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,190\nolder operating system,\nalong with a really out of date browser.\n\n637\n00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,140\nAnd those particular vulnerabilities are\nno longer going to be patched anymore, so\n\n638\n00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,610\nalways as much as you can, you want to\nensure that your browser is going to up to\n\n639\n00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,810\ndate, and that you're not using\na legacy browser from way back when.\n\n640\n00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,580\n>> Yeah, and the,\nthe problem that people bump into is where\n\n641\n00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,510\noperating system you are using\nmight still be supported.\n\n642\n00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,960\nBut the original web\nbrowser can be very old.\n\n643\n00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,910\nAnd we see that with Windows 7\nwhere you install Windows 7 and\n\n644\n00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,760\nit's got Windows 7 shipped with IE8.\n\n645\n00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,750\nRight?\nWas it IE8?\n\n646\n00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,440\n>> 7 or 8 I don't.\n\n647\n00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,470\nI think it was.\n\n648\n00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,110\n>> I think it was 8.\n\n649\n00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,340\nWe'd have to double check but so you say,\n\n650\n00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,340\nall right well I'm just\ngonna stay with IE8.\n\n651\n00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,790\nAnd maybe IE9 or\nwhatever breaks something on your site.\n\n652\n00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,880\nSo you dont', you don't wanna use it.\n\n653\n00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,850\nYou wanna stay with 8.\n\n654\n00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,170\nWell, IE8, then there was nine, then there\nwas ten, and 11 is the current version.\n\n655\n00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,350\nYou're four versions\nbehind on that software.\n\n656\n00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,980\nThat's pretty far back, right.\n\n657\n00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,500\nSo don't use legacy software like that if\nyou can avoid it, and you'll bump into\n\n658\n00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,395\neventually, where webs web developers\nwill stop supporting your browser.\n\n659\n00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:10,085\nAnd so websites won't look right, things\nget broken, things don't display properly.\n\n660\n00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,715\nSo you do want to update to the latest\nbrowsers whenever possible.\n\n661\n00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:18,685\nAll right the other thing is those add\nons, you might install them, there might\n\n662\n00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:22,620\nbe some package with your system already\nor you might inadvertently get some.\n\n663\n00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,190\nSo, a way to ensure that you have\nthe safest browsing experience is to\n\n664\n00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,130\ndisable any of those add-ons\nthat you're not using.\n\n665\n00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,430\nNow, if they were legitimately installed,\n\n666\n00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,650\nit's pretty easy to get\nthose out of there, right?\n\n667\n00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,928\nEach of the web browsers has their\nown little way of, of managing that.\n\n668\n00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,490\nAnd what,, what, what browser\ndo you have fired up over there?\n\n669\n00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,350\n>> I went ahead and I have Google Chrome\nfired, fired, fired up I can't say it.\n\n670\n00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,960\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, Google Chrome fired and what I\n\n671\n00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,670\ndid is I went over here tot he right\nhand side on these three little bars,\n\n672\n00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,730\nI clicked and brought up this menu.\n\n673\n00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,060\nAnd then I went down to More Tools and\nI selected Extensions.\n\n674\n00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,819\nSo, here they don't call them add-ins,\ntechnically they call them extensions.\n\n675\n00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:05,279\nAnd that brought me up to\nthe different extensions that are now\n\n676\n00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,586\nenabled on my webpage and\nI do use Google Docs and Hangouts.\n\n677\n00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:11,593\nAnd then last pass.\n\n678\n00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:14,980\nBut notice down here at the bottom\nI can actually get more.\n\n679\n00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,710\nIf I really weren't using these, and\n\n680\n00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,310\nthey were still on there, I may want to go\nahead and disable them because it is just\n\n681\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,090\nleaving another entry point for\nsomebody to be able to attack.\n\n682\n00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n683\n00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,670\n>> So it, it is important to turn those\noff if you're not gonna use them.\n\n684\n00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,470\nIn Internet Explorer\nthey're called add-ons, and\n\n685\n00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,660\nit's a slightly different place here,\nI can, I can show that on my machine.\n\n686\n00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,530\nI've got an Internet Explorer system\npulled up and if I go up to Settings up\n\n687\n00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,890\ntop, you'll see Manage add-ons, and that's\nwhere we an see all of our tool bars and\n\n688\n00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,300\nextensions, search providers and,\nand so on.\n\n689\n00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,420\nSo you can see these.\n\n690\n00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,945\nThis is a, a real clean system here so\nI, I've only got the defaults.\n\n691\n00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,115\nBut if you see a new toolbar.\n\n692\n00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,365\n>> Right.\n>> Like the ask.com toolbar show up,\n\n693\n00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:52,915\nyou could come in here and remove that.\n\n694\n00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:55,115\nNow it'll show up under Add and\nRemove Programs also.\n\n695\n00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:58,165\nSo you could go into Control Panel and\nuninstall it if you know you're never\n\n696\n00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:02,217\ngoing to need it again,\nif it's a legitimate toolbar, right?\n\n697\n00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:04,797\nIf this is a malicious one,\nif it's packaged as a Trojan or\n\n698\n00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:09,137\nwith a virus, then you might remove\nit here and it adds itself back.\n\n699\n00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:12,367\nAnd it might not show up under Add and\nRemove Programs, and at that point your\n\n700\n00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,747\nsystem has been compromised and so you've\ngot to go through corrective action.\n\n701\n00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:19,860\nSo we do have to be careful and\nmanage those add-ons.\n\n702\n00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,931\nNow with Internet Explorer there's\na neat utility out there I wanna show\n\n703\n00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,200\nyou guys called HijackThis.\n\n704\n00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,510\nI mentioned it earlier in the show.\n\n705\n00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,460\nIts from Trend Micro,\nand I downloaded this,\n\n706\n00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,640\nso I've got it right here,\nHijackThis, and it's a neat utility.\n\n707\n00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,950\nIt was developed by just\nan individual person years ago and\n\n708\n00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,255\nthen they sold it to to Trend Micro.\n\n709\n00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:43,540\nAnd what it does is it reads\nthe configuration of Internet Explorer and\n\n710\n00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,620\nit shows all the stuff\nthat's attached to it.\n\n711\n00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,100\nThere's more than what shows up on\nthat add-on screen that you don't see.\n\n712\n00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,030\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat's in the registry.\n\n713\n00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,200\nThere's some stuff that's in\nFile Configurations on the hard drive, and\n\n714\n00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,970\nthere's yet other things that are in the,\nwell, Manage Add-ons section.\n\n715\n00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,750\nAnd so, data is spread across\nseveral places on your computer, and\n\n716\n00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,290\nwhat HijackThis can do is it can go and\nfind all that.\n\n717\n00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,270\nI'm gonna run it as an administrator here,\nso\n\n718\n00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,880\nit'll have access to\neverything that I need.\n\n719\n00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,640\nI'll accept this license agreement, and\n\n720\n00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,930\nthen I'm gonna have it do a system's scan,\nall right?\n\n721\n00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,020\nSo it's gonna scan and\nit'll generate a log file too,\n\n722\n00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,710\nwhich you can use to turn\nover to experts for review.\n\n723\n00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,170\nBut but we'll go ahead and do a scan.\n\n724\n00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,890\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna show\nme all of the things that are attached\n\n725\n00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,410\nto Internet Explorer.\n\n726\n00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,320\nNow you guys saw when I\nwent into Manage Add-ons,\n\n727\n00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,380\nthere really wasn't all\nthat much in there.\n\n728\n00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,370\nBut looking in here, I see a lot of stuff.\n\n729\n00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,420\nI see things that are,\nare dictating what my home page is.\n\n730\n00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,110\nWhat my search.\n\n731\n00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,090\nSo here's my start page.\n\n732\n00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,690\nThat's my home page right there.\n\n733\n00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,270\nI can see my main search page when I do\nsearches and each of those are defined.\n\n734\n00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,910\nIf you have a malicious software\nattached to your web browser,\n\n735\n00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:56,390\nthey're often attached as what are called\nBHOs, Browser Hook Objects, and\n\n736\n00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,080\nthese are things that interact\nwith Internet Explorer.\n\n737\n00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,510\nAnd you do one action, like try to go\nto Google, and it intercepts it and\n\n738\n00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,450\nturns it into something else, and\nsends you to a different place.\n\n739\n00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,890\nAnd those will show up in here.\n\n740\n00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,150\nThis is combining all of that.\n\n741\n00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,520\nMost of this is from the registry, but\n\n742\n00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,588\nyou'll see it's different places in\nthat registry, it's spread out all over.\n\n743\n00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:16,780\nOther things are services that\nare running in the background.\n\n744\n00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,320\nAnd so I can see here I've got\nthe Bonjour service running.\n\n745\n00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,560\nAnd it's got a DNS responder put inside\nof it for doing multicasting NES.\n\n746\n00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,240\nSo it's got some different things that are\nattached and I might not know about that.\n\n747\n00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,600\nMaybe I didn't do that.\n\n748\n00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,460\nHeck, I've got some files missing and\nI, I've got a clean install, so\n\n749\n00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,640\nI don't know why that would be.\n\n750\n00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,212\nBut it says that I've got some\nfiles missing that should be there.\n\n751\n00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:38,770\nSo HijackThis just displays it all in one\nplace instead of having you go to all\n\n752\n00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,760\nthe different ones.\n\n753\n00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,340\nBut oftentimes you can spot software\nin here that shouldn't be there.\n\n754\n00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,230\nThings that, that you didn't install\nthat you're not aware of, and\n\n755\n00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,900\nit shows the path to them so\nyou can identify what they are, right.\n\n756\n00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,920\nThere are many companies that make\ntools like this that will help\n\n757\n00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,600\nto identify that software\nthat shouldn't be there.\n\n758\n00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,640\nMost of the malicious software\nout there is pretty advanced.\n\n759\n00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,560\nAnd so it'll take steps to hide itself.\n\n760\n00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,550\nAnd it can't hide itself from\nutilities like these, but\n\n761\n00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,490\nfrom the built-in browser\nutilities it can.\n\n762\n00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,570\nSo just be aware that stuff can\nbe lurking in the background.\n\n763\n00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,640\nNow if you're using this tool and\nyou wanna disable something, so, you know,\n\n764\n00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,440\nyou might find something\nthat well you really,\n\n765\n00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,570\nall these guys that are saying missing\nfiles, I could kinda remove them.\n\n766\n00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,018\nBut but you can go through and\nfind something you know you don't need\n\n767\n00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:25,820\nlike I don't know why the Volume Shadow\nService would need an entry in here.\n\n768\n00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,470\nBut you can just check things off,\nand then when you hit Fix Check,\n\n769\n00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,940\nit'll disable them and you reboot\nyour computer and now they're gone.\n\n770\n00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,570\nAnd in the meantime,\nit generated this log file,\n\n771\n00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,505\nso you've got a record of\nall the stuff that it found.\n\n772\n00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:41,950\nDo here's all the things that it found and\nyou can analyze that and\n\n773\n00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,572\ncompare it with other systems to see\nif you're any different than they are.\n\n774\n00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:48,000\nAll right, so plenty of tools\nlike that that are available, but\n\n775\n00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,060\njust keep an eye on that extra software\nthat gets attached to your web browser.\n\n776\n00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,780\nThe more you have the slower\nthe performance of your web browser gets.\n\n777\n00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,310\nSo if you see you're getting\nreally slow web access,\n\n778\n00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,530\nit may be caused by add-ons on your own\nsystem and not your Internet bandwidth.\n\n779\n00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,360\nAll right, what is next on our list?\n\n780\n00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,070\nOh, just personal privacy stuff, right?\n\n781\n00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,010\nStuff.\n\n782\n00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,820\nSo when you perform actions\nin your web browser,\n\n783\n00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,150\nyou're actually creating a local\ncache of everything that you do.\n\n784\n00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,440\nThe websites you visit,\nthe forms that you filled out,\n\n785\n00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440\neven the passwords in some cases.\n\n786\n00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,010\nThat all gets stored as part\nof the browsing session.\n\n787\n00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,140\nAnd if your machine is not secured,\nsomebody could gain access to\n\n788\n00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,630\nthat browsing session and\nsee what you've been doing.\n\n789\n00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,790\nSee what websites you went to, pull\npasswords out of the password database,\n\n790\n00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,880\npull the cookies, you know, that, that\nidentify your session on various servers.\n\n791\n00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,440\nThat data is, well it can, be sensitive.\n\n792\n00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,290\nI mean, if you just go to ESPN all\nthe time, then it's not sensitive.\n\n793\n00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,230\nBut, but if you've been going\nto e-commerce sites and so on,\n\n794\n00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,400\nthen, then it can be\nreally sensitive data.\n\n795\n00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,270\nSo if you want the best\nprotection possible,\n\n796\n00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,500\nyou might choose to clear that data out,\nright?\n\n797\n00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,940\nNow most browsers have that functionality,\nyou can go in their settings,\n\n798\n00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,350\nlet me do that here.\n\n799\n00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,840\nSo I'm gonna go back\ninto Internet Explorer.\n\n800\n00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,160\nAnd in Internet Explorer if I go up\nhere to my little gear button, and\n\n801\n00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,080\nI'll go into Internet Options.\n\n802\n00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,010\nAnd then in my Internet Options I\nsee some various stuff.\n\n803\n00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,420\nAnd I've got right here Browsing History\nand I've got a Delete button.\n\n804\n00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,770\nAnd I can hit Delete, and I can clear\nout way more than just browsing history.\n\n805\n00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,660\nBrowsing history are the, are the sites\nthat I've visited in the past, but\n\n806\n00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,980\nhere I can wipe out form data and\npasswords.\n\n807\n00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,410\nTracking protection, as far as ActiveX\ndo not track settings, download history.\n\n808\n00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,330\nAll this stuff,\n\n809\n00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,730\nit's a record of where I've been,\nwhat I've done, I can wipe that out.\n\n810\n00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,090\nAnd if this is a shared computer,\nthat may be important.\n\n811\n00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,862\nI don't want people to, to be able to pull\nup the information that I, I went to.\n\n812\n00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:46,060\nAll right, now,\nthis is just a one time thing.\n\n813\n00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,270\nIf I hit Delete,\nit's gonna delete it right now,\n\n814\n00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,240\nand then it's gonna start\ncollecting the data again.\n\n815\n00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,090\nSo if this is something that\nyou don't want to have happen,\n\n816\n00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,310\nyou'll see a few other options.\n\n817\n00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,280\nYou can say Delete\nbrowsing history on exit.\n\n818\n00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,245\nNow every time you close the browser,\nit'll automatically wipe out that history.\n\n819\n00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,965\nOr if you go into Settings,\n\n820\n00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:08,185\nyou can actually set that to happen\nat certain times, or other things.\n\n821\n00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:10,975\nYou can do all sorts of neat\nstuff in here to manipulate that.\n\n822\n00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:14,845\nSo this is all part of extending\nprivacy on a shared computer.\n\n823\n00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,105\nOn a dedicated computer,\n\n824\n00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:19,495\none that's just yours, all these features\nare great, you'd probably want them.\n\n825\n00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:23,145\nI like that I don't have to type in a\nwhole web address anymore cuz the browser\n\n826\n00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:24,570\nremembers where I went to.\n\n827\n00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,810\nBut some people don't.\n\n828\n00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,020\nYeah, I absolutely hate it\nwhen I have to clear my\n\n829\n00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,320\nweb history because I can't\nremember half the URLs I go to.\n\n830\n00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,240\nYou know, it's,\nit's kinda nice to have it.\n\n831\n00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n832\n00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,590\nThe other one that they\nalso mention is form data.\n\n833\n00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,600\nThere's a lot of time when you go\nautomatically on, onto a website and\n\n834\n00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,700\nyou fill out a form.\n\n835\n00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,880\nAnd sometimes the information\nautomatically appears in there, and\n\n836\n00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,540\nthat is because your\nbrowser can reach out and\n\n837\n00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,260\nactually go ahead and\ncache that data in there too.\n\n838\n00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,750\nSo, Nate not Nate.\n\n839\n00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,650\nSorry, Don, do you wanna take\na look at that or are we.\n\n840\n00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,440\n>> Let's see, the form data?\n\n841\n00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,940\nOh, yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n842\n00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,110\n>> So I, I actually just cleared\n\n843\n00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,790\nit with the other data.\n\n844\n00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,340\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n845\n00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,770\n>> So if I,\nif I take Internet Explorer here.\n\n846\n00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,891\nAnd, you know, what would be\na good place that has a form?\n\n847\n00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,958\nI, you know, actually here.\n\n848\n00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,129\nWe'll, we'll go to ITProTV.\n\n849\n00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:08,209\nWhat is it?\nContact us?\n\n850\n00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,835\nIs that our contact form?\n\n851\n00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:13,843\nRight contact dash os something.\n\n852\n00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,440\nSo we have a contact form on our website.\n\n853\n00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,360\nHere it is.\n\n854\n00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,970\nAnd we go in and fill this out right?\n\n855\n00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,760\nSo name, email and so on.\n\n856\n00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,910\nSo I might fill this out\nI'll put that on me and\n\n857\n00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,420\nhere's my email address whoops\nwhich I can't spell, alright.\n\n858\n00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,560\nAnd I'm just gonna say\ntest ticket please ignore.\n\n859\n00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,010\nAll right.\n\n860\n00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,460\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate this test.\n\n861\n00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,230\nAnd I'll go ahead and send it.\n\n862\n00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,990\nSo I just filled out that form,\nand there we go.\n\n863\n00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,140\nNow if I come back to\nthis page in the future,\n\n864\n00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,400\nthe browser will actually\nremember a lot of what I typed.\n\n865\n00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,880\nSo I don't have to type it again.\n\n866\n00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,000\nAnd so when I go to name, and start to\ntype, it may remember it and suggest that,\n\n867\n00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,705\nand apparently ours doesn't do that.\n\n868\n00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:58,050\n[LAUGH] It doesn't always work, and\napparently that's the case here, so.\n\n869\n00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,880\nYou know, let me do this,\nlet me close that, oh.\n\n870\n00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720\nDid I, I didn't disable it a minute ago,\ndid I?\n\n871\n00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,940\n>> I don't remember.\n\n872\n00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,645\n>> Well try this again.\n\n873\n00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:05,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n874\n00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,210\nSo the, the whole point of the form\nfill thought is that it automatically\n\n875\n00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,260\nfills that stuff in so\nthat you don't have to.\n\n876\n00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,010\nAnd well, you know,\nlike here's my browsing history.\n\n877\n00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,010\nSee how it's got the where I've been and\nso I see that ITProTV form in there and\n\n878\n00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,250\nI can go back to it.\n\n879\n00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,770\nAnd it may or may not actually [LAUGH],\nStop hopping on me about\n\n880\n00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,300\nbeing the default browser, there we\ngo and, ya its just not gonna do it.\n\n881\n00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,140\nWell this is a bad example then.\n\n882\n00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,270\nSo, but it'll drop down and\nyou'll see this stuff.\n\n883\n00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,430\nNow the positive side is if you're\nfilling out a form in repetition\n\n884\n00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,720\nthat's really useful.\n\n885\n00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,830\nOn a negative side, if somebody\nelse comes to use this computer,\n\n886\n00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,110\nthey can double click on these\nfields to see what you typed.\n\n887\n00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,230\nRight?\nAnd, and that's definitely not\n\n888\n00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,240\nsomething that you want.\n\n889\n00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,180\nSo clearing out that data helps.\n\n890\n00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,210\nAnd yeah, I cleared that out just\na minute ago with a refresh.\n\n891\n00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,590\nWe go back into our internet options.\n\n892\n00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,140\nSo I'll go to my settings here,\ninternet options.\n\n893\n00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,790\nIn here where I did my browsing history,\nwhen I hit Delete,\n\n894\n00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,400\nthat was this form data right here.\n\n895\n00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520\nThat was the one that wiped that out.\n\n896\n00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,950\nThey, the you know, autofill-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n897\n00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,400\n>> Settings that wiped, that put that in.\n\n898\n00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,950\nAnd you can actually disable autofill.\n\n899\n00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,300\nI don't know if I remember\nwhere that setting is.\n\n900\n00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,320\n>> You can go\n>> Do you remember?\n\n901\n00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,400\n>> In to content and then auto complete.\n\n902\n00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,260\n>> Right there.\n\n903\n00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,100\nSo you can just disable it out right.\n\n904\n00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,700\nHere and turn it off so\nthen it won't remember any of that.\n\n905\n00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,190\nHere I'll just go through and\nturn that off, no names and passwords,\n\n906\n00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,995\nno address bar and\nI'll go delete my settings again.\n\n907\n00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:24,755\nSo let's wipe that out,\nand we'll start over.\n\n908\n00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:25,485\nSo I'm gonna wipe that out,\n\n909\n00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:27,292\njust give it a second while it wipes it,\nand now close it.\n\n910\n00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:32,165\nNow a minute ago when I started typing\nin the address bar it remembered where I\n\n911\n00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:36,022\nwent, and now if I start typing,\nit doesn't remember.\n\n912\n00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:40,642\nNo suggestion to get back to that contact\nus form, so instead of having to delete\n\n913\n00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,092\nit every time, we just turn it\noff outright and that's that.\n\n914\n00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,321\nAll right, the other thing is,\nyour web browser of choice\n\n915\n00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:52,431\nprobably has additional security\nmechanisms that are in it.\n\n916\n00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,951\nIt varies by browser.\n\n917\n00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:57,485\nSome of them are really advanced, some\nof them are very simple, like Firefox.\n\n918\n00:42:57,485 --> 00:43:01,555\nFirefox, if you go to a site that has\nan invalid certificate, it won't let you,\n\n919\n00:43:01,555 --> 00:43:02,575\nit stops you.\n\n920\n00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:05,095\nTechnically, you could go ahead and\nuse the invalid certificate and\n\n921\n00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:07,225\naccess the site, but\nit stops you outright.\n\n922\n00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:10,140\nSo it's got a little tighter protection\nthan some of the other browsers.\n\n923\n00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,490\nThe other browsers will warn you,\nbut they won't actually stop you.\n\n924\n00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:12,990\nRight?\n\n925\n00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,770\nInternet Explorer has some neat software\nwhere it checks files that you download.\n\n926\n00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,660\nIt does this reputation testing.\n\n927\n00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,170\nSo if it's a file that's been downloaded\nby millions of users across the planet,\n\n928\n00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,240\nit knows that it's safe.\n\n929\n00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,190\nIt'll download, and, and off you go.\n\n930\n00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,130\nBut if it's software that it doesn't\nknow a lot about, if it hasn't heard it,\n\n931\n00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,230\nit'll say, this software is\ncoming from a not-trusted source.\n\n932\n00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,170\nDo you wanna run it?\n\n933\n00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,630\nRight?\nIt's a neat little feature.\n\n934\n00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,400\nSo you might have encountered this before,\nwhere you click to download a file.\n\n935\n00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,200\nAnd Windows pops up a giant\nmessage that says warning,\n\n936\n00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,180\nyou're about to run a program\nthat is not trusted.\n\n937\n00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,080\nDo you want to continue?\n\n938\n00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,650\nAnd you'll get this when\nyou download files from\n\n939\n00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,190\nwebsites that are just not very popular or\nsoftware that for\n\n940\n00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,000\nwhatever reason has been kind\nof red-flagged by Microsoft.\n\n941\n00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,980\nAnd it may be perfectly legitimate and\nsafe, it's just not popular.\n\n942\n00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,690\nYou find out when you download a lot\nof little utilities from companies you\n\n943\n00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,250\nnever heard of.\n\n944\n00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,870\nYou need something very specific and\nhe finds them, and\n\n945\n00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,020\nhe wrote a free program that does it.\n\n946\n00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,900\nMicrosoft's just never seen\nthat program before and\n\n947\n00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,840\nso they've given you a fair warning.\n\n948\n00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,870\nYou can easily over ride it.\n\n949\n00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,640\nThat's one of the nice\nthings about SmartScreen is,\n\n950\n00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,070\nyou do have control over it, and you can\nturn it off all together if you wanted.\n\n951\n00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,720\nOther systems have that too, like in MAC\nOS there's the whole Gatekeeper system,\n\n952\n00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,180\nand whenever you download a program from\nthe internet, it stops it from running and\n\n953\n00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,850\nif you double click on it, it warns you.\n\n954\n00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,870\nIt's says this program is downloaded from\nthe internet, do you want to open it?\n\n955\n00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,890\nAnd you can choose open and\nit will pop it up then too.\n\n956\n00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,250\nSo a lot of operating systems are\nprotecting you from untrusted software.\n\n957\n00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,670\nJust software that, that isn't digitally\nsigned, that isn't fully approved.\n\n958\n00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:48,730\nAlright, the last thing\nthat we've got is the risk\n\n959\n00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,050\nof using a public workstation and, and for\na lot of us this is common sense, but for\n\n960\n00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,370\npeople who are new to IT, this is\nsomething, it's important to understand.\n\n961\n00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:01,950\nThere have been several high visibility\nincidents over the years where\n\n962\n00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,420\npeople used a shared public computer and\nhad their information compromised, right?\n\n963\n00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,500\nOne of the biggest examples\nwas here in the United States,\n\n964\n00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,950\nthere's a company called Kinko's.\n\n965\n00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,640\nThey're actually owned by FedEx.\n\n966\n00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,420\nBut Kinko's, it was a copy location so\n\n967\n00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,540\nyou could go and\nuse their photocopiers to make documents.\n\n968\n00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,760\nThey printed things.\n\n969\n00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,390\nBut they also had computers available for\nrent.\n\n970\n00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,460\nYou could rent access to a computer\nif you were travelling, and\n\n971\n00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,070\nyou could do your work, and then leave.\n\n972\n00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:32,170\nWell, people were installing key loggers\non those machines, and so you'd go and\n\n973\n00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,010\nrent time on that Kinko's computer, and\nyou'd sit down and check your email and\n\n974\n00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,940\ndo all that stuff, meanwhile, everything\nyou're doing is being logged, and,\n\n975\n00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,920\nthe attackers are just wait a few\nweeks and they would go back and\n\n976\n00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,950\nrent the machine for an hour and\ncollect the data and walk off with it.\n\n977\n00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,040\nAnd so they were harvesting user names and\npasswords left and right,\n\n978\n00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:53,630\nall over and that's one of the big\nrisks with using a public computer.\n\n979\n00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:57,010\nNow, there's many different software\npackages all across the internet that,\n\n980\n00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,510\nthat tell you they can help\nto secure that environment.\n\n981\n00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,780\nBut my solution?\n\n982\n00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,210\nI never,\never use publicly available computers.\n\n983\n00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,410\nIn my opinion, the hotels really\nshouldn't even offer them.\n\n984\n00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,870\nI do not trust publicly\navailable computers,\n\n985\n00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,330\nno matter what has been\ndone to secure them.\n\n986\n00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,630\nBut, if you have to use one,\n\n987\n00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:18,320\nif you have no other choice, you've gotta\nto make sure you do simple procedures.\n\n988\n00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,150\nAnything you access should be encrypted.\n\n989\n00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,530\nYou should be clearing your cache.\n\n990\n00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,080\nBut really, even if you do all that,\nthe core OS could be compromised.\n\n991\n00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,030\nI do know some people who carry around\nlive CDs, to boot off of the live CDs and\n\n992\n00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,310\nnot actually boot off of what's on disk.\n\n993\n00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,680\nThat can work, but your network traffic\ncould still be getting intercepted.\n\n994\n00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,730\nAnd usually when you boot\nfrom one of those live CDs,\n\n995\n00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,340\nyou lose whatever configuration was on the\nnetwork that was allowing that PC to talk\n\n996\n00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,390\nin the first place.\n\n997\n00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,950\nAnd so you may get blocked by\nthe firewall for that organization.\n\n998\n00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,270\nIt may or may not work.\n\n999\n00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,460\nThere were several companies that\nwere making bootable USB keys, and\n\n1000\n00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,860\nMicrosoft even has Windows to go now where\nyou can have Windows installed on a USB\n\n1001\n00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,300\nkey and\nboot your entire Windows environment.\n\n1002\n00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,440\nNow it's an OS you trust, and\n\n1003\n00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,320\nyou're really just renting\nThe hardware not the OS anymore.\n\n1004\n00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,700\nSo, shared public work stations\nthey're just a danger zone.\n\n1005\n00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,450\nDo not use them for\nother than like checking the news.\n\n1006\n00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,620\nRight like you wouldn't want to log in to\nyour own personal accounts or whatever.\n\n1007\n00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,008\nWhen using a shredder machine.\n\n1008\n00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:17,510\n>> Agree?\n\n1009\n00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n1010\n00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,130\n>> I bet you do that all the time, Ronnie,\n\n1011\n00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,120\nbut,\n>> I do.\n\n1012\n00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,010\n>> Risk taker.\n\n1013\n00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,480\n>> I am.\n>> [LAUGH] The way I look at it is if\n\n1014\n00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,560\nsomebody else logs into my email\nthey're kinda helping me out.\n\n1015\n00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,510\nYou know, maybe they can answer a few\nemails, cut down on the work load.\n\n1016\n00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,450\n>> Sounds good.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well.\n\n1017\n00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,910\nI do apologize if some of this\nseemed like common sense.\n\n1018\n00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,950\nSome of it is.\n\n1019\n00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,690\nBut for people getting started in IT,\n\n1020\n00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,440\na lot of this isn't something that\nwe think about on a regular basis.\n\n1021\n00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,340\nAnd you can never be too safe.\n\n1022\n00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,915\nYou've gotta take\nthe standard precautions.\n\n1023\n00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:49,435\nTo insure your data stays your data and\nnot somebody elses.\n\n1024\n00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:53,505\nAll right, well that's about\nall we've got for security.\n\n1025\n00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:55,655\nKeep in mind there's one of\nthe bigger sections on these,\n\n1026\n00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:58,045\nit's not the biggest, but it's close.\n\n1027\n00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:02,165\nSo be aware of it, make sure you\nunderstand all the different practices\n\n1028\n00:48:02,165 --> 00:48:04,925\nwe talked about in this section and\nyou'll be in good shape.\n\n1029\n00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,160\nSo.\n\n1030\n00:48:06,160 -->

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,174\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:41,812\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,000\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,080\n>> It is going swell.\n\n8\n00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,900\nI too, like Taylor Swift, have removed\nmy entire album collection from Spotify.\n\n9\n00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,570\n>> You know, is that why\nthe radio has been silent here?\n\n10\n00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,870\n>> It

weren't,\n\n13\n00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,740\nbut anyhow.\n\n14\n00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,790\nSo we're back here with another\nepisode of CompTIA Fundamentals, and\n\n15\n00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,330\nwe're jumping into Objective 4.0,\nwhich is networking.\n\n16\n00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,600\nSo, we've got a lot of networking stuff\nto tackle in the next few episodes.\n\n17\n00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,560\nIn this one we're doing 4.1\nanother nice long Objective name.\n\n18\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,558\nGiven a scenario setup and configure\na basic SOHO router, wired / wireless.\n\n19\n00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:23,092\nAll right?\n\n20\n00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:24,415\nNice long title for us.\n\n21\n00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:28,550\nIn most small office,\nhome office environments, right?\n\n22\n00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,090\nThat's what SOHO stands for.\n\n23\n00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,310\nSmall office, being you know, a,\n\n24\n00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,780\na business office that might only have a\nhandful of employees, four or five people,\n\n25\n00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,710\nyou know, not something very large.\n\n26\n00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,270\nA home office might be an employee\nthat just works from home.\n\n27\n00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,910\nAnd in those environments,\n\n28\n00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,890\nwe'll typically have network gear\nthat a regular home might not have.\n\n29\n00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390\nAnd I know that,\nthat line's gotten blurred a lot as\n\n30\n00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,370\nthings like wireless routers\nhave become a lot cheaper.\n\n31\n00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,420\nSo or, I'm sorry, less expensive.\n\n32\n00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,150\nYou're not supposed to say cheaper,\nit makes them sound cheap.\n\n33\n00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,590\nBut [LAUGH] so, so\nthese are pretty commonplace now.\n\n34\n00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,040\nSo we now have a basic understanding\nhow to whip one of those things up.\n\n35\n00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,900\nHow to get a wireless router setup in an\nenvironment to provide internet access to\n\n36\n00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,910\nmore than one PC, laptop,\ntablet, phone, whatever.\n\n37\n00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,415\n>> Now, I, I, I think all I need to\ndo is buy one, take it outta the box,\n\n38\n00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,250\nplug it in, and everything works.\n\n39\n00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,480\n>> Sad.\n>> I think that's all I need to do.\n\n40\n00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,300\n>> Sadly, you can do that.\n\n41\n00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,690\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, mo, mo, most of these things you\n\n42\n00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,580\ncan take right outta the box,\nplug them in and they will work.\n\n43\n00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,850\nBut, there,\nthere's a lot of stuff wrong with that.\n\n44\n00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,950\n>> Right.\n>> Right, well what are some of the things\n\n45\n00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,909\nthat we're gonna have that are wrong?\n\n46\n00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,560\nTypically, the wireless network\nis turned on and not secured,\n\n47\n00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,290\nno password, whatsoever.\n\n48\n00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,330\nSo anybody can jump on\nyour wireless network.\n\n49\n00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,950\nWhat were some of the other things that\nare wrong with a, a default config?\n\n50\n00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,240\n>> Well, because it's unsecured,\nthey have a default configuration,\n\n51\n00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,030\nwhich means that anybody that's\nhacking probably already knows what\n\n52\n00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,750\nthe password is to the router itself.\n\n53\n00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,320\nWhich means they can configure it, and\neven lock you out of your own router.\n\n54\n00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,800\n>> Even if they don't know the password,\nif they see that default wireless name,\n\n55\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,220\nthey're easy to spot.\n\n56\n00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,430\nAll you have to do is go and\npull the manual for that router.\n\n57\n00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,060\nAnd a lot of companies like Netgear have\nbeen using the same default user name\n\n58\n00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,790\npassword combination for\na long, long time.\n\n59\n00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,050\nSo they can just look it up in\nthe support manual for your,\n\n60\n00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,870\nyour router and access it.\n\n61\n00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,580\nSo while you can take a lot of these\nout of the box, plug them in and\n\n62\n00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,320\njust let it go, you don't want to do that.\n\n63\n00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,410\nYou'll have a unsecure wireless\nnetwork and that's, that's dangerous.\n\n64\n00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,390\nSo we need to go in and\nmodify that default config and\n\n65\n00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,790\nthat's what we're gonna take\na look at in this show.\n\n66\n00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,220\nCompTIA calls out several\nitems here in the list.\n\n67\n00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,370\nIt's, like seven things,\nI guess, or eight?\n\n68\n00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,630\n>> Eight.\n>> Eight things.\n\n69\n00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,530\nEight things that we need to remember to\ngo in and check and modify, to make our\n\n70\n00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,500\nnetwork more secure, more stable, and\nto make it just work for us properly.\n\n71\n00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,190\nNow, we're gonna show you on a very,\n\n72\n00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,330\nvery common router during this show, but\nyou may have one from a different vendor.\n\n73\n00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,930\nThe options are typically going\nto be the same, but the menus and\n\n74\n00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,000\nthe screens might be\na little bit different.\n\n75\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,890\nSo you, you're looking for the same\nthings, they're just in different places.\n\n76\n00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,970\nSo what we're gonna show\nyou is fairly generic,\n\n77\n00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,910\neven though we're going to use\nthe Linksys/Cisco router here.\n\n78\n00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,410\nIt, you could,\ncould be using any of a number of routers.\n\n79\n00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,040\nAll right, so when I get a brand\nnew wireless router, and I go and\n\n80\n00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,670\nthrow it on the network,\nI want my PCs to be able to connect to it.\n\n81\n00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,922\nAnd for a wired PC that's\npretty straightforward, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,269\nIf it was a cable, I'd plug it in.\n\n83\n00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,550\nFor a wireless we have to get\nthe wireless network set up.\n\n84\n00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,200\nBut, even before that we need to start\nwith the internet connection itself.\n\n85\n00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,110\nAll right.\n\n86\n00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,990\nIf you're putting\na wireless router at home,\n\n87\n00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,430\nit's gotta connect to\nthe internet somehow.\n\n88\n00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,560\nAnd there's two main ways, there's DSL and\ncable high speed internet, right?\n\n89\n00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800\nOr cable broadband.\n\n90\n00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,890\nSo those are the two main\ntypes of connections you have.\n\n91\n00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,485\nThere, there's other ones, right, Ronnie?\n\n92\n00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,190\nYou've got, what is your?\n\n93\n00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,920\n>> Satellite.\n\n94\n00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,080\n>> What's yours officially called?\n\n95\n00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,934\nDo you know?\n>> Mine is officially called Wildblue.com\n\n96\n00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,080\nsatellite.\n\n97\n00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,940\n>> So I, I know that, that there's like\nsome different standards in there to,\n\n98\n00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,930\nI don't know them myself.\n\n99\n00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,560\nBut I know they have some.\n\n100\n00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600\nSo there are other variety of\nthings that are out there.\n\n101\n00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,930\nBut the most common ones are DSL and\ncable.\n\n102\n00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,570\nWhich is not available in ever area.\n\n103\n00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,030\nWhich Ronnie can tell\nyou all too much about.\n\n104\n00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,620\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,360\n>> [LAUGH] So when we get that right,\nwhen we get cable or\n\n106\n00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,350\nDSL they're gonna put\na device in called a modem.\n\n107\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,210\nAnd the modem is basically a translator,\nit's translating data coming off of\n\n108\n00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,320\ntheir line into a format that is ready for\nyour equipment.\n\n109\n00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,290\nAnd vice versa,\nit's taking data from your equipment and\n\n110\n00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,112\ntranslating it into a format that\nwill work across that DSL cable.\n\n111\n00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,660\nAll right, that's all a modem does.\n\n112\n00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,350\nSo on the modem,\n\n113\n00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,440\nthere really is no configuration\nthat you need to worry about.\n\n114\n00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360\nYour service provider takes care of that.\n\n115\n00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,580\nSo if it's DSL,\nyou plug a phone line into the DSL modem.\n\n116\n00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,360\nIf it's cable broadband, you screw\nthe cable connector onto the cable modem.\n\n117\n00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,730\nBut then, they just have a regular network\njack right on an RJ45 network jack, and\n\n118\n00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,660\nyou run regular network cable\nright into your router.\n\n119\n00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,760\nYour router will typically have\nmultiple interfaces on it.\n\n120\n00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,550\nAnd, one of them will be designates\nas a WAN port, Wide Area Network.\n\n121\n00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,430\nAll right?\n\n122\n00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,720\nIt may just say Internet on it.\n\n123\n00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,140\nA, a lot of them do that.\n\n124\n00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,300\nBut, some of them still say WAN W-A-N,\n\n125\n00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,950\nand that's to identify that this is\nthe one that points to the outside world.\n\n126\n00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,950\nAll of the other ports you have, and\nyou might only have one other one, but\n\n127\n00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,720\nyou might have five other ones.\n\n128\n00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720\nAll of the other ports will\nbe inside ports or LAN,\n\n129\n00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,590\nLocal Area Network ports, that are\ndesigned for your computers to plug in to.\n\n130\n00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,210\nAll right.\n\n131\n00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,020\nSo we need to plug our cable modem or\nour DSL modem\n\n132\n00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,000\ninto that WAN port on the router, and\nwe need to verify that it's working.\n\n133\n00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,210\nNow the easiest way to verify basic\nconnectivity, is that when you\n\n134\n00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,040\nplug a network cable in there's a little\nlight on it called a link light and\n\n135\n00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,830\nit should light up, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,010\nIf it doesn't light up,\nthen the cable is not working.\n\n137\n00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,590\nThen it might be the wrong type of\ncable or there might be a problem,\n\n138\n00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,930\nthe cable modem or\nDSM modem might not be working.\n\n139\n00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,850\nThere's all sorts of issues\nthat can pop up there.\n\n140\n00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,557\nWe just need to verify that we see that\nlink light, that's step one, right?\n\n141\n00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,870\nStep two is to see whether your\nrouter is able to use it, and\n\n142\n00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,640\nthat's usually done right on\nthe main screen of your router.\n\n143\n00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,910\nWhen you log in to your\nrouter's interface,\n\n144\n00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,020\nit'll usually tell you whether that\ninternet connection is working.\n\n145\n00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,278\nAnd that's the first\nthing CompTIA calls out.\n\n146\n00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:21,340\nVerify wired connection if applicable and\nyour internet connection normally will be.\n\n147\n00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,090\nSo let me bring up a router interface\nhere, so I've got one pulled up.\n\n148\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,210\nThis is a Linksys WRT54G version 2 and\nit's a very, very popular access point.\n\n149\n00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,540\nA lot of people use this one.\n\n150\n00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,290\nThere was a predecessor to it,\n\n151\n00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,894\nthe WRT54G, it was like the defacto\nhome router for a, a long time.\n\n152\n00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,136\nSo, there, there's several of\nthese products that are out there.\n\n153\n00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,049\nOn this one, when I log in,\n\n154\n00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:52,307\nmy main page is actually not as\nuseful as it is on some of them.\n\n155\n00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,686\nSome of them, when you log in,\nthey take you to a status page.\n\n156\n00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:58,672\nAnd you can s,\nsee whether things are working or not.\n\n157\n00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:00,627\nAnd, and in my case, I look at it and\n\n158\n00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:04,600\nit's not giving me a status,\nthis is a configuration page.\n\n159\n00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,970\nAnd status for me is way over here,\nand so I'm gonna go into status.\n\n160\n00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,620\nAnd here's where I can take a look\nat it and find out whether or\n\n161\n00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,370\nnot my Internet connection is working,\nall right.\n\n162\n00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,540\nWhen I look at mine I see my\nlogin type is set to DHCP,\n\n163\n00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,110\nthat stands for\ndynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n164\n00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,220\nI should be getting an IP address and\n\n165\n00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,840\nother information from\nmy service provider.\n\n166\n00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,390\nI should see numbers.\n\n167\n00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,450\nRight in here, where I just see zeros.\n\n168\n00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,560\nOkay, that's a pretty good indicator right\nthere that my connection is not working,\n\n169\n00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,870\nI'm not connecting to the Internet,\nall right.\n\n170\n00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,020\nSo, I've got a problem, and I either\nneed to call the service provider and,\n\n171\n00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,170\nand work with their tech support to\nsolve it, or, you know, we could try and\n\n172\n00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,430\ndo some troubleshooting on our own,\nreplace the cable and, and so on.\n\n173\n00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,070\nWe could try and get a new DHCP address,\nbut I can see I'm not getting one.\n\n174\n00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,350\nSo I got a problem.\n\n175\n00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,630\nIf I were to hook up all my PCs to this\nrouter, they'd be able to see each other,\n\n176\n00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,260\nbut they wouldn't be able\nto get out to the Internet.\n\n177\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,870\nSo this is something we\ndefinitely need to overcome.\n\n178\n00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,450\nSo this is like step one of\nsetting up one of these routers\n\n179\n00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,180\nis to verify your Internet\nconnection is working.\n\n180\n00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,518\n>> I just thought of something.\n\n181\n00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:15,260\nYou said to get access to the router\nitself and it to bring this up.\n\n182\n00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,350\nHow I actually get to doing that?\n\n183\n00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,110\nDo I have to get some special software?,\n\n184\n00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,890\nBut I see you're doing\nit through a browser.\n\n185\n00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,870\n>> It depends, right, and\nthat's why they don't test on it,\n\n186\n00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,720\nthat is not one of our objectives because\nit is different for every router.\n\n187\n00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,400\nSome routers will have a web\npage just like this one.\n\n188\n00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,570\nAnd so in the instruction manual it'll\nsay when you turn on the router,\n\n189\n00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,200\nfire up a web browser and\ntype this into the address bar.\n\n190\n00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,340\nIt'll tell you what to type in to get to\nthis interface that I'm in right now.\n\n191\n00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,890\nOthers will have software or a CD that you\npop in and that's what will get you there.\n\n192\n00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,770\nOthers still might actually have\na full on web server that's out\n\n193\n00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,820\non the Internet that you go to and\nit does cloud management of the system.\n\n194\n00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,410\nSome of the newer Linksys do that.\n\n195\n00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,670\nSo there's a number of different ways\nthat you can gain access to them,\n\n196\n00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,960\nso you really need to check the manual for\n\n197\n00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,080\nyour equipment to find out how to\nget to the management screen for it.\n\n198\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,760\nAll right.\n\n199\n00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,680\nBut after that, most of them are the same.\n\n200\n00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,850\nThey'll usually have status, and,\n\n201\n00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,110\nand I find that status is\ntypically the homepage.\n\n202\n00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,760\nThis router is not like that.\n\n203\n00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,530\nAnd then you'll see all these other tabs\nthat we configure various other things.\n\n204\n00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,920\nThey might be arranged as buttons and\nnot tabs.\n\n205\n00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,460\nIt might be a green\nscreen instead of blue.\n\n206\n00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,620\nBut at the end of the day it's\nthe same information being displayed.\n\n207\n00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,480\nAll right.\nSo once our Internet connection is\n\n208\n00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,460\nfunctional, then there's some other\nthings that we need to take care of.\n\n209\n00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,970\nAll right?\n\n210\n00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,750\nThe second thing that CompTIA calls\nout is securing the wireless network.\n\n211\n00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,960\nAll right?\n\n212\n00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,400\nIf I jump into my wireless configuration.\n\n213\n00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,100\nAll right.\nWhen I go under Wireless,\n\n214\n00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,100\nI can see right here that my wireless\nconfiguration is set to manual.\n\n215\n00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,750\nI'm in mixed mode, and\nI've got no network ID.\n\n216\n00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,860\nSo, without that network ID being set,\nI'm running at my default.\n\n217\n00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,340\nThis router is gonna create a wireless\nnetwork that's actually called LinkSys.\n\n218\n00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,920\nIt's real easy to spot.\n\n219\n00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,280\nIf you ever see a wireless network called\nLinkSys that's somebody who didn't bother\n\n220\n00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,120\nto configure their router and you'll\nlikely be able to get into it, all right.\n\n221\n00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,530\nBut, we need to change it to\nwhatever we want that to be called.\n\n222\n00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,218\nSo maybe I want it to be called ITproTV.\n\n223\n00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,599\nTB.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,260\n>> Our new tuberculosis show.\n\n225\n00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,190\nSo, ITproTV,\nthat's what I want it to be called.\n\n226\n00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,910\nAnd now when people take\ntheir cellphone and\n\n227\n00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,790\nthey want to connect to our network, they\nsee ITproTV and they connect, all right.\n\n228\n00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,430\nSo now I made it a little more unique.\n\n229\n00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,616\nBut, the network will be open and\n\n230\n00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:28,960\nunsecure, anybody could jump on it,\nall right.\n\n231\n00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,690\nAnd that's probably not what I want.\n\n232\n00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,830\nSo wireless security is the next thing\nthat I need to set up and many routers\n\n233\n00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,760\nthese days will include the security\nsettings right here on this screen.\n\n234\n00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,330\nOn this router.\n\n235\n00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,580\nIt's just under another menu,\nwireless security.\n\n236\n00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,190\nLet me see if I can make that a little\nbit bigger so we can just see it.\n\n237\n00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,160\nThere we go.\n\n238\n00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,070\nSo I'm just gonna go right\nhere to wireless security,\n\n239\n00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,180\nand when I go into wireless security,\nI can see right now it's disabled.\n\n240\n00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,250\nIt's not securing my connection at all.\n\n241\n00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,516\n>> But it is functional still.\n\n242\n00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,040\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,770\n>> It is functional, yeah.\n\n244\n00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,170\nAnd if I drop that down,\nI'll see a lot of choices.\n\n245\n00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,390\nNow, your router may or\nmay not have all of these choices.\n\n246\n00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,010\nIt might only have one or two of them.\n\n247\n00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,030\nIt might have all these and\neven more, right?\n\n248\n00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,890\nBut there's a couple that\nwe can expect to see, and\n\n249\n00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,400\nthose are the ones that CompTIA calls out.\n\n250\n00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,840\nThe first one is WEP,\nthis guy down here at the bottom.\n\n251\n00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,910\nThat stands for\nWired Equivalency Protocol.\n\n252\n00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,230\nAll right?\n\n253\n00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,450\nAnd what they were saying,\nthis is one of the oldest, right?\n\n254\n00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,240\nSo, this is back when\nwireless was first developed.\n\n255\n00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,630\nThey said, if I have a wired computer,\na cable that I run from my computer to\n\n256\n00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,810\nanother computer, the only way somebody\ncould intercept that would be if they\n\n257\n00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,290\ntapped into the cable, and\nthat's pretty hard to do.\n\n258\n00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,230\nSo, a point to point\ncable is pretty secure.\n\n259\n00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,220\nWell, with wireless, it's not that way,\nbecause the wireless signal goes outside\n\n260\n00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,080\nyour walls, bleeds out into huge areas,\nanyone can intercept it.\n\n261\n00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,520\nSo they said, let's create a encryption\nprotocol that will encrypt our data so\n\n262\n00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,750\nit's just as secure as when\nwe go over a wired network.\n\n263\n00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,080\nAnd that was wired equivalency protocol.\n\n264\n00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,710\nThe problem is, this was in the early\ndays of wireless access points.\n\n265\n00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,340\nThis was like 1999, 2000, around there.\n\n266\n00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,150\nAnd the hardware in access\npoints were not very strong, and\n\n267\n00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,270\nso they chose a pretty weak encryption\nalgorithm, and it did not take long.\n\n268\n00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,390\nIt was less than a year before\nsomebody broke the algorithm and\n\n269\n00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,660\ntoday you can compromise a web\nnetwork in just a matter of minutes,\n\n270\n00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,858\nit does take long to break into one.\n\n271\n00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:27,470\nSo while WEP is an option for securing\na network, I don't want to use it.\n\n272\n00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,033\nIn fact on the exam, the only\nscenario where WEP is an acceptable\n\n273\n00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:35,000\nanswer Iis if nothing else is available.\n\n274\n00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,180\nIf no other option is available,\nthen you can choose WEP.\n\n275\n00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,210\nBut it does need to be your last ditch.\n\n276\n00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,250\nSome people say it's\nbetter than nothing and\n\n277\n00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,650\nI would say it's not\nmuch more than nothing.\n\n278\n00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,970\nIt's only gonna stop the lazy hackers.\n\n279\n00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,050\nAny hacker with two minutes of Google\nexperience can get into you know,\n\n280\n00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,770\ninto your,\nyour network that's secured by WEP.\n\n281\n00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,360\n>> Yeah.\nNow, it,\n\n282\n00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,300\nit's ironic that you mentioned Google or\neven YouTube.\n\n283\n00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,145\nYou go to YouTube, you see people\nbreaking the web encryption to music.\n\n284\n00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:00,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is,\n\n285\n00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,140\nit's kind of a little bit unusual,\nbut, but it does happen.\n\n286\n00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,090\nThe next protocol that we have is\nthe one that's labeled as WPA.\n\n287\n00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,440\nWPA stands for wi-fi protected access.\n\n288\n00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,060\nThe reason why WPA came along\nis because of the weaknesses\n\n289\n00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,800\nthat we found in the WEP protocol.\n\n290\n00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,560\nSo what ended up happening\nis that with the,\n\n291\n00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,430\nwith the WEP they, people kept trying\nto push the standardizing body.\n\n292\n00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,110\nThey, they'd say change it.\n\n293\n00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,900\nAnd they wouldn't change it so vendors got\ntogether and said we need a better one.\n\n294\n00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,040\nAnd they came up with their standard\nto offer us WEP at the beginning, and\n\n295\n00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,200\nit did offer a stronger type\nof encryption and a better.\n\n296\n00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,770\n>> And the WPA is better, right?\n\n297\n00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,289\nIt's got the personal and enterprise\nmodes which doesn't really drive into but\n\n298\n00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,600\npersonal mode just uses a password.\n\n299\n00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,730\nSo when you wanna connect,\nyou type in a password.\n\n300\n00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,510\nAnd that password serves\nas an encryption key and\n\n301\n00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,510\nit's a very strong form of encryption.\n\n302\n00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,840\nWell, it was, a very strong form of\nencryption, but researchers found a, a way\n\n303\n00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,980\nthat was theoretically possible to break\nit but computers weren't fast enough.\n\n304\n00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,570\nToday, computers are fast enough,\nall right?\n\n305\n00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,780\nBut back then, this is over ten years ago,\nthey said one day computers will be fast\n\n306\n00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,510\nenough, they will be able to break WPA,\nso it's not gonna last.\n\n307\n00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,390\nSo let's create something new ahead\nof time, and that's what they did and\n\n308\n00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,180\nthey created WPA2 all right.\n\n309\n00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,260\nWPA2, WiFi Protected Access 2,\nthe sequel, right?\n\n310\n00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,810\nThis time it's personal.\n\n311\n00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,730\nThe WPA2, it's just a stronger\nform of encryption, right?\n\n312\n00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,550\nSo it ratchets things up and\ngoes even stronger than WPA.\n\n313\n00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,680\nAnd gives you actual security.\n\n314\n00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,490\nSo, of the ones that are here in the list,\nWPA2 is the only one that really,\n\n315\n00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,780\ntruly secures your network.\n\n316\n00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,454\nWPA comes in second place, but\nit is breakable, it, it's hard, but\n\n317\n00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:43,340\nit is breakable.\n\n318\n00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,147\nWEP comes in third place and\nit's easily broken, so\n\n319\n00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:51,048\nit's not much better than than,\nthan nothing.\n\n320\n00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,988\nAnd then nothing, right.\n\n321\n00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:53,730\nDisabled.\n\n322\n00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,590\nThat's unsecure, and that means that\nanybody can jump on your network.\n\n323\n00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,660\nAnd not only that,\nif you're talking to the access point,\n\n324\n00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,210\nanybody else that's near you can hear\nthe communication, can see those, those\n\n325\n00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,180\npackets crossing the wireless network and\nintercept them if they want, all right.\n\n326\n00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,700\nSo we typically don't want that to happen.\n\n327\n00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,073\nNow, a lot of the things that we do,\nlike browsing the webpages, may use SSL or\n\n328\n00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:21,919\nother, other types of encryption\nto secure your communication, so\n\n329\n00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,720\nyou might still be secure even\nthough you're on this open network.\n\n330\n00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,520\nBut, you just don't know, right?\n\n331\n00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,280\nYou don't know if all of your\ncommunications are being secured.\n\n332\n00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,340\nSo, really, WPA2 is the one we want,\nwe want to choose that.\n\n333\n00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,510\nAnd when you pick it,\nit's asking me if a few questions,\n\n334\n00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,560\nlike what algorithm do I want to use,\nand you'll see two choices, all right?\n\n335\n00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,000\nWell, WPA used TKIP, right?\n\n336\n00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,848\nSo TKIP, that was the encryption\nalgorithm they used, which is weak.\n\n337\n00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:53,582\nWPA2 can do AES.\n\n338\n00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,477\nThat's the one that's strong.\n\n339\n00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:58,381\nOr it can do TKIP and AES.\n\n340\n00:16:58,381 --> 00:16:59,720\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n341\n00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,010\nThat means you're actually running WPA and\nWPA2 at the same time, and\n\n342\n00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,730\nthat was done initially as a transition\ntechnology to get people to move over.\n\n343\n00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,710\nYou do not want to stay that\nway if you can avoid it.\n\n344\n00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,700\nYou wanna get to AES.\n\n345\n00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,988\nNow if I go down to Web,\njust Web by itself,\n\n346\n00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:17,497\nit just asks how many bits I want\nto encrypt with, and that's it.\n\n347\n00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:20,140\nIt's not, you know, a particular standard.\n\n348\n00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,705\nAnd I can choose one of these.\n\n349\n00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,322\nYou can go 128 bit if you want.\n\n350\n00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:25,355\nBut even that is pretty easily broken, so\n\n351\n00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:28,616\nyou're really just making it more\nannoying to join your network.\n\n352\n00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:29,450\nAll right?\n\n353\n00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,190\nBut with all three of them you have\nthat option to type in a pass phrase,\n\n354\n00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,900\na pass code that people type in to be\nable to access the, the wireless network.\n\n355\n00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,773\nSo you punch you that in and\n\n356\n00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:41,769\nyou share it with the people\nthat are gonna use the network.\n\n357\n00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,347\nSo here's my WPA shared key and\nmy WPA2 key.\n\n358\n00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:49,970\nI punched that in and people can get\nin there and connect, all right.\n\n359\n00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,451\nSo, we need to pick an encryption\nstandard and then define a key, right?\n\n360\n00:17:55,451 --> 00:18:00,632\nSo for us we might set ours to\n\n361\n00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:04,487\nyou know, ITProTV rocks.\n\n362\n00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:05,090\nThere.\n\n363\n00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,151\nAll right.\nThat's actually\n\n364\n00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,239\nprobably an annoying password cuz you have\nto tell people what letters to capitalize,\n\n365\n00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,861\nwhat letters to lowercase, with\nthe exclamation point you know but, but\n\n366\n00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,880\nyou can type whatever you want for\nthat key.\n\n367\n00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,560\nAnd people can come along and,\nand punch that in.\n\n368\n00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,780\nAll right, so\nwe want to change our network ID, right?\n\n369\n00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,020\nAnd that network ID we saw\nback here under Basic, right?\n\n370\n00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,270\nSo that's where we change the network ID,\nthe SSID, the service set identifier.\n\n371\n00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,827\nWe want to change that, and\n\n372\n00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:34,160\nwe want to change the security\nprotocol that's used on it.\n\n373\n00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,320\nOnce those are in place, now the wireless\nportion of this router is configured.\n\n374\n00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,890\nAnd we can go to our workstations,\nour, our laptops, our tablets,\n\n375\n00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,600\nour, our smartphones, and\nyou can search for the wireless network.\n\n376\n00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,750\nAnd you'll find ITProTV, and when you go\nto connect it'll ask you for a password.\n\n377\n00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,510\nAnd you punch in that password and\ntype it in there, and\n\n378\n00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,710\nit connects, and now you're on\nthe network, and you're secure, right?\n\n379\n00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,350\nYou're encrypting your data,\nand it's safe, at least for\n\n380\n00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,813\nthe wireless leg of the journey.\n\n381\n00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:06,200\nWell, and once you get on to the rest of\nthe network it's it's up to other things.\n\n382\n00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160\nAll right, what else do we need\nto mess with here, Ronnie?\n\n383\n00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,988\nSo, we, we tackled-\n>> Firmware.\n\n384\n00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Those\n\n385\n00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,428\n>> Well we got\n\n386\n00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:13,150\nchange administrator password.\n\n387\n00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,550\n>> Okay.\n>> We haven't done that one yet.\n\n388\n00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,940\nSo, you mentioned it earlier, right?\n\n389\n00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,960\nWhen you get one of these routers,\nit's got a default username and\n\n390\n00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,215\npassword associated with it, and\nit's pretty easy to find out what that is.\n\n391\n00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:27,175\nSo, so for example,\nthis this Linksys one here.\n\n392\n00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:31,905\nIf I were to go to Linksys' website, I\ncould just go and pull the manual for it.\n\n393\n00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:36,175\nLike if somebody knew that was the router\nthat I had, they could go into Support,\n\n394\n00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,555\nthey could punch in\nthe model of the router, and\n\n395\n00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,105\nthey don't even necessarily have to know\nthe model, because if they just know it's\n\n396\n00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:46,100\nLinksys, Linksys uses the same username\nand password on all their stuff so\n\n397\n00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,130\nit's just username admin,\npassword admin, that's what they use.\n\n398\n00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,190\nBut the can go and\nfind the specific manual.\n\n399\n00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,900\nIt'll be in here somewhere.\n\n400\n00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,430\nLet's see, Guide Me, Forums, Downloads.\n\n401\n00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,380\nLet's see, do we have a manual?\n\n402\n00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,070\nThere's Setup Wizard-\n>> [CROSSTALK] User Guide.\n\n403\n00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,080\n>> So we can go into our User Guide for\nthis thing.\n\n404\n00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,100\nAnd in the user guide somewhere it'll\ntell us what that default user name and\n\n405\n00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,310\npassword is.\n\n406\n00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,990\nSo, you know, let's see if I\ncan just find it real quick.\n\n407\n00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,330\nMy default user name and password,\nit'll be in here somewhere and\n\n408\n00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,930\nthen we can just log in with it.\n\n409\n00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,390\nHere it's even coaching us and\ntelling us to go in and change that stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,280\nBut let's see-\n>> Yup, there it is.\n\n411\n00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,380\nYou got it.\n>> Oh, do I?\n\n412\n00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,880\n>> Step-\n>> Oh, here it is-\n\n413\n00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,380\n>> Number two, yeah.\n\n414\n00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,170\n>> Yup.\n\n415\n00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,790\nThe Linksys default password is admin.\n\n416\n00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,510\nSo to get logged in,\n\n417\n00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,320\nthere it is.\nSo\n\n418\n00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,060\na hacker could just download this manual,\nand\n\n419\n00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,360\nnow they know your password.\nSo you gotta change that one,\n\n420\n00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,560\nit's, it's pretty important.\nIt was easy for us to find that,\n\n421\n00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,810\nor easy for Ronnie to find it,\nI was just staring at it, like nothing.\n\n422\n00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,100\nSo so we need to change that.\n\n423\n00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,380\nAnd you'll normally find that setting\nunder a menu called Administration.\n\n424\n00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,450\nAnd it might be very easy to get at it.\n\n425\n00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,390\nIt might be stashed away.\n\n426\n00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,820\nBut, here,\nit's just right under Administration.\n\n427\n00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,570\nAnd if I go to Administration,\nright here, local router access, and\n\n428\n00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,530\nI can punch in that password.\n\n429\n00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,040\nAll right?\n\n430\n00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,150\nSo we type it in, and we get it set,\nand you're in business.\n\n431\n00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,720\nAll right?\n\n432\n00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,920\nSo just change that to something\nother than the default.\n\n433\n00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,610\nAll right, what's what's next?\n\n434\n00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,990\nThat was the admin password\nconnect to the new network.\n\n435\n00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,670\n>> Hm.\n\n436\n00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,960\n>> Once the wireless network is up,\nwe should test it out.\n\n437\n00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,040\nWe take our own laptop, and we go and\ntry and connect to the wireless.\n\n438\n00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,120\nCan we get connected?\n\n439\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,790\nIf we can't, maybe we've chosen\na bad encryption protocol,\n\n440\n00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,600\nmaybe we set the password wrong.\n\n441\n00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,490\nWe test it out, right?\n\n442\n00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,500\nYou test to make sure it's functioning.\n\n443\n00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,350\nAnd you're ready to go.\n\n444\n00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,370\nIf the wireless isn't working, you can\nalways take a laptop or a desktop and\n\n445\n00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,970\nphysically plug into a port on the back\nof the router and it may take off,\n\n446\n00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,000\nit may not, right?\n\n447\n00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,840\nBut that'll let you know whether\nwireless is the problem or\n\n448\n00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,210\nif the router itself is the problem.\n\n449\n00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n450\n00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,260\nOnce you get that wireless connection up,\nyou know that you have connectivity\n\n451\n00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,330\ninside of your network, but\nwe also want to verify by\n\n452\n00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,480\nbeing able to connect to a webpage and\nany other place on the Internet too, so\n\n453\n00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,510\nthat we know that we can connect not only\nto the router, but also through the router\n\n454\n00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,050\nout to the Internet too, so that we can\nverify everything is set up correctly.\n\n455\n00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n456\n00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,270\n>> So at that point,\nyou're up and going, right?\n\n457\n00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,420\nWe've got, we've changed the admin\npassword, we've changed the wireless name,\n\n458\n00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,160\nwe've set an encryption protocol,\nwe're connected.\n\n459\n00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,500\nWe're getting out to the Internet, right?\n\n460\n00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,198\nWired and wireless,\nwhere we're getting out.\n\n461\n00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:16,162\nWe're done.\n\n462\n00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:19,450\nWell, flaws in these routers do\noccur from time to time, right?\n\n463\n00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,310\nThere's exploits.\n\n464\n00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,040\nHackers find a way to get into them.\n\n465\n00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,590\nAnd so the vendors that create\nthe routers will release updates.\n\n466\n00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,540\nUpdates the software on the router,\nand a lot of people forget about this,\n\n467\n00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,240\nbut it's what Ronnie was talking\nabout when he said firmware.\n\n468\n00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,050\nWe need to go and\nupdate the operating system that runs on\n\n469\n00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,330\nthe router from time to time\nto keep it secure, right?\n\n470\n00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,550\nNow, how do I know if I know\nif I need to do an update?\n\n471\n00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,880\nWell, let me show you.\n\n472\n00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,836\nWhen I look at my router screen here,\nso, I'm, I'm logged in, and\n\n473\n00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:47,793\nI can see firmware version 1.5.00, right?\n\n474\n00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,185\nSo there it is,\nthat's telling me my firmware.\n\n475\n00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,300\nIf you don't see it, like, here it's\nnice because it's written at the top.\n\n476\n00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,790\nSome vendors will stick it all the way\ndown on the bottom of the page, so\n\n477\n00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,060\nit might be down there.\n\n478\n00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,600\nOther ones make you go to the status\npage to find it, so it could be buried\n\n479\n00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,321\ndifferent places, but look for\nwhere it tells you that firmware version.\n\n480\n00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:06,849\nAll right, so I'm 1.5.00.\n\n481\n00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:10,187\nThen what I can do is I can\ngo to the Linksys webpage,\n\n482\n00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:13,450\nor whoever it is that\nmanufactured your router and\n\n483\n00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,720\nyou can go into their support system and\nsee if they've posted any updates.\n\n484\n00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,773\nSo I'm gonna punch in my\nmodel number a WRT54G2.\n\n485\n00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:30,010\nHere it is, and it is asking me\nwhat I want, and I want downloads.\n\n486\n00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,850\nI wanna download new\nfirmware if it's available.\n\n487\n00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,830\nAnd it's asking me what hardware version.\n\n488\n00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,976\nNow this is, kind of, an annoying thing,\na lot of ren, hardware manufacturers do.\n\n489\n00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,839\nWhen you buy a WRT54G2,\ndepending on when you bought it,\n\n490\n00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,431\nthey might've changed the hardwares.\n\n491\n00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:45,880\nThey ran out of some components and\nhad to swap in new ones.\n\n492\n00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,537\nAnd so, on the bottom of the device,\n\n493\n00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:50,164\nthere might be a label saying\nwhat hardware version it is.\n\n494\n00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,360\nAnd that's what it's asking me.\n\n495\n00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,721\nDo I have 1.0, 1.3 or 1.5?\n\n496\n00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,069\nWell, I've got 1.5.\n\n497\n00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,010\nSo, I'll choose that one.\n\n498\n00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,728\nAll right?\n\n499\n00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,156\nNow, I can see, sure enough,\nthere's a firmware update.\n\n500\n00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:07,358\nI'm running 1.5.0, but here's 1.5.02.\n\n501\n00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,522\nRight, not a big jump,\nbut there is a jump, and\n\n502\n00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:12,680\nthere's release notes right here\nthat'll tell me what they added.\n\n503\n00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,150\nIt is important to read the release notes.\n\n504\n00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,200\nIf there's security fixes,\nyou should apply them.\n\n505\n00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,309\nIf there's just some new feature\nthat you're not going to use,\n\n506\n00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,245\nthen you might not need to apply it.\n\n507\n00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,428\nNow here in the US, I know I've had\nseveral routers where an update will come\n\n508\n00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,544\nout and I'll go and\nread it and it will say.\n\n509\n00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:34,210\nYou know, changes to license statement\nto meet compliance with Canadian\n\n510\n00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,200\ncommunications law.\n\n511\n00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,230\nAnd, while that's great if your Canadian,\n\n512\n00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,960\nif you're not Canadian,\nit doesn't make any difference.\n\n513\n00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240\nSo, you could apply the firmware, but\nyou're not gonna gain anything out of it.\n\n514\n00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,260\nSo it doesn't matter.\n\n515\n00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,770\nYou don't always have to\napply a firmware update.\n\n516\n00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,560\nThere's always a little bit of risk when\nyou apply a firmware update that something\n\n517\n00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,450\ncould happen like the power could out\nwhile it's writing that firmware.\n\n518\n00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,750\nAnd it'll effectively disable your\nrouter and you'll have to go and\n\n519\n00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,240\nreturn it if it's still under warranty.\n\n520\n00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,150\nSo, don't apply a firmware update unless\nit's actually doing something you need,\n\n521\n00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,540\nadding a feature you need,\nor patching an exploit.\n\n522\n00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,090\nSo if I take a look, a look at\nthe release notes for this one, wow,\n\n523\n00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,580\nthat is an elaborate little release note,\nisn't it?\n\n524\n00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,320\nOh, it's in different languages,\nwonderful.\n\n525\n00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,818\nLet's see,\nhopefully one of the languages is English.\n\n526\n00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:22,050\nPage 26 [LAUGH] all right,\nso, I guess I gotta agree.\n\n527\n00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,970\nThis is a strange little\nsystem they've got.\n\n528\n00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,200\nOh, and it ends up being a text file.\n\n529\n00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,150\nWonderful.\n\n530\n00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,130\nAll right, so I can look right here.\n\n531\n00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,450\nHere's this update that came out general\nnotice just telling me I need to\n\n532\n00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,988\ndisconnect stuff before I do it.\n\n533\n00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:38,730\nHere, resolved PPPOE connectivity\nissue with Bell Canada and\n\n534\n00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,720\nsomething in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n535\n00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880\nSo, if you're in Canada,\n\n536\n00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,780\nif you're using Bell Canada,\nthen this is an important update.\n\n537\n00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,673\nBut for me, I don't really need it.\n\n538\n00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,556\nRight?\nNow, there is a 1.5.01 that's out.\n\n539\n00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:54,937\nI don't have that, right?\n\n540\n00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:58,185\nAnd so, I can see with that here,\nI've got change wireless broadcast,\n\n541\n00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:01,060\nmulticast data rate from\n11 megabyte to 1 megabyte.\n\n542\n00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,290\nThat's gonna stop multitasks\nfrom overwhelming your wireless.\n\n543\n00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,810\nThat's actually a nice thing to have,\nright?\n\n544\n00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,690\nSo I, I might want that.\n\n545\n00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,360\nAnd looking here,\nupdate with the patch to fix ping issues.\n\n546\n00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,800\nThat sounds like something I need.\n\n547\n00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,870\nUpdate wireless driver,\nthis is a good one right here, you know?\n\n548\n00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,980\nThe, the, these are updates that I want.\n\n549\n00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,170\nWindows 7 support.\n\n550\n00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,030\nFixed HNAP P2 issues.\n\n551\n00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,180\nSo, that really fixed some stuff.\n\n552\n00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,360\nNow, I didn't have the option\nto download 1.5.01, but\n\n553\n00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,230\nI know there's stuff in it that I need.\n\n554\n00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,500\nWell, 1.5.02 will include\nthose other changes.\n\n555\n00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,060\nSo, even though I'm not worried\nabout this Bell Canada stuff,\n\n556\n00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,330\nit's I'll still do it because it's\ngonna include these other fixes.\n\n557\n00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,120\nAnd here's the initial release,\nthat's what I was running.\n\n558\n00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,430\nSo this is a good firmware for me to get.\n\n559\n00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,870\nSo I can go back here and\nI can download the file, so\n\n560\n00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,900\nI' ll just download that to my system,\nit's got a nice, long firmware name.\n\n561\n00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,630\nAnd to apply it, once it's downloaded,\n\n562\n00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,820\nyou just go back to your router and it'll\nusually be under an administration menu,\n\n563\n00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,510\nbut you might under a different menu like\na trouble shooting menu or something.\n\n564\n00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,830\nBut if I go under Administration,\nI'll see right under here,\n\n565\n00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,420\na menu called Firmware Upgrade and\nI can browse and pick that file.\n\n566\n00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,320\nAnd then it'll upload to the router.\n\n567\n00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,082\nNow, there's big warnings here,\n\n568\n00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:17,460\nyou know, don't mess with\nthe router while its updating.\n\n569\n00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,590\nIt's writing to memory\nthat's already full, so\n\n570\n00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,550\nits gotta erase the memory which\nmeans it erases its operating system.\n\n571\n00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,280\nAnd it's rewriting the new one.\n\n572\n00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,240\nAnd during that time,\n\n573\n00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,350\nif your router looses power or reboots,\nit will have no operating system.\n\n574\n00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,150\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n575\n00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,270\nyou can't recover from that, so,\nyou've gotta be careful with that.\n\n576\n00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,396\nBut you would just pick the file,\nwhich that one had a crazy name.\n\n577\n00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:42,226\nI'll have to find it in my massive\npile of, of files that I've download,\n\n578\n00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,387\nI've already forgotten what the name was.\n\n579\n00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:45,886\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not gonna help me.\n\n580\n00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:51,156\nAll right, well, we would [LAUGH]\ngo in and find that file FW_WRT.\n\n581\n00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:52,810\nYou know, why did I not see that?\n\n582\n00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,850\nWell, I don't wanna waste\nall day looking for\n\n583\n00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,240\nit, but it says it should be right there.\n\n584\n00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,650\nI must have saved it to\na different folder by accident.\n\n585\n00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,730\nBut but anyhow, y, y, you just go and\nyou find it and then you hit Upgrade.\n\n586\n00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,180\nAnd it'll copy it into the router.\n\n587\n00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,620\nIt'll take a little bit of time, right?\n\n588\n00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,345\nThis, this white box here is actually\na bars that'll slowly crawl across.\n\n589\n00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,325\nAnd when it's done,\nthe router will reboot.\n\n590\n00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:20,213\nAnd you should be able to log in and\nsee the new firmware version up here,\n\n591\n00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:23,244\n1.5.02, and now you're good to go.\n\n592\n00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:23,801\nRight?\n\n593\n00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,930\nThe only problem here is that\nthe vendor doesn't reach out and\n\n594\n00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,370\ntell you when there's an update, right?\n\n595\n00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,630\nSo you just have to know to go and\nperiodically check.\n\n596\n00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,440\nGo to Linksys' website, or, or\nNetgear, or Belkin, or Buffalo, or\n\n597\n00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,330\nwhoever it is that you\nbought your router through.\n\n598\n00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,800\nGo check their website and\nsee if there're updates available.\n\n599\n00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,271\nA lot of times,\nthey have some neat features, so.\n\n600\n00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,735\nAll right Ronnie, can you think\nof anything else that we would do\n\n601\n00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:49,556\non our wireless routers to\n>> Not that, taking a look at the list,\n\n602\n00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:50,771\nlooks like we covered everything.\n\n603\n00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,535\n>> Yep, those are the basic steps.\n\n604\n00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:56,693\nKeep in mind, there is a lot more you can\ndo with these wireless routers but, for\n\n605\n00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,600\nthe CompTIA IT Fundamentals exam,\nthose are the main ones we need.\n\n606\n00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,050\nAnd, you basically configure what,\nwhat your organization needs.\n\n607\n00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,820\nJust key things to remember for\nthe exam, WPA2,\n\n608\n00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,585\nthat's really the encryption\nthat you wanna use.\n\n609\n00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:14,050\nBut remember all three,\nWPA is the weakest, W, I mean WEP,\n\n610\n00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:19,800\nWEP is the weakest, WPA is in the middle,\nand WPA2 is the strongest.\n\n611\n00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440\nSo, anytime you have a choice,\ngo with the strongest one.\n\n612\n00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,300\nAll right, well,\nthat wraps up objective objective 4.1.\n\n613\n00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,070\nSo, we're going to go ahead and and\nwrap up our episode right there.\n\n614\n00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,483\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more episodes coming up.\n\n615\n00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:37,494\nWe've gotta get into 4.2 which is\nour compare and contrast cellular,\n\n616\n00:29:37,494 --> 00:29:39,520\nwireless and wired data connections.\n\n617\n00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,322\nSo, that'll be an exciting episode, and\nremember, if you have any questions,\n\n618\n00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:45,890\nalways feel free to ask.\n\n619\n00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,900\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n620\n00:29:48,900 -->

right.\nGood morning, good afternoon and\n\n5\n00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,390\ngood evening and welcome back.\n\n6\n00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,040\nTo another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,770\nback again with Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,500\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,640\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,300\nWe are,\nare jumping into IT fundamentals again.\n\n11\n00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,400\nWe're about talk about some wireless\ntechnologies, specifically.\n\n12\n00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,050\n>> Yeah, you know, when you go\nto set up a network these days,\n\n13\n00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,550\nyou've got a lot of choices.\n\n14\n00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,590\nAnd especially when you're going out and,\nand picking some kind of internet service.\n\n15\n00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,980\nSo when you build a network, you've gotta\nunderstand what the different types are,\n\n16\n00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,780\nand, and when each is appropriate.\n\n17\n00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,310\nAnd the three main ones that we're gonna\nlook at here are all called out in\n\n18\n00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,240\nobjective 4.2.\n\n19\n00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,860\nThe, the full objective is,\ncompare and contrast cellular,\n\n20\n00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,610\nwireless and\nwired data connections, all right?\n\n21\n00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,720\nWhen you go and, and look to buy an\ninternet connection, there's a, a number\n\n22\n00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,620\nof different options that you can get, and\neven when you set up your own network,\n\n23\n00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,390\nthere's a number of\noptions that you can get.\n\n24\n00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,730\nSo you might be tempted to\nset up a wired network.\n\n25\n00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,290\nAnd a wired network,\nthat's where you just have your computers.\n\n26\n00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,710\nAnd there's a physical cable that you\nplug into the side of the computer.\n\n27\n00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,180\nAnd it runs into your network.\n\n28\n00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,880\nSo everybody has a physical cable, and\nthat's what we're doing right here,\n\n29\n00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,510\nright, Ronnie?\n\n30\n00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,000\n>> Yep.\n>> So I don't know if you guys can see\n\n31\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500\nlike here on the podium in\nbetween our computers, we have\n\n32\n00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,290\ncables that are run right up through the\npodium so we've got a physical connection.\n\n33\n00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:54,990\n>> We also have the wireless connections\ntoo where it requires a wireless\n\n34\n00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,130\naccess point.\n\n35\n00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,850\nAnd we have to have wireless network\nadapters on the individual machines, so\n\n36\n00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,240\nthey connect over using radio\nfrequency instead, and so\n\n37\n00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,810\nthat's another option that we have.\n\n38\n00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,360\n>> And almost every laptop today\nhas wireless built into it.\n\n39\n00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,220\nIn fact I'd feel cheated if I get\na laptop that didn't have it.\n\n40\n00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,390\nIt's almost as important\nas a keyboard these days.\n\n41\n00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,700\nSo wireless is very readily available and,\nand it's there.\n\n42\n00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340\nNow the third type of a connection\nis a cellular connection.\n\n43\n00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,010\nAnd we're talking about cellular\ntelephones or, or, or cell phones.\n\n44\n00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,492\nYou know, you'll have various cell phone\nproviders in your area, AT&T, Bell South,\n\n45\n00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:32,440\nO2, you know,\nwhoever it is that is in your area, and\n\n46\n00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,780\nthose guys are providing\na different type of wireless.\n\n47\n00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,949\nWhen we say wireless in our home,\nwe're talking about the 802.11 standards.\n\n48\n00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,200\nIt's 802.11 A, B, G, N, AC.\n\n49\n00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,260\nThere's a bunch of them.\n\n50\n00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,310\nBut those are access points that you can\ngo and you can just buy at the store.\n\n51\n00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,870\nBut the wireless networks the cell phone\nguys are using are far more powerful.\n\n52\n00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,230\nTheir antennas will cover\nmany miles of range, and\n\n53\n00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,890\nthey have to be regulated\nby governmental agencies.\n\n54\n00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,210\nYou know,\nthey generate high frequency traffic.\n\n55\n00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,290\nThey can interfere with other systems,\nso it's all measured, and registered and\n\n56\n00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,730\ncontrolled versus the wireless\naccess points you set up at home,\n\n57\n00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,140\nthat anybody can bring up with out\neven knowing who the FCC is, right?\n\n58\n00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,800\nWe don't even have to worry about that.\n\n59\n00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,720\nSo, it's a different type of wireless.\n\n60\n00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,240\nAnd it's typically used with cell phones.\n\n61\n00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,870\nSo, when we go to pick which connection\nis going to be appropriate for us,\n\n62\n00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,560\nhow do we, how do we know the difference?\n\n63\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,550\nHow do we know when one\nis better than another?\n\n64\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,620\nRight here on the podium,\n\n65\n00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,150\nrunning both of our laptops have\ngreat wireless cards built into them.\n\n66\n00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,710\nI think does yours do AC?\n\n67\n00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,280\n>> It does not.\n\n68\n00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,502\n>> Does not, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,990\nI don't think mine does either.\n\n70\n00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,900\nSo we don't have A02.11AC\nwhich is the fastest,\n\n71\n00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,940\nbut we've got A02.11N\nwhich is pretty darn fast.\n\n72\n00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,770\nBut we're not using the wireless up here.\n\n73\n00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,470\nWe've got physical cables.\n\n74\n00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,630\nWhy, why is that?\n\n75\n00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,870\nWhy, why would we prefer physical when,\nwhen we could be wireless?\n\n76\n00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,990\n>> Yeah, the wired connections normally\noffer us the greatest reliability and\n\n77\n00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,510\nthe greatest throughput.\n\n78\n00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,480\nTwo, because we're directly connected in,\nand we're not interfering with\n\n79\n00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,360\nanybody else trying to connect\ninto a single access point.\n\n80\n00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,730\nWe're all trying to connect\ninto one access point.\n\n81\n00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,590\nWe're each individually just taking\nour turn in that connection.\n\n82\n00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,360\nWhereas being wired in, we each have our\nown port that we're connecting in through\n\n83\n00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,540\nour own cables and\nthat gives us more bandwidth and\n\n84\n00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,855\ngreater reliability because\nit is a physical connection.\n\n85\n00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:24,350\n>> Yeah, and as nice as wireless\nnetworks are and they've gotten a lot\n\n86\n00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,485\nfaster over the years, they're still\nnot as fast as wired networks.\n\n87\n00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,230\nSo you can go faster.\n\n88\n00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,740\nSo the cool thing with a wired network\nis you have a reliable connection.\n\n89\n00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,250\nWhen you plug in it's on and\nyou have access to that interface.\n\n90\n00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,970\nWith a wireless connection,\nthe further away from the antenna you are,\n\n91\n00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,930\nthe weaker your signal gets.\n\n92\n00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,570\nAnd you're competing for\n\n93\n00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,480\naccess to that antenna with the other\npeople that are on that network.\n\n94\n00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,095\nAnd walls and metal cabinets, and things\nthat can deflect the signal, making it\n\n95\n00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:58,045\nweaker, or even intermittent sometimes, if\nyou're on the edge of a wireless network,\n\n96\n00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,965\nI'm sure everybody's seen that before.\n\n97\n00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,865\nI, I, it seems like I always\nget that with hotels.\n\n98\n00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:05,077\nYou go and stay at a hotel, and the access\npoint is somewhere where my hotel room\n\n99\n00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:08,777\ngets the signal and loses it very,\nvery rapidly is always frustrating.\n\n100\n00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:13,231\nSo, wireless networks are nice\nbecause you get mobility, right?\n\n101\n00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,734\nAnd that's the first one that,\nthat CompTIA calls out is mobility.\n\n102\n00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,824\nWith a wireless network,\nyou can move around, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:24,387\nNow with a cellular network,\nyou can move around a lot.\n\n104\n00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:27,750\nYou can move for miles and\nbe on the same tower.\n\n105\n00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,350\nAnd if you go even further,\nyou'll just jump to the next tower.\n\n106\n00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,180\nSo you can drive 100 miles\non the interstate and\n\n107\n00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,410\nstay on your phone that whole time\njumping tower to tower to tower.\n\n108\n00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,400\nThat's high mobility.\n\n109\n00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,360\nOn my wired network I can only go\nas far as this cable and I've got,\n\n110\n00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,500\nwhat do we have, Ronnie,\nlike a foot and a half.\n\n111\n00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Of extra cable here.\n\n112\n00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,390\nSo we're not moving very far, right?\n\n113\n00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,600\nWe are, we're tethered in.\n\n114\n00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,350\nOn a wireless network,\nwell their line of sight.\n\n115\n00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,040\nIf you have an access point set up and\nyou've got line of sight to it, you should\n\n116\n00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,940\nbe able to get about 300 feet away from\nthat access point for most of them.\n\n117\n00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,510\nBut it's rare that you have line of sight.\n\n118\n00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,350\nYou know, we've got an access point,\nnot but maybe 60 feet that direction, but\n\n119\n00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,610\nthe wall of our set is in between it.\n\n120\n00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,640\nAnd that wall degrades\nthe signal quite a bit.\n\n121\n00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,720\nAnd, and\nthat's what happens with wireless.\n\n122\n00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,391\nSo, you get decent mobility, but\n\n123\n00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,550\nit, it's measured in feet versus cellular\nnetworks where it's measured in miles.\n\n124\n00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,620\nSo that's the, the difference.\n\n125\n00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,090\nIf you're looking for\nhigh mobility, you go cellular.\n\n126\n00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,270\nIf you don't care about mobility,\nthen the others start to factor in.\n\n127\n00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n128\n00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,990\nSometimes, though,\nyou just need to move around the office.\n\n129\n00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,750\nWell, you don't wanna stay\nconnected in with a wire.\n\n130\n00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,780\nYou're probably gonna chose a wireless\nconnection, which is gonna give you\n\n131\n00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,430\nlimited mobility but\nprobably still decent reliability there,\n\n132\n00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,460\ntoo, depending on how many\ndevices are connecting it.\n\n133\n00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,780\n>> Now, let's talk about availability,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,660\nAvailability means is it running when\nyou want it to be running, right?\n\n135\n00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,670\nI wanna use the network right now,\nis it working?\n\n136\n00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,410\nWell on a wired network,\nit's just a physical cable.\n\n137\n00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,657\nAs long as the cable's\nplugged in it works, right?\n\n138\n00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:03,120\nIt, it's up and it's going.\n\n139\n00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,190\nThere's not a lot that can happen there,\n\n140\n00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,430\nso you get the highest availability\nwith a wired connection.\n\n141\n00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,490\nWith wireless, there's things that\ncan interfere with that connection.\n\n142\n00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,910\nYou could have a new neighbor move into\nthe neighborhood and set their wireless\n\n143\n00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,330\naccess point up on the same channel\nas yours, and they start to conflict.\n\n144\n00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,435\nAnd now when you go to jump on the\nwireless, you're getting a weaker signal.\n\n145\n00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:26,260\nAnd so it's not available,\nyou don't connect, right?\n\n146\n00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,850\nCellular networks have\nsimilar problems with that.\n\n147\n00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,560\nWhen you're near the tower,\nwith you're in a, within a mile or\n\n148\n00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,800\ntwo of a tower, you'll get a great signal.\n\n149\n00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,800\nBut then as you drive down the road there,\nthere's usually some dead area and\n\n150\n00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,560\nI know for me the way I drive to work,\nso I live seven miles away and\n\n151\n00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,450\nat about mile number two I pass\nin front of this school and\n\n152\n00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,330\nI get no cell phone reception\nin front of that school.\n\n153\n00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,750\nI, I don't know why it's just\na dead zone and so that happens.\n\n154\n00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,500\nThey can't cover everywhere\nwith their towers.\n\n155\n00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,079\nSo if you want the highest availability,\n\n156\n00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,958\na physical wired connection\nis what you want.\n\n157\n00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,920\nAnd that's what we got right\nup here in our podium.\n\n158\n00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,190\nThat's what we want during this show.\n\n159\n00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,990\nI don't want my screen\nshare to die because\n\n160\n00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,100\nmy wireless network flaked out or\nwhatever.\n\n161\n00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,270\nAlright?\n\n162\n00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,630\n>> Yea.\nSame thing can be said for\n\n163\n00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,200\nwhat we call bandwidth or throughput too.\n\n164\n00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,030\nWith bandwidth or throughput,\nthe wired connection is going to give us\n\n165\n00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,970\nthe greatest bandwidth or\nthroughput that we're ever gonna need- or\n\n166\n00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,030\nwant, I should say- for now,\ncompared to the wireless.\n\n167\n00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,730\nNow, with wireless the newer standards\nthat are coming out, we're staring to push\n\n168\n00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,260\nthat range, even with LTE and, and the AC\nstandard where they're saying, look,\n\n169\n00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,350\nit's gonna give us as much throughput as\never, but right now it's gonna be wired.\n\n170\n00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,610\n>> Now, to me, it doesn't matter.\n\n171\n00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,990\nLike, no matter how fast these\nwireless connections get.\n\n172\n00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,440\nLet's say that I'm on a gigabit\nnetwork here in the studio.\n\n173\n00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,830\nSo that I have a gig connect-.\n\n174\n00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,990\nActually, I do have a gig connection.\n\n175\n00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,500\n>> You do.\n>> Don't I?\n\n176\n00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,006\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:50,514\n>> So it's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n178\n00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,770\nSo, let's say that the 802911AC gets\n\n179\n00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,040\nupdated, and they can do gigabit over\nwireless, and it become consumer ready.\n\n180\n00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,740\nSo now it's the same speed right.\n\n181\n00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,340\nSo they're both gig lets go wireless.\n\n182\n00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,080\nEven though they've matched the speed\nyou're still sharing an antenna.\n\n183\n00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,600\nYour access point, the wireless\naccess point has antennas on it and\n\n184\n00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,180\nonly one person can talk\nto an antenna at a time.\n\n185\n00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,250\nAnd so if there's ten people they're\ntaking turns hitting that antenna.\n\n186\n00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,420\nSo sure you've got a gigabit of bandwidth.\n\n187\n00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,480\nBut not all the time.\n\n188\n00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,277\nIt's when somebody else isn't using it.\n\n189\n00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:26,210\nAnd some of the routers try to\nfix that by adding antennas.\n\n190\n00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,990\nI've seen ones with like six antennas on.\n\n191\n00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,690\nThey go crazy.\n\n192\n00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,200\nAnd it's trying to add more antennas for\npeople to be able to talk to.\n\n193\n00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,070\nBut most of them are gonna work on what's\ncalled the, first in, first out principle.\n\n194\n00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,240\nSo, whoever gets there first\ngets access to the antenna.\n\n195\n00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,620\nEverybody else has to wait.\n\n196\n00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,050\nAnd they take turns from that point.\n\n197\n00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,590\nSo even though they might be the same\nspeed you still get better through put and\n\n198\n00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,060\nbandwidth on a wired\nconnection than wireless.\n\n199\n00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,560\nBut you lose that mobility.\n\n200\n00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,910\nAnd that's a big deal so\nI know for me at home,\n\n201\n00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,870\nwhen it's my laptop I'll do wireless\njust so I can be on the couch or\n\n202\n00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,010\nin my office or wherever and\nI don't have to worry about the cable, but\n\n203\n00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,190\nwhen I'm streaming video,\nwhen I want that highest quality,\n\n204\n00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,240\nwhen I've got HD video traffic going\nacross my network, I run cables.\n\n205\n00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,400\nSo climbed up in the attic and\n\n206\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,480\nran cables to where my TVs are because\nI wanted a wired connection.\n\n207\n00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,210\nFor those Rokus or media centers or\nwhatever other devices I have.\n\n208\n00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:23,670\nAlright now, the last one that\ncomptia calls out is reliability.\n\n209\n00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,530\nNow, that's an interesting one,\ncuz we had availability, and\n\n210\n00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,160\nthat kinda sounds the same.\n\n211\n00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,590\nWell, reliability doesn't pertain\nto whether the line is up or not.\n\n212\n00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,340\nAvailability says is this line up and\nfunctioning.\n\n213\n00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,500\nReliability says yeah, it's up, but\n\n214\n00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,840\nif I send my data across it,\nwill it get through intact?\n\n215\n00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,560\nAm I going to have corruption or\n\n216\n00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,100\ninterference with the data\nthat I send across it?\n\n217\n00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,380\nIt happens, networks do that.\n\n218\n00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,450\nSo, every network technology has an error\ncorrection mechanism put in place.\n\n219\n00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,100\nIf your packet gets damaged as it crosses\nthe network it just resends it again.\n\n220\n00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,570\nBut that means it's taking two packets\nto send what should of been done in one.\n\n221\n00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,990\nSo you don't want that to\nhappen if you can avoid it.\n\n222\n00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,140\nOn a wired network, there's things\nthat can cause interference.\n\n223\n00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,850\nIf you were on a wired network\na cable over like a flourescent light,\n\n224\n00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,080\nThat will create some\ninterference in the cable, and\n\n225\n00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,630\nunless that cable is shielded\nit's going to effect your data.\n\n226\n00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,850\nYou're not going to get clean\ndata moving through that cable.\n\n227\n00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,400\nOn a wireless network, there are all sorts\nof things that can interfere with it from\n\n228\n00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,870\nMicrowaves to wireless or cordless phones.\n\n229\n00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,190\nThere's all sorts of stuff that can\ninterfere with wireless technologies.\n\n230\n00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,130\nAnd that's why, when you buy a wireless\naccess point, they'll tell you, hey.\n\n231\n00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,650\nThis one is 2.4 gigahertz,\nor this one's 5 gigahertz.\n\n232\n00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,320\nThey want you to know that frequency so\nyou can think about\n\n233\n00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,100\nthe other appliances in your house and\nwhat frequency they run on.\n\n234\n00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,800\nI know, when we had our first sons,\nI, I have two sons and\n\n235\n00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,260\nwhen we had our first son,\nwe wanted to get a baby monitor.\n\n236\n00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,860\nI knew I was in for trouble here because\nwe had these 2.4 giga-hertz access points,\n\n237\n00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,390\nand most of the baby monitors\nwere 2.4 giga-hertz also.\n\n238\n00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,980\nSo they were going to interfere.\n\n239\n00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,350\nSo I specifically sought out\nones that were 900 megahertz.\n\n240\n00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,080\nI knew I wasn't pushing anything but\na little bit of sound, and\n\n241\n00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,570\nI avoided the interference.\n\n242\n00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,540\nSo you have to plan for that stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,610\nIt's not as reliable\nas a wired connection.\n\n244\n00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,010\nAnd cellular, well, cellular depends.\n\n245\n00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,520\nThey've really come a long way, you know.\n\n246\n00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,045\nI'm sure you remember, Ronnie, like the,\nthe, the amount of dropped calls we got\n\n247\n00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,860\nten years ago versus today,\nit's, it's a different world.\n\n248\n00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n249\n00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,670\nWith the cellular connection,\nit again depends on the space and\n\n250\n00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,450\nthe number of towers that\nare actually in your area and,\n\n251\n00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,770\nof course, also geography plays into it,\nand so many other factors too.\n\n252\n00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,250\nWhere, where I lived up until\njust about six months ago,\n\n253\n00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,155\nI couldn't even get cellular signal very,\nvery easily.\n\n254\n00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:46,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So when I went inside my house,\n\n255\n00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,400\nI didn't have any.\n\n256\n00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,790\nWhen I went outside, I had one bar.\n\n257\n00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,340\nAbout six months ago,\nsomewhere along the line\n\n258\n00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,430\nthe service provider put up more antennas\non the towers that were around, and\n\n259\n00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,020\nnow I'm,\nI'm very happy with my cellular service.\n\n260\n00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,590\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n261\n00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,440\nYeah.\n\n262\n00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,100\n>> All right, so\n>> So,\n\n263\n00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,900\nthose are all things we need to keep in\nmind as we select our service, right?\n\n264\n00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,660\nSo, in, in my opinion, if you go wired,\nyou get the best reliability,\n\n265\n00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,060\nthe best bandwidth and throughput.\n\n266\n00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,230\nThe best availability.\n\n267\n00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,770\nI mean, it, it's.\n\n268\n00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> Winning on\n\n269\n00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,280\nthree out of the four categories here,\nyou'd always wanna go wired, right?\n\n270\n00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,240\nBut it gives you next to zero mobility.\n\n271\n00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,640\nSo if you want mobility you gotta look\nat the other two and then, you know,\n\n272\n00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800\nyou kinda go through your debate there.\n\n273\n00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,050\nSo there is a time and a place for\neach one of these technologies, and\n\n274\n00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,870\noften times you'll find that you\nuse a mixture of them, right.\n\n275\n00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,950\nOn my cell phone,\nI can do wireless and cellular.\n\n276\n00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,260\nSo when I'm at home or here at the office,\nI use the wireless here so\n\n277\n00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,510\nthat I'm not consuming\nmy cellular data plan.\n\n278\n00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,750\nBut when I'm on the road,\nI use the cellular data, because that's,\n\n279\n00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,200\nthat's what's available,\nthe only choice I have, right.\n\n280\n00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,950\nSo you have to pick and choose based\non what you have access to All right.\n\n281\n00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,050\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\nthis is a very easily testable thing.\n\n282\n00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,390\nI want to show you guys an example.\n\n283\n00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,750\nI'm going to take my laptop and\n\n284\n00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,060\nI'm going to transition it\nbetween three different networks.\n\n285\n00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,910\nI'm going to go between wired,\nwireless and cellular.\n\n286\n00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,860\nAnd, I want to show you guys\na difference that happens with the delay\n\n287\n00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,100\non the connection.\n\n288\n00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,290\nAnd, delay, we, we measure that,\nsome people call it lag.\n\n289\n00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,830\nHow long wou, it take, takes data to\nget to a destination across a line.\n\n290\n00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,590\nAnd you can measure that\nwith a utility called ping.\n\n291\n00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,130\nIt's a very simple utility.\n\n292\n00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,390\nAnd so, I'm gonna move my laptop through\neach of these three networks, and\n\n293\n00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,900\nyou'll see how that changes.\n\n294\n00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,530\nAlright?\n\n295\n00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,970\nLet's start, I, I've got my,\nmy laptop here and.\n\n296\n00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,180\nI'm on a wired network, right now, so\nI am wired in on my gigabit connection.\n\n297\n00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,730\nAll right?\n\n298\n00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,300\nBut I'm just doing pings,\nwhich are very, very small.\n\n299\n00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,590\nSo, it doesn't matter if this\nis a one megabit network, or\n\n300\n00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,420\na ten meg, gigabit network, or whatever.\n\n301\n00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,950\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n302\n00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,830\nI'm going to be sending about I\nthink I'm going to send about 64\n\n303\n00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,420\nnot a huge amount of data that\nI'll be sending on the network so\n\n304\n00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,180\nbandwidth is not going\nto factor into this.\n\n305\n00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,890\nThis is purely going\nto be measuring delay.\n\n306\n00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,790\nAlright, so\nif I do a ping out to 4.2.2.1 that is\n\n307\n00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,750\na public DNS server out there on the\ninternet and is operated by level three?\n\n308\n00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,340\nWho has that now?\n\n309\n00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,100\nIt was GTE back in the day but\nI think it's level three now.\n\n310\n00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,720\nBut I'm going to ping out to it.\n\n311\n00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,660\nAnd if you look at my numbers,\nlet me let it run here for\n\n312\n00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,130\na sec cuz what you get\nis a kind of average.\n\n313\n00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,270\nAnd if you look at my numbers, it looks\nlike my average as I did that ping,\n\n314\n00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,800\nwas, oh, I had that outlier.\n\n315\n00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,333\nSometimes you get an outlier like\nthis that's throwing off my numbers.\n\n316\n00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,440\nBut just kinda glancing at it here,\nit looks like 24 to 25 milliseconds is\n\n317\n00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,990\nthe average of, of what it took for\nmy packets to make it out there.\n\n318\n00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,333\nYou'll see where most of them were\nkinda falling in that range, right?\n\n319\n00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,605\nSo so that's kinda the,\nthe number I can expect on my\n\n320\n00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:59,417\nwire [INAUDIBLE] 24 to 25\nmilliseconds to reach out to there.\n\n321\n00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,917\nAnd, and that server I,\nI believe is on the west coast.\n\n322\n00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,560\nSo it's on the other side of the country.\n\n323\n00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,430\nBut but that's what I'm getting.\n\n324\n00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,620\nAll right?\n\n325\n00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,170\nIf I switch over to my wireless network.\n\n326\n00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,828\nAll right?\nNow the wireless network here,\n\n327\n00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:12,669\nthe access point is on\nthe other side of this room.\n\n328\n00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,240\nI can, I can almost see it from here,\nso it's not very far away.\n\n329\n00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,130\nWhen I hit that wireless access point, I'm\ngonna go to the exact same switch that I\n\n330\n00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,560\njust went to, and to the same router,\nand out to the same internet connection.\n\n331\n00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,490\nSo, everything is the same, except I'm\nmoving from the cable on my laptop,\n\n332\n00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,640\nover to the access point that's\noff camera here, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,280\nSo that's the only thing that's gonna\nchange when I move between the two.\n\n334\n00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,809\nSo let me let me just wipe\nout this route real quick.\n\n335\n00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,581\nThere we go.\n\n336\n00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:47,780\nAnd so now when I send this I'm\ngonna go over that wireless network.\n\n337\n00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,595\nAll right.\nSo I'm gonna let that run for a moment,\n\n338\n00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:52,934\nand I've got some numbers that are kinda\nbouncing around a bit, and I see,\n\n339\n00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:56,600\nyou know, some, some numbers that are kind\nof all over the place, aren't they?\n\n340\n00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,260\nAll right, well let's stop there.\n\n341\n00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,895\nI did see some good numbers.\n\n342\n00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,261\nSometimes I got 23, 22, which actually\nis a little bit better than my wired\n\n343\n00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:09,776\nconnection, but it looks like more often\nI got higher numbers like 34 and 39.\n\n344\n00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:12,066\nI see a lot of those kinda\nspread throughout here.\n\n345\n00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,830\n151, but we'll just throw that one out.\n\n346\n00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,810\nSo, overall it looks like my average was a\nlittle bit higher on this one if you take\n\n347\n00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,630\nout that, that kind of deviation or\nwhatever that was there.\n\n348\n00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,884\nSo so we can see that it actually\ntook you a little bit longer.\n\n349\n00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,125\nNot much longer, right?\n\n350\n00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,148\nI was doing 24 to 25 milliseconds on\nthe other one, this one it looks like I'm\n\n351\n00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:35,780\ncloser to 30 milliseconds as my,\nmy norm, maybe a little higher.\n\n352\n00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,252\nThey're not much greater, right?\n\n353\n00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,480\nJust a handful of milliseconds.\n\n354\n00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,750\nBut the reason is,\ngoing over the wireless like that,\n\n355\n00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,390\nwell, it creates a little bit of lag.\n\n356\n00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,620\nIt creates a little delay that you don't\nnecessarily have with the wireless, or\n\n357\n00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,960\nwired connection.\n\n358\n00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,430\nNow where we really see that creep up,\nis where we switch over to cellular.\n\n359\n00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,590\nWhen I jump over to a cellular network,\nwhich,\n\n360\n00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,170\nlet me, let me do that real\nquick while I'm talking here.\n\n361\n00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,760\nWhen we switch over to a cellular network,\n\n362\n00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,780\nI'm actually having to jump all the way\nover to the nearest cell tower.\n\n363\n00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,680\nAnd the nearest cell tower for\nus is actually like, it is,\n\n364\n00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,300\nI think it's like just under\ntwo miles in that direction.\n\n365\n00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,805\nSo it's a good bit away from where I'm at.\n\n366\n00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:23,067\nSo my signal is gonna have to travel\ntwo miles, before it hits the antenna.\n\n367\n00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,380\nThis is gonna send me out to the internet.\n\n368\n00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,973\nAnd so, that's gonna cause quite\na quite a delay in my connection,\n\n369\n00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:33,647\nand we'll see that very quickly.\n\n370\n00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:37,479\nSo while I'm actually able to connect, I'm\nable to get out to the internet and work,\n\n371\n00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:41,660\nmy connection may seem fast, there's this\ndelay that's happening in the background.\n\n372\n00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,108\nSo, let me see if I can\nconnect to my phone.\n\n373\n00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:48,090\nI'm just gonna tether it through\nmy cell phone if it will show up.\n\n374\n00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,510\nIt says that I'm discoverable,\nbut my Mac here is not.\n\n375\n00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,640\nOh, there it is, Don's iPhone.\n\n376\n00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,575\nAll right.\nSo let me jump on that real quick and\n\n377\n00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,033\ngive that a second to connect.\n\n378\n00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:00,880\nAll right.\n\n379\n00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,645\nSo now that I'm connected on that one,\nI'll just do that same ping, and\n\n380\n00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,340\nhere we go.\n\n381\n00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,613\nNow I'm on AT&T's network and\nI'm traveling to that cell tower.\n\n382\n00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,346\nLook at those numbers, right?\n\n383\n00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,562\nThose are some, oop, well oh,\nit's picking up a bit.\n\n384\n00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,410\nMaybe it just took a second\nto get in their slides.\n\n385\n00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,493\nWoop, we wanna be fair, right?\n\n386\n00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,194\nWe'll give it a little bit more time.\n\n387\n00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:19,039\nBut there we go.\n\n388\n00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,959\nOn average, you know, we did have once,\nwhen it was under 100\n\n389\n00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:28,810\nmilliseconds, but\nmost of these were over 100 milligrams.\n\n390\n00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,520\nSome of them were 300 milliseconds.\n\n391\n00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,396\nThese are higher numbers.\n\n392\n00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:33,021\nLike, I'll throw out some\nof these higher ones.\n\n393\n00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:33,880\nLike 744.\n\n394\n00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,797\nThat, that's probably an outlier.\n\n395\n00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,458\nBut but a lot of these are,\nare definitely over 100.\n\n396\n00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,419\nActually, they're,\nthey're all over 100 except for one.\n\n397\n00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,149\nThat is quite a bit more delay than\nwhat I had over my, my wired or\n\n398\n00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,022\neven my local wireless connections.\n\n399\n00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:47,630\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n400\n00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,578\nit's just because of the distance that you\nhave to travel to fly across the air to\n\n401\n00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:51,155\nthat antenna.\n\n402\n00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,316\nIt's, it's very quick, right?\n\n403\n00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,103\nBut it does take time.\n\n404\n00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:57,260\nSo, that factors into our connections.\n\n405\n00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,790\nNo matter how much bandwidth or\navailability or\n\n406\n00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,170\nmobility we get, there's delays.\n\n407\n00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,951\nThey get slower and slower.\n\n408\n00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:07,344\nNow, they don't mention it here\nin the exam, but, but Ronnie,\n\n409\n00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,949\nyou have a satellite connection at home,\nright?\n\n410\n00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,946\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nthe satellite connection is different.\n\n411\n00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,001\nInstead of Don having to go two miles,\n\n412\n00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:17,765\nDon's signal would have to bounce\nthrough the atmosphere in space.\n\n413\n00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:20,160\n[LAUGH] It is what you'd have to do.\n\n414\n00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,674\nBounce up to the signal and\nthen bounce back down to the earth.\n\n415\n00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:26,754\nAnd I normally get anywhere\nbetween 4 to 5,000\n\n416\n00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,559\nmilliseconds-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n417\n00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,458\n>> in my delay, in comparison to the 100s\nor, on the wireless network, even 20 or\n\n418\n00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,320\n30 milliseconds.\n\n419\n00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,080\n>> Yeah, and, you know,\nthe [LAUGH] the, the,\n\n420\n00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,740\nthe orbit, I, we don't know what\nthe orbit is for the satellite, right?\n\n421\n00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,990\nBut the accepted distance for\n\n422\n00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,620\nwhat is considered space by humanity\nis it's about 250 miles, right?\n\n423\n00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,026\nSo it's about 250 miles that his\nsignal's having to travel up, and\n\n424\n00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,374\nthen it hits the satellite,\nand what does it do?\n\n425\n00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:59,531\n>> Bounces back down again,\nas another 250 miles.\n\n426\n00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,950\nSo, that's a long distance\nthat you've got to travel.\n\n427\n00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,351\nAnd that's assuming the satellite\nis directly above you.\n\n428\n00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:09,040\nIt could be off at an angle, which is\ngonna make your distance even further.\n\n429\n00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,314\nIt could be a low orbit satellite.\n\n430\n00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:14,290\nYou know, not every satellite is truly\nin space, but then many of them are.\n\n431\n00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,500\nSo, that's a long way to go.\n\n432\n00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,788\nSo while that connection works, you,\n\n433\n00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:20,105\nyou can browse the web and stuff,\nthat'll work fine, right Ronnie?\n\n434\n00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:20,767\n>> Yes, yep.\n\n435\n00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:23,809\nDownloading, or trying to upload\nsomething's a little bit harder.\n\n436\n00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:26,520\n>> Yeah, and, and, and\nso there's that delay.\n\n437\n00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,720\nIf you tried to do a voice-over\nIP call I bet that would be fun.\n\n438\n00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960\n>> No, yeah, you're, you're terrible.\n\n439\n00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,705\n>> You have this huge delay, and when you\nmeasure it, you know, Ronnie you're saying\n\n440\n00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:36,740\nlike, 4,000 milliseconds, and\nthat's just four seconds.\n\n441\n00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,554\nSo imagine having a phone call\nwith somebody and saying, hi, and\n\n442\n00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:41,153\nthen waiting four seconds, right?\n\n443\n00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:44,700\nOne 1,000, two 1,000,\nthree 1,000, four 1,000, hi.\n\n444\n00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,906\nThat, that's what they hear on\nthe other end, this huge delay.\n\n445\n00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,564\nSo, that's not really ideal for\ncertain things, all right?\n\n446\n00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:53,269\nNow, when it comes to wired and wireless,\n\n447\n00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,115\nthe delay is close enough that\nwe might not worry about that.\n\n448\n00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,415\nAnd it's fine, voice over IP all that\nstuff works just fine, and off you go.\n\n449\n00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,905\nAll right?\n\n450\n00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:05,030\nBut, when it comes to cellular,\nthat can be a real problem.\n\n451\n00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,528\nAnd they prioritize the phone track.\n\n452\n00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,732\nThey want that to go with as little\ndelay as possible, but, but the,\n\n453\n00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:13,330\nthe internet connection may make it\nwhere things like video conferencing and\n\n454\n00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,122\nVOIP calls may not be suitable,\nor they may work just fine.\n\n455\n00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,562\nThe delay wasn't that bad.\n\n456\n00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:21,756\n100 milliseconds, you're talking about\na tenth of a second, that's not,\n\n457\n00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,580\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n458\n00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,211\nBut with satellite it is.\n\n459\n00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:24,871\nRight?\nSo, so\n\n460\n00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,718\nkeep that in mind as you look at it.\n\n461\n00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:31,027\nAll right, a couple of other things we\nneed to be aware of when we're selecting\n\n462\n00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,152\nthe network to use.\n\n463\n00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,394\nConcurrent connections.\n\n464\n00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:39,980\nWith a wired network,\nyou can connect as many hosts as you want.\n\n465\n00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,960\nIf you fill up your switch,\nyou can add another switch.\n\n466\n00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,620\nFill that one up, add another one.\n\n467\n00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,720\nYou can add as many as you want.\n\n468\n00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,610\nEverybody has one cable, and\nthey plug into a port, and\n\n469\n00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,010\nthey get access to the network.\n\n470\n00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,560\nAll right, but the more machines you have,\nthe more chatter you get on the network\n\n471\n00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,690\nand the network can start\nto get bogged down.\n\n472\n00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,360\nUsually somewhere in the area\nof about 300 machines, right?\n\n473\n00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,110\nSo when you have about 300 PCs or devices\non your network, you start to get a little\n\n474\n00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,700\nperformance degragate, degradation and\nyou need to divide up your network.\n\n475\n00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,070\nBut for small offices and home offices\nthat's not really gonna happen.\n\n476\n00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,090\nSo, concurrent connections is not\nsomething we really worry about\n\n477\n00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,280\nwhen it comes to physical connections.\n\n478\n00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,700\nBut it's different on wireless, isn't it?\n\n479\n00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n480\n00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,130\nYou know remember because everybody's\nactually connecting one antenna, and\n\n481\n00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,210\nonly one person can\nconnect at any one time,\n\n482\n00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,340\nwell that actually does limit\nus to a little bit more.\n\n483\n00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,808\nSo if you have wireless antenna\nthat may be 54 megabits per second,\n\n484\n00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:37,958\nyou keep dividing that up cuz everybody\nis trying to jam that at one time.\n\n485\n00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,625\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n486\n00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,708\n>> All of a sudden,\nthe bandwidth goes away.\n\n487\n00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,275\nIt, it becomes less than\n1 kilobit per second and\n\n488\n00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,792\nit may even get less than\nthat to the point where.\n\n489\n00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,084\nHalf the people are not\ngoing to be able to connect.\n\n490\n00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:50,977\n>> So, when you buy a wireless access\npoint they'll normally advertise, well,\n\n491\n00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:51,810\nthey usually don't.\n\n492\n00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,460\n>> No.\n>> Advertise in\n\n493\n00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,350\nreally big letters in the front of the\nbox, but it'll be in the manual somewhere,\n\n494\n00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,680\nwhere it will say the maximum\nnumber of simultaneous connections.\n\n495\n00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,200\nAnd your home routers are usually\nonly rated for like ten devices.\n\n496\n00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,910\nRight, not a lot, you can get enterprise\nones that can do 26 or 50 connections.\n\n497\n00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,900\nRight, a lot of the Cisco ones, or really\nnice Cisco ones, can do 50 connections.\n\n498\n00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,390\nBut, even there it, it's just 50.\n\n499\n00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,460\nSo, if you're providing wireless for\n\n500\n00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,370\na company with thousands of employees,\nyou're gonna have to have many access\n\n501\n00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,640\npoints spread out through your building\nto service all the various people, right?\n\n502\n00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,690\nSo, you do have a limit to the amount\nof concurrent connections you can have.\n\n503\n00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,330\nCellular networks, they can handle tons\nof connections right far beyond it, so\n\n504\n00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,220\nreally just the wireless access\npoints that we use they are the ones\n\n505\n00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,620\nthat truly create a bottleneck on this.\n\n506\n00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,430\nSo, just be aware of it the more antennas\nyour access point has the more connections\n\n507\n00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,060\nit will be able to support, but most of\nthem usually only have about two antennas.\n\n508\n00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,720\nAnd ones used as a send antenna,\nand ones used as a receive antenna.\n\n509\n00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,810\nAnd so it's really just a single antenna's\namount of concurrent users that you get.\n\n510\n00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,070\nThat's where that limit comes in.\n\n511\n00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,730\nAll right, what is our last point here?\n\n512\n00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,105\n>> Levels of security.\n\n513\n00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:00,780\n>> Yeah,\n\n514\n00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,790\neach of these connection types gives us\na different level of security, right?\n\n515\n00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,340\nThe one I like is wired.\n\n516\n00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,250\nWith wired you have a pretty\nhigh degree of security.\n\n517\n00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,730\nIf somebody wants to intercept my traffic\non my wired network, they're gonna\n\n518\n00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,710\ncome get in between my laptop and the\nnetwork somehow, to intercept my signals.\n\n519\n00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,500\nThat means they'd have to\nbe in the building with me.\n\n520\n00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,890\nI'd probably see them do it.\n\n521\n00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,940\nSo, you have a high\ndegree of security there,\n\n522\n00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,269\njust because the nature of\nthe being of a physical connection.\n\n523\n00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,660\n>> When the wireless not as secure,\nthe reason why is the single\n\n524\n00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,750\ngoes out in every single direction and the\nperson that may be trying to get access to\n\n525\n00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,590\nthat single doesn't have to\nbe in the same room with you.\n\n526\n00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,850\nBecause, the signal is actually emanating\nin all different directions, so\n\n527\n00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,530\nthat is less secure even with all the\nadditional security protocols we can add.\n\n528\n00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,730\nIs still less secure than having\na physical wired connection.\n\n529\n00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,800\n>> Yeah, I mean, you know our access point\nis mounted on that back wall which is\n\n530\n00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,300\nan exterior wall, it goes out a good\n100 feet out into the parking lot.\n\n531\n00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,860\nSo, somebody could be out in\nthe parking lot right now and,\n\n532\n00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,600\nit is encrypted, so there's that.\n\n533\n00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,610\nBut, they can be sitting there just\nworking away on it, capturing data,\n\n534\n00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,430\ntrying to decipher,\ntrying to figure out what that is.\n\n535\n00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,130\nI wouldn't even know they're there,\nthere's no window on that wall,\n\n536\n00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,270\nI can't, can't see, so\nthat's the problem with wireless.\n\n537\n00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,160\nAnd so we've got to be aware of that.\n\n538\n00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,110\nThat it does weaken our security.\n\n539\n00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,950\nAt least a little bit.\n\n540\n00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,490\nSo, that's why it's so\nimportant to encrypt that data.\n\n541\n00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,760\nNow what about cellular, right?\n\n542\n00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,610\nCellular, it is not impossible, but\n\n543\n00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,430\nit is difficult to intercept\ncellular signals, right?\n\n544\n00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,223\nIt's done at frequencies that regular\nconsumer grade equipment isn't allowed to\n\n545\n00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:42,380\ntalk on, so an attack, first off,\nis gonna have very specialized equipment.\n\n546\n00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,130\nFor a regular wireless network, anybody\ncan do that, but to intercept cellular,\n\n547\n00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,620\ncellular transmissions require\nspecialized equipment, so\n\n548\n00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,120\nthat's your first obstacle in\nintercepting that traffic.\n\n549\n00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320\nThe second obstacle, is just the sheer\namount of cellular traffic that's out\n\n550\n00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,230\nthere, so being able to identify traffic\nfrom one person is more challenging.\n\n551\n00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,450\nSo, there's a few little factors\nthat come into play there.\n\n552\n00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,840\nBut, the biggest weakness,\nthe biggest security issue we\n\n553\n00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,200\nreally have with cellular is\nIt's not your network, right?\n\n554\n00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360\nIt's somebody else's network.\n\n555\n00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,840\nIt's AT&T or Verizon or whoever.\n\n556\n00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,490\nWhoever it is you've bought your internet\naccess or your cellular access through,\n\n557\n00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,500\nand so you're trusting them to\nprovide you that secure communication.\n\n558\n00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,750\nOn a wired network, for local traffic,\nit's your network, but for\n\n559\n00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,220\ninternet you're still trusting\nsomebody else anyway.\n\n560\n00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,390\nSo on the cellular network it's\nnot that far of a leap, but\n\n561\n00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,850\nwe just have to be aware that these\nsignals are traveling miles potentially,\n\n562\n00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,820\nand there's a lot of room for\nsomebody to try and try and intercept.\n\n563\n00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,530\nBut, of them really just\ntraditional wireless.\n\n564\n00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,410\nThat's the weakest of the three, and\nthe one we have to worry about the most.\n\n565\n00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:52,690\nAll right, so,\nwhen it comes to comparing cellular,\n\n566\n00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,040\nwireless, and wired,\nthey've each got their advantages.\n\n567\n00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,660\nThey've all got pros and cons, and\n\n568\n00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,230\ndifferent scenarios one will be better\nthan the other based on your needs.\n\n569\n00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,190\nAnd it's basically gonna boil down to\nband within speed versus mobility or\n\n570\n00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,740\nsecurity versus mobility.\n\n571\n00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,060\nMobility is really what you get with\nthe wireless side of things, all right?\n\n572\n00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,222\nSo, just keep that in\nmind as you compare them.\n\n573\n00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,945\nCan you think anything else\nto throw in on that one?\n\n574\n00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,155\n>> I really can, I think we covered it\npretty well, and being able to discuss\n\n575\n00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:25,425\nthe mobility verses all the security, and\nall the other options that talked about.\n\n576\n00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:26,865\nSo, I think that's good coverage.\n\n577\n00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:27,855\n>> Cool.\n\n578\n00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:29,545\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's a good spot for\n\n579\n00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:30,840\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n580\n00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,650\nWe still have one more topic on networking\nto get to, which is 4.3, I will be taking\n\n581\n00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,910\na look at, ways of doing file sharing and\ndata exchanges on the internet.\n\n582\n00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,880\nSo that's kind of an important\nthing to be aware of, more and\n\n583\n00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,840\nmore people are doing that.\n\n584\n00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,000\nSo stay tuned for that segment coming up.\n\n585\n00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,590\nIn the meantime, if you have any\nquestions on what we've covered.\n\n586\n00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,980\nYou're always free to

00:00:37,290\nWelcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,770\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,650\nI'm your host Don Padgett,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,330\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,018\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:45,967\nWe're in for another exciting\nepisode here on IT fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:46,478\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:50,783\n>> And I believe we're taking a look at\nsome different ways to, to do storage.\n\n11\n00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:55,218\n>> Yeah, we're gonna dive into the last\nobjective that we have for networking.\n\n12\n00:00:55,218 --> 00:01:00,076\nOur official title for this one is 4.3,\ncompare and contrast different\n\n13\n00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:04,950\nmethods of sharing and storage, and\nwhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n14\n00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,110\nWell, when you have\nmore than one computer,\n\n15\n00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,260\nyou will often times find where you've\ngot a file on one computer, and\n\n16\n00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,040\nyou'd really like to have\nit on the other computer.\n\n17\n00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,390\nAnd sometimes the computers are right next\nto each other like Ronnie and I is, and\n\n18\n00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,080\nsometimes they're in different states or\ndifferent countries.\n\n19\n00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,260\nAnd you still need to be able to get those\nfiles, between the different systems.\n\n20\n00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,720\nSo, this is something I\nbump into all the time.\n\n21\n00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,560\nI've got a computer at home and when I'm\nat my computer at home, I might write up\n\n22\n00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,190\nshow notes or whatever, and then I get\nhere to the office and I'm on this laptop,\n\n23\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,720\nand I want access to those same files,\nso how do we exchange it?\n\n24\n00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,140\nWell, people, people go through\nvarious stages in their IT careers.\n\n25\n00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,120\nThey learn more and\nmore ways to transfer files,\n\n26\n00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,415\nand unfortunately the first phase is\nthe worst which is they use email.\n\n27\n00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:49,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n28\n00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,410\n>> Email is a terrible way to move files,\nand people do it all the time.\n\n29\n00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,750\nProblems with email are,\nfirst off it's designed for\n\n30\n00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,160\nemail, letters, not giant files.\n\n31\n00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,700\nThis is designed for very small emails.\n\n32\n00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,290\nThe larger your file, the more\ndamaging it is to the email servers.\n\n33\n00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,230\nSo they usually limit you to 10 megabit,\nor 10 megabytes of data.\n\n34\n00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,640\nSo you're kinda held to a small amount\nof data, that you can transmit that way.\n\n35\n00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,930\nThe second problem is,\nwell not just that but it's unencrypted.\n\n36\n00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,280\nEmails don't encrypt their data so\nif anybody intercepts that email,\n\n37\n00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,480\nthey get your file.\n\n38\n00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,160\nThe third problem is, if you change the\nfile after you've sent it, well too bad.\n\n39\n00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,270\nYou've already sent it, right?\n\n40\n00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,810\nSo, now it's out there, and\nnow you got multiple versions of a file.\n\n41\n00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,120\nThere's all sorts of\nproblems with that method.\n\n42\n00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,241\nSo, if you're one of those people that\nsends files by email, stop it, right now.\n\n43\n00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's, not the best way to do things.\n\n44\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,445\nSo, there are tons of other methods\nwe can use that are much better.\n\n45\n00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,945\nThat don't suffer from the problems\nof sending files via email.\n\n46\n00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:53,935\nAnd that's what CompT is\nreally calling out here is,\n\n47\n00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,965\nwhat are some of the ways that\nwe can do to exchange that data?\n\n48\n00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:02,140\nAll right, so the first thing they\nmention are web based file transfers.\n\n49\n00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,130\nMany websites out there makes files\navailable for you to download.\n\n50\n00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,310\nWe do it right off of our own webpage\nat ITProTV for our annual members.\n\n51\n00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,530\nThey can go and\ndownload episodes right from the site.\n\n52\n00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,970\nAnd, you don't need a special program,\nor special protocol to do that.\n\n53\n00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,200\nIt's done just via regular,\nHTTP, or HTTPS, right?\n\n54\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,320\nNow, when we download a file from the web,\nif it's, not a sensitive file,\n\n55\n00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,130\nif it's something like one of our\nepisodes, we don't bother encrypting that,\n\n56\n00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,600\nwe just send it using HTTP.\n\n57\n00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,350\nBut, if you're downloading\nsensitive documents or\n\n58\n00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,210\nfiles from a website,\nyou'll want that HTTPS.\n\n59\n00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,690\nYou'll want that secure,\nencrypted connection.\n\n60\n00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,360\nSo, it does vary based on\nwhat you're accessing.\n\n61\n00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,070\nBut if it's just,\n\n62\n00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,330\nlike downloading some new software,\nI doubt you'll see that HTTPS connection.\n\n63\n00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,130\nLet me just show an example,\nright, so Ronnie,\n\n64\n00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,180\nwhat's a, a software package that we\nmight want to install on a machine?\n\n65\n00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,930\n>> Usually for, for me,\nit's something like PuTTY.\n\n66\n00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,090\n>> PuTTY's a great example.\n\n67\n00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,240\nSo this is our network show, right?\n\n68\n00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,040\nAnd as a network person you might\nneed a Telnet or SSH client, or\n\n69\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,460\nwhatever, and PuTTY is a free one\nthat's available for download.\n\n70\n00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,740\nLet me just go and pull up their website.\n\n71\n00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,620\nAnd, so\nI'm gonna fire up my web browser, and\n\n72\n00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,620\nI'm gonna go to the PuTTY\ndownload webpage.\n\n73\n00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,800\nAnd so here's the download.\n\n74\n00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,810\nAnd they go on the list all\nthe files that I can download.\n\n75\n00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,665\nAnd I normally grab this installer\nright here, is that what you do Ronnie?\n\n76\n00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:23,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n77\n00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,520\nSo, there's the installer right there,\nand I can download and install it.\n\n78\n00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,000\nNow, when I float my mouse over,\nI'm kinda seeing an address down there.\n\n79\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,930\nBut I'm gonna copy that link and\npaste it up here, so we can really see it.\n\n80\n00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,790\nIt's just www dot the URL and then\npointing to, well actually that's just\n\n81\n00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,360\npointing right back to where I'm, isn't it\n>> Yeah.\n\n82\n00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,705\n>> It didn't actually copy\nthe link address did it?\n\n83\n00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,740\n[LAUGH] What is that all about?\n\n84\n00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,620\nLet me try that again.\n\n85\n00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,240\nMaybe I didn't LAUGH] that is my fault.\n\n86\n00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,308\nSo, let me, 10th time is the charm, right?\n\n87\n00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:58,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I do this over and\n\n88\n00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,500\nover again, there we go.\n\n89\n00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,190\n>> Oh!\n>> Sorry,\n\n90\n00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,950\nI was doing my Windows shortcut keys,\n\n91\n00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,918\nand I'm on-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,085\n>> A Mac, so they didn't work.\n\n93\n00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,435\nSo there we can see,\nthere's the file, right,\n\n94\n00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:11,835\nthis PuTTY installer right there, but\nlook at the protocol it's using HTTP.\n\n95\n00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,225\nThat's just like accessing\na normal webpage.\n\n96\n00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,465\nHTTP web servers can transmit files.\n\n97\n00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:20,455\nNow this one's not encrypted because,\nwho cares,\n\n98\n00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:23,895\nit's just a program anybody can go\ndownload it, it's not sensitive data and\n\n99\n00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:29,010\nin fact, even in this case, the source\ncode for it is down here somewhere if you\n\n100\n00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,060\nscroll around and you can find it,\nbut oh, there it is.\n\n101\n00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,890\nLike here's the source code for\nunix, the source code for Windows.\n\n102\n00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,290\nSo, if somebody wants that,\nthey can go and freely get it.\n\n103\n00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,680\nThere's no point in\nencrypting that kind of data.\n\n104\n00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,880\nAll right, but it it was information that\nwas sensitive, that link would be HTTPS,\n\n105\n00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,990\nand it would be encrypted to download.\n\n106\n00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,580\nSo, that's one of the best\nways to transmit files.\n\n107\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,540\nThere's no size limit.\n\n108\n00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,660\nIt could be a very large file, it could\nbe a very small file, it doesn't matter.\n\n109\n00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,170\nThe only problem with HTTP and HTTPS,\nis it's a one way communication.\n\n110\n00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,110\nWe can use it to download files.\n\n111\n00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,880\nYou can't really use it to upload a file.\n\n112\n00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,970\nI can't upload a file to this server.\n\n113\n00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,760\nThat would be disastrous, and\nso it's not a great way for\n\n114\n00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,770\njust the average user to share a file.\n\n115\n00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,700\nYour average user's not gonna bring\nup a web server, create a web page,\n\n116\n00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,580\nstick the file in there, and\nput a link there, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,980\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n118\n00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,920\nSo, we need other solutions, right?\n\n119\n00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,498\nAnd that's what the whole rest\nof this exam objective is about,\n\n120\n00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:22,373\nare there other solutions\nthat are out there?\n\n121\n00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,642\nSo, what are some of those solutions?\n\n122\n00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:29,577\n>> And Don I noticed that on that download\npage, I saw a little link there said FTP.\n\n123\n00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:30,668\n>> Did we?\n\n124\n00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:31,591\n>> Yes, we did.\n\n125\n00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,791\n>> For the source code okay,\nyeah there are several.\n\n126\n00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,679\nSo when we look at those links,\nlike here where I did the installer,\n\n127\n00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,330\nthat was just the HTTP link.\n\n128\n00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,090\nBut, right beside of it it says,\nor by FTP.\n\n129\n00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,660\nNow, what is FTP?\n\n130\n00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,240\nStands for file transfer protocol.\n\n131\n00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,490\nBack in the 1980s and\nearly 1990s, that was\n\n132\n00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,010\nthe way to move files between computers\nif you were using a Unix based system.\n\n133\n00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,420\nIt was very common, very commonly used,\nand so today we still see it.\n\n134\n00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,350\nAnd it's not just Unix anymore,\nnow it's Windows and.\n\n135\n00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,160\nAnd Mac, and whatever, so\nyou see, it's all over the place.\n\n136\n00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,690\nIt's a simple way to transfer files.\n\n137\n00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,120\nAnd the cool thing about it is,\nyou can upload and download.\n\n138\n00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,830\nIt becomes a great way to\nstore files somewhere else,\n\n139\n00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,380\nand access them and add to them.\n\n140\n00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,950\nNow, there are some problems with FTP,\n\n141\n00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,450\nmost markedly that it is\nnot encrypted by default so\n\n142\n00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,570\nyour data is being sent in plain text,\nincluding your username and password.\n\n143\n00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,750\nCuz you normally will do a username and\npassword on these, to secure them.\n\n144\n00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,530\nAll right.\n\n145\n00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,820\nSo there have been some upgrades\nto FTP over the years, and\n\n146\n00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,130\nthere's a few different versions now.\n\n147\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,079\nSo in the exam objectives\nthey call out FTP,\n\n148\n00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,688\nSFTP and FTPS, so\nwhat's that all about, right?\n\n149\n00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:49,291\nWhat, are all those?\n\n150\n00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,492\n>> The FTPS and\nthe SFTP are two different ways.\n\n151\n00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:57,347\nThen we add encryption into\nthe file transfer protocol.\n\n152\n00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:04,112\nNow with FTPS, it is taking FTP, and\nadding in another security protocol SFTP,\n\n153\n00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:08,700\nI believe is actually\na different protocol by itself.\n\n154\n00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,590\n>> Yeah, so with it all depends on\nwhere the S is, that's confusing right?\n\n155\n00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,620\nSo, with SFTP.\n\n156\n00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,760\nThat's secure file transfer protocol, and\nwhat it does is it builds an SSH tunnel.\n\n157\n00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,960\nIf you never heard of SSH, it's a secure\nshell and it's an encryption protocol, and\n\n158\n00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,980\nit builds a tunnel between your\nmachine and another machine.\n\n159\n00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,020\nAnd the cool thing about SFH,\nis once you have that tunnel up,\n\n160\n00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,000\nyou can send any traffic you want over it.\n\n161\n00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,620\nNot just FTP, you can send anything,\n\n162\n00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,170\nterminal session, streaming video,\nwhatever you want, right?\n\n163\n00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,410\nSo they're not changing FTP, it still\nworks the same, the difference is they\n\n164\n00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,640\nbuild an SSH tunnel first, and then FTP\nis sent over that encrypted tunnel.\n\n165\n00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,250\nSo FTP works like it always did, it's\njust getting encrypted behind the scene.\n\n166\n00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,030\nThat's secure FTP.\n\n167\n00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,880\nNow, if we put the S at the end,\nnow it's FTPS,\n\n168\n00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,280\nthat's file transfer protocol with SSL,\nall right?\n\n169\n00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280\nSSL, the secure socket layer, that's\nwhat we use to encrypt web page access.\n\n170\n00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,400\nWhen we saw HTTP versus HTTPS, well, that\nmeans that you're using SSL, the s right\n\n171\n00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,570\nthere, is secure socket layer to encrypt\nthat communication to the web server.\n\n172\n00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,980\nWell, FTPS uses the same technology,\njust with FTP, right?\n\n173\n00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,050\nRetro fitting this old\nprotocol to have security.\n\n174\n00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,920\nSo, we can make that type of a server\nmore secure than it is natively,\n\n175\n00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,550\nthe FTP standard by itself has no\nreal security beyond a username and\n\n176\n00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,970\na password, and that's set in plain text,\nwhich is dangerous.\n\n177\n00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,950\nSo, both of these go to fixes.\n\n178\n00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,750\nAnd which are you gonna use?\n\n179\n00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,480\nIt's up to you.\n\n180\n00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,930\nWhichever one you support.\n\n181\n00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,700\nDifferent files, different FTP servers.\n\n182\n00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,400\nSupport one versus the other.\n\n183\n00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,705\nSo, one of the really common FTP servers\nthat we use here in the office is from\n\n184\n00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,360\nFilezilla.\n\n185\n00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,290\nIt's a open source free\nfile server you can get.\n\n186\n00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,910\nAnd Filezilla supports FTPS, but not SFTP.\n\n187\n00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,920\nBut, there's other ones out\nthere that do support SFTP.\n\n188\n00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,010\nSo you can find, whichever one\nyou want that meets your needs.\n\n189\n00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,700\nI will say that SFTP, can actually\ngive you better security than FTPS.\n\n190\n00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,490\nIt does give you some higher bit rates and\n\n191\n00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,020\nthings, most of us don't\nneed to worry about that.\n\n192\n00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,390\nAll right,\nlet me show you an example of using FTP.\n\n193\n00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,440\nWe've got a server here in the office,\nwhere I store like a lot of a, router and\n\n194\n00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,860\nswitch form updates, so I can get at them.\n\n195\n00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,930\nAnd I accessed it via FTP, and\n\n196\n00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,660\nit's an internal server, so\nI don't really worry about securing it.\n\n197\n00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,020\nSo, like I have it set not to\nrequire a username and password,\n\n198\n00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,490\nbecause it's just internal.\n\n199\n00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,750\nSo, it's on our network and that's it.\n\n200\n00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,020\nSo, if I wanna connect to it,\nI've got to set up for FTP, and\n\n201\n00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,190\nI can reach right out to it.\n\n202\n00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,480\nSo here it's just saying use plain FTP,\nand when I connect, here's the server.\n\n203\n00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,610\nAnd so I can see I've got some backups,\nand phone firmware.\n\n204\n00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,810\nThis is a firmware for our thin clients.\n\n205\n00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,960\nSo, if I wanna go in and\nget that firmware for my thin clients,\n\n206\n00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,100\nI can grab it here and I can download it.\n\n207\n00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,880\nSo here's my desktop.\n\n208\n00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,710\nAnd, I can come over and\njust choose to download it.\n\n209\n00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,760\nAnd I'm downloading that file and\nnow I've got it, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,050\nNow, let's say I go out and\nthere's been an update.\n\n211\n00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,438\nSo this was 8.0, 1, 3 beta, whatever.\n\n212\n00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:29,760\nSo, we'll come out and say maybe they\ncame out with a new update, right?\n\n213\n00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,130\nSo, I get this new update.\n\n214\n00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,590\nI download it from, from where ever.\n\n215\n00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,930\nI'm using it on my systems.\n\n216\n00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,450\nI might wanna upload it.\n\n217\n00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,130\nTo have it here on the server for\nme when I come back.\n\n218\n00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,310\nAnd I can go here and upload it, and\nit's gonna copy it up to the server and\n\n219\n00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,510\nthere it is, all right?\n\n220\n00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,290\nSo, I can add Files.\n\n221\n00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,590\nOne of the neat things about FTP,\nis most FTP servers support file resume.\n\n222\n00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,200\nSo, if you're doing a big\nfile like 10 gigabyte file.\n\n223\n00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240\nThat might take an hour to upload.\n\n224\n00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,630\nWhat happens if you lose\nconnection halfway?\n\n225\n00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,760\nWell if this were like an HTTP download,\nyou'd have to start all over again.\n\n226\n00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,510\nWith an FTP it can pick up right\nwhere it left off and resume.\n\n227\n00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,070\nAnd so that's really nice.\n\n228\n00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,240\nAnd it makes it a lot easier\nto transmit files reliably.\n\n229\n00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,620\nI'm gonna delete this just so\nin the future,\n\n230\n00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,075\nI don't think it's actually an update.\n\n231\n00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:20,610\n[LAUGH] So the only problem here is\nall those transfers that I just did,\n\n232\n00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,650\nwere sent in plain text\nacross the network.\n\n233\n00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,745\nIf somebody was monitoring my network.\n\n234\n00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,155\nIt could've captured all that.\n\n235\n00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:28,675\nThe username and password that I sent,\nthe file itself.\n\n236\n00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,565\nThey could've captured it all, all right?\n\n237\n00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,075\nSo that server,\nwhile I don't really worry about security,\n\n238\n00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:38,205\nbecause it's local, I do have the security\nturned on if I want to use it.\n\n239\n00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:41,525\nSo, I can tell it to use\nFTPS to connect to it.\n\n240\n00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:45,215\nSo, notice here that\nI'm using FTP over TLS.\n\n241\n00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:48,020\nNow, I said SSL earlier, right?\n\n242\n00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,010\nTLS is the replacement for SSL.\n\n243\n00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,390\nYou had SSL version 1,\nversion 2, version 3.\n\n244\n00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,350\nAnd then TLS version 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.\n\n245\n00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,295\nSo, when people say SSL nowadays it's\nreally TLS version version 1.2 or 1.3 the.\n\n246\n00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:05,595\nSo this one just actually says TLS.\n\n247\n00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:10,535\nThat just stands for transport layer\nsecurity it's the replacement.\n\n248\n00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,875\nSo, I'm gonna choose to connect.\n\n249\n00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,115\nNow when I connected a minute ago,\nmy little connection,\n\n250\n00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:19,065\nwe know, it's kinda hard to see\ndown here what all happened, right?\n\n251\n00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,630\nBut when I connected, it reached out\nto an IP, it established a session,\n\n252\n00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,940\nit sent my username and my password,\nand then I was on, right?\n\n253\n00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,440\nThose are the steps that\nit went through connecting.\n\n254\n00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,160\nWhen I connect with FTPS,\nthere's gonna be an extra step.\n\n255\n00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,710\nIt's gonna hand off a certificate,\n\n256\n00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,910\nwhich is what I'm gonna\nuse as an encryption key.\n\n257\n00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,090\nAnd from that point on, I'm gonna be\nencrypting everything that I send.\n\n258\n00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,690\nSo, when I connect this way,\na certificate handoff happens, and\n\n259\n00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,220\nhere's the certificate and\nit's asking me whether I trust this?\n\n260\n00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,610\nSo, it's showing the information on\nthe certificate and if I trust it,\n\n261\n00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,980\nI can say okay, and now I'm encrypting\neverything that I send to that server.\n\n262\n00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,650\nSo, when I look at my connection,\n\n263\n00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,880\na little more happened this\ntime than the last time.\n\n264\n00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,650\nHere's that initializing TLS, verifying\ncertificate, TLS connexion established.\n\n265\n00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,710\nAnd see how it says TLS slash SSL, right?\n\n266\n00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,230\nThere's that connexion and then,\nonly then, do I send my password.\n\n267\n00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,390\nThat's encrypted.\n\n268\n00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,190\nAnd everything else is now\ngoing to be encrypted.\n\n269\n00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,260\nSo, if I go and\ndownload that firmware again, right?\n\n270\n00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,010\nNow, I download it.\n\n271\n00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,160\nAnd it's encrypted in transit.\n\n272\n00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,820\nIf somebody intercepts that traffic,\nthey just see encrypted junk.\n\n273\n00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,340\nAnd then if I go and upload it again,\nright, so here I'll go and upload it.\n\n274\n00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,740\nNow it's gonna be sent\nto the other system, and\n\n275\n00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,950\nit's been encrypted on the way up.\n\n276\n00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,798\nSo, I get much greater security with this.\n\n277\n00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:50,830\nJust because FTP is not secure by\ndefault doesn't mean don't use it.\n\n278\n00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,930\nIt just means.\n\n279\n00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,670\nAdd something to it that makes it secure,\nand FTPS and SFTP, are the way to do that.\n\n280\n00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,090\nAll right, now, there is a difference,\nbetween storage that you have locally,\n\n281\n00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,390\nand storage that you make available,\nremotely, right?\n\n282\n00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,060\nLocal storage you might do like me,\nand choose not to secure it,\n\n283\n00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,470\nbut remote storage.\n\n284\n00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,940\nYou definitely want to secure that.\n\n285\n00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,940\n>> Local storage is the storage\non your own computer,\n\n286\n00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,770\nwhich is your own hard drive, or\nyou may even have your own little\n\n287\n00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,100\nUSB drive that you tend to\nplug into the computer.\n\n288\n00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,560\nToday was very popular instead of carrying\nall those extra storage devices around,\n\n289\n00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,340\nis the ability to do what we call\nhosted storage or cloud storage today.\n\n290\n00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,700\nAnd, that's really becoming\nincredibly popular.\n\n291\n00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,660\n>> Yes, so basically you're, you're\ncounting on somebody else to help you and\n\n292\n00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,860\nthere are a number of companies doing, so\nyou've got the market leader at least for\n\n293\n00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,011\nright now is Drop Box.\n\n294\n00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,870\nYou've also got Box is a, another company.\n\n295\n00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,730\nThere's Microsoft's OneDrive,\nthere's Apple's iCloud drive.\n\n296\n00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,599\nIs that what it's called, I think?\n\n297\n00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:58,627\n>> idrive\n>> There's Amazon's cloud storage service.\n\n298\n00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:02,307\nThere's a ton of companies that have\nthese shared storage models, and\n\n299\n00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:05,870\nwhat you do is you sign up with them,\nand a lot of them are free.\n\n300\n00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,190\nRight?\nOr they have a free tier.\n\n301\n00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,090\nSo if you get Microsoft One Drive they\ngive you 15 gigabytes of storage free.\n\n302\n00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,650\nOr if you sign up with Dropbox I think\nthey only give you five gigs or something.\n\n303\n00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,130\nI forget what their free level is.\n\n304\n00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,970\nBut they all give you a little bit of\nstorage for free so you can try it out.\n\n305\n00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,030\nAnd when you put your files there,\nwhenever you're on a computer, any\n\n306\n00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,688\ncomputer, you can log into their website\nand you can access your files, right.\n\n307\n00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,840\nI'll show you an example here.\n\n308\n00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,470\nI'll use Microsoft OneDrive.\n\n309\n00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,940\nAnd I'll tell you I don't really\nuse OneDrive much in real life,\n\n310\n00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,840\nbut I use some of\nthe other services instead.\n\n311\n00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,110\nAnd, and I'm a little paranoid I guess.\n\n312\n00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,790\nBut but here's an example.\n\n313\n00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,815\nSo here's a, here's a OneDrive account,\nand it's a webpage that you go to,\n\n314\n00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:52,010\nonedrive.microsoft.com, but\nit redirects to live.com.\n\n315\n00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,680\nSo here's my, my, my,\nmy web based storage.\n\n316\n00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,620\nAnd when I go in here\nit's got a documents and\n\n317\n00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,700\na pictures folder which\nI'm not really using.\n\n318\n00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,820\nBut I could come in and\nmake my own folders if I wanted to.\n\n319\n00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,610\nSo you'll see under Create I\ncan create a Folder,\n\n320\n00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,720\nand maybe I'll call this Show Notes.\n\n321\n00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,520\nAll right?\nSo I'm going to create\n\n322\n00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,330\na Show Notes folder right here.\n\n323\n00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,070\nAnd then what I can do is\nI can put files in here.\n\n324\n00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,720\nI've got this Upload option.\n\n325\n00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,990\nIf I want to upload my files\nit will let me come in and\n\n326\n00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,340\npick the files that I want to upload and\nI can go and find shownotes, or whatever,\n\n327\n00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,850\nI'm sure I've got some\nshownotes laying around here.\n\n328\n00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,161\nLet's see.\nWe've got those buried somewhere,\n\n329\n00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:33,150\nhere let's,\nlet's pull the shownotes with this shot.\n\n330\n00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,080\nHere we go.\n\n331\n00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,920\nSo I'll take all these different\nshow notes that I've got and\n\n332\n00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,230\nwe'll just grab them and I'll hit Open,\nand now it's gonna upload those.\n\n333\n00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,280\nSo there they go.\n\n334\n00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,039\nI'm uploading them into one drive and\nfrom now on,\n\n335\n00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,144\nif I want access to those shownotes,\nI don't have to carry around a USB key,\n\n336\n00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,800\nI don't have to have them\non my local hard drive.\n\n337\n00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200\nI can just log into this webpage and\nthey'll be waiting for me right there.\n\n338\n00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,790\nAll right?\nSo, when I'm ready to do my compare and\n\n339\n00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,210\ncontrast common something or another here.\n\n340\n00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,450\nHere's the file waiting for me and\n\n341\n00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,120\nif I click on it, it's gonna bring it up\nand I can actually see the shownotes.\n\n342\n00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,970\nHere's the notes from that episode.\n\n343\n00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,570\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,800\nI can see them, or,\nactually it'll let me edit this one.\n\n345\n00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,240\nSometimes it'll let you edit the file,\nsometimes it won't.\n\n346\n00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,450\nAnd then, the other thing is if I\nwanna download it, I can download it.\n\n347\n00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,560\nAnd now I have a copy on\nthe machine that I'm on.\n\n348\n00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,550\nBut I'm never far from my files anymore,\nright?\n\n349\n00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:31,250\nAnd even better if my hard drive crashes,\nif my laptop gets stolen,\n\n350\n00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,080\nI didn't lose all my data,\nit's still there in the cloud service.\n\n351\n00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,650\nI can go and get it.\n\n352\n00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,140\nBut security becomes a bigger concern.\n\n353\n00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,900\nWe're letting somebody\nelse hold our files.\n\n354\n00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,030\nWe're trusting them.\n\n355\n00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,190\nI'm trusting Microsoft to\ntake care of these files.\n\n356\n00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,180\nAnd they'll provide me\nwith certain things right?\n\n357\n00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,015\nNotice up here, HTTPS.\n\n358\n00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:54,195\nThis is a secure web page, so it is\nbeing encrypted, my data going up and\n\n359\n00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,705\ndata coming down, but\ncould somebody get into this account?\n\n360\n00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,105\nIt's possible.\n\n361\n00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,675\nNow, I'm just as big a player in that.\n\n362\n00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:04,060\nIf I pick a, a weak password or,\nor do something that,\n\n363\n00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,440\nthat compromises the account that way,\nI'm, I'm just as guilty as them for\n\n364\n00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,840\nnot keeping my system secure.\n\n365\n00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780\nBut we are counting on them,\n\n366\n00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,000\nyou wanna make sure that it's a company\nyou trust to host your data like that.\n\n367\n00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,340\nAll right?\nAnd to this day,\n\n368\n00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,920\nI, I've used a lot of cloud\nservices to store data, but\n\n369\n00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,460\nmy own sensitive information, right, like\nmy tax returns, things like that, I don't\n\n370\n00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,730\nlike to put those in cloud services like\nthese, I use my own system for that.\n\n371\n00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,320\nSo so keep that in mind with\ncloud based or just out there.\n\n372\n00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,310\nOne of the really cool features is\nthat you can collaborate with it.\n\n373\n00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,400\nAnd you might have noticed the way I was\nbrowsing to this stuff a minute ago.\n\n374\n00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,990\nWe actually use, ITProTV,\nwe use Google apps for work.\n\n375\n00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,930\nAnd with Google apps for\n\n376\n00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,358\nwork you have central storage like this\nthat you can share amongst team mates.\n\n377\n00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:52,180\nSo that shownotes folder that I went into\na moment ago that had all our real notes,\n\n378\n00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,930\nwell I've shared that with Ronnie and\nMike and Nate and Wes and\n\n379\n00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,040\nall the other hosts that you've seen\non the show, so that if I make notes\n\n380\n00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,045\nthey can see them, and if they make notes\nI can see them, it's all collaborative.\n\n381\n00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,085\nAnd that's a big advantage\nof cloud based storage,\n\n382\n00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,045\nthat we don't have our datas on a USB key.\n\n383\n00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:07,595\nRight?\n\n384\n00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:11,585\nI'd have to loan Ronnie my USB key and\nthen I wouldn't have it anymore.\n\n385\n00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,135\nAnd, the other thing is if we make copies,\n\n386\n00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,885\nnow we all have different\nversions of the document.\n\n387\n00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,625\nBut here, all in one place.\n\n388\n00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,875\nIf I change it,\neverybody sees the changes.\n\n389\n00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,645\nI don't have to worry about people\nlooking at outdated copies of my files.\n\n390\n00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,610\n>> And, speaking of that collaboration.\n\n391\n00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,995\nWe also have collaborative software\nthat we can get access to as well.\n\n392\n00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:30,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n393\n00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,890\nwe actually did this the other day\nwhere we were working on shownotes and\n\n394\n00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,330\nwe were pulling up\nthe exact same document.\n\n395\n00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,000\nDon was working on one\npart of the document and\n\n396\n00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,490\nI was actually working on\nanother part of the document.\n\n397\n00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,760\nAnd we were using the same\ndocument to do so\n\n398\n00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,010\nthrough the actual applications\nthat are out there.\n\n399\n00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,720\n>> Yeah, those are all benefits, things\nthat you get with cloud-based services and\n\n400\n00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,710\nit's, it's pretty cool stuff, you know.\n\n401\n00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,190\nAnd, and, and, used correctly,\nit can really empower your company.\n\n402\n00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,910\nBut there is that level of trust, right?\n\n403\n00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,020\nYou're trusting that company to,\nto host your data, so for\n\n404\n00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,390\nour shownotes we trust Google.\n\n405\n00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,050\nAnd if I ever have to get up here on the\nshow and say, sorry guys, we lost our show\n\n406\n00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,615\nnotes, well, that either means that one,\nI forgot to upload it to Google.\n\n407\n00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:10,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or two, Google screwed up.\n\n408\n00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,215\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n409\n00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:11,915\n>> I mean, that's, that's who I\n\n410\n00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,330\ntrust to handle that data.\n\n411\n00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,700\nSo it is a good idea to have\nlocal backups of this data.\n\n412\n00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,780\nI, I always do.\n\n413\n00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,780\nBut hopefully that vendor is\ntaking care of your data for you.\n\n414\n00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,080\nAll right, now when it comes to\nsharing resources between our systems,\n\n415\n00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,300\nfiles aren't the only thing.\n\n416\n00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,040\nWe also share things like printers.\n\n417\n00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,640\nOkay?\n\n418\n00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,220\nSo, a printer, you might have one\ndirectly connected to your computer,\n\n419\n00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,960\nbut in today's world,\nmost printers are network-enabled.\n\n420\n00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,140\nThey might have a wireless card built\ninto them or plug into your network, so\n\n421\n00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,600\nthat you can access them from\ndevices that don't have ports.\n\n422\n00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,021\nYou know, if you have an iPad,\n\n423\n00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,600\nthere's no way to attach\na printer directly to an iPad.\n\n424\n00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,960\nOr no way that I know of.\n\n425\n00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920\nI imagine somebody might make something.\n\n426\n00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,730\nBut if you have a printer that's wireless,\n\n427\n00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,000\nthe iPad can print right\nto it over the wireless.\n\n428\n00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,650\nSo that is a pretty common thing.\n\n429\n00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,070\nAnd you've probably seen\nthat here on the show.\n\n430\n00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,430\nLike, if we go back to my desktop.\n\n431\n00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,170\nWhenever I look at the wireless\nnetworks that are available.\n\n432\n00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,760\nSee how I've got these HP print?\n\n433\n00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,960\nRight?\nThat's Tim and Rene's printers.\n\n434\n00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,210\nThey have some HP printers that\nhave wireless cards in them, and\n\n435\n00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,020\nif I wanted to take my, my cell phone,\nor my tablet, or my laptop, and\n\n436\n00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,840\nprint right to those, I could connect to\nthem via the wireless and print, right.\n\n437\n00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200\nit's a shared printer,\nmany of us could all connect to that and\n\n438\n00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,820\nwe'd be ready to run.\n\n439\n00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,010\nVersus a printer with a USB cable,\nyou plug into one computer and that's it,\n\n440\n00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,510\nthat computer gets access,\nnobody else does.\n\n441\n00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:40,680\nAll right, now when it comes to\nsharing resources like this,\n\n442\n00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,460\nat, at this level, for this exam for\ncomp T IT fundamentals they're,\n\n443\n00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,150\nthey're talking about what\nare considered work group networks.\n\n444\n00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,100\nAnd a work group is where you have\na bunch of independent computers, so\n\n445\n00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,510\nif you use security, use a user name and\npassword on your systems.\n\n446\n00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,360\nEach computer has its own separate\nset of user names and passwords.\n\n447\n00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,450\nSo, when you go to browse and access a\nresource, you may have to punch in a user\n\n448\n00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,460\nname and password and It could be, you\nknow, different for many, many machines.\n\n449\n00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,940\nThat doesn't scale very well, right?\n\n450\n00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,260\nFor homes that works great, for\n\n451\n00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,780\na business where you have a hundred\ncomputers it's a nightmare.\n\n452\n00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,310\nSo businesses will use things like\ndirectories to simplify that a lot.\n\n453\n00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,720\nBut with a work group,\n\n454\n00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,320\njust a simple couple of machines,\nwe can share files pretty easily and for\n\n455\n00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,069\na work group we're not normally\nworried about usernames and passwords.\n\n456\n00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:32,070\nYou know, I've got shared folders\non my network at home that I,\n\n457\n00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,020\nI don't password protect, because I, I\nwant the other machines in the network to\n\n458\n00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,130\nbe able to gain access, and\nI don't want to set up anything complex,\n\n459\n00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:44,010\nI don't want to set up a central user\ndirectory or, or anything like that.\n\n460\n00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,920\nIt can be complex, if you, if you let it.\n\n461\n00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,803\n>> The other one they mention is\nsomething called home group, now,\n\n462\n00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:55,742\nnow home group This is actually kind of a,\na neat way to build network computers\n\n463\n00:23:55,742 --> 00:24:00,331\ntogether so that we can share things\nlike files, and of course multimedia and\n\n464\n00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:05,690\nother things like printers without really\nhaving to set up any type of networking.\n\n465\n00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,320\nIt really is providing a password and\n\n466\n00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,470\neverybody can connect\nusing that same password.\n\n467\n00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,230\nOne machine sets up this home group,\nand everybody else connects in.\n\n468\n00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,828\nAnd as far as I know,\nthat's only really with Windows computers.\n\n469\n00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:17,497\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n470\n00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,180\nthat, what that is is Microsoft trying\nto take away a pain point, right?\n\n471\n00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,790\nIf you've got a couple\nof separate machines and\n\n472\n00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,340\nyou don't have some central directory,\nwhich most people don't have at home,\n\n473\n00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,650\nhow is there a way to securely\nshare data between them?\n\n474\n00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,057\nAnd the home group works really easy.\n\n475\n00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,499\nLet me, let me show you an example here.\n\n476\n00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,635\nI've got a, a Windows 7 machine pulled up.\n\n477\n00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:39,328\nAnd, here's where it's saying like,\nI can't connect to a home group.\n\n478\n00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:42,086\nThere isn't one that's out there,\nand you know,\n\n479\n00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:46,150\nif there was a home group available in my\nnetwork, I would be able to connect to it.\n\n480\n00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,420\nNow, apparently I'm already a member or\nsomebody else made one.\n\n481\n00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,820\nSo it's telling me that I can't- oh.\n\n482\n00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,769\nI'm-\n>> Yeah.\n\n483\n00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:54,278\n>> I'm, I'm not set to a home network,\nis my problem.\n\n484\n00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:54,882\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n485\n00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:59,066\n>> So, when you set up a Windows machine,\nit asks what kind of network you're on,\n\n486\n00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:02,550\nand you'll see that I've told\nit I'm on a work network.\n\n487\n00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,980\nAnd so, if I had told it I was on a home\nnetwork, it would've known to go ahead and\n\n488\n00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,790\nchange this.\n\n489\n00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,460\nSo here I'm just gonna switch\nit over to a home network.\n\n490\n00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,298\nAll right?\n\n491\n00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:11,950\nSo let me do that.\n\n492\n00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,436\nI, I don't think that'll drop my screen\n\n493\n00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:14,191\nshare-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n494\n00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,015\n>> But we'll, we'll see.\n\n495\n00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,909\nAnytime you mess with your\nnetwork adapter, right?\n\n496\n00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,175\nI'm, I'm just sharing my\nscreen via the network.\n\n497\n00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:19,970\nSo I, I might lose it.\n\n498\n00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,500\nBut I'm just gonna flip it over\nto a home network real quick.\n\n499\n00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,668\nAnd once that's done, if there's a home\ngroup already created I'll be able to join\n\n500\n00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:28,444\nit, and if there isn't one,\nI'll be able to make one.\n\n501\n00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,760\nHere's just asking if I wanna share\npictures, videos, printers, right?\n\n502\n00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,750\nSo I'll go ahead and do that one.\n\n503\n00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,970\nAnd, now it's looking to see if\nthere's a home group on the network.\n\n504\n00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,320\nThere wasn't one, so it just made one.\n\n505\n00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,232\nIt made a home group, and\nhere's the password, all right?\n\n506\n00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:49,430\nAnd that's the password that people will\nbe able to use to connect to my machine.\n\n507\n00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,238\nAnd if I have five computers, I can go\nput this password in all five of them.\n\n508\n00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,821\nAnd now, they'll all be able to\nsee each other securely, but\n\n509\n00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,866\nanybody who doesn't have\nhis password won't.\n\n510\n00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,839\nIt makes it a lot easier\nto share files locally.\n\n511\n00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,488\nThis won't work across the internet.\n\n512\n00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:03,068\nRight?\n\n513\n00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:05,205\nSo these will be people\nhere in your house.\n\n514\n00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:06,948\nAnd that's why they call it a Home Group.\n\n515\n00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:09,345\nThe idea is, you know,\nhusband, wife, kids,\n\n516\n00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:13,566\nthey, they have their different systems,\nand they all wanna be able to share files.\n\n517\n00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,310\nThis makes it quick and easy.\n\n518\n00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,832\nAll right?\n\n519\n00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:18,214\nSo, I've got a home group.\n\n520\n00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,490\nHow exciting.\n\n521\n00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,830\nNow, you can only have one\nhome group on a network.\n\n522\n00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,610\nSo now that I've made one,\nif anybody else fires up a machine,\n\n523\n00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,020\nit's gonna see that one and try and\njoin it, or it'll just stop them.\n\n524\n00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,610\nSo so that's set up, I'm in business.\n\n525\n00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,743\nAnd I can always exit\nthe homegroup if I want.\n\n526\n00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:37,691\nYou'll see leave the homegroup as\nan option down here, and I can get out so\n\n527\n00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:41,974\nI'll just say I'll leave the homegroup,\nand now I'm not a part of it anymore.\n\n528\n00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:45,102\nSo, those services meet, Ronnie you\nmentioned it's Windows only, and\n\n529\n00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:46,317\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n530\n00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:49,789\nAnd if you're on a Linux machine or\na Mac, they don't do Homegroups.\n\n531\n00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,100\nSo that functionality is\nnot gonna available to you.\n\n532\n00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,540\nYou'll have to find another option.\n\n533\n00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,820\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n534\n00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:01,230\nAll right, we've got a few\nother things to talk about,\n\n535\n00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,620\nbut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n536\n00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,854\nSo why don't we pause here for a breather,\nand when we get back, we're gonna continue\n\n537\n00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:11,044\non with some more types of storage\nthat we can use on our network and\n\n538\n00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:14,300\nmore places we can put our files,\nand we'll wrap up from there.\n\n539\n00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,466\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n540\n00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:24,303\n[MUSIC]\n\n541\n00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:25,418\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n542\n00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:28,942\nSo, we're gonna continue on\nour thought about storage, and\n\n543\n00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:32,960\ntackle a few different types of\nstorage that might be available to us.\n\n544\n00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,550\nSo, what we've been talking about so\n\n545\n00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,080\nfar are ways that we can share\ndata across the network, but\n\n546\n00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,420\nwe need to keep our data somewhere and\nwe saw like an FTP server's an example.\n\n547\n00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,520\nWe saw Microsoft OneDrive or\na cloud service as an example.\n\n548\n00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,990\nBut, there's nothing in, in my opinion,\n\n549\n00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:54,030\nthere's no substitute to\nstoring your own data.\n\n550\n00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,670\nIf you store your own data,\nyou know who's protecting it.\n\n551\n00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,280\nYou know what's happening with that data.\n\n552\n00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,530\nNow, you are responsible for backing it up\nand securing it so that, that could always\n\n553\n00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,130\nbe a problem if you don't take proper\nprecautions, but it's up to you.\n\n554\n00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,978\nYou've got that control.\n\n555\n00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:10,321\nSo let's talk about some of the different\nthings that are available for us there.\n\n556\n00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:15,200\nWhen we have multiple computers and\nwanna share data, well, you can have all\n\n557\n00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,270\nthe files on one computer, and\nit can share them on the network.\n\n558\n00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,610\nYou can use things like a home group,\nand another computer can access it.\n\n559\n00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,848\nThe only problem with that model is, if\nI have all the files on my computer, and\n\n560\n00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:29,947\nI turn my computer off,\nwhat happens to everybody else?\n\n561\n00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:30,782\n>> No access.\n\n562\n00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:31,850\n>> They're out of luck.\n\n563\n00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,470\nYeah, they can't get to the data.\n\n564\n00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,140\nSo it would be nice if we had some\nplace we could throw our own files\n\n565\n00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,260\nthat didn't require one of my computers\nto stay on all the time, right?\n\n566\n00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,158\nIs that, maybe we only have laptops,\nand every now and then I travel.\n\n567\n00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:47,190\nI don't wanna take all the files with\nme and nobody else can get to them.\n\n568\n00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:53,720\nSo, network attached storage, or\na NAS, is a box that does just that.\n\n569\n00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,380\nIt's basically a micro computer\nthat sits inside of a case and\n\n570\n00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,740\nthe case holds a bunch of hard drives.\n\n571\n00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,680\nAnd it plugs right into your network,\nand everybody on your network can\n\n572\n00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,370\naccess those files and\nthey don't depend on any other computer.\n\n573\n00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,170\nThere's a number of organizations\nthat are out there that make these.\n\n574\n00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,880\nOne of the ones we like are,\ns from a company called Drobo.\n\n575\n00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,982\nLet me just show you their website.\n\n576\n00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:16,769\nSo, these are the boxes they make.\n\n577\n00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,984\nAnd, and they start with their,\ntheir smaller, lower end ones.\n\n578\n00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:24,590\nRight?\nLike here's just the standard Drobo.\n\n579\n00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,470\nAnd then they move up to\nthe more expensive ones, and\n\n580\n00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,730\nnotice this guy over here,\nthe standard Drobo.\n\n581\n00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,120\nIt says storage type D-A-S, DAS.\n\n582\n00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,340\nThat's Direct Attached Storage.\n\n583\n00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,000\nThat means you take this,\nand it has a cable on it,\n\n584\n00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760\nand it plugs directly into\none of your computers.\n\n585\n00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,300\nAll right?\n\n586\n00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,352\nWe have one of these right here offset for\nour encoding machine.\n\n587\n00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,389\nWhen we record an episode that gets copied\nover to that machine, and it transcodes\n\n588\n00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,720\ninto all these different formats that you\nguys get to watch at the end of the day.\n\n589\n00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,970\nWell, it needs a lot of storage.\n\n590\n00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,550\nAnd we didn't have enough room in\nthat machine for it, so we struck a,\n\n591\n00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,750\na Drobo on it, and so it's got this direct\nattached storage that it works with.\n\n592\n00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,060\nOn a positive side,\n\n593\n00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,170\nwith direct attached storage,\nthat machine gets very fast access to it.\n\n594\n00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,690\nOn a negative side,\nif anybody else wants to get to it,\n\n595\n00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,280\nthat computer does have to be on.\n\n596\n00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,720\nWe've gotta go through that\ncomputer to get to it.\n\n597\n00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,980\nSo, what about network attach storage?\n\n598\n00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,297\nWell, this guy doesn't\nhave a network adapter.\n\n599\n00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:29,018\nBut if I move up to the next level,\nthe, the Drobo 5N storage type NAS,\n\n600\n00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:31,640\nnetwork attached storage.\n\n601\n00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,717\nThis one, the regular Drobo,\nhas a USB cable, right?\n\n602\n00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:35,774\nUSB3.0.\n\n603\n00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:36,935\nSo it is nice and fast.\n\n604\n00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,340\nThis one on the other hand,\nhas an Ethernet cable.\n\n605\n00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,810\nIt plugs right into your network.\n\n606\n00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,641\nNow, everyone on your network can access\nfiles or you can set user accounts, right?\n\n607\n00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:49,565\nSo it's not like they have all access,\nunless you want it.\n\n608\n00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,637\nPeople can access those files, and\n\n609\n00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:54,548\nno particular computer has\nto be turned on for it.\n\n610\n00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:58,332\nThis is a stand alone independent device.\n\n611\n00:30:58,332 --> 00:30:59,516\nAnd that's pretty cool.\n\n612\n00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:03,786\nReally useful, cuz you might replace your\ncomputer, you might lose a computer, but\n\n613\n00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:05,575\nall your files are waiting in here.\n\n614\n00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,800\nNow they have more advanced ones that\ngo in for like enterprises and, and\n\n615\n00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,856\neven other things.\n\n616\n00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:14,390\nIn fact,\nthe one we have down there is this guy.\n\n617\n00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,700\nThe Drobo 5D cuz we used the thunderbolt\nfor the, the Mac connection.\n\n618\n00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,948\nSo that's,\nthat's the one that we've got offset.\n\n619\n00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:20,795\nBut we have another one.\n\n620\n00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,978\nWhere is our other one Ronnie?\n\n621\n00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:23,592\nIs it the, yep, this one.\n\n622\n00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,430\nGot it.\n\n623\n00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,896\nThis one has a connection called which is\na special connection that we can use for\n\n624\n00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:31,151\nservers and, and workstations to connect.\n\n625\n00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:35,366\nAnd it kinda tricks the system into\nthinking the hard drives are internal.\n\n626\n00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,975\nLike, actually installed in the machine,\nversus being out over the network.\n\n627\n00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:41,385\nSo, these are our pretty useful devices.\n\n628\n00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,095\nDrobo is just one example\nI wanted to show you guys.\n\n629\n00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:43,988\nThere's others out there.\n\n630\n00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:48,678\nYou know, QKnapp, Western Digital,\ntons of companies make storage like this.\n\n631\n00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:49,456\nAlright.\n\n632\n00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:52,729\nBut direct attached storage\nrequires a computer to be on.\n\n633\n00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,320\nIt's directly connected to a computer.\n\n634\n00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,580\nAnd that one computer can then\nshare it out as it, as it sees fit.\n\n635\n00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,216\nNetwork attached to plugs\nright into the network,\n\n636\n00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:07,520\neverybody can You can see it regardless\nwhat computers are turned on.\n\n637\n00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,190\nAlright, another option we have are just\nstraight up external hard drives.\n\n638\n00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,490\nThese boxes here can be\na little bit expensive,\n\n639\n00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,130\ncuz they basically got a,\na computer built into them, right.\n\n640\n00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,090\nBut maybe you don't need that.\n\n641\n00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,530\nTake my laptop, for example.\n\n642\n00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,500\nI like to back my laptop up.\n\n643\n00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,540\nI like to back it up to\nan external drive so\n\n644\n00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,100\nthat if I ever have a failure\non my laptop, I've got a backup.\n\n645\n00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,240\nBut I don't always have a,\na NAS around to back up to and\n\n646\n00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,150\nI, I don't want to deal with that at home.\n\n647\n00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,320\nI, it's just not worth it to me\nto spend the money to get a NAS.\n\n648\n00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,290\nSo instead I just bought\nan external hard drive.\n\n649\n00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,890\nRight?\n\n650\n00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,450\nLet me show you,\nwe'll do Western Digital here.\n\n651\n00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,335\nMine, actually I think\nmine is Western Digital.\n\n652\n00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:46,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, so\n\n653\n00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,010\nyeah I've got Western Digital's\npage pulled up and\n\n654\n00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,850\nthey have a product called a My Book\nwhich is actually not what I have.\n\n655\n00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,730\nBut, the My Book, it's a hard drive.\n\n656\n00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,910\nAnd a power supply and that's about it.\n\n657\n00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,030\nAnd then it plugs into your computer\nvia USB so you have access to it.\n\n658\n00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,620\nIf you want somebody else to have\naccess you just disconnect it and\n\n659\n00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,140\nattach it to their computer.\n\n660\n00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,240\nIt can only be attached to one computer at\na time and it gives you external storage.\n\n661\n00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,330\nA hard drive that's outside of your case.\n\n662\n00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,610\nIt's a quick and easy way to\nexpand the storage on your system.\n\n663\n00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,590\nI use one on my laptop.\n\n664\n00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,200\nWell actually, I have more than one.\n\n665\n00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,020\nI use one for backups, right, it's a\nsmaller Western Digital, I use another one\n\n666\n00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,420\nfor running virtual machines when\nwe do virtualization on the show.\n\n667\n00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,130\nI just don't have enough\nspace on my computer so\n\n668\n00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,320\nI have another external drive that I use\nfor that, so I use these all the time.\n\n669\n00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,590\nYou can, the negative is you got\nto tote around this extra drive so\n\n670\n00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,210\nyour laptop bag gets heavier and\nall of that.\n\n671\n00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,440\nBut, if you can do internal storage\nyou can get around that all right.\n\n672\n00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,170\nYou don't need external if you have\nroom to add drives internally.\n\n673\n00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,760\nBut on a laptop you rarely\nhave any extra room.\n\n674\n00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,100\n>> Yeah, the only drawback of the external\nhard drives is really the capacity.\n\n675\n00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,590\nSo you happen to do like I did.\n\n676\n00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,720\nThe very first one I,\nI ever owned was only like 100 gigabytes.\n\n677\n00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,510\nWell, it didn't take long before the,\nthe next ones that came out were, like,\n\n678\n00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,200\n320 and 500 gigs and by that point\nyou keep adding on more storage,\n\n679\n00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,010\nthat means you have to replace them.\n\n680\n00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,800\nThings like nazes and\nthe direct attach stores, some of them\n\n681\n00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,030\nGive you the ability to take out those\nolder hard drives and put newer ones in.\n\n682\n00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,280\nAnd so\nyou actually can grow your capacity.\n\n683\n00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,980\n>> Yeah and\nthese days the external drives you buy,\n\n684\n00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,730\nthey're the same hard drives\nas what you have internally.\n\n685\n00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,570\nSo if you have a small drive in your\nsystem you can actually get a much larger\n\n686\n00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,760\nexternal one.\n\n687\n00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,610\nMy back up drive my laptop, right?\n\n688\n00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,580\nSo in my laptop I've got a 512 gig SSD,\nso that's the amount of storage I have\n\n689\n00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,830\nin the laptop, but my back up drive\nhas a one terabyte regular SATA disc.\n\n690\n00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,365\nIt's not as Expensive but\nit's got more storage available.\n\n691\n00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,065\nCuz I wanna store than one backup.\n\n692\n00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,755\nAnd so it works perfectly.\n\n693\n00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,575\nSo you can expand that\nstorage real quickly.\n\n694\n00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,455\nOne word of caution with those.\n\n695\n00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:56,870\nIf you drop them, hard drives Aren't\nreally designed to be portable so\n\n696\n00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,020\nif you drop them, they usually will fail.\n\n697\n00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,210\nThey won't withstand much of a,\na drop at all.\n\n698\n00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,310\nIt doesn't, doesn't really take a foot of,\nof drop to, to impact one of those.\n\n699\n00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,980\nSo you do have to be a little\nbit careful with them.\n\n700\n00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,190\nIt's not really making things portable.\n\n701\n00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,180\nIt's just making it easier to expand.\n\n702\n00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,990\nAll right so those are some of the\ndifferent types of storage that we might\n\n703\n00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,410\nchoose to put our information on.\n\n704\n00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,835\nThere are even more ways to exchange data.\n\n705\n00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:24,915\nNow I mentioned something earlier.\n\n706\n00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,795\nI said you can use things\nlike Microsoft One Drive,\n\n707\n00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:33,235\nor Apple iCloud Drive, or\nAmazon Cloud Drive, or, or whatever.\n\n708\n00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:37,910\nYou can use these services to store your\ndata on And then all of your computers\n\n709\n00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,190\nwill have access regardless of where\never they are, and that is really cool.\n\n710\n00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,060\nBut you're trusting that other company,\nand\n\n711\n00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,630\nI said\" I don't trust other companies,\nI use my own system instead.\", right?\n\n712\n00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,170\nWell that's the next thing that CompTIA\nmentions, which is a Peer to Peer network.\n\n713\n00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,610\nPeer to Peer networks are ways that we\ncan share information between computers\n\n714\n00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,530\nthat is not dependent on any one computer.\n\n715\n00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,710\nAnd unfortunately when hear\nabout Peer to Peer networks\n\n716\n00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,480\nit's almost always relating to\nsoftware and video piracy, right?\n\n717\n00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,150\nThere are huge networks of people on the\ninternet that exchange illegal videos and\n\n718\n00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,670\nillegal software,\nall using Peer to Peer networks.\n\n719\n00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,490\nIf you heard of Napster what\n\n720\n00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:24,430\nEmule Morpheous there's been\na bunch of em over the years.\n\n721\n00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,532\n>> Kazaa was the only\nI remember [INAUDIBLE]\n\n722\n00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:28,587\n>> Kazaa, Limelight, now we,\n\n723\n00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,750\nwe just have straight up Bit Torrents,\nright.\n\n724\n00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,900\nAnd the BitTorrent protocol itself\nis actually fully legal and\n\n725\n00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,960\nextremely useful, but you can use\nit to share whatever you want and\n\n726\n00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,360\npeople are using it to share\na lot of illegal content.\n\n727\n00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,640\nIt's decentralized storage, there is\nno one person that's responsible for\n\n728\n00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,380\nthat storage It's whoever\nhas a copy of it.\n\n729\n00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,770\nAnd that makes it to where you can\nget fast download times and so on.\n\n730\n00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,660\nSo Peer to Peer networks can be used for\nillegal things, but we can use them for\n\n731\n00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,680\nlegal things too that\nare actually incredibly useful.\n\n732\n00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,930\nSo one of the products that I\nreally like and make use of\n\n733\n00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,540\nIs a product called BitTorrent Sync, and\nit's a little synchronization program.\n\n734\n00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,520\nYou can install it.\n\n735\n00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,390\nIt's free.\n\n736\n00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,300\nYou can run it on Windows, Mac, Linux.\n\n737\n00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,700\nIt runs on whatever, and you can have\na series of files on one computer, and\n\n738\n00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,950\nyou run BitTorrent Syncand it\ngenerates a secure key, and\n\n739\n00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,680\nyou take that key to your other\ncomputers and you put that key in.\n\n740\n00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,060\nAnd the machines will then\nsynchronize with each other.\n\n741\n00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,100\nNo one person is the master on this,\neverybody is equal, and\n\n742\n00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,340\nif one person changes the file,\nit synchronizes to everybody else.\n\n743\n00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,100\nSo all of the machines\nhave the exact same data.\n\n744\n00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,830\nAnd if you go out to another city, to\nanother country and you're in a hotel and\n\n745\n00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,910\nyou get a wireless connection\nit will build a secure\n\n746\n00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,940\nconnection to one of the other hosts and\ncontinue synchronizing the files.\n\n747\n00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,250\nSo you have access everywhere but\nyou control the system.\n\n748\n00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,780\nYou're not storing your\ndata on Microsoft servers,\n\n749\n00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,670\nor Google servers or Apple servers You're\nstoring the data on your own systems.\n\n750\n00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,170\nAnd your doing a peer to peer direct\nconnections between your machines\n\n751\n00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,200\nto synchronize the information, alright.\n\n752\n00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040\nThat's bit torrency.\n\n753\n00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,800\nIt's really neat and useful, it's fairly\nnew, it came out about a year ago and\n\n754\n00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,060\nthey've been king of revamping it and\nupdating it, so it's still in beta, but\n\n755\n00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,960\nthere are other solutions that are kind\nof mapped around this same idea.\n\n756\n00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,060\nBut, it's basically giving you\ncontrol of where the data is stored.\n\n757\n00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,970\nRight, that is incredibly useful.\n\n758\n00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,040\nThere's other types of peer to peer\nconnections too though that are far\n\n759\n00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,150\nless complicated than something like that,\nright,\n\n760\n00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,730\nlike, Ronny, what's one other quick ways\n>> Yup\n\n761\n00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,530\n>> I could give data to you.\n\n762\n00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,910\n>> Another way that we could also do this\n>> Is through the wireless connections\n\n763\n00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,970\nsuch as using, well, bluetooth,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n764\n00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,390\n>> Is one of the other connections.\n\n765\n00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,100\nBluetooth is very nice because if both\nmachines will support the protocol,\n\n766\n00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,030\nthey really will discover each other.\n\n767\n00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,710\nAnd we only have to share a pass key,\nand then we can connect and\n\n768\n00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,270\nshare files with each other.\n\n769\n00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,680\nSo that's another quick\nway to be able to do that.\n\n770\n00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,690\n>> Very easily.\n\n771\n00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,260\n>> Yeah, you see that one?\n\n772\n00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,990\nIf you've got like photos on your phone,\nyeah, on your cell phone.\n\n773\n00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,290\nYou took a bunch of pictures and you want\nto get them on to your laptop real quick.\n\n774\n00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,940\nWell, Bluetooth works great for that you\ncan, you can sync up with your desktop or\n\n775\n00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,490\nlaptop Transfer the files and off you go.\n\n776\n00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,210\nWe're starting to see other\ntechnologies like NFC in some phones,\n\n777\n00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,680\nnot, not all of them, a, and\nthere's other things too.\n\n778\n00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,930\nIn older systems you might\nhave even had infra-red.\n\n779\n00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,000\nDid you ever use infra-red Ryan?\n\n780\n00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,820\n>> I didn't.\n\n781\n00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,230\nOnly for a printer at one time.\n\n782\n00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,910\n>> And, and was it not the fastest,\nmost amazing?\n\n783\n00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,420\n>> It was awesome, yeah,\nit was incredibly fast.\n\n784\n00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,460\nEspecially if I was only three\nfeet away or Three inches away.\n\n785\n00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,630\n>> Yeah, infrared was really bad for\nthat stuff.\n\n786\n00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,910\nSo technologies like bluetooth\nwe're really spoiled with them.\n\n787\n00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,430\n>> We are.\n\n788\n00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,580\n>> They work really, really well.\n\n789\n00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,890\nThere are other options too\nthat are a little less popular.\n\n790\n00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,014\nSo for example, for\n\n791\n00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:43,928\na little while Microsoft was\npushing a particular type of cable.\n\n792\n00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,167\nIt was called\na Microsoft Easy Transfer Cable.\n\n793\n00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,909\nAnd several companies made them.\n\n794\n00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:53,171\nThis is one by Belkin, and for $30, which\nis a little pricey in my opinion, you can\n\n795\n00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:57,993\nget a cable that was a USB connection on\nboth ends, and you could plug it into two\n\n796\n00:39:57,993 --> 00:40:03,020\ncomputers at the same time and transfer\ndata quickly and easily between them.\n\n797\n00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,530\nAll right?\nIt was like a network in a box.\n\n798\n00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,500\nThere is all this built into this\ncable well, the main purpose for\n\n799\n00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,780\nthis was you just bought a new computer.\n\n800\n00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,740\nYou want to get your data\noff the old computer,\n\n801\n00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,380\nand onto the new computer\nas quickly as you can.\n\n802\n00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,070\nThis cable works out great for\nthat you plug it in,\n\n803\n00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,380\nand you can transfer all your data\nreally quickly between the systems.\n\n804\n00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,440\nBut, most people don't use these anymore,\nbecause we can just use a USB key or, or\n\n805\n00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,260\nsomething like that you pop a USB thumb\ndrive into one computer, copy your stuff\n\n806\n00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,670\nto it, pop it out, plug it into the next\ncomputer, and copy your stuff back in.\n\n807\n00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,494\nSo it's a lot easier to do that\nthan without these cables so\n\n808\n00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:37,398\nthese are not very popular.\n\n809\n00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,252\nYou don't see them a lot,\n\n810\n00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:43,903\nnow this would be a direct connection\nbetween the two computers.\n\n811\n00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:48,449\nAll right those are some of the basic\nones and under peer to peer they you know\n\n812\n00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:52,998\nthey talk about blue tooth, internet\nbased ones, like victorian sync and\n\n813\n00:40:52,998 --> 00:40:57,619\ndirect links like what we saw there\nwith with that easy transfer same thing\n\n814\n00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:02,770\nwith fire wire there are fire wire\ncables that will go system to system.\n\n815\n00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,330\nSo those are mostly the ways that\nwe deal with that, you know, you,\n\n816\n00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,440\nyou pick whatever works for you.\n\n817\n00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,980\nWhatever solution is\nthe best in your environment\n\n818\n00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,260\nthey really all kinda\nprovide the same result.\n\n819\n00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:12,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n820\n00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,150\nBeing able to share files,\nbeing able to store them.\n\n821\n00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,270\nBeing able to,\nget access all of the data that we have\n\n822\n00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,360\nis really essential in todays\ncomputing environment.\n\n823\n00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,610\nSo, you knowing about some of the basic\ntechnologies, understanding what you're\n\n824\n00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:29,550\ngonna encounter is actually a part of what\nNike Professional needs to learn about.\n\n825\n00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,050\nSo take a look,\nover this particular segment again.\n\n826\n00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,140\nMake sure that you, you do,\nkinda at least have a good grasp\n\n827\n00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,460\nof some of the different\ntechnologies out there for doing it.\n\n828\n00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,320\n>> Absolutely.\n\n829\n00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,230\nAnd, and really, this is the extent of the\nnetworking that's going to be covered on\n\n830\n00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,830\nthe exam if you wanna learn\nmore about this stuff, there's\n\n831\n00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,800\na Comptia Network Plus certification\nwhere we go in great depth and\n\n832\n00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,330\ndetail into all the various aspects of\nnetworking and you will learn a lot.\n\n833\n00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,230\nThere is a ton of information there.\n\n834\n00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,190\nBut at the fundamental level, we just need\nto understand what our options are and\n\n835\n00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,840\nwhat the pros and cons of each solution\ncan be, so that's just what we're seeing.\n\n836\n00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,890\nThat's all a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap it up right there, Ronny.\n\n837\n00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,880\nAnd, and this really does wrap up\nthe whole 4.0 networking section, so\n\n838\n00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,980\nyou know, we're pretty much ready to move\ninto that 5.0 Basic IT Literacy, which is\n\n839\n00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,700\nreally a big section for the exam, so\nI hope you guys stay tuned for that.\n\n840\n00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,490\nBut in the meantime, if you have\nquestions on anything that we

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,087\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:13,783\nThe fifth and final domain of CompTIA\nIT Fundamentals is basic IT Literacy,\n\n3\n00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:15,610\nand it's a doozy.\n\n4\n00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,640\nIt accounts for about 24% of the exam,\nso it's a huge portion of the exam, and\n\n5\n00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,230\nthat means this is a scenario\nwe really need to be familiar.\n\n6\n00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,920\nIt is also a conglomeration of\nall of the other objectives\n\n7\n00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,830\nkind of wrapped together into\nan actual applied principle.\n\n8\n00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,060\nSo what you're gonna\nsee are two main areas.\n\n9\n00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,390\nYou're gonna see a lot of terminology,\nright.\n\n10\n00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,190\nAcronyms and\nother information that's just kind of\n\n11\n00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,190\nthe language we use as we\ncommunication the IT world.\n\n12\n00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,720\nAnd second Concepts, right.\n\n13\n00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,770\nThe ideas and principles that we try,\nand follow as we do things.\n\n14\n00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,220\nAnd the objectives just break that up\nby the various tasks that we perform.\n\n15\n00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,990\nFor example the first objective is\nperform appropriate steps to set up\n\n16\n00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,470\na basic workstation.\n\n17\n00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,550\nSo what's involved with that?\n\n18\n00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,300\nGetting a computer out of the box,\n\n19\n00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,420\nplugging in its cables, powering it on,\nand getting it operational, right.\n\n20\n00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,530\nThat's our first objective.\n\n21\n00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,000\n>> Our second objective goes into\nexplaining the bet, basic methods,\n\n22\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,620\nI can't say it, for\nnavigating an operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,250\nEven though you and I may know how to get\naround an operating system, remember that\n\n24\n00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,120\nfrom an IT worker's perspective, you've\ngot to also be able to know, how to get\n\n25\n00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,240\naround it very quickly, also to be able to\nhelp other users get around it as well.\n\n26\n00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,100\nSo, we'll be taking a look at some of the\ndifferent methods, such as shortcuts, and\n\n27\n00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,230\nof course, using the mouse,\nsome of the touch screen ideas that,\n\n28\n00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,700\nthat we see with tablets and\nwith, with PCs.\n\n29\n00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,310\nSo, we'll see that all that in that\nparticular objective of making sure that\n\n30\n00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,560\nwe can navigate around, and get to every\nplace that we need to be able to get to.\n\n31\n00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,210\n>> In the third objective,\nwe'll see given a scenario,\n\n32\n00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,310\nimplement basic support concepts.\n\n33\n00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,640\nAnd this is,\nit really centers around a few things.\n\n34\n00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,160\nThe idea of troubleshooting,\nand supporting a system, but\n\n35\n00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,140\nalso just communicating with an end user\nto find information out about a problem.\n\n36\n00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,886\nThese are important skills that we have.\n\n37\n00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:07,510\nNot so much a technical as much\nas it is a communication skill\n\n38\n00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,200\nto get the information you need\nto be able to solve a problem.\n\n39\n00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,540\nSo, we'll also take a look at some of\nthe other things involved in supporting\n\n40\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,500\na computer infrastructure\nin the third objective.\n\n41\n00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,680\n>> In the fourth objective\nexplain basic backup concepts.\n\n42\n00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,610\nJust as what we mentioned before, and\n\n43\n00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,280\nwhich we want everybody to be\nable to do a couple of things\n\n44\n00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,900\nsuch as making sure that they can\nbrowse to the internet securely.\n\n45\n00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,020\nOne of the things we want to make\nsure is that everybody can also do\n\n46\n00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,460\nbackups on their computer data,\n\n47\n00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,370\nand it's one of the most essential\nelements that we can use in our computer.\n\n48\n00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,380\nTo really ensure that, if something were\nto happen to it we could restore our data.\n\n49\n00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,780\nSo we want to make sure that everybody has\nthat concept, and they know how to do, and\n\n50\n00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,850\nperform the basic backup.\n\n51\n00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,410\n>> And then the final objective\nis describe the importance and\n\n52\n00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,550\nimpact of various environmental and\nsafety concepts.\n\n53\n00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,690\nYou find that your average computer is a,\ni, if you really break it down, it's\n\n54\n00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,280\nlike a virtual death trap [LAUGH] and so,\nthere's a lot of toxic chemicals involved\n\n55\n00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,730\nin the creation of a computer, and that's\ngoing to impact how we dispose of them?\n\n56\n00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,040\nWhen you're done with a computer,\nwhen you no longer need it,\n\n57\n00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,600\nyou don't just throw them in the trash\nbecause of things like led, and ACRT, and\n\n58\n00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,860\nother components that are in the\nmotherboards that we have to worry about.\n\n59\n00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,890\nThe other thing, our electrical\ncharges and safety in handling.\n\n60\n00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,880\nYou can get shocked working on a computer.\n\n61\n00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,870\nAnd some of them,\nespecially like the old CRT monitors,\n\n62\n00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,310\ncan really, really do some damage.\n\n63\n00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,810\nSo we've gotta be careful with that.\n\n64\n00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,320\nWe've gotta understand the implications,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320\nWhat parts of our computer are dangerous?\n\n66\n00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,170\nWhat safety measures we can\ntake to protect ourselves?\n\n67\n00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,050\nAnd when it's time to\ndispose of a computer,\n\n68\n00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,130\nhow we can do that in an environmentally\nsound and safe manner?\n\n69\n00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,100\nAll right.\n\n70\n00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000\nSo real important stuff there.\n\n71\n00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,680\nThis section,\nthis final domain really is, it,\n\n72\n00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,430\nit's kind of a summary of what an entry\nlevel IT worker is going to be doing?\n\n73\n00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,100\nSo just taking all the first\nfour objectives, and\n\n74\n00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,800\nturning them more into a job role,\nmore of that function.\n\n75\n00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,240\nSo it's a lot of concepts in here,\nbut it is a very valuable section.\n\n76\n00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,700\nAnd it is basically a quarter of the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,230\nYou know, 24% so,\nit's a huge chunk of that exam.\n\n78\n00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,030\nAll right well, enough talking about it,\nlet's get into the episodes.\n\n79\n00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,451\nStay tuned,\nwe're gonna jump into the episodes next.\n\n80\n00:04:21,451

00:00:35,261\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,281\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,960\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,720\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,150\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,015\nAt least, for\nthe third time we're doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n10\n00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,230\nwe've actually got an extra host on\nset today, you might have noticed.\n\n11\n00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,870\n>> Yes.\n>> Our co-host today is this\n\n12\n00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,830\nDell workstation and it's all because\nwe're diving right back into CompTIA IT\n\n13\n00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,850\nfundamentals and the objective that\nwe're hitting is Objective 5.1,\n\n14\n00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,220\nperform appropriate steps to\nset up a basic workstation.\n\n15\n00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,020\nAnd what they're talking about is when you\nget a new computer, you get that brand\n\n16\n00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,140\nnew, a box shows up, somebody's gotta open\nit and put the thing together, right?\n\n17\n00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,160\nSo we're gonna run through\nwhat's involved in doing that.\n\n18\n00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,630\nThe initial setup of a computer and\ngetting it up and running and\n\n19\n00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,090\nwe've gotta start with a box that's not\nplugged in that has no cables on it and\n\n20\n00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,420\nnormally we use our v-labs.\n\n21\n00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,450\n>> Right.\n>> And things during the show.\n\n22\n00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,730\nBut it's hard to do a v-lab from\na machine that's not even plugged in.\n\n23\n00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,863\nSo we are starting with\nthe super basics and\n\n24\n00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:34,120\nwe're gonna go through what you need to\ndo to get that computer up and running.\n\n25\n00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,650\n>> Yeah, Don, do you even remember\nthat first computer that you\n\n26\n00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,830\nended up buying and it came in that\nbox the size of a small Honda Civic?\n\n27\n00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,770\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That you had to kinda bring out and\n\n28\n00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,550\nthat first smell and\n\n29\n00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,800\nyou're like oh this is what a brand new\ncomputer is supposed to smell like.\n\n30\n00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,450\nWell that's what we're\nreally talking about,\n\n31\n00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,110\nis going through the experience of making\nsure that we have fun setting it up.\n\n32\n00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,560\nBut that we can actually\ndo it consistently and\n\n33\n00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,410\nof course, be able to do it correctly.\n\n34\n00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,840\nAnd so\nwe want to make sure that we understand\n\n35\n00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,660\nall of the different cables that we're\ngonna be putting into this thing.\n\n36\n00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,620\n>> Yeah, now we've already done\naway with the cardboard box and\n\n37\n00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,750\nall the packing peanuts and Styrofoam.\n\n38\n00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,400\nWe've tossed all that stuff but\nwhat's left are a lot\n\n39\n00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,360\nof different components that we have\nto go through getting hooked up.\n\n40\n00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,710\nFortunately, with today's\ncomputers it's pretty easy.\n\n41\n00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,830\nMost of the cables cannot be mixed up,\nthere's a few exceptions but\n\n42\n00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,960\nmost of them can't.\n\n43\n00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,270\nAnd almost everything is color\ncoded on modern computers.\n\n44\n00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,310\nFor the exam though, we do need to be\naware of these basic steps to get it set\n\n45\n00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,960\nup and you don't wanna rely on\nsimple things like colors when\n\n46\n00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,790\nthey may not actually carry\nthrough in real life.\n\n47\n00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,830\nSo let's get started.\n\n48\n00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,470\nWell, the first thing we do when we get\na new computer is we unpack everything and\n\n49\n00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,760\nmake sure we've got our\nnecessary components.\n\n50\n00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,670\nBut if you're really new to this,\n\n51\n00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,240\nyou might not know what\nall of the components are.\n\n52\n00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,740\nSo at a minimum, we're looking for\nfour basic things.\n\n53\n00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,560\nThere's the desktop itself, this big tower\nthat is gonna contain everything we need,\n\n54\n00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,600\nnow, this one is big, you might have\na smaller one, different sizes and\n\n55\n00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,810\nshapes, right, but you're going to have\nthis main box that contains the CPU,\n\n56\n00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,340\nmotherboard, memory,\nall that other good stuff, all right?\n\n57\n00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,940\nThen, you're going to have a keyboard and\na mouse, right?\n\n58\n00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,410\nYou've got to be able to interact with\nthe computer, and the keyboard and\n\n59\n00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,240\nthe mouse are what does that, and\nI know I've got ours kind of back here,\n\n60\n00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,790\nwe'll see how much stuff I can drop.\n\n61\n00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,520\nSo I've got a, a big box here that is\nroughly the shape of a keyboard and\n\n62\n00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,120\nit's got a little picture\nof a keyboard on there so\n\n63\n00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,670\nI'm pretty sure that's what it is,\nbut I haven't opened it.\n\n64\n00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,685\nProbably would've been a good idea\nto do that before the show but\n\n65\n00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:27,815\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n66\n00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:32,211\nAnd, maybe it'll be like when Geraldo\n[CROSSTALK] opened up Al Capone's vault or\n\n67\n00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:32,867\nwhatever.\n\n68\n00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,554\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So then we got a nice little mouse\n\n69\n00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:40,102\nthat's in our wrapper here so\nit is an interesting mouse.\n\n70\n00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:44,802\nSo we've got some of that and the fourth\ncomponent that we need is a monitor.\n\n71\n00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,432\nThis whole thing is not\ngonna be very useful to us\n\n72\n00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,452\nunless we can see what's going on,\non the computer.\n\n73\n00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,622\nSo we've got our monitor right here.\n\n74\n00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,970\nNow the only problem is.\n\n75\n00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,490\nNone of this stuff comes hooked up.\n\n76\n00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,930\nThere's a lot of cables.\n\n77\n00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,460\nSo in addition to these components,\n\n78\n00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,720\nI've got all these other little cables\nlaying around and all sorts of junk here.\n\n79\n00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,910\nSo we gotta figure out what goes\nwhere to get this system set up.\n\n80\n00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,460\nSo that's where we're going to start.\n\n81\n00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,090\nAnd let's just start with\nsome of our main components.\n\n82\n00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,780\nNow, one of the things that I\nlike to hook up first is power.\n\n83\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,850\nNow, one of the last things we'll do\nis actually power this unit on, so\n\n84\n00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,340\nwhy do I hook that up first?\n\n85\n00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,860\nWell, the power cables are usually\nnever as long as I want them to be.\n\n86\n00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,770\nAnd they're also pretty thick cables,\nso they can be\n\n87\n00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,000\na bit of a burden to run sometimes\nthat's why I normally start there.\n\n88\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,680\nYou'll normally have two power cables and\nthat's for the computer and the monitor.\n\n89\n00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,730\n>> Yeah, without the power cables,\nnone of this stuff is gonna work.\n\n90\n00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,360\nSo a lot of times when you have a monitor\nand you have the computer tower itself and\n\n91\n00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,750\neven extra peripherals,\n\n92\n00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,530\nyou may actually make sure that\nyou have enough power cables.\n\n93\n00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,905\nBut also, what we also normally end up\ngetting is something like power strip too,\n\n94\n00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:58,325\nthat we can plug all things\ninto a single outlet location.\n\n95\n00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,955\n>> Now, most of the cables that you\nget today are gonna be wrapped up in\n\n96\n00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:04,000\ntwist ties like garbage twist ties or\nwhatever.\n\n97\n00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,880\nAnd you can take them off and\ntoss them now.\n\n98\n00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,720\nYou just throw them in the trash but\nI usually save them and\n\n99\n00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,327\nnot just because I'm some\nkind of weird pack rat.\n\n100\n00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:10,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n101\n00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,020\nbecause, we can use these\na little bit later in our set-up.\n\n102\n00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,200\nYou might have noticed in\nCompTIA exam objectives,\n\n103\n00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,792\nthey mention basic cable management.\n\n104\n00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,610\nWe're gonna run a lot of cables here and\nit can create a mess.\n\n105\n00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,640\nAnd so, you can save these little twist\nties that are wrapped around the cable and\n\n106\n00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,590\nyou can use these to help\nclean up your cables.\n\n107\n00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,630\nGet them all kind of wrapped together and\nnice and neat.\n\n108\n00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,060\nSo I usually hold onto those.\n\n109\n00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,250\nSo I'm just gonna unhook these twist\nties and set them to the side.\n\n110\n00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,890\nWe'll see some other\ncable manage options too.\n\n111\n00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,290\nBut for right now,\nI'm just unbundling these cables and\n\n112\n00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,680\nthen I'll stretch them out.\n\n113\n00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,795\nAnd these are nice and.\n\n114\n00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:44,574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Brand new.\n\n115\n00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:45,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,350\n>> Yeah, kinked all over the place.\n\n117\n00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,344\nAs the cable sits out\nit'll straighten out.\n\n118\n00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:52,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It has a cable memory to it so\n\n119\n00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,240\nit remembers the position\nit used to be in.\n\n120\n00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,752\nSo it'll straighten out, but\nthe first time you open it.\n\n121\n00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's kind of a mess.\n\n122\n00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,640\nSo, we're gonna get these connected now.\n\n123\n00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,170\nFortunately, power cables are one of\nthose ones that are extremely difficult\n\n124\n00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,010\nto mix up.\n\n125\n00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,100\nLet's take a look at\nwhere we hook this up.\n\n126\n00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,290\nAll right, now, we can spot the network\ncable connect, I mean the power.\n\n127\n00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,100\nSee, I don't even know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n128\n00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,530\nWe can hook up the power cable\nconnector pretty easily,\n\n129\n00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,560\nbecause it's going to be the only\nD-plug in our entire system.\n\n130\n00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,510\nIt's got these three holes in it, and\nso you can kinda just look around and\n\n131\n00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,890\ntry and\nfind the only plug that matches that.\n\n132\n00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,110\nNow on this particular computer, the power\nconnector's right up here at the top.\n\n133\n00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,340\nDon't always count on that,\nsome systems sits down on the bottom.\n\n134\n00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,790\nThis one is turned sideways, other\ntimes it might be turned horizontally.\n\n135\n00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,000\nIt can be in different positions, but\nthe connector is always the same.\n\n136\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,850\nAnd it's regardless of\nwhat country you're in,\n\n137\n00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,280\nif you're in the U.S.,\nif you're in Canada, if you're in France,\n\n138\n00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,380\nif you're in Russia it, it's all the same,\nthey all use the same connector.\n\n139\n00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,270\nIt's the other end of the cable that\nmay be different, so here in the U.S.\n\n140\n00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,750\nI've got this three-prong\ngrounded polarized connector.\n\n141\n00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,390\nSo that's what we have here, but\n\n142\n00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,980\nin your country you may have\na different connector on that end.\n\n143\n00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,460\nSo that's gonna go into your wall socket,\nbut\n\n144\n00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,600\nour D-plug we'll just take that and\nplug it right in.\n\n145\n00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,340\nAnd it does require just a little bit\nof force there to get it in place.\n\n146\n00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,930\nThere we go and\nnow I've got my power cable plugged in.\n\n147\n00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,360\nNow, I'm not actually gonna plug\nit in to the wall just yet.\n\n148\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,650\nAnd that's because I'm still\nconnecting other cables and\n\n149\n00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,680\nI don't wanna accidentally turn the system\non while I'm plugging other things in.\n\n150\n00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,140\nSo I'm just gonna leave that unplugged for\nnow.\n\n151\n00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,450\nI need to do the same thing\non the monitor, right?\n\n152\n00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,060\nAnd Ronnie, can you do me a favor,\n\n153\n00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,240\nlet's see if we can turn that monitor\nhere to the side of the computer.\n\n154\n00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,670\n>> We may even be able to actually\nremove it from the stand.\n\n155\n00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,480\n>> Oh, even better, look at that.\n\n156\n00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,300\n>> And make it easier.\n\n157\n00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,030\n>> Now,\nI'm actually glad you did that Ronnie,\n\n158\n00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,710\nbecause the monitor will\ntypically come in its own box.\n\n159\n00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,620\nAnd to make the box smaller,\na lot of times they will remove the stand.\n\n160\n00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,230\nAnd that's what Ronnie just did,\nyou got the monitor.\n\n161\n00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,912\nLet me hold this up.\n\n162\n00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:03,531\nSo here's the stand that monitor goes\non and it's just a standard base but\n\n163\n00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,552\nthis one has a couple of little.\n\n164\n00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,271\nTabs.\n\n165\n00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:09,127\nAnd so that just pops right\ninto the back of the monitor.\n\n166\n00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:11,470\nYour monitor may or\nmay not have a removable stand,\n\n167\n00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,160\nsometimes they have screws.\n\n168\n00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,580\nI'm kinda surprised on this one it doesn't\neven have screws, it just pops in,\n\n169\n00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,830\nso that's.\n\n170\n00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,650\n>> And locks in place.\n\n171\n00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,390\n>> Yeah, a little locking button.\n\n172\n00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,420\nSo he was able to just\npop that off real quick,\n\n173\n00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,249\nbut that's another thing\nyou might encounter.\n\n174\n00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,710\nBut we've got a number of connectors\non the bottom of that monitor and\n\n175\n00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,470\nlet's turn it sideways and set it right\nhere so it'll be in our other camera shot.\n\n176\n00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,130\nSo here's the bottom of that monitor and\n\n177\n00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,150\nyou can see the video connections\nthat are down here and\n\n178\n00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,390\nup here I've got a D-plug that\nlooks just like on the computer.\n\n179\n00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,640\nMost of your monitors are gonna have\na D-plug like that but not all of them.\n\n180\n00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,300\nSome monitors have a proprietary\nlike there usually be a circle or\n\n181\n00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,470\nthey call it a barrel connector for power.\n\n182\n00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,350\nSo you might have something different, but\n\n183\n00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,830\nmost of the ones today\nhave that standard D-plug.\n\n184\n00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,760\nI'm just gonna go and\nplug this one in and give it a go.\n\n185\n00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,530\nSo, let's see, it's way over here and so\n\n186\n00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,080\nI'll just give that a little bit\nof force and put it in there.\n\n187\n00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,960\nIt does require some force to\nget these cables connected.\n\n188\n00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,250\nAnd so you can kinda give it a tug\nto make sure it's in there securely.\n\n189\n00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,860\nBut no screws or anything,\nyou just push it right in.\n\n190\n00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,000\nAll right, so that takes care of power.\n\n191\n00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,714\nWhat's next, Ronnie?\n\n192\n00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:26,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was trying to balance it here.\n\n193\n00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,813\n>> Yeah, yeah, try to balance it here.\n\n194\n00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:29,448\nYeah, so once we have the power in,\n\n195\n00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,940\nwe can now begin to connect in some\nof the other peripherals, right?\n\n196\n00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,220\nSo we can either pick the keyboard or\nthe mouse or\n\n197\n00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,930\nwe can even go ahead and try and\nconnect maybe even the monitor back in.\n\n198\n00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,810\n>> Let's do the monitor, so\n\n199\n00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,298\nthat we can put it back on its stand and\nget it out of our way.\n\n200\n00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:48,030\nSo the monitor, let's take a look at\nthe bottom of that monitor again.\n\n201\n00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,400\nThis monitor actually has two\ndifferent video connectors.\n\n202\n00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,670\nIs that three?\n\n203\n00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,450\n>> Two.\n\n204\n00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,450\n>> It is not uncommon for\nmonitors to have more than one connectors.\n\n205\n00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,780\nAnd what they're doing\nis giving you options.\n\n206\n00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,770\nHere, I can connect my VGA or DVI.\n\n207\n00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,470\nYour monitor might have HDMI.\n\n208\n00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,380\nIt might have display port,\n\n209\n00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,650\nright there is a few different\nconnector types you can get.\n\n210\n00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,590\nFor the most part just for basic video it\ndoesn't really matter which one we pick\n\n211\n00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,580\nbut there is different quality levels for\neach one.\n\n212\n00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,810\nVGA is the most compatible but\nit's gonna give us the lowest quality.\n\n213\n00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,930\nDVI is digital,\nit'll gives us better quality, but\n\n214\n00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,069\nit doesn't perform as well\non higher resolution.\n\n215\n00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,230\nHDMI, if we had it would be even better\nbecause HDMI can move sound too.\n\n216\n00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,100\nIf your monitor has built-in\nspeakers HDMI will pull that in.\n\n217\n00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,250\nSo, if we had HDMI,\nI'd normally kind of prefer that.\n\n218\n00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,520\nAnd then display port is nice to have\nbecause it's a native video solution.\n\n219\n00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,580\nSo you might have display\nport out on your computer and\n\n220\n00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,280\ndisplay port in on the monitor.\n\n221\n00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,240\nAnd you can get some really\nhigh-resolution as well as multiple\n\n222\n00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,480\nmonitor support.\n\n223\n00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,640\nSo, whichever one you have, you need to\ntry and pick the best one, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,750\nNow, when I look at\nthe back of this monitor,\n\n225\n00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,830\nI can see that it's got those DVI and\nVGA connectors.\n\n226\n00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,380\nSo I need to look at\nthe back of my computer and\n\n227\n00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,850\nfigure out which one we've got there.\n\n228\n00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,150\nSo, let's look at the back of this PC and\nsee what we got.\n\n229\n00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,330\n>> Now here on the back of the PC we\nactually see two different ports for\n\n230\n00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,920\nthe monitor itself.\n\n231\n00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,950\nAnd so when you take look you actually\nsee one that's labeled in blue but\n\n232\n00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,000\nit's actually got a nice cover on\nit right there in the dark blue.\n\n233\n00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400\nAnd I can't point it, there you go.\n\n234\n00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,210\n>> All right, so right here, yep.\n\n235\n00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,130\nSo, a VGA port, we can see over\nhere is that dark blue, and\n\n236\n00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,090\nwe find this match,\nit's got a cover on it.\n\n237\n00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,670\nAnd if I pop that off,\nI can see there's the VGA port, right?\n\n238\n00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,110\nIt's not uncommon for them to stick\ncovers on the ports to protect them, but\n\n239\n00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,140\nthis cover's a little weird.\n\n240\n00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,430\n>> Notice that it's got\na circle with a slash on it.\n\n241\n00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,571\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's got the no-no mark on it.\n\n242\n00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:51,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And why would they do that, Ronnie?\n\n243\n00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,120\n>> Yeah, the reason why they're doing\nthat is because this particular computer\n\n244\n00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,350\ncomes with an additional\nvideo adapter card and\n\n245\n00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,420\nthat card is one that we got\nbecause it supported dual monitors.\n\n246\n00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,340\nSo it's trying to let us know right away\nthat if we were to go ahead and unbox this\n\n247\n00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,470\nthing and wanted to connect the actual\nmonitor, it's saying don't use this one.\n\n248\n00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,810\nUse the additional card instead.\n\n249\n00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,800\nSo they put that symbol on there just to\nmake sure that we know that we're not\n\n250\n00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,570\nsupposed to use this one by default.\n\n251\n00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,470\nSo the other one's actually toward\nthe bottom end of this computer instead.\n\n252\n00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,890\n>> Yeah, so if you've got\nan additional video card put in,\n\n253\n00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,210\nyou'll see it down here in your PCI slots.\n\n254\n00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,930\nAnd so sure enough,\nI could spot one right here.\n\n255\n00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,740\nNow when I look at that card,\nit's got a cover on it also, so\n\n256\n00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,210\nI'm gonna pop that off.\n\n257\n00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,000\nAnd I can see I've got some\nkind of proprietary connection.\n\n258\n00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,780\nI don't actually know what that is.\n\n259\n00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,770\nAnd then beside it,\nI've got what looks like a DVI connection.\n\n260\n00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,560\nBut it's not actually a DVI connector,\nit does kinda look like it, it's white.\n\n261\n00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,040\nIt's got a bunch of pins in it.\n\n262\n00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,710\nBut, look at the amount of pins there,\nversus the amount of pins over here.\n\n263\n00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,830\nThose two look very, very different.\n\n264\n00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,450\nAnd the DVI connector up here,\nit's got that little slot, or dash,\n\n265\n00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,770\nkind of on the side.\n\n266\n00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,330\nThis guy doesn't have that at all.\n\n267\n00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,660\nRight, I mean,\nit's got a little one pin missing, but\n\n268\n00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660\nthe rest of it doesn't\nlook like that at all.\n\n269\n00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,980\nAnd the reason is, this is a combo port,\n\n270\n00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,840\nthis is actually two video ports\ncombined into one interface.\n\n271\n00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,030\nSo, computers that have cards like these\nwill usually use what's called a dongle.\n\n272\n00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,820\nAnd Dell in this case opted to go this\nmode because what they did is they\n\n273\n00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,580\nknew some customers would want VGA,\nsome customers would want DVI.\n\n274\n00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,150\nSo by doing this interface,\n\n275\n00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,270\nthey could give us different dongles and\nleave the choice up to us.\n\n276\n00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,195\nRight, and do we\n>> Yep\n\n277\n00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,120\n>> Have those dongles?\n\n278\n00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,745\nOh you've got them right.\n\n279\n00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:39,370\n>> Yeah, I've got one and\n\n280\n00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,070\nI think the other one we dropped\noff the camera for right now.\n\n281\n00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,450\nBut a dongle has of course\na single connector that\n\n282\n00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,560\ngoes into that proprietary port.\n\n283\n00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,430\nAnd then notice it splits off into\ntwo different connectors for us.\n\n284\n00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,730\nSo that we can actually hook up\ndual monitors if we need to.\n\n285\n00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,050\nSo, part of the video card, of course,\nis to be able to do that, and\n\n286\n00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,790\nthen we also need this dongle.\n\n287\n00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,210\nMost of the time, when you do go ahead and\norder an extra video card.\n\n288\n00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,700\nHopefully, you will have this dongle.\n\n289\n00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,140\nIf not, you end up seeing that what\nyou'll need is to get one of these.\n\n290\n00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,550\nNow I have the one for the DVI connection,\n\n291\n00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,880\nwhich is probably the one\nthat we will need to use.\n\n292\n00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,630\nBut what if I only have monitors,\nthough, that will support VGA?\n\n293\n00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,270\nThe good thing is they do\nhave those dongles and\n\n294\n00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,970\nwhat Don was talking about was the ability\nto actually take that single end, and\n\n295\n00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,930\nto be able to connect it to different\ntypes of output monitors for us.\n\n296\n00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,840\nSo here's the one that I have for\nthe VGA too.\n\n297\n00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,945\nSo that again allows me to have two\ndifferent monitors to support it.\n\n298\n00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:39,690\n>> Yeah, when you hook these up, you just\npick which one's appropriate for you.\n\n299\n00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,360\nAnd if you go VGA,\ndon't throw the DVI dongle away.\n\n300\n00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,100\nSave it, because right now you might\nonly have monitors that do VGA but\n\n301\n00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,240\ndown the road you might\npurchase new monitors.\n\n302\n00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,820\nAnd they might have DVI,\nit'd be nice to able to switch\n\n303\n00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,090\nback without having to go and\nfind a new dongle.\n\n304\n00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,100\nSo, In this case I got a choice.\n\n305\n00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,370\nMy monitor supports DVI,\nmy computer supports DVI,\n\n306\n00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,950\nDVI would give me the best quality here,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,675\nSo I might be ready to go and\nsay let's go DVI.\n\n308\n00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:11,280\nBut there's one more thing I need,\nwhich is a cable to hook this up.\n\n309\n00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,140\nI gotta run a cable from\nthe computer to the monitor.\n\n310\n00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,940\nSo, let's look at our\ninventory here Ronnie.\n\n311\n00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,070\nWhat video cable do we have?\n\n312\n00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,429\n>> Well,\nthe video cable that came with default.\n\n313\n00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,650\n>> Mystery cable.\n\n314\n00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,880\n>> It is actually one of these, and it's\ncovered so that we're not exactly sure.\n\n315\n00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,130\nSo if I reveal the actual mystery here,\nI know it's exciting, isn't it?\n\n316\n00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,030\nIt is actually just a VGA cable.\n\n317\n00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,042\n>> Lame, all right.\n\n318\n00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,550\n>> So\nsometimes what ends up happening is that\n\n319\n00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,340\nyou might end up getting\na system which has both.\n\n320\n00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,890\nSometimes it may just be one like this.\n\n321\n00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,820\nAnd maybe on economy class computers\nthat's what ends up happening is they\n\n322\n00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,750\nonly ship one.\n\n323\n00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,320\n>> Yeah, so if we wanna hook up,\nwell, first off,\n\n324\n00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,150\nif we wanna hook up a second monitor\nwe're gonna have to buy a new cable.\n\n325\n00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,226\n>> Right.\n>> But the other thing is,\n\n326\n00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,163\nif we wanna go DVI,\nwe're gonna have to go buy a new cable.\n\n327\n00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:55,311\nNow I know we've got some DVI\ncables here at the officer, but\n\n328\n00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,807\nI don't have one right now.\n\n329\n00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,919\nWe can always change it later, right?\n\n330\n00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,244\n>> Right.\n>> So, it's not a big deal.\n\n331\n00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:05,027\nWe'll go ahead and hook up vga now\nknowing that we can always upgrade later.\n\n332\n00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,734\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> All right, so, let's go ahead and\n\n333\n00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:07,775\nget this one hooked up, and\n\n334\n00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,150\nthen we'll be able to stick this\nmonitor back on it's stand.\n\n335\n00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,540\nNow, notice that cable shipped with like\nsome styrofoam wrapper on the connector,\n\n336\n00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,860\nand there's plastic covers on both ends,\nand the reason is there's a lot of little\n\n337\n00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,960\npins in there, and they don't want any of\nthe pins getting bent during shipping,\n\n338\n00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,800\nso to help eliminate that return, they\nput these covers on there to protect it.\n\n339\n00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,670\nSo, make sure you remove those covers\nbefore you try and attach them, or\n\n340\n00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,805\nyou won't get very far.\n\n341\n00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,950\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\n>> I've done that.\n\n342\n00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,570\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,490\nSo, I'm going to start,\nit doesn't matter which end we start on,\n\n344\n00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,000\nI'll start on the computer side.\n\n345\n00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,110\nNow, I could attach to the built-in\nVGA but on a lot of these\n\n346\n00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,300\ncomputers when they put a cover, what that\nmeans is that the adding card is actually\n\n347\n00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,480\ndisabled this interface and this interface\nwont work unless I take this card out.\n\n348\n00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,550\nSo, even though I'm doing a single\nmonitor, I do want to attach down here,\n\n349\n00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,990\nand since I've got VGA, I'm going to grab\nthat VGA dongle, so I'm just gonna take\n\n350\n00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,880\nthis guy, and you'll see its got the,\nthe same pin layout as the card down here.\n\n351\n00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,510\nNow, this card is not\nmanufactured by Dell.\n\n352\n00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,330\nI think this is actually an ATI card and\nATI\n\n353\n00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:18,570\nis a video card manufacturer and they\ngot bought out a while back ago by AMD.\n\n354\n00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,840\nSo, the same people that make AMD\nprocessors make this video card.\n\n355\n00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,647\nAll right, Ryan,\nyou got that monitor for a second?\n\n356\n00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,500\n>> I do.\n>> Free up a second hand.\n\n357\n00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,410\nNow, that dongle hand thumbscrews\non it and anytime you have\n\n358\n00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,490\nthumbscrews on a connector,\nyou might be tempted to use a screwdriver,\n\n359\n00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,220\nor a coin to really tighten these down,\ndon't.\n\n360\n00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,600\nYou just want to attach the connector and\nhand-tighten it.\n\n361\n00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,315\nTighten it by hand.\n\n362\n00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,285\nGet that one connected in place.\n\n363\n00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,855\nAll right, the reason they have\nthose little notches on there is for\n\n364\n00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,065\nwhen you remove it.\n\n365\n00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,685\nIt can be difficult to remove them, but\n\n366\n00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,355\nyou never want to torque\nit down using that adaptor.\n\n367\n00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,267\nAll right, next,\nI need to attach my VGA J-cable.\n\n368\n00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,117\nBut I've got two connectors,\nwhich do I connect?\n\n369\n00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,087\nWell, whenever you have dongles like this,\n\n370\n00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:08,887\nthey almost always take the time\nto write some numbers on there.\n\n371\n00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,237\nIf I turn these just right,\nyou should be able to see it.\n\n372\n00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,947\nOne of them has a number one and\nthe other has a number two.\n\n373\n00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:15,987\nAnd that's telling me monitor one and\nmonitor two.\n\n374\n00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,343\nWell normally,\nwhen I put these side-by-side,\n\n375\n00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:21,457\nnumber one would be on the left,\nnumber two would be on the right.\n\n376\n00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:23,180\nSo, it's helping us to identify that.\n\n377\n00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,590\nI've only got one monitor so\nI'm gonna hook up to number one.\n\n378\n00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,270\nAll right?\n\n379\n00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,200\nSo, this's gonna be a number one.\n\n380\n00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,220\nAll right.\n\n381\n00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,270\nAnd I'm just gonna do the same\nthing I did a moment ago.\n\n382\n00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,400\nI'm, I'm squeezing the cable on there, and\nI'm just gonna thumb tighten these screws,\n\n383\n00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,220\njust with my fingers,\nno special tools or anything.\n\n384\n00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,170\nI don't want to go too tight.\n\n385\n00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,320\nI'm trying to make sure it doesn't come\nundone on it's own, and they're pretty\n\n386\n00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,240\nsecure, you know it would be hard for\nthat to come undone, and there we go.\n\n387\n00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,120\nThe other end of my cable, we're just\ngonna take that up to our monitor and\n\n388\n00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,730\nlet's see,\nwe've got our monitor right here, so\n\n389\n00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,080\nwe'll run to that one and\nonly one place that it can go.\n\n390\n00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,560\nRemember the VGA, the sides are tapered,\n\n391\n00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,290\nit's kind of a trapezoid so\nyou can't attach it upside down.\n\n392\n00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,930\nIf you're doing this blind, like if\nyou have the computer standing up and\n\n393\n00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,410\nyou're trying to plug in from\nunderneath where you can't see,\n\n394\n00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,080\nsometimes you'll come in upside down and\nyou've just got to turn it over, so\n\n395\n00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,760\nI'll take this one and flip it around.\n\n396\n00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560\nSo, am I holding it upside down?\n\n397\n00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,390\nI think I am holding it upside down.\n\n398\n00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,000\nI'm actually trying to do\nthis where I can see but\n\n399\n00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,210\nI'm seeing through one of our\nstudio monitors It's turning\n\n400\n00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,982\nup to be a little more challenging than\nI thought it would be, there we go.\n\n401\n00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,770\nAll right, so, I'm just gonna push that\non there and then same process here,\n\n402\n00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:41,420\nI'm just gonna thumb screw that one in and\nthere we go, so.\n\n403\n00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,310\nYou know, David, we might,\nmight have different card,\n\n404\n00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,710\nDavid in the chatroom mentioned he's got\none just like this but it's an Nvidia.\n\n405\n00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,050\nThis one's actually an ATI Radeon.\n\n406\n00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,640\nX1300 or 1600?\n\n407\n00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think it's a X1600.\n\n408\n00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,515\n>> 1600.\n>> So, yeah, this one, this one's an ATI.\n\n409\n00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:58,790\nSo, that split dongle connector is,\nis not proprietary.\n\n410\n00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,820\nThat's something that,\nthat anybody can make use of.\n\n411\n00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,000\nSo it's,\nit's one that you'll see from ATI, Nvidia.\n\n412\n00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,875\nSeveral different places\nuse that same connector.\n\n413\n00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n414\n00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,160\nAll right.\nSo, my monitor now has power and\n\n415\n00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,350\nit's got video, and\nthat's being run to my desktop.\n\n416\n00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,200\nSo my desktop has that video.\n\n417\n00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,090\nAnd it's got power.\n\n418\n00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,000\nAnd that's the last thing I\nneed to hook up to the monitor.\n\n419\n00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,180\nThere are some monitors that\nhave built in speakers.\n\n420\n00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,580\nAnd if we have built in speakers there\nmight be an audio cable to attach.\n\n421\n00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,920\nAnd on really new computers\nyou might have a touchscreen.\n\n422\n00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,660\nAnd if there's a touchscreen,\nthere's typically a USB cable to attach.\n\n423\n00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,370\nSo, if you have other cables on\nyour monitor they'll need to be\n\n424\n00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,040\nplugged in, too.\n\n425\n00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,200\nWe're gonna do separate speakers here\nin a minute so we'll hold off on that.\n\n426\n00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,970\nAnd this one doesn't have a touchscreen,\nbut if it was,\n\n427\n00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,510\nyou'd just plug it into any\nof the available USB ports.\n\n428\n00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,630\nSo, Ronnie, let's,\nlet's throw this back on its stand.\n\n429\n00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,680\nAnd you got that?\n\n430\n00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,450\n>> Yup, sure do.\n\n431\n00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,066\n>> We'll get that out of the way.\n\n432\n00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:58,700\nAll right so, of our four key\ncomponents we've got our monitor and\n\n433\n00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,790\nour desktop tower set up,\nnow we need our keyboard and mouse.\n\n434\n00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,990\nEverything after that is kind\nof icing on the cake, right?\n\n435\n00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,900\nThe keyboard and mouse we're,\nwe're probably gonna need.\n\n436\n00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,983\nSo let's,\nlet's take a look at some of those.\n\n437\n00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:15,467\n[NOISE] Now, this particular\nmouse is a USB mouse and that's,\n\n438\n00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,286\nthat's really common.\n\n439\n00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:21,342\nIf you buy a computer you may get one,\nyou might get one that's Bluetooth or\n\n440\n00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:24,839\nwireless, but Even on those there'll\ntypically be a receiver for\n\n441\n00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,160\nthe computer that is USB.\n\n442\n00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,100\nSo we've got it here.\n\n443\n00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,300\nThis is a pretty run of the mill mouse.\n\n444\n00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,160\nIt's an optical mouse, but\nthat's what most of them are these days.\n\n445\n00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,500\nAnd it's just USB.\n\n446\n00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,065\nIt's a pretty rare mouse these\nThese days that isn't USB.\n\n447\n00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:40,755\nThe alternative would be\nthe old PS2 connectors.\n\n448\n00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:44,425\nNow, this particular computer\nhas USB ports and PS2.\n\n449\n00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:48,405\nIf we take a look at our available ports,\nI've got all these USB ports up here.\n\n450\n00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,690\nI've got six of them.\n\n451\n00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,730\nFor various peripherals but down here,\nthis computer still has PS2.\n\n452\n00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,220\nWith business class machines,\nthey usually ship with both still,\n\n453\n00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,110\non home class, you know like consumer\ngrade machines, usually they\n\n454\n00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,410\nleave the PS2 ports off because you\njust don't see PS2 that much anymore.\n\n455\n00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,290\nBut but you may see them.\n\n456\n00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,260\nIf you've got them it doesn't\nmean you have to use them.\n\n457\n00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,950\nYou can leave them empty.\n\n458\n00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,760\nBut you are gonna need a keyboard and\na mouse somewhere.\n\n459\n00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,365\nSo I'm gonna take this mouse and\nit's another wiry cable for me here.\n\n460\n00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:19,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I'm gonna try and\n\n461\n00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,630\nget this straightened out.\n\n462\n00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,630\nAnother trick with this is that\nyou can lay it flat on a table and\n\n463\n00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,540\nrun a hair dryer on it and\nthat'll heat the cable up a bit and\n\n464\n00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,690\nstraighten it out some\nif you're in a hurry.\n\n465\n00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,100\nOtherwise, it'll straighten out over time.\n\n466\n00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,510\nBut this one's just USB and there's\nthe USB connectors here, now personally.\n\n467\n00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,300\nI always try to plug them in the wrong\nway, so you know you try and go in and,\n\n468\n00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,840\nand they won't\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,400\n>> Won't fit.\n\n470\n00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,040\nSo, if at first it doesn't fit, you just\nmay need to turn it upside down to get it\n\n471\n00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,410\nin there, but I'll just take this one and\npick any of these ports.\n\n472\n00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,400\nEven if the USB ports\nare separate on the back,\n\n473\n00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,270\nit doesn't really matter\nwhich one you pick.\n\n474\n00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,630\nIt's universal serial buffs,\nthey don't, they don't care.\n\n475\n00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,420\nYou can plug in to anyone you choose.\n\n476\n00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,640\nI usually just have this tendency to plug\nkeyboard and mouse down in here in these\n\n477\n00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,810\nseparate ones, because I know I'm never\ngonna unhook the keyboard and mouse.\n\n478\n00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,120\nSo so I'll just plug those in right there.\n\n479\n00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,890\nSo there's my mouse, and it's plugged in.\n\n480\n00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,330\nYeah.\n\n481\n00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,330\n>> The last major peripheral that we have,\nof course,\n\n482\n00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,380\nis gonna be the main input device,\nwhich is gonna be our keyboard.\n\n483\n00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,540\nSo, with our nice Dell keyboard here.\n\n484\n00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,190\nSimply going to open up the box.\n\n485\n00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,920\nAnd we're going to see what type\nof connector that we have here.\n\n486\n00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,170\nNow normally for most of them they're\nprobably going to be USB keyboards.\n\n487\n00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,510\nLet's take a look and see if Don actually\ngrabbed one that was USB or not.\n\n488\n00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,170\nOh Don.\n\n489\n00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,710\nIt's fresh.\n\n490\n00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,372\nIt's even got it's own\nfreshness wrapper on it.\n\n491\n00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:40,680\n>> [LAUGH] Certified fresh.\n\n492\n00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,230\n>> Yes.\n\n493\n00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,229\nCertified fresh.\n\n494\n00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,730\nWrapper on it.\n\n495\n00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,535\nSo, most of them, are,\nof course, gonna go ahead and\n\n496\n00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:53,636\ncome not only in a box to protect all\nthe keys, but also in this nice little,\n\n497\n00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:57,089\nplastic wrapper so\na lot of dust doesn't get on them.\n\n498\n00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:00,937\nAnd sometimes you may even see\nthat you have a static cling I'll\n\n499\n00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,685\nwrap her over them at times.\n\n500\n00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:04,497\nAnd the thing to, to make sure that,\n\n501\n00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:08,296\nthat you are often doing of course is on\nthe bottom, you need more of an angle,\n\n502\n00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:11,960\nyou have the ability to adjust this\nto let it sit up a little bit more.\n\n503\n00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,520\nYou want it to lay a little bit\nflatter you lay those down, and\n\n504\n00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,020\njust a regular standard\nUSB type of connector.\n\n505\n00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,810\nNow Don, what is this thing?\n\n506\n00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,925\nWhat, what in the world is?\n\n507\n00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:25,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> So inside that,\n\n508\n00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,000\nthere's actually a magnet, like a,I don't\nknow if it's a rare earth magnet or\n\n509\n00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,500\nnot, but it's just a magnet, and\nit's basically a noise filter for\n\n510\n00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,390\nthe keyboard and you'll see that\non a lot of electoral devices.\n\n511\n00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,200\nActually on our video cable,\nwe had those two.\n\n512\n00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,740\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n513\n00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,980\nOn both ends of the video cable,\nyou'll see the same thing.\n\n514\n00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,290\nThat little box, and\nsometimes you can actually take them off.\n\n515\n00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,370\nThis one is built into the cable,\nso you can't.\n\n516\n00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,860\nBut that's all it really is,\nis a, a noise filter.\n\n517\n00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,270\nWhenever you're moving electricity\nover copper, you can get interference.\n\n518\n00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,730\nAnd these are designed to kind\nof filter some of that out.\n\n519\n00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,750\nThey work pretty effectively.\n\n520\n00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,970\nIt's a super simple design.\n\n521\n00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,990\nAnd so you may or may not have those.\n\n522\n00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,030\nYou don't have to have them.\n\n523\n00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,610\nSo, if you have a video cable\nthat doesn't have them on there,\n\n524\n00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,070\ndon't feel like you go out,\nyou gotta go out and buy a new one right.\n\n525\n00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,320\nIts just how they work, and if you have\na connector that's just on one end\n\n526\n00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,330\nof the cable and not the other, it doesn't\nmatter which direction you hook that up.\n\n527\n00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,790\nSo, it it's just something that you,\nyou basically ignore.\n\n528\n00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,090\nPretend like it's not there.\n\n529\n00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,770\nYup.\n\n530\n00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,370\n>> All right.\nSo, Don,\n\n531\n00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,840\nwe're just going to plug this in to one of\nthe USB ports on the back of the computer.\n\n532\n00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,960\n>> Yep.\n>> And make it work.\n\n533\n00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,650\nNow, don't forget that sometimes you also\nUSB ports on the front of the computer,\n\n534\n00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,510\nand you can hook up your mouse and your\nkeyboard, on those if you chose to, but\n\n535\n00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,990\nwhen you do something like that.\n\n536\n00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,130\nIt, it may not have to be your best bet\n\n537\n00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,100\nbecause you tend to want to be able to\nconnect things like external USB drives or\n\n538\n00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,630\nthumb drives we already got two of\nthem taken up, you can't remove one.\n\n539\n00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,700\nJust, just go well,\n\n540\n00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,780\nlet me do this temporarily cuz you're\ngonna disable your keyboard then you won't\n\n541\n00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,380\nbe able to actually copy your files over,\nor you won't be on a mouse.\n\n542\n00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,370\nSo, a lot of times, you know, using\nthe back ones for things that are going to\n\n543\n00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,500\nbe permanently plugged in are probably\nthe ones you're going to want to do, since\n\n544\n00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,360\nthey are going to be facing away from you\n>> Yeah.\n\n545\n00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520\nThat's what I do, too.\n\n546\n00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,090\nI save those front ports for\ntemporary things and\n\n547\n00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,702\nput the permanent stuff in the back.\n\n548\n00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,770\nAll right, so we got our mouse, we got\nour keyboard, we've got our monitor.\n\n549\n00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,950\nIt's all hooked up to the system.\n\n550\n00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,190\nWe could plug it in and\nturn it on right now.\n\n551\n00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,120\nHowever you might have some other\ndevices that need to be attached.\n\n552\n00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,740\nIn fact, looking at our pile here,\nI think we're down to our last device.\n\n553\n00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,630\nYour computer will likely\ncome with speakers and\n\n554\n00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,910\nthey might be speakers that sit\nright there on the desk with you.\n\n555\n00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,200\nYour computer might not come\nwith speakers at all or\n\n556\n00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,920\nmaybe you're gonna use headphones.\n\n557\n00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,760\nBut this particular computer came\nwith a pretty interesting speaker.\n\n558\n00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,770\nNow, if you look at this,\n\n559\n00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,910\nlet me just unwind this cable,\n>> Here we go.\n\n560\n00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,460\nIf you look at this,\nit's a very odd, unattractive shape.\n\n561\n00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And-\n\n562\n00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,080\n>> The reason is\n\n563\n00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,240\nthis is a speaker bar that is designed\nto attach to the bottom of the monitor.\n\n564\n00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,010\nThis weird clip up here is actually\na slide locking mount to attach\n\n565\n00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,980\nthis to the bottom of the monitor.\n\n566\n00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,380\nThese types of speakers are nice because\nthey don't take up additional space\n\n567\n00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,610\non your desk, or attach right to the\nsystem versus the desktop speakers, but\n\n568\n00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,830\nthe desktop speakers are,\nare normally creating a richer sound,\n\n569\n00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,420\nprobably have a sub-woofer and, and so on.\n\n570\n00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,520\nBut on this speaker,\nbefore I even attach it to the monitor,\n\n571\n00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,980\nI need to look at my cables,\n\n572\n00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,490\nand what you expect to see are these, let\nme just kind of show these cables here.\n\n573\n00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,740\nSo we expect to have what's basically\na 3.5 millimeter headphone jack,\n\n574\n00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,340\nthis guy right here, just your standard\naudio connector like what you would have\n\n575\n00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,910\non headphones, and it's green, and if we\nlook on the back of the computer here,\n\n576\n00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,470\nwe can find a headphone\njack that is also green.\n\n577\n00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,200\nSo that,\nthat's where this thing needs to go.\n\n578\n00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,350\nSo, I'll just plug it right in there.\n\n579\n00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,460\nMy other jack here is labeled blue and\npink and that's for a microphone.\n\n580\n00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,860\nNow, why is it blue and pink?\n\n581\n00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,380\nIf I had a microphone,\n\n582\n00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,440\nif it's an amplified microphone\nit would normally go in the pink.\n\n583\n00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,060\nAnd if it was unamplified\nit would go in the blue.\n\n584\n00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,980\n>> On this computer,\nit apparently can auto-sense and tell,\n\n585\n00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,700\nso they would just both\ngo into that same port.\n\n586\n00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,020\nSome computers will actually\nhave those separate.\n\n587\n00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,780\nNow there's another connector that comes\noff of this speaker, and that's power.\n\n588\n00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,200\nMost computer speakers require direct\n>> Power.\n\n589\n00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,610\nThey have an amplifier built into them,\nand it only works if they're plugged in.\n\n590\n00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,270\nThe speakers actually\ndo work without power.\n\n591\n00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,250\nIt's just so faint you cannot hear them.\n\n592\n00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,460\nThe amplifier changes all that, so\n\n593\n00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,700\nwe've gotta have that plugin if\nwe actually want that to work.\n\n594\n00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,510\nNow, this one, not every vendor does this,\nbut Dell did this real annoying thing,\n\n595\n00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,570\nwhere they put this short\nlittle pigtail connector, and\n\n596\n00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,280\nthen you've got the rest of the power box.\n\n597\n00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,390\nAnd the reason is they\nchanged these wall plugs.\n\n598\n00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,540\nThey changed from several\ndifferent vendors, and so\n\n599\n00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,300\nthis gave them that flexibility.\n\n600\n00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,360\nThe vendor they used for\nthis one is probably one of the worst.\n\n601\n00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,660\nThe power block for this thing is huge.\n\n602\n00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,220\nThis is like three decks of cards or\nsomething.\n\n603\n00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,370\nThis is a big power brick just for\nthis little speaker.\n\n604\n00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,730\nAnd that's frustrating but\nover time they release smaller ones and\n\n605\n00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,050\nthey're able to replace it because\nof the separate connector.\n\n606\n00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,970\nSo, I've gotta plug this into this\ncable somehow, and then it's gonna\n\n607\n00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,360\nplug into the wall, and so if I take this,\nthis is called a transformer block,\n\n608\n00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,610\nit's converting the electricity\ninto the signal the speakers want.\n\n609\n00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,770\nOn one end of it, I'm going to have\na standard two-prong power plug, well\n\n610\n00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,530\nat least in the United States, and in your\ncountry it may be something different, and\n\n611\n00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:25,140\non the other end, I hopefully have, there\nwe go, the male connector which is just,\n\n612\n00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,240\nhere if we take a look at that,\nit's just a little.\n\n613\n00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520\nLike barrel connectors,\nthere;s one big pin inside of there.\n\n614\n00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,000\nAnd if I look at my speaker,\nwhich had this,\n\n615\n00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,112\nwhich is actually a female connector,\nthose two will just pop together.\n\n616\n00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:42,378\n[NOISE] And see if I can actually do\nthis in a way that you guys can see it.\n\n617\n00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:43,760\nThose will pop together.\n\n618\n00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,450\nAnd,a little bit of force there.\n\n619\n00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,540\nNow we've got that connected.\n\n620\n00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,770\nAnd we can plug this into the wall.\n\n621\n00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,500\nSo now,\nmy speakers are ready to be powered.\n\n622\n00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,680\nWe just need to attach them\nto the bottom of the monitor.\n\n623\n00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,300\n>> Yup.\n\n624\n00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,310\n>> Ronnie.\nYou've done this one before.\n\n625\n00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,810\n>> Sure.\n>> Right.\n\n626\n00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,540\nYou want to tackle that.\n\n627\n00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,040\nI'll just hand that over to you.\n\n628\n00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,470\n>> Now, on, on our, speaker bar,\n\n629\n00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,560\nyou actually see that there\nis a clip right here.\n\n630\n00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,730\nAt the top, and it's kind of a little\nbit more unusual, because on the back\n\n631\n00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,960\nof the monitor, there's actually two\nlittle kind of slots, that what you\n\n632\n00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,890\nhave to do is, hold it to one slide and\nthen it slides and locks in place.\n\n633\n00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,280\nAnd I don't know if we can\neasily show this or not.\n\n634\n00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,100\n>> No, I wouldn't worry about it Ronnie,\nit's not a, a common standard,\n\n635\n00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,030\nthis is proprietary.\n\n636\n00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,420\nSo, Dell has chosen to do this,\nand And that's what they've done.\n\n637\n00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,080\nYou know, David was asking what\nmodel of monitor that was and\n\n638\n00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,870\nI don't actually know.\n\n639\n00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,420\nDoes it have it written on\nthe back of the monitor?\n\n640\n00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,720\nIs that.\n>> Well, let's see.\n\n641\n00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,770\n>> Is that we, we can find out.\n\n642\n00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,285\nIt's, you know, in standard Dell style\nthey put the revision number, but\n\n643\n00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:44,905\nthe model is probably microscopic.\n\n644\n00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:45,865\n>> Yeah, I don't see it.\n\n645\n00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:47,685\nWe can try and find out.\n\n646\n00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:50,275\n>> Yeah, we can find it [INAUDIBLE]\nActually, we've kind of run out\n\n647\n00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,935\nof time in this segment anyway so\nthere's a good spot to take a break.\n\n648\n00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:57,525\nLet's do this, we'll go ahead and\nstop here and take a break.\n\n649\n00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,880\nWhen we get back, we've got everything\nhooked up But we haven't plugged it in yet\n\n650\n00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,380\nand what we need to do is just a few\nmore things before we're done.\n\n651\n00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,270\nSo, we do need to try and\npower it on and make sure it's working.\n\n652\n00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,760\nAnd then we need to do a little\nbit of cable management.\n\n653\n00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,410\nSo, let's stop here and take a break.\n\n654\n00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,790\nAnd when we get back, we're going to\nfinish setting up the hardware, and\n\n655\n00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,790\nthen we'll move onto software.\n\n656\n00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,800\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n657\n00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,390\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n658\n00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:26,055\n[MUSIC]\n\n659\n00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:26,555\nAll right.\n\n660\n00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,140\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n661\n00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,450\nSo, we've got our computer\nall hooked up now.\n\n662\n00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,360\nI went ahead and\nplugged in the power during the break.\n\n663\n00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,610\nRight.\nWe'd already connected this to\n\n664\n00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,790\nthe computer, so just down here we've\ngot a power strip under our podium.\n\n665\n00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,230\nAnd I, I just plugged the other\nend of those power cables in.\n\n666\n00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,110\nNow, when I plugged it in,\nI plugged in the monitor.\n\n667\n00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,330\nThe sound bar and\nthe desktop tower, all right?\n\n668\n00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,580\nSo they've all got power.\n\n669\n00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,786\nAnd when I plug in the desktop tower,\njust for a moment, the fans kicked on and\n\n670\n00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:52,778\nthen kicked off.\n\n671\n00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,123\nA lot of computers will do that.\n\n672\n00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:58,580\nAs soon as they receive power, they just\ndo a quick little test and that's that.\n\n673\n00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,600\nThe monitor, on the other hand, you can\nactually see it right here pretty well.\n\n674\n00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,535\nIts got a little message.\n\n675\n00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,700\nIt's kinda bouncing around the screen and\n\n676\n00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,250\nit's displaying some colors,\nred, green, whatever.\n\n677\n00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,220\nAnd it's got a warning message on\nthere saying No Signal Detected.\n\n678\n00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,930\nNow, I kind of expect that,\nbecause the computer's not on, right?\n\n679\n00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,180\nI haven't turned it on so\nit's not gonna get a signal.\n\n680\n00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,660\nYou may see a warning sign like this,\nyou may not.\n\n681\n00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,620\nA lot of monitors will have a little\npower light at the bottom right, or\n\n682\n00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,800\nthe bottom left or middle or wherever.\n\n683\n00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,480\nAnd it might be green when it has\na signal and orange when it doesn't or\n\n684\n00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,090\norange if it's gone to sleep.\n\n685\n00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,569\nMonitors will go to sleep\nif you're not using them.\n\n686\n00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,520\n>> This one here, the power light's\nactually a little darker blue color, but\n\n687\n00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,360\nthey can be any color itself.\n\n688\n00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,630\nAnd that little bar that's\ngoing across the screen is\n\n689\n00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,070\nreally a kinda nice little diagnostic for\nus.\n\n690\n00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,867\nNot only is it warning us that\nwe're not getting a signal,\n\n691\n00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:51,070\nit is telling us that it's\nexpecting to receive a signal.\n\n692\n00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,590\nAnd because we can see those\ndifferent colors there,\n\n693\n00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,690\nit tells us the monitor's\nactually working fine.\n\n694\n00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,766\nAnd we saw that red bar and\nit actually looked pink,\n\n695\n00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,766\nthen we might know that\nsomething else is wrong.\n\n696\n00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:04,030\n>> Yeah, and especially with DVI cables,\nyou can actually get them a little bit\n\n697\n00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,150\ncrooked and some of the colors will fade\nout, and it results in some weird stuff.\n\n698\n00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,650\nAnd you just tighten the cable and\nit's all fixed up.\n\n699\n00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,960\nAll right, well, Ronnie, let's apply some\npower to this thing and see what happens.\n\n700\n00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,480\n>> All right.\n\n701\n00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,530\n>> Ideally, we turn it on,\nwe get a picture on the screen,\n\n702\n00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,350\na little light flashes on our keyboard,\nand we're ready to rock.\n\n703\n00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,640\nSo he's gonna hit that power button and\nthis fan's gonna be right by my microphone\n\n704\n00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,950\nso we get to listen to the joy\nof the fan for a moment.\n\n705\n00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,698\nI see the monitor just flickered and\nthere's a Dell message.\n\n706\n00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:32,549\n>> There it is.\n\n707\n00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,870\n>> BIOS message and\nnow it's starting to boot up.\n\n708\n00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,300\nSo it looks like we're\nin pretty decent shape.\n\n709\n00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,250\nIt's doing its little\npower on self-test and\n\n710\n00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,730\nit's gonna start loading\nthe operating system.\n\n711\n00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,424\nSo, there it's going, and this one,\n\n712\n00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:47,950\nsometimes when you boot them up, it'll\nprompt you if you wanna boot normally or\n\n713\n00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,140\ndo a factory reset,\nit'll give you like a factory menu.\n\n714\n00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,240\nAnd this one, we can just probably\npress that button and off it'll go.\n\n715\n00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240\nThere it goes booting Windows.\n\n716\n00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,968\nNow, I don't actually wanna boot it all\nthe way here, so I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n717\n00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:03,972\nBut once it comes up, we can start\nour initial setup of the system,\n\n718\n00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:06,269\nwhich we'll see here in a little bit.\n\n719\n00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:10,071\nNow, it looks like everything powered\non for me and things were good.\n\n720\n00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:14,000\nBut here's some common\nproblems you might bump into.\n\n721\n00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,230\nYou turn your computer on and\nno video, all right?\n\n722\n00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,370\nOne of the main causes of that is\nthat the monitor might be set to\n\n723\n00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,020\none of the video inputs other\nthan what you connected.\n\n724\n00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,190\nRemember, this monitor had DVI and VGA.\n\n725\n00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,030\nWell, this monitor does auto-sensing so\nit'll flip to whichever one has a signal.\n\n726\n00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,590\nBut not every monitor does.\n\n727\n00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,740\nSo if you don't get video, look for\nan input changing button on the monitor.\n\n728\n00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,290\nThere's usually one somewhere\naround the bezel of the monitor and\n\n729\n00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,760\nit'll typically have a square with an\narrow coming out of it or going into it.\n\n730\n00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,670\nAnd you can push that button and\nit'll rotate through the inputs.\n\n731\n00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,157\nSo, you might have hooked up a VGA cable\nand it's looking at an HDMI input, or\n\n732\n00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:54,928\nvice versa.\n\n733\n00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,999\nAnd you just switch, and\nthere's your video, all right?\n\n734\n00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:00,378\nYou could have a loose video cable.\n\n735\n00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:04,090\nYou always check your cables and\nmake sure that they're connected well.\n\n736\n00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,590\nIf your power is being\nrun to a power strip,\n\n737\n00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,320\nthe power strip could actually be off.\n\n738\n00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,660\nThese are all little things that we need\nto check to ensure that it's all hooked\n\n739\n00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,770\nup right and securely.\n\n740\n00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,910\nNow, worst case scenario, if your computer\nwas shipped to you, so if it was delivered\n\n741\n00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,750\nUPS or somebody like that, the shipping\ncompanies are pretty rough with computers.\n\n742\n00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,490\nAnd it is possible that a component\ninside of the computer has become loose.\n\n743\n00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,950\nIf it was the video card or\nthe memory that became loose,\n\n744\n00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,130\nthe system won't power up correctly and\nyou won't get video.\n\n745\n00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,860\nBut that's pretty uncommon.\n\n746\n00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,000\nI know we saw on some of our other\nepisodes memory now has these locking\n\n747\n00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,990\narms on them and even the video\nadapters have locking connectors, too.\n\n748\n00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,230\nSo they don't really work loose anymore.\n\n749\n00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,739\nBut if you have an older computer it is\npossible, I've seen it more then once.\n\n750\n00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,520\nOther things to watch out for.\n\n751\n00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,790\nIf you hit that power button and you get\na message saying no input device detected,\n\n752\n00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,940\nor keyboard failure, press F1 to continue.\n\n753\n00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,430\nThat means that it booted up and\nit didn't find a keyboard.\n\n754\n00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,960\nIt doesn't care about the mouse.\n\n755\n00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,670\nBut the computers will generally\nrequire a keyboard to boot up.\n\n756\n00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,730\nIf it's USB, it's not normally a big deal.\n\n757\n00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,630\nBut if it's PS2, a great indicator there\nmight be that you plugged the keyboard\n\n758\n00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,220\ninto the mouse port instead\nof the keyboard port.\n\n759\n00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,480\nSo you may need to move it to\nthe other correct connector.\n\n760\n00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,690\nDo remember that PS2 doesn't\nsupport doing that live.\n\n761\n00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,600\nSo if it is in the wrong port, you need to\ngo ahead and move it to the other port.\n\n762\n00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,920\nBut you'll have to turn\nthe computer off and\n\n763\n00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,130\nback on again before it recognizes\nit in the different port.\n\n764\n00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,130\nSo that's another situation that you\nmight have when you boot the system up.\n\n765\n00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,430\nAll right.\n\n766\n00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,510\nAll those are pretty easy to correct,\nthough.\n\n767\n00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,850\nFor most of these devices, their DOA rate,\n\n768\n00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,180\nthe dead on arrival rate,\n[LAUGH] is pretty low.\n\n769\n00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,530\nMost of the equipment is\ntested at the factory.\n\n770\n00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,540\nAnd they're packed pretty\nwell in their boxes, so\n\n771\n00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,867\nyou don't normally get damaged equipment,\nbut it can happen.\n\n772\n00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:03,590\nAll right, once we're hooked up, if we're\nstill having some kind of problem and\n\n773\n00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,410\nit won't come on, you can always\nrefer to the manual for the device.\n\n774\n00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,880\nIn the box of all the stuff you got, they\nusually include a quick start guide and\n\n775\n00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,280\na configuration manual for\nthe equipment, so\n\n776\n00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280\nyou can always refer\nto that documentation.\n\n777\n00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,580\nIf you can't find the answer there,\nit's time to call tech support.\n\n778\n00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,700\nIf you bought it from HP or\nDell or whoever, call them up.\n\n779\n00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,410\nThey've got a support number and they'll\nwalk you through some troubleshooting\n\n780\n00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,668\nprocesses to try and get if fixed.\n\n781\n00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,500\nAnd if your unit is DOA,\n\n782\n00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,800\nif it's just not working,\nthey'll send a replacement, right?\n\n783\n00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,310\nSo they can get that taken care of,\n\n784\n00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,360\nand you don't have to spend\na ton of time dealing with it.\n\n785\n00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,390\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nwe need to be aware of when we go and\n\n786\n00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,250\nget that hooked up.\n\n787\n00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,460\nNow, in this scenario,\nwe're all hooked up, we're done,\n\n788\n00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,230\nlet's get to using the computer, right?\n\n789\n00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,580\nWell, there's one more thing\nthat we'll normally do.\n\n790\n00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,650\nNow that I know it'll power on and\n\n791\n00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,090\neverything's happy, we probably need\nto tidy up our cables a little bit.\n\n792\n00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,280\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n793\n00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,370\nI don't know if you guys can see all this\nnow, but if we take all the different\n\n794\n00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,640\ncables that are coming out of the back of\nthis thing, there are a bunch of them.\n\n795\n00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,760\nAnd it's a bit of a mess.\n\n796\n00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,818\nAnd my main problem is that I\nhave things like the keyboard,\n\n797\n00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:16,015\nwhich is one foot away from right here.\n\n798\n00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:17,945\nBut the cable on it is probably six foot.\n\n799\n00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,725\nSo I gotta ton an extra,\nthat's what all this is.\n\n800\n00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:24,055\nThis is all extra keyboard cable\nhere that I don't really need and\n\n801\n00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,930\nthere's extra mouse cable\nthat I don't need, right?\n\n802\n00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,550\nWhat do we do with all this extra cable?\n\n803\n00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,170\nWell, you can do what's\ncalled cable management.\n\n804\n00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,300\nAnd that's where we wrap up and\nwe bundle our cables to make them a little\n\n805\n00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,550\nmore neat, to make it look more\npleasing on the table and so on.\n\n806\n00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,870\nThere's not any practical\nreason to do cable management.\n\n807\n00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,920\nIt can I guess kind of help\nwith troubleshooting sometimes.\n\n808\n00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520\nIt's easier to see.\n\n809\n00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,330\nOr maybe if you have enough cables\nthey might be blocking airflow out of\n\n810\n00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,510\nthe computer, but typically we do\ncable management for aesthetics,\n\n811\n00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,507\njust to make it look prettier, right?\n\n812\n00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,480\nAnd you'll find that different\ndevices have different\n\n813\n00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,920\nfeatures in them to\nprovide cable management.\n\n814\n00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,877\nLike this monitor,\n\n815\n00:39:03,877 --> 00:39:07,097\nif I turn it around, let's get back\nto where we can see the monitor.\n\n816\n00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:11,893\nIf we turn it around and look at\nthe back side, we just lift it up or,\n\n817\n00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:13,702\nlet's go, there we go.\n\n818\n00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,287\nActually, here, we can put it down now.\n\n819\n00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:19,408\nSo if you look at this monitor, there's\nthis big square right here, all right?\n\n820\n00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,110\nWhat's that square all about?\n\n821\n00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,715\nWell, we've got a video cable and\nwe've got a power cable and\n\n822\n00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:27,696\nwe've got a speaker wire,\nand we've got power for\n\n823\n00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:31,880\nthe speaker, all these cables\ncoming out of the computer.\n\n824\n00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,430\nWhat we could do is we could\nrun them through this hole.\n\n825\n00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,522\nSo now they come out of the monitor and\nrun right into that hole bundled together.\n\n826\n00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:45,377\nAnd we can take those and we can use our\nlittle twisty ties that we save from\n\n827\n00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:50,789\neverything that we took apart earlier and\nwe can wrap these around it every foot or\n\n828\n00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,754\nwhatever, every 15 centimeters there.\n\n829\n00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:55,150\n[LAUGH] or\nwhatever it is that we're doing.\n\n830\n00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,310\nTo bundle up and keep it nice and neat.\n\n831\n00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,791\nSo now you've got one bundle of cable\nthat comes out of the computer and\n\n832\n00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,250\nruns behind your desk.\n\n833\n00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,660\nSo when somebody walks up to your desk and\n\n834\n00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,710\nlooks at it,\nthey don't see this big mess of cables.\n\n835\n00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,400\nYou can also take the cables for your\nkeyboard and the cable for your mouse and\n\n836\n00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,320\nrun them through the same hole, so\nwhen you're looking at the monitor,\n\n837\n00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,370\nit almost looks like the keyboard and\nmouse are connected to the monitor.\n\n838\n00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,710\nInstead of just running down\nthe backside of the desk.\n\n839\n00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,430\nAnd then you bundle all those are up.\n\n840\n00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,620\nYou wrap them up with these twist ties.\n\n841\n00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,417\nOr one of the things I like\nto use instead is Velcro.\n\n842\n00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,810\nRight?\n\n843\n00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,330\nSpace age technology here.\n\n844\n00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,810\nVelcro, you can buy it\nat any hardware store.\n\n845\n00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,550\nYou can buy it at computer stores but\nit's always more expensive.\n\n846\n00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,770\nI just go to the hardware store.\n\n847\n00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,070\nAnd you can buy as much\nVelcro as you want.\n\n848\n00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,590\nWith Velcro it's nice because when\nyou wrap up a cable, you can quickly\n\n849\n00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,900\nunwrap it if you need to add a new cable,\nyou add a new device later on.\n\n850\n00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,650\nSo you can take all of your cables and\n\n851\n00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,860\nstart to,\nlike all this extra cablework, cable.\n\n852\n00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,025\nI can bundle that up, and\njust throw a little Velcro over it.\n\n853\n00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:57,790\nRight?\n\n854\n00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,090\nAnd one day if I'm ever in\na situation where I need to get my\n\n855\n00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,410\nkeyboard a little further\naway from the computer.\n\n856\n00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,250\nI can just quickly undo that Velcro, but\n\n857\n00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,640\nnow it's gonna be taking up a lot\nless space, look a lot neater.\n\n858\n00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,130\nAnd I can combine other cables with it,\nso, you know, here,\n\n859\n00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,170\nI've got my extra mouse cable,\nI might choose to bundle that up, and\n\n860\n00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,812\nwrap it up as a part of that,\ntoo, and bundle it.\n\n861\n00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:23,210\nBut, you use your judgment,\njust use basic cable management.\n\n862\n00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,540\nTidy it all up so it looks nice.\n\n863\n00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,780\nSome of these new monitors look gorgeous.\n\n864\n00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,160\nThey have these stylized bottoms,\nyou know, the stands to them and\n\n865\n00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,770\nthey just look really nice.\n\n866\n00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,380\nAnd you get these fancy keyboards.\n\n867\n00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,920\nYou don't wanna have a giant\nmess of cable sitting behind it.\n\n868\n00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,816\nHere we tie it up and nice and clean.\n\n869\n00:41:37,816 --> 00:41:39,960\nAnd out of the way.\n\n870\n00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,480\nAnd since the cables are bound together\nIf you ever tug on one by accident,\n\n871\n00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,410\nusually the pressure is\ndissipated into the Velcro.\n\n872\n00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,710\nAnd you won't accidentally\nunplug the device.\n\n873\n00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,630\nSo, it kinda creates a little\nmore security there too.\n\n874\n00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,060\nBut it is a good idea on the back side\nof your computer you may need to do\n\n875\n00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,700\nthat also.\n\n876\n00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,090\nMines fairly clean here, but\nI might wanna take all of these and\n\n877\n00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,009\nbundle them together too.\n\n878\n00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:05,790\nRight?\nSo that speaker, keyboard, mouse,\n\n879\n00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,070\npower, video, they're bumped up\nbecause I've got these fans, right?\n\n880\n00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,590\nI've got air coming out\nof the power supply here.\n\n881\n00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,080\nI've got air coming out of the case here.\n\n882\n00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,395\nIf there's a bunch of cables in\nfront of that, it can block airflow.\n\n883\n00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:23,305\nBut if I take all this and bundle it up,\nI can make sure that it is out of the way.\n\n884\n00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:28,865\nOr even if it's still in the way, by\nbundling them together, it will keep them.\n\n885\n00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:34,567\nKind of bundled and where they\ncreate less of an obstruction and\n\n886\n00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,197\nobviously you'd going to do more\nof this Velcro down the line.\n\n887\n00:42:37,197 --> 00:42:41,747\nNow there are other things that we can\nuse if you wanna go hard core like.\n\n888\n00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:42,957\nNate here on our show.\n\n889\n00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,170\nHe does a couple of things.\n\n890\n00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,540\nI know he's bought shrink-wrap before and\nput it around the cables and done that.\n\n891\n00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,220\nBut there's also the cable\nsocks that you can get,\n\n892\n00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,690\nwhich, do we have any of that up here?\n\n893\n00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,780\n>> We do, but it's on the floor.\n\n894\n00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,670\n>> Oh, yeah, here,\noh no that's actually attached to a cable.\n\n895\n00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,800\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, it's a little expanding wrap\n\n896\n00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,080\nthat kinda goes around a cable,\nor a set of cables and\n\n897\n00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,510\nmakes it look like one big cable and\nit's kinda nice.\n\n898\n00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:11,430\nIt's like the, you maybe as a kid you\nplayed with the Chinese finger traps,\n\n899\n00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,870\nthe little mesh.\n\n900\n00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,510\nAnd, with, it's just like that for\ncable except one side is cut so\n\n901\n00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,100\nyou can easily slide the cable into it.\n\n902\n00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,410\nSo, there's all sorts of neat cable\nmanagement stuff that's out there.\n\n903\n00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,590\nBut at a minimum, just save your twist\nties, you probably have a good eight or\n\n904\n00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,885\nnine of these things from\nunwrapping all your cables,\n\n905\n00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:31,710\nre-use them, it's a, good use for them.\n\n906\n00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,970\nAll right, so Ronnie at this point\nour physical computer is hooked up.\n\n907\n00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,510\n>> It is.\n>> We got it in place.\n\n908\n00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,650\nAnd now I think we're ready to move\non to our initial computer set up.\n\n909\n00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,520\nThe software set up.\n\n910\n00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,260\n>> That's right.\n\n911\n00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,320\nYeah.\n>> All right.\n\n912\n00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,130\nWell why don't we stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n913\n00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,110\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna rearrange our podium so\n\n914\n00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,360\nwe can get back to our laptops again.\n\n915\n00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,390\nAnd when we come back from the break\nwe'll do our initial software set up.\n\n916\n00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,450\nSo stay tuned.\n\n917\n00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,519\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n918\n00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:02,483\n[MUSIC]\n\n919\n00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:03,210\nAll right.\n\n920\n00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,390\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n921\n00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,490\nSo we've done some rearranging\nsome spring cleaning up here and\n\n922\n00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,620\ngot that computer out of the way.\n\n923\n00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,570\nOur computer's all set up.\n\n924\n00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,070\nWe're powering it on, and now we need\nto go through some of the next steps of\n\n925\n00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,250\ngetting a workstation ready for\njust regular use.\n\n926\n00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,320\nAll right.\n\n927\n00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,490\nNow when you first power on a workstation.\n\n928\n00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,080\nThey usually haven't done the full\nconfiguration back at the factory.\n\n929\n00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,660\nThere's some steps that you need to go\nthrough to make the machine unique,\n\n930\n00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,550\nto make it your own, right?\n\n931\n00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,260\nAnd what they call this\nis the out-of-box setup.\n\n932\n00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,090\nYou've just got the computer\nout of the box and\n\n933\n00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,910\nnow it goes through a little setup wizard.\n\n934\n00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,870\nAnd it's normally really basic stuff and\nso that's what we're gonna see here.\n\n935\n00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,430\nNow we're gonna use Windows 7\nbecause that's what's on the exam.\n\n936\n00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:48,230\nBut if it's Windows 8 or Mac OS or Linux,\nmost of them do the exact same thing.\n\n937\n00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,250\nThey ask you some basic questions.\n\n938\n00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,060\nAbout where you are,\n\n939\n00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,410\ncuz if they don't know where in the world\nyou gonna be setting this stuff up.\n\n940\n00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,740\nSo, lets take a look at that.\n\n941\n00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,570\nI'm gonna power this\nWindows 7 machine on and\n\n942\n00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,830\nlet me get just a second while that\nscreen refreshes and there we go.\n\n943\n00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,320\nAll right, so lets take a look at this and\nhere we go with Windows 7 booting up and\n\n944\n00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,560\nsee how it says setup is preparing for\nthe first time and\n\n945\n00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,650\nnow its checking video and so on.\n\n946\n00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,990\nSo what's it doing here?\n\n947\n00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,580\nWell, back at the factory\nthey may manufacture several\n\n948\n00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,240\ndifferent types of computers.\n\n949\n00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,680\nSo some computers might\nhave high end video cards.\n\n950\n00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,050\nSome might have low-end video cards,\nthere might be different processors.\n\n951\n00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,140\nWindows 7 is designed so\nthat the first time it boots up\n\n952\n00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,160\nit'll detect a lot of that hardware and\ncustomize itself to match that.\n\n953\n00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,300\nIf you have a single-core processor\nversus a multi-core processor it has to\n\n954\n00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,570\ntreat it differently.\n\n955\n00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,790\nSo it's recognizing that and\n\n956\n00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,750\nin the end, you'll be dropped off\nat a menu something like this.\n\n957\n00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n958\n00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,510\nThis is the first time where you'll\nactually have to put in some information.\n\n959\n00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,980\nAnd what we're doing is we're\ncustomizing it for our use.\n\n960\n00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,630\nSo usually we're gonna see that\nwe're gonna see the country and\n\n961\n00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,060\nthe region and then there's some other\ninformation as we follow through.\n\n962\n00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:56,800\nSo right here,\n\n963\n00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,260\nit drops us off the nice thing is it tells\nus what version of Windows that we're in.\n\n964\n00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,160\nAnd then allows us to pick that\ncountry and that region that we're in.\n\n965\n00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,730\nAnd even currency and our time.\n\n966\n00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,380\nYeah.\n>> Yeah,\n\n967\n00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,320\nyou know, depending on where you live,\n\n968\n00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,670\nthings might be a little bit different,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n969\n00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,010\n>> So they're asking about that\n>> When it says country or\n\n970\n00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,050\nregion, you'll have some choices.\n\n971\n00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,980\nAnd when you buy Windows, if you're buying\nit at a local retailer, you'll probably\n\n972\n00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,812\nget what's called a localized copy of\nWindows that will just have your country.\n\n973\n00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:24,970\nAll right?\n\n974\n00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,450\nHere in the U.S. it's pretty common for\n\n975\n00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,310\nus to buy them and only have\na choice between U.S. and Canada.\n\n976\n00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,880\nAll right, that's really pretty common.\n\n977\n00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,070\nBut in my case I've got Enterprise and\n\n978\n00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,360\nthe Enterprise addition has\nall of the countries in it.\n\n979\n00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,930\nAnd so I get the full list and you can\nsee all the different ones that I picked.\n\n980\n00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,622\nNow, why does it care what country I'm in?\n\n981\n00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:45,070\nIt's gonna use that to influence\nwhat language Windows is running in.\n\n982\n00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,880\nIt's also gonna use it to\ninfluence how my keyboard works.\n\n983\n00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,020\nDifferent keyboards have different\nkeys based on a language.\n\n984\n00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,590\nAnd so\nthis is how it's gonna find that out.\n\n985\n00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:59,350\nSo if I say I'm in the United States and\nI'm using English as my default language.\n\n986\n00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,200\nTime and currency will be\nrepresented the way we do.\n\n987\n00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,650\nSo, here in the U.S. we represent\ntime as usually of 12 hours time,\n\n988\n00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,122\nso I might say that it is 4 a.m.\n\n989\n00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,280\nOr 4 p.m.\n\n990\n00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,150\nversus in other countries, like in France,\nthey typically use the 24 hour clock.\n\n991\n00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,040\nSo you have 4 o'clock which would\nsimply be four in the morning.\n\n992\n00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,290\nAnd you've got 1600, or\n16 o'clock, which would be 4 p.m.\n\n993\n00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,340\nIn the afternoon.\n\n994\n00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,550\nSo, different regions have it differently.\n\n995\n00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,040\nSame thing goes for currency.\n\n996\n00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,610\nHere in the U.S.\nwe've got the American dollar, but.\n\n997\n00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,090\nOver in France they have the Euro.\n\n998\n00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:39,085\nSo it would be a different currency,\nand decimal points are different.\n\n999\n00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if I write 1000, I write 1,000 but\n\n1000\n00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,295\nin France they would write 1.000.\n\n1001\n00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,767\nThey use a decimal marker for\nthe thousand digits.\n\n1002\n00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:50,740\nSo those were just little\ndifferences that we have.\n\n1003\n00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,039\nAnd you can pick from your\nvarious keyboard layouts.\n\n1004\n00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,639\nAnd we're, U.S.\nso that's the one that we want.\n\n1005\n00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,010\nAll right, those are called\nyour localization settings.\n\n1006\n00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,650\n>> The next screen that we have,\nof course, allows us to go ahead and\n\n1007\n00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,290\ncreate the first account on the computer\nthat we'll then set up from there,\n\n1008\n00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,810\nwhich will make your account\nthe Administrator account, too.\n\n1009\n00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,520\nSo Don's going ahead, and\nhe's typing in his username.\n\n1010\n00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,160\nAnd notice how the actual PC name,\nthey went and keyed it in to his name,\n\n1011\n00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,530\nbecause they don't wanna leave\nit as some unusual default,\n\n1012\n00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,350\nwhich is gonna be generated by a computer.\n\n1013\n00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:29,020\nSometimes we see it where it's like\na 12-character with letters and numbers.\n\n1014\n00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,950\nBut here it automatically\nfills it in with Don's name if\n\n1015\n00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,340\nhe's not gonna actually\npick anything else.\n\n1016\n00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,870\n>> And I'll change it to something else,\nI'm gonna call this DPDESKTOP, right.\n\n1017\n00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,130\nBecause I've got a laptop another thing,\n\n1018\n00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,010\nso Don Pezet PC is not\nreally detailed enough.\n\n1019\n00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,265\nSo I'm just gonna call it DPDESKTOP.\n\n1020\n00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:46,450\nAnd I'm making it all capital\nletters just because I feel like it.\n\n1021\n00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,500\nYou can put whatever you want in here.\n\n1022\n00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,260\nThey don't like spaces, so\nyou don't want to put a space in the name.\n\n1023\n00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,830\nIt'll warn you if you type a space.\n\n1024\n00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,460\nThere, I get a big error about it.\n\n1025\n00:48:54,460 --> 00:49:00,220\nThe other thing is if I type\nsomething really long, it stops me.\n\n1026\n00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,680\nIt's stops me at 15 characters,\nand that's actually a throwback\n\n1027\n00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,990\nto some backwards compatibility for\nWindows with older systems.\n\n1028\n00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,780\nThere was this protocol call NetBIOS\nthat we still use a little bit today.\n\n1029\n00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,918\nSo it stops me at 15 characters.\n\n1030\n00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:15,519\nAll right, but\nI'll just go DPDESKTOP and hit Next.\n\n1031\n00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,820\nAnd username is already in use.\n\n1032\n00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,850\nSomehow I have preceded this with my name.\n\n1033\n00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,990\nSorry, so we'll just go John Doe.\n\n1034\n00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:29,440\nAnd we'll just say this is JDDESKTOP,\nall right.\n\n1035\n00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,400\nOn the next screen, it's gonna ask for\nmy password, and so I can punch that in.\n\n1036\n00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,427\nBut they make you type it twice\njust in case you mess it up.\n\n1037\n00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:36,053\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But notice how it says,\n\n1038\n00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,350\nType a password (recommended).\n\n1039\n00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,840\nI might not want a password for\nthis account.\n\n1040\n00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,020\nSo I could choose to leave it off.\n\n1041\n00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,890\nIf this is a home computer,\nmaybe I'm not concerned about that.\n\n1042\n00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,680\nBut I think it's a good practice\nto always have a password,\n\n1043\n00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,260\nregardless of where your computer is.\n\n1044\n00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,850\nSo I'll punch one in.\n\n1045\n00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,460\nNow, this is one of my least\nfavorite things about Windows.\n\n1046\n00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,720\nIt requires a password hint.\n\n1047\n00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,725\nThe problem here is if somebody's\ntrying to guess the password,\n\n1048\n00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:57,898\nit's gonna give them the hint, too.\n\n1049\n00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:00,082\nThere's no way to disseminate that,\nso I hate hints.\n\n1050\n00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:03,120\nAnd so\nthat's exactly what I normally write.\n\n1051\n00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,930\nI normally write, I hate hints.\n\n1052\n00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,880\nBut you can put whatever\nyou want in there.\n\n1053\n00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,610\nIt's supposed to be a hint to help\nyou remember what your password was.\n\n1054\n00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,353\nNow, the end user license agreement,\nthis is your favorite part, right?\n\n1055\n00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:15,177\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1056\n00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:18,358\nThis is the part that normally\nI just check and then go on.\n\n1057\n00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,130\nOf course, everybody should\nread every single word of this.\n\n1058\n00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,180\nMore than likely,\nwe're gonna accept the terms.\n\n1059\n00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,010\nThis is the saying what you're not going\nto do with the operating system and\n\n1060\n00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,580\nwhat you can do with the operating system.\n\n1061\n00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,191\n>> And there's all sorts of indemnity and-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1062\n00:50:32,191 --> 00:50:33,088\n>> Liability and all sorts of\n\n1063\n00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:33,828\ncrazy stuff in here.\n\n1064\n00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:37,575\nAnd it is funny because these end user\nlicense agreements have repeatedly not\n\n1065\n00:50:37,575 --> 00:50:41,104\nbeen upheld in courts, but they still\nput them as part of due diligence.\n\n1066\n00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,042\nSo, there's a lot of good stuff there.\n\n1067\n00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:44,274\nWe'll just move next.\n\n1068\n00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,754\nNow Windows 7 tries to set us up\nwith some basic security in place,\n\n1069\n00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:51,435\nwhich is pretty useful, and\nwe don't normally wanna mess with that.\n\n1070\n00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:55,820\nBut, we do have the chance to override\nit if we don't like that behavior.\n\n1071\n00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,825\nThe default is it's going to try and\nupdate the operating system automatically,\n\n1072\n00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:02,325\nreaching out and downloading updates.\n\n1073\n00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,035\nBut you can tell it to only\ndo critical updates or\n\n1074\n00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:08,285\nnot to do updates at all and\ninstead of have you manually do them.\n\n1075\n00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:10,135\nIt's your choice how you want to go.\n\n1076\n00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,895\nBut the recommended settings\nare going to be automatic,\n\n1077\n00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,695\nand that's really what\nmost people should choose.\n\n1078\n00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,700\nThen, I can pick my time.\n\n1079\n00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,920\nIt probably will have the correct\ntime already because it's tied to\n\n1080\n00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,630\nyour BIOS clock on the motherboard, but\nit won't know what time zone you're in.\n\n1081\n00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:26,262\nSo you'll need to pick.\n\n1082\n00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:30,190\nIt will at least get you in the right\ncountry from the country screen earlier,\n\n1083\n00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,741\nbut now you need to pick\nthe time zone inside of it.\n\n1084\n00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:35,562\nAnd so we're U.S. Eastern here,\nand so I can choose that.\n\n1085\n00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:38,234\nBut you just choose what was\nappropriate and whether or\n\n1086\n00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,730\nnot you observe daylight savings time.\n\n1087\n00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,740\nHere in the US not every state and not\nevery city observes daylight savings time.\n\n1088\n00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,140\nAnd so you might need to turn that off,\nall right?\n\n1089\n00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,860\nBut it says it's 3:33, and looking at\nthe clock over here that's about right.\n\n1090\n00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,790\nSo I will hit Next.\n\n1091\n00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,400\nAnd now it's asking what kind\nof network I'm plugged into.\n\n1092\n00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n1093\n00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,220\nThe network location really\nis changing the profile and\n\n1094\n00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,140\nthe way that we connect to the network.\n\n1095\n00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,290\nWhat it's doing, it's helping us to\nset up the firewall settings and\n\n1096\n00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,670\ngiving us some preconfigured settings.\n\n1097\n00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,220\nSo, the home network is gonna\nbe a little bit less restrictive\n\n1098\n00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,490\nthan the public network.\n\n1099\n00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:15,000\nAnd work network are even less\nrestrictive than even the home network.\n\n1100\n00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,900\n>> Yeah, the key thing to\nremember here is that home and\n\n1101\n00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,270\nwork allow network discovery.\n\n1102\n00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,400\nSo you can browse and find file shares and\nprinters and so on, and\n\n1103\n00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,970\nother people can find you.\n\n1104\n00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,450\nBut public turns all the discovery off.\n\n1105\n00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:31,820\nIf you're in Starbucks having a cup of\ncoffee on their wireless, you don't want\n\n1106\n00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,900\npeople to discover your laptop, and you're\nnot going to try and discover theirs.\n\n1107\n00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,510\nSo, the public side is\nthe most restrictive.\n\n1108\n00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,420\nThe other two are pretty\nclose to the same.\n\n1109\n00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,650\nYou're exactly right though, Ryan,\nthe work one is a little more open.\n\n1110\n00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,870\nYou can change this later.\n\n1111\n00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,490\nSo if you pick the wrong one,\nyou can deal with it.\n\n1112\n00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,460\nAnd every time you add\na new network connection,\n\n1113\n00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,410\nit'll prompt you again to pick what it is.\n\n1114\n00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,690\nSo I'll go ahead and say that this is a,\n\n1115\n00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,430\nI'll go work network, right,\nwe're at the office, all right.\n\n1116\n00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:58,436\nSo there it's got my basic information.\n\n1117\n00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,120\nNow, it's gonna log me in for\nthe first time.\n\n1118\n00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,305\nAnd this might take a moment.\n\n1119\n00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,505\nIt's creating your user profile.\n\n1120\n00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:07,015\nAnd your user profile is made up of\na lot of different files, and so\n\n1121\n00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,575\nit's building that in the background.\n\n1122\n00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:11,095\nSo don't be alarmed if your\ncomputer sits here for\n\n1123\n00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:14,040\na moment at the welcome\nscreen just waiting.\n\n1124\n00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,680\nIn Windows 8 it actually has\na couple of different messages that\n\n1125\n00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,600\npop up to make you feel\ngood about yourself.\n\n1126\n00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,620\nBut in Windows 7-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1127\n00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,733\n>> It just says stuff like this,\n\n1128\n00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,722\nPreparing your desktop.\n\n1129\n00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:23,319\nIt'll say loading profile and\n\n1130\n00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:26,975\na few other things before it finally\ndumps me on my Windows 7 desktop.\n\n1131\n00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:28,540\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1132\n00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:33,750\nSo while you're actually waiting you of\ncourse can go through the manufacturer's\n\n1133\n00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,010\nbooks, and they might come with the\ncomputer or look through all of the disks.\n\n1134\n00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,623\nMost of the time today they don't even put\ndisks in with the computers anymore so\n\n1135\n00:53:38,623 --> 00:53:39,309\nyou can't even go through that.\n\n1136\n00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:41,086\n>> Yeah, not anymore.\n\n1137\n00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:45,160\nSo now I'm dumped at my\ndefault Windows 7 desktop.\n\n1138\n00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,756\nAnd I'm good to go.\n\n1139\n00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:49,332\nNow technically, the computer is ready\nto be used right now, but there's\n\n1140\n00:53:49,332 --> 00:53:53,520\na few follow up tasks that we're normally\ngoing to perform to get things going.\n\n1141\n00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,500\nAnd, one of the first ones I usually\nworry about is doing updates.\n\n1142\n00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,690\nWindows 7, when it was installed in your\nmachine, it could have been installed\n\n1143\n00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,950\nweeks or even months ago depending\non where you ordered it from.\n\n1144\n00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,400\nAnd even then, they may have\nmade the image prior to that.\n\n1145\n00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,770\nSo your machine is likely out of date.\n\n1146\n00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,170\nSo one of the first things we'll need to\ndo is get our machine on the network so\n\n1147\n00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,750\nthat we can reach out to the Internet and\nget connected.\n\n1148\n00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,980\nNow, I believe I'm already\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n1149\n00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,060\nI'm just going to verify that.\n\n1150\n00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,380\nI'll fire up Internet Explorer.\n\n1151\n00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,910\nAnd let's see if we can get out.\n\n1152\n00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,440\nSo Internet Explorer is asking me if\nI wanna run through some basic steps.\n\n1153\n00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,630\nNormally I would do this, but\n\n1154\n00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,250\nI can see that it is saying\nwelcome to Internet Explorer 8.\n\n1155\n00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,530\nAnd I know the current version\nis Internet Explorer 11 And so\n\n1156\n00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,420\nthis is pretty far behind.\n\n1157\n00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,350\nThere's not a whole lot of point in\nconfiguring in Internet Explorer 8\n\n1158\n00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,970\nwhen it's just going to get\nreplaced here in a moment.\n\n1159\n00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,100\nSo I'm just going to hit Ask Me Later.\n\n1160\n00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,460\nAnd I know that I'm out there and\n\n1161\n00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,220\non the Internet because I pulled up\na news site here, apparently, MSN.\n\n1162\n00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,043\nAnd if I look at MSN,\nI can see hopefully today's news.\n\n1163\n00:54:54,043 --> 00:54:55,842\nAnd this isn't some kind of cached page.\n\n1164\n00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,780\nThey don't put the date on their page.\n\n1165\n00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,604\nWho does that?\n\n1166\n00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:03,610\nSo, [LAUGH] well, anyhow,\nI see relevant news from today I guess.\n\n1167\n00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,200\nWell, no.\nThat's flashback stuff.\n\n1168\n00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,092\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Blood is everywhere, great.\n\n1169\n00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:08,556\n>> Oh.\n>> So anyhow, we can verify whether or\n\n1170\n00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:12,650\nnot we're actually getting out and\nconnecting to the Internet.\n\n1171\n00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,780\nThe main reason I want to see that\nI can connect to the internet,\n\n1172\n00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,370\nis I want to do my updates.\n\n1173\n00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,954\nSo I am just going to close that.\n\n1174\n00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:21,114\nAnd I'll bring up my start menu.\n\n1175\n00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:24,625\nAnd I'm just going to\ntype in this little box.\n\n1176\n00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:27,700\nActually, I'll just type it, update,\nso it'll find it right there.\n\n1177\n00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,580\nAnd so\nI am going to go do my Windows update.\n\n1178\n00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,732\nFor a Windows machine,\nit's always a good idea to do this.\n\n1179\n00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:36,130\nAnd you'll see it's warning me here\nbecause we've never checked for updates.\n\n1180\n00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,320\nThis is a new machine,\nso it's never been out.\n\n1181\n00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,224\nI'll go ahead and hit Check for Updates.\n\n1182\n00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:43,790\nIt's gonna reach out to Microsoft and\nfind some updates.\n\n1183\n00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:48,361\nNow, it will likely find many,\nmany, many updates.\n\n1184\n00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,088\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1185\n00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:52,673\nit's gonna have to download those and\nthen install them.\n\n1186\n00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:57,038\nAnd if your machine is several months\nbehind, This could take an hour or\n\n1187\n00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:59,454\nmore and it will reboot your computer.\n\n1188\n00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:02,370\nSo that's why I try and\ndo this right away.\n\n1189\n00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,762\nGet this started,\nthat way it'll finish earlier.\n\n1190\n00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:10,610\nAll right, another thing we need\nto do in addition to updates\n\n1191\n00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,130\nis to install some kind\nof security software.\n\n1192\n00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:18,926\nWindows 8 and Mac OS and\nmost versions of Linux\n\n1193\n00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:24,170\ncome with anti-spyware, anti-malware,\nthat kind of software built into them.\n\n1194\n00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,810\nBut Windows 7 didn't.\n\n1195\n00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,610\nSo if you're running Windows 7 and\nearlier,\n\n1196\n00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,890\nit doesn't have any anti-virus on it.\n\n1197\n00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,990\nSo sooner or\nlater it's gonna remind me of that.\n\n1198\n00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,010\nI'm gonna get a little pop-up telling\nme I need to do something about it.\n\n1199\n00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:39,860\nAnd when that happens, I can go in and\nupdate my system, but if I know\n\n1200\n00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,140\nahead of time that it's missing that then\nI just need to go and take care of it.\n\n1201\n00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,020\nSo, I'll go out and get that software.\n\n1202\n00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:51,563\nNow you might use McAfee Internet Suite or\nSymantec Security Suite anti-virus.\n\n1203\n00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:52,892\n>> AVG, anything like that.\n\n1204\n00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:54,420\n>> Oh, yeah AVG is a good one too.\n\n1205\n00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,450\nThere's a bunch of them\nthat are out there.\n\n1206\n00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,730\nIf you don't wanna pay any money,\n\n1207\n00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,860\none of the best ones is\nMicrosoft Security Essentials.\n\n1208\n00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,240\nMicrosoft actually has an anti-virus\nproduct that you can use that doesn't cost\n\n1209\n00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,370\nany money.\n\n1210\n00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:06,860\nSo I might wanna do that.\n\n1211\n00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,900\nSo I'll fire up my little\nweb browser again.\n\n1212\n00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,250\nAnd I'm just gonna use this\nsearch box here to search for\n\n1213\n00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,650\nMicrosoft Security Essentials.\n\n1214\n00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,970\nAnd here it is,\nright here on the first link.\n\n1215\n00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,746\nAnd see how it's got tabs here for\nWindows 7 and Windows 8.1?\n\n1216\n00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:26,590\nWindows 8.1 already has\nSecurity Essentials installed, so\n\n1217\n00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,290\nthere's not much for us to do.\n\n1218\n00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,370\nWell, that's fun.\n\n1219\n00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,730\nSo, apparently I have\ncrashed Internet Explorer.\n\n1220\n00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,700\nThat's awesome.\n\n1221\n00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,290\nSo but we normally just go to that\npage and then download and install it.\n\n1222\n00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,200\n>> Oh, there it is.\n\n1223\n00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,760\n>> There we go and it recovered from it.\n\n1224\n00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,460\nOh, I definitely wanna do their survey.\n\n1225\n00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,220\nBut you'll see right here,\nMicrosoft Security Essentials,\n\n1226\n00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,970\nI can download it right from their site.\n\n1227\n00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:51,220\nIt's free and it's anti-virus and\nanti-malware.\n\n1228\n00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,140\nThe nice thing about it is it does its\nupdates as a part of Windows updates.\n\n1229\n00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,160\nSo if you have Windows\nupdating automatically,\n\n1230\n00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,540\nthis is updating automatically, too.\n\n1231\n00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,380\nSo it's all, kinda, wrapped into one.\n\n1232\n00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,740\nAnd it works out really well.\n\n1233\n00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,050\n>> Right.\n\n1234\n00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,110\n>> Now, asking people what their favorite\n\n1235\n00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,090\nantivirus program\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1236\n00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,420\n>> is is like asking somebody about\n\n1237\n00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:07,930\npolitics.\n\n1238\n00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,810\nThere's a million different\nchoices out there, and\n\n1239\n00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,390\neverybody has different preferences.\n\n1240\n00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,490\nSo don't feel like you have to use this.\n\n1241\n00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,150\nIf you have another one that you like,\nthen definitely use it.\n\n1242\n00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,788\nI'd personally prefer Trend Micro,\n\n1243\n00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:21,046\nI've had really good results\nwith their software.\n\n1244\n00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:25,127\nBut there's SophosLabs, Symantec,\nMcAfee, Panda, Kaspersky,\n\n1245\n00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:28,860\nthere's a ton of other\ncompanies out there that do it.\n\n1246\n00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,540\nAnd in fact had I not\ninstalled antivirus software,\n\n1247\n00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,580\neventually it would prompt me and\nMicrosoft would give me a page that\n\n1248\n00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,600\ndisplays all the different\noptions that are out there.\n\n1249\n00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,850\nNow it is asking me if I want to do\nthe 64-bit or 32-bit installation here.\n\n1250\n00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,780\nWhich one do I want Ronnie?\n\n1251\n00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n1252\n00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,690\nYou always want to make sure that you\npick the one that's appropriate for\n\n1253\n00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,250\nyour operating system.\n\n1254\n00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,040\nSo if you're not sure.\n\n1255\n00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,710\nThere is a place that you can go and\ncheck and\n\n1256\n00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,890\nsee whether your computer's\nactually 64-bit or 32-bit.\n\n1257\n00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:58,480\nWhat we need to do is get to what we\ncall the System Properties window.\n\n1258\n00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,240\nWe go ahead and click on Start.\n\n1259\n00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,330\nWe can then right click\non the word Computer, and\n\n1260\n00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,690\ngo down to that last option\nthat says Properties.\n\n1261\n00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,830\nAnd once the System Properties\nwindows opens up,\n\n1262\n00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,344\nwe should be able to see right there,\nwhere it says System Type.\n\n1263\n00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:18,300\nThat this is a 64-bit operating system and\nthat's the one that you really want to\n\n1264\n00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,295\nget, is the one that matches\nyour operating system.\n\n1265\n00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:24,120\n>> Yes, so\nI can see right here this one says AMD 64.\n\n1266\n00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,695\nNow I've got an Intel processor,\nnot an AMD but,\n\n1267\n00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:30,744\nthe Intel processors are actually using\nthe 64-bit standard set by AMD, so\n\n1268\n00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:33,646\nthat's why it says that and\nthat's the one that I want.\n\n1269\n00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:36,541\nSo I'll just check that and\nwe'll get that downloaded too.\n\n1270\n00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:40,455\nNow I'm gonna start it downloading, and\nwhile it's downloading, I'm gonna jump\n\n1271\n00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,830\nback over and check out my updates,\nI haven't checked in on my updates.\n\n1272\n00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,780\nOh, actually it blocked a pop-up,\nthat's awesome.\n\n1273\n00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,890\nSo that's telling me if my download does\nnot start after 30 seconds click here.\n\n1274\n00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,180\nI'm just gonna go ahead and click there,\nand apparently, I need to unblock\n\n1275\n00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,790\nthe pop-up, so let's go ahead and say,\nalways allow pop-ups from this site.\n\n1276\n00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,400\nYes, yes, yes, protecting me from myself.\n\n1277\n01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,140\n>> That's it.\n\n1278\n01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,150\n>> All right, so we'll try that again.\n\n1279\n01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,900\nSo, I'll get that downloading and\nwhile it's downloading,\n\n1280\n01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,440\nI will check on my windows updates\nto see how they're moving along.\n\n1281\n01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,160\nSo is this.\n\n1282\n01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:11,780\n>> I can't tell.\n\n1283\n01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,960\n>> I know,\nthis is the moment of truth, right.\n\n1284\n01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,530\nLet's click on this and see what happens.\n\n1285\n01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:20,350\nAnd, see, this is a problem with\nrunning an old web browser.\n\n1286\n01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,260\nSo I'm still running IE8.\n\n1287\n01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,380\nInternet Explorer 8.\n\n1288\n01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,730\nAnd it's possible this website doesn't\nhave good compatibility with that.\n\n1289\n01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,644\nAnd I see my download is just not working\nhere and that's more than likely tied to,\n\n1290\n01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:30,961\nactually, you know what?\n\n1291\n01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:31,961\nIs it in the background?\n\n1292\n01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,496\n>> Yeah, something's glowing. Yep, it is.\n>> Oh, it's in the background.\n\n1293\n01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,539\nThey got me.\n\n1294\n01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:35,802\n>> So there it is.\n\n1295\n01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:38,410\nI'm gonna go ahead and just choose\nto run that and let it churn along.\n\n1296\n01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,983\nHow many of those windows do I have?\n\n1297\n01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:43,555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n1298\n01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:46,425\nBut, if you bump into a situation\nlike that, where it won't download,\n\n1299\n01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:48,715\nthen you may just need to wait for\nyour updates to finish.\n\n1300\n01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:51,355\nAnd then you'll find that you're on IE10,\nor IE11.\n\n1301\n01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:54,265\nAnd then you'll be able to go out,\nand do that update.\n\n1302\n01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:55,945\nOr, you could do what I do.\n\n1303\n01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:58,195\nWhich is I usually fire up\nInternet Explorer, and then go and\n\n1304\n01:00:58,195 --> 01:00:59,636\ndownload Google Chrome with it.\n\n1305\n01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:00,197\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1306\n01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:02,237\nyou might chose to go and\ninstall other software.\n\n1307\n01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:04,640\nAnd that's part of the steps\nthat CompTIA calls out.\n\n1308\n01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,420\nAfter our basic updates are done,\nwe normally go and\n\n1309\n01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,600\ninstall our own personal software that\nmakes the computer do what we need.\n\n1310\n01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,788\nAnd there's no limit to that,\nyou just go in and\n\n1311\n01:01:13,788 --> 01:01:16,550\nput whatever it is that\nyou want on your computer.\n\n1312\n01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,130\nI'm just kinda moving\nthrough this install here.\n\n1313\n01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,800\nI'm not gonna join their\ncustomer experience program.\n\n1314\n01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,170\nBut otherwise it's just basic security\nsettings here asking if I want my\n\n1315\n01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,370\nfirewall turned on.\n\n1316\n01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,600\nAsking if I want automatic\nsample submission.\n\n1317\n01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,780\n>> These are the things that we typically\nwant on so I'll leave those be.\n\n1318\n01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,990\nAnd now it's gonna install this\nantivirus software for me so\n\n1319\n01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,255\nnow my system will be protected and\none less thing to worry about.\n\n1320\n01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:38,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1321\n01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,850\n>> Let's see what else's is on our\nlist while we're waiting on it.\n\n1322\n01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,140\nOh, I wanted to check on our updates.\n\n1323\n01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,000\nLet me go see the status of my updates.\n\n1324\n01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,749\nI left them in the background.\n\n1325\n01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:47,012\n>> Oh, only 167 important updates.\n\n1326\n01:01:47,012 --> 01:01:48,800\n>> 167 important updates.\n\n1327\n01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,261\nThat is a lot of updates.\n\n1328\n01:01:50,261 --> 01:01:51,050\n>> That is.\nNow,\n\n1329\n01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:55,090\nI'm gonna pass on this scan because\nit will slow my computer down.\n\n1330\n01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,290\nIn real life, I'd probably do that scan,\nbut finished that.\n\n1331\n01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,276\nAll right, now,\nit says that it's only 671 megabytes.\n\n1332\n01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:02,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not too bad, right?\n\n1333\n01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,420\nWe can download that pretty quickly.\n\n1334\n01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,494\nBut the problem here is even\nthough it's 671 megabytes,\n\n1335\n01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:12,360\napplying 167 updates is\ngoing to take a long time.\n\n1336\n01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,620\nSo we just need to hit Install Updates and\nlet that churn along.\n\n1337\n01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,060\nIt's gonna take awhile.\n\n1338\n01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,470\nLet it run, all right.\n\n1339\n01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,075\nNow while it's doing that.\n\n1340\n01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:24,420\nOh, it's asking me to make sure\nI accept my license terms.\n\n1341\n01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,375\nWhile it's doing that, I can see Microsoft\nSecurity Essentials is complaining in\n\n1342\n01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:31,160\nthe background and\nthe reason is it's out of date.\n\n1343\n01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,000\nSo, it's going to warn me about that.\n\n1344\n01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,960\nAnd here it's actually reaching out and\ndoing the update automatically.\n\n1345\n01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,840\nIt's pretty smart about going and\ndoing that stuff.\n\n1346\n01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,130\nBut that's my warning here,\nbecause I'm out of date.\n\n1347\n01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,010\nAnd it's updating right now.\n\n1348\n01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:41,710\nI didn't have to tell it.\n\n1349\n01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,030\nIt's just doing it on its own.\n\n1350\n01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:47,910\nAll right, so,\nlet's just minimize all that stuff.\n\n1351\n01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,530\nThose are gonna run and\nthey're gonna take a while.\n\n1352\n01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:52,080\nSo, I'm just gonna put those out of mind.\n\n1353\n01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,450\nWhat are some of the other things that\nwe need you to do to get this system\n\n1354\n01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,370\nthe way we want it, all right.\n\n1355\n01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:00,970\nWell, when we created this system it\nasked me to create a user account, and so\n\n1356\n01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,630\nI made a user account for myself.\n\n1357\n01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,160\nBut what if you've got a wife, kids,\n\n1358\n01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,610\nother people that you wanna\nshare this system with.\n\n1359\n01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,280\nYou might wanna create user accounts for\nthem too.\n\n1360\n01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,840\nSo that might be the next\nstep that we go through.\n\n1361\n01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,160\nSo, for that, we're just going to\ndive into our Start Menu here.\n\n1362\n01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,490\nAnd I'll go to my Control Panel.\n\n1363\n01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,280\nAnd inside of the Control Panel you'll\nsee User Accounts and Family Safety and\n\n1364\n01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,760\nthat's where we can go to add in\nuser accounts for each person.\n\n1365\n01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,640\nAnd if they're children, we can turn\non Family Safety Parental Controls that\n\n1366\n01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,930\nrestrict what they're allowed to access\nand how they can use the computer.\n\n1367\n01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:37,130\nBut at a minimum we're gonna go to\nUser Accounts and we'll see the accounts.\n\n1368\n01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:42,270\nI've got that John Doe and I can start to\nadd additional user accounts if I want.\n\n1369\n01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:45,964\nAnd oh you know actually I did\nclick on the wrong spot, didn't I?\n\n1370\n01:03:45,964 --> 01:03:50,216\nSo see how it doesn't really give me\nthe option here to create another account?\n\n1371\n01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:51,894\nIf I go back, it was back here.\n\n1372\n01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,284\nWe've got user accounts and\nadd or remove user accounts.\n\n1373\n01:03:55,284 --> 01:04:00,140\nThat's were I should have gone, and so if\nI click on that, we'll get in there now.\n\n1374\n01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,170\nI can see that I've got that John Doe\naccount, there's that Don Paset account\n\n1375\n01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,220\ncreeping in there,\napparently that's in my image somehow.\n\n1376\n01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,390\nI'm going to just remove that guy\nreal quick, I'm going to delete Don.\n\n1377\n01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,842\nSee you later, buddy.\n\n1378\n01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:12,880\nAll right, so we'll get him out of there,\nbut we'd go through and\n\n1379\n01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,670\nadd each of the accounts\nthat we needed for\n\n1380\n01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,920\nour family or whoever, and\nthen we can move on from there.\n\n1381\n01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,780\nAnd apparently\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1382\n01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,680\n>> It's thinking.\n\n1383\n01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,060\n>> There we go.\n\n1384\n01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,860\nAll right, let me just cancel out of that.\n\n1385\n01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,390\nAll right, so here's the user\naccounts that I've got on my system.\n\n1386\n01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:31,960\nNow, you'll have the account that\nyou created during your install and\n\n1387\n01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,430\nyou'll have a guest account.\n\n1388\n01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,680\nAnd the guest account should be off.\n\n1389\n01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,740\nSee how it says guest account is off.\n\n1390\n01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,700\nThat's if you want to allow\nsomebody to use the computer\n\n1391\n01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,100\nwho doesn't have a log in.\n\n1392\n01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:41,750\nNo password.\n\n1393\n01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,300\nThey just sit down, and\nthey're able to use the computer.\n\n1394\n01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,780\nYou typically don't want that, unless\nyou've got some kind of shared computer.\n\n1395\n01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,960\nMaybe in a school lab or\nsomething like that, but\n\n1396\n01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,510\nit's not something we commonly use.\n\n1397\n01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,770\nWe normally leave that off, and\nthen we just go down here and\n\n1398\n01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:55,650\nhit Create New Account.\n\n1399\n01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,350\nAnd we start to add accounts for\nour other family members.\n\n1400\n01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,360\nSo I might go in here, and let's say that,\nRonnie, you're gonna be using this, right?\n\n1401\n01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,620\nSo I'm gonna create a Ronnie Wong,\nuser account.\n\n1402\n01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,830\nAnd I can make him just a regular user,\n\n1403\n01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,430\nwhere he won't be able to make\nmodifications to the system.\n\n1404\n01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:12,670\nOr I can make him an administrator.\n\n1405\n01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:16,270\nAnd now he can do whatever he wants to\nthe system, so I've got that choice.\n\n1406\n01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,290\nRonnie you're a standard user.\n\n1407\n01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,690\nI do not trust.\n\n1408\n01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,540\nDo not trust you.\n\n1409\n01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,220\n>> I don't blame you.\n\n1410\n01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,100\n>> So we'll go ahead and\ncreate that and now we got Ronnie.\n\n1411\n01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,370\nAnd, it didn't ask about a password.\n\n1412\n01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:28,010\nThe account is not password\nprotected right now.\n\n1413\n01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:30,150\nSo he could come and log in this machine.\n\n1414\n01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,120\nAnd he doesn't even need a password.\n\n1415\n01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,970\nHe can choose that one if he wants.\n\n1416\n01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,850\nOr if we click on it,\nwe can add a password.\n\n1417\n01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,740\nWe can create a password for that account,\nand then it'll be password-protected.\n\n1418\n01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,950\nSo I'll go ahead and do that,\n\n1419\n01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:47,170\njust because I think it is\na great idea to have a password.\n\n1420\n01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:47,959\nAnd I hate hints.\n\n1421\n01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:50,900\nAll right, so we'll get that put on there.\n\n1422\n01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,520\nAnd now we've got the Ronnie account.\n\n1423\n01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,840\nCool part about multiple accounts is we\ncan switch back and forth between them,\n\n1424\n01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,940\nand multiple people can personalize\nthe computer, make it their own.\n\n1425\n01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,175\nI think the only other thing that\nI've left out at this point is, oh,\n\n1426\n01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:06,700\nwe had two things.\n\n1427\n01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,740\nConfigure peripherals.\n\n1428\n01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,300\nNow, I hooked a keyboard\nup to this computer.\n\n1429\n01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,180\nI hooked a mouse up.\n\n1430\n01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,540\nRonnie, you hooked the speakers up to it,\nright?\n\n1431\n01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,720\n>> Right.\nSo, we hooked these different things up.\n\n1432\n01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,030\nWell, Windows 7 automatically detected all\nof them and we didn't have to do anything.\n\n1433\n01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,030\nThat's one of the nicer\nparts about Windows 7.\n\n1434\n01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,250\nIt's got a lot of drivers built into it.\n\n1435\n01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:27,190\nSo, you may be good to go right off, and\n\n1436\n01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,340\nnot have to worry about\nperipherals at all.\n\n1437\n01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,150\nBut if you have a printer up,\nor a scanner, or\n\n1438\n01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:36,290\nsome other kind of device, Windows\nmight not have the driver available.\n\n1439\n01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,140\nSo now's a great time to install\nthe drivers for that hardware.\n\n1440\n01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,880\nNow, I don't know if I have\nany undetected hardware.\n\n1441\n01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,450\nIt's not asking about it, so\nI think we're in good shape.\n\n1442\n01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,540\nif you ever wanna check though,\nyou can bring up your start menu.\n\n1443\n01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:52,350\nRight click on computer and\ngo to properties.\n\n1444\n01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:58,130\nAnd inside of the system properties\nthere's this device manager.\n\n1445\n01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,550\nAnd when you go into device manager,\n\n1446\n01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,840\nit's gonna list all the hardware\nattached to your computer.\n\n1447\n01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,230\nAnd if you see anything in\nhere with a question mark.\n\n1448\n01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,980\nOr a yellow triangle with\nan exclamation point in it.\n\n1449\n01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,580\nThose are indicators that you've got\nhardware that's missing its driver.\n\n1450\n01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,320\nAnd so you might need to install\nadditional software to get those\n\n1451\n01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,760\nperipherals working.\n\n1452\n01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,850\nIt's not uncommon with\nthings like wireless mice.\n\n1453\n01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,870\nJoystick and game controllers, printers.\n\n1454\n01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:27,347\nThese are all things we may\nattach that need drivers.\n\n1455\n01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:28,822\nAll right.\n\n1456\n01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:32,331\nAnd then the other thing,\nwhen you purchase a computer at retail,\n\n1457\n01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:36,589\nin other words, if you go to a department\nstore and you buy a computer from there,\n\n1458\n01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:41,280\nlike Best Buy or whatever, even if you\norder it from Dell or HP sometimes.\n\n1459\n01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,740\nA lot of times you'll find where\nthere's extra software on the computer\n\n1460\n01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,080\nthat is just garbage.\n\n1461\n01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,890\nIt's not needed, it's extra clutter that's\ngonna slow down your machine because it's\n\n1462\n01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,015\nrunning in the background.\n\n1463\n01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:55,025\nNow personally, when I get a new\ncomputer one of the first things I do is\n\n1464\n01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:58,705\nerase it and set it up from scratch,\nbecause that's what I like to do.\n\n1465\n01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:02,375\nBut you don't have to,\nwhat you should really do is,\n\n1466\n01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:06,430\nif you don't want that extra\nsoftware there, uninstall it.\n\n1467\n01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,930\nBack in our control panel we can,\nlet me just close all that.\n\n1468\n01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,020\nI can go back into my control panel,\nso I'm just gonna go to start, and\n\n1469\n01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,590\ncontrol panel.\n\n1470\n01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,690\nAnd inside the control panel,\n\n1471\n01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,380\nyou're gonna see down here programs and\nuninstall a program.\n\n1472\n01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,620\nAnd you can choose that and\n\n1473\n01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:24,330\nit will list all the things that\nare installed in your machine.\n\n1474\n01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,240\nMine is really clean.\n\n1475\n01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,050\nBecause I used one of my\ninstallation disks and\n\n1476\n01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,480\nI didn't put anything extra on there.\n\n1477\n01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:35,160\nBut you might see all sorts of Dell\nsoftware or online gaming software.\n\n1478\n01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,896\n>> Yeah.\n>> All sorts of junk in there that you\n\n1479\n01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:38,120\njust don't care about.\n\n1480\n01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,040\nI'm trying to think about some good\nexamples that are pretty common.\n\n1481\n01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,930\n>> The one that I know from\nmy last computer purchase is,\n\n1482\n01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,440\nsomething called WildTangent.\n\n1483\n01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,670\nThey add in everything in the world\nunder there, and when you go here,\n\n1484\n01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,800\nyou can actually go ahead and\nuninstall it from there.\n\n1485\n01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,590\nA lot of time we actually\nkind of give it a name.\n\n1486\n01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,270\nWe call it bloatware a lot of times.\n\n1487\n01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,620\nBecause, that's all it's really doing.\n\n1488\n01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,090\nIt's bloating your computer.\n\n1489\n01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,200\nAnd you may go and\nplay a game from maybe the trial period.\n\n1490\n01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,285\nBut you may not want to pay for it.\n\n1491\n01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:05,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1492\n01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:06,620\n>> So, a lot of time,\n\n1493\n01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,640\nuninstalling it from right here\nis probably the best thing to do.\n\n1494\n01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,840\n>> Yeah, or even legitimate\nsoftware like Microsoft Office.\n\n1495\n01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,528\nThere might be a trial version of\nMicrosoft Office installed on there and\n\n1496\n01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,230\nit's pretty expensive.\n\n1497\n01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,868\nSo you may not choose to buy it.\n\n1498\n01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:22,780\nWell, it's eating up about\na gigabyte of hard drive space,\n\n1499\n01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,630\nso if you're not gonna\nbuy it uninstall it.\n\n1500\n01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,570\nJust come in here and select the software.\n\n1501\n01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,640\nAnd, so I can take like,\nSecurity Essentials, and\n\n1502\n01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,760\nI can just hit uninstall and\njust remove it, all right.\n\n1503\n01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,800\nThe only problem is sometimes\nthe software is important.\n\n1504\n01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,960\nIt might serve some kind of a function.\n\n1505\n01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,470\nSo, be on the lookout for\nsoftware that looks like a driver, so\n\n1506\n01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,760\nyou might have something like\nSynaptics TouchPad software.\n\n1507\n01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,270\nAnd you look at that, and\nyou're like what the heck is that.\n\n1508\n01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,090\nI don't want that.\n\n1509\n01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:49,150\nWell, it's the driver for your touchpad.\n\n1510\n01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:51,730\nSo, your special gestures and swipes and\n\n1511\n01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,040\nstuff might not work if\nyou don't have that.\n\n1512\n01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,380\nOr you might see something\nlike hot key support.\n\n1513\n01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,690\nAnd if your keyboard has special buttons\nacross the top that are shortcuts for\n\n1514\n01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:03,870\nthings, you might be disabling those\nbuttons by uninstalling the software.\n\n1515\n01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,900\nSo make sure that it's not\nsomething that you actually need.\n\n1516\n01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,964\nIf you don't know what the software does,\nyou're usually better off just leaving it.\n\n1517\n01:10:11,085 --> 01:10:11,675\n>> And now I'm just,\n\n1518\n01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,635\njust one last thing even though\nit's not on the exam objectives.\n\n1519\n01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:15,180\nI noticed there's a little\nballoon popping up.\n\n1520\n01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,735\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That may be something we need to take\n\n1521\n01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:18,545\ncare of when we first install a computer.\n\n1522\n01:10:18,545 --> 01:10:19,750\n>> Yeah, hopefully you don't.\n\n1523\n01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,465\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When you buy a new computer,\n\n1524\n01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:25,797\nit should come with a license for\nWindows already installed on it.\n\n1525\n01:10:25,797 --> 01:10:27,117\nAnd so the first time you boot up,\n\n1526\n01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:29,407\nyour computer is gonna do\nwhat's called phoning home.\n\n1527\n01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:33,227\nIt's gonna reach out to Microsoft and\nit's gonna say hey, I'm booting up.\n\n1528\n01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:34,227\nIs my license valid?\n\n1529\n01:10:34,227 --> 01:10:35,337\nAnd Microsoft will say yes.\n\n1530\n01:10:35,337 --> 01:10:36,870\nAnd that's it.\nYou won't see it.\n\n1531\n01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,760\nAll right?\n\n1532\n01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,750\nMy computer, on the other hand, when I\nturned it on, it reached out to Microsoft\n\n1533\n01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,190\nand said, is my license valid, and\nMicrosoft said no, it's not, right?\n\n1534\n01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,160\nAnd the reason was I\nnever put a license in.\n\n1535\n01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,950\nRight?\nI never entered one in.\n\n1536\n01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,560\nSo I might need to do that.\n\n1537\n01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,130\nYou need to enter in a product key.\n\n1538\n01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:57,280\nAnd if your computer ships with\nWindows pre-installed on it,\n\n1539\n01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,220\nsomewhere on that case, on the outside of\nthat computer, there should be a sticker\n\n1540\n01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:06,480\nwith a 25 character code that\nrepresents your license.\n\n1541\n01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,450\nIf it's not there then the version of\nWindows on your machine is more than\n\n1542\n01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:11,600\nlikely illegal.\n\n1543\n01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,430\nIf you buy computers from,\n\n1544\n01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,660\nfrom like, small shops or\nthey call them white label, right?\n\n1545\n01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,410\nWhere they're not a name brand computer?\n\n1546\n01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,260\nThere are some companies\nthat cut corners and try and\n\n1547\n01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,210\nsave money by selling systems with\nthe illegal operating systems.\n\n1548\n01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:26,620\nSo you gotta be careful about that,\nand make sure it's genuine software.\n\n1549\n01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,780\nSo, what would happen is if I had clicked\nthat bubble it would've then asked me\n\n1550\n01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,200\nto punch in that code.\n\n1551\n01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,720\nAnd so I'd read it right off the case and\ntype it in on the system,\n\n1552\n01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,140\nand then when I hit submit,\nit would phone home to Microsoft,\n\n1553\n01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,410\nMicrosoft would activate it,\nand that would go away.\n\n1554\n01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,860\nNow, if you're unsure of\nwhether you're activated or\n\n1555\n01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,330\nnot, you can go right back to\nthat system control panel that\n\n1556\n01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,710\nwe've gone to multiple times now,\nbut, let me do that.\n\n1557\n01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:51,854\nI'll go to Start, I'll right-click on\nComputer and go to Properties, and\n\n1558\n01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:55,934\nright here in that Properties screen I\ncan look down and it's at the bottom,\n\n1559\n01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:59,469\nI've got to scroll down, and\nhere I can see Windows Activation.\n\n1560\n01:11:59,469 --> 01:12:01,209\n20 days to activate.\n\n1561\n01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:02,253\nI can activate now.\n\n1562\n01:12:02,253 --> 01:12:07,128\nIf I don't do it in 20 days, my system\nwill boot up, it'll ask me to activate,\n\n1563\n01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:09,960\nand if I say no,\nit'll shut down, all right.\n\n1564\n01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,070\nSo I won't be able to use\nthe computer anymore after 20 days\n\n1565\n01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:12,710\nunless I activate it.\n\n1566\n01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,030\nAnd you'll see where I can change\nmy product key right here.\n\n1567\n01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,540\nAnd if I click that,\n\n1568\n01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,150\nhere's where I can type in that 25\ncharacter code, get it activated, and go.\n\n1569\n01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,580\nAll right?\n\n1570\n01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,350\nSo, be aware of that process, that is\ngonna be required to activate the machine.\n\n1571\n01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,930\nIf you're buying from Dell or HP,\nthey've already put the code in for\n\n1572\n01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,420\nyou, and it'll phone home, and activate,\nand you don't have to do anything,\n\n1573\n01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,710\nyou probably don't even know it happens.\n\n1574\n01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,500\nIt's all in the background, all right.\n\n1575\n01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,547\nBut if you buy from a smaller shop,\nyou may have to get involved in this.\n\n1576\n01:12:41,547 --> 01:12:45,620\nAll right, but at that point we just\nkinda wait for our updates to finish.\n\n1577\n01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:49,630\nYou can use the computer while it's doing\nupdates, but it's not a great idea and\n\n1578\n01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:52,580\nthe main reason is that there are a lot of\nsecurity fixes that are coming in, and so\n\n1579\n01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:56,480\nthat if you start browsing the internet,\nyou're vulnerable while you do that.\n\n1580\n01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,464\nSo it is a good idea to wait for\nthe updates to finish.\n\n1581\n01:12:58,464 --> 01:13:01,060\nMine are probably still churning along.\n\n1582\n01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,180\nIt says oh, it's just still downloading.\n\n1583\n01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:03,846\nIt's only 98% complete.\n\n1584\n01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:06,213\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It hasn't even installed the first\n\n1585\n01:13:06,213 --> 01:13:06,860\nupdate yet.\n\n1586\n01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,540\n>> No.\n>> So, it's gonna do this for\n\n1587\n01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:11,080\na while this machine will probably\nbe tied up for a good hour or two.\n\n1588\n01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,920\nBut you definitely wanna get this done.\n\n1589\n01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:18,580\nAll right, after that, our workstation's\nup and ready to go, right?\n\n1590\n01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,730\nThose are the basic steps we take\nwhen setting up a new machine.\n\n1591\n01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n1592\n01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,850\nSo, from straight out of the box,\nall the way to when we first log in, and\n\n1593\n01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,370\ngetting the system ready for\n\n1594\n01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:32,340\nactual use, we've taken you through\nthat process in this episode.\n\n1595\n01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,670\nSo we've seen every component that we,\nthe most basic ones that we need\n\n1596\n01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:40,190\nall the way through to that initial setup,\nso it was a pretty good show.\n\n1597\n01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n1598\n01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,380\nAll right, well, this is definitely\na good spot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n1599\n01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:47,600\nWe've got more basic IT Literacy\nepisodes coming down the pipe, so\n\n1600\n01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,070\nstay tuned for those.\n\n1601\n01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,570\nBut for today,\nwe're going to wrap it up here.\n\n1602\n01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,930\nSo let me remind you, if you have\nquestions on any of this, like you're\n\n1603\n01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,710\nsetting up your computer and it

00:00:31,959\nAnd good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:35,310\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here on IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,010\nMy name is Ronnie Wong, and\nI'll be your host today,\n\n7\n00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,800\nas we dive into the realm of\n[INAUDIBLE] IT fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480\nAs we get started in IT fundamentals,\n\n9\n00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,910\nwe've already gone through\nseveral different episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,630\nMake sure you check those out a-,\nas you continue to go through the library.\n\n11\n00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,010\nToday we're beginning\non our final objective,\n\n12\n00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,720\nwhich is objective number five,\non the basic IT literacy.\n\n13\n00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,560\nBasic IT literacy means that you have\na familiarity with the concepts and\n\n14\n00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,960\nthe terminologies of the IT world.\n\n15\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760\nNow, it doesn't mean that you'll\nknow everything about it,\n\n16\n00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,730\nas you get further and further along into\nyour career, you'll learn more and more.\n\n17\n00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,770\nBut at this point we're really dealing\nwith navigating around the operating\n\n18\n00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,930\nsystem, and we wanna make sure that you\nhave a fairly good concept and understand\n\n19\n00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,810\nsome of the ways that you can get\naround the operating system quickly and\n\n20\n00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,510\nsome of the things that you\nhave to do as an IT technician.\n\n21\n00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,860\nSo we wanna go ahead and\njump right into that.\n\n22\n00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,290\nAnd what I've got is a Windows 7 machine\nthat I've got here on my on my laptop.\n\n23\n00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,200\nI'm gonna be using this for\n\n24\n00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,110\nour demonstrations as we\ncontinue to go through.\n\n25\n00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,180\nSo, one of the things that we have to be\nable to understand if we're not there yet,\n\n26\n00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,980\nis of course, making sure that\nprograms will run on our system.\n\n27\n00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,520\nAfter installing a program,\ngetting the program to execute or\n\n28\n00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,910\nrun is one of the primary functions\nthat we have to be able to check out and\n\n29\n00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,360\nmake sure that it's actually working.\n\n30\n00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,440\nSometimes what can happen is that you\ninstall a program on to a system, but\n\n31\n00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,150\nyet the program isn't running yet.\n\n32\n00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,790\nSo let's go ahead and\nverify that we know how to run a program.\n\n33\n00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,550\nNow that sounds easy enough but\n\n34\n00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,310\nlet's just make sure that that\nwe can check and, and do this.\n\n35\n00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,250\nNow there's normally a couple\nof ways where you and\n\n36\n00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,560\nI can actually do something like this.\n\n37\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,500\nAnd, so as we do that over here in Windows\n7, usually the default way is that if\n\n38\n00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,740\nyou don't see a lot of what we call short\ncuts here on the desktop, I've got one,\n\n39\n00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,320\nbecause I've got a program\nthat I've installed on here.\n\n40\n00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,530\nBut if you don't see it,\n\n41\n00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,290\nwe need to make sure that we know\nwhere to go to execute a program.\n\n42\n00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,160\nUsually what happens here in\nWindows 7 is down in the lower left\n\n43\n00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,310\nhand corner of the screen,\nwe have the nice Windows start button.\n\n44\n00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,320\nIf I go ahead and\nclick on the start button,\n\n45\n00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,550\nyou have this start menu that\nyou have available to you.\n\n46\n00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,140\nAnd sometimes the programs can be executed\ndirectly from the start menu here,\n\n47\n00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,050\nother times, if the program is not\nshowing up in the shortcut list, I can,\n\n48\n00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,560\ninstead, select the link down here at\nthe bottom that says all programs.\n\n49\n00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,990\nAnd within the all programs menu,\nyou end up seeing that there's a list of\n\n50\n00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,780\ndifferent programs that you can also see,\nthat are listed right here.\n\n51\n00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060\nNow all of these are what\nwe call shortcuts.\n\n52\n00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,180\nWe'll talk about what a shortcut\nactually is in a moment.\n\n53\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,220\nBut shortcuts, are, are listed up here.\n\n54\n00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,980\nAnd then,\n\n55\n00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,610\nunderneath that we also have what we call\ndifferent folders that we can access.\n\n56\n00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,880\nSo inside of this folder that, is called\naccessories, if I click once there, then\n\n57\n00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,940\nI can see that there are other programs\nthat are actually within that sub-folder.\n\n58\n00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,590\nSo I can launch up\na simple word processor.\n\n59\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,260\nBy simply selecting it,\nand then here it is.\n\n60\n00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,590\nThe program's actually up and running.\n\n61\n00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,020\nSo executing a program is not the most\ndifficult thing in the world to do, but\n\n62\n00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,280\nremember that sometimes what\ncan end up happening for\n\n63\n00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,260\nsomebody that's not used\nto working on a computer,\n\n64\n00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,000\nis that they can't remember how to get\nexactly to this word processing program.\n\n65\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,560\nAnd they need instead to be able\nto get access to it very quickly.\n\n66\n00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,870\nYou and\nI can then create what we call a shortcut.\n\n67\n00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,090\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n68\n00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,780\nSo, if I were to ask you, how do I get\naccess to that WordPad program again?\n\n69\n00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,800\nYou may already know, because\nyou're familiar with the offerings.\n\n70\n00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,760\nBut for somebody that's not as familiar,\nthe easiest thing that you and\n\n71\n00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,470\nI can do is create what\nwe call a short cut.\n\n72\n00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,990\nA short cut is not exactly\nthe location of where that,\n\n73\n00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,920\nthat executable was, but\nit actually is a link to the executable.\n\n74\n00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,190\nSo, let me show you the example\nthat shortcut again.\n\n75\n00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,450\nIf I go down to the Start button,\nand I go to all Programs.\n\n76\n00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,620\nAnd in all Programs,\nI go to the accessories subfolder here.\n\n77\n00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,760\nAnd notice that there's WordPad.\n\n78\n00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,350\nWordPad doesn't exist right here It\nexists in a different file location.\n\n79\n00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,240\nIf I right click on Wordpad, I have this\n\n80\n00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,820\nnice shortcut menu or\nthis nice menu here that pops up.\n\n81\n00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,900\nAnd then I can see this third option\nthat tells me to, open a file location.\n\n82\n00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,190\nWhen I select that,\ni can see up at the top, here.\n\n83\n00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,070\nOn the top,\nthis is called our Bread Crumb bar.\n\n84\n00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,200\nWhere it's located on the computer,\non the hard drive local disk C.\n\n85\n00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,110\nWithin a sub folder called Program Files,\n\n86\n00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,240\nwhich also has a sub\nfolder called Windows NT.\n\n87\n00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,106\nInside of another sub-folder\ncalled Accessories, and\n\n88\n00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:39,960\nthen I see where that\nprogram actually exists.\n\n89\n00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,380\nRight here I can see where\nit says Application.\n\n90\n00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,040\nThe File Size is about 4 megs, and\nthere is the program called Wordpad.\n\n91\n00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,560\nWell, I can't send somebody\nthere each time, so\n\n92\n00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,890\nWindows automatically created\na shortcut for you and me.\n\n93\n00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,160\nBy putting it in the Accessories\nfolder and then into the Start menu.\n\n94\n00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,240\nBut you and\nI can go one step further than that,\n\n95\n00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,210\nby simply right clicking on that file and\nthen we can go to this send to link.\n\n96\n00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,660\nSend to gives me the ability then, to go\nahead and create a shortcut on the desktop\n\n97\n00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,520\nand that will directly link me\nto this file location here.\n\n98\n00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,000\nIf I go ahead and close out of that\nwindow, you can see now on my desktop,\n\n99\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000\nI have now created a shortcut for WordPad.\n\n100\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,330\nInstead of me now having\nto go into the Start menu,\n\n101\n00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,590\nI can simply go ahead and click on it.\n\n102\n00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,940\nAnd that launches up WordPad.\n\n103\n00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,307\nAnd now I can type.\n\n104\n00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:49,861\nThen, once I have whatever\nit is I'm going to type,\n\n105\n00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:54,809\nI can then save it by clicking on\nthis little dark blue bar, and\n\n106\n00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:59,680\nI can go to the Save button, and\nnow I can save this as my file.\n\n107\n00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,200\nSo, I'm just gonna call it file1.\n\n108\n00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,470\nNow, I do need to be careful\nabout saving a file.\n\n109\n00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,640\nSometimes files can be saved and I don't\nknow exactly where it's gonna be located.\n\n110\n00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,320\nIt's always good to have it,\n\n111\n00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,730\nto make sure that you note where\nthis file's gonna be located.\n\n112\n00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,650\nAnd you can see, it's actually under\nsomething called Libraries, and\n\n113\n00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,130\nthen Documents.\n\n114\n00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,320\nOver here, on the left-hand side,\n\n115\n00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,130\nI have a navigation pane, that shows\nme again libraries and documents here.\n\n116\n00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,230\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\ncall it file one and\n\n117\n00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,990\nclick save and\nnow I can close out of the program.\n\n118\n00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,370\nAnd now I don't see where\nthe file actually went.\n\n119\n00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,830\nThe file can actually be found\nin several different ways.\n\n120\n00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,435\nBut one of the easiest ways to do this is,\nif I go ahead and\n\n121\n00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:47,717\nclick on the start button.\n\n122\n00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:54,103\nAnd notice because I am logged in as\nmyself, Ronnie, I can click on documents.\n\n123\n00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:59,302\nAnd I see that file1 exists right\nhere Now, even though we've\n\n124\n00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:04,780\nlaunched a program by going\ndirectly to the file location.\n\n125\n00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,020\nWe've also done it by using\ntwo different shortcuts.\n\n126\n00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,800\nWe can also up, open or\n\n127\n00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,590\nexecute a program in a different way,\ndirectly from the file itself.\n\n128\n00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,770\nIf I have the file which is file1,\nwhich I created in Word Pad.\n\n129\n00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,530\nBecause of the association that\nthis file has with Word Pad,\n\n130\n00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,870\nall I have to do is simply select it,\nand I can press Enter.\n\n131\n00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,640\nAnd that actually brings up\nanother word processing document.\n\n132\n00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,690\nLet me cancel out of that one for\nright now.\n\n133\n00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,400\nAnd so this one opened up in\nanother program called Word.\n\n134\n00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,690\nBut if I didn't want it to open up in Word\nitself, I could right-click, and select\n\n135\n00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,450\nit to Open With, and then notice I have\nan option of two of these choices here.\n\n136\n00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,430\nSo I can select Word Pad, and\nthat will open up in the original program\n\n137\n00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,900\nthat I went ahead and\ncreated this file in.\n\n138\n00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,430\nSo being able to execute a program\ncan be done in multiple ways.\n\n139\n00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,550\nDirectly from the file location itself,\nthrough shortcuts that may exist in\n\n140\n00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,200\nthe Start Menu,\na shortcut that I also created.\n\n141\n00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,050\nOr I can go directly to the file and\nthen associate that with a program and\n\n142\n00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,580\nopen up a, a program that way as well.\n\n143\n00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,340\nSo, there's many different\nways to do that.\n\n144\n00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,340\nWhen we start dealing with shortcuts and\nfiles, the majority of the time,\n\n145\n00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,800\nwe need to make sure that when we create\nshortcuts, we know where they're going.\n\n146\n00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,580\nAnd a lot of people will create shortcuts\nand put them on their desktop instead.\n\n147\n00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,690\nIf you've ever gone by someone's computer,\nand you see 50 or\n\n148\n00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,440\n60 different shortcuts on their desktop.\n\n149\n00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,970\nThat's because they find it very easy\nto work from that one desktop location.\n\n150\n00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,530\nYou can even create a direct\nshortcut to that file, and\n\n151\n00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,000\nthen have that file open up the program.\n\n152\n00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,960\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n153\n00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,749\nIf I go back to Start,\nand inside of Documents.\n\n154\n00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,486\nNow with file1,\nwhich we created inside of Word Pad,\n\n155\n00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:08,150\nI can right-click, and\nthen go down to Send To, select Desktop.\n\n156\n00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,040\nAnd now I've created another\nshortcut that links to the file.\n\n157\n00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,286\nBut because that file was\nalso created by Word Pad,\n\n158\n00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,950\nit can also link to open\nup that Word Pad as well.\n\n159\n00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,260\nSo this one actually ended up creating\nit and linking it to Word, but\n\n160\n00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,430\nlet me go down here, right-click,\nand go to Open With.\n\n161\n00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,333\nI'm gonna choose a default program for\nright now, and change that, so\n\n162\n00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,460\ninstead it opens up with Word Pad,\nand there it is.\n\n163\n00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,395\nSo the shortcut to the file?\n\n164\n00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:43,220\nAllowed me to launch not only the file,\nbut\n\n165\n00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,110\nthe application which created this file.\n\n166\n00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,700\nSo, those are the differences.\n\n167\n00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,190\nRemember that a shortcut is\njust a link to an actual file.\n\n168\n00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,770\nAnd then we have the file itself,\n\n169\n00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,390\nin which we actually do need\nto be able to differentiate.\n\n170\n00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,680\nThe file itself can be a file\nlike a data file, like file one.\n\n171\n00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,650\nIt can also of course be a program,\njust like Word Pad's a program.\n\n172\n00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,040\nSo we have both of those available to us,\n\n173\n00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,740\nwe need to be able to\ndifferentiate between the two.\n\n174\n00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,410\nApplications that run of course,\ngive us more functionality.\n\n175\n00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,750\nFiles that we tend to generate\nnormally just provide for us data.\n\n176\n00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,180\nFiles of course have extensions that\nare also associated with those files, too.\n\n177\n00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,040\nNow, if I go back into\nthat documents folder.\n\n178\n00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,340\nSo I click on Start, and\nI go back to Documents.\n\n179\n00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,990\nNotice that I do not see\nwhat's called an extension.\n\n180\n00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,728\nMost extensions normally\nare the name of the file, and\n\n181\n00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,750\nthen a dot, and\nit ends in a three letter extension.\n\n182\n00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,710\nThat three letter extension by default\nwhen you install Windows, doesn't show up.\n\n183\n00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,350\nSo if I click on Organize,\nand then I go to Folder and\n\n184\n00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,500\nSearch Options, and\nthen I click on View on the View tab.\n\n185\n00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,160\nIt is right down here,\nthat if I can actually find it.\n\n186\n00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,380\nThe without moving\nthe Advanced settings bar,\n\n187\n00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,950\nthe third up from the bottom that says,\nHide extensions for known file types.\n\n188\n00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,960\nIf I uncheck that and click OK, I can\nnow see the extension to this file type.\n\n189\n00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,100\nAnd that automatically will associate\nit with a particular program, too.\n\n190\n00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,674\nEvery single file has this,\neven if it's actually hidden, 'kay?\n\n191\n00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:36,160\nAll right so, we see a method\nof creating different files.\n\n192\n00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920\nBut that's not the only method that you\nand I can use to be able to create a file.\n\n193\n00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,120\nAnd of course, to be able to open\na file and even edit a file, as well.\n\n194\n00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,090\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n195\n00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,770\nshow some of those options too,\nin navigating around an operating system.\n\n196\n00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,770\nSo the first thing that we want to do,\nis to be able to,\n\n197\n00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,930\nfrom inside of a program, open the file.\n\n198\n00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,810\nMost programs inside of Windows\nwill give us an Open option.\n\n199\n00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,460\nSo, if I now go ahead and\nselect let me go, open Word Pad again.\n\n200\n00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,150\nI'm gonna select the shortcut, and\nI'm just double-clicking on the shortcut.\n\n201\n00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,170\nInside of every program,\nit may be hidden a little bit, but\n\n202\n00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,980\nyou may have a menu bar up at the top.\n\n203\n00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,230\nAnd one of those links may\nsay the word File on it.\n\n204\n00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,230\nAnd then underneath the word File of\ncourse, will give you multiple options.\n\n205\n00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,930\nSo I actually do see this\nkind of dark blue bar here.\n\n206\n00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,930\nIf I select it, these are some of\nthe normal things that you and\n\n207\n00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,580\nI can do with a particular file.\n\n208\n00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,820\nI can create a New file, I can Open one.\n\n209\n00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,590\nI can Save,\nI can actually rename as I save the file.\n\n210\n00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,930\nI can print one, email it, you name it,\n\n211\n00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,760\nthere's multiple options\nthat we can do right here.\n\n212\n00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,860\nThe one that I want is\nthe one that says Open.\n\n213\n00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,820\nIf I select Open, it will now\ngive me another dialogue box, and\n\n214\n00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,300\nby default,\nit dumps it into my Documents folder.\n\n215\n00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,200\nWhich is only assigned to me, and\n\n216\n00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,840\nnobody else on this computer can\nuse this particular location.\n\n217\n00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,980\nFrom there, I can select the file\nthat I want, and then click Open.\n\n218\n00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,950\nAnd it's gonna say,\ndo I wanna save changes to this one?\n\n219\n00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,510\nI don't want to save any changes.\n\n220\n00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,693\nAnd that now currently opens\nthe file that I wanted to open.\n\n221\n00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:26,967\nOnce I have it opened up,\nI of course, can edit it.\n\n222\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,550\nThen, once I've done that,\nI of course, can save it.\n\n223\n00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,880\nNow there's many different\nways to save a file as well.\n\n224\n00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,890\nI can click on this little icon, and\nnotice that in that little icon,\n\n225\n00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,470\nif I hover over it, it has something that\nfloats over it, which we call a tool tip.\n\n226\n00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,070\nIt says I can also do Ctrl and\nthe letter S, and that is also\n\n227\n00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,210\nwhat we call a hot key combination\nthat we can also do to save our files.\n\n228\n00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,180\nI'm just gonna click on the little\nFile icon and select Save.\n\n229\n00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,810\nAnd when I do so, that will now\noverwrite the original file, and\n\n230\n00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,600\nwill now add in the editing\nthat I also added in here.\n\n231\n00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,770\nSometimes, once we get everything done,\n\n232\n00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,020\nwe might need to now move that file\nfrom one location to the other.\n\n233\n00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,770\nSo let's also go ahead and do that.\n\n234\n00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,810\nSo I'm gonna close out of Word Pad, and\nwanna take a look at moving files and\n\n235\n00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,095\nthen copying them,\nas well as editing them too, 'kay?\n\n236\n00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:35,260\nSo we've just edited the file,\nnow let's go ahead and\n\n237\n00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,130\ncopy a file to a new location.\n\n238\n00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,750\nAll right, this time, we're going to\ngo to what we call the File Explorer,\n\n239\n00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,500\nthe Windows explorer here in Windows 7.\n\n240\n00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,750\nIn Windows 8.1,\nit's called the File Explorer.\n\n241\n00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,140\nIf I go ahead and\nclick on the Windows explorer.\n\n242\n00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,075\nAnd over on the left-hand side navigation\npane, I can click on Documents.\n\n243\n00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:01,916\nAnd here is the file that you and\nI are going to work with.\n\n244\n00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:06,843\nNow I went ahead and\ncreated another folder inside of that,\n\n245\n00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:10,050\nDocuments folder by going to Show Notes.\n\n246\n00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,150\nNotice I have one for IT Fundamentals,\nand also, within that,\n\n247\n00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,550\nthere's another directory\ninside of that too.\n\n248\n00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,400\nSo there's different ways that you and\n\n249\n00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,490\nI can actually navigate around\ninside of the operating system.\n\n250\n00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,960\nBut for right now,\nwe're going to just go ahead and\n\n251\n00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,320\nmove or copy the file one that we have,\ninside of one of these sub folders here.\n\n252\n00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,880\nSo, easiest way to get back out\nto that original location is to,\n\n253\n00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,340\nover here on the left hand side,\nclick on Documents, and\n\n254\n00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,820\nthat will bring you back out\nto the original location.\n\n255\n00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,890\nBut then, I have a couple of options.\n\n256\n00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,740\nIf I want to copy this file,\nI can simply right click and\n\n257\n00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,070\ngo to Copy, so\nthat's one way that I can do that.\n\n258\n00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,150\nIf I now select the Copy,\nI can now use this navigation tree\n\n259\n00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,480\nover here to take me to wherever\nI want to go, into the computer.\n\n260\n00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,866\nIf I click on desktop.\n\n261\n00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,810\nI can right click underneath and\nalso select Paste,\n\n262\n00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,500\nand that will now paste that copy\nof that file to the desktop.\n\n263\n00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,190\nFor me, I can verify it by simply\nminimizing my Windows Explorer.\n\n264\n00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,320\nAnd now you can see a copy of the file.\n\n265\n00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,670\nThis is no longer a shortcut,\n\n266\n00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,850\nbut it's actually the file that's\nbeen copied to this location.\n\n267\n00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,040\nWith the copying process,\nit takes the original and\n\n268\n00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,010\nit makes a copy of it, and\nthen it puts it to wha,\n\n269\n00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,350\nsome other location that we want to,\nthat we want it tobe.\n\n270\n00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,600\nBut it now creates two copies\nof the exact same file,\n\n271\n00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,700\nif you modify one the original\none will still be the same.\n\n272\n00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,030\nSo this can lead to confusion,\n\n273\n00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,370\nespecially if you think both of\nthe files are actually the same.\n\n274\n00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,480\nEven though you went to a new location,\nyou may end up going back to the old\n\n275\n00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,330\nlocation and wondering why your\nediting didn't take place.\n\n276\n00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,770\nSo instead, what might be another\noption is to move the file.\n\n277\n00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,720\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget rid of this file by right clicking and\n\n278\n00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,255\ngoing to Delete, so that way I\nget rid of that copy of the file.\n\n279\n00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:28,235\nI'm going to go back into\nthe Documents folder.\n\n280\n00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:32,665\nI used the Windows Explorer again,\nand into Documents.\n\n281\n00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,905\nAnd this time I'm going\nto move the file instead.\n\n282\n00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:42,218\nMoving is the pro, is the process of\ncopying the file, deleting it from\n\n283\n00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:48,050\nits original location, and\nthen allowing me to put it someplace else.\n\n284\n00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,640\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n285\n00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,760\nLet me change those icons a little bit so\n\n286\n00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,230\nwe can see them maybe\na little bit better here.\n\n287\n00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,303\nThere we go.\n\n288\n00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,360\nI need to do the file one here.\n\n289\n00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,105\nNow if I right click and\nselect instead, oops,\n\n290\n00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:08,390\noh, it doesn't have the move, all right.\n\n291\n00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,880\nSo let, good time to use a shortcut.\n\n292\n00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,630\nSo if I go ahead and select the file,\n\n293\n00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,460\nwhat I can do instead is, I can actually\ngo ahead and right click and go to Cut.\n\n294\n00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,380\nNow when I cut it,\nyou can barely see it, but\n\n295\n00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,770\nits actually turned a little\nbit more kind of grayed out.\n\n296\n00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,170\nSo now I've got a copy of that file.\n\n297\n00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,860\nNow if I go to the desktop and\nI right click and\n\n298\n00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,230\nI open the, let me see if I can do\nthis let me just go to desktop.\n\n299\n00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,990\nIf I just go to desktop,\nI can right click and paste, and\n\n300\n00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,280\nwhat I've just done is move the file from\nthe original location over here, and\n\n301\n00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,860\nI can verify that by going back to\ndocuments, and now notice that file zero,\n\n302\n00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,450\nor file one is no longer\nin its original location.\n\n303\n00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,970\nAnd now it has been moved\nover to the desktop itself.\n\n304\n00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,300\nSo we can copy a file, we can move a file,\n\n305\n00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,988\nand the way that we move\na file is by cutting it.\n\n306\n00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:14,230\nIn other words, copying it in its\nlocation, deleting the original location,\n\n307\n00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,770\nand moving it to someplace else.\n\n308\n00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,930\nSo whenever you hear the terms cuppy.\n\n309\n00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,690\nCuppy?\n\n310\n00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,510\nCopy, cut, and paste,\nthat's normally what we're referring to.\n\n311\n00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,280\nWe can do it not only for a single file,\nbut we can also do it for\n\n312\n00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,240\nmultiple files at the same time,\nif we wanted to,\n\n313\n00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,510\nthat makes it a little bit easier to,\nto manage multiple files.\n\n314\n00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,968\nSo cuppy, I'm gonna say it again,\ncopy, cut and paste are,\n\n315\n00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:42,780\nare the three that we also want to make\nsure that, that we know how to do.\n\n316\n00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,050\nNow some of the other things,\n\n317\n00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,240\nof course then, is that we want to\nbe able to delete a file as well.\n\n318\n00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,550\nAll right?\n\n319\n00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,720\nSo, when we delete a file, there's two\nthings that end up happening, right?\n\n320\n00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,540\nBy default, Windows wants to make sure\nyou really want to delete a file.\n\n321\n00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,120\nSo I'm just going to use, like, one of\nthese shortcuts to, to help us out, and\n\n322\n00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,320\nnot get rid of my original file yet.\n\n323\n00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,700\nSo I'm going to select\nthis files one shortcut.\n\n324\n00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,735\nIf I right click and select Delete, and\n\n325\n00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:17,510\nclick, before I click Yes, I want to\nmake sure that I note what's happening.\n\n326\n00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,980\nIt says; are you sure you want to move\nthis shortcut to the Recycle Bin?\n\n327\n00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,950\nNow, if I think about that, that doesn't\nsound like the actual word delete.\n\n328\n00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,560\nDelete, for you and me,\nmeans to remove it off the hard drive.\n\n329\n00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,310\nAt least, that's what,\nwhat I always think about, in my mind.\n\n330\n00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,800\nBut what it's really doing is\nactually moving it from where it was\n\n331\n00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,075\nto a different location.\n\n332\n00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:44,070\nWell, didn't we just talk about that\nas being the idea of moving a file,\n\n333\n00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,140\nwhich is cutting and\nthen pasting it in a different location?\n\n334\n00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,450\nSo when we hit delete,\nit doesn't really mean delete,\n\n335\n00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,860\nit moves it into another folder\nthat we call the Recycle Bin.\n\n336\n00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,240\nIf I select that Recycle Bin,\nI can see that I have several different,\n\n337\n00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,030\nother objects in here,\nthat I may no longer need access to.\n\n338\n00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,760\nBut instead of automatically deleting it\noff the hard drive, it's now giving me\n\n339\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,870\nthe chance to just move it out of\nthe way so I don't see it any more.\n\n340\n00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,410\nBut then maybe tomorrow, or\n\n341\n00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,460\nmaybe the following day,\nI realize I really do need that file.\n\n342\n00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,050\nSo if I have it, and it's still in\nmy Recycle Bin, it's easy enough,\n\n343\n00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,860\ninstead, for me to right click,\nand I can select Restore.\n\n344\n00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,150\nAnd when I do that, it will put\nit back in the original location.\n\n345\n00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,430\nAnd there it is, there's the shortcut\nback in its original location.\n\n346\n00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,250\nSo it gives us that ability to do so.\n\n347\n00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,240\nBut sometimes,\nif you really want to delete it,\n\n348\n00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,850\nyou really want to bypass that Recycle\nBin, you're going to have to delete it.\n\n349\n00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,080\nNow, how can we do that?\n\n350\n00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,680\nYou have to use a combination of\nkeys to do that automatically.\n\n351\n00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,520\nThe easiest one is to press\nthe Shift key on your keyboard and\n\n352\n00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,810\nthen I can right click and\nI can select Delete.\n\n353\n00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,370\nNow notice the difference that I get.\n\n354\n00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,040\nInstead of just asking me if\nI'm gonna remove it or, or\n\n355\n00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,330\nmove it over to the Recycle Bin,\nnow it's actually asking me,\n\n356\n00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,690\nam I sure I want to permanently\ndelete this shortcut?\n\n357\n00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,830\nSo what this should tell me, or what this\nshould, what should happen here is that\n\n358\n00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,540\nit's not going to move it to the Recycle\nBin, it's just going to get rid of it.\n\n359\n00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,330\nSo, let's see if that happens.\n\n360\n00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:37,840\nI click Yes,\nI have the Recycle Bin on my desktop, and\n\n361\n00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,830\nwhen I go there, I notice something.\n\n362\n00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,610\nI do not see that shortcut for\nfile one existing inside the Recycle Bin.\n\n363\n00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,441\nIf it doesn't exist inside the Recycle\nBin, I can't actually restore it either.\n\n364\n00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:54,273\nSo you do wanna be careful when you\nchoose to delete something permanently.\n\n365\n00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:58,600\nMost of the time What we do instead\nis we automatically let it sit in\n\n366\n00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,532\nthe recycle bin until we really\nrun out of hard drive space or\n\n367\n00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:08,220\nwe may even have the recycle bin clear\nit out for us after a period of time.\n\n368\n00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,550\nBut, usually that's we end up doing.\n\n369\n00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,840\nSo it's a safety mechanism so\nthat you and I,\n\n370\n00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,680\nwhen we accidentally delete something,\nsuch as I select file one.\n\n371\n00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,100\nI'm gonna go ahead and rename it, too.\n\n372\n00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,600\nSo that way, we don't get it confused\nwith the other one that's in there.\n\n373\n00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,390\nAnd if I right-click on file one,\nnotice that I can also select Rename, and\n\n374\n00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,630\nwe'll call this one Test1 instead.\n\n375\n00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,660\nSo, I may be moving very quickly, and\nI think that my desktop is too cluttered.\n\n376\n00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,120\nI go ahead and I select it, and I see that\nI've selected it and I hit the delete\n\n377\n00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,970\nkey on my keyboard and I don't think\nanything about it and I just say Yes.\n\n378\n00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,910\nWell, there it goes and now I think that\nI've actually deleted it out of there.\n\n379\n00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,290\nIf I have not actually hit the shift key\nat the same time I have hit the delete\n\n380\n00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,260\nkey, it should still be right\nhere in their cycle bin and\n\n381\n00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,735\nthen I can select Test1 and\nrestore it back to the original location.\n\n382\n00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:12,305\n[SOUND] So it really does help in being\nable to know where files end up going.\n\n383\n00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:18,320\nAlso by accident sometimes when a file\ngets renamed to something else.\n\n384\n00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,160\nI've done this many times when\nI've thought that I had a renamed\n\n385\n00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,870\na file the way that I wanted to and\nI just forgot.\n\n386\n00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,190\nAnd then I hit some unusual letter and\nI didn't think about it again.\n\n387\n00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,310\nNow, I'm trying to look for\nthe original file and I can't find it.\n\n388\n00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,580\nBeing able to rename it\nback to its original file\n\n389\n00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,690\nwill also help us in\nlocating files very easily.\n\n390\n00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,210\nSo making sure that somebody didn't\ndelete the file permanently.\n\n391\n00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,150\nBeing able to rename the file,\neven accidentally,\n\n392\n00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,554\nyou know now how to change it back.\n\n393\n00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:52,380\nBeing able to move a file.\n\n394\n00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,880\nBeing able to copy as well as move our,\nI'm gonna say it wrong,\n\n395\n00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,680\nCopy, Cut and Paste a file are all\npart of, of understanding navigation.\n\n396\n00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,090\nAnd also just taking a look at\nthe idea of deleting a file as well.\n\n397\n00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,170\nSo you and\nI have just spent a little bit of time\n\n398\n00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,080\nin just getting familiar with\nworking with just one file.\n\n399\n00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,400\nBut now being able to navigate around\nthe operating system a little bit more.\n\n400\n00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,710\nWe're right up on our break at this point\nand we've still got a lot more to go.\n\n401\n00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,760\nSo next when when we actually\ncome back we're gonna talk about\n\n402\n00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,360\nsome of the different information\nthat our files also provide for us.\n\n403\n00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,560\nSo, at this point,\nwe'll see you right after our break to\n\n404\n00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,638\ncontinue on with IP Fundamentals and\nBasic IT Literacy.\n\n405\n00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,452\n[SOUND]\n\n406\n00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:46,080\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,350\nWelcome back as we continue\non in IT Fundamentals.\n\n408\n00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,310\nWe've just taken a look\nat navigating around the,\n\n409\n00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,330\ninterface of our operating system.\n\n410\n00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,590\nBeing able to, to, I'm gonna say it right.\n\n411\n00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,850\nCopy, Cut, and Paste a file.\n\n412\n00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,020\nOf course being able to open a file,\nedit a file, we've done all that.\n\n413\n00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,140\nWe're now continuing on\nwith our objectives.\n\n414\n00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,450\nAnd our next objective\ncalls out specifically\n\n415\n00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,870\nthat we work with different\ntypes of files too.\n\n416\n00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,700\nAnd what we're mentioning here is\nwhat we call read-only files versus,\n\n417\n00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,260\nof course, the modifiable type of file.\n\n418\n00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,990\nNow you may not have encountered\nthis before that you know about but\n\n419\n00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,677\nyou've probably done it and\njust didn't realize it.\n\n420\n00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:28,410\nAll right.\n\n421\n00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,400\nSo what is a Read Only file?\n\n422\n00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,180\nA Read Only file is a type of file\nof course that we can open up,\n\n423\n00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,200\nwe can look at it, you and I may even be\nable to manipulate some of the data and\n\n424\n00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,140\nthe text in it.\n\n425\n00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,380\nBut then when we go to try and\nclose it out and\n\n426\n00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,040\nsave it, it's not gonna allow\nus to save the changes.\n\n427\n00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,460\nModifiable files are pretty\nmuch the same away.\n\n428\n00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,060\nWe can open a file, but\nthen once we open it, we can edit it.\n\n429\n00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,000\nAnd then when we go and try and close out\na file, it's gonna ask us if we want to\n\n430\n00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,750\nsave it and when we save it,\nit will accept those changes.\n\n431\n00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,310\nThose are pretty much the two that\nwe wanna deal with right away.\n\n432\n00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,140\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n433\n00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,140\nIf I go back into my Documents folder.\n\n434\n00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,050\nSo I clicked on the Start button.\n\n435\n00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,730\nAnd then I navigated up here\nto where it days Documents.\n\n436\n00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,400\nAnd inside of Show Notes,\nI went ahead and created a,\n\n437\n00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,340\na Read-only file as well\nas a Modifiable file, too.\n\n438\n00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,280\nSo I'm gonna go inside Show Notes.\n\n439\n00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,410\nAnd inside of the Show Notes folder,\n\n440\n00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,740\nthere is another folder that's\ncalled IT Fundamentals.\n\n441\n00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,980\nAnd of course inside of IT Fundemtentals\nthere's another folder called files and\n\n442\n00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,490\nit is in sub folder 01.\n\n443\n00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,570\nWe tried to make it as\ngeneric as we could.\n\n444\n00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,890\nAnd I have two different files\nthat are available to me.\n\n445\n00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,429\nOne says Future_products and\n\n446\n00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:58,220\nthe other one here says\nFootprints_sports_holiday_schedules.\n\n447\n00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,780\nJust a generic file that\nI actually just grabbed.\n\n448\n00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,320\nSo that we could make this demonstration.\n\n449\n00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,930\nSo if I open up\nthe Future_products text file,\n\n450\n00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,520\nthat will open up this file in a little\ntext editor that we call Notepad.\n\n451\n00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,390\nAnd not that you really need to\nsee all the information in it,\n\n452\n00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,060\nbut we'll make sure that you can\nsee some of the information in it.\n\n453\n00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,880\nHere is a list of future\npossible products that I have.\n\n454\n00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,080\nSo notice that I had accidentally,\nyou know, went ahead and\n\n455\n00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,360\ntyped in the letter C at some point and\ndidn't realize it.\n\n456\n00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,060\nWhat if I was looking at this and\nI realized something,\n\n457\n00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:40,086\nthat I wanted to also end up in\nthe future product for this one.\n\n458\n00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:45,576\nKayaks, Cleats, GPS,\nHelmets I wanted to add in\n\n459\n00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,856\ngas or yeah, Gas Lanterns.\n\n460\n00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,800\nTo, to also provide for\nsome type of sporting goods needs too.\n\n461\n00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,580\nSo I thought about it and I said this is\nactually part of the future products.\n\n462\n00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,640\nAnd I don't think about it and\nI go ahead and I click on the red X.\n\n463\n00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,160\nAnd now notice it says do you want\nme to save changes to the file?\n\n464\n00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,230\nI can click Save and when I do so,\nI may go ahead and just click Save again.\n\n465\n00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,470\nAnd now it says hey are your\nsure do you want to replace it?\n\n466\n00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,310\nI'm gonna say Yes.\n\n467\n00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,800\nAnd now it tells me that this\nfile is set to read only.\n\n468\n00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,980\nSo it is telling me that I do not have\nthe ability to save changes file.\n\n469\n00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,840\nNotice that I've modified the file.\n\n470\n00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,120\nAll right?\n\n471\n00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,450\nI've added in Gas Lanterns, I\naccidentally typed in this letter C here.\n\n472\n00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,190\nBut I cannot go ahead and\nactually make changes that way.\n\n473\n00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:47,450\nI'm going to go ahead and close this out\nand don't save the changes right now.\n\n474\n00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,102\nIf I go into\nthe Footprint_sports_holiday_schedule,\n\n475\n00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:56,710\nthat's gonna bring it up in this,\nspreadsheet file.\n\n476\n00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,560\nAnd I can go ahead and\nadd in Wednesday the 1st\n\n477\n00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,880\nof January and New Years Day again.\n\n478\n00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,700\nAs another part of the year\nas it comes back around.\n\n479\n00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,910\nThis time if I go to File and\n\n480\n00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,980\nI select Save,\nnotice this says read only again.\n\n481\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,430\nSo now, it gives me this option, though,\n\n482\n00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:28,770\nto save a copy instead\nas a different file.\n\n483\n00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,460\nSo that's the only way\nI can get around that.\n\n484\n00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,920\nNow I didn't get around it by\noverwriting the original file.\n\n485\n00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,810\nNotice that it gave me the option\nhere instead to just make a copy.\n\n486\n00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,350\nIf I want to modify that file.\n\n487\n00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,985\nLet me go back to the use\nyour products one.\n\n488\n00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,430\nI can right-click, and\ngo to properties, and\n\n489\n00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:51,869\nthen simply remove this attribute that\nsays read only, and I can click OK.\n\n490\n00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,827\nThat's really all that there is\na difference between the modifiable and\n\n491\n00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,702\nthe read-only file here.\n\n492\n00:31:58,702 --> 00:32:03,620\nThis time, if I open up that file\nby simply double clicking on it.\n\n493\n00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:08,600\nAnd remember that,\nthat file is linked to well, here Notepad.\n\n494\n00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,770\nSo by opening the file itself,\nit also opened the application.\n\n495\n00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,160\nThat, it's attached to.\n\n496\n00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,450\nNow I can type in gas lanterns.\n\n497\n00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,090\nAnd then, when I do a file save,\nit doesn't complain.\n\n498\n00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480\nI now am able to have a modified file.\n\n499\n00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,597\nSometimes if somebody believes\nthat they're opening up a, a,\n\n500\n00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:37,920\na modifiable file but it's not.\n\n501\n00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,740\nYou may want to check the attributes\nof that file to see what's happening,\n\n502\n00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,200\nso that way you know\nwhy they can't save it.\n\n503\n00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,730\nNow should they actually\nbe writing over it?\n\n504\n00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,630\nMore than likely it's checked as read\nonly, so that people don't modify it.\n\n505\n00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,970\nSo before you go in and change that,\n\n506\n00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,312\nyou make want to make sure that somebody's\nsupposed to be able to write to that file.\n\n507\n00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,620\nAll right.\n\n508\n00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,960\nNow our next objective that's also\ncalled out in basic IT literacy\n\n509\n00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,749\nis to be able to navigate\na file structure.\n\n510\n00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,670\nIn Windows,\nwe're given what we call file explorer.\n\n511\n00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,540\nFile explorer is\na graphical user interface.\n\n512\n00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,310\nAn easy way for me to point and click and\n\n513\n00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,060\nto be able to navigate around the hard\ndrive on the computer itself.\n\n514\n00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,206\nSo over here on the left hand side,\nthis is our navigation pane.\n\n515\n00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:32,990\nAnd on the right hand side\nare the details of what we're looking at.\n\n516\n00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,130\nIf I click on local disk C\n\n517\n00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,580\nwith my mouse, I can now see that with,\ninside the local disk C.\n\n518\n00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,950\nI have perf perf logs.\n\n519\n00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,350\nProgram Files.\n\n520\n00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,318\nProgram Files (x86).\n\n521\n00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,400\nThe users folder.\n\n522\n00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200\nAnd of course, Windows itself.\n\n523\n00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,120\nIf I go ahead and access users,\nby selecting it and then pressing enter.\n\n524\n00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,400\nI can now see there's more\nsubfolders inside of it.\n\n525\n00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,390\nAnd then I can also go ahead and\nclick on my name.\n\n526\n00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,770\nAnd now I can see all of the files\nthat are associated with me.\n\n527\n00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,620\nOr folders that are also\nassociated with me.\n\n528\n00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,494\nAnd also the files if I go\ninside of my documents,\n\n529\n00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:25,190\nI can see my show notes,\nand IT Fundamentals.\n\n530\n00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,610\nAs well as the files and\nthis one file that I have also out here.\n\n531\n00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,610\nIn that sub folder.\n\n532\n00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,530\nNavigating around Windows Explorer is\nreally as simple as pointing and clicking.\n\n533\n00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,050\nBut it makes it even easier\nthan that a lot of times.\n\n534\n00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,480\nWhat if I wanted to back out a couple\nof different levels instead?\n\n535\n00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,790\nI don't want to be inside\nof IP Fundamentals but\n\n536\n00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,010\nI want to be inside\nthe my documents folder.\n\n537\n00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,260\nWell, there's a couple of different\nways that we can do that.\n\n538\n00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,133\nI could start all over,\nby going back to local disk c.\n\n539\n00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:02,707\nBut the way that the Windows Explorer's\nactually designed\n\n540\n00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:05,930\ngives me the ability instead to back out.\n\n541\n00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,230\nNotice in the upper left hand corner I\nhave these two navigation buttons here.\n\n542\n00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,190\nOne is to go forward and\nthe other one is to back out, now,\n\n543\n00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,130\nthe reason why the forward one is not\nthere is because I haven't gone any\n\n544\n00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,010\nfurther than I have at this point.\n\n545\n00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:24,040\nIf I now select files,\nnotice that I'm still not moving forward.\n\n546\n00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,730\nBut if I click on this back arrow,\n\n547\n00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,640\nnow notice that the forward button now\nhighlights, which means it's active.\n\n548\n00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,270\nAnd it allows me then to\nbe able to navigate up and\n\n549\n00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,990\ndown what we call the file structure.\n\n550\n00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,640\nOr sometimes you call it the tree.\n\n551\n00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,850\nSo, I can back out and then I can use this\nbar at the top to show me where I am.\n\n552\n00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,920\nSo, currently, I am looking at\nthe IT fundamentals folder,\n\n553\n00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,200\nbecause I am within the show notes folder,\nwhich is its parent folder.\n\n554\n00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,860\nAnd if I back out again, I can now see,\nhere is my documents folder right here.\n\n555\n00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,880\nSo, it is from my My Documents folder\nthat I can see that I have Show Notes.\n\n556\n00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,420\nAnd, within here I can go ahead and begin\nto create more files if I need to or,\n\n557\n00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,320\nto delete files, move files, copy files,\njust like we talked about earlier.\n\n558\n00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,390\nSo, the ability to navigate around is\none of the ways that we can do this.\n\n559\n00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,650\nFor those of you going on towards your A+\nstudies, not only can you do it this way,\n\n560\n00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,210\nyou'll also be able to do it by typing,\nusing the command line interface.\n\n561\n00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:38,970\nAnd you'll learn how to navigate through\nthe same structure that we just did.\n\n562\n00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,470\nEverything that we can do in\nthis interface here, you and\n\n563\n00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,640\nI can also do by using what we\ncall the command line interface.\n\n564\n00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,300\nEssentially typing all the commands\n\n565\n00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,750\nto make us navigate around the hard\ndrive in the way that we just did it.\n\n566\n00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,950\nOkay.\n\n567\n00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,100\nSo those are some of the different\nways that we can navigate around.\n\n568\n00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,800\nUsing that,\nthe Windows Explorer is by far,\n\n569\n00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,710\nthe easiest way to get\naccess to everything.\n\n570\n00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,480\nIf you are only really limited,\nthough, to your own files and folders.\n\n571\n00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,570\nThe only place that you and\n\n572\n00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,710\nI would normally need to go is\nright here on the start button.\n\n573\n00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,050\nAll of the folders and the files\nassociated with your account, your and\n\n574\n00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,510\nmy account, so here it is.\n\n575\n00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,700\nHere's Ronny, and notice here's my\nMy Documents folder, my pictures.\n\n576\n00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,640\nMy music, those are usually\nthe ones that I'm associated with.\n\n577\n00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,200\nBut if I thought I had more\nI can click on my own name.\n\n578\n00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,260\nAnd now I can see all of the sub folders\nthat are associated with just me.\n\n579\n00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,490\nAnd so if I had any pictures, by default\nthey would save under my pictures.\n\n580\n00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,700\nIf I had music they would save right here.\n\n581\n00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,370\nDocuments, Favorites,\nDownloads, you name it.\n\n582\n00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,970\nThey're all only associated with me.\n\n583\n00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,060\nSo I don't really have\nto go any place else.\n\n584\n00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,320\nI can simply do my navigation right here.\n\n585\n00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,820\nOkay.\n\n586\n00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,810\nAll right.\n\n587\n00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,710\nSo now that we have a good idea of\nhow to move around the desktop.\n\n588\n00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,230\nHow to create a simple file.\n\n589\n00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,930\nAnd of course edit and\nmanipulate that file.\n\n590\n00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,050\nWe now want to go ahead and\n\n591\n00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,950\ntake a look at being able to display\nfiles a little bit differently.\n\n592\n00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,810\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n593\n00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,540\nI'm gonna go inside of My Documents.\n\n594\n00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,600\nAnd show notes again and IT Fundamentals.\n\n595\n00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,090\nAnd of course, Files and\nyou're probably like are you joking?\n\n596\n00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,630\nDid you do this?\n\n597\n00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,650\nYes, I did this on purpose so that we\ncould actually use some of the navigation.\n\n598\n00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:37,110\nAnd inside that, I'm gonna go to\nsub folder one, and now, you and\n\n599\n00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,780\nI can actually see that there's\nmultiple files in here.\n\n600\n00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,690\nNow, the files are normally\ndisplayed in alphabetical order.\n\n601\n00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,910\nSo, if you take a look at it,\nall the folders normally come first.\n\n602\n00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,730\nAnd then individual files\nare then displayed, and\n\n603\n00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,470\nnotice, employee, sales and supplemental.\n\n604\n00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,200\nSo that is its natural\ndisplay order by default.\n\n605\n00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,430\nBut you and I can change that.\n\n606\n00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,320\nThe way that you and I can change this\nis by sorting the files themselves.\n\n607\n00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,860\nNow when we talk about sorting,\nI can actually sort from ascending to\n\n608\n00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:16,200\ndescending, a to z, or\ndescending to ascending z to a.\n\n609\n00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,980\nAlso, ascending would be\nzero through nine, and\n\n610\n00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,780\ndescending would also\nbe nine through zero.\n\n611\n00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:27,390\nThe easiest way to do this is that right\nabove the names that you see here for\n\n612\n00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,610\nthe files.\n\n613\n00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,620\nIf you hover over where it says name,\n\n614\n00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,380\nnotice that the color\nchanges just a little bit.\n\n615\n00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,716\nOver on the right hand side\nthere's a little drop down arrow.\n\n616\n00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:40,750\nAnd I can go ahead and\ntell it how I want to go ahead and\n\n617\n00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,290\nsort this out if I want to, and\nactually this is a filter over here.\n\n618\n00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,699\nThe sorting is right up here\nwhere you see this little mark.\n\n619\n00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,643\nThe sorting right here tells me its the\nlittle up arrow that's actually pointing\n\n620\n00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:52,751\nin a little triangle.\n\n621\n00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:56,479\nIf I select it where it's pointing up,\nit's gonna do it in ascending order.\n\n622\n00:39:56,479 --> 00:40:03,190\nIf I click on it again, notice how it\nactually sorts it in descending order.\n\n623\n00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,530\nNow, just when you think, wow,\n\n624\n00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,490\nthat's pretty cool, that's not the only\nway that we can sort these files.\n\n625\n00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,080\nI can also do it by the date modified.\n\n626\n00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,270\nThe date actually tells me when\nthese files were created, and\n\n627\n00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:22,430\nnow I can see that little down arrow,\npointing down, that will then show me\n\n628\n00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:28,810\nthe most recent date to the earliest\ndate that I have in, here too.\n\n629\n00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,700\nIf I go ahead and click on it one time,\nit now sorts it ascending\n\n630\n00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,530\nfrom the earliest date to\nthe latest date that I have.\n\n631\n00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,050\nNotice that we can do it\nby file types as well.\n\n632\n00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,400\nFile types, that allows me to group\nall the files together by their type.\n\n633\n00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,450\nSo let's say that, for example, I have\nmultiple text files, but I wanna be able\n\n634\n00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:53,600\nto select all of them at one time,\nbut because I've named them kind of\n\n635\n00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,550\nwith different letters, they're scattered\nthroughout my entire My Documents folder.\n\n636\n00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,930\nIt's not easy for me to do so.\n\n637\n00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,730\nSo instead, I can come here and\nselect Type and\n\n638\n00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:09,530\nthat way notice that all these Microsoft\nExcel files are now all grouped together?\n\n639\n00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,970\nThen, I can select these,\nI can go ahead and click on the first one.\n\n640\n00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,840\nI can hold my Shift key down Select\nthe second and the third one, and now,\n\n641\n00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,470\nfrom there,\nI can copy all these files if I want to.\n\n642\n00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,920\nI can cut them and\nmove them to a different location.\n\n643\n00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,050\nI can even delete all of these files\nall at one time if I choose to do so.\n\n644\n00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,670\nThe last option, of course,\nis we can also do it by size.\n\n645\n00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,060\nSo it may be that you're looking for\n\n646\n00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,110\nfiles that are really large, that you may\nwant to move off to a different drive.\n\n647\n00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,530\nSo this way you can go ahead and\nsort them.\n\n648\n00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:51,030\nAgain, by descending order if you want to,\nor of course, by ascending order too.\n\n649\n00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,120\nSo it just depends on what you need\nwhen you talk about the idea of sorting.\n\n650\n00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,580\nIf we wanted to, and\nwe wanted to say, hey look,\n\n651\n00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,910\nI want to make sure that I display all of\nthese in another way, by using filters.\n\n652\n00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,720\nWe already just showed you\na little bit about the filters.\n\n653\n00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,360\nBy name, I can select just to show the\nfiles that actually begin with A through\n\n654\n00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,360\nH, or I can do it for a Q through Z Z.\n\n655\n00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,430\nAnd now notice, I'm missing the one\nthat begins with Employees.\n\n656\n00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,410\nSo, so that way,\nI can hide some of them, and\n\n657\n00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,500\nonly deal with the files that I\nwant to be able to deal with.\n\n658\n00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,240\nAnd of course, under Date modified,\n\n659\n00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,380\nnotice that we can also add\nin some other categories too.\n\n660\n00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,550\nExcuse me,\nlet me see if I can select it correctly.\n\n661\n00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,350\nAnd I can even select a date range here.\n\n662\n00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:45,560\nSo this way, I can limit my search to\na specific date if I wanted to, and\n\n663\n00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,300\nthat way be able to choose those.\n\n664\n00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,238\nAnd of course the same thing with files,\nfile folders,\n\n665\n00:42:50,238 --> 00:42:51,700\nor just the Excel worksheets.\n\n666\n00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,690\nAnd then Size tells us Small and\nthen to other sizes too.\n\n667\n00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,270\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that we can do that.\n\n668\n00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,280\nSo by being able to display it in the way\nthat we need to, it helps us to be able to\n\n669\n00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,930\neasily go ahead and\npinpoint exactly what we're looking for.\n\n670\n00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,310\nAnd like we said a little bit earlier,\nthen you can copy it, you can\n\n671\n00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,250\ncut it if you want to, you can delete\nthem, you can move them, you name it,\n\n672\n00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,680\nit's up to you after you actually do\ndisplay them in the correct order and\n\n673\n00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,240\nbe able to select them the way\nthat you want to, all right?\n\n674\n00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,660\nSo those are some of the options\nwe have available to us.\n\n675\n00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,040\nSo, so far we've also talked about\nread only and, modifiable files.\n\n676\n00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,970\nWe went ahead and we've showed you some of\nthe different ways that you can navigate\n\n677\n00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,240\nthrough the file structure itself\nby using Windows Explorer.\n\n678\n00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,990\nAnd now, we've also done the sorting and\ndisplay.\n\n679\n00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:56,210\nThe last option that it has for\nyou and me here, in this,\n\n680\n00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,468\nobjective, is the ability to use a search.\n\n681\n00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:03,610\nNow in the upper right hand\ncorner of our file explorer,\n\n682\n00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,140\nnotice that I have a search\nin sub folder one.\n\n683\n00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,860\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and\nsearch in sub folder one,\n\n684\n00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,490\nI'm gonna just type in employee and see.\n\n685\n00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,015\nAnd you can see that right\nhere in sub folder one,\n\n686\n00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:23,590\nit's actually finding everything\nthat is possible to find on the,\n\n687\n00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,868\nyeah, in sub folder one,\nsub folder one, sub folder one,\n\n688\n00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:31,010\nsub folder one, just wanted to make sure\nI was actually finding the right data.\n\n689\n00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,970\nAnything that begins with the word\nemployee is now also showing up.\n\n690\n00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,770\nAnd also, apparently, there's employee\nwithin this own, this file itself.\n\n691\n00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,490\nIt gives us the ability\nto be able to search for\n\n692\n00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:49,400\nall that, whether it's within the the\nfile, or if it's in the file name too.\n\n693\n00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,020\nSo if I use this bar up here at the top,\nand I click on Show Notes instead,\n\n694\n00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,770\nI can now look for,\nlet's look for employee again.\n\n695\n00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,580\nAnd now,\n\n696\n00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:07,870\nI can see that there are different files\nwith the word employees on, on it.\n\n697\n00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,720\nSo here is the name in\nwhich I see employee, and\n\n698\n00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,140\nthis one is in subfolder four,\nthe next one is in subfolder one,\n\n699\n00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,120\nsubfolder two,\nanother one within the subfolder two and\n\n700\n00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,450\nsolutions, subfolder one,\nsubfolder five, down here.\n\n701\n00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,420\nWhen you see it and\nyou don't see it actually highlighted,\n\n702\n00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,650\nit means it found it somewhere\nwithin the data on that file.\n\n703\n00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,220\nAnd you see another one here, and\nanother one here, and another one here.\n\n704\n00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,510\nSo all that information is\nactually contained within,\n\n705\n00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,100\ngiving you the ability to search for\na file very quickly.\n\n706\n00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:45,710\nNow, finding files is really good,\nbecause your computer's gonna\n\n707\n00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,790\nfill up with a ton of them the more\nthat you use that computer.\n\n708\n00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:55,360\nBut where I like using the search function\nis when I click on the start button,\n\n709\n00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,150\nand it's right here where it says,\nSearch programs and files.\n\n710\n00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,670\nWith the Search programs and\nfiles, the reason why I like it\n\n711\n00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,300\nis because it's not only looking for\nthe data or the programs and\n\n712\n00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,530\nfiles that I'm looking for, but it also\ngives me a chance to run them right away.\n\n713\n00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,710\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n714\n00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,910\nIf I wanted to launch the calculator, the\nnormal way that I showed you a little bit\n\n715\n00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,670\nearlier, we would have gone to\nthe Start button, to the All Programs,\n\n716\n00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,775\nI know it was up in my\nshortcut list right here.\n\n717\n00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:31,040\nBut I can go to All Programs\n> Accessories, and\n\n718\n00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,920\nhere's the calculator right here,\nhere's the shortcut for the calculator.\n\n719\n00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,810\nThe other way I can do it is by\nsimply clicking on Start and\n\n720\n00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,040\nthen Search programs and files.\n\n721\n00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,970\nI can begin to type in calculator,\nand now it shows up automatically.\n\n722\n00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,700\nAnd I can see, here are the programs\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n723\n00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,820\nAnd even within the Control Panel,\nit's also seeing something else\n\n724\n00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,590\nthat may help me in the term\nthat has C-A-L-C in it.\n\n725\n00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,400\nSo just by doing a simple search,\nI can now select calculator, and\n\n726\n00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,210\nit's up and it's ready to go.\n\n727\n00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,230\nSo we use our example again.\n\n728\n00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,260\nI'm gonna type in employee.\n\n729\n00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,550\nNotice I can still do the same search\noption but without actually being\n\n730\n00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,690\nspecific to that one subfolder that\nwe were in a little bit earlier, or\n\n731\n00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,850\neven inside of My Documents.\n\n732\n00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,720\nNow it went throughout\nthe entire hard drive, and\n\n733\n00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,800\nit found all of the files here that have,\npossibly, the word employee in it too.\n\n734\n00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,210\nSo the search options that are available\nin Windows today, is really great.\n\n735\n00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,194\nAll right?\n\n736\n00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:42,205\nSo for the second set here,\n\n737\n00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:46,591\nwe've talked about modifiable files and\nread only files.\n\n738\n00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:50,005\nWe've navigated the file structure,\nwe've now sorted.\n\n739\n00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:53,447\nWe've now also displayed\nthe files that we need to and\n\n740\n00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:56,850\nwe now also did a little bit of a search.\n\n741\n00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,037\nOur next option is a very neat option\nthat can help us a lot when we want\n\n742\n00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:05,006\nto ensure that somebody knows\nexactly what we're talking about\n\n743\n00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:07,963\nwhen something's happening\non our computer.\n\n744\n00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:10,820\nWhich is to actually do what\nwe call a screen capture.\n\n745\n00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,660\nTo do a screen capture is\nfairly easy to do, but\n\n746\n00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,630\nit's something that you do need to at,\nat least know how to do it right.\n\n747\n00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,815\nSo, if something had went wrong on the\ncomputer and I can't force anything to,\n\n748\n00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:25,701\nto go incredibly wrong here.\n\n749\n00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:29,861\nBut let's say that I wanted to\ndisplay some network settings,\n\n750\n00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:34,350\nbecause I wasn't exactly sure if\nyou knew what I was talking about.\n\n751\n00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,260\nI can go ahead and\ngo to my Network and Sharing Center.\n\n752\n00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,023\nSo, I went to Control Panel, and inside\nof Control Panel, I went to Network and\n\n753\n00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:45,002\nInternet, Network and Sharing Center.\n\n754\n00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:48,143\nAnd I'm selecting\nthe Local Area Connection, and\n\n755\n00:48:48,143 --> 00:48:50,343\nI'm gonna click on these details.\n\n756\n00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:57,120\nSo, if for one reason or another,\nyou had me look for my MAC address,\n\n757\n00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,492\nbut I didn't know how to tell you and\nI couldn't figure out how to type it out,\n\n758\n00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:03,360\nI can instead do a screenshot.\n\n759\n00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,120\nWe should all be able to, to type it out.\n\n760\n00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,010\nBut if we can't, we should be able\nto do what we call a screenshot.\n\n761\n00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,550\nNow, by doing the screenshot, most\nkeyboards attached to a Windows computer\n\n762\n00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,360\nis gonna have a Windows key on it.\n\n763\n00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,570\nThe Windows key normally resides in\nbetween the control key and the alt key.\n\n764\n00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,967\nThe other key that you're also looking for\n\n765\n00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,125\nis the one that's listed\nas print screen or PrtScr.\n\n766\n00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,100\nSo, if I go ahead and\nhold my Windows key down.\n\n767\n00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:37,728\nAnd I also try and do the print screen,\nthat should have done it.\n\n768\n00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:40,625\nIf everything is actually correct,\n\n769\n00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:45,210\nif I actually hit the right\ncombination on my computer.\n\n770\n00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:48,237\nSometimes, on laptops you never know\nif everything's actually gonna work and\n\n771\n00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:51,230\nbeing on a virtual machine, I don't\nknow if it's actually gonna work or not.\n\n772\n00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:51,730\nWe'll see.\n\n773\n00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,980\nWhat I now have is this print screen.\n\n774\n00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,280\nNow, all that stuff is now saved\nin the RAM on my computer.\n\n775\n00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,720\nI now need to go to open\nup a program called Paint.\n\n776\n00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,807\nSo, I click on the Start button.\n\n777\n00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:14,655\nI type in Paint and then, I click paste.\n\n778\n00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,351\nAnd there we go.\n\n779\n00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:21,515\nNow, I can take this simple image and\nI can email it or\n\n780\n00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:26,190\nI can now include it into\na document that I'm gonna create.\n\n781\n00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,042\nSo that,\nyou know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n782\n00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:32,297\nIf I can now let's see,\n\n783\n00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:37,609\nI can use a brush maybe,\nand change the color.\n\n784\n00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:44,550\nMake a and highlight it for you.\n\n785\n00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,830\nI know that's terrible, isn't it?\n\n786\n00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,350\nOkay.\n\n787\n00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,730\nSo you, you can do that.\n\n788\n00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,160\nNow, here's one way to do a print screen,\nand\n\n789\n00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,638\nthat's the way that you\nreally want to know.\n\n790\n00:50:52,638 --> 00:50:56,350\nIf you wanna make sure that people\ncan see exactly what you're seeing,\n\n791\n00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,730\na print screen is pretty\nmuch the way to go,\n\n792\n00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,720\nbecause it really does show\nthe entire desktop when we do this.\n\n793\n00:51:04,055 --> 00:51:05,340\nNow, let me see if I can\nget out of this thing.\n\n794\n00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,366\nNope.\n\n795\n00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,571\nThere we go.\n\n796\n00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:14,138\nSo, then, I can scroll down and\n\n797\n00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:18,160\nyou can see the entire window screen\nis right there and everything is ready.\n\n798\n00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,630\nNow, as much as that's good,\nthere's another nice\n\n799\n00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:28,450\nlittle utility built into Windows for\nus that can do just about the same thing.\n\n800\n00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,430\nBut much more selective.\n\n801\n00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,250\nSo, let me go back and\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n802\n00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,960\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthe Start button and\n\n803\n00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,610\ngo to Network and Internet,\nNetwork and Sharing Center.\n\n804\n00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,110\nAnd the Local Area Connection\nover on the right hand side.\n\n805\n00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,550\nWith the Local Area Connection\nstatus dialog box,\n\n806\n00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,710\nI'm gonna select details, and here it is.\n\n807\n00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,061\nThis exact same thing that we\nwere doing a little bit earlier.\n\n808\n00:51:53,407 --> 00:52:00,280\nBuilt into Windows 7 is actually\nsomething that we call the snipping tool.\n\n809\n00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,540\nI just typed in snip and\nyou can see that it's actually up here.\n\n810\n00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,710\nAnd now, if I select it, notice that\nthe entire screen grays out for me.\n\n811\n00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,301\nAnd instead, if I wanted to\nfocus in on just that one area,\n\n812\n00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:20,097\nI can go ahead and click and\ndraw with the crosshair,\n\n813\n00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:24,675\nand now that creates a nice\nlittle capture instead\n\n814\n00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:28,603\nfocusing in on just\nwhat I was asked about.\n\n815\n00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,280\nAnd this time,\nI have a true highlighter instead.\n\n816\n00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,830\nAnd I can highlight it and\nthat makes it a lot easier for you.\n\n817\n00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,720\nTo be able to now take this and\n\n818\n00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,170\nit automatically can say,\nI can send this snip if I want to.\n\n819\n00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,580\nAnd it's ready to go.\n\n820\n00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,700\nSo, I can save it.\n\n821\n00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,732\nAnd when I save it, notice it's gonna\nsave it underneath my pictures and\n\n822\n00:52:51,732 --> 00:52:53,725\nI can talk about network settings.\n\n823\n00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:03,850\nAnd that way,\nI'll have it available for me.\n\n824\n00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,400\nNow, David asked, is there a name for\na link like that?\n\n825\n00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,280\nI don't know if there actually is or not.\n\n826\n00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,700\nThis is just known as the snipping\ntool inside of Windows 7.\n\n827\n00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,703\nIt also appears inside of Windows 8, too.\n\n828\n00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:22,880\nI'm not gonna worry about saving that one.\n\n829\n00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,740\nYes, Shift+PrtScr is the other one,\nand then, editing in Paint.\n\n830\n00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:33,140\nToday the, the newer method is using\nthe Windows and the print screen.\n\n831\n00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,990\nIt will do the same thing.\n\n832\n00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,650\nSo, you may have some shortcuts\nwhich you learned about from\n\n833\n00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,480\nearlier versions of Windows.\n\n834\n00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,274\nI believe that they'll\nstill end up working.\n\n835\n00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:44,761\nBut in Windows 7 the Windows key and\nthe print screen is,\n\n836\n00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:47,990\nis pretty much the combination\nthat you'll need.\n\n837\n00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,652\nOn laptops, you may also have to use\nthat Fn key to make everything work too.\n\n838\n00:53:52,652 --> 00:53:53,970\nOkay?\n\n839\n00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,890\nAll right.\nNow, there's a little bit for for\n\n840\n00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,410\nus to go, but I just realized\nI've been talking way too long,\n\n841\n00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,470\nwhich means it's now time for a break.\n\n842\n00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,831\nSo, right after the break, we're gonna\ncome back, we're gonna take a look at\n\n843\n00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:07,352\nfinishing up our navigating\nthrough an operating system.\n\n844\n00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:10,222\nAnd we've got a little\nbit more to go where\n\n845\n00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:14,490\nwe're talking about now using\nsome different shortcut keys.\n\n846\n00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,843\nSo, stay tuned for that.\n\n847\n00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:22,925\n[MUSIC].\n\n848\n00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:23,460\nAll right.\n\n849\n00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,352\nWelcome back into our last segment here.\n\n850\n00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:29,610\nI wanna take a look at navigating\nthrough an operating system.\n\n851\n00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,170\nWe've got just a few\nmore concepts to cover.\n\n852\n00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,900\nIn our last segment, we went ahead and we\ntalked about doing some screen captures.\n\n853\n00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:41,620\nWe showed how to navigate around using\nthe Windows Explorer itself, and of course\n\n854\n00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,760\nwe also did, not only the screenshots,\nbut we always showed the snipping tool.\n\n855\n00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,561\nSo, our last little section here\ncovers just really three different\n\n856\n00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:53,500\nconcepts that we wanna make sure\nthat we can, can find and follow.\n\n857\n00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,497\nFirst, we're gonna take a look at some\nof the data that also is associated with\n\n858\n00:54:57,497 --> 00:54:58,960\nfiles themselves.\n\n859\n00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,567\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n860\n00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,030\nSo, I'm gonna go back\ninto my documents folder.\n\n861\n00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,940\nSo, I just clicked on the start button.\n\n862\n00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,700\nOver on the right hand column,\nI'm selecting documents and\n\n863\n00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,390\ninside of documents, show notes.\n\n864\n00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:15,110\nAnd then, inside of IT fundamentals,\n\n865\n00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:20,420\nwe'll actually go ahead and go ahead and,\nand get inside of IT fundamentals.\n\n866\n00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,320\nSo, every file has, of course,\ndata that's associated with it and\n\n867\n00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,740\nwe can call it metadata if, if we want to.\n\n868\n00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,001\nIf I right click on that file,\nthat FileZilla,\n\n869\n00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:33,740\na file that's unexecutable,\nI can go ahead and select properties.\n\n870\n00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,330\nAnd inside of properties,\n\n871\n00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,470\nwhat I'm looking for is right here\nwhere we talk about file sizes.\n\n872\n00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,994\nAnd notice that we can see the actual\nfile size listed right here.\n\n873\n00:55:42,994 --> 00:55:47,170\nNot only, of course,\nby this summary of the 5.84 megabytes but\n\n874\n00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:51,638\nof course, it even lists out the number\nof actual bytes it actually, and\n\n875\n00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:54,810\nthat's that the size is\nactually is by bytes.\n\n876\n00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,752\nHere.\n\n877\n00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,574\nSo we can see that.\n\n878\n00:55:57,574 --> 00:56:02,422\nSometimes, because we are also,\nnot only moving a single file,\n\n879\n00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:04,281\nbut multiple files too.\n\n880\n00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:09,000\nWe may have to determine the size of\nthe entire contents of what we need.\n\n881\n00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,260\nSo, I can also right click on a folder,\ngo down to properties.\n\n882\n00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,770\nAnd I can see that everything\nwithin that folder called files,\n\n883\n00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,740\nequals up to just about\ntwo megabytes itself.\n\n884\n00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,530\nRight here where it says file size and\nsize on disk.\n\n885\n00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,960\nSo it gives us the ability of course to\nbe able to find these sizes very easily.\n\n886\n00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,400\nNow today when hard drive\nspace is not at a premium.\n\n887\n00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,970\nMost of us are probably not going to\nworry about file size too much, but\n\n888\n00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:44,790\nif you are sending files,\nsuch as through email.\n\n889\n00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,930\nAnd we've already heard from Don in\nanother episode, we should never do that.\n\n890\n00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,670\nBut if we are sending files through email,\n\n891\n00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,110\na lot of those things are limited\nto about ten megabytes.\n\n892\n00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:59,990\nSo it may be where we have to actually go\nahead and be able to, to check that out\n\n893\n00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,960\nand limit our file size by knowing where\nwe can find out how big those files are.\n\n894\n00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,780\nSo those are different\nways that we can do that.\n\n895\n00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:13,150\nNow, if you again,\ngo towards your A+ certification.\n\n896\n00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,847\nYou're gonna also end up seeing\nwhere you can see this inside of\n\n897\n00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,024\nthe command line interface as well.\n\n898\n00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:23,328\nTo be able to determine how big those\nfiles are even by using commands that you\n\n899\n00:57:23,328 --> 00:57:24,610\ncan type in.\n\n900\n00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:28,080\nSo, if you're looking forward to that,\ngo through the A Plus Series, and\n\n901\n00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,370\nyou'll learn everything that\nyou wanted to ever know.\n\n902\n00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,910\nAbout making sure that you\ncould do stuff like that too.\n\n903\n00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,632\nThat's kind of easy for\nus to be able to cover and do.\n\n904\n00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:42,450\nAll right, the next option that we have\nfor navigating around an operating system.\n\n905\n00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,880\nReally has to do with what we\ncall the accessibility options.\n\n906\n00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,580\nNow, the accessibility options have\nbeen around in just about every\n\n907\n00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,820\nWindows operating system.\n\n908\n00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,060\nThat's kind of existed for a long time.\n\n909\n00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,100\nI, I remember them in Windows 98,\nthey may have been in Windows 95,\n\n910\n00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,350\nI don't know why I can't\nremember if they were or not.\n\n911\n00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,380\nBut I know that they've been around for\na long time.\n\n912\n00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,930\nThe easiest way to find out what we\ncall the accessibility options is\n\n913\n00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,090\nby going into control panel.\n\n914\n00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,270\nSo I click on Start.\n\n915\n00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,580\nAnd in the second column,\nI'm looking for Control Panel.\n\n916\n00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,550\nAnd inside of Control Panel,\nnotice that one of\n\n917\n00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:24,940\nthe large groupings that we have is\nright here that says Ease of Access.\n\n918\n00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,170\nThese are the accessibility options\nthat make it easy, then for\n\n919\n00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,770\nsomeone to be able to use\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n920\n00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,270\nTo, okay?\n\n921\n00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,840\nSo I'm going to click on ease of access.\n\n922\n00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,480\nAnd then, once I get there,\nI'm going to select it again.\n\n923\n00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,810\nAnd, watch, you see.\n\n924\n00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,180\nThere's a couple of different\nthings that are going on.\n\n925\n00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,250\nI'm gonna uncheck this where it's reading\nit out loud because I can hear it\n\n926\n00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,330\ncoming through.\n\n927\n00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,370\nOn my computer.\n\n928\n00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,210\nNotice what it says right\nup here at the top.\n\n929\n00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,180\nIt says,\nto make your computer easier to use.\n\n930\n00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,330\nSo it says, quick access to common tools.\n\n931\n00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:04,960\nIf somebody is not really\nable to see the desktop,\n\n932\n00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,460\nit can read out loud by using\nwhat we call, the narrator.\n\n933\n00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,820\nThe narrator instead can read any text\nthat's on the screen out loud to us.\n\n934\n00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,530\nAnd it does it but\nit's not in a natural reading voice.\n\n935\n00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,940\nIt will sound computerized too.\n\n936\n00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,990\nWe also have a screen magnifier that\nallows us to enlarge all the text on\n\n937\n00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,400\nthe screen.\n\n938\n00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,170\nAnd of course,\nwe have an onscreen keyboard.\n\n939\n00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:33,260\nThat can also help out if the keys\nare not able to be punched in.\n\n940\n00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,240\nWe can then actually just use our\nmouse to click around on the screen.\n\n941\n00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,880\nIf you happen to be one of those people\nthat can not see, like well you like,\n\n942\n00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,620\nlet's say night blindness, right.\n\n943\n00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,650\nHigh contrast is probably the way to go,\ntoo.\n\n944\n00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,340\nSo that now you can actually\nhave like a black and\n\n945\n00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,570\nwhite screen or a black and\nmagenta screen if you want to.\n\n946\n00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,620\nTo allow the contrast to, to, again,\n\n947\n00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,190\neliminate some of that eyestrain that\nyou may also deal with, as well.\n\n948\n00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,750\nNow, those are not the only\noptions that we have available.\n\n949\n01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,054\nNotice that this is the, the, funniest\none that I always think about here.\n\n950\n01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:11,268\nWhere it says to optimize the use\nof Windows 7 for blindness is,\n\n951\n01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:15,250\nto me, is kinda probably\nthe hardest one to understand.\n\n952\n01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,620\nAnd it gives me options to use\nthe computer without a display.\n\n953\n01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:25,430\nSo if I select that, it gives me all these\noptions where I can turn on the narrator.\n\n954\n01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,795\nSo that now the person\ndoesn't need the display.\n\n955\n01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:30,080\nYou'll actually be able\nto hear what's on what,\n\n956\n01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,760\nwhat's actually printed on the screen.\n\n957\n01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,440\nAnd, even audio descriptions about what's\nactually happening also in videos too.\n\n958\n01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,250\nAnd you might have to go through\nsome configuration to do so.\n\n959\n01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:44,450\nWe can also have some time limits\nthat we actually adjust, so\n\n960\n01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:45,770\nthat everything stays open for\n\n961\n01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:49,750\na little bit longer time, as we're\ntrying to figure out what to do next.\n\n962\n01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,580\nThe other options, of course,\nmake it easier to see on the computer.\n\n963\n01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:01,440\nVisualizing the display, where we can\nturn on the high contrast themes or\n\n964\n01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,370\nthe magnifier.\n\n965\n01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,840\nNow the magnifier is a little bit\ndisconcerting here, let me go ahead and\n\n966\n01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,668\nturn the magnifier on and apply it.\n\n967\n01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:12,076\nClick okay.\n\n968\n01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:16,250\nAll right, give it a second, and\nwe'll see a magnifier come, maybe.\n\n969\n01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,060\nThere we go.\n\n970\n01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:19,750\nOkay.\n\n971\n01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,690\nUp at the top edge of the screen.\n\n972\n01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,540\nOkay.\n\n973\n01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,260\nIs, if I could not see\nthe text on my screen,\n\n974\n01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,380\nI can actually use that magnifier and\nyou see where that,\n\n975\n01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:36,070\nshe shows me is in much easier for\nme to be able to take a look at.\n\n976\n01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:40,960\nNow I can control that by going to this\nmagnifying glass on the left hand side.\n\n977\n01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,750\nOr I can zoom in.\n\n978\n01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,287\nLet me see if it actually lets me.\n\n979\n01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:49,270\nThere's 300%, but that bar is\nnot really getting a lot higher.\n\n980\n01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:54,030\nNow, I can actually adjust it, little bit\nmore, so I can see a little bit more of\n\n981\n01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:58,760\nthe desktop or less of the desktop and\nmore of the magnification.\n\n982\n01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,230\nSo, anywhere that I go, on the screen.\n\n983\n01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,840\nIt can do that, and allow me to see,\na little bit better,\n\n984\n01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,330\nespecially if you're as blind as I am,\nit really does help.\n\n985\n01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,950\nI've just turned that off,\nat least I hope I turned it off.\n\n986\n01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,730\nAnd of course there's other things,\nespecially with the keyboards.\n\n987\n01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,870\nUsing the onscreen keyboard\nis another fashion,\n\n988\n01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,910\nis another way to be able to\ntype in what you need to.\n\n989\n01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:33,480\nAnd maybe your hands are not\nable to use a standard keyboard.\n\n990\n01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,250\nInstead, you actually\nlike clicking around.\n\n991\n01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,020\nYou can of course use\nthe onscreen keyboard.\n\n992\n01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,570\nAnd then it says to avoid using\nthe mouse and the keyboard.\n\n993\n01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:49,160\nThey even have built in screen rec, or,\nspeech recognition and this is not bad.\n\n994\n01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,760\nA lot of times you can do this and\nit actually works fairly well.\n\n995\n01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,654\nIt will take some simple commands for you\nto be able to navigate around Windows 7.\n\n996\n01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:01,010\nNow there's plenty of different options\navailable to us to be able to do that.\n\n997\n01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,420\nAnd let's see some of the other\noptions that we have down here if\n\n998\n01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,190\nI can scroll down a little bit more.\n\n999\n01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,710\nThe keyboard easier to use.\n\n1000\n01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:14,710\nMouse keys says use numeric\nkeypad to move the mouse around.\n\n1001\n01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:16,830\nSo instead of having an actual mouse,\n\n1002\n01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:20,250\nyou may actually use that little\nkeypad over on the right hand side.\n\n1003\n01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,160\nThis is the one that I, I absolutely hate,\nwhich is the sticky keys.\n\n1004\n01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,410\nNotice that it says press keyboard\nshortcuts one key at a time.\n\n1005\n01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:31,030\nSometimes it may be\nbecause hands are shaking.\n\n1006\n01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,510\nWhere you actually accidentally\npress a key more than one time\n\n1007\n01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:39,400\ninstead we can use the Sticky Keys,\nToggle Keys, filtering keys out for\n\n1008\n01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,870\nmultiple key strokes of the same key.\n\n1009\n01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:45,640\nYou name it, there's plenty of\nother ones that we do see out here.\n\n1010\n01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,940\nAll right?\n\n1011\n01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,037\nYou can even add in the Dvorak\nkeyboard if you choose to.\n\n1012\n01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:53,464\nSo there's plenty of different\naccessibility options available to\n\n1013\n01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:54,158\nyou and I.\n\n1014\n01:03:54,158 --> 01:03:57,293\nYou and me.\n\n1015\n01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:59,389\nAll right.\nI don't see anything else.\n\n1016\n01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:03,540\nReading and typing,\nalternatives for sounds.\n\n1017\n01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,250\nSo, there's other options that\nyou may want to go ahead and\n\n1018\n01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:10,840\nexplore if your user is actually\nnot able to, to get around their,\n\n1019\n01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,730\ntheir computer you know,\nwith without any difficulties.\n\n1020\n01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,560\nUsually, the one that is,\nis when people can't really see,\n\n1021\n01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,910\nthat magnifier kind of helps out the most.\n\n1022\n01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,280\nThe other ones, if you're alone,\n\n1023\n01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,090\nthe narrator probably isn't\ngoing to disturb you.\n\n1024\n01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,620\nIf you're with other people,\nit probably will.\n\n1025\n01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,340\nAll right.\n\n1026\n01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,200\nSo, there's some of the ease\nof accessibility options.\n\n1027\n01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,478\nNow, the last one that I\nreally saved here is, or\n\n1028\n01:04:31,478 --> 01:04:34,156\nactually there's two more that,\nthat we need to cover.\n\n1029\n01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:37,998\nBut this one is all about\nkeyboard shortcuts or\n\n1030\n01:04:37,998 --> 01:04:40,545\nwhat we call hot keys as well.\n\n1031\n01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:44,110\nThere's several different ways\nthat we can just use hot keys\n\n1032\n01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:48,800\nto help us to be able to navigate a lot\nquicker throughout the operating system.\n\n1033\n01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,144\nSo, one of the primary keys that you\nshould get used to using is just\n\n1034\n01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:53,412\nthe simple Windows key.\n\n1035\n01:04:53,412 --> 01:04:57,785\nAnd when this key automatically just\nallows us to launch the start the start\n\n1036\n01:04:57,785 --> 01:05:00,320\nmenu, I couldn't remember\nwhat it's called.\n\n1037\n01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,691\nAnd from there,\nonce we have the start menu,\n\n1038\n01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:08,939\nI can now use my arrow keys on my\nkeyboard to be able to navigate around.\n\n1039\n01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:16,420\nSo, notice how I can actually move using\nthe different arrow keys on my laptop.\n\n1040\n01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,840\nI can go in to the documents,\n\n1041\n01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,140\nI select documents or\nI hover over documents, I press enter.\n\n1042\n01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,620\nI can now navigate into\nthe documents folder.\n\n1043\n01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:31,970\nFrom there, I can use my tab key,\nand I can actually watch and see\n\n1044\n01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:38,370\nthat the tab key is actually moving\nme across the screen left to right.\n\n1045\n01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:43,096\nAnd so, now I've used my tab key and\nI've selected show notes.\n\n1046\n01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:49,420\nI have to select it first, I hit my\nspacebar and then, I can hit enter.\n\n1047\n01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,250\nAnd continue to navigate using that.\n\n1048\n01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,216\nNow, those are some of the simple\nkeys that we have, but\n\n1049\n01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,890\nthere's other keys that are also\navailable to you and me, too.\n\n1050\n01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,090\nSo, let's do some of the things\nwe did at the beginning.\n\n1051\n01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:06,850\nLet's say, that what I want to do,\nis I want to make a copy of this file.\n\n1052\n01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:11,344\nWell, I can simply select it,\nand then, I can do a Ctrl+C.\n\n1053\n01:06:11,344 --> 01:06:13,520\nCtrl+C stands for, well, copy.\n\n1054\n01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,460\nThen I can do a CTRL+V, and\n\n1055\n01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,880\nnotice it actually made a copy and\nit pasted it here for me too.\n\n1056\n01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,056\nAll right.\n\n1057\n01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:25,400\nI'm gonna delete that right out.\n\n1058\n01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:33,805\nI can also cut that by doing CTRL+X and\n\n1059\n01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:42,744\nthen, I can go to another\nlocation within show notes.\n\n1060\n01:06:42,744 --> 01:06:44,770\nAnd then, I can do a Ctrl+V,\n\n1061\n01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,830\nand also be able to move a copy\nof that file in the show notes.\n\n1062\n01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:55,380\nVery simple commands for\nus to be able to use, but very effective.\n\n1063\n01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,290\nThe more that our hands\nare on the keyboard,\n\n1064\n01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,560\nthe more productivity we'll have.\n\n1065\n01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:06,618\nWe've also seen that with the ability\n\n1066\n01:07:06,618 --> 01:07:11,537\nto save, if I open up WordPad,\n\n1067\n01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:18,163\nthis is a file used for\na demonstration for\n\n1068\n01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:22,920\nsaving a file using Ctrl+S.\n\n1069\n01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,090\nAll right.\n\n1070\n01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:30,810\nWhen we have a file that we\nhave now created, by default,\n\n1071\n01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:35,550\nwhatever that program actually names it,\nis what we call the, the actual template.\n\n1072\n01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,860\nIt doesn't want us to save\nanything as that template, so\n\n1073\n01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,350\nthis one's called document.\n\n1074\n01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:45,360\nAnd, if I do a Ctrl and the letter S,\nit automatically brings up a Save As,\n\n1075\n01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:50,560\ngives me now the ability\nto type in a name for\n\n1076\n01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,220\nthat file, and then, I can click Save.\n\n1077\n01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,060\nThe advantage of using the Ctrl+S,\n\n1078\n01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:02,680\nof course, is if more if I need\nto go ahead and edit more.\n\n1079\n01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:11,398\nSo, edited file by Ronnie Wong and\nI still need to do some more typing.\n\n1080\n01:08:11,398 --> 01:08:14,997\nSomebody called me, I can just\nsimply go ahead and do a Ctrl+S.\n\n1081\n01:08:14,997 --> 01:08:19,943\nAnd instead, what that did is overwrites\nthe original file, so now I don't\n\n1082\n01:08:19,943 --> 01:08:25,740\nhave to stop and find my mouse, click on\nfile, and then, click on save to do it.\n\n1083\n01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:29,920\nI can simply use those simple commands\nto help us to be able to do that saving.\n\n1084\n01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,726\nNow, those are some of the most simple\nshortcuts that anybody should know.\n\n1085\n01:08:35,726 --> 01:08:41,890\nCtrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+S.\n\n1086\n01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,310\nThose are kinda at least the basic ones.\n\n1087\n01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:47,890\nBut there are some other ones that can\nhelp make life a little bit easier.\n\n1088\n01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,330\nLet's say, that what we wanted to\ndo is that we had multiple files,\n\n1089\n01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:57,100\nI wanted to put them\ninside of another folder.\n\n1090\n01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,930\nI can also do a.\n\n1091\n01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,210\nThis is the, the one that's\na little bit more unusual here.\n\n1092\n01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:09,237\nThis is when we do a Ctrl+Shift+N and\nthat automatically creates a new folder.\n\n1093\n01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:17,702\nNow, with that new folder,\n\n1094\n01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:22,843\nI can go ahead and do a Ctrl+X on Test1.\n\n1095\n01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:24,944\nSelect folder one and do a Ctrl+V.\n\n1096\n01:09:27,603 --> 01:09:29,210\nOr maybe not.\n\n1097\n01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,290\nNope.\n\n1098\n01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:34,240\nI probably should not have, oh, I probably\nshould have gone inside of that folder,\n\n1099\n01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:34,795\ndo a Ctrl+V.\n\n1100\n01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,887\nOh, now, I selected folder one,\nthat's why.\n\n1101\n01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,490\nThat didn't help.\n\n1102\n01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:45,110\nLet me do a Ctrl+X, and then,\ngo inside Folder1 and do a Ctrl+V.\n\n1103\n01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,840\nThat will actually work better\ninstead of trying to do that.\n\n1104\n01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:53,060\nSo, it gives me that ability to\nkeep my hands on the keyboard and\n\n1105\n01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,240\nto continue to, to work and\ndo all the things that I need to do.\n\n1106\n01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,572\nNow, if I open up multiple programs.\n\n1107\n01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:03,270\nI'm gonna open up this calculator,\n\n1108\n01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:08,880\nand paint and let's do one more.\n\n1109\n01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,320\nLet's do this WordPad here.\n\n1110\n01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,370\nOkay.\n\n1111\n01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:18,074\nIf I do something like this, I can\nalso use my [SOUND], Windows key here.\n\n1112\n01:10:18,074 --> 01:10:21,092\nAnd well, let me see if I can,\nI'm lying to you.\n\n1113\n01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,445\nWindows key.\n\n1114\n01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:27,410\nHello.\n\n1115\n01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:28,330\nIt's not really letting me.\n\n1116\n01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,750\nYou know what.\n\n1117\n01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,872\nGet outside of the screen\nis what I'm trying to.\n\n1118\n01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:37,280\nAlt+Tab.\n\n1119\n01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,140\nThere we go.\n\n1120\n01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,030\nI was trying to bring this menu up here.\n\n1121\n01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,220\nI just couldn't see the right keys here.\n\n1122\n01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:45,005\nThis allows me to switch\nbetween programs very easily.\n\n1123\n01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:51,822\nSo, notice I can actually simply use that,\nan alt and\n\n1124\n01:10:51,822 --> 01:10:57,090\na tab key to navigate around very\neasily between multiple programs.\n\n1125\n01:10:59,563 --> 01:11:03,120\nSo, one actually just replaces\nthe other one as we, as we see that.\n\n1126\n01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,640\nEvery once in a while,\nthere's also a need, of course,\n\n1127\n01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,930\nto bring up the task manager.\n\n1128\n01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:16,358\nAnd this is where we can\nalso use Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\n1129\n01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:20,491\nAnd that will give me access to the task\nmanager without me having to right\n\n1130\n01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:23,080\nclick on anything to be\nable to bring that up.\n\n1131\n01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,690\nAnd now, I can see the applications\nthat are running in the background,\n\n1132\n01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:33,240\nprocesses and services, performance,\nnetworking, you name it.\n\n1133\n01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,800\nWe can actually use those different\nshortcuts to help us to get around our\n\n1134\n01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,340\noperating system a little bit easier.\n\n1135\n01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,777\nSo, knowing their simple shortcuts will\nreally help you out in a productive\n\n1136\n01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:43,466\nenvironment.\n\n1137\n01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,960\nSo that, you always are to keep\nin your hands on that keyboard.\n\n1138\n01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,715\nOkay.\nOur last little bit that we have in this\n\n1139\n01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:54,481\nsection is dealing with what we\ncall File and Folder Permissions.\n\n1140\n01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,943\nEvery time that we create a folder,\nthere's gon,\n\n1141\n01:11:57,943 --> 01:12:03,270\nthey're gonna end up inheriting what\nwe call, some different permissions.\n\n1142\n01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:07,750\nSo, just like what I showed\nyou a little bit earlier here,\n\n1143\n01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:12,640\non folder number one,\nif I right-click on folder number one and\n\n1144\n01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,190\nI go to Properties, and\nI select the Security tab,\n\n1145\n01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,640\nI can see that there's a whole\nlist of different permissions.\n\n1146\n01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:28,570\nWhat this list shows me is that\nthe system, the operating system itself.\n\n1147\n01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,510\nMe, the administrators for\n\n1148\n01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:38,150\nthis Windows 7 computer has these\npermissions available to him.\n\n1149\n01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,930\nFull control pretty much means we\ncan do anything that we want to.\n\n1150\n01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,630\nNow, when we take a look at that,\nthose permissions are not assigned by me.\n\n1151\n01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,860\nThe operating system has\nassigned them at a higher level.\n\n1152\n01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,960\nSo that now,\nanything that Sachi would end this folder,\n\n1153\n01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,120\nfolder one, you'll probably\nalso see that system Ronnie and\n\n1154\n01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,620\nthe administrators will end up\ngetting the same level permissions.\n\n1155\n01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:10,129\nSo remember that I had that\nfile called Test1 in here.\n\n1156\n01:13:10,129 --> 01:13:14,930\nIf I right-click and\nI go to Properties here, and\n\n1157\n01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:20,510\nI select the Security tab,\nnotice system, Ronnie,\n\n1158\n01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:24,730\nand administrators, they will also\nhave those same permissions, too.\n\n1159\n01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,680\nIt's a very good thing, because it\nmeans that all of the permissions that\n\n1160\n01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,825\nare assigned to a folder, those files and\n\n1161\n01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,030\nsub-folders within that folder will\nalso inherit those same permissions.\n\n1162\n01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:40,330\nIt means that you and I don't have\nto go around and explicitly assign\n\n1163\n01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:45,540\nevery single permission, so that users\ncan gain access to those folders.\n\n1164\n01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,570\nIt also means that you and\nI can control that if we need to.\n\n1165\n01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:53,718\nFor those of you that are going on towards\nyour A+ and your Network+ certification,\n\n1166\n01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:56,367\nand your Windows 7 or, or\nWindows 8 certification,\n\n1167\n01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:59,760\nyou'll learn more about file and\nfolder permissions.\n\n1168\n01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,200\nIt allows us to take a single resource,\nsuch as a folder,\n\n1169\n01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:08,070\nbe able to assign different permissions to\ndifferent people on that same resource.\n\n1170\n01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,410\nSo maybe where you have full control, and\n\n1171\n01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,490\nI only have read-only\naccess to that folder.\n\n1172\n01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:17,070\nSo that way, we can actually have very,\nvery granular control,\n\n1173\n01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:20,790\nvery detailed controls on who\ncan access that folder and\n\n1174\n01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,570\nwhat level of permissions that they\nhave on those folders and files too.\n\n1175\n01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,070\nSo you'll deal with that more and\n\n1176\n01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:30,080\nmore as you go on and\ncontinue to see that in your IT career.\n\n1177\n01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,080\nBut at this point, we're just trying\nto demonstrate that they do exist.\n\n1178\n01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,120\nSometimes a person is not\nable to gain access to\n\n1179\n01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,090\na resource because they don't have\nthe permissions that they need to be able\n\n1180\n01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:47,930\nto gain access to that resource such as\na file or a printer, or even a folder.\n\n1181\n01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,749\nBut if their name is on there or if they\nare part of a group that's actually on\n\n1182\n01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:55,870\nthat list, then they'll have those levels\nof permissions to deal with, all right?\n\n1183\n01:14:57,030 --> 01:15:00,030\nSo in this episode,\nwe really did take a look\n\n1184\n01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,990\nat some of the different ways that you and\nI can navigate around an operating system.\n\n1185\n01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,940\nWe took the very basic file and\n\n1186\n01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,730\nshowed you how we can manipulate\nthat file by copying it.\n\n1187\n01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:12,930\nBy cutting it and\nmoving it to a different location.\n\n1188\n01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:15,670\nBy deleting it and even renaming it.\n\n1189\n01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,880\nWe also took a look at file and\nfolder permissions, and that\n\n1190\n01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:24,000\nwe can actually control access to those\nresources by using those permissions.\n\n1191\n01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,110\nWe showed you some of the different\nshortcuts that are available so\n\n1192\n01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:30,020\nthat we can keep our hands on\nthe keyboard to become more productive.\n\n1193\n01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,580\nWe also showed you some of\nthe information that come,\n\n1194\n01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,760\nthat you can also find\non the files themselves.\n\n1195\n01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,170\nAnd, we also showed you how you can\ndisplay certain files by using filters or\n\n1196\n01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,420\neven be able to sort and\n\n1197\n01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:45,130\ndisplay them differently\ndepending on what you need to do.\n\n1198\n01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:51,580\nLastly, we also took a look at being able\nto navigate around using Windows Explorer.\n\n1199\n01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,650\nThese are some of the most basic things\nthat we have to be familiar with\n\n1200\n01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:59,820\nif we are going to be helping\nothers in an IT career and\n\n1201\n01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,330\nsupporting them as they're using Windows\n7 or even any other operating system.\n\n1202\n01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,600\nSome of the other things that we did,\nall these things,\n\n1203\n01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,690\nwe'll probably have to do regardless\nof whether you're on Windows 7,\n\n1204\n01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:12,280\nor whether you're actually\nworking in Mac OS 10, or\n\n1205\n01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,970\neven in Linux as to be able to help out\nand be able to find this this information.\n\n1206\n01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:20,770\nSo even though we specifically\nonly stuck with Windows today,\n\n1207\n01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:23,910\nmost of the same concepts will\nactually apply even there,\n\n1208\n01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:28,800\neven though it won't specifically apply on\nthe details in how we actually got there.\n\n1209\n01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,940\nSo remember that as you\ncontinue on towards your study,\n\n1210\n01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:35,190\nnot only for your IT fundamentals, but\nalso as you move on towards your next step\n\n1211\n01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:39,900\nin your certification goals,\ntoo, for our A+ studies.\n\n1212\n01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,740\nAs always, if you're ali,\nalive and you wanna watch you know,\n\n1213\n01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:49,770\nwhile we're actually here alive, you can\nalways interact with us in our chat room.\n\n1214\n01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,280\nBy being able to post questions there,\n\n1215\n01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,950\nwe try and answer them alive\nas we're actually on screen.\n\n1216\n01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,550\nIf you happen to be watching this episode,\n\n1217\n01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:01,510\nand it's in a recorded format,\nremember to jump on over onto our webpage.\n\n1218\n01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:06,727\nOn every single webpage that we have on,\non top of every single page is the Q&A,\n\n1219\n01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,100\nand that will lead you\ndirectly to our forums.\n\n1220\n01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,140\nThat will allow you to\npost questions there.\n\n1221\n01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,540\nWe monitor and we answer there, too.\n\n1222\n01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,320\nSo take advantage of that as a resource\nfor you as you continue on and\n\n1223\n01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,590\ntowards your preparations for\nthe IT fundamentals, and\n\n1224\n01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,270\neven towards other certification goals.\n\n1225\n01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,921\nWe hoped you enjoyed the show today.\n\n1226\n01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:29,011\nAnd if you have, please continue to\nwatch for more of this coming up.\n\n1227\n01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:33,983\nAnd, signing off for IT Pro TV my name is\nRonnie Wong and we'll see you next time.\n\n1228\n01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:40,709\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,210\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,040\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,070\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,040\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,452\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:45,010\nAnother beautiful day here in Florida.\n\n11\n00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,820\nA little bit chilly, but\nit's a great day for IT fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,370\n>> Chilly with a chance of rain.\n\n13\n00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,944\n>> That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,360\n>> All right, well Ronnie we\nare diving right back into CompT,\n\n15\n00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,500\nIT Fundamentals today.\n\n16\n00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,990\nAnd we've got basic,\nwell here, the full objective.\n\n17\n00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,800\nWe're doing objective 5.3.\n\n18\n00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,050\nGiven a scenario,\nimplement basic support concepts.\n\n19\n00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,300\nAnd what this objective is all about,\nis when you get a new computer,\n\n20\n00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,400\nyou take it out of the box,\nright, like we did in 5.1.\n\n21\n00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,550\nAnd we're getting that set up.\n\n22\n00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,540\nWhat if it doesn't work?\n\n23\n00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,720\nWell, if you, you hook up all the cables,\nyou hit the power button and\n\n24\n00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,730\nnothing happens, or other types\nof issues arise, what do we do?\n\n25\n00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,060\nWhat are our basic support steps?\n\n26\n00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,030\nNow, for those of you that are going\non to do, like, a A plus certification,\n\n27\n00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,220\nyou're gonna learn all\nsorts of advanced things.\n\n28\n00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,190\nBut we're gonna cover here the basic\nsteps that really, any person who's\n\n29\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,480\nbuying a computer should be aware of as\nthey go through just the initial setup.\n\n30\n00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,990\nYou know.\n\n31\n00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,030\n>> In supporting a, a computer setup, once\nwe get it set up, one of the first things\n\n32\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,880\nespecially if nothing's working,\nis to check the physical connections.\n\n33\n00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720\nIt's very easy to plug everything in and\n\n34\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,890\ndo like I do, forget to plug like,\nthe power cable in.\n\n35\n00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,810\nEven though I've got it\nplugged into the power supply,\n\n36\n00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,110\nforgetting to actually connect it right to\nthe wall outlet or to a power strip, or\n\n37\n00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,400\neven turning on the power strip.\n\n38\n00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,990\nYou know, that's, some,\nsomething like that is actually very easy.\n\n39\n00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,580\n>> Yeah, any time I buy something new and\n\n40\n00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,985\nit doesn't work,\n>> I get this moment of.\n\n41\n00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,450\n>> [LAUGH] panic\n>> not so\n\n42\n00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,760\nmuch panic as much as it is like dread and\nI'm like ugh,\n\n43\n00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,570\nI'm gonna have to deal with tech support\nor I'm going to have to return this.\n\n44\n00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,238\nI'm gonna ship it back.\n\n45\n00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,620\nIt's all this burden, like when you buy\nsomething you just expect it to work.\n\n46\n00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,970\nSo ideally you can do everything you can\nto avoid having to send it back, right.\n\n47\n00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,380\n>> Yep.\n>> Having to create that delay.\n\n48\n00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,920\nGetting this thing to work if you can,\nbut at the same time,\n\n49\n00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,420\nyou don't wanna keep something\nthat's not as it should be, right?\n\n50\n00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,630\nYou don't wanna,\nto receive a broken device and say,\n\n51\n00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,994\nwell I guess I'll just keep\nit cuz I'm in a hurry.\n\n52\n00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,920\n[LAUGH] You, you know,\nyou paid full price for something,\n\n53\n00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,140\nyou should be able to\nexpect to get that product.\n\n54\n00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,050\nAnd hopefully it's something simple.\n\n55\n00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,170\nRonnie, you hit the nail on the head.\n\n56\n00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,740\n>> A loose cable or connection can make\nit look like the entire computer is dead,\n\n58\n00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,960\nand we just need to tighten that up.\n\n59\n00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,930\nSo, all those cables that we hooked up in\nObjective 5.1, when we plugged in the,\n\n60\n00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,750\nthe mouse, the keyboard, the monitor.\n\n61\n00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,090\nThe power cables, right?\n\n62\n00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,120\nPower on the monitor,\npower on the computer, the speakers.\n\n63\n00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,700\nThat's a lot of cables to hook up.\n\n64\n00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,780\nSome of them can be mixed up,\n\n65\n00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,740\nsome of them might feel like they're\nin but not actually be all the way in.\n\n66\n00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,970\nPS2 ports are really bad about that.\n\n67\n00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,190\nSometimes PS2 ports will grab on\nthe circle, shielding on the outside, but\n\n68\n00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,110\nthe pins aren't actually in the slots.\n\n69\n00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,490\nI've done that more than once.\n\n70\n00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,080\nSo it looks like the cable is all\nthe way in, but it actually isn't.\n\n71\n00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,890\nSo, just go through and unplug the cable,\nand plug the cable back in, and\n\n72\n00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,180\nmake sure it's seated nice and firm.\n\n73\n00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,010\nAlso check the cables,\nif it's, if it's a male cable,\n\n74\n00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,970\nif it's got pins in it,\njust visually inspect the pins.\n\n75\n00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,260\nMake sure there's no bent or broken pins.\n\n76\n00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,500\nYou may simply have a bad cable, and\nthe rest of the equipment is just fine.\n\n77\n00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,290\nSo you just need to,\nto replace that one component.\n\n78\n00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,180\n>> Yep.\n>> Right.\n\n79\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,840\nBut if we start examining that and\nthings still aren't working for us,\n\n80\n00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,680\nthere's a few other things we can check,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,290\nLike what's on the list here is, power.\n\n82\n00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,080\n>> Well, we, we did mention power\na little bit when I, I described it, but\n\n83\n00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,600\nnot only is the AC outlet, now Don,\nthis happened in my house.\n\n84\n00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,380\nI have one of those walls that has two you\nknow little light, light switches on and\n\n85\n00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,140\nI didn't realize that one of those\nlight switches actually controls one of\n\n86\n00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,785\nthe power outlets.\n\n87\n00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I went to turn it off and\n\n88\n00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,530\nthen I went to plug my computer\nin to charge and like,\n\n89\n00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,160\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n90\n00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,940\nEven simple things like that.\n\n91\n00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,390\nBut the other thing is we, we rely on so\nmany wireless devices today\n\n92\n00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,100\nthat it could be just the battery\nitself is just not connected.\n\n93\n00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,160\nJust recently I can't remember\nwhat device it was but\n\n94\n00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,125\nnow they have these little plastic slips\nthat they put in between the batteries.\n\n95\n00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:30,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n96\n00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,690\n>> And a, a lot of times they have\na little a little little piece of plastic.\n\n97\n00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,240\n>> A tab or something.\n\n98\n00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,590\n>> that yeah that pulls it out.\n\n99\n00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,890\nBut this one didn't.\n\n100\n00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,430\nSo I had to actually undo, and actually\npull it out from the battery, so it was\n\n101\n00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,710\noff, even though it didn't have anything,\nI had to go into the instructions itself.\n\n102\n00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,370\nIt said, remove the safety,\nor whatever, the,\n\n103\n00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,200\nthe plastic wrap around the battery\nbefore that should work.\n\n104\n00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,591\nSo, sometimes Don doesn't panic, but I do.\n\n105\n00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,383\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, I'm like,\n\n106\n00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:57,040\nI can't believe I just paid money for\nthis thing, now I've gotta return it.\n\n107\n00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,850\nTo, to get it done.\n\n108\n00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,810\nSo, so remember,\nit's not only about the AC power,\n\n109\n00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,220\nbut also about the battery power too.\n\n110\n00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,747\n>> Yeah, and, and\nyou'd see batteries if you\n\n111\n00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,970\nhad like a wireless keyboard-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n112\n00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,430\n>> Or a wireless mouse.\n\n113\n00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,435\nYou, you have batteries in a laptop.\n\n114\n00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:10,135\n>> Mm-hm.\nBut they normally\n\n115\n00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:10,935\ndon't put the little pull\n>> Right.\n\n116\n00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145\n>> tabs in there because\nthey're rechargeable.\n\n117\n00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,305\nBut when you get a wireless keyboard or\nmouse, they're normally just regular\n\n118\n00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:19,475\nbatteries and I know a lot of companies\nship them where the batteries are outside\n\n119\n00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,545\nof the keyboard, but\nif they're actually in the keyboard or\n\n120\n00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:24,335\nin the mouse when you receive it, if they\ndidn't put that little tab in there,\n\n121\n00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,295\nthe battery would drain while\nit was sitting on the shelf.\n\n122\n00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:28,775\nSo that's why they do that,\nbut it is easy to, to forget.\n\n123\n00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,440\n>> Yeah\n>> For me, when it comes to power there,\n\n124\n00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,710\nthere's a couple things\nthat I always mess up.\n\n125\n00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,640\nOne is when you hook up a computer,\nyou got a lot of power, so\n\n126\n00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,210\nthe, the devices we were hooking up in\nthe earlier episode, we did a speaker bar\n\n127\n00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,840\nthat had a power plug, the tower's\npower supply had one and the monitor.\n\n128\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360\nSo that's already three devices\nright there on a standard computer.\n\n129\n00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,650\nYour wall socket likely\nonly has two connectors.\n\n130\n00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,660\nSo you're probably gonna\nuse a power strip.\n\n131\n00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,490\nAnd your power strip will usually\nhave an on/off switch on it.\n\n132\n00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,730\nSo that could be off.\n\n133\n00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,920\nAnd it also usually has a circuit in there\nas, to act as a minor surge suppressor.\n\n134\n00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,800\nSo it could be tripped.\n\n135\n00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,080\nThere's usually, like,\na reset button on those.\n\n136\n00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,460\nYou could always troubleshoot by\ntaking the power strip out and\n\n137\n00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,500\nplugging directly into the wall just\nto test, try a different power socket.\n\n138\n00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,280\nThose are all different\nthings that we can check.\n\n139\n00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160\nBut, it is always possible\nthe power supply can be damaged.\n\n140\n00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,960\nAnother thing to keep in mind on power,\nsome power supplies have a little switch\n\n141\n00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,020\non the back that lets them\nmove between 110 volt and\n\n142\n00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,350\n220 volt outlets or,\nsometimes they say 120 and 240.\n\n143\n00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,160\nHere in the United States all of\nour wall sockets are 110 volt but\n\n144\n00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,730\nin other countries,\nit's more common to find 220 volt.\n\n145\n00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,660\nSo you need to make sure\nthat switch is right.\n\n146\n00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,300\nOther power supplies though\nlike the one we had on the show\n\n147\n00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,760\nit was a auto-sensing one so,\nit didn't have the switch.\n\n148\n00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,350\nThat may not be a problem\nthat you bump into.\n\n149\n00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,770\nAnd then,\n\n150\n00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,550\nthe last thing we need is, if it's just\nnot working, check for physical damage.\n\n151\n00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,550\nIf the computer was shipped to you,\n\n152\n00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,790\nit really doesn't matter which shipping\nprovider you use, FedEx, UPS, whatever.\n\n153\n00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,990\nThey're all pretty rough-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n154\n00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,238\n>> With the packaging.\n\n155\n00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,030\nAnd that's why the computer vendors put so\n\n156\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,560\nmuch styrofoam in there\nto pack the system.\n\n157\n00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,260\nBut you know, I, I remember the first\ntime I, I built my own computer.\n\n158\n00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260\nI, I went into\nthe Computer Shopper magazine, and\n\n159\n00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,610\nI found all the different parts I wanted.\n\n160\n00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,740\nI ordered them.\n\n161\n00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,640\nAnd the day my motherboard showed up,\nit was in this box, And\n\n162\n00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,626\nit was just I mean it looked like\nsomebody stepped on the center of it.\n\n163\n00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it was bent and\n\n164\n00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,140\nI mean it was just mangled.\n\n165\n00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,320\nAnd so when I opened it up,\n\n166\n00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,730\nI just fully expected the motherboard\nto be snapped in half.\n\n167\n00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,890\nAnd it was actually intact.\n\n168\n00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,440\nIt was fine.\n\n169\n00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,600\nBut before I even bothered installing it I\ndid a visual inspection just to look for\n\n170\n00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,356\nany cracks in the silicone wafers,\nany of that stuff.\n\n171\n00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,903\nYou know?\nYou just have to, to look.\n\n172\n00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:41,920\nAnd if it's damaged in transit,\nthen you might have to do\n\n173\n00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,860\na claim against the shipping\ncompany to get you know, a refund.\n\n174\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,320\nYour shipment is normally insured.\n\n175\n00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,297\nThe main reason we,\n\n176\n00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:52,352\nwe need to know this is we need to\nknow who to go to to get it fixed.\n\n177\n00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:56,829\nDamage in shipping is different than a\nmanufacturer defect, A manufacturer defect\n\n178\n00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:59,865\nwe go to whoever sold us\nthe computer to get them to fix it.\n\n179\n00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,105\nBy damage in shipping,\nwe've got to go to the shipping carrier.\n\n180\n00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:02,882\n>> Yeah.\n\n181\n00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,826\nMy, my example of that is matching\ndirectly with this laptop sitting in front\n\n182\n00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,890\nof me too.\n\n183\n00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,990\nThe very first day we get one and\nall of us are turning it on.\n\n184\n00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,615\nWe are so excited and I I look in\nthe corner of my screen and, and\n\n185\n00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:17,975\nit actually looks like a broken window\ndown in the corner of the screen.\n\n186\n00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,425\nNext time I bring it back I'm like,\nDonna, I think this has gotten bigger.\n\n187\n00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,325\nAnd Donna looks at it, it is bigger.\n\n188\n00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:23,145\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n189\n00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:25,590\nthroughout the week it\ncontinued to get worse.\n\n190\n00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,480\nSo, sometimes stuff happens,\nand regardless, right.\n\n191\n00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,005\nBecause you paid money for it,\n\n192\n00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:33,530\nyou want to make sure that you can\nget the best benefit out of that.\n\n193\n00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,490\nBut do check for\nphysical damage that, you know,\n\n194\n00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,710\nif you don't want to accept it when it\nfirst gets there, and it's damaged.\n\n195\n00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,430\nYou've got to be there to\ntell the shipping company,\n\n196\n00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,540\nyou're not going to accept it.\n\n197\n00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,780\nBut if you do get it,\nyou do have other recourses, and\n\n198\n00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,150\nwe'll talk about that in a little bit.\n\n199\n00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,200\n>> Yeah, so, you know, it,\nwhat, what do we do from there?\n\n200\n00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,640\nWell, like with your screen,\nyour screen was cracked.\n\n201\n00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> Got a brand new laptop,\n\n202\n00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,560\ntake it out of the box and\nthe screen is already cracked.\n\n203\n00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,320\nAnd so you've got to go and\nget assistance.\n\n204\n00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,820\nSo we'll talk about how to do that, but,\neven before then, if you've got a computer\n\n205\n00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,760\nthat's not powering on or it just doesn't\nseem to be working right, what are steps,\n\n206\n00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,840\nwhat are our steps as\nfar as getting recourse?\n\n207\n00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,080\nAnd And step number one is,\nbefore we panic,\n\n208\n00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,140\nbefore we start trying to\nfix the problem ourself, or\n\n209\n00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,885\nwhatever, it's usually a good\nidea to check the documentation.\n\n210\n00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:15,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n211\n00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,820\nIf you've purchased a laptop,\nor a desktop,\n\n212\n00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,235\nor individual components, each of\nthem will usually come with a manual.\n\n213\n00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:25,065\nThey, they may have it on a CD which\nI hate it when they do that if it's\n\n214\n00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,595\na computer and that's your only computer,\nyou might not be able to read it.\n\n215\n00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,075\nBut a lot of them will\ninclude a paper manual\n\n216\n00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:31,905\nthat will include basic\nquick configurations.\n\n217\n00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,220\nThe, you know, the steps you need to go\nthrough to get that system up and running.\n\n218\n00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,860\nAnd maybe that act computer has a slightly\ndifferent requirement then other systems\n\n219\n00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,820\nand you just missed\nsomething during the setup.\n\n220\n00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,130\nEasy to correct, and off you go, right.\n\n221\n00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,430\nSo check the documentation right, read\nthe manual and that's always good advice\n\n222\n00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,100\nin most situations even though a lot\nof us don't always follow that.\n\n223\n00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,780\n>> Yeah, around here when we first\ngot these laptops, particularly.\n\n224\n00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,200\nDon, I don't even think it took him three\nminutes before he had formatted the drive.\n\n225\n00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,770\nAnd had taken everything\noff there immediately.\n\n226\n00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,750\nWell, I was a little bit more cautious.\n\n227\n00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,690\nI, I let my system launch up, and that's\nwhere I found the documentation, Don.\n\n228\n00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,310\nIt was one of those, one of the tiles I\nhad in Windows 8 actually had the online\n\n229\n00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,230\nDell documentation and it was there,\nthat I was able to, to find out if there\n\n230\n00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,420\nwas a problem that this is where I needed\nto go and it gave me three options.\n\n231\n00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,362\nIt gave me the option of course to,\ncall them.\n\n232\n00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:29,066\nYou know to directly call them, or\nI could try and check the online help or\n\n233\n00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,603\nI could do a direct live chat.\n\n234\n00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:33,259\nSo, so it was through that\ndocumentation I found that out.\n\n235\n00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,940\nIf not, I probably would have just\nbeen sitting there just like,\n\n236\n00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,299\nwhy is my screen cracked and,\nand then finally calling.\n\n237\n00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:41,110\nI had, did call, it was, I think it was\nthe next day I actually called them and\n\n238\n00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,767\nI was able to get it,\nget something handled.\n\n239\n00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,869\n>> Yeah, they just, they just sent\nyou an all new laptop, too, right.\n\n240\n00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,517\n>> They sent me a brand spanking new\nlaptop, and it was funny because the,\n\n241\n00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,170\nthe tech support person was like,\n\n242\n00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,857\nokay,can you send me\na screenshot of what's going on?\n\n243\n00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,370\nI said, well,\nit's the physical screen that is broken.\n\n244\n00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,010\nHow do I send you a screenshot of that?\n\n245\n00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,670\nAnd so, I had to take a picture of it and\nI emailed him, and he said,\n\n246\n00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,760\nwell okay we can send somebody\nout to repair that and, but\n\n247\n00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,730\nthere was a little button,\nthe delete key, was popped up halfway.\n\n248\n00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,210\nAnd so I say, well,\nwhat about this to them, and\n\n249\n00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,850\nthey said, okay, never mind,\nwe're gonna send you a new laptop.\n\n250\n00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,430\nAnd so, so I was pretty cool with that,\nbut at the same time, you know,\n\n251\n00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,750\nit's nice to actually know that,\n\n252\n00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,970\nthat through that documentation\nit was very easy to get help.\n\n253\n00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,270\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n254\n00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,170\nSo, if we check the things\nthat we can fix on our own,\n\n255\n00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,590\nand it turns out to be one of those\nproblems, that's great, because now,\n\n256\n00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,220\nnow we don't have to do a warranty call,\nwe don't have to ship things back,\n\n257\n00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,870\nwe get to use the device\nwe purchased immediately.\n\n258\n00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,720\nBut if something is genuinely\nwrong with it, you shouldn't be\n\n259\n00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,300\nthe person stuck with it so we've got\nsome steps that we go through, right.\n\n260\n00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,790\nAnd the way that Comp TIA has them listed\nin the exam objectives is not really one\n\n261\n00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,045\nthat, that I like to follow,\nyou know the order they go in, but we'll,\n\n262\n00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:45,605\nwe'll stick to their order.\n\n263\n00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,275\nBut they basically start with\na manufacturer website, right?\n\n264\n00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,415\nAnd that is typically one of\nthe first places I'll go.\n\n265\n00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,188\nIn fact,\nI normally skip the documentation.\n\n266\n00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,405\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because whatever documentation you have\n\n267\n00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,020\nin hand is already out of date.\n\n268\n00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,570\nSo if you still have a,\nanother functional computer you can use,\n\n269\n00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,960\nyou can go to the vendor's website and\nget the most recent documentation.\n\n270\n00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,170\nRight?\nBut if this was your only computer and\n\n271\n00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,510\nyou can't get online, that physical\ndocumentation comes into play there.\n\n272\n00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,110\nSo you go to the vendor's website.\n\n273\n00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,920\nEvery major vendor that's out there\nhas a support area on their page.\n\n274\n00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,600\nAnd it is the best place\nto go to get information,\n\n275\n00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,370\ncuz you'll be able to do all\nsorts of things from there.\n\n276\n00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,740\nLet me show you an example here.\n\n277\n00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,520\nWe'll take let's do Dell and HP.\n\n278\n00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,030\nI think those are the two main\nsystem providers these days.\n\n279\n00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,290\nSo, if I go to Dell's webpage, it doesn't\nmatter if I'm dealing with a laptop, or\n\n280\n00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,920\na desktop, or printer,\nwhatever it is that I bought from Dell,\n\n281\n00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,530\nright here in the homepage, there's\na nice big support link right there.\n\n282\n00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,110\nAnd that's gonna take me to their support\nsystem, where you can pull up support by\n\n283\n00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,270\nproduct, by topic, your order,\nwarranty checks, and so on, right?\n\n284\n00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,800\nSo If I wanna go support by product,\nRonnie, you've got a, a Dell XPS 12,\n\n285\n00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,309\nright?\n\n286\n00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,917\n>> I do.\n>> So we can come in here and\n\n287\n00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,748\nthey're just letting me know\nthey've made some improvements, and\n\n288\n00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:57,526\nI can search by your serial number or\nI'm just gonna browse here, so\n\n289\n00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,440\nwe'll come in and\nsay that we've got a laptop.\n\n290\n00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,370\nAnd we'll say that we've got an XPS.\n\n291\n00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,480\nAnd it is an XPS 12.\n\n292\n00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,382\nNow there's two XPS 12s.\n\n293\n00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:08,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n294\n00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,830\nit's asking when you purchased it.\n\n295\n00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,376\nDid you purchase it in 2012 or 2013?\n\n296\n00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,698\nOurs [CROSSTALK]\n>> The early one.\n\n297\n00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:17,815\n>> So we'll choose that and\nonce we do that,\n\n298\n00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:20,670\nwe're now on the product support page for\nthat laptop.\n\n299\n00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,360\nNow, I,\nI had to remember when he bought that.\n\n300\n00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,150\nNow, we could have looked on his laptop,\nand gotten the serial number and\n\n301\n00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,680\nplugged in,\nthat would have avoided any doubt there.\n\n302\n00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,290\nBut, when we're here,\nnotice what they have, they have a,\n\n303\n00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,480\na quick test they can run for\ncommon problems.\n\n304\n00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,700\nSo if I'm actually on that XPS 12,\nit can scan it, and, and\n\n305\n00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,430\nidentify various issues\nthat I might be having.\n\n306\n00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,390\nBut there's support topics and\narticles right here.\n\n307\n00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,310\nAnd so we can go in and, and find various\ninformations, you'll see here like a mouse\n\n308\n00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,110\nkeyboard or touchpad not working, network\ncontroller troubleshooting and so on.\n\n309\n00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,100\nWalking through,\nthrough some of the different ways to\n\n310\n00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,800\nfind out what might be wrong or\ngood with that system.\n\n311\n00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,320\nThe original documentation,\nthe key of the laptop is right here,\n\n312\n00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,790\nthe getting started guide.\n\n313\n00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,320\nSo we can pull that up, here are the steps\nwe go through getting our system started\n\n314\n00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,300\nor, this is actually kind of\nleading us into the support setup.\n\n315\n00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,350\nBut basic information there,\nand drivers and\n\n316\n00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,980\nupdates, a lot of the stuff we\nneed right here, all right.\n\n317\n00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,668\nBut if you read that stuff and you don't\nfind the answer you're looking for,\n\n318\n00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:21,970\nif they don't directly address the problem\nthat you've got, well eventually this\n\n319\n00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,014\nthing creeps up out of the side of\nthe screen, which is just over here for\n\n320\n00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:29,750\ncontact and they got where we can chat,\nor call them, or email, for tech support.\n\n321\n00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,018\nAnd you might need to reach out to them.\n\n322\n00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:34,960\nNow Comp TIA, the way they list it,\nthey have the manufacturer's website and\n\n323\n00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,990\nthen there's two other things before\nthey get to contact technical support.\n\n324\n00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,950\nFor me, I normally check their website and\n\n325\n00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,630\nif I don't find what I want\nI then contact support.\n\n326\n00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,760\nI skip the next two steps\nbecause the next two steps\n\n327\n00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080\nlead to us dealing with idiots mostly.\n\n328\n00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,278\nSo I normally go from the website\nstraight to tech support.\n\n329\n00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,390\nAnd that doesn't mean that you wont\ndeal with an idiot there either but\n\n330\n00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,340\njust hopefully less likely.\n\n331\n00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,485\nSo that is kinda the normal\nprocess we go and and that's Dell.\n\n332\n00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,400\nLet's say it was HP right so\n\n333\n00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,052\nif we go to Hewlett Packard's website,\nyou'll see much the same.\n\n334\n00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:08,850\nAnd they, they structure these\nthe same on purpose to make it easy so\n\n335\n00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,110\nright here on HP's homepage I got support,\ndownload drivers, support and\n\n336\n00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,710\ntroubleshooting, and so on.\n\n337\n00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,790\nI'm gonna go to Support and\nTroubleshooting, and they're asking for\n\n338\n00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,690\nwhat my product is.\n\n339\n00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,070\nAnd I can punch in the name or\nserial number, if I've got it, or\n\n340\n00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,100\nif I'm on the device, it can\nautomatically detect what my system is.\n\n341\n00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,555\nSo I would come in here or just punch\nin whatever it is that I had you know,\n\n342\n00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:36,535\na ProBook 6470 and it'll go and\nfind the different ones.\n\n343\n00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,705\nThere's a base model,\n\n344\n00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,190\nsome kind of Energy Star rated one,\nand, and I don't know, something else.\n\n345\n00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,970\nSo, we'll say we have a base model,\nand we can go in and\n\n346\n00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,240\nit will have the same basic\ninformation that Dell had.\n\n347\n00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,465\nSo drivers and updates,\nguides, instructions,\n\n348\n00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,717\ntroubleshooting tips, and so on.\n\n349\n00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,152\nSo right here it takes me to my\ndownloads for software updates.\n\n350\n00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:58,415\nI've got top issues and solutions,\nthat's my troubleshooting.\n\n351\n00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,878\nAnd I've got my manual.\n\n352\n00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,589\nAnd if I have to do a warranty call,\nhere's the repair and\n\n353\n00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:05,699\nwarranty tab where it tells me how\nto contact customer support and\n\n354\n00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,810\ndo a warranty check to\nsee if it's covered.\n\n355\n00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,830\nNow if your device is brand new,\nit's still covered under a warranty and\n\n356\n00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,700\nthey will fix what's wrong with it.\n\n357\n00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,790\nBut if you've had your device for\n\n358\n00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,230\na few years it might not\nbe under warranty anymore.\n\n359\n00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,690\nAnd so that's why they have\nthis customer self-repair.\n\n360\n00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,720\nWays that you can buy parts and\ndo the repair on your own.\n\n361\n00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,610\nOr, you know, maybe reach out to someone\nelse to have them repair it, right?\n\n362\n00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,090\nEach vendor is like that.\n\n363\n00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,610\nYou just have to look for\nthat support link and you'll find it.\n\n364\n00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,100\n>> Yeah, I, I like the fact that you\nactually can pick what level of support\n\n365\n00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,610\n>> that you really want to be able to do.\n\n366\n00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,300\nIf you feel a little bit more hands on,\nyou may go ahead and\n\n367\n00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,340\ngive that a little bit more time and\neffort to do it.\n\n368\n00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,700\nBut if it gets beyond you,\nyes you can escalate that and\n\n369\n00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,840\nactually get more support.\n\n370\n00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,070\nThe one I ended up using\nwas an active chat\n\n371\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,756\n>> And that person was really fast and\n\n372\n00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:50,510\non the ball.\n\n373\n00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,410\nWithin fifteen minutes,\nI was told I'm getting a new laptop.\n\n374\n00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,290\nSo, yeah.\n\n375\n00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,300\nI liked that.\n\n376\n00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,150\n>> Just be careful with\nthe self-repair type stuff.\n\n377\n00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,510\nIf your device is under warranty and\n\n378\n00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,470\nyou do a self-repair,\nyou'll normally void the warranty.\n\n379\n00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,870\nSo, that's really designed for people that\nare outside of their warranty period.\n\n380\n00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,760\nAnd a lot of computers these days\nwill either come with a one year or\n\n381\n00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,310\na three year warranty.\n\n382\n00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,450\nYou're on a three year warranty and\nsomething breaks,\n\n383\n00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,020\neven if its within your power to fix it,\nyou still want to let them fix it so\n\n384\n00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,722\nthat your warranty will stay maintained.\n\n385\n00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,410\nAll right, so those are the two levels\nof support that I normally use,\n\n386\n00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,700\nbut CompTIA calls out two more, alright?\n\n387\n00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,930\nThey call out Technical community groups.\n\n388\n00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,010\nAll right, what,\nwhat are technical community groups?\n\n389\n00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,550\nWell, these are,\nare basically online forums, right?\n\n390\n00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,480\nAnd, you'll find a number of online\nforums that are out there where people\n\n391\n00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,250\npost problems they had and\nhow they fixed them.\n\n392\n00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,470\nAnd, some of them are even\nendorsed by the vendors.\n\n393\n00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,580\nSo, like, on Dell's website,\nif I were to go back,\n\n394\n00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,530\nif I could just,\nI've closed that page now.\n\n395\n00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,330\nBut if I were to go back far enough,\nmost of, of Dell's stuff,\n\n396\n00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,020\nwhen you're browsing around in there,\nthey will have where,\n\n397\n00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,620\nlet's see if we can find it,\n>> Off to the bottom.\n\n398\n00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,470\n>> So somewhere in here.\n\n399\n00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,190\n>> Scroll down, there it is.\n\n400\n00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,265\nJoin the community.\n\n401\n00:17:58,265 --> 00:17:58,925\nWhere is it at?\n\n402\n00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,395\nCommunity.\nHere we go, the Dell Community.\n\n403\n00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,135\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can go into this Dell Community and\n\n404\n00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,505\nthey have these discussion forums.\n\n405\n00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:07,855\nAnd other owners of XPS 12s,\nor whatever your device is,\n\n406\n00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:10,415\nwill start posting in there\nabout things they bumped into.\n\n407\n00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:13,732\nAnd You've gotta be really\ncareful in these places,\n\n408\n00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:17,142\nbecause some of the people know\nwhat they're talking about right?\n\n409\n00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,922\nBut most of them are just\naverage users and\n\n410\n00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:23,792\nsome of them will actually make\nsuggestions that are pretty bad.\n\n411\n00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,972\nAnd I can't tell you how many\ntimes I've gone through here and\n\n412\n00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:31,922\nread some advice from a person\nthat was just downright wrong and,\n\n413\n00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,462\nand you have to be really careful.\n\n414\n00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:36,920\nIf you have a software program that won't\nrun, I can guarantee it would only take\n\n415\n00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,450\nyou a few moments before you find somebody\nin a forum who's telling you oh, yeah.\n\n416\n00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,430\nIf you disable these security\nfeatures on your system\n\n417\n00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,400\nthe software will run just fine.\n\n418\n00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,510\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n419\n00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,560\nBut what they're not saying is oh,\nby the way.\n\n420\n00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,580\nYou're gonna weaken all\nthe security on your server.\n\n421\n00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,690\nI mean your, laptop or desktop.\n\n422\n00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,350\nIn order to get this,\nthis program running.\n\n423\n00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,190\nThey don't tell you that.\n\n424\n00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,360\nThey're just like,\nhere's what you have to do.\n\n425\n00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,540\nAnd, you have to be careful\nwho you trust with that stuff.\n\n426\n00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,750\nIt is not, not necessarily a safe,\nsafe haven of good information.\n\n427\n00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,900\nSo always take that with a grain of salt.\n\n428\n00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,300\nThe other thing is, they'll tell you\nfive different changes to make to fix\n\n429\n00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,410\nsomething, when in reality it might have\nbeen only one of things that fixed it.\n\n430\n00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,050\nAnd the others they just did and\ndon't know which one it was.\n\n431\n00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,940\nSo you're making unnecessary\nchanges to your system.\n\n432\n00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,930\nYou definitely want to\nbe careful with that.\n\n433\n00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,168\nSo some of the recommendations you find in\nhere, are just not, not necessarily good.\n\n434\n00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,250\nBut then you'lll see here,\n\n435\n00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,600\nany way to change the screen\nwithout voiding the warranty.\n\n436\n00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,880\nSo they want to just swap out\nthe display on the system.\n\n437\n00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,940\nWhich makes you wonder why they would do\nthat if it were still under warranty.\n\n438\n00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,750\nBut.\n>> Ha ha.\n\n439\n00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,740\n>> But anyhow.\nSo, so these are the kind of things,\n\n440\n00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,520\nyou gotta be careful with these forums.\n\n441\n00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,040\nAnd that leads us into\nthe kind of the related one,\n\n442\n00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,290\nwhich is the next one from CompTIA.\n\n443\n00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,140\nYep, internet search engine, right.\n\n444\n00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,320\n>> Yeah, internet search engine,\nI hate to say this,\n\n445\n00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,570\nis probably one of the first things that\nI end up doing the majority of the time.\n\n446\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,150\nBecause it really does give me the,\nthe most direct answer.\n\n447\n00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,410\nAnd a lot of times those search\nengines are pretty good where,\n\n448\n00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,430\nwhere the exact phrase that I'm looking\nfor it will bring that up top, first, but\n\n449\n00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,620\nit doesn't necessarily mean it's\ngonna give you the best answer again.\n\n450\n00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,270\nSo, the, the internet search forums I,\n\n451\n00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,865\nI probably go to that 90% more than\nI even go to the technical support.\n\n452\n00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, let's see what happens, right.\n\n453\n00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,150\nYou got a Dell XPS 12 so.\n\n454\n00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,830\n>> I do.\n\n455\n00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,530\n>> I'm going to go into,\nwe'll just go to Google.\n\n456\n00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,720\nI, I do, prefer Google over\nthe other search engines.\n\n457\n00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,850\nSo, I'll go to Google.\n\n458\n00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,320\nAnd I'm going to do a search for\nDell XPS 12 won't power on.\n\n459\n00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,870\nAll right?\n\n460\n00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,440\nSo, I can't get my laptop to power on and\nI do a search, and what do we find?\n\n461\n00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320\nWell, the first result\nactually comes from Dell.\n\n462\n00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,260\n>> The Dell online communities, right?\n\n463\n00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,050\nSo it is searching that content,\nand, and finding it.\n\n464\n00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,580\nNow, after that I start\nto see some other things,\n\n465\n00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,165\nlike, here's a review if I\nwas gonna buy a new XPS 12.\n\n466\n00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or,\n\n467\n00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,330\nhow to fix your Dell XPS 12 that\nwon't boot on ynmodel.com'.\n\n468\n00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,320\n>> Ha ha.\n>> Right.\n\n469\n00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,140\nNow, here's where we have to be careful.\n\n470\n00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've never heard of ymmodel.com.\n\n471\n00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,980\nI, I don't know what that site is.\n\n472\n00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,870\nThat could be one of the most well-known,\n\n473\n00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,470\nreliable authorities in\ncomputer repair in the world.\n\n474\n00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,110\nAll right?\n\n475\n00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,310\nBut I've never heard of them.\n\n476\n00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,255\nIt could be a malware site or\na pornography site for all I know.\n\n477\n00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:14,190\n>> Um-hm.\n>> You're ym model,\n\n478\n00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,250\nI'm not sure exactly what\nthat would stand for.\n\n479\n00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,330\nSo I don't know what that is.\n\n480\n00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,350\nAll right?\n\n481\n00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,270\nSo if you go to that page and\nthey tell you how to do something.\n\n482\n00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,810\nLet, let's take the risk here.\n\n483\n00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,350\nAnd they tell you how to do something,\n\n484\n00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,450\nhow do you know, whether these\nguys are a legitimate or not?\n\n485\n00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,600\nSo, don't just blindly follow the steps.\n\n486\n00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,440\nAnd the thing I always\nencourage people is read it\n\n487\n00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,690\nstart to finish before you do even\none single thing on your computer.\n\n488\n00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,800\nCuz you might find where the first\ncouple of steps make sense, and\n\n489\n00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,650\nthen at the end,\nthey tell you to do something ridiculous,\n\n490\n00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,460\nlike stick it in the refrigerator or\nsomething.\n\n491\n00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,570\nThat's a true story.\n\n492\n00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,500\nAnd, and so you see something ridiculous\nlike that and, and it's just yeah,\n\n493\n00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,320\nyou know, all this junk.\n\n494\n00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,150\nSo, these guys,\nlet's see what they're telling us.\n\n495\n00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,470\nIf our XPS12 won't start,\n\n496\n00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,930\nthey're saying, check to see how your\ncomputer acts when this happens.\n\n497\n00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,980\nOkay, so that's not good.\n\n498\n00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,590\nSo, this is our first indicator.\n\n499\n00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,740\nWhen they have a nonsensical step like\nthat, like if my computer won't boot,\n\n500\n00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,860\ncheck to see how your computer\nacts when this happens.\n\n501\n00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,190\nIt probably doesn't boot,\nthat's probably how it acts.\n\n502\n00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,370\nAnd then we move on,\nif it shows not signed.\n\n503\n00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,800\nOh, I guess English is\nnot their first language,\n\n504\n00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,660\nmaybe I shouldn't be so critical on it.\n\n505\n00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,505\nBut, if your fans don't run,\nsee if it's connected to power correctly.\n\n506\n00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:22,485\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's actually good advice.\n\n507\n00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:22,985\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n508\n00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,680\nThen, if,\nif it's connected to power correctly,\n\n509\n00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,710\nthen there is something wrong\nwith your power button.\n\n510\n00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,410\n>> Button.\nHa ha.\n\n511\n00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,780\n>> Well, that's absolutely,\nwell, it's possible.\n\n512\n00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,320\n>> Yes.\n>> All right,\n\n513\n00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,590\nit is possible that the power\nbutton may be a problem.\n\n514\n00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,090\nRight?\nYou're connected to power properly and\n\n515\n00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,080\nit won't turn on, but\nit could be other things.\n\n516\n00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,870\nI mean, you could have a bad motherboard.\n\n517\n00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,950\nAnd if you're probably plugged into power,\nit's not going to power on.\n\n518\n00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,000\nYour button might be fine.\n\n519\n00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000\nSo, this one's kind of jumping to\nconclusions very,very, quickly.\n\n520\n00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,930\nThat's where you have to be careful.\n\n521\n00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,730\nSo, that's where we really got to\nstart breaking these down, and\n\n522\n00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,890\njust look at what's being advised.\n\n523\n00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,350\nJust be careful, right.\n\n524\n00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,160\nThe people that are posting this stuff,\nyou don't know who they are.\n\n525\n00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,590\nYou don't know what level\nof experience they have.\n\n526\n00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,190\nYou don't know whether they've\nonly seen one of these laptops, or\n\n527\n00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,450\nwhether they've seen a bunch of them.\n\n528\n00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,560\nLike how many of these XPS 12s do we have\naround here, like ten of them, right?\n\n529\n00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n530\n00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,620\n>> So we've seen quite a few of them.\n\n531\n00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,290\nWe know about the problems,\nbut there's an XPS 13 out.\n\n532\n00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,560\nWe don't have a single one.\n\n533\n00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,850\nSo while we might know\na lot about this one model,\n\n534\n00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,400\nwe don't know anything about that other\nmodel, and that's how computers are.\n\n535\n00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,890\nThey vary from model to model.\n\n536\n00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,400\nThat's why you're always better off\ndealing with a vendor if you can.\n\n537\n00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,760\nCall their tech support number,\nand talk to them.\n\n538\n00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480\nOr read their documentation.\n\n539\n00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,400\nBut if they have community forums, or\nif you use a search engine to find it.\n\n540\n00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,620\nThat's kind of the wild west out there.\n\n541\n00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,680\nSo you just have make sure you read it,\nand make a judgement as to whether or\n\n542\n00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,025\nnot you think that person actually\nknows what they're talking about.\n\n543\n00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:48,450\n[LAUGH] I love it when they do this,\nthey say it's solved!\n\n544\n00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,790\nIt fixed whatever my problem was.\n\n545\n00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,323\nThis is another thing to look out for,\nsearch engines,\n\n546\n00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:59,451\nif I don't pay attention, here it actually\nfound how to fix a Dell XPSL501X.\n\n547\n00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,249\nIt's a different model number.\n\n548\n00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:05,266\nIt found that XPS 12 because it's\ntalking about some kind of 12 pin cable\n\n549\n00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,420\nhere, right?\n\n550\n00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,940\nSo if I go in this and start following\nthese snaps, it's not for my laptop,\n\n551\n00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,400\nit's for a different model.\n\n552\n00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,980\nSo you've gotta be careful there too.\n\n553\n00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:19,515\nAll right, so, in real life land,\nall of these are options, right?\n\n554\n00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:20,855\nYou just kind of pick and choose.\n\n555\n00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:24,235\nIn my opinion, you always start out\nby just verifying your cables and\n\n556\n00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:24,925\nconnectors, right?\n\n557\n00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,915\nMaking sure you put\neverything together right.\n\n558\n00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,995\nThen, you check your vendor documentation.\n\n559\n00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,405\nPhysical documentation if you have it, or\n\n560\n00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:34,825\nonline documentation on\nthe vendor's website if you don't.\n\n561\n00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:36,630\nAnd then, if you still haven't solved it.\n\n562\n00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,780\nYou go to tech support, right?\n\n563\n00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,660\nYou reach out to them,\ncall them on the phone, or whatever.\n\n564\n00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,400\nIf you're not under warranty,\na lot of times you can still call them and\n\n565\n00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,700\nthey'll still help you\ntroubleshoot on the phone.\n\n566\n00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,560\nIt's just if they do the repair,\nthey'll charge you, so\n\n567\n00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,680\nyou could help them, they could help you\nfind the problem and then you go and\n\n568\n00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,340\nbuy the part and\nrepair it yourself, if you want.\n\n569\n00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,880\nA lot of them will let\nyou do that just fine.\n\n570\n00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920\nThey don't get mad or anything.\n\n571\n00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,890\nBut the other option is you can go\nto their community forums, or search\n\n572\n00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,330\nthe Internet, look at other technical\ncommunity groups and see what's going on.\n\n573\n00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,580\nYou could even break down and\ntake it down to a store locally and\n\n574\n00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,880\nhave somebody else repair it, right.\n\n575\n00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,700\nI mean, there's a lot of local\ncomputer repair shops in most cities.\n\n576\n00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,810\nThey're not typically the least expensive,\nbut don't hold that against them.\n\n577\n00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,725\nRight?\n\n578\n00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In exchange for that higher price,\n\n579\n00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,490\nyou get a local company that's\navailable to fix your problem right now\n\n580\n00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,860\nversus shipping that computer off\nsomewhere else and having to wait days.\n\n581\n00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,420\nRight?\n\n582\n00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420\nCosts a lot of money to\nrun your own business and\n\n583\n00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,720\nso they do have to charge\na little more for it.\n\n584\n00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,960\nIt's it's not it's not\nan enviable position to be in.\n\n585\n00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,690\n>> No.\n>> It's hard to, hard to\n\n586\n00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,820\nrun a business these days.\n\n587\n00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,770\n>> Yep.\n>> So.\n\n588\n00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,035\nAll right.\nBut but that's probably about it for\n\n589\n00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:42,715\nyour basic support steps, right?\n\n590\n00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,885\nIt's not anything too, too terribly crazy.\n\n591\n00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:47,915\n>> Yeah, just remember,\na lot of it's logical so\n\n592\n00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,225\nif you follow just kind of your basic,\nyou know,\n\n593\n00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:54,705\nintuition on how some of this stuff\nis gonna be done, you should be fine.\n\n594\n00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,305\nJust don't let it do like it does\nme sometimes where you're like,\n\n595\n00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,825\nI can't believe this much\nnow this thing doesn't work.\n\n596\n00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,520\nAnd you let your, for me is, is anger.\n\n597\n00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,800\nI, I just get angry-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n598\n00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,660\n>> That it's not working, and\n\n599\n00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,228\nthat sometimes blinds me to steps I can\neasy follow and get it taken care of.\n\n600\n00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:12,230\n>> You know, and nobody wants to get\nsomething new and not be able to use it.\n\n601\n00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n602\n00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,620\nI got a new computer,\nI wanna see what it can do.\n\n603\n00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n604\n00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,620\n>> Won't even work or\n\n605\n00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,430\nit's got a cracked screen, and\nthat stuff's really frustrating.\n\n606\n00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,500\nSo, yeah, you definitely don't wanna\nput up with that if you don't have to.\n\n607\n00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,160\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat pretty much wraps up our basic\n\n608\n00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,450\ntroubleshooting steps right there, so\nthis is a good point for us to stop.\n\n609\n00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,470\nWe do still have a couple more topics that\nwe need to get to for basic IT literacy.\n\n610\n00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,060\nSo stay turned,\nwe've got more content coming up.\n\n611\n00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,860\nBut for right now,\nwell let's wrap this turkey up.\n\n612\n00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,760\nRemember if you have any questions,\nplease feel free to ask.\n\n613\n00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,620\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to http://www.itpro.tv/live.\n\n614\n00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,730\nYou'll see that chat box\nthere below the video.\n\n615\n00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,370\nPost your questions there,\nwe monitor and

--> 00:00:38,271\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,060\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,170\nBack again here with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,140\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,950\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,430\nWe have another beautiful\nday here in Florida, and\n\n9\n00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,700\nwe are still doing IT fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,974\nBut, I need to actually get pretty\nclose to, to back up my laptop,\n\n11\n00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:54,433\nbecause it's probably been almost a year,\nDon.\n\n12\n00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,270\n>> Since you backed up your laptop?\n\n13\n00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,570\n>> Since I backed up my laptop.\n\n14\n00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,870\n>> Well, this is the episode for you.\n\n15\n00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,140\nWe are continuing on with\nCompTIA IT fundamentals.\n\n16\n00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,500\nOur major objective is 5.0,\nbasic IT literacy.\n\n17\n00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,350\nBut in this episode, we're jumping\nstraight to 5.4 explain basic\n\n18\n00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,951\nbackup concepts and backing up of\nour data is something that a lot of\n\n19\n00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,337\npeople don't think about\nuntil it's too late.\n\n20\n00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,297\nNow, what are we talking about when\nwe talk about backing things up?\n\n21\n00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:24,210\nWell, you have a lot of\ninformation on your computer.\n\n22\n00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,020\nYou have emails that you've written,\nand files that you've created,\n\n23\n00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,900\ndocuments that you save,\nmaybe tax paperwork you filled out, or\n\n24\n00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,090\nwhatever, and all of that gets stored\non the hard drive in your computer.\n\n25\n00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,370\nUnfortunately, hard drives\ndon't last forever.\n\n26\n00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,380\nIf it's a mechanical hard drive, one\nthat has spinning platters inside of it,\n\n27\n00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,250\nit's probably only rated for\nabout three years.\n\n28\n00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,880\nLook at the warranty of your hard\ndrive when you buy it or, you know,\n\n29\n00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,170\nthe warranty of your computer.\n\n30\n00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,660\nIf your hard drive only comes with a one\nyear warranty, that means after year one,\n\n31\n00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,430\nthe hardware manufacturer no longer\ntrusts that drive to survive.\n\n32\n00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,902\nAnd if it comes with a three\nyear warranty, same thing, but\n\n33\n00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,320\njust three years out.\n\n34\n00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,510\nSo, if you're beyond that period,\n\n35\n00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,410\nit's pretty safe to say your\ndrive could fail at any moment.\n\n36\n00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,350\nBut, even if it's before,\nwhen you have a moving piece,\n\n37\n00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,560\nany kind of equipment that\nhas a moving part can fail.\n\n38\n00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,260\nIt doesn't necessarily\nlast the whole time.\n\n39\n00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,050\nAnd, you never want to have yourself in\na position where you lose that drive.\n\n40\n00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,400\nAnd you lose things that\nwere important to you.\n\n41\n00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,730\nBecause, there are some\nthings we can't recreate.\n\n42\n00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,780\nAnd that is a, a real,\nreal, just, travesty.\n\n43\n00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,610\nI mean it can be, it can be sickening.\n\n44\n00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,840\nHave you ever had that, Ronnie?\n\n45\n00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,690\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Where you lost data and?\n\n46\n00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,630\n>> Oh yeah.\nThere's, even do this day, when I\n\n47\n00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,200\nend up moving, cause I've moved from\nGeorgia to Tennessee to North Carolina and\n\n48\n00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,860\nSouth Carolina to Florida and\nback to Florida again before.\n\n49\n00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,490\nI still have a hard drive that I swear\nhas data on it, that, that I can't find.\n\n50\n00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,260\nSo, there's a couple of different hard\ndrives that have gone missing and\n\n51\n00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,520\nI wish I had a backup somewhere\nof that information that I could\n\n52\n00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,970\nhave gotten access to when I needed,\nand I don't.\n\n53\n00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,450\nBackups are the only real way that we can\nensure that we're not going to lose data.\n\n54\n00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,030\nDoing it like I did just once\na year is probably not enough, yup.\n\n55\n00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,730\n>> Yeah and it,\nit's when that drive fails, you know,\n\n56\n00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,760\nwhen you look at it [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's sickening.\n\n57\n00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,294\n>> And you're like man, my.\n\n58\n00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was my family photos.\n\n59\n00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or whatever.\n\n60\n00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,740\nYou get this, this sinking feeling\n>> Yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,720\n>> In your gut, it's terrible.\n\n62\n00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,132\nYou don't want that to happen.\n\n63\n00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:19,550\nI, I, I started out in computers\ndoing warranty repairs for people.\n\n64\n00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,530\nI replaced a lot of hard drives in my day.\n\n65\n00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,480\nAnd we used to get people that were\nlike PhD Students, or, you know,\n\n66\n00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,440\ndoctorial students at a college.\n\n67\n00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,920\nAnd, they'd have their, their dissertation\non there they'd been working on for years,\n\n68\n00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,210\nand, and it's gone.\n\n69\n00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,590\nAnd and they'd say well is there\nsomeway you can get it off the drive,\n\n70\n00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,480\nand usually you can't.\n\n71\n00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,020\n>> Right.\nSometimes there's ways you can get\n\n72\n00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,940\nthe data off there, but most of the times,\nyou can't, the data's just gone.\n\n73\n00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,575\nNow, if they had a good\nbackup with their system,\n\n74\n00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,440\nthen they wouldn't be sweating it at all.\n\n75\n00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480\nHey, my drive failed.\n\n76\n00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,390\nThat sucks, but,\nI got my data over here too, so I'm okay.\n\n77\n00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,720\nI've got my information.\n\n78\n00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,300\nRight?\n\n79\n00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,740\nAnd so this is something\nthat we can't stress enough.\n\n80\n00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,700\nYou should never have just\none copy of your data.\n\n81\n00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,630\nYou should always have\nat least two copies, so\n\n82\n00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,740\nthat you can recover in\nthe event of a failure.\n\n83\n00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,360\nDo not trust your hard drive,\nhard drives fail.\n\n84\n00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,940\nEven if you have the solid state drives,\nthey're actually a little worse.\n\n85\n00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,710\nThey can fail before\na physical hard drive, and\n\n86\n00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,410\nusually give you very little warning.\n\n87\n00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,390\nSo, we definitely want\nto back those things up.\n\n88\n00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,070\nFortunately, in today's world, we have\na lot of choices that are out there, and\n\n89\n00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,710\nwe'll take a look at some of\nthe different methods that we can use.\n\n90\n00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,820\nAnd Marvin, in the chat room,\n\n91\n00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,280\nactually asked a question here just\na minute ago about when he does a backup.\n\n92\n00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,810\nMaking sure that he doesn't get just\nwhat's done right now versus what he\n\n93\n00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,770\nmight have done in the past.\n\n94\n00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,530\nNow, I'll, I'll talk about that too,\nhere, in just a minute.\n\n95\n00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,682\nSome of the, some of the solutions we\nhave can take care of that same problem.\n\n96\n00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:42,140\nAll right, so, let's start with\njust a couple of things, right?\n\n97\n00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,390\nWe know what a backup is.\n\n98\n00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,759\nBackup is just a second copy of our data,\nright?\n\n99\n00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,580\nSo, one of the decisions we have to\nmake is when to do those backups,\n\n100\n00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,130\nhow often we should do the backups.\n\n101\n00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,770\nAnd then when we schedule them, right?\n\n102\n00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,200\nSo, Ronnie, what, what do you,\nwhat's your opinion on this one?\n\n103\n00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,980\n>> The more often,\n\n104\n00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,310\nthe better, but normally what ends\nup happening is that I forget.\n\n105\n00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,740\nSo even though I have a good intention\nof backing up weekly, I realize\n\n106\n00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,810\nthat after a time, it's usually been\na month before I've backed up anything.\n\n107\n00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,833\nAnd then sometimes we're really busy,\n\n108\n00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,580\nit may be two months\nbefore I back up anything.\n\n109\n00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,570\nAnd by that point,\nmy computer's changed so rapidly.\n\n110\n00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,770\nStuff I've deleted.\n\n111\n00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,050\nStuff that's gone.\n\n112\n00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,500\nStuff that have changed is now, not there.\n\n113\n00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,230\nAnd so yeah, things can change rapidly.\n\n114\n00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,050\n>> Now, the amount of time between backups\nis going to vary between person to person.\n\n115\n00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,870\nAll right?\n\n116\n00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,240\nThe time between backups,\nis basically a statement from you saying,\n\n117\n00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,740\nthis is the amount of data\nI can afford to lose.\n\n118\n00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,480\nLet's say that we back up once a week.\n\n119\n00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,310\nSo I'm going to back up\nmy computer every Sunday.\n\n120\n00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,040\nSo every Sunday,\nI'm going to back up my whole computer.\n\n121\n00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,550\nWell, If I have a failure, I can just go\nget my backup from the last Sunday and\n\n122\n00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,460\nI'm back in business, right?\n\n123\n00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,830\nBut what if today is Friday?\n\n124\n00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,250\nIf today is Friday and\nI have a failure, I haven't\n\n125\n00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,590\nbacked up all the work that I did on\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n126\n00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,440\nIf I go back to last Sunday,\nI loose everything since then, and\n\n127\n00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,760\nso, if that was a lot of work.\n\n128\n00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,600\nIf I put a lot of effort in that,\nlike if I lost my show notes for\n\n129\n00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,620\nthose days, I would be so frustrated.\n\n130\n00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,060\nI can't afford to lose\nmultiply days worth of work.\n\n131\n00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,390\nIf I lost one day of work, I'd be okay,\nI could, I could redo that, I'd,\n\n132\n00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,100\nI'd be able to cope with that, but\nI can't lose a week's work, I, I can't,\n\n133\n00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,060\nit's just too much.\n\n134\n00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,370\nRight, so for me,\na weekly backup is not acceptable.\n\n135\n00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,196\nA monthly backup is unconscionable for\nme, right?\n\n136\n00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but a, a weekly is,\n\n137\n00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,110\nis really not possible either.\n\n138\n00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,090\nSo for me, I need a daily backup,\n\n139\n00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,850\nI need a backup every single daily\nat a minimum if not more frequently.\n\n140\n00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,470\nIf you're something like a stock exchange,\nwhere you're processing stock purchases.\n\n141\n00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,420\nYou can't afford to lose any data\n>> Yeah.\n\n142\n00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,020\n>> Right?\nSo even going a single day would be too\n\n143\n00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,000\ncrazy to try and rebuild all the financial\ntransactions you did in that day.\n\n144\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,010\nSo for companies,\nthey may backup very, very frequently.\n\n145\n00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,780\nFor us though, we may back our personal\nstuff up much less frequently.\n\n146\n00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,540\nAnd I,\nI personally do a backup every single day.\n\n147\n00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,710\nBut you know,\ndifferent people have different methods.\n\n148\n00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,130\nAnd, Ronnie, you mentioned like,\nyou forget, right?\n\n149\n00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,850\n>> Yes.\n>> So you,\n\n150\n00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,640\nyou do a manual backup on your system,\nright?\n\n151\n00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,550\n>> I do.\nYeah, and\n\n152\n00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,130\nthe reason why I do a manual backup,\nI don't know why, I just like to do it.\n\n153\n00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,590\nI like to see it start,\nI like to see it finish.\n\n154\n00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,270\nAnd so, normally,\nwhen I have everything ready to go, I,\n\n155\n00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,340\nI want to go ahead and do that.\n\n156\n00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,830\nBut there are times I forget.\n\n157\n00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,297\nI always back up this little terabyte\nhard drive that I have USB, and\n\n158\n00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:36,270\nsometimes I leave\nthe terabyte hard drive here.\n\n159\n00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,740\nSometimes I leave it at home.\n\n160\n00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,930\nSometimes it's just not\nwhere I need it and so\n\n161\n00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,960\nthat's why I always end up forgetting.\n\n162\n00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,436\n>> And most of the backup solutions\nthat you choose do have an option,\n\n163\n00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:51,130\ndo an automatic backup, but they will\nask you for a schedule, typically,\n\n164\n00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,470\nbecause here's the thing.\n\n165\n00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,459\nA lot of us like to schedule the backups\nin the middle of the night when we're\n\n166\n00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,793\nnot using the computer, right?\n\n167\n00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,950\nBacking up your computer can\ntake a lot of resources.\n\n168\n00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,350\nIt has to read all your data and\nback that up So,\n\n169\n00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,000\nyou probably don't want to do that\nwhile you're using the computer.\n\n170\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,500\nSo, if we can schedule it for the middle\nof the night, I'm not using the computer.\n\n171\n00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,832\nIt'll run the backup and\nit'll be perfect, and it will do it so\n\n172\n00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:13,170\nI don't have to worry about me forgetting.\n\n173\n00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,815\nBut what if I turn my\ncomputer off at night?\n\n174\n00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now it's not so viable.\n\n175\n00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,120\nThe computer's not on.\n\n176\n00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,450\nIt can't run a backup\nif you're powered off.\n\n177\n00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,940\nSo, we need to schedule the backups to\noccur at a time when we know the computer\n\n178\n00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,170\nwill be on.\n\n179\n00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,230\nAnd it is a good idea to do\nautomatic scheduling on it.\n\n180\n00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,570\nI know that's how I have my laptop set up,\nso that it'll do backups\n\n181\n00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,910\njust when it's on and and\nI actually don't have a time set on mine.\n\n182\n00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,430\nI have mine just set to do a backup once\na day whenever it's powered on, right?\n\n183\n00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,510\nSo, it'll actually do backups while\nI'm using the laptop and, and\n\n184\n00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,640\nthat's kind of a nice thing if you're\njust wanting to guarantee a backup.\n\n185\n00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,230\nI'm willing to give up a little\nperformance in exchange for\n\n186\n00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,800\nknowing that my data has been duplicated.\n\n187\n00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,030\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,850\nSo, as far as scheduling and frequency,\nthat will vary from person to person, but\n\n189\n00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,330\nthese are the things we need to,\nto take into account.\n\n190\n00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,550\nThe other thing we need to\nconsider when we backup is,\n\n191\n00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,350\nwhat are we backing our data up to?\n\n192\n00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,710\nWhere, where are we copying it?\n\n193\n00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,395\nCuz you can make some\nreally bad decisions.\n\n194\n00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I remember helping one [LAUGH] person\n\n195\n00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,230\nwhere they had all their documents\nstored in a folder on their hard drive.\n\n196\n00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,480\nAnd, so they wanted to make a backup,\nand, so\n\n197\n00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,700\nthey copied it to a second\nfolder on their hard drive.\n\n198\n00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,960\nSo they had their data stored in two\ndifferent folders on their hard drive.\n\n199\n00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,970\nWell the problem with that solution\nis if your hard drive fails,\n\n200\n00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,650\nyou lose both folders, right?\n\n201\n00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,840\nSo, we need to get\nthe data somewhere else.\n\n202\n00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,090\nAt least on a second hard\ndrive in the same computer but\n\n203\n00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,840\neven better,\nsomewhere else entirely, right?\n\n204\n00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,010\nThe further away from our computer we can\nget that backup, the better off we'll be.\n\n205\n00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,670\n>> You know, Don, I remember\na situation in which somebody said I\n\n206\n00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,520\nalways backup my data\nto a second hard drive.\n\n207\n00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,030\nAnd when I, when I inspected it,\nand I looked at it.\n\n208\n00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,890\nWhat they were actually really backing up\nto was just the second partition on that\n\n209\n00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,160\nsame hard drive.\n\n210\n00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,310\nAnd the disk itself had failed.\n\n211\n00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,390\nSo when I opened up the physical computer,\nI said, there is no second hard drive.\n\n212\n00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,520\nAnd sh, and she said, well, no,\nI always backup from drive C to drive E.\n\n213\n00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,320\nAnd that's whe, when I had to tell her,\nI was like th, the disk itself is gone.\n\n214\n00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,320\nSo remember, it's not just about moving\nfrom one partition to another one.\n\n215\n00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,190\nYou make sure that there's actually\nanother drive in there at the least and\n\n216\n00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,500\nlike Don said, the further removed it is,\nthe better it's gonna be.\n\n217\n00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n218\n00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,510\nSo CompTIA lists three\npossible destinations, and\n\n219\n00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,300\nthe first one they mention is what's\ncalled locally attached storage.\n\n220\n00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,990\nAnd what locally attached storage\nmeans is having a second hard drive\n\n221\n00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,860\non your computer.\n\n222\n00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,600\nSo you've got one hard drive and\nthat's got your data,\n\n223\n00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,560\nand you have a second hard drive and\nyou backup to it.\n\n224\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,130\nIf your primary hard drive were to fail,\n\n225\n00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,820\nyou've still got your backup\nwith your data there.\n\n226\n00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,110\nThe only negative is if\nthey're in the same computer,\n\n227\n00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,070\nwhat happens if something catastrophic\nhappens to the computer itself, right?\n\n228\n00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,340\nLike maybe your, your house burns down.\n\n229\n00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,570\nWell I had two drives in there.\n\n230\n00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,663\nI was backing up my stuff,\nbut the house burned down.\n\n231\n00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:50,777\nI lost both drives.\n\n232\n00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:51,798\nNow, a house burning\n\n233\n00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,811\ndown is already a pretty tragic-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:56,370\n>> Or, or you know, traumatic experience.\n\n235\n00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,060\nLosing your data on top of that,\nI mean, it's just, it's bad.\n\n236\n00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,250\nSo, if we had some way to have that data\nbacked up not inside of our computer,\n\n237\n00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,220\nthat would be even better, right?\n\n238\n00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,342\nAnd so that's where we start to see some\nof the other options that CompTIA lists.\n\n239\n00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:14,260\nThe the next one they list is a offsite or\ncloud-based backup.\n\n240\n00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,330\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n241\n00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,080\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent companies out there that,\n\n242\n00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,260\nthat make their business on the internet,\nproviding storage for you and me.\n\n243\n00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,290\nAnd what you can do is, you can go\nto those different websites, and\n\n244\n00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,486\nyou can tell them that you want to\nbackup to their storage instead, and\n\n245\n00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,680\nit will do it across\nyour internet connection.\n\n246\n00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,420\nSo that way, the nice thing about\nthat is you're no longer depending\n\n247\n00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,370\non a physical drive inside\nof your own computer.\n\n248\n00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,892\nBut you're just dependent upon\nthat internet connection, and\n\n249\n00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:43,920\nthe, the the provider's a storage\nyou know, wherever they are.\n\n250\n00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,195\nAnd usually, they have redundancy, which\nmeans that, that they're not gonna allow\n\n251\n00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:50,150\ntheirs to fail without there, actually,\nalso being a backup for that.\n\n252\n00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n253\n00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,850\nAnd you know, some of the big\nproviders that are out there,\n\n254\n00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,010\nlet me just show you guys a, a couple\nof them, so you're familiar with them.\n\n255\n00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,530\nObviously, this part won't be on the exam,\n\n256\n00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,880\nbut there's companies like\nCrashPlan CrashPlan is from a company.\n\n257\n00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,110\nThe company is actually called Code 42.\n\n258\n00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,430\nCrashPlan is their product and\nyou basically pay a monthly fee for them.\n\n259\n00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,715\nThey're not terribly expensive and\nyou run a little program on your computer.\n\n260\n00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:15,315\nAnd it will back up all of your data\nto their data center out in the cloud,\n\n261\n00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,755\nout on the internet, right?\n\n262\n00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,405\nAnd the idea is that,\nif your hard drive fails, or\n\n263\n00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,370\nif your computer gets stolen or your\nhouse burns down, if you lose everything.\n\n264\n00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,280\nAll of your data is backed up at their\ncenter so you can always just go and\n\n265\n00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160\nretrieve it.\n\n266\n00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,570\nIt's safe and it's offsite.\n\n267\n00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,215\nThe site, that's your house,\nright, or, or your office.\n\n268\n00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:35,460\nOffsite means somewhere else,\nexternally, right?\n\n269\n00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,300\nThere's also companies like Carbonite,\nwhich provide, effectively,\n\n270\n00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,860\nthe same product, right?\n\n271\n00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,190\nSo, you know, they have that same thing,\n\n272\n00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,000\nyou run a little client on your\nmachine and they backup to it.\n\n273\n00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360\nIt works really well.\n\n274\n00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,450\nThere's other services like\nDropbox is another one and,\n\n275\n00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,010\nand I actually use Dropbox for\nsome things.\n\n276\n00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,450\nDropbox is a pretty big one that gives you\nsome storage out there on the internet\n\n277\n00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,420\nthe thing to remember with these guys is,\nMarvin's question in the chat room, right?\n\n278\n00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,600\nThis is where I wanted to answer this one.\n\n279\n00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,540\nMarvin mentioned that he, he uses a,\na local storage device on his system,\n\n280\n00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,260\nwhere he's able to backup to it,\njust like CrashPlan or, or Carbonite.\n\n281\n00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,820\nAnd, one of the problems\nyou bump into with these is\n\n282\n00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,370\nsome of them will only maintain\nyour current copy of the data.\n\n283\n00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,820\nRight, so it's backing things\nup as your work with it.\n\n284\n00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,464\nIf I had a document and\nI go in and I add some text to it,\n\n285\n00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,369\nit is going to back that up and\nhave it stored in the cloud.\n\n286\n00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:32,730\nBut, what if I want an older\nversion of the document?\n\n287\n00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,340\nWhat if I want to see what the document\nlooked like two time, two changes before?\n\n288\n00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,390\nOr, what if I delete the document,\n\n289\n00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,270\nwell if I delete it, it's going to go out\nto the cloud and delete it there too,\n\n290\n00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,230\nright, cuz they, they synced, and\nso I'm going to lose that document.\n\n291\n00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,800\nWhat if I want retrieve\nsomething that I deleted,\n\n292\n00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,580\nwell a lot of them don't support that.\n\n293\n00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,350\nThey say, we're just gonna\nmaintain your current set of data.\n\n294\n00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,690\nBut, others will do\nwhat's called versioning.\n\n295\n00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,291\nSo, they might call it versioning or\nthey might call it differentials.\n\n296\n00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,859\nThere's a few different names for it.\n\n297\n00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,766\nBut it all basically boils down\nto the same thing, is that,\n\n298\n00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:07,093\nthey don't just backup\nyour whole set of data,\n\n299\n00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:11,010\nbut they also backup what's changed, so\nthat you can actually go back in time.\n\n300\n00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,830\nSo you don't have to necessarily just have\nto be able to restore what you have now,\n\n301\n00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,340\nbut you can start stepping back.\n\n302\n00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,510\nAnd so, if we take a service like\nDropbox here, let's take Dropbox.\n\n303\n00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,110\nAnd you'll see where we can sign up, and\nthey get all their various information.\n\n304\n00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,040\nLet me just go to their pricing page.\n\n305\n00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,040\nWhen you use Dropbox,\nyou run a little agent on your computer.\n\n306\n00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,320\nAnd, you put your data in\nthat folder that they have.\n\n307\n00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670\nIt creates a Dropbox folder.\n\n308\n00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,360\nAnd, anything that you put in that\nfolder will be on your computer and\n\n309\n00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,478\ncopied up to their service.\n\n310\n00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:40,710\nAnd, so they've got it online and\nlocally and you'll see for $10 a month,\n\n311\n00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,750\nyou get a terrabyte of storage and\nso they'll back that up, right?\n\n312\n00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,220\nNow, that works pretty well, but it is\njust showing what you've currently got.\n\n313\n00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,410\nAnd, when you go to upgrade,\nsomewhere in here it will tell us,\n\n314\n00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,470\nthat you can actually\npay a little bit extra.\n\n315\n00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,172\nWhere is the option?\n\n316\n00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:59,655\nSomewhere in here it'll tell me,\nthat you can pay a little bit extra and\n\n317\n00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,885\nyou can get versioning.\n\n318\n00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:03,226\nDid they-\n>> Over on Dropbox for business,\n\n319\n00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:03,950\nit looks like.\n\n320\n00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,850\n>> Is it on this one?\n\n321\n00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,250\n>> I think so, it says sent,\nunlimited version history.\n\n322\n00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,980\nWell that, so it definitely comes with it.\n\n323\n00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,570\n>> Oh.\n>> So on the personal side they\n\n324\n00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,060\nactually have where you can pay\njust a little more to get it, too.\n\n325\n00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,730\nBut here they say that unlimited version\nhistory, and that's where they're saying,\n\n326\n00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,690\nif you change a document, yeah, we'll\nback up the new one with the changes.\n\n327\n00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,430\nBut we're gonna keep the old one too,\nthat doesn't have the changes, and\n\n328\n00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,050\nthat way you can go back and\nget to it if you need to, right?\n\n329\n00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,530\nThat happens, sometimes you need\nto see what a document looked like\n\n330\n00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,270\nbefore cuz maybe you accidentally damaged\nit now and that's been backed up, right?\n\n331\n00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,140\nNot every system supports that or\nit might even be an option.\n\n332\n00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,351\nSo Marvin, in your case,\n\n333\n00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:44,500\nI haven't used that particular\ndrive that you're talking about.\n\n334\n00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,875\nSo there might be a feature in there that\nyou can enable for that, it might not.\n\n335\n00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,680\nOn Carbonite which I know you actually\nspecifically mention Carbonite, for them,\n\n336\n00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,958\nthey might actually have that\nin part of their pricing plan.\n\n337\n00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,700\nThey might be able to do that,\n\n338\n00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,369\nI, I'm not sure I haven't dealt with\nthem but a lot of them will have that,\n\n339\n00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:07,000\nwhere you can go in and pay a little\nbit extra to get the previous versions.\n\n340\n00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,360\nYou know, that historic data to pull back.\n\n341\n00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,085\nSo and here it's just saying\nthat it does that live sync.\n\n342\n00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:16,055\nSo Carbonite, that might be a way\nthat they keep their costs lower.\n\n343\n00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:18,645\nYeah I don't see one that's listed there.\n\n344\n00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,175\n>> Yeah.\n\n345\n00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:20,935\n>> So, just be on the lookout for\n\n346\n00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,860\nthat when you choose that if you need\nthose past versions, of a document.\n\n347\n00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,990\nIt might not be able to override so,\nso keep that in mind also,\n\n348\n00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,160\nthere might be technologies in your\nown operating system that can do it.\n\n349\n00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,330\nWindows has something called volume\nshadow copy that you can enable that,\n\n350\n00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,070\nit won't protect you from\na hard drive failure but\n\n351\n00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,930\nit will let you get to previous\nversions of your documents.\n\n352\n00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,000\nIf you have that combined with Carbonite\nthen, then you're kind of safe.\n\n353\n00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,030\nOn the Mac side you have,\nTime Machine, right,\n\n354\n00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,090\nTime Machine won't send your backup out\nto the cloud, but it will save multiple\n\n355\n00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,570\nversions right here on your own system,\nand it can do it to an external drive.\n\n356\n00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,340\nSo your operating system may have\nsomething built in that provides that\n\n357\n00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,630\nfunctionality too all right, so those are\na couple of providers for offsite backup.\n\n358\n00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,150\nIf you're in an enterprise environment,\n\n359\n00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,870\nthen you might actually have\na little bit of a problem here.\n\n360\n00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,560\nWhen we back up all of\nour data to Carbonite, or\n\n361\n00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,950\nwe back it all up to Dropbox or\nCrash Plan or whoever, right?\n\n362\n00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,315\nYou're basically saying,\nI trust those guys-\n\n363\n00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:16,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,410\n>> To hold my data.\n\n365\n00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,110\nOkay?\n\n366\n00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,830\nWell, my wife and I had a conversation\nabout this the other day she said, well,\n\n367\n00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,880\nwhy, why wouldn't I trust them you know,\nthat,\n\n368\n00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,810\nthat's what they do for\na living and, I said, well, okay.\n\n369\n00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,680\nHow about this?\n\n370\n00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,870\nCan you name me one employee at Dropbox?\n\n371\n00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,760\nJust a name, give me, give me\nthe name of one employee at Dropbox.\n\n372\n00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280\nI don't know one I've used Dropbox for\nyears I have no idea so\n\n373\n00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,610\nwhy would I trust somebody when I don't\neven know what their name is, right?\n\n374\n00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,440\nThat's what we have to remember you\ndon't know who those employees are and\n\n375\n00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,330\nwhile they tell you, yeah,\nwe do the utmost highest security,\n\n376\n00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,590\nwhatever, things can happen, right.\n\n377\n00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,770\nThey're a big company flaws can happen\npeople can, can do crazy things so,\n\n378\n00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,030\nif you're in a corporate environment or\nyou're dealing with medical records, or\n\n379\n00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,780\nfinancial, you might not be allowed to\nuse those there might be government\n\n380\n00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,890\nregulations that say you can't\nuse shared storage like that.\n\n381\n00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,580\nIn which case you've gotta find a way\nto get your data offsite without\n\n382\n00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,322\nusing a third party provider.\n\n383\n00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,670\nAll right, so for a lot of companies they\nwon't use a cloud provider like this, but\n\n384\n00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,850\ninstead we'll use LTO tape drives,\nall right.\n\n385\n00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,230\nMost people will never touch a tape,\na magnetic tape,\n\n386\n00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,810\non computers anymore we remember the real,\nthe real machines from the 1970s or\n\n387\n00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,920\n60s, or even the cassette tapes\nthat were used in the 80s.\n\n388\n00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,760\nBut why do we still have tapes?\n\n389\n00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,270\nWe'll, they're high capacity they\nget through a lot of data, and\n\n390\n00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,850\nthey can take a beating you can pop\na tape in the back of your data.\n\n391\n00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,660\nPop the tape out and\n\n392\n00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,170\ntake it somewhere else you can\nphysically take it where ever you want.\n\n393\n00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,290\nYou can do that with a hard drive, but\n\n394\n00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,650\nhard drives aren't really\ndesigned to be portable.\n\n395\n00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,470\nIf you drop a hard drive from two,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,516\n>> In the air just about,\n\n397\n00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:58,160\nbout this high, there's a good\nchance that hard drive will fail.\n\n398\n00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,610\nBut an LTO tape can take some good,\ngood damage.\n\n399\n00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,760\nYou know, you can throw it in the trunk\nof your car, and drive around, and\n\n400\n00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,665\nit'll usually be fine.\n\n401\n00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:06,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we still see these tape drives\n\n402\n00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,390\nindividual drives, like these,\nwhere you just pop a single tape in it, or\n\n403\n00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,723\nbigger ones, like the tape robots-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:13,905\n>> Like these guys, which are the,\n\n405\n00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:16,441\nyou know, almost the size of\na refrigerator they might hold hundreds of\n\n406\n00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,670\ntapes inside of them.\n\n407\n00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,831\nTo backup our systems, and replicate that\ndata to another location there's all\n\n408\n00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:24,828\nsorts of different backup\nsolutions that are out there and\n\n409\n00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:28,180\nyour organization may\nneed something different.\n\n410\n00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,140\nFor a home user though, it can be as\nsimple as using what's built into your\n\n411\n00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,140\nsystem you know, me personally,\nI've got a Mac and so\n\n412\n00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,550\nI use this one terabyte Western\ndigital hard drive that I bought.\n\n413\n00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,880\nIt cost, I think it was like maybe $80\n\n414\n00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,310\nmy laptop only has a 512\ngig hard drive in it.\n\n415\n00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,830\nThis is one terabyte so this is basically\ntwice the size of my laptop and\n\n416\n00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,690\nall I have to do is plug it in and\n\n417\n00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,160\nthe laptop will back itself up\nwhenever this drive is attached.\n\n418\n00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,270\nSo each day when our show goes over,\nI plug this in to my laptop and\n\n419\n00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,140\neach day when the show starts I unplug it\nand my laptop's just set to backup anytime\n\n420\n00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,255\nthis is attached, and\nit'll keep previous versions.\n\n421\n00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:12,940\nAnd the problem is,\nI have to remember this drive.\n\n422\n00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,060\nWhen I take my laptop on the road or\nwhatever,\n\n423\n00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,350\nI leave the drive here at the office.\n\n424\n00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,804\nSo now my data is in two different places,\nand I'm not trusting somebody else to\n\n425\n00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,743\nstore the data I'm storing my own data,\nall right.\n\n426\n00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:28,073\nSo systems like that are,\nare pretty neat, pretty handy and\n\n427\n00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:31,291\ngive you that opportunity to\nbe able to recover your data.\n\n428\n00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,869\n>> Now Don, they call it one\nmore on the objectives which\n\n429\n00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,455\nis the network attach storage.\n\n430\n00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,189\n>> Network attach storage is for\nus a device that we can have,\n\n432\n00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:44,853\nreally a mini computer this whole job\nin design is to have hard drives and\n\n433\n00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:46,972\nhave a basic operating system.\n\n434\n00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,835\nEnough so that we can actually\nget access to those drives and\n\n435\n00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,848\nbe able to use a folder structure on them.\n\n436\n00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n437\n00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,210\nA, a great example and this is another\none that we use here in the office.\n\n438\n00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,360\nWe use network attached storage\nfrom a company called Drobo,\n\n439\n00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,310\nI've got their website pulled up here and\n\n440\n00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,490\nDrobo makes a number of different\nnetwork attached devices.\n\n441\n00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,380\nAnd they're basically miniature computers\nright if you look at this one right here,\n\n442\n00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,580\nwell this one's direct attach, where's\na network one this one's a network one.\n\n443\n00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,430\nSo basically it's a black box and you can\nstick a handful of hard drives in there.\n\n444\n00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,850\nThis one can hold five hard drives so you\ncould pop several hard drives in there,\n\n445\n00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,630\nand back your data up to this system.\n\n446\n00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,120\nAnd it plugs into the network so if your\nphysical computer is completely dead,\n\n447\n00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,500\nyou can just go to another computer and\naccess this and get to your data.\n\n448\n00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,840\nAnd it uses these multiple hard\ndrives to create redundancy so\n\n449\n00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,460\nif one hard drive fails, it's got multiple\ncopies of your data inside of the box.\n\n450\n00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,000\nSo it's all kinda self-contained\nDrobo is a big example.\n\n451\n00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,520\nThere's QNAP is another one that's really\npopular lately these make all sorts of\n\n452\n00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,990\nstuff so there's, there's a number of\ndifferent ones that are available.\n\n453\n00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,950\nThe one Marvin was taking about\nwas a space monkey which,\n\n454\n00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,462\nlike I said I hadn't worked with that one.\n\n455\n00:21:58,462 --> 00:21:59,926\nHe said he got it on a Kickstarter so\n\n456\n00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,306\nlet's see if we can pull that\nup real quick, here we go.\n\n457\n00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,286\nWell, it certainly [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, nice [CROSSTALK]\n\n458\n00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:04,710\n>> Looks cool.\n\n459\n00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,220\nOnce device a terabyte of\npersonal cloud storage so, so\n\n460\n00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,120\nthese, these types of devices they\ndon't require your computer operate.\n\n461\n00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,740\nThey plug right into the network and\nback up your data so\n\n462\n00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,630\nthis is actually really cool.\n\n463\n00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,185\nI'll have to,\n\n464\n00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,932\nI'll have to read more about that well\nunless it's incredibly expensive.\n\n465\n00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:19,629\nSo sorry!\n\n466\n00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,546\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Aw that was [INAUDIBLE]\n\n467\n00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,405\n>> Marvin got the last one.\n\n468\n00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:25,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> That might be true but but yeah.\n\n469\n00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,050\nSo you know there's a lot of devices that\nare out there that are like these, and\n\n470\n00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,920\nbasically, they take away your dependence\non having a single operating machine,\n\n471\n00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560\nand allow you to have that backup.\n\n472\n00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,830\nBut, if your house was just now catching\non fire, you can just grab that little box\n\n473\n00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,550\nand run right out the door as fast\nas you could you just got your data.\n\n474\n00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,364\nRight, and now you,\nyou've saved your family photos or\n\n475\n00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,014\nwhatever it is that you've got.\n\n476\n00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:48,440\nGranted you lost your wardrobe, but\n\n477\n00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,308\nif you're like me you could probably\nstand to lose your entire wardrobe.\n\n478\n00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:54,405\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] so one way the same fashion,\n\n479\n00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:54,910\nright?\n\n480\n00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,326\nOnce every few years I burn the house\ndown so I get all new clothes.\n\n481\n00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:01,950\n[LAUGH] So, so these are all things that\nwe need to think about when we do our\n\n482\n00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,340\nbasic back up now the last point we have\n\n483\n00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,560\nis the one that the most people forget and\nthis is, is the dangerous one.\n\n484\n00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,970\nWhenever you do a backup,\nyou should not trust it.\n\n485\n00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,820\nMost people will do backups for\nyears, and years, and years and\n\n486\n00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,530\nnot need them and then all a sudden\nthey have a failure and they need it and\n\n487\n00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,360\nthey find out that their back ups weren't\nworking properly and they can't use them.\n\n488\n00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,290\nIt's really important\nto test your back up.\n\n489\n00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,916\nTest your back up while things are running\ngood because that way you can fix\n\n490\n00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,970\nthe problem and you're okay.\n\n491\n00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,520\nDon't wait to test your backup until\nyou've had a failure because if\n\n492\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,080\nsomething's wrong it's too late at that\npoint so you do need to test to make sure\n\n493\n00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,490\nthat your backup works and I'll, I'll\nshow you just a quick test here on mine.\n\n494\n00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,090\nI'll take this hard drive and\nthrow it onto my system and this is my,\n\n495\n00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,880\nmy backup hard drive so I can, oh,\nit helps if I plug in the right cord.\n\n496\n00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,648\nIt's not an HDMI hard drive.\n\n497\n00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,214\nSo, so I'm just plugging in my\nhard drive and let's pull up my,\n\n498\n00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,080\nmydesktop here real quick, I'll minimize.\n\n499\n00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,879\nAll right.\nSo, I just plugged this in, and\n\n500\n00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,583\nI'm running a Mac.\n\n501\n00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,292\nAnd so\nit just picked up my backup hard drives.\n\n502\n00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,100\nSo there it is.\n\n503\n00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,990\nIt sees that hard drive.\n\n504\n00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,340\nAnd, I used this little\nprogram called Time Machine.\n\n505\n00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,411\nIt is built into the operating system.\n\n506\n00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,632\nIf you're using Microsoft Windows, it\nactually has what's called Windows Backup\n\n507\n00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,774\nthat's built into it,\nit does the same thing, right?\n\n508\n00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:21,422\nThey work basically the same way.\n\n509\n00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:22,943\nAnd when I click on that,\n\n510\n00:24:22,943 --> 00:24:26,357\nI'll see that I've got where\nI can back up now if I want.\n\n511\n00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:29,417\nIt's telling me my last backup\nwas done on November 12, so\n\n512\n00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,370\nI'm actually a little overdue there,\naren't I?\n\n513\n00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,380\nSo I'm, so I'm a little bit behind.\n\n514\n00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,230\nAnd so, see how it says Preparing Backup?\n\n515\n00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,220\nIt saw that I was a little bit behind, and\n\n516\n00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,266\nit's starting a backup right now\nwhile I'm on the show, right?\n\n517\n00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,690\nAnd that, that's fine.\n\n518\n00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,530\nBut, I can also skip the backup,\nwhich, actually, I think I'm gonna do,\n\n519\n00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,830\ncuz I don't want my\nsystem to run slow here.\n\n520\n00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,020\nAnd I can enter the time machine,\nwhich is just their fancy way of saying,\n\n521\n00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,330\nlet's browse through our historical data.\n\n522\n00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,340\nSo when I come in here,\nnow I'm seeing my hard drive.\n\n523\n00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,000\nAnd see what it just did?\n\n524\n00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,290\nThis is my folder of show notes for\nthis show.\n\n525\n00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,180\nSo the FC0-U51,\nthat's the CompTIA IT Fundamentals.\n\n526\n00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,000\nAnd I can see all these different files\nas they were at this point in time today.\n\n527\n00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,730\nSo, as of today, this is what my show\nnotes folder looked like, right?\n\n528\n00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,660\nBut if we start going back in time, we'll\nfind that it didn't always look this way.\n\n529\n00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,840\nSo, like, if I take our notes for\nthis episode, we're in 5.4 right here.\n\n530\n00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880\nSo there it is.\n\n531\n00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,400\nAnd I can see this one, the markdown\nfile that I made just this morning,\n\n532\n00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400\nright today at 11:48 a.m.\n\n533\n00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,675\nWell, if I go back to yesterday or\nthe last backup.\n\n534\n00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:40,705\nNow I'm looking at it, and I can see 5.4,\nexplain basic backups, and\n\n535\n00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,295\nmy markdown one isn't there.\n\n536\n00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:45,205\nWell, that's because I hadn't\nmade it at that point.\n\n537\n00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,195\nIt's not present.\n\n538\n00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:50,890\nAnd if I keep going back, I'll see where\neventually that 5.3 file will disappear,\n\n539\n00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,535\ncuz I didn't always have that one.\n\n540\n00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:54,295\nNow let's see.\nCan I just jump back several?\n\n541\n00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:58,210\nSo, as I start to jump back, we'll get\nto where now there's just the 5.3, oops,\n\n542\n00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,890\nthat looks a little different.\n\n543\n00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,426\nLet's see how far back I can go.\n\n544\n00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:08,313\nIs this, like, my first backup here,\nway back September 19th.\n\n545\n00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,472\nI guess that file didn't exist,\nit's not letting me click on it.\n\n546\n00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:13,398\nSo, you can only go back so far, I guess.\n\n547\n00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:17,230\nBut but basically, these are each of the\nones kind of laid out and what it was like\n\n548\n00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,060\nback then before I started modifying it or\nchanging it or whatever.\n\n549\n00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,820\nSo, that's the cool part about\nhaving a backup like these.\n\n550\n00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,770\nI can see what the documents looked like\nback then and I can restore them if I want\n\n551\n00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,000\nto, or maybe I just want to check and\nsee what it looked like back then.\n\n552\n00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,650\nThat's what your backup software does.\n\n553\n00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,260\nAll right,\nnow it might not look exactly like this.\n\n554\n00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,930\nIf it's the Windows backup software,\nit looks a little bit different.\n\n555\n00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,150\nI find the Windows one is\na little more easy for me to use.\n\n556\n00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,390\nThis, kind of,\nTime Machine's a little bit convoluted.\n\n557\n00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,398\nBut but, you know, you basically\npick a system that works for you.\n\n558\n00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,462\nIf you don't have backup software,\nyou can always just use third party stuff.\n\n559\n00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:55,798\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The Crash Plan guys,\n\n560\n00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,513\nthey actually have a free backup\nsoftware that you can use,\n\n561\n00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:00,230\nif you don't use their servers.\n\n562\n00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,010\nSo you can have it backup to your own NAS,\nor, or whatever, and\n\n563\n00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,870\nit'll do that just fine.\n\n564\n00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,070\nI know we use that on,\non one machine here where it's not\n\n565\n00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,420\nactually backing up to Crash Plan systems,\nbut just different systems here.\n\n566\n00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,350\nSo, it's up to you what you want to use,\nbut test it.\n\n567\n00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,760\nHook up your backup drive and\nsee if you can restore a file,\n\n568\n00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,070\nsee if you can access some\nof the data on that backup.\n\n569\n00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,930\nAnd if you can, great.\n\n570\n00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,030\nIt's a good backup.\n\n571\n00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,020\nBut if you can't, if I had gone in to Time\nMachine and I couldn't access that backup,\n\n572\n00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,060\nI would know, oh,\nI might have a problem with this drive.\n\n573\n00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,840\nI might need to do a new\nbackup on a different drive,\n\n574\n00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,510\ncuz this one might be about to fail.\n\n575\n00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,020\nI wouldn't know unless I tested it, so.\n\n576\n00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,440\n>> So, in this episode,\nwe wanna talk about the basic backups.\n\n577\n00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,813\nWe wanna make sure, of course, that we\nemphasize that what we need to do is we\n\n578\n00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,630\nneed to schedule the backups\nto occur regularly.\n\n579\n00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,167\nWe also want to ensure\nthat we pick a location,\n\n580\n00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:53,959\npreferably one that is different\nthan our physical machine itself.\n\n581\n00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:58,791\nAnd then lastly, we talked about the,\nthe different ways of doing versioning and\n\n582\n00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:03,762\nthe also some of the different backups\nthat we have offsite and, you know,\n\n583\n00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:04,616\neven onsite.\n\n584\n00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,790\nAnd NAS as well and that last thing\nthat we talked about was the-\n\n585\n00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,620\n>> Just verifying.\n\n586\n00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,960\n>> Verifying that it works.\n\n587\n00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,554\nYeah.\n>> So\n\n588\n00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:14,644\nmake sure that you go back\nmaybe do a restoration.\n\n589\n00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,824\nVerify that those files are there that\nyou expect to see there and backup.\n\n590\n00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:20,520\n>> Yeah, and that's basically it,\nthose are our basic steps.\n\n591\n00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,910\nNow, obviously you can go\ncrazy with this stuff.\n\n592\n00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,440\nThere's a lot of advanced things for\nthose of you that go onto A plus,\n\n593\n00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,060\nwe'll talk about things like differential\nand email backups and all that good stuff.\n\n594\n00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,470\nWhich is important, but for\nthe CompTIA IT Fundamentals,\n\n595\n00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,950\nwe just want the basic concept.\n\n596\n00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,970\nAll right, well we're gonna\nwrap up this show right there.\n\n597\n00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,510\nNow, remember, if you have any\nquestions on this, just let us know.\n\n598\n00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,300\nLive during the show,\n\n599\n00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,545\nyou can go to it itpro.tv/live, and\nyou'll see the chatroom beneath the video.\n\n600\n00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:49,135\nPost your question there and\nwe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n601\n00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:53,035\nIf you have questions

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:39,353\nWelcome back to another episode of\nITproTV, I'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,320\nback to you and Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,530\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,605\nIt is Friday, you can't beat that.\n\n9\n00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:47,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n10\n00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,940\nwe are ready for another exciting\nepisode into IT fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,430\n>> That's right.\nSo diving right into\n\n12\n00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,060\nCompTIA IT fundamentals,\nwe've been working on exam objective 5.0,\n\n13\n00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,080\nwhich is basic IT literacy, and\nwe're actually at our last objective.\n\n14\n00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,710\n>> Awesome.\n\n15\n00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,680\n>> Our last objective is 5.5, and\nit's got a nice, long name for us.\n\n16\n00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,710\nDescribe the importance and impact of\nvarious environmental and safety concepts.\n\n17\n00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,080\nSo, we've got two different\nthings covered in this objective.\n\n18\n00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,020\nThe way it's written is\na little bit confusing.\n\n19\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,370\nWe've got environmental concepts and\nwe've got safety concepts.\n\n20\n00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,230\nSo two different pieces, we're gonna\nstart off with environmental but\n\n21\n00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,950\nthey're interrelated because some of\nthe environmental stuff we worry about it,\n\n22\n00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,470\nit, it involves toxic chemicals,\nwhich starts to involve safety and so\n\n23\n00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,870\nthat's why CompTIA had\nchose to put them together.\n\n24\n00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,655\nThese are very important topics\nthat are commonly overlooked,\n\n25\n00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,065\nespecially by regular consumers, right?\n\n26\n00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:45,155\nIn the enterprise world, there's usually\nemployees who are responsible for\n\n27\n00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:49,835\nmanaging this, they're very aware of it,\nbut at home, a lot of people don't realize\n\n28\n00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:54,505\nthat a lot of the computer components that\nwe use, and just electronics in general,\n\n29\n00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:57,435\nhave various safety measures and\nenvironmental impact that we have to\n\n30\n00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:01,440\nworry about just through their regular use\nand ultimately through their disposal.\n\n31\n00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,700\nWith it being right around the corner from\nour holiday season, here in the states,\n\n33\n00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,220\nthere's a lot of times that people\nare gonna be buying brand new computers,\n\n34\n00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,360\ngetting things set up, getting ready\nto go, and they're taking their\n\n35\n00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,580\nfive year old computer or\nolder and they're putting it aside.\n\n36\n00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,080\nLater on, that computer is probably\ngonna end up in the dumpster.\n\n37\n00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,810\nOr just put out onto the curb\nwhere somebody they're hoping's\n\n38\n00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,170\ngonna pick it up.\n\n39\n00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,138\nBut, that's not really\nthe best way to dispose of it.\n\n40\n00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:31,870\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthat there are proper disposal techniques\n\n41\n00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,890\nthat we need to make sure that we follow.\n\n42\n00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,770\n>> Yeah,\nany of your discarded electronics,\n\n43\n00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,230\nthat's something that's called e-waste.\n\n44\n00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,610\nYou know, electronic waste.\n\n45\n00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> And e-waste, in general,\n\n46\n00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,770\nshould never be disposed of\nwith your regular trash, right?\n\n47\n00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,750\nIt does vary in, in countries and\neven regions within a country.\n\n48\n00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,610\nBut, for example, here the majority of the\nwaste that we dispose of in our city and\n\n49\n00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,500\ncounty goes to landfill.\n\n50\n00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,690\nAnd that is not uncommon, right.\n\n51\n00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,250\nIn most areas the landfill is\nthe solution for, for disposal.\n\n52\n00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,420\nSo, if we're talking about\nthings like you know,\n\n53\n00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,325\nold cereal boxes and rotten fruit, and\nthings like that, they throw it in the,\n\n54\n00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:13,570\nthe landfill, it decomposes and it\nre-integrates with the Earth is the idea.\n\n55\n00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,380\nBut when we throw away toxic chemicals,\nthey go into the landfill.\n\n56\n00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,580\nThey don't degrade.\n\n57\n00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,950\nThey seep through the landfill and\n\n58\n00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,830\neventually make it down into our water\nsupply, and so we slowly damage ourselves.\n\n59\n00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,420\nAnd granted, the particles are, are pretty\nlow as far as particles per million.\n\n60\n00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,450\nBut over time they build up.\n\n61\n00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,300\nAnd so right now we don't have that big of\na problem, but maybe a few hundred years\n\n62\n00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,510\nfrom now we will and then we'll\nkind of be sweating that, won't we?\n\n63\n00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,550\nSo, there's steps we can take now\nto make sure that's not a problem.\n\n64\n00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,510\nAll right.\n\n65\n00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,760\nSo any time you're dealing with\nan electrical device of any sort,\n\n66\n00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,150\nbe it a computer,\na cell phone, a television,\n\n67\n00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,410\na video game console, any,\nany electronic device.\n\n68\n00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,820\nBefore you just dump it in the trash,\nthink of a few things, right?\n\n69\n00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,990\nAnd that's what we're gonna run down.\n\n70\n00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,390\nThe list of things we need to be aware of,\nright?\n\n71\n00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,736\nThe very first thing is that many of\nthe electronic devices you buy might\n\n72\n00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:09,880\nhave a little mark on the bottom\nof them that says R-O-H-S.\n\n73\n00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,170\nAnd Ronnie,\nyou are intimately familiar with this.\n\n74\n00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,070\n>> Yes, I am.\nYeah.\n\n75\n00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,060\nYeah, RoHS, a lot of times written in\ncapital R lowercase o and then capital H\n\n76\n00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,940\nand S, it stands for the restriction\nof hazardous substance directives.\n\n77\n00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,260\nNow, this is a directive\nthat was issued out by,\n\n78\n00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,200\nI don't really know exactly\nwho it was issued by.\n\n79\n00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,640\n>> The EU is where it was really\nkicked off it's a European initiative.\n\n80\n00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,520\n>> So, so we, we have this directive\nthat was issued out by, by the EU.\n\n81\n00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,710\nThose companies are,\nare saying that they're gonna follow this\n\n82\n00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,370\nrestriction of really six\nparticular substances and, and\n\n83\n00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,920\nthey generally involve things like\nlead and mercury, heavy metals, right?\n\n84\n00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720\nLead, mercury, cadmium, and\n\n85\n00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,200\nthen they name a couple of\ndifferent flame retardants too.\n\n86\n00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,650\nAnd what they're saying is that\nthese companies that are going to\n\n87\n00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,920\npush these products out, or sell these\nproducts, they're suppose to give you,\n\n88\n00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,630\nas a consumer, an alternative,\n\n89\n00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,381\ninstead of just dumping it into\nyour garbage at the end of the day.\n\n90\n00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:14,490\nYour bin at the end of the day,\nthat they're supposed to give you away.\n\n91\n00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,480\nYou should actually be able\nto expose of it properly.\n\n92\n00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n93\n00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,390\nAnd what that means is either they\nchoose not to use that chemical, right?\n\n94\n00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,940\nSo they, they manufacture the device or\nwhatever not using that material.\n\n95\n00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,960\nOr, they go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,340\nuse it, and then they tell\nthe customer one or two things, right?\n\n97\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,500\nEither one, when you're done with this,\nyou can return it back to us and\n\n98\n00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,000\nwe'll dispose it for you, or two,\nwe will cover your expense of\n\n99\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,570\ndisposing any of your local hazardous\nwaste materials facility, right?\n\n100\n00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,980\nSo, you get various methods on that.\n\n101\n00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,680\nNow, it was a European initiative and\nit was adopted,\n\n102\n00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,610\nand I believe all the countries\nin the EU do it now.\n\n103\n00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,390\nSo, if you purchase an electronics device,\nyou just take a look at you know,\n\n104\n00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,110\nwe're used to seeing things like this\nsticker right here that is just covered\n\n105\n00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,750\nwith little symbols, and\nif you see the RoHS on there, that's your,\n\n106\n00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,210\nyour hint that say, the company that\nmade this, in my case Western Digital,\n\n107\n00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,970\nthey must provide some kind of all\nthe way test solution to dispose of this.\n\n108\n00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,980\nAnd when it's time to get rid of it,\nI should go to their website and\n\n109\n00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,800\nsee what they say, and they might say, hey\nyeah, just ship it right back to us and\n\n110\n00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440\nwe'll toss it for you, right?\n\n111\n00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,950\nAnd you know, they'll properly dispose\nof it, they won't chuck it in the bin.\n\n112\n00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,360\nBut not every company or\ncountry has jumped on this bandwagon.\n\n113\n00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,673\nThe United States is particularly\nresistance as far as joining global\n\n114\n00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:31,686\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n115\n00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:32,952\n>> Safety and environmental issues and\n\n116\n00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:33,770\nstuff like that.\n\n117\n00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,640\nWe have our own, right?\n\n118\n00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,910\nThe EPA, so ROHS is actually\nnot honored here in the US.\n\n119\n00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,980\nNow it doesn't mean you won't\nfind devices with the mark.\n\n120\n00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,673\nIt might have the RoHS mark on there and\nthe company that manufactured it may have\n\n121\n00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:48,550\nchosen to abstain from those chemicals and\nmaterials, so we do benefit.\n\n122\n00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,660\nBut they're not obligated to take return\nreceipt of the device when you're\n\n123\n00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,390\ndone with it, so don't count on\nthat here in the United States.\n\n124\n00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,790\nHere, in the US, we have hazardous waste\nmaterial facilities in almost every\n\n125\n00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,015\ncounty, so\nnormally you can go to the website for\n\n126\n00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,760\nthe county that you live in, and\nthey'll have an e-waste program.\n\n127\n00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,130\nAnd so you'll go through them\nto be able to dispose of it.\n\n128\n00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,530\nThere's some commercial entities, too.\n\n129\n00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,040\nBut there's almost always\na government-sponsored\n\n130\n00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,290\nwaste facility in your, in your county.\n\n131\n00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,420\n>> Yep.\n\n132\n00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,570\nOur next device is the CRT monitor.\n\n133\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,790\nMost of us aren't gonna see\na lot of these anymore.\n\n134\n00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,250\nBut, you'll probably be surprised if you\ngo to someone's home and you open up\n\n135\n00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,820\nthe garage, sitting on the shelf or\nin the corner somewhere is probably gonna\n\n136\n00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,690\nbe a CRT monitor, a cathode ray tube\nmonitor that's just sitting there,\n\n137\n00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,730\nbecause they are not actually ready\nto dump it into the garbage yet, or\n\n138\n00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,160\nthey were told that they were not supposed\nto dump them in because it could cause,\n\n139\n00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,580\nwell again, some problems, not only with\nenvironment, but because they can explode.\n\n140\n00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,088\nSo they tend to hold onto them, but\n\n141\n00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,542\nthen we should find a proper\nway to dispose of those too.\n\n142\n00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,955\n>> For our younger viewers, CRT monitors\nare what we had before flat screens.\n\n143\n00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,445\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We didn't always have these nice\n\n144\n00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:55,986\nflat screens that\neverybody's got these days.\n\n145\n00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,381\nThe LCDs and LEDs.\n\n146\n00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:00,166\nSo, I pulled up a,\na Google image search here.\n\n147\n00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,272\nJust to kinda be able to show you.\n\n148\n00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,975\nThese are what CRT monitors look like and\nthey were huge and heavy.\n\n149\n00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:07,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They have these giant glass tubes in\n\n150\n00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,160\nthem that the images were\nactually projected on and\n\n151\n00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,460\nthey were just bulky devices.\n\n152\n00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,850\nAnd this is, this is all we had prior to,\nI don't know what, like, 2003 or\n\n153\n00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,680\n2004 is when we started to see regular\nconsumer availability for flat screens.\n\n154\n00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,710\nSo, for\na long time these are what we used.\n\n155\n00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,770\nThe biggest problem with them, is that\nthe CRT itself was lined with lead,\n\n156\n00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,000\nand lead is a toxic material.\n\n157\n00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,450\nYou'll find a lot of electronics\ninclude lead in their construction, and\n\n158\n00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:34,970\nthat's the problem.\n\n159\n00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,140\nLead and mercury are the two\nbig ones that we see the most.\n\n160\n00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,260\nSo, with a CRT,\n\n161\n00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,310\nit's imperative that you do not\ndispose of it with the regular waste.\n\n162\n00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,960\nIf lead gets into the landfill, lead\ncan get down into the water system and\n\n163\n00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,610\nit is toxic to humans, so\nwe don't want that, right?\n\n164\n00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,500\nSo instead we gotta take these\nto a hazardous waste disposal.\n\n165\n00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,210\nSo you'll find those you know,\nlike with the other stuff, usually your,\n\n166\n00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,449\nyour county will provide that service.\n\n167\n00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,990\nAll right, our next one is scanners.\n\n168\n00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,530\nNow, most scanners don't have anything\ntoo terribly special in them, and\n\n169\n00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,550\nthey can be disposed of with e-waste.\n\n170\n00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,310\nBut there are some scanners that work\nwith different technologies, and\n\n171\n00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,460\nthe bulb that's included in\nthem may contain various gases.\n\n172\n00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,660\nAnd so those gases may be toxic.\n\n173\n00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660\nIt's not always true.\n\n174\n00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,200\nI've had scanners where it was labeled\naround the box perfectly safe to throw\n\n175\n00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,220\nin the trash.\n\n176\n00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,740\nAnd I've had others scanners that weren't,\nthe,\n\n177\n00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,760\nthe commercial grades ones are normally\nthe ones that are a little more hazardous.\n\n178\n00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,470\nSo, you may need to read to documentation\nof your scanner before tossing it.\n\n179\n00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,780\n>> We also call our batteries, for,\nfor especially computers because\n\n180\n00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,210\nwe're not only talking about\nalkaline batteries here.\n\n181\n00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,680\nA lot of times were talking about\nthose nickel cadmium batteries.\n\n182\n00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,440\nThose old batteries that have been around\nforever and that, those things on,\n\n183\n00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,108\non the nickel or cadmium side is really\nwhat is toxic to the environment.\n\n184\n00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,380\nSo we wanna make sure that we carefully\ndispose of those properly too.\n\n185\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,740\nThe environmental place where you go and\nrecycle,\n\n186\n00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,658\nthat's probably the best\nplace to take them.\n\n187\n00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,160\n>> You know, you find that a lot of\nstores actually do battery recycling too.\n\n188\n00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,530\nIf you go to Radio Shack, I know that\nthere's, almost all automotive stores are,\n\n189\n00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,540\nare geared to handle\nrecycling of batteries.\n\n190\n00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,140\nSo you'll find plenty of places\nwhere you can recycle those.\n\n191\n00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,090\nAlways a good idea,\ndon't chuck your batteries in the trash.\n\n192\n00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,850\nI know, tons and tons of people chuck\nbatteries right into the trash.\n\n193\n00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,150\nAnd that's a habit we've\ndeveloped over the years,\n\n194\n00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,330\nso, really consider not doing that.\n\n195\n00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,380\nInk and toner is next.\n\n196\n00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,680\nSo, if you have a printer and\n\n197\n00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,600\nit's a inkjet printer,\nyou'll have these liquid ink cartridges.\n\n198\n00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,370\nOr, if it's a laser printer,\nyou'll have the toner powder, cartridges.\n\n199\n00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,790\nWell, most of the time\nthey can be disposed.\n\n200\n00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,310\nThe ink is not toxic, you know so there's\nnot that big of a deal throwing it away.\n\n201\n00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,520\nBut the toner, the resin that's used and\nit's actually it's, somewhat inert but\n\n202\n00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520\nit's not exactly great for the environment\nso they recommend that you don't toss that\n\n203\n00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,280\nif you don't need to, even if it was\nperfectly healthy like you could eat it,\n\n204\n00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,620\nwhich it's not, but even if was-\n>> Please don't [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,040\n>> You still don't wanna toss these, and\n\n206\n00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,610\nthe reason is that ink cartridges and\nthe toner cartridges can be reused.\n\n207\n00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,820\nThey're not single use devices,\nso almost every office store,\n\n208\n00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,950\nif you go to Office Depot, Staples,\nOffice Max, somewhere like that\n\n209\n00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,270\nthe majority of them will accept\nprinter cartridges for, for recycling.\n\n210\n00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,200\nAnd what they do is,\n\n211\n00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,182\nthey, they don't grind them up and\nturn them into plant mulch or something.\n\n212\n00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:14,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But all they do is they take and\n\n213\n00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,430\nthey clean them.\n\n214\n00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,900\nThey usually replace the heads on them and\nthen they refill them,\n\n215\n00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,720\nand then they're perfectly good.\n\n216\n00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,063\nAnd then they can sell them and\n\n217\n00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:24,824\nyou can actually buy the recycled ones at\nmost office stores, and they're usually\n\n218\n00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:28,550\na significantly amount cheaper even though\nthey're just as good as the new ones.\n\n219\n00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,390\nSo don't dispose of those.\n\n220\n00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,210\nThey can be recycled.\n\n221\n00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,770\nAnd you're just saving on plastics and\nother materials being you know,\n\n222\n00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,260\ngenerated fresh.\n\n223\n00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,670\n>> Yeah, and, and the toner, you might\nthink, well, it just looks like powder.\n\n224\n00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,080\nWhy do I really care?\n\n225\n00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,420\nToner is actually made not\nonly of a plastic resin,\n\n226\n00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,205\nbut there's also tiny, tiny medical,\nmetal particles in there.\n\n227\n00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's really powdered dust.\n\n228\n00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,880\nAnd some of those, some of that dust,\nthat's actually in there,\n\n229\n00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,530\nis so tiny it escapes even\nthings like air filters, so\n\n230\n00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,868\nthat's why they don't want it out\nthere in the environment, and\n\n231\n00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,940\njust you know, spraying out there\ninto the world, because remember,\n\n232\n00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,600\nit's just getting out there, sinks into\nthe ground and gets into water systems.\n\n233\n00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,140\nAnd even some of those filters\nmight not catch that, so\n\n234\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,350\nthat's why you don't\nwant to do that either.\n\n235\n00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,900\nAnd the last one on our list to keep\nan eye out for are hard drives.\n\n237\n00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,479\nNow, hard drives don't actually\ncontain a lot of toxic materials.\n\n238\n00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:19,190\nThere's, there's a little tiny\ncircuit board in there which\n\n239\n00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,540\ncan carry some trace amounts of,\nof toxic chemicals.\n\n240\n00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,490\nBut, the reason it's on the list\nhere is that your hard drive\n\n241\n00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,890\nhas something even more dangerous on it,\nyour data, right?\n\n242\n00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,900\nWhen you throw a hard drive in the trash\nor a computer that has a hard drive in it,\n\n243\n00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,370\nanybody could grab that\ncomputer out of the trash,\n\n244\n00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,480\ngrab that hard drive and\npotentially get your data.\n\n245\n00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,850\nSo when we dispose of a hard drive, we're\nnot so much worried about the environment.\n\n246\n00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,790\nWe're worried about protecting\nour personal information.\n\n247\n00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,580\nNow if the drive is encrypted,\nyou might not worry about that.\n\n248\n00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,110\nBut most drives aren't.\n\n249\n00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,060\nSo, you need to make sure that\nyou've erased the data off of there.\n\n250\n00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,020\nNow forensic recovery\nsoftware has come a long way.\n\n251\n00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,920\nEven the consumer grade stuff, these days.\n\n252\n00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,190\nSo, law enforcement, and, and\n\n253\n00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,570\nhackers in general can still recover\ndata even after you've erased it.\n\n254\n00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,880\nSo, when we destroy a hard drive, a hard\ndrive, or when we dispose of a hard drive,\n\n255\n00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,860\nit's usually a good idea\nto render it inoperable and\n\n256\n00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,990\nthere's several ways to do that.\n\n257\n00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,090\nYou can drill holes down\nthrough the platters.\n\n258\n00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,790\nYou can go to, there's,\n\n259\n00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,695\nthere's disposal facilities where\nthey'll actually shred the hard drive.\n\n260\n00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:23,245\nIf you've ever seen a paper shredder,\nthey have these industrial strength giant\n\n261\n00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,775\nclaw monster things and\nthey're pretty scary looking.\n\n262\n00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,575\nAnd they'll grind up that hard drive and\n\n263\n00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:30,405\nmake sure that it can't be,\ncan't be accessed, right?\n\n264\n00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:33,985\nIt's all about protecting your data\nwhen you dispose a hard drive.\n\n265\n00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:34,845\n>> Yeah.\nA lot of times if you're\n\n266\n00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,245\nreally not sure about any of these\nthings that we've mentioned,\n\n267\n00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:41,395\nright, take it to that environmental,\nthat, that recyclable location and\n\n268\n00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,380\nthey normally can give you guidance\non what should be done with it.\n\n269\n00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,790\nBut a lot of times you can also go\nto the manufacturer's website, and\n\n270\n00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,360\nthere is a link for a lot of these things,\nespecially like toner cartridges, and\n\n271\n00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,100\nyou'll see it called\nthe materials safety data sheet.\n\n272\n00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,330\nAnd that will tell you where\nyou can take that as well.\n\n273\n00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,800\n>> Yeah, so those are some of the things\nthat we need to be aware of as we think of\n\n274\n00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,480\nour environmental side.\n\n275\n00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,780\nAnd we've got a few things that\nwe'll kind of talk about later, but\n\n276\n00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,170\none of the biggest ways that we can\nimpact the environment in computing,\n\n277\n00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,430\nis not so much to how we dispose thing,\ncuz you don't do that everyday, but\n\n278\n00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,250\nin how you use your computer\non a day to day basis.\n\n279\n00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,020\nWhen you get a new, you may have it for\nthree years, five years, and\n\n280\n00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,810\nin that time, that computer\nconsumes a good bit of electricity.\n\n281\n00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,150\nSo, there are certain things we can do\non our systems to reduce the amount of\n\n282\n00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,780\nelectrical draw.\n\n283\n00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,910\nNow, here's the thing I\nwould say is you know,\n\n284\n00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,610\nit doesn't matter if you're a liberal or\nconservative.\n\n285\n00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,990\nIf you're Republican or Democrat or\nif you're a hippie or, or not.\n\n286\n00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,202\nYou know, if you're a tree hugger.\n\n287\n00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> None of that really matters, right?\n\n288\n00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,135\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you, if you love the Earth and\n\n289\n00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,365\nthe environment, right, you wanna,\nyou wanna save the trees and\n\n290\n00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,085\nthe bunny rabbits, that's great, right?\n\n291\n00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,445\nBut even if you hate all that stuff,\neverybody likes to save money.\n\n292\n00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:52,035\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n293\n00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:55,505\nif there's something we can do on\nour computer to make it consume less\n\n294\n00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:59,267\nelectricity, then that means our electric\nor our utility bill goes down, and\n\n295\n00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,137\nwe save money.\n\n296\n00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:03,937\nEverybody likes that, doesn't matter what\npolitical party you're in or whatever.\n\n297\n00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,157\nSo, so when it comes to power management,\n\n298\n00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,567\nthese basic steps we really\nwanna take advantage of.\n\n299\n00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,907\nFor your own home, it may not\nmake that gigantic a difference.\n\n300\n00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:16,277\nYou might just save a buck or\ntwo a month, you know, not a big deal.\n\n301\n00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:19,310\nBut if you work for\na company that has 10,000 computers, and\n\n302\n00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,350\neach one can save you a dollar a month,\nthat's $10,000 a month you just saved.\n\n303\n00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,100\nThat's a big deal right there.\n\n304\n00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,160\nSo we need everybody to kind of think\nabout that, as we configure our computers.\n\n305\n00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,650\nThe more of us that make that change,\nthe more money it saves.\n\n306\n00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,390\nIt does make a big difference.\n\n307\n00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,560\nSo, how we control power on our devices,\nour laptops and\n\n308\n00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,530\nour desktops,\nis how we directly impact that.\n\n309\n00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,410\n>> You know one thing.\n\n310\n00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,624\nA neatest ways, and, and\nI would have never thought about this.\n\n311\n00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:47,929\nTo save power a lot of times is to go and\nupgrade the machine that you already have\n\n312\n00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:52,366\nthat may have been running perfectly fine\nfor the last five or six years, to newer\n\n313\n00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:56,531\nequipment because newer technology\nhas come out to actually save us.\n\n314\n00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,759\nAgain better electricity or more you know,\n\n315\n00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,150\nto become more efficient\nin terms of power usage.\n\n316\n00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,270\nAnd we had that happen\nright here in our building.\n\n317\n00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,115\nWe, we had several servers that we've\nbeen running for years and years.\n\n318\n00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,065\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we were able to find out that if we\n\n319\n00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:14,910\nupgraded to these newer servers, it would\nsave us a tremendous amount of money.\n\n320\n00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,080\n>> Yeah, the servers actually\nend up paying for themselves,\n\n321\n00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,100\njust replacing the servers\nalone would pay for\n\n322\n00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,920\nthemselves in energy savings over\nthe course of, I think it was two years.\n\n323\n00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it was kind of neat to see that\n\n324\n00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,820\nyou know, a lot of us don't realize how\nmuch electricity devices can consume.\n\n325\n00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,950\nEven when they're turned off, a lot of\ndevices will still consume electricity.\n\n326\n00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,690\nSo, some of the things to think about.\n\n327\n00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,020\nFirst off, when you go to buy equipment,\ndon't just blindly buy equipment,\n\n328\n00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,830\nlook at the energy rating, right?\n\n329\n00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,910\nIn the United States we have a government\norganization called Energy Star, and\n\n330\n00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,960\nit's a division of the,\nI always forget who it's the division of,\n\n331\n00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,775\nnot the EPA,, but, something,\noh no it is the EPA.\n\n332\n00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:52,391\n[CROSSTALK] Yep.\n\n333\n00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:54,100\nSo it is part of the EPA.\n\n334\n00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,990\nAnd, what they do is they help\nto rate electronic devices.\n\n335\n00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,250\nSo when you buy a monitor, a TV,\na computer, a refrigerator,\n\n336\n00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,770\na hot water heater, it'll have an Energy\nStar rating that helps you gauge how\n\n337\n00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,130\nenergy efficient it is.\n\n338\n00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,700\nIf it's got an Energy Star Gold rating,\nthen it's pretty good, right?\n\n339\n00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,280\nBut if it has an Energy Star Bronze\nrating, then it's not as good, or\n\n340\n00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,620\nif it's not Energy Star rated at all,\nyou know it's probably pretty bad.\n\n341\n00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,950\nAnd usually the cheaper the equipment you\nget, the worse it's energy profile is.\n\n342\n00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,290\nBut you can come to their website and\n\n343\n00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,650\nthey can show you all\nsorts of different things.\n\n344\n00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,980\nYou can look up products here.\n\n345\n00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,675\nI've got find Energy Star products, and\nwhen you buy a monitor or whatever you can\n\n346\n00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,165\nlook for the Energy Star information,\nso you'll find it in here as you read.\n\n347\n00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:36,415\nThey've got electronics and\nthey cover all sorts of different stuff.\n\n348\n00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:39,325\nI think computers have their own category,\ndon't they?\n\n349\n00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,185\nOr-\n>> Office equipment.\n\n350\n00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,595\n>> Office equipment, there we go.\n\n351\n00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,425\nYep.\nSo we can go in and we can find it and\n\n352\n00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:48,415\nthey, they let you do searches on here,\nbut I usually don't come through this way.\n\n353\n00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,725\nI normally just go to\nthe vendor websites and\n\n354\n00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:52,710\nyou can find it but but like right here.\n\n355\n00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,530\nSo they've got a, an Asus notebook here.\n\n356\n00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,680\nIt's a core i7.\n\n357\n00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,970\nAnd so this is a notebook.\n\n358\n00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,570\nIt is Energy Star rated,\nand if we take a look.\n\n359\n00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,202\nLet's see what the rating is.\n\n360\n00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:06,490\nIt, are they just break all this junk down\nand not tell me the Energy Star rating?\n\n361\n00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,120\n>> Yes, they are.\n[LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,510\n>> That is so lame.\n\n363\n00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,695\nWell, anyhow.\n\n364\n00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:12,340\nSomewhere in here it will actually have\nan Energy Star rating where they tell us\n\n365\n00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,760\nabout how much it actually is,\n\n366\n00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,950\nas far as efficiency compared to\nother laptops that are out there.\n\n367\n00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,100\nSo, use that as part of your influence,\nwhen you buy devices,\n\n368\n00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,190\nbuy energy efficient ones if\nyou have the opportunity.\n\n369\n00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,960\nNow, you may have a particular need that\ndoesn't make it where you can get that and\n\n370\n00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,880\nthat's fine, but when you can,\nyou go ahead and buy them, and\n\n371\n00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,980\nit will make a difference.\n\n372\n00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,110\nNot only can we buy equipment that has\nthese, these different types of ratings\n\n374\n00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,500\nthat really help us to consume less\nelectricity, a lot of times built into\n\n375\n00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,740\nthe operating systems themselves,\nthey have energy control programs\n\n376\n00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,560\nthat really do help to make sure that\nwe're using it as efficiently as possible.\n\n377\n00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,150\nSo for example, in Windows,\nwe have what we call power options.\n\n378\n00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,260\nIs it called the same thing in the Mac OS?\n\n379\n00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,610\n>> On the Mac side,\nit's named a little bit different here.\n\n380\n00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> If I go into my system preferences,\n\n381\n00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,980\nit is labeled under oh shoot, where is it?\n\n382\n00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,060\nIt's there.\n\n383\n00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,140\nEnergy saver\n>> Energy saver.\n\n384\n00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,060\nThat's what they call it,\nyou got a little light bulb.\n\n385\n00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,060\nYeah, it doesn't matter your OS, Linux,\nWindows, whatever, they all have various\n\n386\n00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,930\ntechniques, and if we just look here, I'll\nshow you some of the ones that I have.\n\n387\n00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,700\nI have word called Power Profiles,\nall right?\n\n388\n00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,430\nOne profile for\n\n389\n00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,330\nwhen I'm on battery, and one profile\nwhen I'm plugged into the wall.\n\n390\n00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,680\nWhen I'm on battery, I need a really\nconserve as much electricity as I can to,\n\n391\n00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,470\nto make my battery life\nlast as long as possible.\n\n392\n00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,920\nAnd so you'll see it's got things like put\nthe hard discs to sleep when possible.\n\n393\n00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,430\nIf I'm not using my hard drive,\nthen stop spinning it.\n\n394\n00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,320\nThat spinning motion consumes battery\npower and slightly dim the display because\n\n395\n00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,580\nthe brightness of the display affects the\namount of electricity that I'm drawing.\n\n396\n00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,240\nBut these are all done simply\nto save my own battery power.\n\n397\n00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,770\nRight?\n\n398\n00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,980\nIt's the one that's on power adapter\nthat we really are concerned about.\n\n399\n00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,390\nAnd so you'll see other options in here,\nlike put the hard disc to sleep, I've got\n\n400\n00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,910\nmine so it's got prevent the computer from\nsleeping and never turn the display off.\n\n401\n00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,090\nWell that's because I'm on this show.\n\n402\n00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,340\nI don't want my computer to\ngo to sleep during the show.\n\n403\n00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,550\nBut, when I'm at home,\nI do want it to go to sleep.\n\n404\n00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,400\nI want it to go to sleep\nif I close the lid or\n\n405\n00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,490\nif an application is in the background.\n\n406\n00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,620\nAnd so you see these different\noptions in here that you can specify.\n\n407\n00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,870\nAnd so for me I could go here into\nthis schedule, and I could come in and\n\n408\n00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,760\nset it to,\ngo to sleep at certain times and wake up.\n\n409\n00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,890\nSo if I knew I was gonna be at work from 8\na.m to 5 p.m I might say, go ahead and go\n\n410\n00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,230\nto sleep overnight and then wake up at 8\na.m so it's on when I get into the office.\n\n411\n00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,700\nYou can set up various things like these\nto adjust the amount of power that your\n\n412\n00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,400\nsystem consumes.\n\n413\n00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,180\nSome of the other things your computer\nmight not be the only draw of power.\n\n414\n00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,560\nA lot of people have uninterruptible\npower supplies, or UPSs,\n\n415\n00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,180\nthose are those big battery backups\nthat sit beneath your computer.\n\n416\n00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,870\nWell, those draw quite a bit of power\nto keep those batteries charged.\n\n417\n00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,990\nThey might have line conditioners in them\nthat will also affect the amount of power\n\n418\n00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,000\nthat comes in.\n\n419\n00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,380\nSo we've got to make sure that those are,\nare energy efficient if possible, but\n\n420\n00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,650\na lot of them aren't.\n\n421\n00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,120\nWhen we buy those we're normally\nmore concerned about safety, right?\n\n422\n00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,020\nEnsuring that an electrical impulse\nthat comes through the wall doesn't\n\n423\n00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,620\ndamage our computer.\n\n424\n00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,700\nSo, when you choose to buy something\nlike that, you really have two choices.\n\n425\n00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,600\nYou can do a surge protector, or a UPS.\n\n426\n00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,670\nNow, the problem is,\n\n427\n00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,400\na lot of people get confused as to\nwhat a surge suppressor truly is.\n\n428\n00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,140\nA surge suppressor for a lot of us\nlooks just like a power strip, right?\n\n429\n00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,620\nLet's do a little shopping here,\n\n430\n00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,690\nI'm gonna, I'm just we'll go to Amazon and\ndo a little shopping.\n\n431\n00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,280\nSo, if I look for\njust a power strip, okay?\n\n432\n00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,670\nA power strip is something like this\nwhere I have one outlet on the wall and\n\n433\n00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,920\nit expands it out to multiple outlets,\nall right?\n\n434\n00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,270\nSometimes they are just very basic\npower strips, and that's all they are.\n\n435\n00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,520\nBut other times they're surge suppressors.\n\n436\n00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,570\nNow, visually,\nthey'll pretty much look the same, right?\n\n437\n00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,500\nThe difference is a surge suppressor\nwill actually have a fuse in it, so\n\n438\n00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,850\nthat if a electrical impulse comes across\nthe line, like if your building gets hit\n\n439\n00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,170\nby lightning, it will trip and\nit clamps down on that signal to block\n\n440\n00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,390\nthe impulse from hitting your computer and\nother things that are plugged into it.\n\n441\n00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,090\nSo a regular power strip doesn't\noffer protection from that.\n\n442\n00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,120\nA surge suppressor does.\n\n443\n00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,060\nSo when we buy a power connector\nlike this, we need to make sure\n\n444\n00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,620\nthat it has that surge protection built\nin, and you'll see a lot of these do.\n\n445\n00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,641\nHere's these surge protectors and,\n\n446\n00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:31,500\nand and we'll find some of them in\nhere might not have that, right?\n\n447\n00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,150\n>> It's hard to find one\nwithout 'em anymore.\n\n448\n00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,230\n>> Yeah,\nit does seem like most of these have it.\n\n449\n00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,720\nLet's see power strip with surge,\nyeah they all seem to have it.\n\n450\n00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480\nBut, but\njust be aware that they don't all.\n\n451\n00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,120\nHere, this one.\n\n452\n00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320\n>> Yeah, there ya go.\n>> Master Electrician,\n\n453\n00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,910\nsix outlet power strip.\n\n454\n00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,240\nIt doesn't say anything about being\na surge, suppre, suppressor, and\n\n455\n00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,100\nit's cheaper.\n\n456\n00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,240\nIt's only eight bucks.\n\n457\n00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200\nAnd, that's probably why.\n\n458\n00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,820\nIt probably doesn't have\nthe surge protection.\n\n459\n00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,030\nBut I can see right here for just a few\ndollars more I could get surge protection.\n\n460\n00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,080\nThe only problem with these is they\ndon't protect you from a power outage.\n\n461\n00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,160\nAnd that's where UPS comes in, right?\n\n462\n00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,500\nSo, if we get like a ATC UPS,\n\n463\n00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,930\nyou can get one of these big battery\nmonsters that sits under your desk.\n\n464\n00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,950\nAnd you plug your computer and\nyour other devices into it.\n\n465\n00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,270\nAnd, in addition to giving\nyou the surge protection,\n\n466\n00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,420\nit also gives you some battery life,\nright?\n\n467\n00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,970\nSome extended battery functionality,\nso that you can run your computer for\n\n468\n00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,378\nmaybe only a few minuets,\nmaybe an hour entirely off of battery.\n\n469\n00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:33,256\nReally useful, cuz if your power goes\nout and you're in the middle of working\n\n470\n00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:37,314\non something, you don't wanna lose it,\nwell this will give you battery power so\n\n471\n00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:41,194\nyou can at least save, close your\ndocuments, gracefully shut your computer\n\n472\n00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:44,981\ndown, and then when the power comes\nback on, you can power things back up.\n\n473\n00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:47,862\nNow, with a UPS it's nice,\nin that it helps us to,\n\n474\n00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,745\nto maintain functionality\nwhen the power's out.\n\n475\n00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:53,044\nBut it's also a gigantic battery.\n\n476\n00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:57,086\nSo when it comes to disposing, the UPS,\nyou treat it just like any other battery,\n\n477\n00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:58,501\nyou dispose of it properly.\n\n478\n00:23:58,501 --> 00:24:00,700\n>> Yeah.\nLot of times your decision is,\n\n479\n00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,070\nis based on what you need to protect,\nhow much protection.\n\n480\n00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,290\nAnd remember that along\nwith that the the UPS,\n\n481\n00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,850\nthe Uninterruptible Power Supply,\nIt's probably gonna be more expensive,\n\n482\n00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,610\nthan things like your regular power\nstrip or your surge suppressor as well.\n\n483\n00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,810\n>> All right.\nWell, that's pretty much it for power.\n\n484\n00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,240\nWe do still have some other things\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n485\n00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,860\nWe need to talk a little bit about our,\nour device placement.\n\n486\n00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860\nYou know, where we're actually\nputting our equipment,\n\n487\n00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,050\nwe've got ergonomics to talk about.\n\n488\n00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,130\nA few other little things\nthat we need to address.\n\n489\n00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,450\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break, so\n\n490\n00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,550\nwhy don't we pause here and when we get\nback we're gonna wrap up just the other\n\n491\n00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,710\nlittle details of 5.4 and\nclose things down from there.\n\n492\n00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,310\nSo stay tuned.\n\n493\n00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,543\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n494\n00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:49,518\n[SOUND] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n495\n00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:54,200\nSo our, our next bullet point we need\nto touch on is equipment placement.\n\n496\n00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,780\nAnd what we're really\ntalking about is you know,\n\n497\n00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,558\nyou've got a computer,\nwhere do you physically put the thing?\n\n498\n00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,150\nThere these,\nthis debates you hear from people like\n\n499\n00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,270\nshould I put it up on\nthe desk with the computer?\n\n500\n00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,810\nShould I turn it on its side, should I\nput it beneath the desk on the floor?\n\n501\n00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,670\nDoes, dos it even matter where we put it,\nright?\n\n502\n00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,430\nYeah.\n\n503\n00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,250\n>> Where we do, where we do place\nthe computer tower itself does matter,\n\n504\n00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,770\nbecause there's components inside and\n\n505\n00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,060\nwe have a fan in it, it's trying to\ndraw cold air in, and blow hot air away.\n\n506\n00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,630\nOne of the worst places I ever saw,\nDon, was someone actually put it\n\n507\n00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,500\nbehind their couch, and then put blankets\non top of the computer system, and\n\n508\n00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,470\nthen anything that fell behind the couch\nwas also just about covering the thing up.\n\n509\n00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,080\nAnd they said,\n\n510\n00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,670\nbut that's the quietest place to\nput it Ronnie, is behind the couch.\n\n511\n00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,010\nSo it's out of the way,\n\n512\n00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,600\nyou know with the blankets on top\nit doesn't make that much noise.\n\n513\n00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,080\nAnd I had to tell them there's,\nthis thing needs to breathe.\n\n514\n00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,550\nThere has to be air that\nactually flows through it, so\n\n515\n00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,480\nit was quite amazing that computer\nlasted as long as it did.\n\n516\n00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,410\n>> Now, if you're obstructing\nthe airflow on your computer.\n\n517\n00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,820\nIt's going to generate heat, and the heats\ngoing to get trapped in the computer, and\n\n518\n00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,310\ncomputers have a point\nwhere they can operate, and\n\n519\n00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,000\nthey can actually operate pretty\nhot a lot of times, and be okay.\n\n520\n00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,490\nBut, eventually they'll get so hot,\nthey'll go into thermal shutdown, and\n\n521\n00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,400\nthe machine will just power off.\n\n522\n00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,250\nThe other thing is,\n\n523\n00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,010\nthe warmer you run it, the shorter\nthe lifetime of the electronics will be.\n\n524\n00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,740\nSo you can expect a normal computer to\nlast you a good three to five years,\n\n525\n00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,420\ntypically, without failure.\n\n526\n00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,450\nBut if you're running it hot,\nyou're lucky to hit that three year mark.\n\n527\n00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,850\nYou know?\nThe equipment just isn't\n\n528\n00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,930\ndesigned to operate at\nhigher temperatures.\n\n529\n00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,180\nSo making sure you have good airflow\nis important Ronnie you mentioned how\n\n530\n00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,070\nit's sucking in cool air and bowing out\nhot air, some computers are different but\n\n531\n00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,790\nmost of them, are bringing air\nfrom the front of the case and\n\n532\n00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,480\nblowing it out the back of the case.\n\n533\n00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320\nSo they have hot air exiting the back side\nof the case, that means that if you're\n\n534\n00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,010\nstanding your computer up, and\nyou push it too close to the wall, then\n\n535\n00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,570\nthat air that's blowing out of the back\nof it is going to be hitting the wall.\n\n536\n00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,610\nAnd it won't be able to get out of\nthe case as quickly as it could.\n\n537\n00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,480\nSo, regardless of whether it's above\nthe desk, below the desk, or wherever.\n\n538\n00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,440\nWe need to make sure that we have\ngood clearance on the front, and\n\n539\n00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,860\nback of the computer.\n\n540\n00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,010\nNow some higher end computers might\nhave additional fans on the top or\n\n541\n00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,690\neven on the bottom.\n\n542\n00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,280\nSo you always need to just take a look at\nthat, look at the outside of the case,\n\n543\n00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,900\npower it on and you know, move your hands\naround the outside, you'll feel the air so\n\n544\n00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,950\nyou can tell where it's exiting and\n\n545\n00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,130\nwhere it's entering the case and\nmake sure you leave that clear.\n\n546\n00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,000\nWhen we run our cables it's possible\nto obstruct that too and, and in\n\n547\n00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,560\nan earlier episode we talked about cable\nmanagement, using velcro or twist ties to,\n\n548\n00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,890\nto tighten all our cables up together so\nthey get out of the way to allow air flow.\n\n549\n00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,000\nAll right.\n\n550\n00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600\nOther things that we need to think about.\n\n551\n00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,020\nRon, you mentioned fans.\n\n552\n00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,960\nWell, if you put your computer on the\nfloor, it's going to be collecting dust,\n\n553\n00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,070\nand it, it doesn't matter how neat and\nclean your house is, if you have doors and\n\n554\n00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,570\nwindows that you ever open-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n555\n00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,130\n>> You'll get dust in the house.\n\n556\n00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,120\nIf you have pets,\n\n557\n00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,020\nit can actually be worse, right,cats,\ndogs they have dander that they generate.\n\n558\n00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,430\nAnd again it's not a matter of cleanliness\nalthough I guess in some cases it is, but\n\n559\n00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,820\nit's not really cleanliness,\nit's just animals shed.\n\n560\n00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,020\nIt's what they do.\n\n561\n00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,890\nAnd, and so that gets caught up,\nyour computer is sucking air in, it's\n\n562\n00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,270\nsucking debris in too, so if you've got\na lot of dust, dander, animal pet hair,\n\n563\n00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,960\nwhatever, then that actually makes\nit inside of your computer and\n\n564\n00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,255\nit can get caught up inside of your fans,\nwhich will stop them from working.\n\n565\n00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:20,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It can get caught up inside of your\n\n566\n00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,810\nheat sinks, which can reduce the, the heat\ndissipation inside of your system, and\n\n567\n00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,200\nthat can really make things,\nmake things bad.\n\n568\n00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,170\nAnd, I see this on laptops a lot,\ncuz laptops really rely on their fans.\n\n569\n00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,700\nThat they'd get a lot of, of dust and\ndebris stuck in there and\n\n570\n00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,210\nthe fans can't operate, so\nit's a good idea, once in a while,\n\n571\n00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,520\nto take a vacuum cleaner and you know,\njust put the bristle attachment on it and\n\n572\n00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520\nyou don't have to open up\nyour computer in most cases.\n\n573\n00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,690\nJust vacuum the outside of it and\n\n574\n00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,490\nyou can get a lot that dust off the fans,\nand clear up that airway.\n\n575\n00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n576\n00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,300\nIt's been colder recently here in Florida.\n\n577\n00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,680\nWhat happens now, my, my daughter's cats.\n\n578\n00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,610\nThey love getting near the back of\nthat computer at night right now.\n\n579\n00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,810\nSo they,\nthey like to crawl right behind there and\n\n580\n00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,610\njust lay right up against that thing.\n\n581\n00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,130\n>> Nice and warm.\n\n582\n00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,890\n>> And it's nice and warm, and\nit's really warm in the morning\n\n583\n00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,710\nwhen they've actually been\nthere all night cuz they're,\n\n584\n00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,310\nthey're again actually blocking some\nof the airflow that's coming out of it.\n\n585\n00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,035\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, and it's all,\n\n586\n00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:16,285\nit's stuff you've gotta consider.\n\n587\n00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,975\nSome of the other things that Comp to\ncalls out are things like humidity,\n\n588\n00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,765\ntemperature, and EMI.\n\n589\n00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,915\nWell, temperature we've\nkinda already talked about,\n\n590\n00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:28,015\nbut humidity is a big one,\ndepending on where you live, you may\n\n591\n00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:31,975\nhave an increased level of moisture\nin there than other places, right.\n\n592\n00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:34,075\nNow, what does that mean for us?\n\n593\n00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:38,180\nWell, if there's too much\nhumidity in the air, and\n\n594\n00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,080\nthe temperature does a rapid change,\nyou can end up with condensation,\n\n595\n00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,570\nwhere liquid starts to\nbuild up on surfaces.\n\n596\n00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,810\nAnd where we see this most commonly,\nare places here like Florida.\n\n597\n00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,740\nSo here in Florida we have a lot of,\nwe have a real high humidity level here.\n\n598\n00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,215\nAnd, I, I,\nit's one of the highest in the country.\n\n599\n00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:54,810\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n600\n00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,930\n>> And, when you get a brand new computer\nand they ship it via UPS, right.\n\n601\n00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,210\nAnd, and so it comes in and\nyou get it in this box and the UPS trucks,\n\n602\n00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,760\nthey're not, they're not air conditioned,\nso that computer's nice and hot.\n\n603\n00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,504\nAnd then you,\n\n604\n00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,110\nyou bring it into your house,\n>> Air conditioning.\n\n605\n00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,620\n>> Where you've got the air\nconditioning running.\n\n606\n00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,590\nAnd when that hot computer hits\nthe cool air conditioning,\n\n607\n00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,940\nit starts to condensation, and\nyou get little beads of water all over.\n\n608\n00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,530\nWater which is not very good for\n\n609\n00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,200\nelectronics, so you've gotta be\ncareful to acclimate things.\n\n610\n00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,990\nWhen you get that nice,\nnew computer box, and\n\n611\n00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,000\nif it feels hot just, don't even open it.\n\n612\n00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,800\nJust stick it in a corner of\nyour house and let it sit for\n\n613\n00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,595\n24 hours, I know it's tough to wait,\nbut just wait till the next day,\n\n614\n00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:37,953\nand that way it will slowly reach the same\ntemperature as your house instead of doing\n\n615\n00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,726\nit rapidly, and\nyou'll avoid that condensation.\n\n616\n00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:43,940\nNow the opposite is true too if\nyou have no humidity in the air.\n\n617\n00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,215\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of the problems we have is that in\n\n618\n00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:50,757\nlow humidity areas like in Arizona,\nif you live in the desert or something.\n\n619\n00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:53,717\nThere's a lot of static electricity.\n\n620\n00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:57,587\nAnd as a kid you guys probably played this\nwhere you rub your feet on the floor.\n\n621\n00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:59,877\nAnd then you walk up and you touch\nsomebody and it shocks them, right?\n\n622\n00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:03,187\nOr you rub a balloon on you're hair and\nyou stick it to the wall and it hangs\n\n623\n00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:08,390\nthere, that's static electricity and we\nall contain some to at least some degree.\n\n624\n00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:13,360\nBut in low humidity environments, it, it's\nworse than in high humidity environments,\n\n625\n00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,220\nso, why are we worried\nabout static electricity?\n\n626\n00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,180\nWell, electronic components.\n\n627\n00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,910\n>> Electronic components really can't\nstand a lot of quick electronic,\n\n628\n00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,240\nelectrical discharge right away.\n\n629\n00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,340\nAnd, what can end up happening, is it can\ndamage them, a lot of times, damage that,\n\n630\n00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,120\nwhat we're talking about doesn't have\nto take a large amount of voltage.\n\n631\n00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,255\nWhat Don was talking about\nwhere you rub the balloon, and\n\n632\n00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:40,381\nit sticks against the wall,\nthat's somewhere around 3,000 volts.\n\n633\n00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:44,471\nWhen you talk about being able to break\nsomething inside a computer, it can take\n\n634\n00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:48,683\nless ten volts, so it just isn't about\nsticking it, and now, if that's on you,\n\n635\n00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:52,798\nyou go and touch an electronic component\ninside the computer You can damage it.\n\n636\n00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,363\nSo we need to actually be able to know.\n\n637\n00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:58,095\nEspecially if we're gonna be\nentering in the IT field,\n\n638\n00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:01,000\nthat we wanna take what we call\nanti-static precautions or\n\n639\n00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,200\nelectrostatic precautions to make sure\nthat, that we don't do anything like that.\n\n640\n00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,550\n>> Yeah, that, that whole, that act of\ntouching something and shocking it?\n\n641\n00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,900\nThat's called electrostatic discharge, and\n\n642\n00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,700\nIf you're working inside of your computer\nthere's a lot of precautions you can take.\n\n643\n00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,570\nYou can wear things like\nthese ESD wrist bands.\n\n644\n00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,110\nAnd what this is, is a little wrist band,\nit's got a metal plate on it.\n\n645\n00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,373\nAnd if you're going to work on\nthe computer you put it on your wrist and\n\n646\n00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:29,360\nyou tighten it up, the hardest\npart is getting that thing snug.\n\n647\n00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,677\nBut basically you tighten it up and\n\n648\n00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:33,160\nthat will hold that little\npiece of metal on your arm.\n\n649\n00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,340\nAnd on the other end,\nit's got a little alligator clip, and\n\n650\n00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,480\nyou just attach this to\na grounded metal surface.\n\n651\n00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,440\nSo it can even be the case of the computer\nitself, if plugged in, it's grounded.\n\n652\n00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,550\nIf it's not plugged in, you might connect\nit to something else like your desk or,\n\n653\n00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,260\nor something that happens to create a,\na nice big surface.\n\n654\n00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,430\nSo that any static electricity\nyou build up in your own hand\n\n655\n00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,758\ngets discharged into the table and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n656\n00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:58,010\nSo that's kinda, a nice thing, that,\n\n657\n00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,780\nthat you do if you're going to be\nworking inside of the computer.\n\n658\n00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,290\nWhen you're working on the outside of\nthe computer, just setting up the tower,\n\n659\n00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,815\nhooking up a keyboard.\n\n660\n00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:08,317\nThere you're not really risking\ndamaging the internal components.\n\n661\n00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:11,535\nSo electrostatic discharge isn't\nsomething that you'd have to worry about\n\n662\n00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:14,505\non that side unless you're going\nto be doing internal repairs.\n\n663\n00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:20,855\nBut there is another thing called EMI,\nwhich is electro magnetic interference.\n\n664\n00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:24,245\nAnd that is basically\nthe idea that when you\n\n665\n00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:28,910\nrun any kinda electrical device it\ngenerates electromagnetic waves.\n\n666\n00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,010\nAnd, and these waves, if you have\ndifferent devices that are on near enough\n\n667\n00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,860\nthe same frequency, they can start\nto interfere with each other.\n\n668\n00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,300\nAnd so one device may cause\nproblems with another.\n\n669\n00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,560\nAnd so, we may need to separate those\nout to be able to protect from that.\n\n670\n00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,210\nAnd we see this in,\nin a number of different things.\n\n671\n00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,290\nI used to have a BlackBerry cellphone.\n\n672\n00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:53,020\nAnd when I would set it on my desk,my\ncomputer speakers would always\n\n673\n00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,690\npicked up that interference, and\nit starts making this clicking noise.\n\n674\n00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,800\nAnd I'd move the cellphone away and\nit would stop.\n\n675\n00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,990\nThat's an, an example of EMI.\n\n676\n00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,010\nThere's other things, though,\n\n677\n00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,800\nthat might not even be related\nto something in your house.\n\n678\n00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,770\nThings like solar flares from the sun,\nwhen there's a solar storm going on,\n\n679\n00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,628\nyou actually get more EMI.\n\n680\n00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:11,800\nAnd, any kinda wireless technology\nwill have it's signal degraded.\n\n681\n00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,160\nSo electricity in the air,\nit takes a lot of forms you know,\n\n682\n00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,550\nwe got static electricity, we've got EMI.\n\n683\n00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,120\nAll sorts of different things to be\naware of there that could interfere with\n\n684\n00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,850\nthe performance of any electronic,\nnot just a computer.\n\n685\n00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,580\n>> Yeah, just when you think you're safe\nbecause when you're device may not do so,\n\n686\n00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,090\nthe majority of the devices,\nat least at on the, in the United States.\n\n687\n00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,570\nIf they're gonna use some type of,\nany type of wireless, and\n\n688\n00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,060\nthey're a home device.\n\n689\n00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,750\nThey're all going to be on that\nsame 2.4 gigahertz frequency so\n\n690\n00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,320\nthey're going to be do,\nhaving that EMI interference between them.\n\n691\n00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,470\nSo so yeah, you'll, you'll see a lot of\nthose devices, whether the household or\n\n692\n00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,590\ncomputer based.\n\n693\n00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,610\nI love how you put that, Ronnie.\n\n694\n00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,905\nJust when you thought you were safe.\n\n695\n00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:50,546\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> You know,\n\n696\n00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,653\nbecause we all do live in fear of\n>> We do.\n\n697\n00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:53,651\n[LAUGH] I do.\n\n698\n00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:54,725\nI'm joking.\n\n699\n00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,790\n>> CompTIA plays it up\nto a little bit extreme.\n\n700\n00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,570\n>> That's right.\n\n701\n00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,150\n>> But, better safe than sorry.\n\n702\n00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,367\n>> Yes.\n>> Right and you know,\n\n703\n00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:01,548\nyou don't want to buy some\nnew computer component and\n\n704\n00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,844\nyou start messing with it and you fry it\njust because you had static electricity,\n\n705\n00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:06,268\nthese are things that can happen.\n\n706\n00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,520\n>> Oh yeah.\nMm-hm.\n\n707\n00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,480\nAll right, now,\nthe last part of our exam objectives for\n\n708\n00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,230\nthis one is an area called ergonomics.\n\n709\n00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,590\nAll right, and, and\nwhat is ergonomics all about?\n\n710\n00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,880\nWell, believe it or not,\nthe human body wasn't really designed for\n\n711\n00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,490\nsitting at a desk and\nusing a computer all day, right?\n\n712\n00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,250\nOur body was designed for\nthings like running, hunting,\n\n713\n00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,622\ngathering you know, whatever,\nchasing after the wooly mammoth.\n\n714\n00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:34,980\nThat's kinda the, the operation\nthat the human body's designed for.\n\n715\n00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,060\nSo, when you're sitting at a computer,\nday in, day out,\n\n716\n00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,170\nyou're just sitting there doing\nwork each hour of the day.\n\n717\n00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,540\nWell, it can actually create a small\ndegree of stress on the body.\n\n718\n00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,890\nAnd while a single day of it is not\nanything to worry about, over time,\n\n719\n00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,510\nif you use that computer for\n\n720\n00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,680\neight hours a day for years on end, that\nsmall degree of stress starts to add up.\n\n721\n00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,700\nAnd eventually,\nit can do some real damage.\n\n722\n00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,640\nSo you hear about people that have been\nlong-time computer users that now have\n\n723\n00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640\ncarpal tunnel syndrome, right?\n\n724\n00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,220\nWhich is a situation,\n\n725\n00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,010\nan inflammation in the wrist that\ncan only be corrected by surgery.\n\n726\n00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,590\nYou hear about other people\nwho have like lumbar or\n\n727\n00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,880\nlower back pains from sitting in that\noffice desk and working all day.\n\n728\n00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,880\nA lot of the, the desks, the chairs that\nwe sit in, the computer components we use.\n\n729\n00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,260\nThey, if they're positioned correctly can\nbe very ergonomic and friendly to use.\n\n730\n00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,250\nBut the way most of us just\nthrow them up there uninformed,\n\n731\n00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,650\nit can actually be doing\ndamage to your body over time.\n\n732\n00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,110\nSo we need to be aware of that and\ntake precautions.\n\n733\n00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,870\n>> Yeah, a lot of the times you hear\nthe term repetitive stress injuries\n\n734\n00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,170\nthis is what we're talking about.\n\n735\n00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,180\nThe, the position that we're in where we\nhold our hands up typing all the time,\n\n736\n00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,980\nor we're sitting in that\nchair in that same position.\n\n737\n00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,830\nOur bodies have actually stiffened that\npoint so we're sitting there in that\n\n738\n00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,640\nsame positions, we're holding our\nhands in the same positions, and\n\n739\n00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,530\nthat causes undue stress on joints.\n\n740\n00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,443\nWe're probably not supposed to have\nhappen for eight hours a day doing that.\n\n741\n00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:02,000\n>> All right.\nSo, how do we prevent that?\n\n742\n00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,490\nWell, there's a number of different ways.\n\n743\n00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,460\nSometimes when you buy equipment,\nthere are special,\n\n744\n00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,240\nergonomic versions of that equipment.\n\n745\n00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,030\nSo for example,\nI've got a keyboard pulled up here and\n\n746\n00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,320\nthis is a, a Microsoft natural,\nergonomic keyboard.\n\n747\n00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,910\n>> And, if you notice, it's got these\nnice big, cushiony pads right here.\n\n748\n00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,790\nThat's what your wrists sit on,\nnice cushions.\n\n749\n00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,190\nAnd then the keyboard is actually\ndivided down the middle so\n\n750\n00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,010\nthat your two hands can sit apart in\na more natural position to help type.\n\n751\n00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,170\nNow I absolutely hate these keyboards and\nI refuse to use them.\n\n752\n00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,680\nSo even though it's not ergonomic,\nI prefer to use the normal keyboard.\n\n753\n00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320\nBut if you can learn to use this,\nit's very comfortable and\n\n754\n00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,620\na lot people report that they can actually\ntype faster on this style of keyboard.\n\n755\n00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,250\nIt's, it's not my cup of tea but, but this\nis something that a lot of people do like.\n\n756\n00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,750\nSame thing with your chairs when\nyou purchase an office chair\n\n757\n00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,500\nthere will be ergonomic chairs.\n\n758\n00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,930\nNow ergonomic chairs\nare a little bit tougher.\n\n759\n00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,860\nWhen it comes to a keyboard,\nall human beings have two hands and\n\n760\n00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,360\nthe positioning of your hands\nare pretty much gonna be the same.\n\n761\n00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,240\nSo they can create one keyboard\nthat fits everybody's needs, but\n\n762\n00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,270\na chair is different.\n\n763\n00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,690\nEverybody has different body types,\ndifferent arrangements.\n\n764\n00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,070\nAnd so, they have special chairs that\nhave all sorts of customizations.\n\n765\n00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,040\nLet me see if I can find one real\nquick like a good ergonomic,\n\n766\n00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,330\nif I can spell it, ergonomic chair.\n\n767\n00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:27,430\nAnd, they're usually pretty easy to spot,\nbecause they'll have a Shop, well I guess-\n\n768\n00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,115\n>> No, you did.\n\n769\n00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:29,050\n>> Whatever.\nI'm shopping now.\n\n770\n00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,670\n>> Oh there you go.\n\n771\n00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,610\n>> But their, their usually easy to spot\nbecause you'll notice they have a lot more\n\n772\n00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,500\nlittle knobs and\nlevers than a normal chair.\n\n773\n00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,150\nMost normal chairs when you sit in them\nthey have a lever that lets them go\n\n774\n00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,000\nIt can go up or down, and that's about it.\n\n775\n00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,710\nBut an ergonomic chair will have\nadditional levers that let you tailor\n\n776\n00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,890\nthese seats angle of inclination.\n\n777\n00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,160\nSome people prefer their\nchair to lean forward a bit.\n\n778\n00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,070\nSome prefer it to lean back a bit.\n\n779\n00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,700\nThe back, you might be able to raise or\nlower the back,\n\n780\n00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500\nas well as adjust its angle.\n\n781\n00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,900\nSome of them even have a knob, like this\none does, that can make the lumbar, that,\n\n782\n00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,840\nthat little, small of your back\narea push out or back, based again,\n\n783\n00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,950\non your personal body structure.\n\n784\n00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,590\nAnd if you get one of these chairs,\nthey're normally a little bit on\n\n785\n00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,780\nthe pricey side, to have the full\nergonomic capabilities like this one here.\n\n786\n00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,970\nYou'll see,\nlike I can get this chair for 100 bucks.\n\n787\n00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,276\nBut this one, 570 and\nthis is an ergonomic chair.\n\n788\n00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:21,140\nLook at all the different things\nwe can adjust on this guy.\n\n789\n00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,900\nCan I make that bigger?\n\n790\n00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,790\nWow, that's not really any bigger at all,\nis it?\n\n791\n00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There, that's some what bigger.\n\n792\n00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,880\nBut you can see it's got that\nseparate head rest that can be moved.\n\n793\n00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,340\nYou've got this giant knob here for\nadjusting the back.\n\n794\n00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,540\nThe lumbar, you can see where that can\ncome up and back to meet the curve of\n\n795\n00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,610\nyour back, the chair, all of these\ndifferent little pieces are adjustable.\n\n796\n00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,317\nIt's an expensive chair, but\nif you're going to be sitting in that\n\n797\n00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:48,706\nthing eight hours a day,\n40 hours a week for years and years.\n\n798\n00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:53,526\nYou need a chair that matches your body\nneeds and it does make a difference.\n\n799\n00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:56,845\nYou will have a more comfortable\nexperience if the chair has been\n\n800\n00:39:56,845 --> 00:40:00,288\ncustomized to you No just having\nan ergonomic chair is not enough,\n\n801\n00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:01,468\nyou need to adjust it.\n\n802\n00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,774\nAnd so\nit will normally come with a manual or\n\n803\n00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:08,060\ninstructions to walk you through how\nto tailor each individual piece.\n\n804\n00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,510\nAnd getting that right alignment,\nis the real important part,\n\n805\n00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,620\neven on a cheap chair we can correct our,\nour ergonomics a good bit.\n\n806\n00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,720\nIn the United States we have\na government agency called OSHA,\n\n807\n00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,040\nthe Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration.\n\n808\n00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600\nIt's part of the Department of Labor, and\n\n809\n00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,940\nthey publish all the Ergonomics documents\nfor the, the United States government.\n\n810\n00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,235\nAnd they've got a great website, even if\nyou're not not here in the United States.\n\n811\n00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:36,150\nIt's got a great website if you don't\nthink about things like web design.\n\n812\n00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it looks pretty bad,\n\n813\n00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:40,775\nbut but the information they\nprovide is really handy, so\n\n814\n00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:44,420\nthey break down all the information\nabout ergonomics, why it's important.\n\n815\n00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,220\nWhy, if you, if you have already\nbeen damaged by body stress,\n\n816\n00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,330\nwhy you can get your doctors to cover\nit in insurance,uh, so they tell all\n\n817\n00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,740\nsorts of information about that, but\nthe really useful part is this right here.\n\n818\n00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,150\nThey have a whole breakdown on computer\nwork stations, well I'll post the link to\n\n819\n00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,990\nthis with the show notes, but they\nbreak down all of those pain points and\n\n820\n00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,190\nthis diagram can just, let me see if I\ncan make that maybe a little bigger.\n\n821\n00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,570\nLet's see if we can zoom in on,\non this lady trying to work here.\n\n822\n00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,050\nThere we go.\n\n823\n00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,880\nSo it's not the greatest\npicture in the world but\n\n824\n00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,060\nbasically it's showing the pain points\nthat a normal person will have while using\n\n825\n00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,690\na computer, and what you want is you\nwant somebody to be able to sit in\n\n826\n00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,680\nan upright position where\nthey're comfortable.\n\n827\n00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,640\nAnd she's had this chair adjusted.\n\n828\n00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,690\nSee how her, her angle here with her legs\nis basically creating a 90 degree angle?\n\n829\n00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,490\nThat's what you want,\nif you're sitting at some kind of a slope,\n\n830\n00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,150\nthen that's gonna create stress on your\nlegs cuz you're basically leaning forward.\n\n831\n00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,200\nOr if it's too high, it's creating\nstress on your you're gluteous maximus,\n\n832\n00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,060\nthe old rump, because, if you know, you're\nputting all your pressure back there,\n\n833\n00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,030\nyou're not putting pressure\non your thighs, so\n\n834\n00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,190\nwe want our legs to be parallel with our\nsitting position, parallel with the floor.\n\n835\n00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,420\nAnd so raising and lowering the seat\nheight is what takes care of that, and you\n\n836\n00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,310\nwant your back to be able to fit into the\ncontour of the chair so that you're body\n\n837\n00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:10,240\nis perpendicular with the ground, right\nand an adjustable seat that does that.\n\n838\n00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,390\nYou want your arms, to rest at\na natural position, moving forward,\n\n839\n00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,000\nsee how her elbow is on the arm rest and\n\n840\n00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,520\nthen her arms basically come straight\nforward to the keyboard, so it's a natural\n\n841\n00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,550\nposition and adjusting those arm rests is\nwhat creates that as well as her keyboard.\n\n842\n00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,170\nSee how the keyboard is on\na tray that can go up and down?\n\n843\n00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,540\nSo she's adjusting the chair and\nthe keyboard to find the perfect mix.\n\n844\n00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,660\nAnd her desk does something a lot of\npeople's don't, and it's a great idea.\n\n845\n00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,220\nIt's got where the keyboard\nis separate from the monitor,\n\n846\n00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,210\ntwo different disks, right.\n\n847\n00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,190\nBecause the monitor,\nneeds to be raised up and\n\n848\n00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,350\nher's in this scenario is\nactually not exactly perfect.\n\n849\n00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,680\nShe's having to look down, to look at\nthe monitor, she's having to look down.\n\n850\n00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,460\nAnd when you do that, looking down all day\nlong, that creates stress on the neck,\n\n851\n00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,890\nright, you're looking in\nan unnatural position.\n\n852\n00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,160\nYou need to raise the monitors up, so\nthat you're looking straight forward,\n\n853\n00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,450\nyou want your monitors to be at eye level,\nand her's aren't, right?\n\n854\n00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,680\nSo that's kind of what they're showing\nhere, is we wanna get things positioned\n\n855\n00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,750\nand it actually says, top of monitor\nis just below eye level that's yes.\n\n856\n00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,930\n>> Or, I don't know.\n\n857\n00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,150\n>> Strange.\n\n858\n00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,290\nBut at or just below eye level.\n\n859\n00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,920\nYeah you normally want to be at eye level\nbut I guess they're going with the or,\n\n860\n00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,870\nor below thing.\n\n861\n00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:25,500\nBut again that's for neck comfort, I've\nworked in data centers before with the,\n\n862\n00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,730\nthe monitors were always at the top\nof the racks and so I'd go and\n\n863\n00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,330\nI'd have to look up like this.\n\n864\n00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:35,400\nSo all day I'm standing here looking up\nand, and, I, I know, I look goofy, but\n\n865\n00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,330\nbut I wouldn't think about it while I was\ndoing it, but by the time I got home, my\n\n866\n00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,780\ncalves would hurt, my back would hurt, cuz\nI was basically leaning back all day long.\n\n867\n00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,360\nIt's just not a natural position.\n\n868\n00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,595\nIf you do it long enough,\nyour body will probably adjust, but, but\n\n869\n00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,330\nif you do it every now and\nthen, it, it it hurts.\n\n870\n00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,015\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n871\n00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:51,345\nwe need to be able to adjust\nour equipment to match that.\n\n872\n00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:55,101\nAnd ergonomics, it's, it, it's something\nthat, I know I've been guilty of making\n\n873\n00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,518\nfun of it a good bit,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n874\n00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:58,348\n>> But but it is a serious thing,\n\n875\n00:43:58,348 --> 00:44:01,064\na lot of people do have\nhealth concerns with that and\n\n876\n00:44:01,064 --> 00:44:05,862\nyou don't wanna damage yourself for life\njust cuz you were at work, right, we, we,\n\n877\n00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:08,740\nwe, we work to live, right,\nwe don't live to work.\n\n878\n00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,280\nI think is the, the saying.\n\n879\n00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,770\nBut, another thing I like on\nOsha's website is they have a nice\n\n880\n00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,840\nlittle checklist.\n\n881\n00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840\nIf you're just settling\nin to a new office,\n\n882\n00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,850\nthey have this computer work station\nchecklist you can run down and\n\n883\n00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,980\nthey basically tell you, right,\nlet's check our head and neck, right?\n\n884\n00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,000\nAre we arranged so we don't have to bend,\nand you just check these off,\n\n885\n00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,240\nyou just go down the line and\nwhen you find one you don't match up with,\n\n886\n00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,850\nyou need to take a corrective action.\n\n887\n00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,490\nSo they lay all that out.\n\n888\n00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,840\nIt's not pretty, but it's very effective.\n\n889\n00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,250\nThis is a good list,\nas far as laying that out, and again,\n\n890\n00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,642\nI'll post the links with the episode.\n\n891\n00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:41,740\nAll right, so,\nthose are all important things for\n\n892\n00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,820\ncreating good comfort and proper computer\nuse and not just at work but at home too.\n\n893\n00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,140\nAll right, and the absolute last entry for\nthis section, is probably one of the most\n\n894\n00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,490\nimportant ones, which just says,\nfollow the manufacture safety guidelines.\n\n895\n00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,113\nWhen you buy a computer,\na printer, a cell phone,\n\n896\n00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:03,407\na, a keyboard, they will always\ncome with a safety manual, and\n\n897\n00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,217\nmost of us just throw it in the trash and\nlaugh about it.\n\n898\n00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n899\n00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,029\n>> I'm guilty of that.\n\n900\n00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:08,653\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n901\n00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,923\nif you crack it open and read it, it will\nexplain, the ergonomics, the disposal,\n\n902\n00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:14,940\nall the different things we just\ntalked about in this section.\n\n903\n00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,250\nIt'll say all that same information,\nbut specifically for that device.\n\n904\n00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,820\nAnd that's the one you want to live by.\n\n905\n00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,590\nThey know,\nthey're the ones who made the device, so\n\n906\n00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,090\nthey're the ones who understand how to\nproperly use it, and dispose of it.\n\n907\n00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,250\nAll right, well,\n\n908\n00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,890\nRonnie, I think that wraps up our\nenvironmental and safety section.\n\n909\n00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,090\nCan you think of anything\nelse to throw in?\n\n910\n00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,840\n>> I cannot think of anything else to\nthrow in, and not only does it wrap\n\n911\n00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,790\nup that, particular section,\nit wraps up all of IT fundamentals.\n\n912\n00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,660\nFor our show.\n\n913\n00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,510\n>> That's right.\nSo,\n\n914\n00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,480\nobjective 5.5 is the final\none in the exam outline.\n\n915\n00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,100\nSo that's pretty much it.\n\n916\n00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,020\nAt this point,\nyou've completed all the shows you've see,\n\n917\n00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,480\nall the topics that we're gonna be\ncovered, or that are covered on the exam.\n\n918\n00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,270\nIf all of that made sense to you,\nif we did not shock you with\n\n919\n00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,070\nany new information,\nthen get in that testing booth.\n\n920\n00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,260\nJump on in there and take that exam,\nyou are ready to get certified.\n\n921\n00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,820\nIf, that was new and shocking, you learned\na few things and hopefully you did.\n\n922\n00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,340\nRight.\n\n923\n00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,840\nThen make sure you're comfortable with it,\nand we'll post show notes for\n\n924\n00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,470\nall the episodes with the
