show host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:22.225\nwe are starting our new mini series on\ngetting technical with the terminal.\n\n5\n00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:26.415\nAnd here to help us, tell us all about\nwhat the terminal is, is the one and\n\n6\n00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:27.975\nonly Mr. Justin Dennis.\n\n7\n00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.195\nAnd hello, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.325\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:31.200\nHow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, and I'm really\nexcited to start this little series.\n\n11\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.300\nI know we got a couple episodes, but\n\n12\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.740\nwe're starting at the very beginning right\nnow, and so I have a question for you.\n\n13\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.070\nWhat is the terminal?\n\n14\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Well that is a great leading question\nbecause, well, that's why we're here today\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.760\nbecause over the next few episodes\nwe're gonna learn how to use it.\n\n16\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.100\nBut before we can learn how to use it,\nwe should probably learn what it is.\n\n17\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.110\nNow we're not gonna necessarily\nbe using the computer too much,\n\n18\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.390\nI just wanna give you some back story.\n\n19\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.790\nI wanna clarify some terminology,\n\n20\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.990\nmainly because I tend to be\na little cavalier when I speak.\n\n21\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.815\nAnd I do that because I know that\nother people are cavalier, and so\n\n22\n00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.910\nyou'll hear the terminology a lot\nof the times a way I use it.\n\n23\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.590\nIf you're a systems admin watching this,\nthen you might grit your teeth.\n\n24\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.376\nBut that's all right, because we're\ndevelopers, and we tend to be a little,\n\n25\n00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:25.081\na little off the cuff, so to speak.\n\n26\n00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:27.495\n&gt;&gt; It's always good to\nstart off with vocabulary.\n\n27\n00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:31.845\nAnd like you say, I do the same thing,\nthere's a technical definition and\n\n28\n00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:36.815\na real way I'm supposed to talk\nabout this, but I tend to use my own\n\n29\n00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:42.615\nlanguage or\nnot really use it too the letter, per se.\n\n30\n00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.532\nAnd so that's why I always start off a lot\nof my shows with, let me tell you what,\n\n31\n00:01:46.532 --> 00:01:50.370\nthis is the real thing, but\nI'm gonna keep referring to it as x.\n\n32\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.600\n&gt;&gt; And full disclosure,\nthis is not an exhaustive treatment,\n\n33\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.590\nbut this is just to give you a little bit\nof back story to understand, well whoa,\n\n34\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.040\nwhat we're going to be doing\nin the subsequent episodes.\n\n35\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.350\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen.\n\n36\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.030\nI actually have a, I don't do these a lot,\nbut this is a nice little talk.\n\n37\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.510\nI should always step outside of my comfort\nzone, as well as you should as well.\n\n38\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.770\nThat was a little redundant,\nbut that's all right.\n\n39\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.060\nJust to make things work.\n\n40\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.345\nIt's almost like me and Vonne planned the\nquestion, and totally coincidental though.\n\n41\n00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what is a terminal?\n\n42\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.780\nIt is a tool of many names, now keep\nthat in mind as I further discuss.\n\n43\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.230\nBut let's back up.\n\n44\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.260\nWhy do I say terminal?\n\n45\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.190\nWell the terminal used to be how you\ninteracted with mainframe systems and\n\n46\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.460\nother systems, and it was a physical\ndevice, kind of like the one shown\n\n47\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.390\nin this picture here, that you logged on\nand kinda [SOUND ], and you did things.\n\n48\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.620\n&gt;&gt; And didn't they call\nthose like dummy terminals?\n\n49\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.910\nYou're not on the machine itself,\nyou're just on this little\n\n50\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.860\nsatellite machine that`s connected\nto a big machine over there.\n\n51\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.990\n&gt;&gt; And those can definitely occur, yes.\n\n52\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times for\n\n53\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.110\nthese larger computers, when computers\nwere like the size of rooms, then\n\n54\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.740\nthat was probably the case, and you kinda\njust pecked away, and you issued commands.\n\n55\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.700\nAnd now these commands were built in and\nrun through what is known as a shell.\n\n56\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.860\nA shell is the layer between the actual\nhardware and kernel space and user space.\n\n57\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.950\nNow what do I mean by kernel space and\nuser space?\n\n58\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.910\nWell, kernel space,\nthe kernel is like a center,\n\n59\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.020\nthe goodness within these systems,\nRAM operating systems that had these\n\n60\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.980\ncore set of functionalities that\nwere running behind the scenes.\n\n61\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.710\nUser space, though, you don't want to go\nin there and go, well, let me turn this\n\n62\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.650\nswitch off, and this switch on, and\nthis switch off, and this switch on.\n\n63\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.920\nNow I can see what's on the hard disk,\nright?\n\n64\n00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.330\nYou don't want to do that.\n\n65\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.960\nSo it's exposed into users\nspace through the shell,\n\n66\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.150\nthe interface,\nhow we interact with those two regions.\n\n67\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.235\nWe interact through user\nspace into kernel space, so\n\n68\n00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:03.149\nwe issue commands [SOUND],\nand well things happen.\n\n69\n00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.215\nSo this is technically a terminal,\nhowever,\n\n70\n00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:10.968\nbefore we talk more about the vocabulary,\n\n71\n00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:15.918\nlet's back up and\ntalk a little bit about those shells.\n\n72\n00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:19.070\nSo first generation shells\nwere fairly simplistic,\n\n73\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.760\nthere were only a few\ncommands that you could use.\n\n74\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.810\nAnd the two prominent ones, there's\na whole bunch of these, and I actually use\n\n75\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.000\na few next gen or\nlatest generation that are alternatives,\n\n76\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.610\nwas the Mashey, could be saying\nthat wrong, and the Thompson shell.\n\n77\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.980\nThese were very, they were very strict,\n\n78\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.740\nvery limited in their use, and because\nthey were so limited, people were like,\n\n79\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.620\nyou know what, we actually need\na little more in functionality.\n\n80\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.050\nWe need a little more capabilities to\ninteract with the underlying operating\n\n81\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.830\nsystem and hardware.\n\n82\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.000\nAnd well we had the Bourne shell, and\n\n83\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.190\nif you haven't noticed these are a lot\nof times named after individuals.\n\n84\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.110\nSo the Bourne shell,\nwhich a lot of times is just sh,\n\n85\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.330\nyou see sh, that's how I've seen it.\n\n86\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.790\nI'm not saying that is\nabsolutely always the case,\n\n87\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.900\nthere may be alternative shells that are\nalso called sh depending on your system.\n\n88\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.030\nAnd then there was the C shell.\n\n89\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.960\nNow, I'm gonna stop here\nat the second gen, and\n\n90\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.650\nthese were supposed to be\nimprovements on the previous slide,\n\n91\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.450\nthe Mashey and the Thompson cell, shell,\nnot cell, that's totally different.\n\n92\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.120\nThese two come along because you\nneed a little more programmability,\n\n93\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.188\nyou need a little more customizability,\nyou need a little more capabilities.\n\n94\n00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:47.210\nAnd well, these came along, and\nC shell was actually modeled,\n\n95\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.390\nyou'll see that abbreviated as csh, was\nmodeled after the C programming language,\n\n96\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.902\nyou could extend it by writing custom\nfunctions, little routines, and things.\n\n97\n00:05:56.902 --> 00:06:02.130\nAnd at this time,\nC shell far outweighed the capabilities,\n\n98\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.010\njust because of the customizability for\n\n99\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.620\nprogrammers, being able to change things,\nthan the Bourne shell.\n\n100\n00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.350\nBut it still wasn't enough, and\npeople started getting traction, and\n\n101\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.960\nthey're like, well it'd be cool if it\ncould do this and that, and this and that.\n\n102\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.770\nAnd there were still limitations, and I'm\nkind of lumping these all together, these\n\n103\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.890\nare not necessarily all occurring at the\nsame time, these are still a progression.\n\n104\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.830\nBut I wanted to give you an overview.\n\n105\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.770\nWe had the Tenex C-shell, tcsh, we had\nthe Bourne Again shell, which is bash.\n\n106\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.020\nSo it's funny that the Bourne shell,\nand they did a play on words, and\n\n107\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.680\nit's the Bourne Again Shell,\nso that's abbreviated bash.\n\n108\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.720\n&gt;&gt; Wait, because I hear you\nguys talk about, you and\n\n109\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.230\nDaniel are always talking about bash,\nand that's what it stands for.\n\n110\n00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Bourne Again Shell.\n\n111\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.740\nOkay, now I have a little history of what\nyou all are talking about at the office.\n\n112\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.530\nAnd I just go, Bash?\n\n113\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.155\nI'm thinking like you're\nbashing something.\n\n114\n00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.311\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n115\n00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:06.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Bash, it does roll off the tongue,\n\n116\n00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.840\nand it has a fair amount of capabilities,\nand this is kind of a standard.\n\n117\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.000\nIf you're in a Mac or a Linux system,\n\n118\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.280\na lot of times this is the default\nshell that is available to you, bash.\n\n119\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.970\nBash offers a fair amount of capabilities.\n\n120\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.320\nThere are also other shells like Z-shell,\n\n121\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.980\nwhich is, you can do everything that bash\ncan do, Z-shell more or less can do.\n\n122\n00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.640\nBut then there's additional things,\nlike, well I can\n\n123\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.070\neasily alias, I have a little bit\ndifferent ways to customize how it looks.\n\n124\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.140\nLike I have a z-shell installation\nthat has like clouds for the,\n\n125\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.780\non a command line interface,\nwhich is usually just this black box.\n\n126\n00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.295\nAnd so\nthere's some nice customizability, and\n\n127\n00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:56.308\nZ-shell also supports some newer things,\nlike images.\n\n128\n00:07:56.308 --> 00:08:00.660\nYou can actually mess around with\nimages on the actual shell prompt,\n\n129\n00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.850\nand it will display them.\n\n130\n00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.080\nNow there are some assumptions there.\n\n131\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.920\nIt is more or less a preference\nonce you get to these three areas.\n\n132\n00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.700\nAnd the final one is a fish shell.\n\n133\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.900\nI haven't used that one a great deal, but\n\n134\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.450\nit is very similar in its purpose for\nZ-shell.\n\n135\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.880\nIt offers some extended capabilities,\nand at this point, it's more about\n\n136\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:30.290\nwhat you want, your preference than\nnecessarily a difference of capabilities.\n\n137\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.070\n&gt;&gt; And just to make sure I'm following, so\nwe have the shell is what we're going to\n\n138\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.530\nbe using to talk to the hardware and\ngive it commands.\n\n139\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nWe're gonna kind of proxy through\n\n140\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.950\nthe operating system using the shell,\nand it's gonna do stuff, and\n\n141\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.900\nit may look at our hard drive,\nit may look at our network connections,\n\n142\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.800\nit may just tinker around on our hardware.\n\n143\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.564\n&gt;&gt; Based on what we tell it to do.\n\n144\n00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:54.741\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n145\n00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:56.541\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so the shell is the forward facing\n\n146\n00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:58.750\npart that you are interacting with.\n\n147\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.190\nWell, inside a terminal you are like,\nhold up Justin.\n\n148\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.830\nThere's a terminal on my computer?\n\n149\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.520\nWell, for the most part,\n\n150\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.410\nthere's terminal-like things, more\nspecifically, there's a terminal emulator.\n\n151\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.510\nAll right, it's not a physical little\nchunk box that you carry around in\n\n152\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.520\na briefcase, those days are long gone.\n\n153\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.090\nYou have something that emulates\nthat machine that runs the shell\n\n154\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.970\nthat you can interact through alright.\n\n155\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.340\nSo terminal emulators,\nyou may have encountered them and\n\n156\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.370\ndidn't even know that you\nwere encountering them.\n\n157\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.826\nTerminal emulators,\nwe have things like terminator,\n\n158\n00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:41.565\nKonsole with a K, Terminal,\nConEmu, Gnome-terminal,\n\n159\n00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:46.521\niTerm2, Commander, guake,\nthere's also Kuake with a K.\n\n160\n00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:51.207\nThey have fancy names, but effectively\nwhat they're trying to do is give you\n\n161\n00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:55.604\naccess to a shell program that you can\ninteract with, and it behaves like\n\n162\n00:09:55.604 --> 00:10:00.830\nthe terminal computer of old days of your,\nbut it's actually on your computer.\n\n163\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.580\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwould these be considered applications?\n\n164\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.530\nIt's a program on your computer,\njust like Word, or\n\n165\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:14.580\nText Editor, it's a program, and\nit is emulating the terminal?\n\n166\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.950\n&gt;&gt; Exaclty, so it is to provide you with\nthe same interface, it is an application,\n\n167\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.930\nand it provides the interface to\nthe shell so you can interact with it.\n\n168\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.080\nNow here's where I'm gonna stop and\nback up.\n\n169\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.270\nI said, what is the terminal?\n\n170\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.630\nVonne asked, what is the terminal?\n\n171\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.800\nTechnically, the terminal is this square\nlittle box that was a physical machine,\n\n172\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.870\nthe interface to something else,\nusing a shell, on our computers,\n\n173\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.330\nyours, mine, Vonne's, everybody who\nhave seen any of these programs.\n\n174\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.720\nAnd yes,\nWindows has some of these by default,\n\n175\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.170\nif you've ever seen little screens\npop up during an installation,\n\n176\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.750\neven if you've never actually got on it,\ncommand prompt\n\n177\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.320\nis technically a terminal environment\nthat gives you access to a shell.\n\n178\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.590\nPowerShell opens up in\na terminal emulator to show you,\n\n179\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.570\nI can type commands that\nare Microsoft specific.\n\n180\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:12.820\nSo all of those, and I actually forgot,\nI have a little bit of a bias.\n\n181\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.400\nI forgot to include PowerShell\nin the shells, that's on me,\n\n182\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.760\nlittle extra for you, but\nall of those are terminal emulators.\n\n183\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.870\nBut, from here on out, I will probably\nsay terminal because a lot of other\n\n184\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:34.500\npeople will say open the terminal, or open\nthe console, or open the command line.\n\n185\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.650\nThese are all synonyms.\n\n186\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.000\nTechnically we are opening a terminal\nemulator, but you're gonna hear terminal,\n\n187\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.580\ncommand line, or the console or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n188\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.560\nThere's a few other ones\nthat are edge cases,\n\n189\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.060\njust be aware, if you're confused,\nask for clarity about what someone means.\n\n190\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.767\nWhen you say console,\ndo you mean the terminal application or\n\n191\n00:11:56.767 --> 00:12:01.730\nthe terminal emulator on my computer,\nlike Command Prompt or PowerShell?\n\n192\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.429\nAlthough, it's called a PowerShell,\nbut PowerShell is the shell, but\n\n193\n00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:07.448\nit's actually in a window that is the\nterminal emulator, [SOUND] naming's hard.\n\n194\n00:12:07.448 --> 00:12:08.266\nThat's important to know.\n\n195\n00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's also very windows-like.\n\n196\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.740\nWindows like to really mess the waters\nup with using the same names for\n\n197\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.260\ndifferent things.\n\n198\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.630\nAnd when you were talking about like\ninstalling a program on a windows machine,\n\n199\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.540\nI'm a Mac girl, I mean, I have a Mac,\nbut I use both systems, and\n\n200\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.370\nI'm like, yeah, I always see those\nlittle boxes that would pop up and\n\n201\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:36.330\nlooked very computery-like with some,\nlooks like little characters or what.\n\n202\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.860\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n203\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.240\nAnd going to the start, run,\nedit, and then typing in CMD for\n\n204\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.650\ncommand line on a windows machine,\nthat would be terminal Emulator.\n\n205\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and a lot of times,\npeople just say, open the command prompt.\n\n206\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's because you're issuing\n\n207\n00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.760\ncommands through that shell interface\n\n208\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.040\nin that terminal emulator application\nthat is also called Command Prompt.\n\n209\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n210\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.750\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of a weird thing.\n\n211\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.130\n&gt;&gt; Rather than going through\nthe actual operating system,\n\n212\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.150\nlike the GUI interface of going to\nthis window, and clicking this button\n\n213\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.220\nthat has a little picture on it, and it's\ngonna do something, like print your paper.\n\n214\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.680\nThat is a command,\nwe're just doing it through the graphical\n\n215\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.130\nuser interface of that operating system,\nrather than going to the command line,\n\n216\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.380\ntyping in a bunch of code,\nthat's gonna do the same thing.\n\n217\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n218\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.180\nA lot of times we can do things both ways,\nand actually interestingly enough,\n\n219\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.060\nthis series is just about that,\ngetting you,\n\n220\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.190\nstarting familiarity with,\nwell if I'm looking at my computer, and\n\n221\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.790\nI open up this little black box typically,\nsometimes they're not necessarily black,\n\n222\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.070\nthey have theming,\neverybody loves to customize things.\n\n223\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.210\nOn mac and all Linux flavors, mac for\n\n224\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.260\nsure, Linux gets a little hairy from\ntime to time, you are going to open up\n\n225\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.510\na terminal emulator, and\nit is gonna give you a Bash shell.\n\n226\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.840\nAnd it's gonna look very similar to this,\n\n227\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.150\nyou're gonna have a little command prompt,\nand then that's it.\n\n228\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.560\nWe're gonna learn how to get basic\nproficiency with those in order to, well,\n\n229\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.780\nexpedite some of our processes.\n\n230\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.670\nBut also there are times where\nyou don't have a GUI to click,\n\n231\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.660\nand you have to know how to look around,\nhow to make things happen.\n\n232\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.490\nAnd well, we're just starting our journey,\n\n233\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.050\nand that's ultimately what\nwe're striving to do.\n\n234\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.100\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n235\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.260\nSo Bash seems to have won the shell war,\nif you wanna say,\n\n236\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.290\nwhen it comes to the Macintosh,\nand like you said, kind of Linux.\n\n237\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.700\nBut Bash would not be on\na Windows machine or could you do,\n\n238\n00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.923\nor is that getting\na little too in the weeds?\n\n239\n00:14:47.923 --> 00:14:55.303\n&gt;&gt; So it's funny, there are, and\nactually if you are running Cygwin or\n\n240\n00:14:55.303 --> 00:15:00.395\nMinGW, M-I-N-G-W or C-Y-G-W-I-N,\n\n241\n00:15:00.395 --> 00:15:06.250\nthose are both Linux emulators\nthat provide a terminal\n\n242\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.640\nemulator interface to run Bash on Windows.\n\n243\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so hold on.\n\n244\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; My nose is not bleeding.\n\n245\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.730\n&gt;&gt; I had to like go through the hops,\nbut they're just simulators for\n\n246\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.790\nthis particular operating system.\n\n247\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:26.480\nBut we kind of made it work for\nyou guys on Windows, so you can play and\n\n248\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.584\nbe part of the party, but\nyou're not like a native Windows shell.\n\n249\n00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:33.895\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n250\n00:15:33.895 --> 00:15:38.010\nTypically you're gonna have Power Shell or\nthe Command Prompt shell,\n\n251\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.786\nI'm not entirely sure what\nthat one's called, but\n\n252\n00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:45.150\nI tend to not on Windows a great deal,\nfull disclosure.\n\n253\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.300\nBut in addition to that, Windows in recent\nat the time of this recording in recent\n\n254\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.280\ntimes has exposed what they\ncall the Linux Subsystem.\n\n255\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.720\nSo I can actually go turn on some\nexperimental features that may be more\n\n256\n00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.700\nstreamline now, and\nI can get Linux running\n\n257\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.620\nkind of in the background slash on\ntop of my windows installation, and\n\n258\n00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.120\nI still get a Bash shell, so\nI can actually get more of a native feel.\n\n259\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.750\nIt's really weird, but it is possible.\n\n260\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.948\nAnd one final thought, when I say Linux\nand Mac OS or OSX, I guess it's Mac OS\n\n261\n00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:25.836\nnow, underneath and behind the covers,\nthey're both based on Unix.\n\n262\n00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:31.255\nSo Mac OS is running a Unix, don't quote\nme on that, I think it's free BSD Unix,\n\n263\n00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:36.598\nnot entirely sure about that cuz Vonne and\nI have talked about this great a deal,\n\n264\n00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:41.060\nsometimes when you go, I know for\nsure and you go to say it out loud,\n\n265\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.930\nthen you immediately go,\nI don't know if I'm for sure.\n\n266\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.560\nBut it is a UNIX that is\nrunning under the covers, and\n\n267\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.210\nLinux is also based on those, so\nyou kinda have the same environment.\n\n268\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.360\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I've always heard, and\n\n269\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.080\nI've used it not fully\nunderstanding what I was saying.\n\n270\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.960\nI'm like, yeah,\nwe'll they're on the same kernel,\n\n271\n00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.660\nlike they have that same underlying under\nthe hood, it's like the same engine.\n\n272\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.255\nIt's just in a silver body versus a gold\nbody, but they're not the same as Windows.\n\n273\n00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:17.130\nWindows' underlying engine is completely\ndifferent than the Linux and OS.\n\n274\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.190\nAnd so I was like yeah,\nthey're on the same kernel.\n\n275\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.030\nLook at me talking all tech-y.\n\n276\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n277\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.280\nultimately, you're absolutely correct.\n\n278\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.710\nLinux and Mac OS are kinda the same,\nThere's even still some UNIX things, BSDs.\n\n279\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.240\nThose are all, more or less,\n\n280\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.280\ngonna have a similar interface when\nyou open that terminal emulator.\n\n281\n00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.450\nWindows, you can make it work, you might\nget different things, depending on what\n\n282\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.670\nyou're opening, whether it's PowerShell or\nany of those other programs.\n\n283\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.520\nBut now we know what we are actually going\nto be interacting with during this series,\n\n284\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.570\nand don't be afraid, I will be very\nclear about what is destructive,\n\n285\n00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.828\nif it is, and a lot of times its not,\nit is just scary.\n\n286\n00:17:55.828 --> 00:17:58.880\nSo we're gonna learn how\nto become more productive,\n\n287\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.460\nbut also start dipping our\ntoes into the unfamiliar and\n\n288\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.270\nremove ourselves from the comfort zone and\nstart our journey of growth, I guess.\n\n289\n00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, I always love starting\nwith a history lesson.\n\n290\n00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.390\nI love to know kind of the little bit of\nthe backstory even if I don't need to know\n\n291\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:20.360\nthe whole story, just enough to be like,\nokay, now it all makes sense.\n\n292\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.370\nAnd I understand what bash means,\nand I can actually know the acronym,\n\n293\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.430\nI've already forgotten the acronym.\n\n294\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.980\nBut at least I understand a little bit\nmore of what you guys are talking about.\n\n295\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.680\nAnd it sounds like that means that you\nguys are going to start understanding\n\n296\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.370\na little bit more about what this guy\nis saying, which is very exciting.\n\n297\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.980\nSo I look forward to our future episodes,\nbut\n\n298\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.790\nI think this is the time\nto wrap this one up.\n\n299\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.440\nSigning off for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n300\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n301\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.638\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n302\n00:18:46.638 --> 00:18:52.320\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:18.580\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n4\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.705\nIn today's episode we're going\nto be opening the terminal.\n\n5\n00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:24.995\nSounds like a good place to start, when\nwe're getting technical with the terminal.\n\n6\n00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:27.145\nAnd here to help us is Mr.\nJustin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:28.725\nHello, how are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.297\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Vonne, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:32.750\nhow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing all right, you know?\n\n10\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.590\nTrying to get the words out of my mouth,\n\n11\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.875\nto be able to talk to you about\nthe terminal in this show.\n\n12\n00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is definitely\n\n13\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.920\nan important thing.\n\n14\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.880\nGetting the words out of your mouth can\nbe a little iffy from time to time.\n\n15\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.030\nI have trouble with it as well, but\nhopefully things will go smoothly.\n\n16\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.810\nAnd yeah, right, in the previous episode,\nwe talked about what the terminal is.\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.860\nAnd I'm going to stick with that terminal,\ninstead of saying terminal emulator,\n\n18\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.380\nor shell.\n\n19\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.019\nBut do keep in mind,\nthere are some nuances,\n\n20\n00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.110\nsome idiosyncrasies involved\nwhen I say the word terminal.\n\n21\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.880\nNow, also, I'm in a Mac environment.\n\n22\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.910\nEverything I do today should be very\nsimilar in a Linux environment, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.010\nWith Windows, it could be a little iffy.\n\n24\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.100\nSo, do keep that in mind, and\nmaybe we'll come back to that.\n\n25\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, PC and Macs are always so\n\n26\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.510\nseparate.\n\n27\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.000\nI mean,\nI have to deal with it all day long,\n\n28\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.510\nwith teaching on both a Mac platform and\na Windows platform.\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.420\nAnd I have remember, wait,\nwhich one does this?\n\n30\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.313\nWait, that's not available in,\npick an operating of your choice.\n\n31\n00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:31.541\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, hopefully,\n\n32\n00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.501\nI can get away with less of\nthe things that you struggle with,\n\n33\n00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.560\nbut there may be some differences,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n34\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.790\nSo, what are we gonna do today?\n\n35\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.910\nWe're just gonna make sure we have\nan idea of where to find the terminal,\n\n36\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.900\nwhat it look likes,\nwhat kind of customization.\n\n37\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.419\nBecause part of being a developer is\ncustomizing your own environment.\n\n38\n00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:53.228\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nstart with today, just so\n\n39\n00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:55.020\nwe're all on the same basis.\n\n40\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.820\nAnd then from here on out, we'll see\nhow to use that terminal environment.\n\n41\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.480\nSo, let's go ahead and\ncome to the screen here.\n\n42\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.620\nAnd I have a blank desktop,\nnothing here, right?\n\n43\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.910\nSo, where can I find the terminal?\n\n44\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.520\nOn a Mac there's a couple of\ndifferent places that I can find it.\n\n45\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.850\nI can come in to the Finder,\nwhich for other environments,\n\n46\n00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.300\nyou'll have something similar.\n\n47\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.560\nAnd I'm gonna come to applications,\nand scroll down.\n\n48\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.460\nAnd, it's kind of odd,\nI don't see anything that says terminal.\n\n49\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.938\nNow, I do have some\nthings installed on mine.\n\n50\n00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:32.453\nThen maybe, this is another\nuser account on my computer.\n\n51\n00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:34.769\nSo you may see some things\nthat you may not have.\n\n52\n00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Is it in the Utilities?\n\n53\n00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.761\nI've been to the terminal\na couple of times.\n\n54\n00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.705\nAnd then I usually go, bye.\n\n55\n00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:48.693\n[LAUGH] But I know I have to\nget there from time to time.\n\n56\n00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:50.580\nIs it in there?\n&gt;&gt; It is in the Utilities.\n\n57\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.980\nAnd if we come in here,\nthese utilities have a variety of things.\n\n58\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.640\nBe very careful, there could be some.\n\n59\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.150\nWhat is disc utility?\n\n60\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.140\nWell, you can wreck your operating system\n\n61\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440\npretty bad if you're\nnot familiar with that.\n\n62\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.530\nBut here is the terminal platform.\n\n63\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.970\nSo if I click terminal,\nthen I should get this open\n\n64\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.666\nup on my screen.\n&gt;&gt; And I hope I didn't give away a secret\n\n65\n00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.180\nor something that you were waiting until,\nI wanted to show you somewhere different.\n\n66\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.185\nBut I just figured I'd throw it in there,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:22.440\nmake myself sound smart\nthat I knew where it was.\n\n68\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.307\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey we gotta take the wins\n\n69\n00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:24.486\nwhere we got them, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n70\n00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.487\n&gt;&gt; So, we have the terminal open, and\n\n71\n00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:28.380\nby by and large, guess what?\n\n72\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.840\nThis is not how I open it.\n\n73\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.970\nSo I'm going to close this, and\nthen we're gonna close out, and\n\n74\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.660\nwe're gonna start back at\nthe plain desktop again.\n\n75\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.211\nNow your terminal may look\na little bit different.\n\n76\n00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:43.136\nBy default on macOS,\nit's black text on a white background.\n\n77\n00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:46.892\nAnd we have this cursor, and\nthen it could be bigger or\n\n78\n00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:52.170\nsmaller on your machine,\ndepending on certain system preferences.\n\n79\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.260\nSo I'm going to go to\nTerminal &gt; Quit Terminal.\n\n80\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.000\nIt's closed, and\n\n81\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.842\nI'm gonna close the Finder\n&gt;&gt; Now what if I'm in a hurry,\n\n82\n00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:02.813\nand I'm trying to get things done, and\n\n83\n00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:05.643\nI don't want to go Applications\n&gt; Utilities, click?\n\n84\n00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:11.648\nWell, my favourite way is if you hold Cmd,\nand hit Space bar.\n\n85\n00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:14.890\nAutomatically you're going to\nopen up a Spotlight search.\n\n86\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.730\nOn Linux, you have a similar search for\nthe most part.\n\n87\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.162\nBut that will typically be the super key.\n\n88\n00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:23.801\nIf you've installed this on\na Windows Operating System based computer,\n\n89\n00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.520\nit'll be the Windows key,\nwhen you are in the Linux environment.\n\n90\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.600\nI'm just going to type terminal.\n\n91\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.010\nAnd, well,\nI'm going to type the first characters.\n\n92\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.980\nAnd I actually use a fair\namount of custom applications.\n\n93\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.200\nSo, I have terminal here.\n\n94\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.740\nAnd then, every once in a while,\nyou'll see depending on,\n\n95\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.480\nif you are on some else's computer\nyou may see things like iTerm.\n\n96\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.450\nIt's a similar environment.\n\n97\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.158\nBut we're going to use the vanilla\nterminal that is provided by macOS,\n\n98\n00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:57.090\nall right?\n\n99\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.490\nSo, that's how I open it.\n\n100\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.590\nI click there.\n\n101\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.420\nI'm going to quit one more time.\n\n102\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.130\nSpotlight, terminal, and\nI'm going to hit Enter.\n\n103\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.710\nI didn't actually have to click anything.\n\n104\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.580\nSo, that's a small difference, but\nover the lifetime of your job, and\n\n105\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.560\nyour working through things,\nthat can be a marked difference in, well,\n\n106\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.160\nhow efficient you are.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the spotlight,\n\n107\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.380\nI use it all the time.\n\n108\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.050\nI will, I don't know if this is\nsomething to mention right here,\n\n109\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.995\nis that you can customize\nto turn that off.\n\n110\n00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:28.702\nCuz I do that for my Adobe product,\n\n111\n00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:33.560\ncuz Cmd+Spacebar is a very\npopular shortcut that I use.\n\n112\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.090\nSo, I've gotten,\nif I'm really using them a lot,\n\n113\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.850\nI'll turn it off in my\nassistant preferences.\n\n114\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.420\nBut, by default, that is the shortcut.\n\n115\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.530\nSo for any crazy reason,\nif you turned it off somewhere, it's in\n\n116\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.850\nthere if you wanted to bring it back up.\n&gt;&gt; And that's a key point to make.\n\n117\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.770\nI never turn mine off,\n\n118\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.960\nbecause I use it all of the time.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.440\n&gt;&gt; But depending on whether\n\n120\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.420\nyou're using someone else's computer\nas you're working along with this,\n\n121\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.060\nyou may find that some of\nthese are a little different.\n\n122\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.731\nAnd you gotta go poking around.\n\n123\n00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:06.450\nBut luckily, that's kinda the nature of,\nwell, becoming a developer.\n\n124\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.050\nSolving problems, right?\n\n125\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.840\nSo I have my terminal open.\n\n126\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.060\nAnd by default, I have a white background,\nblack text, and then I have Terminal.\n\n127\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.190\nAnd there's not a lot here.\n\n128\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.820\nI can Hide, Hide Others, I can Quit.\n\n129\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.530\nServices, that's actually a a pretty\ncommon menu item in macOS.\n\n130\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.020\nAnd even to some extent, you'll see\nthis in Linux from time to time.\n\n131\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.914\nWe don't care about this,\nsecure keyboard entry.\n\n132\n00:06:31.914 --> 00:06:33.220\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n133\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.770\nWe are going to come back to\npreferences shortly, though.\n\n134\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.575\nIf I come to shell, what is Shell?\n\n135\n00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:41.380\nWell, that's actually what's\nrunning inside of that.\n\n136\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.960\nSo this is a terminal emulation program.\n\n137\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.920\nAnd then I have that shell running.\n\n138\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.360\nI can create a new terminal window, and\nI can create a whole bunch of these.\n\n139\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.790\nI typically don't mess with this.\n\n140\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.180\nI just create a new one after I\ndo the customization that I want.\n\n141\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.040\nAnd we're gonna see that shortly.\n\n142\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.230\nI can actually have tabs\nwithin my terminal.\n\n143\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.090\nSo it'll look like your\nGoogle Chrome browser.\n\n144\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.280\nAnd you can have a bunch of different\nterminal environments running\n\n145\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.050\nin a single window, and have them tabbed,\nwhich could come in handy.\n\n146\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.170\nWe're not going to mess with that\nright now, but it is available.\n\n147\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.346\nAnd then these remote connections,\n\n148\n00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:18.077\nmaybe that's a little beyond\nthe scope of what we need for now.\n\n149\n00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:22.090\nAs is some of these other ones,\nother than, maybe, Close Window.\n\n150\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.390\nI come to Edit, I do have a Copy and\nPaste, and I don't have anything to paste.\n\n151\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.720\nBut I can copy portions from the terminal.\n\n152\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.310\nYou can do that with a point and\nclick as well.\n\n153\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.580\nAnd then we have a Select All,\nand there's Bookmarks.\n\n154\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.350\nI will tell you, I have never used\na bookmark at all in Terminal.\n\n155\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.800\nSo, that might be one of those edge\ncases where it could help you.\n\n156\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.308\nBut it doesn't help me, because I tend to\nbe a little more old school, so to speak.\n\n157\n00:07:50.308 --> 00:07:54.088\nAnd then if we come down here,\nwe can Num Lock, you can set on things.\n\n158\n00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:55.488\nLet me zoom out just a little bit.\n\n159\n00:07:55.488 --> 00:08:00.297\nEmojis and symbols, which is just [SOUND]\nYou may not have that on all things.\n\n160\n00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:03.973\nI would stay away from some of these\nmore advanced options, at least for now,\n\n161\n00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:07.240\nbecause this is just getting started,\nright.\n\n162\n00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.030\nAnd then in our View we\ncan Show the Tab Bar.\n\n163\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.100\nOr, well if I Show the Tab Bar notice,\nokay, there's this little plus sign here.\n\n164\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.600\nIf I go to View I can Hide the Tab Bar.\n\n165\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.120\nAnd if I have tabs open from the previous\none, then I'm probably gonna see that\n\n166\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.870\nanyway when there's multiple\ntabs just as a reminder.\n\n167\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.170\nThere's no guarantee because you\nmay hide it from the View menu.\n\n168\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.045\nAnd then Split Pane,\nwell what does that do?\n\n169\n00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:38.106\nWell it splits the pane between\nthis top one and this bottom one.\n\n170\n00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:44.720\nWell hmm, Close Split Pane because\nwe wanna keep it simple for now.\n\n171\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.790\nAnd then Scroll to the Top,\nScroll to the Bottom.\n\n172\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.840\nThese are quick commands, but notice\nall of these have keyboard shortcuts.\n\n173\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.333\nYou will find yourself using a fair\namount of keyboard shortcuts, and\n\n174\n00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.954\nwe'll highlight those,\nor I'll highlight those.\n\n175\n00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:02.530\nOthers may highlight them as well as\nwe come to them because some are more\n\n176\n00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.376\nuseful than others, and\nyou start to learn these as you need them.\n\n177\n00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:09.680\nAnd then Full Screen,\nwell what is Full Screen?\n\n178\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.045\nIt's just really big terminal and\nI'm gonna zoom all the way out, and\n\n179\n00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:15.870\nthat means that's the only\nthing I'm focusing on.\n\n180\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.130\nAnd if this is your first time here,\ncould be a very scary experience.\n\n181\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:26.280\nI'm gonna hit Escape, and Escape doesn't\nwork like it does on some other ones.\n\n182\n00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.270\nAnd then here,\nsee this little green button?\n\n183\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.160\nThis is Mac specific.\n\n184\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.410\nI can now shrink that down.\n\n185\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.670\nOn Linux and Windows a lot of times\nthat will just fill the space.\n\n186\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.150\nThat is a very Mac specific behavior.\n\n187\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.040\nSo if you're used to going, Escape\nwill get me out of full screen stuff,\n\n188\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.560\nyou may get some weirdness here.\n&gt;&gt; This is only a personal\n\n189\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.490\nquestion for myself.\n\n190\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.310\nIf you go in the View menu, does it have\nthe same shortcut for Enter Full Screen?\n\n191\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.793\nYeah, okay so that Cmd+Shift+F,\nthat is a Mac specific\n\n192\n00:09:57.793 --> 00:10:02.470\nkeyboard shortcut to take you in and\nout of full screen mode?\n\n193\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.451\nI didn't know if it would actually do it\ninternal, but it's part of the Mac OS, so\n\n194\n00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:09.290\nyeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n195\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.580\nwhat she's saying is that on this screen,\nif I hold Cmd+Shift.\n\n196\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.620\nCommand is right next to your keyboard,\nand I hit F.\n\n197\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.600\nThere's nothing there, right.\n\n198\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.370\nSo wait a minute, not Shift.\n\n199\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:21.965\nIs that Shift?\n\n200\n00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.780\nView-\n&gt;&gt; No, it's Control, I'm sorry,\n\n201\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.390\nsorry.\n&gt;&gt; Control, sorry.\n\n202\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.460\nCmd+Cntrl+F and\n\n203\n00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.100\nI can actually toggle that through\na keyboard shortcut instead of clicking.\n\n204\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.880\nSo that is handy to know.\n\n205\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.800\nIt's not Escape though cuz we're always\ntaught to Escape, Escape, Escape.\n\n206\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.370\nWell if you're in full\nscreen in the terminal and\n\n207\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.130\nyou're kinda freaking out,\nEscape's not gonna help you.\n\n208\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.720\nJust hover to the top, and\n\n209\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.310\nusually your toolbar's gonna come back.\n&gt;&gt; And those shortcuts, I always have to\n\n210\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.350\nremind myself about what those little\nicons mean for what their mapped to.\n\n211\n00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.180\nAnd yeah, it's not the Shift key,\nit's the Control key,\n\n212\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.400\nthe little carrot looking\nthing is Control.\n\n213\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.543\nCarrot control.\n\n214\n00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:02.783\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I do love carrots, so\n\n215\n00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:04.950\nkeep those in mind.\n\n216\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.300\nWe will probably not use a whole lot\nof keyboard shortcuts initially.\n\n217\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.860\nAnd Vonne, I'm gonna ask you to keep\nme honest, if you see me using keyboard\n\n218\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.850\nshortcuts all over the place because\nI use them in my daily work flow.\n\n219\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.040\nI'm gonna need you to call me out on them,\nand\n\n220\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.240\nthat way we're very explicit\nabout what we're doing.\n\n221\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.990\nAnd then finally the Windows.\n\n222\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.650\nIf I have multiple ones open, I can well\nalso manipulate the currently selected\n\n223\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.350\none, I can cycle through\nthe ones that are open, and\n\n224\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.190\nthen I've never used a window group.\n\n225\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.030\nSo that's something that's a little more\nof an Edge case feature where I can say I\n\n226\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.620\nwant these windows opened and\nclosed as a group.\n\n227\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.050\nAnd it gets a little wonky to me.\n\n228\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.342\nI spend a lot more time\nsetting up the group and\n\n229\n00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.372\nmanaging the group then I do\nactually doing anything else.\n\n230\n00:11:51.372 --> 00:11:55.000\nAnd then I will have\nadditional list of windows.\n\n231\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.060\nSo if I come here and New Window,\nNew Window from Settings.\n\n232\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.810\nI now have two windows and\nI have a list of two.\n\n233\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.970\nNotice they're both named exactly the\nsame, so you're like, which one's what?\n\n234\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.380\nWell we'll see that in due time.\n\n235\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.500\nI'm gonna close out of this.\n\n236\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.860\nAnd finally, we're gonna get back\nover into the terminal window.\n\n237\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.710\nAnd if you're on a different\noperating system, specifically Linux,\n\n238\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:27.650\nbecause a lot of this is similar,\nit may not be in this first menu item.\n\n239\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.470\nIt may either be under File or\n\n240\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.255\nEdit depending on your flavor.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n241\n00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:35.295\nit seems that Windows is more\nin the Edit and then Mac.\n\n242\n00:12:35.295 --> 00:12:38.735\nI don't use Linux, I've never used Linux,\nI have no idea what that it.\n\n243\n00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:41.275\nBut it is usually in like\nwhatever the application is,\n\n244\n00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:42.965\nthat's where your preferences are.\n\n245\n00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:47.860\nAnd then sometimes it's like the Edit is,\nsometimes Options, but a lot of\n\n246\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.920\ntimes they use Preferences as well.\n&gt;&gt; And usually it's listed as Preferences,\n\n247\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.630\nso just go kinda diving around your menus\nuntil you find those respective pieces.\n\n248\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:02.610\nSo if I go to Preferences, I'm gonna get\nthis kinda open selection pane, right.\n\n249\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.930\nSo I have General, right, and\nI'm gonna zoom out just a little bit.\n\n250\n00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.380\nA new window on startup,\nopen a new window with profile Basic.\n\n251\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.650\nA profile are the settings that\nyou customize through this.\n\n252\n00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.140\nI can create one that's just for\n\n253\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.820\nme on this same user account, Vonne can\ncreate something that's just for her.\n\n254\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.170\nBut by default it's going\nto open with basic.\n\n255\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.150\nAnd we're gonna see these\nprofiles in just a moment.\n\n256\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.330\nShells open with default login shell.\n\n257\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:39.690\nWith Mac that is Bash by default until\nyou go and start tweaking that around.\n\n258\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.950\nSo that's good,\nnew windows open with default profile.\n\n259\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.680\nAnd again, that has to do with either\nVonne or I have created a profile.\n\n260\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.470\nAnd new tabs open with\nthe currently open profile.\n\n261\n00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.370\nSo these are the basic settings,\n\n262\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.250\nI tend not to mess with these unless\nI have a very particular reason to.\n\n263\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:02.560\nAnd then if I come back over here and\nI go to Profiles,\n\n264\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.096\nI have all these pre-made\nprofiles that I can select from.\n\n265\n00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.180\nLike grass, I have never used Grass,\n\n266\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.340\nI do not find green appealing\non my background color.\n\n267\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.909\nBut I wanted to click and\nshow you that a lot of these are changing,\n\n268\n00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:19.997\nright, the background color and effects.\n\n269\n00:14:19.997 --> 00:14:23.440\nWell I get green when I'm on Grass.\n\n270\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.170\nIf I go to Homebrew, I get black.\n\n271\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.660\nI can set a background image.\n\n272\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.382\nI'm not going to, may be you want to.\n\n273\n00:14:30.382 --> 00:14:33.950\nBe very careful,\nsometimes it's really hard to read text,\n\n274\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.790\nyou may miss small characters\nlike periods or apostrophes or\n\n275\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.480\nthings like that if you have\nreally a really busy image.\n\n276\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.768\nBut you can set an image.\n\n277\n00:14:40.768 --> 00:14:48.649\nThe font, [SOUND] the font is something\nthat is also a personal flavor.\n\n278\n00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:52.710\nThis is in Courier, or Courier, Courier.\n&gt;&gt; Courier.\n\n279\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.340\n&gt;&gt; I always mispronounce that.\n\n280\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.023\n&gt;&gt; I say Courier.\n\n281\n00:14:54.023 --> 00:14:55.352\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But here,\n\n282\n00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.880\nit's SF Mono Regular 11 point.\n\n283\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.570\nIt's a monospace font, which is handy,\nand I recommend picking a monospace font.\n\n284\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.610\nWhat does monospace mean?\n\n285\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.630\nAnd Vonne,\nyou may correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n286\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.280\nthat means every character takes up\nthe same amount of space when you type it.\n\n287\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.780\nSo a W is not twice as big as an A.\n\n288\n00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.350\nI'm using twice in a loose manner,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n289\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.710\nIt helps kind of arrange everything\non the screen more uniformly.\n\n290\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.030\nSo I would definitely\npick a monospace font.\n\n291\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you have monospace fonts, and\n\n292\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.650\nyou have proportional width fonts, and\n\n293\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.350\nthat's where your I takes up\nless room than your W or your M.\n\n294\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.800\nAnd if you think about it,\nyour M is your widest character, so\n\n295\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.830\nthat becomes the fixed width for\nevery character,\n\n296\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.750\nand they occupy the same,\nit's almost like a block.\n\n297\n00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.291\nDon't get me started talking about fonts.\n\n298\n00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:45.003\nI could talk for days about it.\n\n299\n00:15:45.003 --> 00:15:47.546\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We gonna leave that to be.\n\n300\n00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:50.053\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we have some text settings.\n\n301\n00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:55.027\nBut you should definitely check that out\nbecause it seems like a simple preference.\n\n302\n00:15:55.027 --> 00:15:59.031\nBut it can be, it can make or break kind\nof your experience, especially if you're\n\n303\n00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:03.320\ntrying to line up things appropriately.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I can see in coding when\n\n304\n00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.180\nit's very important with that, I mean,\nfor readability and everything.\n\n305\n00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:13.420\nI'm talking like if I'm making a flyer,\nI probably would pick a monospace font for\n\n306\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:19.250\na specific look and feel,\nlike kind of computery typewriter-ish.\n\n307\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.870\nBut in code land,\nyou wanna keep that space so\n\n308\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.630\nyou can see everything pretty well.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I will pick one and\n\n309\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.740\nwe'll see.\n\n310\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.860\nI may disobey my own\nsuggestions from time to time.\n\n311\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.240\nAnd then we can pick some colors,\n\n312\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.720\nlike our color palette,\nas well as the style of cursor.\n\n313\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.880\nI tend to leave these fairly uniform but\nI am going to change something.\n\n314\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.150\nThis pro, I'm going to click this pro,\nand that's a ten point font.\n\n315\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.160\nI'm going to change that font and\nyou get this little pop up and\n\n316\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.520\nwhat am I going to use?\n\n317\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.790\nLet's see here.\n\n318\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.960\nLet's keep it at Monaco just because I\ndon't want to spend too much time there.\n\n319\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.700\nBut for our purposes,\nI'm probably gonna jump this up to 18 and\n\n320\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.380\nI may even comeback and jump it up to 20.\n\n321\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.370\nSo I have a really large font on\nthe screen, so you can see, so\n\n322\n00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.120\nI can see and I'm not straining\nmy eyes while I'm sitting there.\n\n323\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.040\nOnce I make that selection, I'm gonna\nexit out and that should be saved there.\n\n324\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:24.150\nThe easiest way to get this to work\nis to set that as the default.\n\n325\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:28.942\nAnd that way, that pro selection, and\nI did that because it's background.\n\n326\n00:17:28.942 --> 00:17:30.034\nIt has white text.\n\n327\n00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:31.515\nIt's a very simple one.\n\n328\n00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:35.670\nI've made that selection as default,\nso now any new windows that I open for\n\n329\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.860\nthis profile, we're not gonna create\ncustom profiles because that's very\n\n330\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.740\nsystem specific, I'm talking just Mac OS.\n\n331\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.900\nAll of the things that I've\nchanged are also available on\n\n332\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.868\nthe other systems like Linux and\nWindows, to some extent.\n\n333\n00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:51.600\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna change the font size and\n\n334\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.550\nI'm gonna make sure that I have a black\nbackground color with white font.\n\n335\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.320\nAnd by doing that,\nI have also a white cursor.\n\n336\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.270\nNow, let's just quickly go through\nsome of these other windows.\n\n337\n00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.880\nTitle, you can change the custom title.\n\n338\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:12.770\nYou can also change some of the selections\nhere, like, working directory or document.\n\n339\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.600\nWhat does that do?\n\n340\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.680\nWell you turn it off and It allows you\nto see kind of on the left-hand side,\n\n341\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.710\nand you'll see in subsequent\nepisodes what that ultimately does.\n\n342\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.440\nSo you have some advanced options here.\n\n343\n00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.160\nNot really gonna dive into these because\nthey're not applicable to us, but\n\n344\n00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.430\nI do want to let you\nknow that they're there.\n\n345\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.100\nAnd then for tabs, you have\nsimilar settings for tabs as well.\n\n346\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:41.285\nShell, this is where you can set a\ndifferent shell like this general profile.\n\n347\n00:18:41.285 --> 00:18:43.220\nBut for particular profiles,\n\n348\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.750\nyou can set different shells\nto run differently, right.\n\n349\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.070\nSo we could do Bash or\nwe could do Seashell or\n\n350\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.635\nCornshell or any of those shells,\nif you have different ones, yeah.\n\n351\n00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.570\nVonne's looking at me like, what?\n\n352\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.010\nWhat are you talking about?\n&gt;&gt; There's korn shell?\n\n353\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's a korn shell with a K.\n\n354\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.825\nIt's odd, so.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n355\n00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:05.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could set those up customly, but\n\n356\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.820\nI think that's a little beyond\nthe scope of what we're doing here.\n\n357\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.300\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know if you were making a joke\n\n358\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.110\nor like, no that's a real shell\n&gt;&gt; A korn shell.\n\n359\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.575\n&gt;&gt; That's a real shell.\n\n360\n00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:17.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I try to not make things like\n\n361\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.600\nthat up.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.630\n&gt;&gt; You know me better than that.\n\n363\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.272\nI make stuff up all the time.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n364\n00:19:21.272 --> 00:19:23.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we have these shells and\n\n365\n00:19:23.045 --> 00:19:25.290\nwe're just gonna stay with\nthe standard Bash shell.\n\n366\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.730\nBut if you ever start digging in later on,\nthat's where these are.\n\n367\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.140\nAnd then keyboard, wow, that's a lot.\n\n368\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.630\nWhat do these do?\n\n369\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:40.910\nWhat characters are output when you\ntype particular keyboard commands?\n\n370\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:47.438\nThese are slash 033 but\nthese are, wait for it,\n\n371\n00:19:47.438 --> 00:19:54.930\nthese unicode characters that have\nspecific like color, like embeddings or\n\n372\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.470\nare special characters like the copyright\nsign, or things of that nature.\n\n373\n00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.450\nSo we don't really need those as well.\n\n374\n00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.340\nAnd then here advanced,\nyou know what advanced means?\n\n375\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.180\nWe'll come back to it later.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Now I realize that I've said,\n\n377\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.120\nwe'll come back to this later\non several of these things.\n\n378\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.250\nI'm just gonna give you an overview\nof the settings that you can make\n\n379\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.650\nwhile changing the settings\nthat we're gonna use for\n\n380\n00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.480\nthe remainder of this course.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't realize that Terminal would\n\n381\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.630\nhave that many customizations.\n\n382\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.540\nBut, I mean, I guess if you're gonna\nbe typing a lot of command lines and\n\n383\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.230\nall that kind of stuff,\nI mean, I do this too.\n\n384\n00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.630\nI want my window to be bigger.\n\n385\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.900\nI want my line space to be different.\n\n386\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.350\nAt least you know it's in here and\nthat the more you use it,\n\n387\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.900\nthe more things start to kind of like,\nman, can I just tweak that?\n\n388\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.180\nI bet you it might be in the advanced,\nbut I bet you I could tweak it.\n\n389\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for the most part you can.\n\n390\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.500\nJust be very careful, you can end up\nsinking a whole bunch of time to get it,\n\n391\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.030\nthis is my environment now.\n\n392\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.390\nWhen we're starting out,\nlet's not worry about it,\n\n393\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.420\nlet's make sure we can read the text.\n\n394\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.320\nI find it easier to read black, or\nexcuse me, black background and\n\n395\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.560\nwhite text just because\nof contrast issues.\n\n396\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.920\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n397\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.960\nAnd there are a couple of other things\nthat we can do, a Window group.\n\n398\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.960\nThat's again, a grouping of Windows\nthat I can open or close together.\n\n399\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.280\nI've never used this,\nI haven't found a need to.\n\n400\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.460\nAnd that's based on how\nI work in the terminal.\n\n401\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.920\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n402\n00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.180\nThen I'm gonna come to encodings, and\n\n403\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.240\nhere are all the text encodings that would\nbe supported currently in the terminal.\n\n404\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.925\nYour mileage may vary\ndepending on other systems.\n\n405\n00:21:25.925 --> 00:21:30.390\nBut right now, we have UTF 8,\n\n406\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.580\nwhat Vonne could probably\ntalk more specifically about.\n\n407\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.830\nI only look to see if I support UTF 8 and\nASCII.\n\n408\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.538\nAnd that's all I care about in general.\n\n409\n00:21:39.538 --> 00:21:41.840\nNow if you're in a different country,\n\n410\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.880\nyou may care about supporting other\ncharacter sets and things of that nature.\n\n411\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.510\nSo you need to kinda poke around.\n\n412\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.500\nThese allow you to poke around in\nthe various encodings that are supported\n\n413\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.910\nfor your terminal environment, which\nones are by default available to you.\n\n414\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.060\nSo now that we have that,\nlet's scroll on out of here and exit out.\n\n415\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.620\nIf I go back to Profiles, notice this\nis set to Default, just as a reminder.\n\n416\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.433\nAnd l did change the text to\na little bit larger font.\n\n417\n00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:14.236\nAnd if you exit out,\nthis is really off putting, you go, well.\n\n418\n00:22:14.236 --> 00:22:15.443\n&gt;&gt; Why did it change?\n\n419\n00:22:15.443 --> 00:22:20.381\nWell, you changed the settings, it\nshould change the thing you have opened.\n\n420\n00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.956\n&gt;&gt; it should, but notice,\n\n421\n00:22:21.956 --> 00:22:27.450\nin that previous menu, right, it says all\nnew windows when you open new windows.\n\n422\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.570\nSo this is our first keyboard short cut\n\n423\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.580\nthat will be helpful when you're\ntrying to do a bunch of things.\n\n424\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.150\nI hold command and hit end,\nI now have a new terminal window open.\n\n425\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.100\nThis is a new instance.\n\n426\n00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.415\nThese are not kind of tied,\nother than they're on the same computer.\n\n427\n00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:48.980\nIt doesn't mean if I type something\nover here that that happens over there.\n\n428\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.120\nOkay, notice that this font is bigger.\n\n429\n00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.170\nSo this is now applied whenever I\n\n430\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.010\nopen a particular terminal window.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just making sure my\n\n431\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.420\neyes aren't playing tricks on me, but\n\n432\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.980\nthere's like a transparency on\nthat background, isn't there?\n\n433\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:08.260\nI can see the white square behind it,\nthat's on purpose?\n\n434\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is on purpose.\n\n435\n00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.460\nSo the pro-theme by default has\na semi-transparent background.\n\n436\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.720\nYou can go and tweak that, but\nthat does bring up a good point,\n\n437\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.300\nthat we're currently not\nin full screen mode, right.\n\n438\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.270\nSo there's, it's handy because now\nI'm like, there's that application.\n\n439\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.500\nSo the terminal doesn't black out things.\n\n440\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.760\nIf I come back up here and\n\n441\n00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.810\nI open this full screen,\nit is no longer semi transparent.\n\n442\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:38.190\nIt is fully opaque, or it's still semi\ntransparent and there's just black behind\n\n443\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.280\nit, tomato tomato type thing.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's kinda slick actually,\n\n444\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.990\nI like that, I mean just a personal.\n&gt;&gt; You're like, look at that,\n\n445\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.070\nI got stuff behind there.\n\n446\n00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.150\nYou will never lose Windows\nagain in terminal land.\n\n447\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.970\nBut that is our initial set up,\nthat's how I get to it.\n\n448\n00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.998\nJust as a reminder,\nI use Command, Space Bar, and\n\n449\n00:23:58.998 --> 00:24:02.810\nlike I said that was our first keyboard\nshortcut just a moment ago, I lied.\n\n450\n00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.790\nCommand space bar gets us open\nin the spot light, terminal.\n\n451\n00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.170\nBoom, we're open.\n\n452\n00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:11.990\nAnd just to show you, if I quit\nthe terminal and I type terminal,\n\n453\n00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.800\nwhoa and I yell terminal,\nif I type terminal now, and I open,\n\n454\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.350\nnotice that profile is set by default,\nso we'll always see that.\n\n455\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.820\nDefinitely poke around, test this out.\n\n456\n00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.190\nFigure out what best fits you.\n\n457\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.345\nDo keep in mind, having images or\n\n458\n00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:31.398\nmulti-colors or\nreally bright colors long term.\n\n459\n00:24:31.398 --> 00:24:34.280\nitt may seem novel,\nit may not be the best.\n\n460\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.170\nAlso we have Command End that\nwill open up new windows which\n\n461\n00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.900\nare probably handy in the Mac environment.\n\n462\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.880\nI do know that any time I say Command,\n\n463\n00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.830\non Linux environments,\nthat's typically replaced by Control.\n\n464\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:55.840\nSo it's Command End for\nMac OS, Control End for\n\n465\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.860\nLinux, and then, well, those of you\nwho are using Windows out there,\n\n466\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.160\nwe'll probably have to\ncircle back around and come.\n\n467\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.250\nLet's take an exploration of your\nparticular operating system.\n\n468\n00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.400\nBut we now have open terminal,\nwe know how to get there.\n\n469\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.420\nWe've customized a little bit so\nwe can see it and\n\n470\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.310\nnow we can start using it seeing what\nare the basic things that we need to\n\n471\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.930\nunderstand as we continue our progress\ntoward to becoming a developer.\n\n472\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.830\nNice.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n473\n00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.590\nJustin lots of great information there.\n\n474\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.300\nGood to know we have so\nmany options for our preferences and\n\n475\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.090\nwe can make things pink and green.\n\n476\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.060\nBut like you said, you probably wanna\njust stick with what they got and\n\n477\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.400\nthen tweak as you need,as you move through\nusing the terminal a little bit more.\n\n478\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.090\nBut I know we have a lot more\ngreat episodes in this show.\n\n479\n00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.230\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n480\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.150\nSigning off for Dev ProTV.\n\n481\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.690\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jess Nelson.\n\n482\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.468\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n",

I'm doing fantastic, Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:30.815\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:32.055\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing all right.\n\n13\n00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.695\nI'm excited to hear about how we're\ngonnagoing to be navigating the Terminal.\n\n14\n00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.190\nWe did our preferences and everything.\n\n15\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.040\nLearn about how we can do all that and\n\n16\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.030\nnow, I figure we're gonna\nlearn how to get around?\n\n17\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.150\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that we have to learn\nhow to do is how to move around, right?\n\n18\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.860\nIf you just open the terminal and\nthen you just kinda hang out,\n\n19\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.210\nthat's probably not a good experience,\nespecially I don't typically\n\n20\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.400\nkeep my files in a single\nfolder on my computer, right?\n\n21\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.222\nI have folders and sub folders and\nthey're all over the place right?\n\n22\n00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:07.120\nMaybe a Dropbox running or maybe you have\nsomething else that's always syncing.\n\n23\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.750\nSo there's a lot of complexity there and\nbeing able to navigate around so\n\n24\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.690\nyou can go, that's where I need to go,\nthat's the file I need.\n\n25\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.030\nThat's important, so that's what\nwe're gonna do in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, just in environment, we\ncan go ahead and like click on the finder,\n\n27\n00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.350\nI'm talking Mac specific,\nbecause that's the operating system that\n\n28\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.840\nI'm associating myself with right now,\ncuz I use both.\n\n29\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.010\nBut, we go into open a file and then\nopen a folder and then we have different\n\n30\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.240\nfolders within folders, and\nit's just our regular file directory.\n\n31\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.210\nSo, in the terminal, in that,\n\n32\n00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.610\nI'm still gonna call it a command line,\nthat's how we're getting around that way?\n\n33\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd it's perfectly fine to call it\n\n34\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.560\nthe command line interface,\nbecause when I think of it,\n\n35\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.250\nit is a command line\ninterface to your computer.\n\n36\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.820\nRight?\nNow, there are some nuances,\n\n37\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.340\nthere are some, probably, minute.\n\n38\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.000\nAnd we're just trying to keep this simple.\n\n39\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.210\nIt's not about driving home\nthe technicalities of things.\n\n40\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.420\nIt's about being proficient.\n\n41\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.910\nLet's actually start navigating around.\n\n42\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.860\nThere's actually not a whole lot to\nremember, but there is a little bit of\n\n43\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.250\njargon, so do keep that in mind,\nsome of these abbreviations and things.\n\n44\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.310\nI would take note of those\nas we go through those.\n\n45\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.860\nLet's come down into the screen.\n\n46\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.360\nWell, I just have an empty screen here and\nI'm gonna hold command and\n\n47\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.720\nhit space bar, little different\ndepending on what system you're on.\n\n48\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570\nAnd I'm just gonna look for terminal.\n\n49\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.310\nNow, I could have easily\nwent into the finder or\n\n50\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.870\nyour respective operating system and\nfound it.\n\n51\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.852\nWindows users, again, you're probably\ngonna hear me say this a lot,\n\n52\n00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:38.860\nit's gonna take a little\nmore poking around.\n\n53\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.050\nBut once you get used to it, it's gonna\nbe very similar to what we're doing here.\n\n54\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.230\nAll right?\nSo here is here's devpro and\n\n55\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.900\nthat's because that's my user\nname up here in the top.\n\n56\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.270\nThat is currently the account\nthat I'm logged onto.\n\n57\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.830\nSo, you're probably gonna see your user\nname that you log onto your computer with.\n\n58\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.720\nAnd that's ultimately what that means.\n\n59\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.650\nThis is the name of my computer.\n\n60\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.020\nYour prompt may look a little bit\ndifferent based on preferences or\n\n61\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.120\nthe system that you're on.\n\n62\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.320\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, so\nthe first part, before the login,\n\n63\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.250\nis gonna be your computer name and\nI name my personal computers all sorts\n\n64\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.490\nof fluffy words like bunnies and\nbuffy bunny and\n\n65\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.925\nyeah that's my nickname, and then yep\nthat's what my computer is named too.\n\n66\n00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:24.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n67\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.130\nas long as you know those particulars,\nthen you're all good,\n\n68\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.500\nnow there is something that I want to\ndrive home about kind of default settings.\n\n69\n00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.140\nSee this tilde,\nthat means you are for the most part,\n\n70\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.450\nthere are ways to change this, you're in\nthe home directory where everybody starts\n\n71\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.780\nfor this particular user, right?\n\n72\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.120\nThe user that you're logged in.\n\n73\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.300\nThis is called your home,\nso tilde is home.\n\n74\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.570\nBut if you had no idea where\non your computer you are and\n\n75\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.048\nI've zoomed in a little bit just so\nwe can see, then our first command is pwd.\n\n76\n00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:04.400\nThis is imperative.\n\n77\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.660\nThis is kinda ubiquitous, not imperative,\nubiquitous to fair amount of shells.\n\n78\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.950\nWe're using bash because that's default\nfor Mac and that's usually the default for\n\n79\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.620\nLinux flavors, unless you've change it.\n\n80\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.357\nBut pwd just like that,\n\n81\n00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:24.780\npwd present working directory\nis what I think of it is.\n\n82\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.080\nIf I'm not mistaken,\nit means print the working directory.\n\n83\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.420\nWorking directory is the current\ndirectory or folder that you're in.\n\n84\n00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.940\nAnd it will give you,\nwhere are you in your computer.\n\n85\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.880\nWell you're in the user's folder and\nyou're in the devpro folder, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.540\nSo that's how I know where I am.\n\n87\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560\nSo pwd is our first,\nyou gotta get your bearings, right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.940\nLike, where am I?\n\n89\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.470\nWhat's going on?\n\n90\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.400\nPwd will allow you to figure that out.\n\n91\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.610\n&gt;&gt; Is it too early to ask\nabout that dollar sign?\n\n92\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.870\nIs that just a regular occurrence for\nusername?\n\n93\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.690\n&gt;&gt; The dollar sign,\nthat's a great question, is a dollar sign.\n\n94\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.000\nAnd this is where I'm so entrenched in it,\nI don't even think about it.\n\n95\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.310\nUsually this character,\nthere's some character,\n\n96\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.860\na lot of times a dollar sign,\nthat ends this first part.\n\n97\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.480\nSo it's saying hey,\nyou're on Justin's Macbook Pro.\n\n98\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.110\nIn the home directory for\n\n99\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.680\ndevpro the user, dollar sign, that means,\nthis is where you type stuff.\n\n100\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.370\nThis is the finish of the prompt,\nend of line for that prompt and\n\n101\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.270\nthen you type things there.\n\n102\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.260\nSo here, if I just type things.\n\n103\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.760\nActually, if I just hit enter notice\nthat shows me where my character is.\n\n104\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.400\nSo just in case my cursor is hard to find,\n\n105\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.150\nI just come to the end of that line\ncuz these can get fairly long.\n\n106\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's just the separator\nbetween wherever you are and\n\n107\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.730\nthe commands that you're gonna\nbe typing in after that.\n\n108\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.600\nI would assume it's almost like\nthe colon to be there, but\n\n109\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.760\nsince the colon's already been using\nit in this particular syntax of\n\n110\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.440\nthe name of the computer,\nthey can't really put another colon there.\n\n111\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.160\n&gt;&gt; And that's absolutely correct.\n\n112\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.820\nThat's just this syntax,\nthat's a common convention.\n\n113\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.860\n&gt;&gt; But it is not the only one.\n\n114\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.420\nI actually use a whole lot\nof customizations to where\n\n115\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.330\nmine doesn't have that.\n\n116\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.070\nBut we're gonna stay kinda vanilla,\nso to speak.\n\n117\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.870\nSo if you see a dollar sign, this is, hey,\nat the command prompt, at your terminal\n\n118\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.540\nprompt, you open terminal and\nyou have a blinking cursor at this point.\n\n119\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.520\nIf you ever see this in reading or in\nbooks or in things that I kinda give out,\n\n120\n00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.410\neven if it's just a dollar\nsign with nothing before it,\n\n121\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.320\nthat means at the command prompt,\nstart typing.\n\n122\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.280\nDon't type the dollar sign again.\n\n123\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.000\nDon't go, dollar sign, pwd,\ncuz that's different than\n\n124\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.660\nbeing at the $ and typing pwd,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n125\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.290\nSo we've kind of gathered\nour bearings right.\n\n126\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.630\nWe are what present directory are we in?\n\n127\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.480\nWell we are in the users devpro like that.\n\n128\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.180\nWell, okay, I know what folder I am in.\n\n129\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.140\nWhen I say directory and\nfolder that means exactly the same thing.\n\n130\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.390\nWhat folder am I in?\n\n131\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.020\nOkay well I'm in the devpro folder and\nthat's usually named after the user name.\n\n132\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.950\nSo your home directory is the same\nname as the user your logged in.\n\n133\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.690\nAnd so okay well,\nhow do I know where I can go?\n\n134\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.560\nWell I could start moving around.\n\n135\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.050\nBut where am I?\n\n136\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.680\nAnd then the next question is,\nwhat's around me, right?\n\n137\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.040\nIf you ever find yourself in a normal\nsituation, you'll start looking around.\n\n138\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.030\nThe easiest way to look around,\non the command-line,\n\n139\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.070\nis ls which is short for list.\n\n140\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.290\nThat's how I think of it.\n\n141\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.887\nThere maybe a more technically\nappropriate name but\n\n142\n00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:49.796\nls gives me a list of folders and\nfiles or directories and\n\n143\n00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.882\nfiles that are contained\nwithin this folder.\n\n144\n00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:57.596\nSo inside of Users/devpro\nthere's a Desktop folder,\n\n145\n00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:02.180\na Documents folder, a Downloads folder,\na Library folder Movies,\n\n146\n00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.710\nMusic, Pictures, Public, and\nnotice they're just listed out.\n\n147\n00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.050\nNow depending on your terminal, they may\nbe arranged a little bit differently, or\n\n148\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.140\nmaybe even different colors.\n\n149\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.310\nBut that will give you the list of not\nonly folders, which is all I have here,\n\n150\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.310\nbut also files that are contained\nwithin this folder.\n\n151\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just like the same things you\nsee in your Finder or Windows Explorer,\n\n152\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.280\nwhatever the Linux thing is.\n\n153\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.010\nSo you see all that stuff and\n\n154\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.940\nthey're just the default things that\njust come with the operating system.\n\n155\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n156\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:37.560\nAnd just to show you that I'm actually\ngonna open Finder, and I'm going to go to,\n\n157\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.020\nI always have fun times getting\nto my respective documents,\n\n158\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.560\nso /Users/slash.\n\n159\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.940\nLet's go here.\n\n160\n00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.470\nMacintosh HD.\n\n161\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.010\nI don't know why they just don't\nlet me go there real easy like.\n\n162\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it, yeah.\n\n163\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.610\nI use the Go menu a lot of times.\n\n164\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Go.\n\n165\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.050\n&gt;&gt; And then Computer, is that the-\n&gt;&gt; I think it is.\n\n166\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.032\nMacintosh HD, Users, devpro.\n\n167\n00:09:04.032 --> 00:09:04.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Notice it gave me a little home.\n\n169\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.430\nBut now here are those folders.\n\n170\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.020\nBut I wanted to open that,\nbecause let's create a new folder.\n\n171\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.780\nI'm actually clicking.\n\n172\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.110\nI'm just gonna leave it untilted because\nwe're gonna, we'll get rid of that.\n\n173\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.180\nBut if I come back over and\n\n174\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.460\nI type ls, notice there's another listing\nthere called Untitled Folder, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.630\nSo that's important to know that it\nis just a list of folders and files.\n\n176\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.790\nWe don't have any files in here.\n\n177\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.430\nThere's a list of folders and\nfiles that you'll have within a directory.\n\n178\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.650\n&gt;&gt; That's at the home level.\n\n179\n00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.466\nLike all the way at the top.\n\n180\n00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:38.840\nBecause I never go that high up.\n\n181\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.630\nI always make my own folders on my Desktop\nor My Documents and whatever is default.\n\n182\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.445\nI don't normally mess with it and\ngo up that high.\n\n183\n00:09:47.445 --> 00:09:49.208\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n184\n00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:51.543\nthat actually drives home a good point.\n\n185\n00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:54.760\nLs actually says,\nwhatever directory you're in.\n\n186\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.750\n&gt;&gt; We just happen to\nbe in the home folder.\n\n187\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.960\nIt's not the home folder explicitly,\nthat's the directory we're in.\n\n188\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.225\nAnd well, that's kind of a weird,\n\n189\n00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:08.360\nnuanced behavior that maybe is not\nimmediately transparent, so to speak.\n\n190\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, like you said,\nit's where we're at right now.\n\n191\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.350\nAnd I'm looking around relative\nto where I'm at right now.\n\n192\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.130\nI'm sure you're gonna show us how to,\n\n193\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.300\nif I get into the Documents folder,\nthen any subfolders or\n\n194\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.750\nthings that I created in the Documents\nfolder would show up with that ls command.\n\n195\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and as a matter of fact,\n\n196\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.620\nI think that's a wonderful segue\non how to accomplish that.\n\n197\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.780\nSo I'm just gonna close this out,\nthat untitled folder is fine.\n\n198\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.000\nBut I'm gonna zoom back in a little bit.\n\n199\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.150\nI don't think I have many things\ninside of the Documents folder.\n\n200\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.770\nBut let's say that I'm like, okay,\n\n201\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.040\nI've looked around, I see the Documents\nfolder, I need to go into that folder.\n\n202\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.170\nI need to move into that folder, so\n\n203\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:56.340\nI'm gonna type cd, which means\nchange directory, change directory.\n\n204\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.590\nAnd then I'm going to go into Documents.\n\n205\n00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.930\nNow you'll notice that it looked like\nI typed that wicked fast, right?\n\n206\n00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.130\nSo I'm gonna back up, cd, and\nI'm gonna type it all out.\n\n207\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.800\nDocuments.\n\n208\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.670\nAnd if you ever see a trailing slash\nlike that, that's saying, hey,\n\n209\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.350\nthat's a directory.\n\n210\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.940\nThat's a folder.\n\n211\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.260\nBut the question is,\nhow did I type that so fast?\n\n212\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.050\nWell, here's a nice little helper\n\n213\n00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.950\nwhen you're in the command line\ninterface inside of your terminal.\n\n214\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.150\nMost of the time, not always,\nsometimes they're very minimal systems.\n\n215\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:33.360\nNotice how D-o-c is the beginning\nof Documents, but nothing else.\n\n216\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.600\nIt is unique.\n\n217\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.540\nAt this point, if I hit tab, it will\nauto complete to the end of that word.\n\n218\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.770\n&gt;&gt; This is just like an Excel when you\nfind the same entry in the same column and\n\n219\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.810\nyou start typing, it's like,\nthat's it and you hit the tab,\n\n220\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.580\nit will automatically pop,\nthe autocorrect.\n\n221\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.985\nI'm an Office person, so that's why I'm\nequating it to those types of things.\n\n222\n00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you could think of it\nas autocomplete, and a lot times,\n\n223\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.432\nI kinda spam that button,\nbecause I'm like d.\n\n224\n00:12:02.432 --> 00:12:08.550\nBut now notice D-o-c, D-o-w,\nthose are not unique.\n\n225\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.075\nIf I hit Tab, and I hit Tab a lot,\nit'll say, hey, this is what I know,\n\n226\n00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:17.550\nD-o is the beginning of these two\nfolder names, or it could be files.\n\n227\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.990\nWhich one do you want?\n\n228\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.100\nYou type a c and you hit Tab, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.620\n&gt;&gt; So it kinda is limiting your fields.\n\n230\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.884\nSo if you had a whole bunch of\nfolders that started with D-o-c or\n\n231\n00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:33.900\nD-o, then it's like, I don't wanna look\nat this long list of stuff, just these.\n\n232\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that is important to know,\nbecause that can be a little frustrating.\n\n233\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.600\nTypos are rough in this environment.\n\n234\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.840\nYou mistype something,\nit'll say this folder doesn't exist.\n\n235\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.000\nIf it's a small typo,\nmaybe it's a long folder name,\n\n236\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.280\nyou'll go, it does exist, I know it does.\n\n237\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.250\nBut you've transposed, in documents,\nlet's say the c and the o.\n\n238\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.510\nYou mistyped it, you're in a hurry and\nnow you're frustrated.\n\n239\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.610\nSo keep in mind,\nTab is your autocomplete friend.\n\n240\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.460\nSo I'm now inside of this Document,\nand you go,\n\n241\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:11.200\nwell, I just moved inside of Documents,\nexcuse me, the folder.\n\n242\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.160\nAnd now, okay,\nwell I kinda know where I am.\n\n243\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.880\nIf I wanted to double make sure,\npwd, print working directory.\n\n244\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.440\nI'm now in Users/devpro/Documents.\n\n245\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.480\nNow I wanna take a look around.\n\n246\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.510\nSo ls, and there's nothing in there.\n\n247\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.380\nJust says no, there's nothing in it.\n\n248\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Is it only looking for folders,\nor is it showing files too?\n\n249\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.270\n&gt;&gt; It will show files if\nthere are files in there.\n\n250\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.100\nAnd we're actually getting ready\nto jump to a directory that\n\n251\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.220\nis guaranteed to have stuff in it,\na lot of stuff.\n\n252\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.350\nBut I wanted to start simple because these\nare probably not gonna have nearly as many\n\n253\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.870\nas system level folders and files.\n\n254\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.510\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember if you had\nalready said file, I think you did.\n\n255\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.861\nBut then I just wanted to clarify to\nmake sure I knew what was going on.\n\n256\n00:13:55.861 --> 00:13:57.776\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so folders and files.\n\n257\n00:13:57.776 --> 00:14:03.210\nWe've just not been in a directory\nthat has a particular, excuse me.\n\n258\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.030\nA set of files.\n\n259\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.170\nIt's only had folders.\n\n260\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.086\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know, I thought it\nwould put Documents after devpro,\n\n261\n00:14:08.086 --> 00:14:10.858\ncuz it's like computer,\nthen the user, then the documents.\n\n262\n00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:17.100\nBut it doesn't go that way, cuz devpro is\nthe user of these folders on the computer.\n\n263\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.131\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n264\n00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:21.590\nyou're you're talking about this changing?\n\n265\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; So Documents/devpro.\n\n266\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.970\nSo this is the user name, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.270\nAnd then, this is where we are.\n\n268\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo anytime you keep going down in your\n\n269\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.120\ndirectories, home,\nDocuments keep going, keep going,\n\n270\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.050\nkeep going,\nit's just gonna go after the colon.\n\n271\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n272\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.170\nBut those are nice little\nnuances to keep in mind.\n\n273\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.280\nNow there's nothing in here so I got\ninside of a folder that I don't want, but\n\n274\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.330\nwe are running out of real estate here, so\n\n275\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:55.120\nI'd really like to maybe jump my\ncursor back, clear out what I've done.\n\n276\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.350\nNot clear on all of my history,\njust clear the screen so\n\n277\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.230\nI can get rid of all of this output and\ncome back to the top.\n\n278\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.110\nWell, that's actually pretty easy.\n\n279\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.620\nYou just type clear and\nit comes back to the top and\n\n280\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.110\nclears out the previous output.\n\n281\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.460\nWe haven't changed directories.\n\n282\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.440\nWe're not anywhere different.\n\n283\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.310\nWe haven't updated anything.\n\n284\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.700\nWe've just cleared the screen.\n\n285\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.100\n&gt;&gt; This isn't an undo.\n\n286\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.440\n&gt;&gt; This is not an undo.\n\n287\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.910\nIf you do something bad, and\nyou type clear, it still happened.\n\n288\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.820\nIt's not like you were like, abort.\n\n289\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.060\n&gt;&gt; Stay where I'm at right now, and\nthen just move this up to the top and\n\n290\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.000\nget rid of everything else.\n\n291\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, get rid of all\nof the output on the screen.\n\n292\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.460\nSo I'm inside of this Documents folder,\nand I'm like, there's nothing there,\n\n293\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.540\nthat's not where I wanna go.\n\n294\n00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.040\nI need to go back up a directory,\nback out of a folder,\n\n295\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.010\nit's kind of like hitting the back button.\n\n296\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.165\nWell, how do I do that?\n\n297\n00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:46.160\nWell, cd space dot dot.\n\n298\n00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.170\nDot dot means go up.\n\n299\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.066\nWhat do I mean, up?\n\n300\n00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:54.861\nI mean here, /Users/devpro/Documents.\n\n301\n00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:59.210\nIf I go up I'm going back,\nso dot dot means go back, so\n\n302\n00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:04.161\ncd dot dot and now if I look at\nthe present working directory.\n\n303\n00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.240\nI have users devpro.\n\n304\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.714\nI've come out of that folder back into the\nfolder that contains the folder documents\n\n305\n00:16:09.714 --> 00:16:11.740\nand that would be devpro.\n\n306\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.350\nSo those are nice little\ncommands to navigate,\n\n307\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.060\npresent working directory, LS, and CD.\n\n308\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.890\nBut I do want to jump somewhere that has,\nand\n\n309\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.572\nwe're not going to hurt\nanything doing this.\n\n310\n00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:26.188\nI'm gonna jump around a little bit and\n\n311\n00:16:26.188 --> 00:16:31.271\nlet's just go to cd/ because sometimes\nyou'll end up here by accident.\n\n312\n00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:34.016\nAnd you cd/ and you hit Enter and\n\n313\n00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:39.414\nnotice the little tilde turns\ninto a slash and you go what?\n\n314\n00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:42.390\nAnd so this is where I am.\n\n315\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.920\nWhere am I present\n[INAUDIBLE] you're at slash.\n\n316\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.540\nI didn't know that was a valid option.\n\n317\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.510\nLS, I look around and\n\n318\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.720\nnow I have all of these folders that\nare actually system level folders.\n\n319\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.160\nThis is where your operating system and\nall of that fun stuff lives.\n\n320\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.900\nBe very careful.\n\n321\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.060\nWe're not going to mess anything up here,\nbut\n\n322\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.710\nnotice I have that Users folder\nthat I can go back down into.\n\n323\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.930\nBut I just want to poke around,\njust navigate a little bit.\n\n324\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.905\nSo I'm gonna to cd into etc.\n\n325\n00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:17.920\nAnd now I am going to ls again.\n\n326\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.580\nAnd here I have, is that folders and\nfiles and all kind of stuff?\n\n327\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.170\nIf you're getting scared,\nit's perfectly okay.\n\n328\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.321\nThis is just to demonstrate\nthat we have folders and files.\n\n329\n00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:27.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like,\nI'm like I feel like we're somewhere we\n\n330\n00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:28.552\nshouldn't be right now.\n\n331\n00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:31.970\nAnd I'm getting like,\nthis could get really messy.\n\n332\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.370\n&gt;&gt; This could get really messy but I'm\ngonna show you an, I'm kinda putting you\n\n333\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.640\non a level of discomfort so\nI can show you an abort mechanism also.\n\n334\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.670\n&gt;&gt; So no worries, we haven't\nlearned any commands that are bad.\n\n336\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.824\nIf you're just CDing or LSing or PWDing,\nthose are non destructive commands.\n\n337\n00:17:48.824 --> 00:17:51.991\nso don't get all [SOUND] where am I,\nwhere am I?\n\n338\n00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:56.006\n&gt;&gt; But that tilda to the slash it's almost\nlike you went up into the harddrive or\n\n339\n00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:56.704\nsomething?\n\n340\n00:17:56.704 --> 00:17:57.922\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly-\n&gt;&gt; You went up.\n\n341\n00:17:57.922 --> 00:18:01.775\n&gt;&gt; I went up,\nI went to the very beginning of my files.\n\n342\n00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:03.739\nRight, all files and\nfolders start at that slash.\n\n343\n00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:10.201\nSo this is called the root of your hard\ndrive or kind of the starting point.\n\n344\n00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:13.395\nSo if I LS, it's kind of hard to tell.\n\n345\n00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:15.185\nAre these folders, files?\n\n346\n00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:16.065\nWhat are they?\n\n347\n00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:21.330\nWell, here it's really hard to\ndetermine what am I looking at, right?\n\n348\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.670\nSo along with a lot of these commands, and\n\n349\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.680\nI'm gonna zoom out just a little bit,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.860\nAlong with a lot of these commands\nI can add what are called flags\n\n351\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.890\nthat will let me tweak certain things.\n\n352\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.640\nThese are command specific.\n\n353\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.610\nLS is probably the first\none that we can get to.\n\n354\n00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.800\nI'm going to clear the screen.\n\n355\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:47.208\nI'm going to type ls space dash la, okay?\n\n356\n00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:52.290\nList, so ls list dash l,\nas a top to bottom list,\n\n357\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.180\nnot kinda piled like we've been seeing,\nright?\n\n358\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.220\nI've had two columns and\nthen A means all of them, everything,\n\n359\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.720\nbecause there are hidden things on your\nfile system from time to time, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.050\nSo I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n361\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.768\nAnd you go [SOUND].\n\n362\n00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:07.880\nNow what does that give me?\n\n363\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.400\nThat gives me a little more of an output,\nokay?\n\n364\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.630\nThat gives me,\ndon't worry about these parts.\n\n365\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.430\nIt gives me these three columns.\n\n366\n00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.970\nThose columns are because each row is now\npart of that list command, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.490\n&gt;&gt; This is like getting into the details\nview of whatever operating system like\n\n368\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.570\nFinder.\n\n369\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.990\nInstead of just showing the icons,\n\n370\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:36.730\nI want all the details of my files\nthe day it was created, all that stuff.\n\n371\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.260\nI'm always using that view.\n\n372\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.768\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nit is more of a detailed view And\n\n373\n00:19:41.768 --> 00:19:45.803\nit also will list anything that is\nhidden because there are ways to hide.\n\n374\n00:19:45.803 --> 00:19:50.212\nNow, how do I determine whether\nsomething is a directory or not?\n\n375\n00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:54.351\nWell, if you come over\nhere to the last column,\n\n376\n00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:58.399\nsee that D right there\nin the left most column?\n\n377\n00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:03.990\nThat D if there's a D there, that means\nthat it is a folder, or a directory.\n\n378\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.780\nIf it's not there, then it's a file.\n\n379\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.680\nSo we have folders and files and\nLS actually shows all of them.\n\n380\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.490\nNow if you're wondering what is apache2,\n\n381\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.465\nwhat is asl.conf or,\ndon't worry about those.\n\n382\n00:20:18.465 --> 00:20:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Isn't apache a server?\n\n383\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.060\n&gt;&gt; Apache is a server, there you go.\n\n384\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.385\n&gt;&gt; The little I know.\n[LAUGH].\n\n385\n00:20:24.385 --> 00:20:26.019\n&gt;&gt; You're like, what are you doing Justin?\n\n386\n00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:28.075\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm really scared right now.\n\n387\n00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:29.374\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So if you ever get here,\n\n388\n00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:31.822\nI knew there was a lot of folders and\nfiles in here so\n\n389\n00:20:31.822 --> 00:20:33.900\nI wanted to show you this list view.\n\n390\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.520\nIf you ever get into this\npanic mode where you're like,\n\n391\n00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.258\nI don't, I just wanna go back home.\n\n392\n00:20:38.258 --> 00:20:39.122\nI need to go home.\n\n393\n00:20:39.122 --> 00:20:43.670\nAll right, so I'm gonna clear and\nmy present working directory is this.\n\n394\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.220\nAnd you're like, how do I get home?\n\n395\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.147\n&gt;&gt; Just want to get back to that tilde.\n\n396\n00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:48.181\nI felt comfortable with tilde.\n\n397\n00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:51.185\n&gt;&gt; So, cd and then nothing else.\n\n398\n00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:51.685\nJust hit enter.\n\n399\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.070\nSo if you type cd and\nhit enter, it'll take you home.\n\n400\n00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.370\nIt's like clicking your heels and\nsaying there's no place like home.\n\n401\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.690\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how far down,\nor how far up,\n\n402\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.020\nor no matter where you're at,\njust type cd.\n\n403\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.968\nYou'll always get back to tilde?\n\n404\n00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:08.326\n&gt;&gt; Cd, enter.\n\n405\n00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:09.510\nCd and nothing else.\n\n406\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.087\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's pretty quick too.\n\n407\n00:21:11.087 --> 00:21:11.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty quick.\n\n408\n00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:14.590\nSo that's kind of your escape hatch,\nright?\n\n409\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.710\nPull the lever, parachute, boom.\n\n410\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.740\nYou're good to go.\n\n411\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.200\nAnd well, if you have those\nthree commands then you can,\n\n412\n00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.020\nit may take some getting used to,\neffectively navigate.\n\n413\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.310\nPWD tells you, where am I right now?\n\n414\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.510\nLS is, what is around me?\n\n415\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.048\nCD is, change directory, or\nchange where I am, okay?\n\n416\n00:21:34.048 --> 00:21:37.850\nSo those three things, and\nthere are some slight modifications.\n\n417\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.584\nRemember CD space..\n\n418\n00:21:39.584 --> 00:21:43.330\nwill get me out of a folder and\ngo backwards.\n\n419\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.530\nCD folder name will take\nme into the folder.\n\n420\n00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.780\nCD by itself will take me home.\n\n421\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.880\nAnd well, LS, you can add that dash\nla flag to get a list of everything,\n\n422\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.650\nincluding what kinda thing it is,\nits modified view, the details view,\n\n423\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.840\neffectively.\n\n424\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.000\nAnd as long as we know those,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n425\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.720\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is\nthe right place to ask this, but\n\n426\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.380\nthe dot dot is up one level.\n\n427\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.940\nIf I know I needed to go two levels,\ndo I have to commit,\n\n428\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.600\ngo up one, then go up again or\ncan I combine them?\n\n429\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.120\nCan you be like dot dot space dot dot?\n\n430\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.240\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n431\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.710\nAnd as a matter of fact let's\njust do that real quick.\n\n432\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.627\nBecause that's a perfect into it.\n\n433\n00:22:28.627 --> 00:22:30.870\nBecause like if I can go up one folder,\nhow do I go up two?\n\n434\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.770\nThat's a perfect extension\nof what I've just shown you.\n\n435\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.310\n&gt;&gt; Or go down two,\n\n436\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.600\nbecause I know there's a folder inside\nthe documents because I didn't know if.\n\n437\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.090\n&gt;&gt; So let's go up and we'll circle back\naround to how to move into multiple\n\n438\n00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.830\nfolders when we know\nthere's full folder depth.\n\n439\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.250\nSo if I wanna go up to, let's go to slash.\n\n440\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.610\nI wanna go up two folders, right?\n\n441\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:55.702\nInstead of cd to slash,\nI could do dot dot slash dot dot.\n\n442\n00:22:55.702 --> 00:23:01.531\nThat says go up one folder,\ntwo folders, and then I hit enter.\n\n443\n00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:06.495\nNot a space, but ../../..,\nyou can change that ad\n\n444\n00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:11.580\nnauseum until you got all the back\nup to the very top, right?\n\n445\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.140\nIt's kinda like climbing a tree,\nbranch by branch by branch by branch.\n\n446\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but you don't put a slash.\n\n447\n00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.874\nIt's not ../../?\n\n448\n00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.033\nOr would that work to or is that a small?\n\n449\n00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:23.560\n&gt;&gt; That will actually work.\n\n450\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.400\nSo I'm just going to go home.\n\n451\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:31.620\nMy abort mechanism ../../, that trailing\nslash says hey this is a folder.\n\n452\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.810\nLet's see what happens.\n\n453\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.980\nAnd I still get to that top level folder.\n\n454\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.210\nI'm really cavalier about\nleaving off that trailing slash.\n\n455\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Is there a reason?\n\n456\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.132\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm lazy.\n\n457\n00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:46.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's no other reason, but\n\n458\n00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.000\nwe've now taken a command that we knew and\nkind of thought through the process.\n\n459\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.518\nMaybe you wouldn't have got the slash.\n\n460\n00:23:52.518 --> 00:23:56.620\nBut you were like I need two dot dots,\nand that's perfectly okay.\n\n461\n00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.830\nBut now that we can navigate, well we\nprobably wanna do other things, but\n\n462\n00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.450\nmaybe that's best left to another episode.\n\n463\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean,\nit's always a good place to start.\n\n464\n00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.223\nYou gotta know how to get\naround when you're in this.\n\n465\n00:24:08.223 --> 00:24:13.111\nAnd I'm just equating it to everything\nI do through my regular finder,\n\n466\n00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:15.640\nor Windows Explorer, or whatever.\n\n467\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.970\nAnd it's kinda neat to\nsee the command line,\n\n468\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.070\nso I'm pretty excited about\nwhere we're going next, Justin.\n\n469\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.370\nI'm glad I'm your host so\nI can ask you all these crazy questions.\n\n470\n00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.099\nBut it's been fun, so\nI'm looking forward to it.\n\n471\n00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:31.140\nI hope you all learned a lot, but we're\ngoing to go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n472\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.224\nSigning off for DevProTV.\n\n473\n00:24:32.224 --> 00:24:33.214\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n474\n00:24:33.214 --> 00:24:34.235\n&gt;&gt;

DevPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.793\nI'm your host Von smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:21.982\nwe're moving on in our getting\ntechnical with the terminal series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd in this episode, we're going to be\nmaking some files and some folders.\n\n6\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.540\nAnd here to help us crack all these\nwonderful things is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.860\nHello, how are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Vonne.\n\n8\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.488\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:36.230\nI'm feeling pretty confident about\neverything we've done so far.\n\n10\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.910\nWe're just starting out [LAUGH] so\nthat's, maybe not saying much but\n\n11\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.460\nit was nice to kinda get our\nfeet wet with the terminal.\n\n12\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.910\nAnd now, we're gonna move on to\n\n13\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.144\nmaking some more stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.930\nwe're going to make a few more things.\n\n15\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.810\nAnd I think this series should really be\nthought of just how you thought of it.\n\n16\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.930\nI just need to get my feet wet.\n\n17\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.550\nI just need to know enough to get by\nbecause really, we could spend weeks\n\n18\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.016\ntalking about all the commands that\nare available within the Shell,\n\n19\n00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:07.419\n[INAUDIBLE] our inter terminal apps.\n\n20\n00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:11.257\nAll these things that we could do but\nultimately, our goal is to become\n\n21\n00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:15.175\nproficient enough to where our\ndevelopment workflow is expeditious.\n\n22\n00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.830\nSo, you can keep it in mind,\nl want to reiterate,\n\n23\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.620\nthis is not kind of an all inclusive\nfull look at everything that you can do.\n\n24\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.420\nIt's enough to get you started and\nhelp us move forward.\n\n25\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.670\nSo, what are we gonna do today?\n\n26\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.809\nWell, last episode, we actually saw how\nto navigate around, how to look around.\n\n27\n00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:36.850\nHow to tell where we are but\nwe ran into some problems.\n\n28\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.880\nWe had to get into this weird directory\nthat Von got really nervous about,\n\n29\n00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.150\nand that's because we could not\nmake our own folders and files.\n\n30\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.480\nAnd well, that is something you will need\nto do as you start down this development\n\n31\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.330\nwork kind of a split path,\n\n32\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.890\nso to to speak, this journey.\n&gt;&gt; This is obviously the first thing you\n\n33\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.090\ndo with any project.\n\n34\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.411\nIf I'm going to be creating a work for\na client, I'm gonna make a folder and\n\n35\n00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:59.540\nsay like, client work.\n\n36\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.529\nAnd then maybe make some subfolders and\nput a file in there, maybe like a Word,\n\n37\n00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.337\nI would use a Word document because I'm\nan Office person, make my notes and\n\n38\n00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:08.320\nthings like that.\n\n39\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.870\nSo it's all the same things that we\ndo in our regular GUI interface,\n\n40\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.210\nwe're just gonna see it\nin the command line,\n\n41\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.856\naren't we?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n42\n00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:18.789\nAnd we do have some,\nyou said something very interesting.\n\n43\n00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.429\nI would probably use a Word document.\n\n44\n00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.420\nWell, I can't remember\nthe last time I've actually\n\n45\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.160\nused Word.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Because I use very plain text formats\n\n47\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.470\nthat I use tools to kind of parse\nthrough and manipulate for me.\n\n48\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.230\nIt's all about the difference\nof workflows, but\n\n49\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.920\nI could technically make a document\nthat had a Word extension like .DOCX.\n\n50\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.612\nThat would allow me to have\nlike a placeholder and\n\n51\n00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:44.195\nprovide kind of my impetus.\n\n52\n00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:48.580\nDo keep in mind, maybe not\nthe standard use case but is possible.\n\n53\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.640\nBut we've talked enough, I think it's now\nimportant to see how do we make folders,\n\n54\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.120\nhow do we make files in them?\n\n55\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.930\nAnd ultimately,\nhow do we use this to set up our project?\n\n56\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.640\nMaybe we won't get to that on this episode\nbut it is important to remember these\n\n57\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.480\nsmall little skills that will\ncompose into more complex workflows.\n\n58\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.176\nSo lets go ahead and take at the screen\nhere and just a blank Desktop.\n\n59\n00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:08.114\nI will tell you,\n\n60\n00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:12.990\nthis is the probably the cleanest my\nDesktop has ever been during these shows.\n\n61\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.320\nBut I'm trying to get away from\nstoring everything on my Desktop,\n\n62\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.030\nbut that's just me.\n&gt;&gt; You're one of those too?\n\n63\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.350\nI am so bad at that.\n\n64\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.167\nEverybody around me is just like,\nwhy do you have all that on your Desktop?\n\n65\n00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.390\nAnd I'm like, because I put it there and\nthen I file it away later.\n\n66\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.700\nIt's not like I keep everything\non there all the time, I mean,\n\n67\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.412\nit's like my working projects.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I\n\n68\n00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:34.250\ntell myself.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.\n\n69\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.120\n&gt;&gt; And then I just get stacks,\n\n70\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.120\nand stacks of icons and\nI'm like I don't know.\n\n71\n00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.700\nSo I'm trying to get away from that and\nstart using the Documents folder or\n\n72\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.440\ntools like Dropbox or things like that.\n\n73\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.360\nTo store them away so this computer\ncould catch on fire today and\n\n74\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.340\nI would probably be all right.\n\n75\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.980\nHopefully, that doesn't happen and\n\n76\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.480\nit shouldn't because we are not\ngonna do anything that destructive.\n\n77\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.780\nNow, before we carry on, we need to\nremember that's command space bar.\n\n78\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.020\nIf you are on a Mac, that would be super\nkey or typically the Windows key for\n\n79\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.010\nLinux and then, also for Windows.\n\n80\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.990\nThe Windows will open up a search toolbar,\nand you can go and\n\n81\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.210\nfind the respective application.\n\n82\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.510\nEven if you're not using the Terminal,\nthat is kind of a pro tip,\n\n83\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.470\nit'll help you along in your workflows.\n\n84\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.340\nAll right, so I open the Terminal and\n\n85\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.920\nnow I have my little\nTerminal environment open.\n\n86\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.179\nSo, the very first thing that I always do\nis just to make sure there isn't some kind\n\n87\n00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:28.741\nof weird hiccup, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:30.160\nSo, where am I?\n\n89\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.510\nWell, I'm in Users devpro.\n\n90\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.050\nThat's my home folder.\n\n91\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.280\nNow we learned that last episode,\nso print working directory.\n\n92\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.920\nThat's where we are.\n\n93\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.590\nI'm gonna take a look around.\n\n94\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.500\nAll right, there we go.\n\n95\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.570\nNow for this episode,\n\n96\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.750\nI am actually going to go to the Desktop\njust to start playing around.\n\n97\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.690\nSo we can see them without having\nto navigate through the Finder and\n\n98\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.470\nthings of that nature.\n\n99\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.970\nSo I'm gonna hop into the Desktop.\n\n100\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.870\nSo, cd Desktop.\n\n101\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.070\nRemember, that's change\ndirectory into the Desktop.\n\n102\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.460\nAnd now, I'm gonna look around and\nthere's nothing there.\n\n103\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.030\nAnd you're like, but that's really\nwhere I wanna start my project.\n\n104\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.860\nVon is like,\nthat's really where I wanna start things.\n\n105\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.920\nAnd, well, typically,\nwe create folders to group, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.890\nOur folder structure are ways to group,\nnot only on a top level.\n\n107\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.530\nWhat do I mean by a top level?\n\n108\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.810\nOur starting folder,\nbut also folders within\n\n109\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.840\nin order to have an appropriate\ndivision that makes sense to us.\n\n110\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.980\nNow, in the long term,\nyou may have recommendations for\n\n111\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.620\nrespective projects but some of it\nis a little bit of your decision.\n\n112\n00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.540\nThat's ultimately not our work,\nwe don't care about that today.\n\n113\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.820\nWe just wanna make a folder.\n\n114\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.580\nSo, let's make a folder or\n\n115\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.210\na directory that is called,\nlets just call it, test, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.600\nSo we're testing this out.\n\n117\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.390\nWe'll see how things go along.\n\n118\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.510\nSo, mkdir or\n\n119\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.140\nmake dir is how I like to say it because\nit reminds, I'm making a directory.\n\n120\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.300\nMake dir.\n\n121\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.790\nAnd it's also fun to say.\n\n122\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.960\nIf you don't believe me, try it out.\n\n123\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.720\nSo mkdir, and then inside of the Desktop\nfolder, I'm just gonna create test.\n\n124\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.308\nNow, remember, I ran ls and\nnothing occurred.\n\n125\n00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:07.247\nBut I'm gonna hit that, I have no errors.\n\n126\n00:06:07.247 --> 00:06:11.900\nAnd every time I do this, you will see\nme throughout anything you see me in.\n\n127\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.130\nIf I'm in the Terminal,\nI'm kind of spamming ls.\n\n128\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.458\nNow, it printed out\nweird cuz I'm zoomed in.\n\n129\n00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.451\nBut if I roll over here,\n\n130\n00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:25.570\nyou'll see I now have a test\nfolder in my Desktop directory.\n\n131\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.932\nSo I've created it as a directory\nwithin a directory and\n\n132\n00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:30.400\nthis is how your file system is arranged.\n\n133\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.140\nSo if we scroll out, Haha!\n\n134\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.264\nI was also using that to hide the fact\nthat test now kinda cropped up over here.\n\n135\n00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:42.007\nAnd that happened because of mkdir or\nmake dir.\n\n136\n00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:46.094\nNow, sometimes and when we're in\na rush and we have a repeated project,\n\n137\n00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:50.181\nthen we may want to create multiple\ndirectories inside of directories,\n\n138\n00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.595\ninside of directories.\n\n139\n00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:54.595\nVonne, do you ever create folders and\nfolders and\n\n140\n00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:57.304\nfolders?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] You should see some of my\n\n141\n00:06:57.304 --> 00:07:01.138\nwork I was just working on lunch for\ndoing some freelance work and\n\n142\n00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:05.483\nit's,- Man, I just think about,\nlike, why did I do this sometimes?\n\n143\n00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:09.070\n[LAUGH] It's so nested but\nyou have to a lot of times.\n\n144\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.400\nSo, I'm assuming we can make a folder\ninside of a folder all in one command,\n\n145\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.062\nmaybe?\n&gt;&gt; We're about to see.\n\n146\n00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:20.625\nI'm gonna take us down a path that\nis not gonna play out too well.\n\n147\n00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:24.269\nNow, just to show you what's gonna happen\nand then I'm gonna show you the solution.\n\n148\n00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:28.290\nSo, sometimes we can't appreciate\nthe solution until we feel the pain\n\n149\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.710\nthat the solution solves, all right?\n\n150\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.220\nThat is alleviated for us.\n\n151\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.140\nSo if I come back into here, and let's\nsay that inside of this test directory,\n\n152\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.650\nI wanna make another folder.\n\n153\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.220\nNow, this isn't the pain point yet.\n\n154\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.520\nSo I'm gonna go, mkdir.\n\n155\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.730\nI'm still inside of Desktop.\n\n156\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.605\nBut I'm gonna make inside of test,\n\n157\n00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:51.683\nremember I hit the Tab key that gives\nme an autocomplete based on uniqueness.\n\n158\n00:07:51.683 --> 00:07:56.004\nAnd then I want to make subfolder1, okay?\n\n159\n00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:58.187\nHorrible naming convention,\ndon't actually do this for\n\n160\n00:07:58.187 --> 00:07:59.486\nany of your projects or anything.\n\n161\n00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:03.004\nBut this is for demonstration purposes.\n\n162\n00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:05.280\nSo mkdir test/subfolder1.\n\n163\n00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.050\nI didn't actually get an error and\nwhy is that?\n\n164\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.470\nWell, let's hop inside of test.\n\n165\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.490\nSo I'm gonna change directory into test.\n\n166\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.040\nAnd I'm gonna ls.\n\n167\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.430\nAnd I actually created a folder\ninside of test by saying folder/ and\n\n168\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.360\nthen the next folder name.\n\n169\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.840\nSo I gave what's called a full\npath or- well actually,\n\n170\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.320\nit's not a true full path, because it's\na relative path based on where I am.\n\n171\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.950\nRelative, because I was already on\nthe desktop with test visible to me.\n\n172\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:40.300\nA true full path would have to be users,\ndevpro, desktop, blah, blah, blah, okay?\n\n173\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.180\nNow, you're like, okay,\nwell that's easy, I got it.\n\n174\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.720\nI got it, you can make folders in folders.\n\n175\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.250\nWell, let's say that I hop back out, and\n\n176\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.750\nagain, for demonstration purposes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n177\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.330\nthat dot dot is to go up one level\nbecause we were already in test.\n\n178\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.510\nSo we had to go back up the desktop.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n179\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.230\nSo we're getting back to the desktop\nto reset our motivation, so to speak.\n\n180\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.850\nSo I'm gonna make dir, and\nlet's say that I need a subfolder two but\n\n181\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.008\ninside of that I need a sub,\nsub folder, just for fun.\n\n182\n00:09:15.008 --> 00:09:18.860\nSo there's test/subfolder2 and\n\n183\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.895\nthen subsubfolder, so deeply nested.\n\n184\n00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.687\nThen we'll go into the finder and\ntake a look at this.\n\n185\n00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:25.232\n&gt;&gt; Okay so,\n\n186\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:28.480\nsome of it's behind your head but\nyou're saying.\n\n187\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.750\nYou're creating a sub because\nsubfolder2 has not been created and\n\n188\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.130\nsubfolder, subfolder.\n\n189\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.460\nSo we're making two at the same time.\n&gt;&gt; Well we're gonna try.\n\n190\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:43.740\nYou're gonna go, that's easy, I can make\nfolders and folders and folders and uh-oh.\n\n191\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.290\nWhat it's saying is, inside of test.\n\n192\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.272\nSo if we go over here and look.\n\n193\n00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:50.800\nMkdir: test/subfolder2: mo such file or\ndirectory.\n\n194\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.658\nIt's saying hey, inside of test,\nthere is no subfolder2 already, so\n\n195\n00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:58.697\nI cannot put an additional\nfolder within it.\n\n196\n00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:02.992\nIf we were to run this exact same command,\n\n197\n00:10:02.992 --> 00:10:07.956\ntest/subfolder1/subsubfolder like so.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n198\n00:10:07.956 --> 00:10:10.340\nwould work because it's already created.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n199\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.770\nSo if we already have that folder,\nwe can kinda drill down and\n\n200\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.860\ngive these Is longer pass and\ncreate folders like that.\n\n201\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.293\nWhat's interesting is let's\nsay that I know that I need\n\n202\n00:10:22.293 --> 00:10:26.552\na subsubfolder inside\na subfolder2 inside of test.\n\n203\n00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:28.440\nTest already exists on the desktop.\n\n204\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.240\nI don't wanna make subfolder and\n\n205\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.600\nthen run another command I could do and\nmkdir test/subfolder2.\n\n206\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.186\nAnd then make mkdir\ntest/subfolder2/subfolder/subfolder.\n\n207\n00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:42.968\nBut if I know I need all of\nthose folders nested that way,\n\n208\n00:10:42.968 --> 00:10:46.618\nmkdir actually makes it\na little easier with the -p.\n\n209\n00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:51.859\nSo mkdir space -p and\nthen you give the path\n\n210\n00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:56.519\nthat you want, sub/sub/folder and\n\n211\n00:10:56.519 --> 00:11:01.240\nlet's see here, we still see it.\n\n212\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.980\nAnd mkdir -p test/subfolder2.\n\n213\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.290\nSubfolder2 still does not exist, but\n\n214\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.656\nwe want to create a subsubfolder\ninside of subfolder2.\n\n215\n00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:12.700\nNow hit enter and it doesn't break.\n\n216\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.270\nThe -p says, just start creating\nfolders until you can make this true.\n\n217\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.410\nYeah Vonne is about to\nlose her mind off camera.\n\n218\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking\n\n219\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.510\nbecause you have to do it.\n\n220\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.170\nIf I'm got to right-click\nmake new folder rename it and\n\n221\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.560\nthen open it right click make a folder and\nall of that.\n\n222\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.990\nSo I could just come in here to\nthe terminal which I am finding is\n\n223\n00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.700\npretty simple for these little commands,\nI can just make them all.\n\n224\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n225\n00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:36.210\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, okay,\n\n226\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.860\nI'm gonna be doing this from now on.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n227\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.826\nif you have a lot of folder structures\nto make, especially with deep nesting,\n\n228\n00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:47.210\nmkdir -p, you just give it the deepest\nfolder that you need to make.\n\n229\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.205\nAnd it will make all the folders up\n\n230\n00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:50.260\nto that.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n231\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.350\n&gt;&gt; So this doesn't give a command, but\n\n232\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.310\nI may be lying to you,\nI'm not, but I could be.\n\n233\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.450\nSo let's open up test, and\nnow here we have subfolder 1, subfolder 2.\n\n234\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.930\nAnd inside of subfolder 2 I have sub/\nsubfolder and I could go crazy with this.\n\n235\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo instead of right\nclicking like Vonne said,\n\n236\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.310\nnew folder, give it a name,\nblah blah blah.\n\n237\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.588\nI can open the terminal real quick,\nget to where I need to be, [NOISE], and\n\n238\n00:12:15.588 --> 00:12:18.713\nI'm done.\n&gt;&gt; And we could have done that right from\n\n239\n00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:23.144\nthe very beginning at the desktop\nto that -p and then did test twos,\n\n240\n00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:25.728\nsubfolder one, sub/subfolder one.\n\n241\n00:12:25.728 --> 00:12:28.724\nAnd it would make all three\nof those [NOISE] all nested.\n\n242\n00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:30.561\n&gt;&gt; Yeah as a matter of fact,\n\n243\n00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:35.100\njust to prove that that is true\nlets just delete this folder.\n\n244\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.330\nLet's drag this down to the trash and\nnow let's clear the screen now.\n\n245\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.980\nAnd we're gonna watch over here\nthere is nothing there and\n\n246\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.920\nwhat's one seeing is only desktop.\n\n247\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.775\nWe need to make a test with\nsubfolder1 with the subsubfolder.\n\n248\n00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:56.048\nOkay, so mkdir -p and\nzoom in just a little bit,\n\n249\n00:12:56.048 --> 00:13:04.510\ntest/subfolder1/subsubsubfolder, boom,\nno errors.\n\n250\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.700\nAnd if I come over here, zoom out and\n\n251\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.380\nthere's subfolder one with sub/subfolder\nin it and we're all good to go.\n\n252\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.530\nSo our project's set up or anything you\nneed to re-arranged as far as folder goes\n\n253\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.350\nis really fast on the terminal.\n\n254\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.080\nThis is why I find it important\nto have at least some basic skill\n\n255\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.290\nbecause you're gonna be in here anyway so\nyou should know hey I can make folders.\n\n256\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.110\nAnd well, we should be able to make files,\n\n257\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.440\nwe haven't got there yet, but\nhow you feeling about this, Vonne?\n\n258\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.490\nIs this looking good to you?\n\n259\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.180\nIs this a little more\nattractive than it was?\n\n260\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.586\n&gt;&gt; This is so much better.\n\n261\n00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:42.204\n[LAUGH] I'm just like,\nreally because I mean to be honest,\n\n262\n00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:45.140\nthe terminal's been so scary to me.\n\n263\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.130\nThat's where you do like,\npings and loopbacks.\n\n264\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.170\nAnd yeah I'm talking like I\nknow what I'm talking about.\n\n265\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.454\nBut it's just like I see it be so\ntechnical looking, but\n\n266\n00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:57.659\njust to equating it to what I do everyday.\n\n267\n00:13:57.659 --> 00:14:02.038\nI just had to write one little line,\n[SOUND] way easier.\n\n268\n00:14:02.038 --> 00:14:05.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is why I like to use it.\n\n269\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.260\nBut also we're required to use it\nfrom time to time as a developer,\n\n270\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.510\nthere's not really any way around it.\n\n271\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.380\nYou have to be familiar with it.\n\n272\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.170\nYou might as well be familiar with\nsome of these insulator things\n\n273\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.840\nthat make your life easier.\n\n274\n00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.970\nBut now that we have these folders,\nlet's just close this out and\n\n275\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.020\nlet's hop into test, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.670\nAnd then I'm gonna scroll back in.\n\n277\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.380\nLet's say that I need a few test files or\nsome kind of extension,\n\n278\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.940\nwe can even make up the extensions.\n\n279\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.110\nThere's a command I'm gonna show\nyou that I use to make vowels\n\n280\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.030\nthat actually has a different\nmeaning in addition to, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.933\nSo let's say I'm inside of test,\nif I look around I have subfolder1.\n\n282\n00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:48.213\nBut right inside this folder I\nwanna create like a readme file,\n\n283\n00:14:48.213 --> 00:14:50.330\nlike hey, take a look at this.\n\n284\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.620\nWe'll gonna make it a .txt,\nit's just plain text.\n\n285\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.370\nSo I'm gonna say touch readme.txt,\njust like that.\n\n286\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:05.050\nSo boom and enter, and\nall I did was touch it into existence.\n\n287\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.770\nThere's nothing in it,\nso if I ls there it is.\n\n288\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.170\nIf I come and look,\nit's just a plain text file.\n\n289\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.280\nIf I open it up, it opens in textedit.\n\n290\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.330\nIt's still all good to go and\nit's pretty handy.\n\n291\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.820\nSo that's a top level file and\nyou can combine these packing.\n\n292\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.010\nLet's say I need to put a readme inside of\nsubfolder1's subfolde/subfolder, right?\n\n293\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.170\nSo I could touch subfolder1/subsubfolder/,\nand\n\n294\n00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.540\nthen another /readme.txt, just like that.\n\n295\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.550\nAnd boom, nothing errored out,\nlet's go see what happens.\n\n296\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.173\nAnd I'm showing you this graphically,\n\n297\n00:15:46.173 --> 00:15:49.045\nbecause if this is your first time\nin the terminal, you're like.\n\n298\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:55.641\nI need you to be able to equate these I\nspend very little time in finder nowadays.\n\n299\n00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:59.435\nAnd there's our other readme file that\nwe just made from the command line.\n\n300\n00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:04.166\nNow, originally touch was also used,\nif we come here to,\n\n301\n00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:08.330\nsee this date modified today at 2:14,\nright?\n\n302\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.837\nSo date modified, it is is now 2:15.\n\n303\n00:16:12.837 --> 00:16:14.457\nSome people get really scared,\n\n304\n00:16:14.457 --> 00:16:17.840\nthey're like what if I touched\na file a couple of times?\n\n305\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.090\nWell, if I touch it again.\n\n306\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.420\nNow all I did on the terminal,\n\n307\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.300\nthe terminal actually\nkeeps a cache of commands.\n\n308\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.800\nI hit the up arrow.\n\n309\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.288\nI hit the up arrow and I actually cycled\nup and down through previous commands,\n\n310\n00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:31.260\nall right?\n\n311\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.540\nSo we haven't talked about this before.\n\n312\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.595\nThis is a nice little trick.\n\n313\n00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:38.490\nIf I hit Up that's the last\ncommand that I hit Enter on.\n\n314\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.270\nI'm gonna hit, boom, there it is.\n\n315\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.040\nLook at that,\n\n316\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.520\nit actually changed to 2:15 PM.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n317\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.050\nit's not trying to create a new Readme.\n\n318\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.900\nSo I was thinking like when you try to\nsave the file with the same name and\n\n319\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.650\nit's like hey,\nsomething already exists by that name.\n\n320\n00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.530\nDo you want to not do that.\n\n321\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.930\n[LAUGH] You're not doing that.\n\n322\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.920\nThere is no overriding of it.\n&gt;&gt; The only thing that overrides is,\n\n323\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.180\nthere is a few metadata properties\nwhere mostly what you will see\n\n324\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.750\nis the date modified,\nthe last modified date.\n\n325\n00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.970\nIf you touch it,\nit will change the last modified date.\n\n326\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.990\nAnd that occurs with any\napplication that you use.\n\n327\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.170\nIf you open up a Word document,\nyou modify it and\n\n328\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.550\nyou save, it's the last modified that\ngets updated for that respective file.\n\n329\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:27.210\nIf you touch a file twice, you're just\nmodifying the last modified date.\n\n330\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.980\nThere are some interesting tricks where\nI can actually set it in the past.\n\n331\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.217\nAnd I'm not gonna you those because I\ndon't think it's really necessary at this\n\n332\n00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:37.624\njuncture.\n&gt;&gt; It's funny because I was gonna ask,\n\n333\n00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:41.659\nwhat if you tried to make another Readme\nfile and it's gonna not let you cuz you\n\n334\n00:17:41.659 --> 00:17:45.942\ncan't have the same file name within the\nsame directory because you used Readme,\n\n335\n00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:47.830\nbut it was in a separate directory.\n\n336\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.500\nSo I'm like it's not gonna bark at you.\n\n337\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.110\nBut again,\nI'm more used to using the finder and\n\n338\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:58.030\nnot the terminal environment.\n&gt;&gt; And just to drive that home, and\n\n339\n00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.700\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nVonne, cuz I think I got you.\n\n340\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.320\nWe got Readme inside a sub-subfolder, but\n\n341\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.670\nwe also have Readme inside of\ntest at the top level of test.\n\n342\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.090\nI can reuse that file name because\nthey're nested in different folders.\n\n343\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.900\nSo from the computer's perspective,\nthose are different files paths and\n\n344\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.580\nthat's perfectly okay.\n\n345\n00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.306\nUsing touch, I could not, and\nactually using any other application,\n\n346\n00:18:21.306 --> 00:18:25.261\nI could not have readme.txt and\nreadme.txt, all right?\n\n347\n00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:29.788\nI do wanna draw attention to one thing\nthat I did that I think kind of got lost\n\n348\n00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:30.930\nover there.\n\n349\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.692\nNotice I have put .txt as\nthe file extension, all right?\n\n350\n00:18:35.692 --> 00:18:41.053\nThe file extension associates programs\non your computer with a respective file.\n\n351\n00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:44.850\nI chose .txt because I\nknow that's plain text.\n\n352\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:50.450\nBut let's see if I can do\nsomething crazy like create\n\n353\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.676\nan image file using this,\nlike a .png, right?\n\n354\n00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:59.751\nNow this is not something you\nwould necessarily do, but\n\n355\n00:18:59.751 --> 00:19:03.340\nI wanna drive home\nthe importance of loop.png.\n\n356\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.800\nSo I'm putting it inside of test, right?\n\n357\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.587\nWe're not going further deeper into\nthe folder structure, touch look.png, and\n\n358\n00:19:10.587 --> 00:19:11.640\nI hit Enter.\n\n359\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.220\nIt didn't bark at me,\nit didn't say no, you can't do that.\n\n360\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.600\nWhen I come back out and look,\nit recognizes that there's a .png file.\n\n361\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.276\nBecause those file extensions,\nit's how your computer makes associations.\n\n362\n00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:28.270\nHowever, if you open it up, it's empty.\n\n363\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.500\nThere's nothing in it.\n\n364\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.840\nJust because you can use a file extension\n\n365\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.680\ndoesn't mean you should\nuse a file extension.\n\n366\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.171\nSo like pngs and jpgs and things,\nyou'll get weird errors because there's no\n\n367\n00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:45.100\ninformation about an image inside.\n&gt;&gt; I was actually wondering if you did,\n\n368\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.890\ncuz I was working in InDesign over lunch.\n\n369\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.910\nI was like,\ncould you make a .indb file and\n\n370\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.570\nthen open it from the finder and\nthen it associates itself with.\n\n371\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.052\nBut I mean, there's so many properties of\nmaking an InDesign file when you do a File\n\n372\n00:19:59.052 --> 00:20:02.120\n&gt; New, and none of that\ninformation would be in there.\n\n373\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.590\nSo I was just curious if it would\nunderstand and be able to be used.\n\n374\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.970\nI think you're kinda demonstrating\nthe point right here with the png.\n\n375\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.120\n&gt;&gt; You may get some weirdness here,\n\n376\n00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.140\nbut to further drive down on file\nextensions, what's going on.\n\n377\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.050\nSo, graphics?\n\n378\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.350\nThere has to be something in there for\na display, right?\n\n379\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.090\nBut if I'm not mistaken, I am actually\ngoing to hit Cmd+Space bar and see.\n\n380\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.440\nI have Microsoft Word on this computer.\n\n381\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.797\nI'm going to make a .docx,\nwhich is a Word document.\n\n382\n00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:34.468\nIf you don't use Word,\nthat's perfectly okay.\n\n383\n00:20:34.468 --> 00:20:38.893\nIt's just I'm taking a file extension that\nI know is associated with a proprietary\n\n384\n00:20:38.893 --> 00:20:40.479\napplication on my computer.\n\n385\n00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:46.230\nSo I'm gonna come back in here and\nsay touch and let's create readme.docx.\n\n386\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.610\nIt's still a Readme, but\nit has a different file extension,\n\n387\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.310\nso it has a different file name, okay?\n\n388\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.520\nSo those are different.\n\n389\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.290\nTouch looks good, and\nnow it's associated as a Word document.\n\n390\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.880\nIf I double-click it and\nopen it, let's see what happens.\n\n391\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.569\nI may get something weird like you\nneed to update your Word or whatever.\n\n392\n00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:08.057\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; You have not opened this program.\n\n393\n00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:08.916\n&gt;&gt; Different user account,\n\n394\n00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:11.567\ndifferent user account.\n&gt;&gt; Now you have to sign in.\n\n395\n00:21:11.567 --> 00:21:14.260\n&gt;&gt; So let's see if I can.\n\n396\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.722\nKeynote, I don't know any of\nthese other file extensions.\n\n397\n00:21:17.722 --> 00:21:19.381\nYou know what?\n\n398\n00:21:19.381 --> 00:21:24.516\nLet's try readme.pdf.\n\n399\n00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:27.374\nSo I just made a .pdf,\nit's just still an image.\n\n400\n00:21:27.374 --> 00:21:30.550\nAnd I'm gonna open up readme.,\nit's still empty.\n\n401\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.012\nAnd there is an association,\nsometimes you can get away with this,\n\n402\n00:21:35.012 --> 00:21:36.400\nall right?\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say,\n\n403\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.590\nit must be very specific\nto each file type,\n\n404\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.680\nand what it needs is the bare minimum\nto open it or be able to understand it.\n\n405\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.160\nThat's what I'm thinking,\nwith the InDesign,\n\n406\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.780\nyeah, it's gonna show you the icons and\nwhat's associated with it.\n\n407\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.370\nBut it might just be like hm.\n\n408\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:57.470\nBut with Word or the docx,\nit's still a text document.\n\n409\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.600\nIt's just like a really\nsouped-up text document.\n\n410\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.640\nSo maybe that's what.\n\n411\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.210\nIt's like, this one would be okay.\n\n412\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.830\nBut not some crazy Adobe product or\n\n413\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.410\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly right.\n\n414\n00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.440\nYou can get away with this sometimes, and\n\n415\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.660\nif I'm not mistaken and just because\nthis is a different user account\n\n416\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.290\nthat I'm making sure everything's clean,\nso we're all at the same starting point.\n\n417\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.900\nI'm signed into Word so I can't open Word.\n\n418\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.730\nBut I haven't done this before.\n\n419\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.280\nAnd what happens is Word\nkinda updates some of that\n\n420\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.310\nbehind the scenes information\nthat you don't see.\n\n421\n00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.750\nNow this is when I tried it.\n\n422\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.750\nYour mileage may vary, depending on\nyour version of Word and your system and\n\n423\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.000\nthings of that nature.\n\n424\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.830\nSo this would open, but then this 0 bytes.\n\n425\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.570\nSee how this says 0?\n&gt;&gt; There's no\n\n426\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.470\ninformation there.\n&gt;&gt; There's\n\n427\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.680\nno information.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n428\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.960\n&gt;&gt; So once that happens,\n\n429\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.220\nyou'll probably see information.\n\n430\n00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.390\nDo keep in mind, I would stick to plain\ntext documents for this creation.\n\n431\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.500\nNow they may have different file\nextensions, but I'm saying you can't have\n\n432\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:01.950\nlike I have a table with bold text and\nthis is red, and I'll have images in it.\n\n433\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.160\nBe careful,\n\n434\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.210\nif you touch those again, you change\nthe modified date which is different.\n\n435\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.620\nBut that's my one final point about touch.\n\n436\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:19.577\nAnd if I touch, let's just say something,\nnotice, no file extension.\n\n437\n00:23:19.577 --> 00:23:21.370\nLook, it doesn't complain.\n\n438\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.090\nAnd if I open this up, and\nI'm gonna open something.\n\n439\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.500\nNotice this says txt right here.\n\n440\n00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.950\nThis is png, this is a .docx,\nand this is pdf.\n\n441\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.610\nThere's nothing here.\n&gt;&gt; That something has nothing [LAUGH].\n\n442\n00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.790\n&gt;&gt; That something has nothing,\n\n443\n00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.620\nhow appropriate.\n\n444\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.220\nBut let's try to open it up,\nand guess what?\n\n445\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.970\nIt still opens in text edit.\n\n446\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.170\nBy default, kinda the assumption is,\n\n447\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.700\nif you don't have a file extension,\nit is plain text.\n\n448\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.830\nThere is no encoding,\nthere's no rich text formatting, nothing.\n\n449\n00:23:53.842 --> 00:23:58.010\nIt'll work, and I actually use these for\nconfigurations and things of that nature\n\n450\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.100\nwhere I'm like, I don't really want it to\nbe associated with a particular program.\n\n451\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:09.496\nSo I'm just gonna leave the extension on.\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like a sticky note.\n\n452\n00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:11.473\nAnd again, we're in DevPro, so\n\n453\n00:24:11.473 --> 00:24:14.940\nI know that you're not going\nto be making InDesign files.\n\n454\n00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.390\nYou're probably like, what's InDesign?\n\n455\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.740\nBut it's just the whole idea\nof what I'm equating it to.\n\n456\n00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.160\nBut yeah, you're gonna just\nbe typing out text and code.\n\n457\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.560\nAnd so you don't really need to go past,\nlike you're saying, the txt or\n\n458\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.590\nthis something nothing file [LAUGH] to\nmake your different coding notes and\n\n459\n00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.350\neverything.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you'll see this come up\n\n460\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:40.540\nwhen I'm setting up a project structure,\nlike a project in your wonderful path.\n\n461\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.710\nHopefully it's wonderful.\n\n462\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.230\nWe'll use this to our advantage.\n\n463\n00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.550\nSo we can make directories,\nwe can make nested directories.\n\n464\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.920\nWe can make files using touch.\n\n465\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.944\nDo remind yourself, touch on an existing\nfile will change the last modified date.\n\n466\n00:24:54.944 --> 00:24:59.670\nBut as far as making files and folders,\nthere's a whole lot more that you can do.\n\n467\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.040\nBut again, this is about getting\nour toes wet, getting started.\n\n468\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.744\nAnd this is what we need to get\nstarted creating 1,000 folders.\n\n469\n00:25:07.744 --> 00:25:10.920\nAll right, well, my toes are feeling\npretty good right now [LAUGH].\n\n470\n00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.770\nThis is all but pretty I hate to say it\nbut it's pretty straightforward so far.\n\n471\n00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.120\nYou just have to remember the commands and\n\n472\n00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.440\nthen just making sure\nyou're in the right place.\n\n473\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.661\nI guess it's a little bit more than just\nstraightforward, but you explained it so\n\n474\n00:25:24.661 --> 00:25:27.855\nwell that I feel like I'm ready\nto go make folders like crazy.\n\n475\n00:25:27.855 -->
