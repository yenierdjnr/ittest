          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,374\n[NOISE] We get a lot of questions at\n\n2\n00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:11,119\nITProTV about how best to study for\n\n3\n00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,099\nthe Cisco exams.\n\n4\n00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,291\nIf you're working on your CCNA, CCNP,\neven your CCIE, those certifications,\n\n5\n00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,375\nthey really require hands on\nexperience with Cisco equipment.\n\n6\n00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,240\nWhat if you don't have\nthat available though?\n\n7\n00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,032\nWell there's a really neat product\nout there that can help with that and\n\n8\n00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,178\nit's called GNS3.\n\n9\n00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,980\nOne of the nice thing about\nGNS3 is it is completely free.\n\n10\n00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,920\nIt doesn't cost you any money,\nso why not use it?\n\n11\n00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,532\nSo this series of videos\nthat we're going to film,\n\n12\n00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,537\nthey're gonna show you what GNS3 is,\nhow it works, how to use it and be able to\n\n13\n00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:46,760\nbuild up a lab environment to study and\npractice to get ready for your exams.\n\n14\n00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,821\nIt's really neat stuff and\nit's really not that hard to get set up.\n\n15\n00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,800\nLet's start off real high level though,\nwhat is GNS3?\n\n16\n00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,420\nDeep down inside of it at its heart,\nGNS3 is really just a graphically user\n\n17\n00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,625\ninterface for\nanother product called Dynamips.\n\n18\n00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,100\nDynamips is the actual heart and\nsoul of this product.\n\n19\n00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,707\nWhat it is, is years ago, it's a long\ntime, a good eight to ten years ago,\n\n20\n00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:16,650\nsomeone sat down and they wrote\na hardware emulator for Cisco equipment.\n\n21\n00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,050\nIf you crack open your average Cisco\nrouter, you'll find that they have\n\n22\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,308\nIntel processors and RAM and standard\ncomponents like what you'd find in a PC.\n\n23\n00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,470\nGranted it's a proprietary motherboard but\n\n24\n00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,950\nthe majority of the components\nare just standard components.\n\n25\n00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,830\nSo, they wrote this emulator to\nemulate that set of hardware so\n\n26\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,180\nyou could run the actual Cisco IOS,\non this emulated platform.\n\n27\n00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,980\nWell, Dynamips did a pretty good job,\nbut it was command line only,\n\n28\n00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,850\nso it wasn't very user-friendly.\n\n29\n00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,711\nSo the GNS3 project was started to\ncreate a graphical user interface for\n\n30\n00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,313\nthe Dynamips utility.\n\n31\n00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,754\nAnd it's still Dynamips is under the hood,\nbut\n\n32\n00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:57,696\nthe graphical user interface\nkind of covers all that up.\n\n33\n00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:00,755\nAnd so a lot of people look at GNS3\nas being a full total product, and\n\n34\n00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:04,310\nit's actually made up of\nseveral different components.\n\n35\n00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,160\nBut, you don't have to worry about that.\n\n36\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,990\nWe can download and install GNS3,\nhave it up and running, and\n\n37\n00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,670\nstart emulating Cisco hardware.\n\n38\n00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,890\nNow, notice I'm saying emulate,\nnot simulate.\n\n39\n00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,340\nThere's a lot of companies out there that\ndo simulators, like the Boson NetiSm.\n\n40\n00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,770\nAnd they're perfectly good products.\n\n41\n00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,458\nBut on those, you're not actually\nworking with the Cisco IOS.\n\n42\n00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,620\nYou're usually interacting with\nsomething like a Java application.\n\n43\n00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,180\nYou type a command,\nit parses your command, and\n\n44\n00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,230\nit gives you canned output\nthat reflects what you typed.\n\n45\n00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,950\nSo when you type show version, it's not\nactually checking what IOS version you're\n\n46\n00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,000\nrunning and displaying that.\n\n47\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,680\nInstead it's got this canned\noutput that it feeds you.\n\n48\n00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,470\nThe problem with simulators,\n\n49\n00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,860\nthey only support the commands\nthat the developers put in there.\n\n50\n00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,270\nSo if you wanna run a command that's\noutside of the scope of the CCNA course,\n\n51\n00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,160\nfor example, it's not gonna work.\n\n52\n00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,790\nRight?\nNow I say that's the problem.\n\n53\n00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,720\nIt's not really a problem.\n\n54\n00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,460\nIf you're studying for the exam,\nthose simulators are great.\n\n55\n00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,420\nThey usually come prepackaged with labs,\nand they're a really valuable resource.\n\n56\n00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,849\nI've used the Boson NetSim myself.\n\n57\n00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,276\nI really like the product.\n\n58\n00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:08,589\nBut an emulator, with an emulator,\nyou run the actual Cisco IOS.\n\n59\n00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,910\nEvery command works.\n\n60\n00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,130\nDoesn't matter if it's on the exam or\nnot, all the commands work.\n\n61\n00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,382\nAnd it's the real IOS so\nit's not like you're running a command and\n\n62\n00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:17,533\nyou get canned output.\n\n63\n00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:21,970\nYou get output that's reflecting what's\ngoing on in that router at that time.\n\n64\n00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,723\nSo, there's the real value of an emulator.\n\n65\n00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:28,584\nYou can use GNS3 to study to get ready for\nthe exams, you can use it to mock up\n\n66\n00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:32,240\nnetworks to get ready for\nsome kind of deployment in production.\n\n67\n00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,456\nYou can do all sorts of\nreally cool things in it.\n\n68\n00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,453\nIt's a neat product, and\n\n69\n00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,640\nthe fact that it's free is\nreally just icing on the cake.\n\n70\n00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,018\nAll right,\nif you've never heard of it before,\n\n71\n00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,824\nthe website is really easy to get to.\n\n72\n00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:47,524\nIt's GNS3.net, and so\nthat's where I'm at right now is GNS3.net.\n\n73\n00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,365\nTheir web page is fairly Spartan.\n\n74\n00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,087\nNot a whole lot of stuff on here, and\n\n75\n00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:54,010\nit really centers around\ngetting you that software.\n\n76\n00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,223\nThey give a description here and\nthey tell you it's an intuitive\n\n77\n00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,628\ngraphical user interface and\nit runs on top of multiple emulators.\n\n78\n00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,200\nDynamips is the main one.\n\n79\n00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,360\nThat's the Cisco IOS emulator.\n\n80\n00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,292\nBut it does more.\n\n81\n00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,759\nYou'll see there's a VirtualBox and\na QEMU emulator too.\n\n82\n00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,176\nWhy do we need those?\n\n83\n00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:15,339\nWell, you'll see that it adds Cisco ASA\nand Pix support, so if you want to\n\n84\n00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,930\ndo Cisco firewalls, it also allows\nyou to do things like Juniper, Junos.\n\n85\n00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,582\nIf you wanna learn Juniper routers,\nyou can bring those up.\n\n86\n00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:26,029\nBut they run on different types of\nhardware than what Cisco routers do, so\n\n87\n00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,590\nthey don't use Dynamips.\n\n88\n00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,470\nThey use VirtualBox and QEMU to\nemulate the hardware needed for them.\n\n89\n00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,248\nIt's a little bit different.\n\n90\n00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,940\nNow you can do it all at once though.\n\n91\n00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,493\nSo you could have Cisco IOS routers\nrunning by the Cisco ASA, running right by\n\n92\n00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:43,627\na Junos router, you know you can have that\nflexibility, it's really, really cool.\n\n93\n00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:48,280\nNow, one of the main questions that you'll\nsee asked on the Internet on these various\n\n94\n00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,910\nquestions is.\n\n95\n00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,773\nIs this legal?\n\n96\n00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:56,830\nWell, you know, as like many of these\nthings there's kind of a grey area here.\n\n97\n00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,686\nThe true honest answer at the end of\nthe day is that yes, it is legal.\n\n98\n00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,800\nThe emulator itself is legal,\nthe software is legal.\n\n99\n00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,292\nWhere we start to get into\na problem is with the IOS, right.\n\n100\n00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,270\nCisco routers run the Internetwork\nOperating System, the IOS.\n\n101\n00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,525\nAnd when you buy a Cisco router.\n\n102\n00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:19,140\nYou're also buying a license to run\nthe IOS on that router hardware.\n\n103\n00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,430\nThat means, you've licensed the IOS but\n\n104\n00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,188\nyou've only licensed it\nto run on that hardware.\n\n105\n00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,742\nYou're not licensed to\nrun it somewhere else.\n\n106\n00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,547\nCisco doesn't sell just licenses for\nthe IOS.\n\n107\n00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:33,220\nThey only sell licenses for\nthe IOS tied to hardware.\n\n108\n00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,160\nSo when we fire up something like GNS3\nit's gonna need the operating system,\n\n109\n00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,390\nit's gonna need the IOS.\n\n110\n00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,300\nThey don't give us that cuz\nthey're not allowed to.\n\n111\n00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,980\nThat would be illegal.\n\n112\n00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,660\nBut if you have a copy of the IOS\nfrom your own production routers,\n\n113\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,770\nyou can throw it on here and\nit'll run just fine.\n\n114\n00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,930\nBut technically you're\nviolating your license,\n\n115\n00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,551\ncuz your license said you were\nlicensed to run that software.\n\n116\n00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:58,032\nOn top of the Cisco hardware, not on\ntop of GNS3 or Dynamips or whatever,\n\n117\n00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,270\nall right.\n\n118\n00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,039\nSo is it legal?\n\n119\n00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,419\nWell the software is.\n\n120\n00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,838\nUsing it though requires you to pull\na Cisco license the wrong way which is\n\n121\n00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,420\ntechnically not legal, right.\n\n122\n00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,979\nYou're violating the terms\nof service from Cisco.\n\n123\n00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,160\nThat being said,\neven Cisco uses GNS3 internally.\n\n124\n00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,846\nSo it's a very common, popular program.\n\n125\n00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:22,298\nThere's a lot of companies out there that\ndo Cisco training and they use GNS3.\n\n126\n00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,001\nSo, it's something that's\ndefinitely known by Cisco and\n\n127\n00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,120\nthey've chosen not to\nenforce that license.\n\n128\n00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,349\nNow, one day they may change their mind,\nbut as of right now,\n\n129\n00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,417\nthey haven't enforced that license.\n\n130\n00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,842\nAnd so many, many people,\nincluding myself make use of the product.\n\n131\n00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,315\nSo it is a really neat one.\n\n132\n00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,492\nWell if you want to see just kind of\na quick guided tour of it before we get it\n\n133\n00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:46,970\ninstalled, they've got some nice\nscreenshots here on the website.\n\n134\n00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,747\nAnd what it does is it gives you\nthis graphical user interface,\n\n135\n00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:52,042\nthis guy right here.\n\n136\n00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,854\nThe way it works is basically you have\nall of these routers, firewalls, Juniper\n\n137\n00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:00,540\nrouters, all of these things over her on\nthe left; this is your network equipment.\n\n138\n00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,570\nYou just drag and drop it out here and\nyou link it together.\n\n139\n00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,350\nYou can link it together with\nethernet cables or serial cables,\n\n140\n00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,780\nthat's what these red\nlightning bolts are here.\n\n141\n00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,965\nThese are serial cables.\n\n142\n00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:15,830\nThey're doing simulated T1 lines or\nISDN, or something like that.\n\n143\n00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,830\nYou can emulate technology that would be\nincredibly expensive to set up in your own\n\n144\n00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,570\nlab, and you can bring out\nas many routers as you want.\n\n145\n00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,435\nSo instead of having to go to eBay and buy\na bunch of physical used routers that may\n\n146\n00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:30,339\nor may not work right, here,\nyou just bring them right up.\n\n147\n00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,516\nAnd you'll see the routers that they\nsupport, the 1700s, those are pretty\n\n148\n00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:38,600\nlow-end, pretty old routers, but\nthey go up all the way to the 7200s.\n\n149\n00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,438\nAnd the Cisco 7200, that's a beefy\nrouter that can perform every\n\n150\n00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,298\nsingle activity from the CCNA,\nCCNP, and CCIE exams.\n\n151\n00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:50,435\nIt's a really,\nreally powerful router framework, so\n\n152\n00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,020\nyou really get that full feature set.\n\n153\n00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,008\nAnd they don't show it\nhere in this screen shot,\n\n154\n00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,668\nlet me see if they have one that shows it.\n\n155\n00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,640\nWhen you add a router in, you can pull\nup the properties of that router and\n\n156\n00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,660\nstart to manipulate its settings.\n\n157\n00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,473\nAnd, yeah they don't really show it here.\n\n158\n00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:07,571\nBut you can manipulate the settings\nas far as inserting different WICs,\n\n159\n00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,700\nthe WAN interface cards.\n\n160\n00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,102\nYou can choose which cards you want in it,\n\n161\n00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:14,409\nto make that router unique for\nthat particular purpose.\n\n162\n00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,790\nYou know like these routers here.\n\n163\n00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,758\nCisco routers don't typically come\nwith serial ports by default.\n\n164\n00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,019\nSo somebody's added cards into these\nrouters to be able to have that\n\n165\n00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,450\nconnectivity.\n\n166\n00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,446\nYou get link lights and\n\n167\n00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:28,395\ninformation as far as whether\nthe connections are up and working.\n\n168\n00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,530\nAnd you can start and stop the routers.\n\n169\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,363\nYou can back up their configurations and\nbuild some really cool labs.\n\n170\n00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,880\nThey even have some labs available for\ndownload on their site.\n\n171\n00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,010\nIf you look up here,\nwe've got this labs tab and\n\n172\n00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,336\nyou'll see here some, it looks like\nthey just have the Juniper ones now.\n\n173\n00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,760\nBut they're working on Cisco ones.\n\n174\n00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,028\nI know those are coming out soon.\n\n175\n00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:48,960\nBut, actually that's what\nthey're saying right here.\n\n176\n00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,245\nLabs will come very soon for Cisco.\n\n177\n00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,750\nBut basically it's a very\nvaluable resource, and\n\n178\n00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,370\nit's a great alternative to going out and\nbuying the physical hardware.\n\n179\n00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,292\nNow, can you buy the physical hardware?\n\n180\n00:08:59,292 --> 00:08:59,906\nAbsolutely.\n\n181\n00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,277\nThat's what I did when I got started.\n\n182\n00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:02,840\nI went out and ordered eight routers.\n\n183\n00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,755\nIt cost me a ton of money,\nand they were super loud and\n\n184\n00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,021\nate up a lot of electricity at the house.\n\n185\n00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:10,130\nBut that's how I learned,\nover ten years ago.\n\n186\n00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,660\nRight.\n\n187\n00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,093\nBecause we didn't have things like this.\n\n188\n00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,400\nIf I had to do it again today, I never\nwould've bought all that equipment, right.\n\n189\n00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,443\nIt was a lot of money\nkinda down the drain.\n\n190\n00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:21,293\nVersus this, where I could whip up\nwhatever environment I wanted and when I\n\n191\n00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:25,344\nwas done I could just shut it down and\nit's not consuming extra power and so on.\n\n192\n00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:29,204\nThe other thing is it's really efficient,\nwe'll see this a little bit later, how it\n\n193\n00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:32,890\nmanages CPU and how it manages memory,\nit does a really good job on those things.\n\n194\n00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,449\nSo GS3, very powerful software package,\ndoes a lot of great things.\n\n195\n00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,925\nWonderful for your studies.\n\n196\n00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:43,452\nAll right,\nthat's enough of an introduction for GNS3.\n\n197\n00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,746\nNow we're going to move into our next set\nof videos, where we'll start to show how\n\n198\n00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,916\nto get it installed and\nhow to actually make use of it.\n\n199\n00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,354\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n200\n00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,375\nWe'll be back with more.\n\n201\n00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:58,049\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
