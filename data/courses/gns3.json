          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,374\n[NOISE] We get a lot of questions at\n\n2\n00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:11,119\nITProTV about how best to study for\n\n3\n00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,099\nthe Cisco exams.\n\n4\n00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,291\nIf you're working on your CCNA, CCNP,\neven your CCIE, those certifications,\n\n5\n00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,375\nthey really require hands on\nexperience with Cisco equipment.\n\n6\n00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,240\nWhat if you don't have\nthat available though?\n\n7\n00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,032\nWell there's a really neat product\nout there that can help with that and\n\n8\n00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,178\nit's called GNS3.\n\n9\n00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,980\nOne of the nice thing about\nGNS3 is it is completely free.\n\n10\n00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,920\nIt doesn't cost you any money,\nso why not use it?\n\n11\n00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,532\nSo this series of videos\nthat we're going to film,\n\n12\n00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,537\nthey're gonna show you what GNS3 is,\nhow it works, how to use it and be able to\n\n13\n00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:46,760\nbuild up a lab environment to study and\npractice to get ready for your exams.\n\n14\n00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,821\nIt's really neat stuff and\nit's really not that hard to get set up.\n\n15\n00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,800\nLet's start off real high level though,\nwhat is GNS3?\n\n16\n00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,420\nDeep down inside of it at its heart,\nGNS3 is really just a graphically user\n\n17\n00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,625\ninterface for\nanother product called Dynamips.\n\n18\n00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,100\nDynamips is the actual heart and\nsoul of this product.\n\n19\n00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,707\nWhat it is, is years ago, it's a long\ntime, a good eight to ten years ago,\n\n20\n00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:16,650\nsomeone sat down and they wrote\na hardware emulator for Cisco equipment.\n\n21\n00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,050\nIf you crack open your average Cisco\nrouter, you'll find that they have\n\n22\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,308\nIntel processors and RAM and standard\ncomponents like what you'd find in a PC.\n\n23\n00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,470\nGranted it's a proprietary motherboard but\n\n24\n00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,950\nthe majority of the components\nare just standard components.\n\n25\n00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,830\nSo, they wrote this emulator to\nemulate that set of hardware so\n\n26\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,180\nyou could run the actual Cisco IOS,\non this emulated platform.\n\n27\n00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,980\nWell, Dynamips did a pretty good job,\nbut it was command line only,\n\n28\n00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,850\nso it wasn't very user-friendly.\n\n29\n00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,711\nSo the GNS3 project was started to\ncreate a graphical user interface for\n\n30\n00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,313\nthe Dynamips utility.\n\n31\n00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,754\nAnd it's still Dynamips is under the hood,\nbut\n\n32\n00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:57,696\nthe graphical user interface\nkind of covers all that up.\n\n33\n00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:00,755\nAnd so a lot of people look at GNS3\nas being a full total product, and\n\n34\n00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:04,310\nit's actually made up of\nseveral different components.\n\n35\n00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,160\nBut, you don't have to worry about that.\n\n36\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,990\nWe can download and install GNS3,\nhave it up and running, and\n\n37\n00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,670\nstart emulating Cisco hardware.\n\n38\n00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,890\nNow, notice I'm saying emulate,\nnot simulate.\n\n39\n00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,340\nThere's a lot of companies out there that\ndo simulators, like the Boson NetiSm.\n\n40\n00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,770\nAnd they're perfectly good products.\n\n41\n00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,458\nBut on those, you're not actually\nworking with the Cisco IOS.\n\n42\n00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,620\nYou're usually interacting with\nsomething like a Java application.\n\n43\n00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,180\nYou type a command,\nit parses your command, and\n\n44\n00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,230\nit gives you canned output\nthat reflects what you typed.\n\n45\n00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,950\nSo when you type show version, it's not\nactually checking what IOS version you're\n\n46\n00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,000\nrunning and displaying that.\n\n47\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,680\nInstead it's got this canned\noutput that it feeds you.\n\n48\n00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,470\nThe problem with simulators,\n\n49\n00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,860\nthey only support the commands\nthat the developers put in there.\n\n50\n00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,270\nSo if you wanna run a command that's\noutside of the scope of the CCNA course,\n\n51\n00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,160\nfor example, it's not gonna work.\n\n52\n00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,790\nRight?\nNow I say that's the problem.\n\n53\n00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,720\nIt's not really a problem.\n\n54\n00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,460\nIf you're studying for the exam,\nthose simulators are great.\n\n55\n00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,420\nThey usually come prepackaged with labs,\nand they're a really valuable resource.\n\n56\n00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,849\nI've used the Boson NetSim myself.\n\n57\n00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,276\nI really like the product.\n\n58\n00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:08,589\nBut an emulator, with an emulator,\nyou run the actual Cisco IOS.\n\n59\n00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,910\nEvery command works.\n\n60\n00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,130\nDoesn't matter if it's on the exam or\nnot, all the commands work.\n\n61\n00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,382\nAnd it's the real IOS so\nit's not like you're running a command and\n\n62\n00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:17,533\nyou get canned output.\n\n63\n00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:21,970\nYou get output that's reflecting what's\ngoing on in that router at that time.\n\n64\n00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,723\nSo, there's the real value of an emulator.\n\n65\n00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:28,584\nYou can use GNS3 to study to get ready for\nthe exams, you can use it to mock up\n\n66\n00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:32,240\nnetworks to get ready for\nsome kind of deployment in production.\n\n67\n00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,456\nYou can do all sorts of\nreally cool things in it.\n\n68\n00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,453\nIt's a neat product, and\n\n69\n00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,640\nthe fact that it's free is\nreally just icing on the cake.\n\n70\n00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,018\nAll right,\nif you've never heard of it before,\n\n71\n00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,824\nthe website is really easy to get to.\n\n72\n00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:47,524\nIt's GNS3.net, and so\nthat's where I'm at right now is GNS3.net.\n\n73\n00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,365\nTheir web page is fairly Spartan.\n\n74\n00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,087\nNot a whole lot of stuff on here, and\n\n75\n00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:54,010\nit really centers around\ngetting you that software.\n\n76\n00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,223\nThey give a description here and\nthey tell you it's an intuitive\n\n77\n00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,628\ngraphical user interface and\nit runs on top of multiple emulators.\n\n78\n00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,200\nDynamips is the main one.\n\n79\n00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,360\nThat's the Cisco IOS emulator.\n\n80\n00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,292\nBut it does more.\n\n81\n00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,759\nYou'll see there's a VirtualBox and\na QEMU emulator too.\n\n82\n00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,176\nWhy do we need those?\n\n83\n00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:15,339\nWell, you'll see that it adds Cisco ASA\nand Pix support, so if you want to\n\n84\n00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,930\ndo Cisco firewalls, it also allows\nyou to do things like Juniper, Junos.\n\n85\n00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,582\nIf you wanna learn Juniper routers,\nyou can bring those up.\n\n86\n00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:26,029\nBut they run on different types of\nhardware than what Cisco routers do, so\n\n87\n00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,590\nthey don't use Dynamips.\n\n88\n00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,470\nThey use VirtualBox and QEMU to\nemulate the hardware needed for them.\n\n89\n00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,248\nIt's a little bit different.\n\n90\n00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,940\nNow you can do it all at once though.\n\n91\n00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,493\nSo you could have Cisco IOS routers\nrunning by the Cisco ASA, running right by\n\n92\n00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:43,627\na Junos router, you know you can have that\nflexibility, it's really, really cool.\n\n93\n00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:48,280\nNow, one of the main questions that you'll\nsee asked on the Internet on these various\n\n94\n00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,910\nquestions is.\n\n95\n00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,773\nIs this legal?\n\n96\n00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:56,830\nWell, you know, as like many of these\nthings there's kind of a grey area here.\n\n97\n00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,686\nThe true honest answer at the end of\nthe day is that yes, it is legal.\n\n98\n00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,800\nThe emulator itself is legal,\nthe software is legal.\n\n99\n00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,292\nWhere we start to get into\na problem is with the IOS, right.\n\n100\n00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,270\nCisco routers run the Internetwork\nOperating System, the IOS.\n\n101\n00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,525\nAnd when you buy a Cisco router.\n\n102\n00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:19,140\nYou're also buying a license to run\nthe IOS on that router hardware.\n\n103\n00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,430\nThat means, you've licensed the IOS but\n\n104\n00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,188\nyou've only licensed it\nto run on that hardware.\n\n105\n00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,742\nYou're not licensed to\nrun it somewhere else.\n\n106\n00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,547\nCisco doesn't sell just licenses for\nthe IOS.\n\n107\n00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:33,220\nThey only sell licenses for\nthe IOS tied to hardware.\n\n108\n00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,160\nSo when we fire up something like GNS3\nit's gonna need the operating system,\n\n109\n00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,390\nit's gonna need the IOS.\n\n110\n00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,300\nThey don't give us that cuz\nthey're not allowed to.\n\n111\n00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,980\nThat would be illegal.\n\n112\n00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,660\nBut if you have a copy of the IOS\nfrom your own production routers,\n\n113\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,770\nyou can throw it on here and\nit'll run just fine.\n\n114\n00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,930\nBut technically you're\nviolating your license,\n\n115\n00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,551\ncuz your license said you were\nlicensed to run that software.\n\n116\n00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:58,032\nOn top of the Cisco hardware, not on\ntop of GNS3 or Dynamips or whatever,\n\n117\n00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,270\nall right.\n\n118\n00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,039\nSo is it legal?\n\n119\n00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,419\nWell the software is.\n\n120\n00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,838\nUsing it though requires you to pull\na Cisco license the wrong way which is\n\n121\n00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,420\ntechnically not legal, right.\n\n122\n00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,979\nYou're violating the terms\nof service from Cisco.\n\n123\n00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,160\nThat being said,\neven Cisco uses GNS3 internally.\n\n124\n00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,846\nSo it's a very common, popular program.\n\n125\n00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:22,298\nThere's a lot of companies out there that\ndo Cisco training and they use GNS3.\n\n126\n00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,001\nSo, it's something that's\ndefinitely known by Cisco and\n\n127\n00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,120\nthey've chosen not to\nenforce that license.\n\n128\n00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,349\nNow, one day they may change their mind,\nbut as of right now,\n\n129\n00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,417\nthey haven't enforced that license.\n\n130\n00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,842\nAnd so many, many people,\nincluding myself make use of the product.\n\n131\n00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,315\nSo it is a really neat one.\n\n132\n00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,492\nWell if you want to see just kind of\na quick guided tour of it before we get it\n\n133\n00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:46,970\ninstalled, they've got some nice\nscreenshots here on the website.\n\n134\n00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,747\nAnd what it does is it gives you\nthis graphical user interface,\n\n135\n00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:52,042\nthis guy right here.\n\n136\n00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,854\nThe way it works is basically you have\nall of these routers, firewalls, Juniper\n\n137\n00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:00,540\nrouters, all of these things over her on\nthe left; this is your network equipment.\n\n138\n00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,570\nYou just drag and drop it out here and\nyou link it together.\n\n139\n00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,350\nYou can link it together with\nethernet cables or serial cables,\n\n140\n00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,780\nthat's what these red\nlightning bolts are here.\n\n141\n00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,965\nThese are serial cables.\n\n142\n00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:15,830\nThey're doing simulated T1 lines or\nISDN, or something like that.\n\n143\n00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,830\nYou can emulate technology that would be\nincredibly expensive to set up in your own\n\n144\n00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,570\nlab, and you can bring out\nas many routers as you want.\n\n145\n00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,435\nSo instead of having to go to eBay and buy\na bunch of physical used routers that may\n\n146\n00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:30,339\nor may not work right, here,\nyou just bring them right up.\n\n147\n00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,516\nAnd you'll see the routers that they\nsupport, the 1700s, those are pretty\n\n148\n00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:38,600\nlow-end, pretty old routers, but\nthey go up all the way to the 7200s.\n\n149\n00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,438\nAnd the Cisco 7200, that's a beefy\nrouter that can perform every\n\n150\n00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,298\nsingle activity from the CCNA,\nCCNP, and CCIE exams.\n\n151\n00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:50,435\nIt's a really,\nreally powerful router framework, so\n\n152\n00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,020\nyou really get that full feature set.\n\n153\n00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,008\nAnd they don't show it\nhere in this screen shot,\n\n154\n00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,668\nlet me see if they have one that shows it.\n\n155\n00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,640\nWhen you add a router in, you can pull\nup the properties of that router and\n\n156\n00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,660\nstart to manipulate its settings.\n\n157\n00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,473\nAnd, yeah they don't really show it here.\n\n158\n00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:07,571\nBut you can manipulate the settings\nas far as inserting different WICs,\n\n159\n00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,700\nthe WAN interface cards.\n\n160\n00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,102\nYou can choose which cards you want in it,\n\n161\n00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:14,409\nto make that router unique for\nthat particular purpose.\n\n162\n00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,790\nYou know like these routers here.\n\n163\n00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,758\nCisco routers don't typically come\nwith serial ports by default.\n\n164\n00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,019\nSo somebody's added cards into these\nrouters to be able to have that\n\n165\n00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,450\nconnectivity.\n\n166\n00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,446\nYou get link lights and\n\n167\n00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:28,395\ninformation as far as whether\nthe connections are up and working.\n\n168\n00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,530\nAnd you can start and stop the routers.\n\n169\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,363\nYou can back up their configurations and\nbuild some really cool labs.\n\n170\n00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,880\nThey even have some labs available for\ndownload on their site.\n\n171\n00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,010\nIf you look up here,\nwe've got this labs tab and\n\n172\n00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,336\nyou'll see here some, it looks like\nthey just have the Juniper ones now.\n\n173\n00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,760\nBut they're working on Cisco ones.\n\n174\n00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,028\nI know those are coming out soon.\n\n175\n00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:48,960\nBut, actually that's what\nthey're saying right here.\n\n176\n00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,245\nLabs will come very soon for Cisco.\n\n177\n00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,750\nBut basically it's a very\nvaluable resource, and\n\n178\n00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,370\nit's a great alternative to going out and\nbuying the physical hardware.\n\n179\n00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,292\nNow, can you buy the physical hardware?\n\n180\n00:08:59,292 --> 00:08:59,906\nAbsolutely.\n\n181\n00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,277\nThat's what I did when I got started.\n\n182\n00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:02,840\nI went out and ordered eight routers.\n\n183\n00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,755\nIt cost me a ton of money,\nand they were super loud and\n\n184\n00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,021\nate up a lot of electricity at the house.\n\n185\n00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:10,130\nBut that's how I learned,\nover ten years ago.\n\n186\n00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,660\nRight.\n\n187\n00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,093\nBecause we didn't have things like this.\n\n188\n00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,400\nIf I had to do it again today, I never\nwould've bought all that equipment, right.\n\n189\n00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,443\nIt was a lot of money\nkinda down the drain.\n\n190\n00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:21,293\nVersus this, where I could whip up\nwhatever environment I wanted and when I\n\n191\n00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:25,344\nwas done I could just shut it down and\nit's not consuming extra power and so on.\n\n192\n00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:29,204\nThe other thing is it's really efficient,\nwe'll see this a little bit later, how it\n\n193\n00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:32,890\nmanages CPU and how it manages memory,\nit does a really good job on those things.\n\n194\n00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,449\nSo GS3, very powerful software package,\ndoes a lot of great things.\n\n195\n00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,925\nWonderful for your studies.\n\n196\n00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:43,452\nAll right,\nthat's enough of an introduction for GNS3.\n\n197\n00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,746\nNow we're going to move into our next set\nof videos, where we'll start to show how\n\n198\n00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,916\nto get it installed and\nhow to actually make use of it.\n\n199\n00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,354\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n200\n00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,375\nWe'll be back with more.\n\n201\n00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:58,049\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,713\n[SOUND]\nSo\n\n2\n00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:12,390\nnow we’re ready to get GNS3 installed,\nand it’s really pretty easy.\n\n3\n00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,480\nWhen you install GNS3,\nthe first part is we need to go in and\n\n4\n00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,210\ndownload our binaries, right,\ndownload the software to get it installed.\n\n5\n00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,030\nAnd GNS3 is available for\nmore than one operating system.\n\n6\n00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,970\nSo you’ll see a couple\nof different choices.\n\n7\n00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,790\nIf you're running OS X, that's fine.\n\n8\n00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,300\nThey support it.\n\n9\n00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,590\nIf you're running Windows, it's there.\n\n10\n00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,140\nIf you're running Linux, it's there.\n\n11\n00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,670\nIt's all developed using Python and Qt and\n\n12\n00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,590\nthat means it is really platform agnostic,\nit's really, really quite neat.\n\n13\n00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,580\nIf you wanna download it, jump over to\nthe gns3.net page, and let me warn you.\n\n14\n00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,950\nThey do display a lot of\nadvertisements on the page.\n\n15\n00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,160\nRemember, this is free software.\n\n16\n00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,820\nThey gotta make money somehow.\n\n17\n00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,460\nBut, there's been more than once when I\nhave come to there page and the ad said,\n\n18\n00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,100\nyou know like it had a big\ndownload button, and\n\n19\n00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,480\nit looked like that was the way to go and\nin reality that was just an advertisement.\n\n20\n00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,200\nSo you do want to be careful with that.\n\n21\n00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,770\nDon't just jump in and\nhit Download on the first button you see.\n\n22\n00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,250\nRight up here in their menu bar though,\nyou'll see a link that says, Download.\n\n23\n00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,540\nAnd we can go and hit that and\n\n24\n00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,840\nit'll take us to the various\ndownload links that we've got.\n\n25\n00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,170\nAnd you need to pick the one for\nyour operating system.\n\n26\n00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,870\nYou'll see Windows,\n\n27\n00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,750\nMac, OS X, Linux and just the generic\nsource code down there at the bottom.\n\n28\n00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,900\nSo, we picked the one that we want.\n\n29\n00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,430\nFor windows we are normally gonna\nuse this GNS3 all in one, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,050\nBut for 32 and 64 bit system you can\npick and choose if you want, but\n\n31\n00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,520\nif you get the all in one, its actually\ngot both in the same package and\n\n32\n00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,206\nit will choose the appropriate one for\nyour system.\n\n33\n00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:40,810\nFor Mac OS X, you'll see that they've\ngot their current version and\n\n34\n00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,690\ntheir older Snow Leopard version.\n\n35\n00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,680\nOn the Linux side they've got packages for\nDebian and Ubuntu.\n\n36\n00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,400\nThey don't have like Red Hat packages,\nbut you can bring those in.\n\n37\n00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,810\nThere's a few different\nways to go about that.\n\n38\n00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,550\nAll right.\n\n39\n00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,550\nSo, these are the different\npackages that are available.\n\n40\n00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,520\nWe just download it and get it installed.\n\n41\n00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,160\nNow, notice it's packaged\nwith a lot of other things.\n\n42\n00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,600\nIt says it includes dynamips,\nQEMU, and PEMU.\n\n43\n00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,150\nI've mentioned each of those,\nit also includes PuTTY.\n\n44\n00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,840\nNow, PuTTY is a Telnet,\nSSH and serial port client.\n\n45\n00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,655\nI use it in a lot of our shows.\n\n46\n00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,960\nYou'll see, I've already got it\ninstalled on my machine, right here.\n\n47\n00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,850\nSo, it's my go to SSH client.\n\n48\n00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,125\nAnd, in a really handy way,\nto be able to quickly connect to systems.\n\n49\n00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,130\nGNS3 has it packaged in, so\n\n50\n00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,110\nthat you can connect to the routers\nthat are in your system.\n\n51\n00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,950\nYou'll see VPCS and Win Pcap.\n\n52\n00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,870\nEach of these are providing different\nfunctionality in the system.\n\n53\n00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,780\nWin Pcap is one of the most important.\n\n54\n00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,300\nNow Win Pcap is part of the Windows\ninstaller, not Mac OS X, and not Linux.\n\n55\n00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:51,000\nWhat WinPcap is a packet capture driver\nsorry, packet capture driver I can say it.\n\n56\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,080\nIn Windows, software is not allowed\nto just grab a network card and\n\n57\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,710\nflip it into what's called promiscuous\nmode where it just starts gathering all\n\n58\n00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,840\nthe data that it sees.\n\n59\n00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,370\nWindows doesn't allow that.\n\n60\n00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,830\nWINPcap enables that,\nit enables the ability for\n\n61\n00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,550\nall our software to just gather all\nthe data off of a network card.\n\n62\n00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,770\nInside of GNS3, if we want to be able to\nmonitor the traffic on these routers,\n\n63\n00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,260\nwe need that functionality.\n\n64\n00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,450\nNow you may already have\nWINPcap on your system,\n\n65\n00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,150\nother software like\nWireshark installs it too.\n\n66\n00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,710\nSo, you very well may already have it.\n\n67\n00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,660\nBut if you don't, it is packaged in there.\n\n68\n00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,890\nAnd you'll even see here,\nWireshark is packaged in.\n\n69\n00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,470\nWhy is that?\n\n70\n00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,570\nWell, you might have\nnoticed in the screenshots,\n\n71\n00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,050\nthey give us the ability to right\nclick on a link, right here.\n\n72\n00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,580\nWhen you're inside of GNS3, you can\nright click on a link anywhere you want.\n\n73\n00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,110\nAnd choose Capture Network and\nit will launch Wireshark and\n\n74\n00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,330\nit'll show you the actual packets\nthat are crossing that line so\n\n75\n00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,040\nyou can see the traffic in real time.\n\n76\n00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,810\nIt's really neat, so\nthey package Wireshark with it.\n\n77\n00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,830\nNow if you already have WinPcap installed\nor if you already have Wireshark,\n\n78\n00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,830\nit's not gonna double them up on you,\nright, but if you're missing them it will\n\n79\n00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,900\nput them on there, so that's kind\nof a neat I think that it does.\n\n80\n00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,820\nAll right, so\nlet's get this turkey installed.\n\n81\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,800\nWhen we download it,\nit's just a straight forward installer,\n\n82\n00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,390\nnothing too special there.\n\n83\n00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,670\nLooks like it's asking me to sign up for\nupdates.\n\n84\n00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,220\nNotice this tiny little link down here,\nno thanks,\n\n85\n00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,995\nplease take me to the download,\nthat's what I want.\n\n86\n00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,120\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm going to go and download it and\n\n87\n00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,090\nthis download is coming from SourceForge.\n\n88\n00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,730\nSourceForge you can\ntrust most of the time.\n\n89\n00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,650\nSometimes SourceForge does weird stuff.\n\n90\n00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,160\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and download this.\n\n91\n00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,080\nI'll just store it right on my desktop and\nwe'll download that.\n\n92\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,320\nIt's about 40MB in size.\n\n93\n00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,350\nNot very big.\n\n94\n00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,630\nWe'll see it gets bigger as we\nstart to throw all of our different\n\n95\n00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,750\nsoftware in there.\n\n96\n00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750\nSo we'll get that download.\n\n97\n00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,740\nNow during the installer,\n\n98\n00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,160\nfor the most part we're just gonna\nbe clicking Next a bunch of times.\n\n99\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400\nBut when it gets to installing WinPcap,\nit's gonna reset my network adapter.\n\n100\n00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,930\nNow I'm sharing my screen with\nyou guys via our network here so\n\n101\n00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,400\nwhen my network adapter resets,\nmy screen will probably freeze.\n\n102\n00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,850\nSo just expect that.\n\n103\n00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,700\nIn real life land, if you're\ninstalling this in the background, and\n\n104\n00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,860\nyou're doing work on your computer,\nyour work might get interrupted.\n\n105\n00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,329\nSo before installing GNS3,\n\n106\n00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,450\nmake sure you finished anything\nyou were doing on the network.\n\n107\n00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,250\nJust anticipate those\nnetwork adapters to reset.\n\n108\n00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,970\nSame thing with Linux and Mac OS X,\n\n109\n00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,770\non those guys you don't\nhave to install Win PCap.\n\n110\n00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,280\nThey already have the packet drivers.\n\n111\n00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,620\nThey use Lid PCap or something like that.\n\n112\n00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,760\nAnd so they've already got that\nfunctionality but it'll still reset your\n\n113\n00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,750\nadapters when it gets set up so\nyou'll see that little interruption.\n\n114\n00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,900\nAll right, so mine finished downloading,\nI can see it right here on my desktop, and\n\n115\n00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,020\nI'm just gonna run through that installer,\nall right.\n\n116\n00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,770\nFor the most part we're\nclicking Next a bunch,\n\n117\n00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,840\nyou're just picking\na directory to install.\n\n118\n00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,540\nBut WinPcap is gonna install\nas a separate installer,\n\n119\n00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,740\nso at one point it's gonna lauch\nanother installation window for me.\n\n120\n00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,260\nSo I'll just start moving through this.\n\n121\n00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,880\nSo I'm gonna agree to my little license\nagreements and I'll pick the Start Menu\n\n122\n00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,190\nfolder, and here we see all the different\ncomponents it's gonna install.\n\n123\n00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,920\nNow, if I know that I'm not gonna be using\nsome of these things, I can go in and\n\n124\n00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,670\nuncheck them.\n\n125\n00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,260\nIf I know I'm not gonna use QEMU and PEMU,\nI'm just not gonna do Juniper or whatever.\n\n126\n00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,880\nI might choose to uncheck those so I don't\nhave them, and it gives you a little\n\n127\n00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,800\ndescription of each one, like VPCS, that's\na virtual PC simulator, it's useful for\n\n128\n00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,050\nhaving nodes,\nlike computers to test pinging from.\n\n129\n00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,420\nIt runs, I think it actually runs OpenDos,\n\n130\n00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,135\njust a very simple install to let\nyou test network connectivity, but\n\n131\n00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:26,608\nyou'll see the other things in here,\nGNS3 being the main one.\n\n132\n00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:30,332\nNotice how Super PuTTY is listed and\nit's unchecked, and\n\n133\n00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:34,650\nthat's because it saw that I\nalready have PuTTY on my system.\n\n134\n00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,670\nI might want to choose to install that\none anyway, I can check it off and\n\n135\n00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,220\nthen we would have that too,\nso I'll do it.\n\n136\n00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,800\nAll right, it's gonna install in SQL and\n/Program Files/GNS3.\n\n137\n00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,460\nI'm on a 64-bit version of Windows.\n\n138\n00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,083\nSo if it was installing the 32 bit\nversion, it would've pointed to SQL and\n\n139\n00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,540\n/Program Files x86.\n\n140\n00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,760\nSo I know that it properly chose\nthe 64 bit version for me.\n\n141\n00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,250\nAnd I’ll hit Install.\n\n142\n00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,890\nHere’s where it launches\na second installer.\n\n143\n00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,410\nSo, my GNS3 installer is still sitting\nback here, but here’s WinPcap now.\n\n144\n00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,740\nSo I’ve gotta get it installed,\nand so I’ll move forward on that.\n\n145\n00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,430\nNow, this is the part where\nwe may see this freeze.\n\n146\n00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,650\nNow, it does ask us one thing here.\n\n147\n00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,620\nIt says, do we want to automatically\nstart WinPcap at boot time.\n\n148\n00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,928\nAll right, if you're gonna use GNS3 a lot,\nusing it every day whatever, then yeah,\n\n149\n00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:25,938\nyou probably want WinPcap to\nstart when your system boots and\n\n150\n00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:28,050\njust have it always available.\n\n151\n00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,142\nBut if you're using GNS3 every now and\nthen, you might want to turn this off and\n\n152\n00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:38,082\nwhen you're going to use GNS3 you would\njust go into your services screen and\n\n153\n00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,914\nstart the WinPcap service.\n\n154\n00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:43,570\nRun GNS3, when you're done,\nyou stop the WinPcap service.\n\n155\n00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,390\nYou start and stop it when you need it.\n\n156\n00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,280\nI normally use it a lot cuz it's all\ntied to Wireshark so I'll go ahead and\n\n157\n00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,450\nlet it start at boot time.\n\n158\n00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,760\nAll right.\n\n159\n00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,070\nSo there's it's gonna install and\nit looks like,\n\n160\n00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,740\nremarkably I didn't loose my connection.\n\n161\n00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,470\nOh, I did get an error though,\nerror downloading Wireshark.\n\n162\n00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,359\nWell, that's different.\n\n163\n00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,030\nLet it try again, all right, so\nnow it's kinda turning through,\n\n164\n00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,870\nhere it's downloading the SolarWinds\nresponse time viewer, so\n\n165\n00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,390\na little free product form SolarWinds\nto be able to monitor traffic there.\n\n166\n00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,870\nSo it's just installing that,\noh they want me to register,\n\n167\n00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,010\nI'm gonna cancel that\ncuz I don't really care.\n\n168\n00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,313\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] You know, SolarWinds,\n\n169\n00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,980\nthey're a great company.\n\n170\n00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,700\nThey have a lot of great products.\n\n171\n00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,840\nBut once you're on their mailing list,\nyou're on it forever.\n\n172\n00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120\nYou'll get a ton of emails from them.\n\n173\n00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,060\nSo I usually don't register with them.\n\n174\n00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,900\nAll right, so,\nthere's my installation finishing.\n\n175\n00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,160\nI'll go ahead and move forward.\n\n176\n00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000\nIt's also asking for\n\n177\n00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,990\nthat email address again, if you\nwant to get their training material.\n\n178\n00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,325\nI'm not going to do that,\nI'll just hit Next.\n\n179\n00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,520\nAll right, and then we can finish up.\n\n180\n00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,760\nNow we did get an error when it said\nit was trying to download GNS3 so\n\n181\n00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,330\nI might get a problem here with my\nlaunch but we'll see what happens.\n\n182\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,930\nAnd there we go.\n\n183\n00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,430\nSo, it launched the web page but\nhere's GNS3 itself.\n\n184\n00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,940\nIt's installed and it's up and\nrunning, all right.\n\n185\n00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,580\nNow what we're seeing here\nis the initial Setup Wizard.\n\n186\n00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,640\nWe've gotta few more steps to go through\nbefore the system is actually useful.\n\n187\n00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,570\nBut if I just get rid of that, here it is,\nGNS3 installed and ready to rock.\n\n188\n00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,030\nNow, it looks a little different than\nthose screenshots I showed you earlier.\n\n189\n00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,440\nAnd that's because they're\nconstantly updating GNS3.\n\n190\n00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,200\nThey're not constantly\nupdating their website.\n\n191\n00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160\nSo, expect some little differences.\n\n192\n00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,360\nI've got these nice big\nicons over here now,\n\n193\n00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,170\nas opposed to the older smaller icons.\n\n194\n00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,840\nIt's just the way they've changed it to\nmake a little more room on the screen,\n\n195\n00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,280\nso just keep in mind that things might be\na little different when you get in there.\n\n196\n00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,140\nAll right, well this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop here.\n\n197\n00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,130\nGS3 is installed, stay tuned.\n\n198\n00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,260\nCuz we got more videos coming up.\n\n199\n00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,890\nWe're going to show how\nto get it configured and\n\n200\n00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,510\nactually get some routers up and running.\n\n201\n00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,636\nSo stay tuned for that,\nI'll see you in the next video.\n\n202\n00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,609\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,362\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:11,380\nSo now you've got GNS3 installed and\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n3\n00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,600\nBefore we can dive in and start firing up\nour routers though, there are some initial\n\n4\n00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,692\nconfiguration tasks we need to complete\nand then we'll be ready to move forward.\n\n5\n00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:18,620\nAll right.\n\n6\n00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,240\nThe first time you launch GNS3, you're\ngoing to get a little setup wizard that's\n\n7\n00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,940\ngoing to pop up with the three main tasks\nwe need to complete to get running.\n\n8\n00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,780\nAnd they're just kind of laid out here,\nbig, bold text.\n\n9\n00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,250\nSo, number one, configure the path to your\nOS images, iOS, Qemu, PIX, etc, directory.\n\n10\n00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,910\nThis is where you should\nstore all of your images.\n\n11\n00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,150\nSo, it's just asking,\nwhere you're gonna be storing your images?\n\n12\n00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,010\nAnd this is stuff you can change later,\n\n13\n00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,890\nit's not essential,\nit has a default folder.\n\n14\n00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,920\nBut if you click on one, what it's doing\nis it's taking you into the preferences of\n\n15\n00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,210\nGNS3 right to the page where\nyou need to find that.\n\n16\n00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,530\nSo if I click on it, it's really\njust going into the Preferences\n\n17\n00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,070\non the General tab, and\nyou'll see your OS images directory.\n\n18\n00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,450\nSo here's where you're gonna\nbe storing your images.\n\n19\n00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,350\nAnd notice it picked the folder not in\nC:/programfiles and it's doing that for\n\n20\n00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,260\npermissions reasons under Windows.\n\n21\n00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,000\nIn Unix, it'll point towards your\nhome directory, or Linux, or OSX,\n\n22\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,950\nit'll point to your home\ndirectory as well, alright.\n\n23\n00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,930\nSo that default location there,\nthat might be perfectly fine.\n\n24\n00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,950\nI'm okay with it.\n\n25\n00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,510\nSo, for me,\nit's c:/users/DonPezet/gns3/images.\n\n26\n00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,100\nSo, that's where I'm\ngonna put my iOS files.\n\n27\n00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,060\nYou can actually put them where\never the heck you want, but\n\n28\n00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,930\nit's nice to have one location.\n\n29\n00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,490\nAll right.\n\n30\n00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,920\nSo as long as you're cool with that,\nyou go ahead and leave that be and\n\n31\n00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,170\nhit the Okay button.\n\n32\n00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,310\nThe Okay button, which for\nme is actually under my task bar, so\n\n33\n00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,810\nlet me change my task bar to auto hide\nhere so I can get at my Okay button.\n\n34\n00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,160\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n35\n00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,710\nNumber two, check the path to Dynamis\nin the working directory are valid.\n\n36\n00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,680\nAll right.\n\n37\n00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,940\nWhen it installed,\nit installed a copy of Dynamips.\n\n38\n00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,860\nBut due to permissions on your hard drive,\nit might not be able to\n\n39\n00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,590\nget at those files, so\nit just wants us to do a little test.\n\n40\n00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,675\nIf you've got number two, it's gonna take\nyou right back into the Preferences, but\n\n41\n00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,475\ninstead of the general tab\nwhere we were a moment ago,\n\n42\n00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:12,235\nit now takes us to the Dynamips tab,\nalright.\n\n43\n00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,835\nAnd all you need to do is a look at\nthat path and make sure it's valid, and\n\n44\n00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,525\neven then, half the time,\n\n45\n00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:20,995\nI don't look at that because you can just\ngo right down here and hit Test Settings.\n\n46\n00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:21,625\nAll right.\nSo, there we go.\n\n47\n00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,025\nAfter you Test Settings,\nit runs through its little tests.\n\n48\n00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,315\nIt looks at the hard drive and\nmakes sure that it can access the files.\n\n49\n00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:29,440\nAnd if it works, you get this nice\nlittle green message here telling you\n\n50\n00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,090\nthat it was able to, not only find\ndynamips, but start it and get it running.\n\n51\n00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,880\nIf you get a red message here,\n\n52\n00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,570\nyou've got some kind of\na permissions issue usually, right?\n\n53\n00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,900\nBecause you just installed the file, so\n\n54\n00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,720\nit's not likely that\nthe files are missing.\n\n55\n00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,060\nThings to look for.\n\n56\n00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,560\nYou want to look for,\n\n57\n00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,870\nwell, file permissions, you might\nneed to run GNS3 as an administrator.\n\n58\n00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,570\nIf you're on a Linux or Unix machine,\n\n59\n00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,420\nyou might need to run it with\na user with higher privileges.\n\n60\n00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,540\nThe other thing is, if you've got third\nparty firewall software installed,\n\n61\n00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,010\nDynamips uses network ports to\ncommunicate, and so it may be that those\n\n62\n00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,560\nports are blocked or the software is\nnot being allowed to open the ports.\n\n63\n00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,375\nThose are all things that\ncan interrupt the service.\n\n64\n00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,245\nAnd you'll see the ports that it\nuses right here, right, TCP 7200,\n\n65\n00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:13,275\nUDP 10,001, and so on.\n\n66\n00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:16,235\nThose are the ports you'd\nwanna open up in your firewall\n\n67\n00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:18,205\nsoftware if you get a failure right here.\n\n68\n00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,065\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,205\nNow for me, I'm on Windows 8,\n\n70\n00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:24,985\nI did not run this as an administrator and\nit tested and ran just fine.\n\n71\n00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:28,015\nSo everything looks good there, alright.\n\n72\n00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,070\nSo assuming that's squared away,\nthat's test number two,\n\n73\n00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,100\nand that brings us to number three.\n\n74\n00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,730\nNumber three is add one or more\nuncompressed iOS images to the system.\n\n75\n00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,370\nThe idle PC will have\nto be configured later.\n\n76\n00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,890\nWhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n77\n00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,580\nWell, if this is the first\ntime you've installed GNS3,\n\n78\n00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,450\nmost of that's not gonna\nmake any sense to you.\n\n79\n00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,530\nSo, let's do this.\n\n80\n00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,810\nWell, we can go ahead and\nget some of it added,\n\n81\n00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,580\nbut I normally just skip step three and\nhit Okay and come back to it later.\n\n82\n00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,800\nSo that's exactly what I'm gonna do.\n\n83\n00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,672\nI'm just gonna hit Okay on that one.\n\n84\n00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,490\nAll right.\n\n85\n00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,370\nNow, if you had cleared out that setup\nwizard without actually using it before,\n\n86\n00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,570\nyou can still get into all of that stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,020\nIf you go up top into your menus here and\nyou go under Edit and\n\n88\n00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,140\nPreferences under the General tab,\nthat's where step number one was,\n\n89\n00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,950\nand under Dynamips,\nthat's where step number two was.\n\n90\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,120\nSo that's how you get to\nthose two without the Wizard,\n\n91\n00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,620\nso don't worry if you've cleared that out.\n\n92\n00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,340\nAll right.\n\n93\n00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,920\nSo we're good there.\n\n94\n00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,970\nNow, what about these iOS images\nthat they want me to load?\n\n95\n00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,530\nWell, in order to use\none of these routers,\n\n96\n00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,350\nyou've got to have an operating\nsystem manage for it.\n\n97\n00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,430\nSee how they're all grayed\nout when I look at the list?\n\n98\n00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,470\nI can't take, like, a 72 hundred and\ndrag it and drop it.\n\n99\n00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,330\nAnd that's because, well, there's a little\nwarning at the bottom of the screen there\n\n100\n00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,210\njust kind of letting me know,\nI don't have an image for it.\n\n101\n00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,290\nIt's not a valid system.\n\n102\n00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,700\nI can't bring it out there.\n\n103\n00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,760\nVersus if I take a look at switches,\nsee how these are lit up?\n\n104\n00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,070\nIt will let me take one of\nthese switches and drag it and\n\n105\n00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,280\ndrop it out here on the screen.\n\n106\n00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,120\nAnd that's because these\nare fake switches,\n\n107\n00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,300\nthey don't need an operating system,\nthey have one built into GNS3.\n\n108\n00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,680\nThis isn't like a Cisco switch or\nanything, it's just fake.\n\n109\n00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,280\nRight.\n\n110\n00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840\nAnd you'll see some of the other stuff.\n\n111\n00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,250\nLike here, I can drag out a host\ncause I've reinstalled the VPCS.\n\n112\n00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,750\nBut I can't install a VirtualBox guest or\n\n113\n00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,400\na QEMU guest because I haven't\nset that stuff up yet, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,340\nSo we need to get it\na router operating system.\n\n115\n00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,030\nHow do we do that?\n\n116\n00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,580\nWell, step one, you have to obtain one.\n\n117\n00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,210\nYou've got to get a Cisco iOS image\n\n118\n00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,040\nif you have a fully licensed Cisco router,\nyou can get the image right off of it.\n\n119\n00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040\nRight?\nAnd that's what I've done.\n\n120\n00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,320\nI pulled the images off of\nequipment that we have.\n\n121\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,760\nIf you have a Cisco SMARTnet agreement,\nyou can go in and\n\n122\n00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,960\nlog into Cisco's web page and\ndownload it right from there.\n\n123\n00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,120\nAll right?\n\n124\n00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,090\nIf you don't have any of those things,\nthough, then you're kind of on your own.\n\n125\n00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,940\nHow do you get the iOS image, and you\nknow I'm not gonna hand out any links or\n\n126\n00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,120\nanything like that, but you're literally\none Google search away from finding\n\n127\n00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,130\niOS images all over the place.\n\n128\n00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,980\nJust keep in mind that you do need\nto be responsible about this.\n\n129\n00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,600\nYou need to have an actual Cisco\nlicense to be on the up and up.\n\n130\n00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,840\nAll right.\n\n131\n00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,830\nFor me, I've got a little folder here\nwhere I've stuck a couple of Cisco\n\n132\n00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,040\niOS images.\n\n133\n00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,330\nAnd you really just need one.\n\n134\n00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,562\nYou don't necessarily\nneed a bunch of them.\n\n135\n00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:11,350\nSure, Dynamip supports like six\ndifferent router types, right.\n\n136\n00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,570\nThat's what I've got,\nis the different iOS's for those routers.\n\n137\n00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,180\nYou're typically gonna pick one,\nand stick with it.\n\n138\n00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,675\nYou'll pick one of the router types that\nhas all the functions that you need and\n\n139\n00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:21,535\nyou run with that.\n\n140\n00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:23,525\nThe 7200s are a really good example.\n\n141\n00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,605\nThe 7200 is so powerful,\nit can do so many different things.\n\n142\n00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:30,275\nYou don't really have a need for any of\nthese other routers unless you are trying\n\n143\n00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:34,805\nto emulate that specific hardware for\nsome kind of testing purpose or pre built\n\n144\n00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:41,600\nconfigs or whatever My two favorite\nrouters that I use, the 7200 and 3725.\n\n145\n00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,400\nThose two guys right there,\nbetween the two of them you can get a lot\n\n146\n00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,010\nof power outta your system and\nget stuff done.\n\n147\n00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,930\nNow, when it said it need iOS images,\n\n148\n00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,580\nit said uncompressed iOS images,\nwhat's it talking about?\n\n149\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,280\nWell, GNS3 will actually take the iOS\nimages right here like they are,\n\n150\n00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,550\nstraight off of a Cisco router.\n\n151\n00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,290\nSo this is if I don't mess with it,\n\n152\n00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,620\njust take it right off of a Cisco system,\nwe can throw it in there.\n\n153\n00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,900\nBut Cisco actually\ncompresses their iOS images.\n\n154\n00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,430\nWhen you boot a Cisco router,\nif you've ever watched it,\n\n155\n00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,880\nyou'll see these little hash marks\nappear across the screen, and\n\n156\n00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,950\nthey'll scroll around,\nand around, and around.\n\n157\n00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,480\nAnd the system boots up.\n\n158\n00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,200\nWhat, it's doing is it's decompressing\nthe iOS image and copying it to RAM.\n\n159\n00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,830\nWell, GS3 can do that too.\n\n160\n00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,460\nAnd you'll see the hash marks as it\ndecompresses it and loads it into the RAM.\n\n161\n00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,850\nThey do that on the Cisco routers\nbecause flash is at a premium.\n\n162\n00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,100\nYou only have so much flash storage\nto store the iOS image, and\n\n163\n00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,050\nthey want to leave as much\nspace available as possible.\n\n164\n00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,340\nBut on your computer, you got a ton of\nspace, you don't really care about that.\n\n165\n00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,490\nSo we can decompress\nthe files ahead of time.\n\n166\n00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,030\nThey're just zipped up.\n\n167\n00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,460\nThey're actually zip archives.\n\n168\n00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,890\nI know it doesn't say that,\nbut I can take something.\n\n169\n00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,990\nLike here, I'll take this\niOS image here for the 7200.\n\n170\n00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,730\nAnd I'm gonna rename it,\njust add .zip to the end of it.\n\n171\n00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,360\nOkay.\n\n172\n00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,840\nSo, I just stuck .zip on the end,\nnow it's a zip file.\n\n173\n00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,690\nAnd if I right click on it and\n\n174\n00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,930\nchoose Extract All,\nI'll just let it extract the file.\n\n175\n00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,320\nAnd, oh I'm getting zip is invalid,\nyou know,\n\n176\n00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,140\nI might have already decompressed\nthis one, but I didn't think I had.\n\n177\n00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,260\nI was trying to use\nthe Windows Zip program.\n\n178\n00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,010\nLet me try 7Zip instead.\n\n179\n00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,176\nYou know, if Windows doesn't work,\nwhich is not uncommon,\n\n180\n00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:28,200\n[LAUGH] you can always jump over and\nuse some other archiving software.\n\n181\n00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,700\nI'll give it a shot with 7Zip.\n\n182\n00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,400\nBut typically, we just decompress\nthe file and there you go.\n\n183\n00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,290\nYou got it.\nIt'll be much larger\n\n184\n00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,690\nonce it's decompressed, but\nat least you'll have it.\n\n185\n00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,010\nSo let me just get one of these\ninstalled and we'll run through that.\n\n186\n00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,750\nNow, while I'm waiting on that,\nmaybe I'll try another one just to see.\n\n187\n00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,170\nI'll take the zip off the end of that\none and we'll try like this 3725 image,\n\n188\n00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,630\nor here I'll try one that's really small,\nlike this 62 or 2600 image.\n\n189\n00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,180\nI'll just add zip to the end and\ngive it a shot.\n\n190\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,130\nSee how many times my\ncomputer can gripe at me.\n\n191\n00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,130\nYeah, and Windows doesn't seem to like\nthat but basically you just decompress and\n\n192\n00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,710\nthe file will be larger.\n\n193\n00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,050\nAnd what that means is in GNS3,\n\n194\n00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,770\nwhen you load up the file,\nit'll load that much faster.\n\n195\n00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,920\nIt'll actually fire up pretty quick\nbecause it doesn't have to decompress it.\n\n196\n00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,125\nSo, it would just say a little bit\nof time there, but not that much.\n\n197\n00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,100\n[SOUND] Now, on faster computers,\non newer computers I usually don't bother\n\n198\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,212\nwith decompressing them because it just\ndoesn't take very long to boot at all.\n\n199\n00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:34,240\nI'm not running from Flash on a router's\nmotherboard with a 486 processor.\n\n200\n00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,670\nI'm running on my laptop that has\nan I7 and is considerably faster, so\n\n201\n00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,510\nthat compression time just\nisn't that big of a deal.\n\n202\n00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,430\nAll right.\n\n203\n00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,730\nLet's try this again with 7Zip,\nwhich should be installed now.\n\n204\n00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,170\nHere it is.\nLet's\n\n205\n00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,180\nsee if it has any better luck for us.\n\n206\n00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,060\nSo, I'll take that 7200 again, and\nI'll just put dot zip on the end.\n\n207\n00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,640\nThis time, seven zip is happy with it.\n\n208\n00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,070\nSo I just extracted it and there it is.\n\n209\n00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,980\nNotice the file name is now wrong,\nbut it's showing C7200-AD.bin,\n\n210\n00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,140\nthat's what just came out of this\nadvanced enterprise image right here.\n\n211\n00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,050\nIt was 36 megs in size,\nnow it's 90 megs in size.\n\n212\n00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,070\nSo it over doubled in size.\n\n213\n00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,700\nThat's why they compress these,\nso it'll take less room on flash.\n\n214\n00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,630\nSo now that I've got that,\nI can just take it and\n\n215\n00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,800\nI'll I'll take this other filename and\nrename this one.\n\n216\n00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,180\nThat way I can remember\nexactly what it was, right?\n\n217\n00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,130\nSo that's my uncompressed version.\n\n218\n00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,410\nBut even though the screen told me to use\nuncompressed ones, you can use either one,\n\n219\n00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:40,930\n1408, alright?\n\n220\n00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,110\nNow I just need to go and\ntell GNS3 that I've got this.\n\n221\n00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,090\nSo back in GNS3 right here,\n\n222\n00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,720\nwe can go to Edit and Preferences, or\nactually, we don't need to go there,\n\n223\n00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,170\nwe can go to Edit, and iOS images,\nand hypervisors right there.\n\n224\n00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,305\nAnd that's where we're gonna\ngive it our iOS images.\n\n225\n00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:05,065\nYou can load different iOS images for\neach hardware platform.\n\n226\n00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,775\nAnd you can load more than one image for\n\n227\n00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,315\nthe same platform, cuz you might want\nto have two routers that are running\n\n228\n00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:13,905\ndifferent versions of the iOS to test\ninteroperability or something like that.\n\n229\n00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,625\nYou got a lot of flexibility there.\n\n230\n00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,315\nBut you start by doing the image files.\n\n231\n00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:21,189\nSo, I'll just browse and find that image\nfile, so I put that on my desktop.\n\n232\n00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,540\nAnd I did that 7200 image file.\n\n233\n00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,120\nThat guy right there.\n\n234\n00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,720\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,540\nIt recognized that it was a 7200, so\nit updated these values to reflect that.\n\n236\n00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,930\nIt's got the file path is all right there.\n\n237\n00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,700\nIt's got how much memory\nthe system is going to have.\n\n238\n00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,110\nNow, this system defaults to having 256\nmegs of RAM, and I'm okay with that.\n\n239\n00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,750\nBe aware that each router you fire up,\n\n240\n00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,560\nthat's the amount of memory\nthat it's going to take.\n\n241\n00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,990\nSo, if I have is set\nto 256 megs of RAM and\n\n242\n00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,690\nI fire up ten of these,\nthat's going to be two and\n\n243\n00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,800\na half gigs of RAM that I will need to\nbe able to power all those routers.\n\n244\n00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320\nNow, GNS3 has some optimization features\navailable that can help with that.\n\n245\n00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,030\nBut for the most part,\nyou need a plan for the amount of memory.\n\n246\n00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,640\nThat's why just because you can do a 7200,\ndoesn't mean you'll always want to.\n\n247\n00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,680\nYou might want to do, you know,\na couple of 37 hundreds or whatever,\n\n248\n00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,260\ncause they use less memory and\nyou can use more of them on your system.\n\n249\n00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,020\nNow, there's this check mark right here\nthat says default image for this platform.\n\n250\n00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,400\nRemember I said you can load more than\none iOS for a particular platform, and\n\n251\n00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,890\nso you flag one as the default and then\nyou can over ride it later on as needed.\n\n252\n00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,000\nI'm gonna hit Save, and so\nhere's that first image loaded in.\n\n253\n00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400\nIt's warning me about idle PC.\n\n254\n00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,692\nWell, we'll deal with that later.\n\n255\n00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,740\nAll right.\n\n256\n00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,880\nThen, I can go back and load other ones.\n\n257\n00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,170\nSo I can go in and I can pick one of\nthese other 7200 platform images.\n\n258\n00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,080\nI'm gonna take this guy, alright.\n\n259\n00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,320\nAnd here,\nit's warning me that it's compressed.\n\n260\n00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,700\nAnd it's saying,\nwould you like to uncompress it.\n\n261\n00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,350\nAnd, it'll actually uncompress it for me.\n\n262\n00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,520\nSo, I'll say yes.\n\n263\n00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,120\nThat's where it'll take either form, and\n\n264\n00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,060\nthen once it's got it,\nit recognized it as a 7200.\n\n265\n00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,970\nI'm gonna uncheck the default\noption on that one and hit Save.\n\n266\n00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,340\nNow, I've got two different images.\n\n267\n00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,350\nI've got a 15.2 iOS and a 12.4 iOS.\n\n268\n00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,270\nSo if I ever want to bounce between\nthe two for testing, I can do that, right.\n\n269\n00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,470\nBut my 15.2 is the one that\nI flagged as the default.\n\n270\n00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,700\nYou'll see it's got\nthe check mark down here.\n\n271\n00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,280\nAnd I just keep going adding whatever\nother platforms that it is that\n\n272\n00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,150\nI may need.\n\n273\n00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,720\nSo maybe I want to go in and\nadd that 37.25 that I mentioned.\n\n274\n00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,230\nNotice that it defaults to 28 megs of RAM.\n\n275\n00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,450\nSo if I stick to 37 hundreds, I can\nhave twice as many of them on my system.\n\n276\n00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,630\nSo I'll save that one and so on.\n\n277\n00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,370\nOnce those are in there,\nyou can hit Close.\n\n278\n00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,900\nAnd now when I go to my routers,\nsee how the 3700 and 7200 are lit up?\n\n279\n00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,600\nNow, I can start to drag those out and\nuse them in my system.\n\n280\n00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,980\nI'm actually ready to get in here and\nstart using GNS3.\n\n281\n00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,520\nAt this point,\nwe've completed our initial setup.\n\n282\n00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,980\nNow, we're ready to use it.\n\n283\n00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,300\nAll right.\nWell, let's stop here.\n\n284\n00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,290\nAnd in our next video, we'll jump into\nhow to get the routers configured and\n\n285\n00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,310\noperational.\n\n286\n00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,410\nActually, see some fun stuff\nhappening inside of GNS3.\n\n287\n00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,880\nSo, I hope to see you then.\n\n288\n00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,845\nTake it easy.\n\n289\n00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:17,624\n[NOISE]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,886\n[SOUND] All right, so\n\n2\n00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:10,252\nnow we've got GNS3 installed.\n\n3\n00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,870\nIt's set up, and it's ready to rock!\n\n4\n00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,940\nLet's get to work!\n\n5\n00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,720\nWell, there's actually just\na little bit more to it.\n\n6\n00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,610\nWe can drag and\n\n7\n00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,890\ndrop our routers right onto the screen and\nstart to build our environment.\n\n8\n00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,750\nBut getting that first router set up can\nactually be a little bit daunting because\n\n9\n00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,770\nof the idle PC value.\n\n10\n00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,950\nIdle PC is something that we need\nto get configured on the system\n\n11\n00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,060\nin order to get the system\nto run efficiently.\n\n12\n00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,050\nNow wat do I mean by that?\n\n13\n00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,170\nWell when the Cisco IOS fires up, it is\nthe only thing running on a Cisco router.\n\n14\n00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,080\nThat whole set of hardware is\ndedicated entirely to the IOS.\n\n15\n00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,300\nSo when the IOS fires up, it immediately\nreserves 100% of the memory and\n\n16\n00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,050\n100% of the CPU on the system.\n\n17\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,660\nWell, as far as memory,\nI've got these things capped.\n\n18\n00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,180\nRight?\nSo if I take one of these 7200's,\n\n19\n00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,370\nit's capped at 256 megs of RAM.\n\n20\n00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,680\nSo when I drag it out, if it consumes 256\nmegs of RAM, I'm okay with that, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,380\nI think I have 8 gigs of RAM on my laptop,\nor 16, or something like that.\n\n22\n00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,080\nSo, I've got plenty of memory\nto be able to handle that.\n\n23\n00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,460\nBut CPU, if it tries to grab a 100% of my\nCPU, what's that gonna do to the system?\n\n24\n00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,340\nIt's going to slow it to a crawl.\n\n25\n00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,610\nSo what Idle PC does, is it looks at that\nand it says all right, the router is only\n\n26\n00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,790\ndoing so much, the rest of the CPU that\nit's consuming are just idle timers.\n\n27\n00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,630\nAnd we can exclude those idle timers\nto free up that CPU back to our system.\n\n28\n00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,450\nSo if I just throw a router out there\non my system and start it up, I'll\n\n29\n00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,350\nsee that my system runs kind of poorly\nuntil I calculate out an idle PC value.\n\n30\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,850\nNow, You'll hear a lot of people say\ndifferent things about how to do this.\n\n31\n00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,540\nI'm gonna show you what works best for me.\n\n32\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,930\nWhen you first take a router out,\nso I'll take this 7200.\n\n33\n00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,290\nI'm gonna drag it out here and\nthrow it out.\n\n34\n00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,650\nSo now I've got router two.\n\n35\n00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,290\nNow, it's turned off.\n\n36\n00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,850\nI can tell that cuz right here where it\nsays router two it's got a nice little red\n\n37\n00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,050\ncircle by it so I know it's not running,\nand if I look at my task manager, I\n\n38\n00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,540\ncan look at my performance and I can kind\nof see how my system's running right now.\n\n39\n00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,720\nI'm averaging, you know it looks\nlike about 20% CPU right now.\n\n40\n00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,980\nThat's gonna be my\nscreen sharing software.\n\n41\n00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,260\nMy screen sharing software consumes a good\nbit of CPU and so I'm losing about 20%.\n\n42\n00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,700\nBut the system's kind of flatlined.\n\n43\n00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,610\nYou'll see it's just operating\nright there at about 20%.\n\n44\n00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,660\nAll right?\n\n45\n00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,410\nWatch when I start this router.\n\n46\n00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,585\nLet me make this always on top, there.\n\n47\n00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:41,610\nThere, okay, so let me give this a second\nso we can see that flatline again.\n\n48\n00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,630\nAnd I'm gonna start that router and\nwe're gonna see that change.\n\n49\n00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,640\nSo I see it flatlining at 20% again.\n\n50\n00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,460\nAnd now I'm gonna start this router,\n\n51\n00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,940\nto start it I just right click on it, if\nyou right click on it you can go to start.\n\n52\n00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,360\nThis little green arrow right here,\nI'll go ahead and start it up, all right.\n\n53\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,690\nNow when it start's it\ntakes it a moment right?\n\n54\n00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,960\nIt's booting up just like\na real Cisco router, and\n\n55\n00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,320\nwatch my CPU utilization\nwhen that happens.\n\n56\n00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,880\nAll right.\n\n57\n00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,800\nSo it's starting to creep up and\n\n58\n00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,260\nthat's because that router is consuming\nmore CPU than it should right.\n\n59\n00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,100\nSo now I've gone from averaging 20%\nCPU to averaging close to 50% CPU.\n\n60\n00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,912\nNow I've got multiple\ncores in this system.\n\n61\n00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,670\nCisco routers don't\nrecognize multiple cores so\n\n62\n00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,190\nit can't exceed the core and\nin this view I don't really see it.\n\n63\n00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,410\nSee how I've got two cores and\nfour logical processors.\n\n64\n00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,850\nSo I'm averaging 50% since these\nrouters are single threaded\n\n65\n00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,640\nthat means I'm maxing out one\nof the cores in my laptop.\n\n66\n00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,000\nOne of my cores is running at 100%.\n\n67\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,680\nSo I need to fix that, most of this is\njust junk process anyway, it's just idles\n\n68\n00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,290\nthat are being held cuz the iOS is use\nto having full reign on the CPU, right.\n\n69\n00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,830\nSo what we do is while\nthe router is running,\n\n70\n00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,250\nwe need to run a little scan on\nit to figure out what's idle.\n\n71\n00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,530\nNow, it's been my experience that if\nyou just try and do this right off,\n\n72\n00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,040\nit never quite works right.\n\n73\n00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,130\nThe best thing to do is to open\nup a console connection first.\n\n74\n00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,900\nOn a brand new router one of the things\nyou wanna do is plug into the console\n\n75\n00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,510\nport so you can start to work with it.\n\n76\n00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,980\nWell since these are virtual routers, we\nvirtually connect to their console port.\n\n77\n00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,860\nIf you right click on the router,\n\n78\n00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,020\nyou'll see an option here\nthat says console, alright.\n\n79\n00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,790\nAnd we can choose that, not this console\nvia AUX, right, that's the auxiliary port.\n\n80\n00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,510\nWe want this one that just says Console.\n\n81\n00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,460\nAnd when you click on that,\nit'll use putty and fire up and\n\n82\n00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,060\nget you a console interface, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,450\nI find that the idle PC\nvalues never work right\n\n84\n00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,870\nunless you're actually at\njust a regular router prompt.\n\n85\n00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,510\nIf it's still sitting there saying\npress return to get started,\n\n86\n00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,310\na lot of times the idle\nPC values don't work.\n\n87\n00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,080\nSo I'm just making here\nthat I'm right here.\n\n88\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,730\nThe router is finished booting up, and\nthe router is actually sitting there idle.\n\n89\n00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,770\nThat's what you really want,\nthe router doing nothing.\n\n90\n00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,430\nNow that I know that it's there,\nI can go back, and\n\n91\n00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,080\nlet me just kind of move this\nout of the way a little bit,\n\n92\n00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,985\nI can go back in here and\nI can right click on the router.\n\n93\n00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:09,280\n[LAUGH] Trying to find a place where we\ncan stick this where we can still see it,\n\n94\n00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,420\nbut it's not a super burden for us.\n\n95\n00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,350\nWe can right click on the router and\nyou will see an option called idle PC.\n\n96\n00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,160\nThat's where we go to calculate\nthat idle PC value and\n\n97\n00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,220\nwhen you click on it's\ngoing to run a scan.\n\n98\n00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,595\nNow if you have already done this,\n\n99\n00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:28,170\nit'll disable the idle PC value you've\nalready got, so you'll see your CPU go up.\n\n100\n00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,920\nMy CPU is already up\nbecause I've never run it.\n\n101\n00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,920\nIt runs a scan and it tries to identify\nthe idle processes on the router.\n\n102\n00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,530\nAnd so you'll get a little\npop-up that looks like this and\n\n103\n00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,380\nit has a drop-down box with a number\nof hexadecimal addresses in it.\n\n104\n00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,030\nAll right.\n\n105\n00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,440\nIt's trying to identify which\nhex address contains the idle\n\n106\n00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,830\nsequences for the router.\n\n107\n00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,180\nIf we pick the right one,\nwe'll see our CP utilization drop.\n\n108\n00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,160\nIf we pick the wrong one,\nour CP utilization will stay high.\n\n109\n00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560\nAll right?\n\n110\n00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,370\nWell, it tries to help you out.\n\n111\n00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,540\nIt looks and\nit figures out the most likely candidates.\n\n112\n00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,220\nThe most likely candidates will\nhave an asterisk beside them.\n\n113\n00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,500\nSo see I've got two right here with\nasterisks on the left side, right.\n\n114\n00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,140\nSo it's gonna be one of these two.\n\n115\n00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,930\nI've got one that's you know a hex\naddress and so is the other one.\n\n116\n00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,800\nAnd then in square brackets beside it\none says 52 and one says 57, all right.\n\n117\n00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,990\nIf you have more than one\nvalue with an asterisk.\n\n118\n00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,410\nYou generally wanna pick the one with\nthe highest number in brackets, so\n\n119\n00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,140\nI've got 52 and 57.\n\n120\n00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,480\nI'll pick 57, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,670\nIf you've got a tie, if you've got\nmore than one with an asterisk,\n\n122\n00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,020\npick the one with the highest\nnumber in brackets.\n\n123\n00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,840\nIf you've only got one with an asterisk,\nthen you know which one to pick.\n\n124\n00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,120\nIf you've got none with an asterisk,\nit usually means it\n\n125\n00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,220\ncouldn't identify the idle sequences, this\ntypically happens if the router is busy\n\n126\n00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,330\ndoing something when you run the idle PC\ncalculation and you need to run it again.\n\n127\n00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,680\nAll right, but if you run it a few\ntimes and you still don't get one with\n\n128\n00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,310\nan asterisk, you can just try and pick\nwhich ever one has the highest number.\n\n129\n00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,725\nYou'll know right away whether it works if\nyou're watching your system utilization\n\n130\n00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,140\ncuz you'll actually see it.\n\n131\n00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,520\nSo for me, if I take this I can\nsee what I'm running at right now.\n\n132\n00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,980\nAlright, so there I am kind of\nrunning it at that 50% CPU,\n\n133\n00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,680\nlet me make that a little bit bigger.\n\n134\n00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,300\nThere, so\n\n135\n00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,280\nI can see myself running it at a 50% CPU,\nI'm gonna pick this value and hit apply.\n\n136\n00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,940\nOkay.\n\n137\n00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,030\nWhen you hit apply it takes effect,\nand if you picked the right one,\n\n138\n00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,520\nyou 'll see exactly what I just saw.\n\n139\n00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360\nAll right.\n\n140\n00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,770\nMy system was running at 20% CPU\nbefore because of my screen share,\n\n141\n00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,360\nit jumped up to 50% CPU\nwhen I started the router.\n\n142\n00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,090\nNow that I applied that idle PC,\nit dropped down and I'm averaging 22%.\n\n143\n00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,342\nSo that means that the router\nis really only consuming 1% or\n\n144\n00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,320\n2% of my system, versus the 30%\nit was consuming a moment ago.\n\n145\n00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,531\nThat makes a big difference,\nif you're gonna run more than on router,\n\n146\n00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:56,671\nyou've got to calculate\nout an idle PCU value,\n\n147\n00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,042\notherwise you're just gonna\nrun out of resources.\n\n148\n00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,672\nIt doesn't matter how beefy your system\nis, and if this is the wrong one, if it\n\n149\n00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:06,583\ndidn't work, you can just drop it down and\npick some of the other values, you know.\n\n150\n00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,208\nExperiment around until you find\nthe one that gets you the best result.\n\n151\n00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,292\nSo if I switch here to\nthis one that says 31.\n\n152\n00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,140\nWell, actually, it looks like you\nget about the same on that one.\n\n153\n00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,090\nNot seeing much difference there.\n\n154\n00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,170\nSo, you can kind of roam around these.\n\n155\n00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,830\nHitting apply each time\nto see which one works.\n\n156\n00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,030\nFor me, that, yeah,\nit all seems to be about the same.\n\n157\n00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,030\nSo I'll stick with the 57.\n\n158\n00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,530\nAnd hit OK.\n\n159\n00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,100\nNow, I've got an idle PC value\ncalculated for router 2.\n\n160\n00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,480\nAnd that means that for\nany 7200 series router that I bring out.\n\n161\n00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,950\nIt's going have that idle PC value.\n\n162\n00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,040\nSo if I grab another 7200 and\nthrow it out here, and I start it up.\n\n163\n00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,420\nThere it goes, and watch my CPUs.\n\n164\n00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,120\nMy CPU just went to 50%.\n\n165\n00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,130\nWell, the router's starting, it's actually\ndoing a lot right now while it boots up.\n\n166\n00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,420\nAnd I can watch it in the console, and\nsee it go through its boot process.\n\n167\n00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,540\nSo here it goes booting up.\n\n168\n00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960\nAnd then when it's done.\n\n169\n00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,020\nSee that my CPU spiked back down.\n\n170\n00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,120\nIt finished booting, I got to a regular\nprompt, and now it drops back down, and\n\n171\n00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,630\nthere we are.\n\n172\n00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,310\nSo keep an eye on that.\n\n173\n00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,480\nYou may need to recalculate\nidle PC values later on.\n\n174\n00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,750\nFor example, say you start to\nturn on a bunch of features.\n\n175\n00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,160\nYou turn on VPN and all that stuff.\n\n176\n00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,440\nWell, your idle PC value might\nnot truly be accurate anymore.\n\n177\n00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,680\nIf you start to see your CPU utilizations\nclimbing, just recalculate the Idle CPU.\n\n178\n00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,690\nJust keep in mind it is\ndone on the platform.\n\n179\n00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,370\nSo when I calculate it here for\nthis router,\n\n180\n00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,060\nit's going to apply for\nevery 7200 that I start up out there.\n\n181\n00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,730\nIf I start up a different platform.\n\n182\n00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,380\nSo, let's say, I take a 3600 and\nI'll throw it out here.\n\n183\n00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,990\nAlright.\n\n184\n00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,960\nSo, here's router 4, it's a 3600.\n\n185\n00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,870\nWhen I start it up, well,\nit's going to fire up.\n\n186\n00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,380\nAnd it's a different hardware platform.\n\n187\n00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,360\nSo, the idle PC is not\ngoing to apply to it.\n\n188\n00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,670\nSo here it's booting.\n\n189\n00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,890\nI'm sitting here at a nice\nflat command prompt, and\n\n190\n00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,230\nmy CPU utilization is still high.\n\n191\n00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,140\nSo I'll need to calculate an idle CPU for\nthat one too.\n\n192\n00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,840\nSame process just right click on it and\ngo to idle PC.\n\n193\n00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,440\nAnd it's recalculating there in\nthe background, just shows the GNS3 logo.\n\n194\n00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,810\nAnd it says right here,\nplease wait while calculating idle PC.\n\n195\n00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,840\nYou typically don't want to be doing other\nthings on your system while that runs.\n\n196\n00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,180\nAnd it looks like I've only got one value\nwith an asterisk this time, just that one.\n\n197\n00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,680\nLet's see how well it works.\n\n198\n00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,530\nSo we'll go ahead and apply that.\n\n199\n00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,170\nAnd sure enough that was the right one.\n\n200\n00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,300\nReal important, you don't have to have\na beefy machine to run these routers.\n\n201\n00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,630\nMost Cisco routers have very\nantiquated CPU's in them.\n\n202\n00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,640\nAnd that's because they have ASIC's in\nthem, application specific integrated\n\n203\n00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,770\ncircuits that are doing the true routing,\nand decision making.\n\n204\n00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,110\nThe CPU is really just booting the IOS and\nthrowing it in RAM.\n\n205\n00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,030\nSo they'll have 486s.\n\n206\n00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,610\nThey'll have Cyrix processors.\n\n207\n00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,320\nThey'll have all sorts of\nweird processors in there.\n\n208\n00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,190\nPPCs, the old power PC processors.\n\n209\n00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,070\nThey'll have stuff like that,\nbecause that's all they need.\n\n210\n00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,490\nIt doesn't take a beefy machine to do it.\n\n211\n00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,010\nBut if you don't calculate an idle PC,\n\n212\n00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,240\nthose routers can bring\nyour system to a crawl.\n\n213\n00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,240\nEven though your CPU was way better\nthan what might be in a physical router.\n\n214\n00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,050\nOnce that's done, now we're ready to\nget in there and start using GNS3.\n\n215\n00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,230\nSo, we've got tat value configured.\n\n216\n00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240\nNow it's time to set up our routers.\n\n217\n00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,650\nNow I've already dragged\nout a few routers here.\n\n218\n00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,560\nAnd kind of shown you what's involved\nwith just throwing them out there on\n\n219\n00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,060\nthe screen.\n\n220\n00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,990\nWe might be ready to go and fire them up.\n\n221\n00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,890\nBut typically we need to do a little more.\n\n222\n00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,330\nWe need to tweak their\nhardware to meet our needs.\n\n223\n00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,130\nAnd we need to plug them in.\n\n224\n00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,930\nThere's no cables between these routers.\n\n225\n00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,170\nSo they're not gonna be very\neffective without a cable.\n\n226\n00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,640\nWell, the first thing we need to know is\nhow to turn on and off these routers.\n\n227\n00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,870\nWhen you right click on them\nyou get this full menu.\n\n228\n00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,470\nAnd you'll see Start, Suspend, and Stop.\n\n229\n00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,040\nStart powers them on,\nStop powers them off.\n\n230\n00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,390\nSuspend freezes them in time.\n\n231\n00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,440\nIt's like taking a snapshot\nof a virtual machine.\n\n232\n00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,190\nIt freezes it in time, stops it running so\nyou can resume it later on.\n\n233\n00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,440\nAlright, now once you start them, they're\nfired up and they're ready to work with.\n\n234\n00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,600\nIf they're started up you'll see a little\ngreen light on the router name on\n\n235\n00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,930\nthe right side here in our summary.\n\n236\n00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,240\nSo you can see whether they're on or off.\n\n237\n00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,020\nAlright, you'll also get\na list of their interfaces if\n\n238\n00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,000\nyou have anything plugged in.\n\n239\n00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,340\nMine aren't plugged in.\n\n240\n00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,800\nAlright, one quick word of advice.\n\n241\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,630\nI've got that stop button, and\nstart and suspend and a reload button.\n\n242\n00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,190\nIf you ever wanna reboot your router, you\nwanna right-click on it and choose reload.\n\n243\n00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,150\nNow you might say, well can't I just\nreload it from the inside of the router?\n\n244\n00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,070\nWell because the storage of\nthe router is being emulated,\n\n245\n00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,550\nit can't actually do its own reload.\n\n246\n00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,430\nSo like, here I am on this router three.\n\n247\n00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,550\nIf I run DIR, that would\nnormally show me what's in flash.\n\n248\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,780\nBut these routers don't have true flash,\nbecause the storage system is emulated.\n\n249\n00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,460\nSo they don't see the IOS.\n\n250\n00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,790\nSo if I do a reload from here It's\nnot gonna be very happy about that.\n\n251\n00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,710\nAnd in fact the router's gonna\nlock back up, I believe.\n\n252\n00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,920\nLet's give it a second here.\n\n253\n00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,340\nHere's a ROM reload, and then it freezes.\n\n254\n00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,310\nSo here it is just kinda stuck.\n\n255\n00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,780\nAnd it's not actually reloading.\n\n256\n00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,660\nAll right?\n\n257\n00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,830\nSo if you wanna reload your router,\ndon't do it from inside of the router.\n\n258\n00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,000\nInstead do it from here.\n\n259\n00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,390\nJust right-click on the router and\nchoose reload, and it'll do it.\n\n260\n00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,360\nThat'll handle the issues with having\nvirtualized storage, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160\nEvery other command on the router works,\nexcept for\n\n262\n00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,210\nthe commands that interact with storage.\n\n263\n00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:43,590\nSo, when it comes to upgrading an iOS\nimage, or reloading the router like that.\n\n264\n00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,630\nThe virtualized storage causes a problem.\n\n265\n00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,680\nSaving your configs.\n\n266\n00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,790\nThat's fine.\n\n267\n00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,810\nEven putting like the IPS\nsignature files on there.\n\n268\n00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,500\nThat's fine.\nThat stuff all works.\n\n269\n00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,360\nBut this one little piece doesn't.\n\n270\n00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,720\nSo, just want to point that\nout here before we get to far.\n\n271\n00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,110\nAlright, other things we\nmight want to customize.\n\n272\n00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,680\nIf you take your router, and shut it down.\n\n273\n00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,140\nSo I'm just going to hit\nstop to power off router 2.\n\n274\n00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,090\nSo router 2 is now powered off.\n\n275\n00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,630\nWhile they're off you can right\nclick on them and choose configure.\n\n276\n00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,950\nWhen you go to configure them, here's\nwhere we can go and choose our hardware.\n\n277\n00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,290\nI've got a 7200 VXR,\nthat's what this router is.\n\n278\n00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,830\nAnd so when I click on router 2 here,\nI'll see that hardware laid out.\n\n279\n00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,090\nAnd I can start to pick\nsome different adjustments,\n\n280\n00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,320\ndo I want this to be a standard 7200?\n\n281\n00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,390\nThe older one, or do I want it to\nbe a VXR which is the newer one?\n\n282\n00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,290\nI can pick from the NPE, our processing\nengine that's inside of there.\n\n283\n00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,500\nWhen you buy a 7200,\nthe processing engine that sticks in it.\n\n284\n00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,580\nIt has a couple of network\njacks that are on it.\n\n285\n00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,960\nAnd which engine you pick,\nsupports different things.\n\n286\n00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,530\nBy default, it goes to the NPE 400,\nwhich is one of the more powerful ones.\n\n287\n00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,800\nAnd, so,\nthat's what we normally stick with.\n\n288\n00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,730\nYou've got memory and disk.\n\n289\n00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,370\nHere's where I can pick how much\nRAM it has and how much NV RAM.\n\n290\n00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,230\nThe defaults are normally more\nthan suitable for us, but\n\n291\n00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,490\nin your environment you might need more.\n\n292\n00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,820\nYou might need a little\nmore storage in there.\n\n293\n00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,020\nYou can bump it up, or\nadd more RAM to it if you want, alright.\n\n294\n00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,360\nThis particular router has\nremovable flash in it.\n\n295\n00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,060\nSo it's got here where I can pick\nhow much removable flash it's got.\n\n296\n00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,300\nKeep in mind that this is going\nto be limited by the iOS.\n\n297\n00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,940\nThe iOS can only address flash\ncards of a certain size.\n\n298\n00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,220\nJust depends on which version\nof iOS you're running.\n\n299\n00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,570\nYou could specify a value here that's too\nbig, typically we stick with the defaults.\n\n300\n00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,010\nSlots though, this is the fun part.\n\n301\n00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,290\nMost of your Cisco routers are modular.\n\n302\n00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,100\nThey've got slots in them where you can\nadd in different cards and functionality.\n\n303\n00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,920\nAnd, here's where we can pick that.\n\n304\n00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,190\nA 7200 is a big router.\n\n305\n00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,750\nIt's got a ton of slots.\n\n306\n00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,210\nOther routers, like a 2600,\nis a small router.\n\n307\n00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,210\nIt doesn't have a lot of slots.\n\n308\n00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,250\nSo, if I go to configure it,\nAnd I go to it's slots page.\n\n309\n00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,292\nYou'll see most of these\nslots are grayed out.\n\n310\n00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,060\nI can't click on them, all right.\n\n311\n00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,600\nIn fact it's got two slots, and\ntwo wicks that I pick from.\n\n312\n00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,470\nAnd so here it's got two Fast Ethernet\nports inserted in the router right now.\n\n313\n00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,880\nI could add some more,\nanother Fast Ethernet or\n\n314\n00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,890\none of those 16-port switch\ncards that are terrible.\n\n315\n00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,610\nWhatever it is that I wanna put in\nthe system, I can choose that card.\n\n316\n00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,404\nDown here I can pick the WICs,\ndo I want it to have a WIC-1T, a WIC-2T?\n\n317\n00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:25,660\nAnd I can even double that up so if I want\nthis to be like some kind of centralized\n\n318\n00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,280\nT1 concentrator I could have four serial\nports right there to be able to use.\n\n319\n00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,070\nAnd you'll see other options up here for\nadding in those different connections.\n\n320\n00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,060\nA lot of different choices and\nit does vary based on the router.\n\n321\n00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,780\nIf I go back to my 7200,\n\n322\n00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,760\nit's got a lot more options,\nbecause it's a bigger router.\n\n323\n00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,725\nSo when you go in here I can add a Fast\nEthernet or two Fast Ethernet jacks,\n\n324\n00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,670\na gigabit Ethernet jack.\n\n325\n00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,609\nAnd you'll see different ports,\nhere's the four serial ports,\n\n326\n00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:57,990\neight serial ports, we can go crazy,\nadd in a OC3 because, why not?\n\n327\n00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,630\nRight.\n\n328\n00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,730\nA lot of this is equipment that\nwe might not be able to afford or\n\n329\n00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,760\nmight not have access to in real life.\n\n330\n00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,338\nBut here is virtual,\nbuild out what you want right?\n\n331\n00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,034\nYou want to set up your own ISDN switch?\n\n332\n00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:11,858\nGreat, add in some of these 8T cards and\nyou'll be able to have\n\n333\n00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:16,710\nmany many serial ports, set up your own\nISDN switch and get to running, right?\n\n334\n00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,970\nMaybe you don't want to set up your\nown ISDN switch but you want to just\n\n335\n00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,020\nautomatically have one in place, well\nwe'll see a little bit later where there's\n\n336\n00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,920\nsome ISDN switches and stuff like that,\nthat are already defined that we can use.\n\n337\n00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,550\nBut you've got control you pick what\nyou want that system to have and\n\n338\n00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,012\nyou get it configured how you need it.\n\n339\n00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,510\nAll right, so for\nmy 7200 maybe I want a handful of\n\n340\n00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,150\nFast Ethernet jacks so I'll just\nadd in a couple of these 2FE cards.\n\n341\n00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,920\nThere we go.\n\n342\n00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,530\nSo now I've got six of these.\n\n343\n00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,980\nNotice this first one, this is what's\nbuilt into the router itself, and\n\n344\n00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,409\nthen I've added two more cards to get\nsix of these Fast Ethernet jacks.\n\n345\n00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:57,750\nAll right, now the cards themselves don't\n\n346\n00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,020\ndo us a heck of a lot of good until\nwe start to plug our cables in, so\n\n347\n00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,280\nthat's kind of the next part is we need\nto start cabling these systems together.\n\n348\n00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,640\nWhile you might be plugging your router\ndirectly into another router, or\n\n349\n00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,690\nyou might be plugging into switches.\n\n350\n00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,680\nAnd so that's kinda the next thing,\nis when you need to bring in switches and\n\n351\n00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,670\nget them in here.\n\n352\n00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,100\nBut I think I'll hold that off for\nanother segment.\n\n353\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,360\nAs far as getting our\ninitial router configured,\n\n354\n00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,960\nwe've kinda seen what we need to do.\n\n355\n00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,130\nConfigure your idle PC, configure your\nmemory, configure your cards, right?\n\n356\n00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,700\nChange that however you want.\n\n357\n00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,070\nOnce that's done,\nthe router's ready to rock.\n\n358\n00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,730\nYou can start it up, and it's ready to go.\n\n359\n00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,020\nTo start it you just right-click and\nhit Start.\n\n360\n00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,290\nAnd from there you can right-click and\nhit Console to connect\n\n361\n00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,140\nright to the console port of that router\nand start to work with it, right?\n\n362\n00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,810\nAfter you've assigned it an IP address and\n\n363\n00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,190\nall that then you can start\nremoting into it through Telnet or\n\n364\n00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,060\nSSH but when it's initially firing up,\nyou'll want to use this console port.\n\n365\n00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,440\nSo here it goes, firing up.\n\n366\n00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,280\nAnd we're in, right.\n\n367\n00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,970\nSo here we are,\nI can do a show IP interface brief.\n\n368\n00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,070\nAnd here's those network\njacks that I added in.\n\n369\n00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,640\nI've got the FE0/0 that was onboard.\n\n370\n00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,030\nI thought I had two onboard,\nbut I guess just one.\n\n371\n00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,580\nAnd then here's the first card I added and\nthe second card that I added.\n\n372\n00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,170\nSo I've got five Fast Ethernet ports\ncause of the cards that I chose, right?\n\n373\n00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,490\nYou can pick whatever you need.\n\n374\n00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,330\nI didn't do any serial ports,\nright, so I could add those in and\n\n375\n00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,660\nreally had some fun.\n\n376\n00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,140\nKeep in mind that it is\njust like a real router,\n\n377\n00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,090\nif the router is online I\ncan't add hardware to it.\n\n378\n00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,890\nSo if I go into it's configuration\nwhile the router is on and\n\n379\n00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,500\nyou start adjusting things it's not\ngoing to be very happy about that.\n\n380\n00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,717\nSo if I start to add a bunch of\nthese 8T cards in and hit OK well,\n\n381\n00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:44,769\nsee I'm getting some unable to add\nbinding messages and stuff like that.\n\n382\n00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,834\nAnd that's because\nthe router is actually on.\n\n383\n00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:51,338\nSo I need to power it off Just like\nin real life, and then go in here and\n\n384\n00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:53,410\nmodify it's configuration.\n\n385\n00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,300\nSo I'll go back here into my slots,\nit at least remembered it.\n\n386\n00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,110\nWe'll go ahead and say OK,\noh I may have really made it unhappy.\n\n387\n00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,000\nWell, we'll find out here in a second.\n\n388\n00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100\nI'm just gonna start it up and\nconnect back to it's console and\n\n389\n00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,900\nwe should see whether or\nnot it picked up those cards.\n\n390\n00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,200\nSo try not to modify the hardware while\nthe router is running that's the moral\n\n391\n00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,730\nof that story.\n\n392\n00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,870\nAll right, let's see if this shows up.\n\n393\n00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,520\nOh, it looks like it did.\n\n394\n00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,590\nSee how I have five\nFast Ethernet interfaces and\n\n395\n00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,979\n16 cereal ports that it's now picked up.\n\n396\n00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,380\nYou'll see a few warnings\nwhen you boot up,\n\n397\n00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,190\njust like on a normal router you'll see\nyour interfaces come up and come down.\n\n398\n00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,250\nBut there was also a warning\nup there about a crash dump.\n\n399\n00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,770\nAnd, let's see, where did it go?\n\n400\n00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,440\nSomewhere in here there was\na warning about a crash dump.\n\n401\n00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,050\nRight there, Crashinfo may not be\nrecovered at bootflash:crashinfo.\n\n402\n00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,100\nThe problem is it's trying to look at the\nstorage to see if there's a crash file.\n\n403\n00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,580\nBut the storage is emulated so\nit can't find it.\n\n404\n00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,570\nSo that's what that error is.\n\n405\n00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,590\nThat's what you'll normally see,\nis issues with those.\n\n406\n00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,770\nBut if I do a show ip interface brief now,\n\n407\n00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,770\nthere's all those serial\nports that I just added.\n\n408\n00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,310\nSo I got a nice, big chunk of serial\nconnectivity I can start to work with.\n\n409\n00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,870\nReally neat stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,030\nAll right, so\nthat's our initial router configuration.\n\n411\n00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,010\nStay tuned, we've got more videos\ncoming up as we cover switches and\n\n412\n00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,700\nthen cabling all this stuff together.\n\n413\n00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,500\nSo we'll get a chance to\nsee all that coming up.\n\n414\n00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,392\nStay tuned.\n\n415\n00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,434\nWe'll be back with more.\n\n416\n00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:17,470\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

GNS3.\n\n3\n00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,215\nNow GNS3's real power is\non the routing side, right.\n\n4\n00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:19,220\nSysco routers, Juniper routers,\nASAs, all that stuff.\n\n5\n00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,730\nIt's really amazing,\nyou get a lot of stuff.\n\n6\n00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,040\nReally doesn't do any kind\nof switch emulation, right?\n\n7\n00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,270\nDoesn't do switch platform.\n\n8\n00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,130\nIt's just not done,\n\n9\n00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,690\nand the main reason is switches have\na lot of proprietary hardware in them.\n\n10\n00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,280\nAs they are doing layer two\nswitching between ports,\n\n11\n00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,580\nthat just doesn't lend itself\nto being emulated very well.\n\n12\n00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,380\nI don't know of any products\nout there that do that.\n\n13\n00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,870\nOn G&S3, what they did is they\ncreated their own switches,\n\n14\n00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,410\nwhich we don't really mess with much.\n\n15\n00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,840\nWe drop them out into our topology, and\nwe apply a configuration, if needed.\n\n16\n00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,220\nIf all I need is a straight up layer\ntwo switch with nothing special,\n\n17\n00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,600\nI can go under my switching menu here,\nfind ethernet switch,\n\n18\n00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,330\ndrag it out here and drop it.\n\n19\n00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,680\nNow I've got a switch, and I can\nstart to plug my routers into it, and\n\n20\n00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,940\nPCs and so on, all right.\n\n21\n00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,210\nThe switch will grow as\nI plug things into it.\n\n22\n00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,650\nSo if I plug five things in,\nit will have five ports.\n\n23\n00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,810\nIf I plug ten things in it,\nthey'll have ten ports.\n\n24\n00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,260\nFor the most part,\nthat may be all you need.\n\n25\n00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,250\nYou throw the switch out, and\nyou never mess with it again.\n\n26\n00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,313\nThat's it, all right.\n\n27\n00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,666\nBut there are some advanced\nfeatures in there.\n\n28\n00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,250\nIf you right-click on the switch, you'll\nsee configure, and inside of configure\n\n29\n00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,930\nyou can pull up the switch configuration,\nand you can add the ports.\n\n30\n00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,140\nSee how mine started out with eight ports?\n\n31\n00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,700\nSo I can go and I can add more.\n\n32\n00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,570\nIf I wanted to get it set up with 12\nports from the very beginning, right,\n\n33\n00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,030\nI could come in here and\npick my ports, and start to add them.\n\n34\n00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,290\nThe other thing is, these ports are all\nset up to be in VLAN 1 as an access port.\n\n35\n00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,950\nSo it's just one big switch,\none big collision and\n\n36\n00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,640\nbroadcast domain, and that's it.\n\n37\n00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,220\nI'm sorry, it's multiple collision\ndomains, but one big broadcast domain.\n\n38\n00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,900\nAnd it's It's just there,\nyou plug your machines in and you're done.\n\n39\n00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,210\nBut if you're gonna be\nworking with trunking.\n\n40\n00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,530\nYou know, if you want to do router on\na stick, for example, where you have one\n\n41\n00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,570\nconnection running to the router, and\nyou want to break it up into VLANs.\n\n42\n00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,730\nWell, you need to tell the switch to\ncarry more than one VLAN on that port.\n\n43\n00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,480\nAnd the default configuration\ndoesn't do that.\n\n44\n00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,620\nSo you might wanna come in and\nchange the switch.\n\n45\n00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,500\nNow it doesn't really let you\nchange a port that already exists.\n\n46\n00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,330\nSo if we want to get rid of one of\nthese ports, you can click on it and\n\n47\n00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,240\nmake a change, but if you try and,\nhere if I change this port\n\n48\n00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,560\nFrom an access to an 802.1q trunk,\nand hit Add, there it goes.\n\n49\n00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,250\nIt updates it, and\nnow it's reflecting that it's 802.1q.\n\n50\n00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,190\nYou can go through and\ndo that for each of these,\n\n51\n00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,280\nto make them trunks, but sometimes it'll\nadd a new port down there at the end.\n\n52\n00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,100\nSo you gotta be aware of which port is\nshowing up, In this case it's this one.\n\n53\n00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,550\nSo if you want to modify an existing port,\nyou've gotta double click on it, so\n\n54\n00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,890\nthat this screen updates to\nreflect the new values, and\n\n55\n00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,920\nthen you can modify it, all right.\n\n56\n00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360\nSo if I want to have two\ntrunks from my routers,\n\n57\n00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,160\nI can modify those ports and\nnow I've got two 802.1Q trunks.\n\n58\n00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,930\nNow there's still a VLAN value,\nthat's gonna be the native VLAN.\n\n59\n00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,790\nThese guys both have\na native VLAN of VLAN1.\n\n60\n00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,490\nThat's exactly what I want right?\n\n61\n00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,330\nNormally.\n\n62\n00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,970\nBut in your labs, if you're gonna be\nusing a native VLAN of something else,\n\n63\n00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,210\nyou might need to come in and\nadjust that here.\n\n64\n00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,990\nSo maybe I want VLAN 10\nto be my native VLAN.\n\n65\n00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,230\nSo I can modify that here.\n\n66\n00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,758\nSo now these are 802.1Q trunks,\nwith a native VLAN of VLAN 10.\n\n67\n00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:31,420\nMy other ports,I might want them to be on\ndifferent vlans too, but not be trunks.\n\n68\n00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,700\nSo I might say that, maybe these\nother ports here are on VLAN ten.\n\n69\n00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,050\nSo I'll go and pump them over to VLAN ten,\n\n70\n00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,770\nbut the other guys maybe I\nwant them to be on VLAN two.\n\n71\n00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,240\nSo I can come in and I can change that.\n\n72\n00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,750\nAnd set the VLAN information.\n\n73\n00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,520\nNow we're not really learning\nmuch about Sysco here,\n\n74\n00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,750\nbecause well we're not using\nthe Sysco iOS or anything.\n\n75\n00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,400\nBut at least we have that functionality.\n\n76\n00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120\nBelieve me it's better than nothing.\n\n77\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,320\nWhat we used to have was, you'd have to\nbring up a router with one of those 16\n\n78\n00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,550\nport switch cards in it, and\ndo this stuff inside of the router.\n\n79\n00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,630\nWhich works, but even that is not like\na traditional Sysco switch, so it\n\n80\n00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,160\ndoesn't give you a proper representation\nof what's on the exam for CCNA and CCNP.\n\n81\n00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,090\nIt's just not a good solution.\n\n82\n00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,530\nSo here at least we get\na switch that works.\n\n83\n00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,140\nWe can provide the functionality we need.\n\n84\n00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,560\nNow we can plug our routers in,\nand they can start to work.\n\n85\n00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,190\nAll right?\n\n86\n00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,750\nNow I'm gonna change this\nnative VLAN back to VLAN1.\n\n87\n00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,080\nI don't like to use a different\nnative VLAN if I don't have to.\n\n88\n00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600\nSo I'll just put that back\nto the way it was, but\n\n89\n00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,980\nI'll leave these access ports\non VLAN10 and VLAN2, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,585\nNow we're where we plug\nin our workstations,\n\n91\n00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:44,500\nwe'll need to be aware of which\nports they get plugged into to.\n\n92\n00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,100\nYou don't have to.\n\n93\n00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,720\nYou can plug them in and\nhave it use the first available.\n\n94\n00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,900\nBut since our ports now have\ndifferent configurations,\n\n95\n00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,240\nwe'll want to be very particular\nabout what we're plugging in to.\n\n96\n00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,450\nI've got an eight port switch.\n\n97\n00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,890\nWhat happens if I plug\na ninth machine into it?\n\n98\n00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,330\nIt'll add a ninth port,\nwhich will be an access port on VLAN one.\n\n99\n00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,880\nThat's the default configuration for\na switch inside of GNS3.\n\n100\n00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,820\nYou've got some other options like a hub.\n\n101\n00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,710\nIf you want to bring a hub in you can.\n\n102\n00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,230\nThe hub obviously doesn't have\nas many options as a switch,\n\n103\n00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,690\nbecause well it's a hub.\n\n104\n00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,810\nIt doesn't look at your data.\n\n105\n00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,040\nWe've got ATM bridges and switches,\n\n106\n00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,250\nif you want to learn about\nasynchronous transfer mode.\n\n107\n00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,270\nIt's not really on any\nof the exams anymore, so\n\n108\n00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,180\nmost people don't worry about that one.\n\n109\n00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,760\nFrame relay though.\n\n110\n00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,610\nIf you wanna set up frame relay on your\nnetwork, you could throw in a router with\n\n111\n00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,760\na bunch of serial ports on it, and\nconfigure it to be a frame relay switch.\n\n112\n00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,180\nYou can certainly do that.\n\n113\n00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,940\nOr, you could just use\nthis guy right here.\n\n114\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,850\nBring it out, and you'll see here\nwhere we can define our DLCI mappings.\n\n115\n00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,930\nSo we can create all the mappings that\nthe telephone company would normally do,\n\n116\n00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,280\nand configure our routers to use it.\n\n117\n00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,306\nSo I might have port one,\n\n118\n00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:55,720\nwith a DLCI of 101 connected to port two,\nwith a DLCI of 202.\n\n119\n00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,560\nAnd then I can come in and\nstart mapping other ones that I want.\n\n120\n00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,127\nI might have port one with\na DLCI 103 connecting\n\n121\n00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:10,420\nwith port three, with a DLCI of 303.\n\n122\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,020\nRight?\n\n123\n00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,310\nAnd then continuing on.\n\n124\n00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,260\nSo I'm setting up router one\nto basically be like my hub.\n\n125\n00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,910\nAnd all of these other\nsites to be my spokes.\n\n126\n00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:24,720\nSo I can go through and enter in all the\nDLCI information that relates to those.\n\n127\n00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080\nBuilding it up here.\n\n128\n00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,490\nYou can do it on the router if you want,\nor you can do it right here.\n\n129\n00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,600\nIt's just kind of a canned\nframe relay switch.\n\n130\n00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,770\nAlright, the last one here\nis EtherSwitch router,\n\n131\n00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,360\nand that would be a layer three switch.\n\n132\n00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960\nIf we drag that one and throw it out here,\nthis one's a little bit different than\n\n133\n00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,370\nthe other ones,\nbecause it has routing built into it.\n\n134\n00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,970\nIt's a little more complex.\n\n135\n00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,030\nIf we pull up its configuration,\n\n136\n00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,320\nyou'll see that we've got options that\nbasically look like a router, right.\n\n137\n00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,340\nWe see our mid plane and MPE, our memory,\n\n138\n00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,630\nour slots where we pick how much stuff\nwe've got, and some advanced settings.\n\n139\n00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,980\nBut for the most part it's like a actual\nrouter, and if you start it up.\n\n140\n00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,230\nYou can actually console into this one.\n\n141\n00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,650\nAnd it'll come up, and\nyou'll see configuration in here that is,\n\n142\n00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,340\nbased in iOS CSO Firehop Sysco\n3725 router,\n\n143\n00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,140\nit's really just a 3725 router with\na 16 port switch card stuck in it.\n\n144\n00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,070\nSo it looks like a switch,\nbut it is a router.\n\n145\n00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,480\nThat's all its doing right\nthere to provide that.\n\n146\n00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,210\nAnd if I do a show ip interface brief,\n\n147\n00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,020\nthere's those 16 ports all\nshowing up right there.\n\n148\n00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,520\nAnd so their fast ethernet 1/0-15,\nand I've got a vLAN interface.\n\n149\n00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280\nSo, now I'm kinda configuring this\nmore like in a Sysco environment.\n\n150\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,900\nBut it is a router, not a switch, and so\n\n151\n00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,920\nthere's some things that just\ndon't work right, like VTP, and\n\n152\n00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,020\na lot of the spanning tree functionality\njust doesn't work right on this system.\n\n153\n00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,500\nSo you get some of the Sysco\nfunctionality but not all.\n\n154\n00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,800\nI typically don't use this,\n\n155\n00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,210\njust cuz I know it's somewhat\ninconsistent, but it is there.\n\n156\n00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,010\nIt's a resource available for you.\n\n157\n00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,825\n[SOUND] All right well,\nonce you get your switches out here,\n\n158\n00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:14,750\nand everything's kind of arranged\nthe way that you want it.\n\n159\n00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,220\nTrying to get rid of these extra devices.\n\n160\n00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,000\nNow, we've got our equipment.\n\n161\n00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,600\nWe just need to cable it up and\nget it running, all right?\n\n162\n00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,800\nSo, we'll get a chance to see\ncabling in the next video.\n\n163\n00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280\nBe sure to stay tuned for that one.\n\n164\n00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,780\nIt's coming up next.\n\n165\n00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,585\nNext.\n\n166\n00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:34,224\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:07,487\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:10,162\nSo you've seen how to add routers and\nswitches and\n\n3\n00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:12,740\nother equipment into your topology.\n\n4\n00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,320\nNow, we need to cable it together so\nwe can actually use this stuff.\n\n5\n00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,030\nSo that's our next step is\ngetting things cabled together.\n\n6\n00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,098\nFortunately, it really couldn't be\nany easier here inside of GNS3.\n\n7\n00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,090\nWhen we wanna cable something,\n\n8\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,430\nwe have this little cable wizard\ntype option that we can use.\n\n9\n00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:27,950\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n10\n00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,570\nLet me show you how it works.\n\n11\n00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,760\nOn the left side of the screen,\nyou'll see an icon here.\n\n12\n00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,780\nIt's supposed to look like an RJ45\njack and a cat 5 cable, or whatever.\n\n13\n00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,080\nSo you'll see that button there.\n\n14\n00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,310\nThis is your generic cable button.\n\n15\n00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,360\nIt will let you run any type of cable that\nyou want, be it Fast Ethernet or Gigabit.\n\n16\n00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,980\nIf you want it to be serial,\nwhatever, right?\n\n17\n00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,570\nWhat it does is when you go to connect,\n\n18\n00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,860\nit's gonna ask you what port\nyou're plugging into, and it will\n\n19\n00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,270\nchoose the appropriate cable type based on\nthe port that you've selected, all right?\n\n20\n00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,711\nSo let's say I wanna take Router 1 and\n\n21\n00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,153\nplug its first interface into Switch 1,\nall right?\n\n22\n00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:10,070\nWell I can click on Router 1 and\nI'll get a list of all of my ports.\n\n23\n00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,538\nAnd on this router, I've got two\nFast Ethernet ports, fa0/0 and\n\n24\n00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:18,100\n0/1, and\nthen I've got serial 1/0 through 3.\n\n25\n00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,865\nI've got a four port\nserial card in this one.\n\n26\n00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:26,620\nI'm gonna choose fa0/0, and now it's just\nasking me where I wanna plug it into.\n\n27\n00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,040\nAnd so I'll go down here to the switch and\n\n28\n00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,213\nclick, and that's gonna let me pick\nwhich port I'll plug into on the switch.\n\n29\n00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:32,910\nAnd I'll pick Port 1, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,920\nNow because this is my first connection,\n\n31\n00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,300\nit's now realizing that I'm gonna have\nthese devices networked together.\n\n32\n00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,990\nAnd in Windows, in order to do that,\nwe need to clear the Windows firewall.\n\n33\n00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,912\nSo it's asking if we can add\nthat rule to the firewall.\n\n34\n00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:49,920\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo it, and hit allow access.\n\n35\n00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,550\nNow the cable is there, the router is on,\nso the link goes green.\n\n36\n00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,160\nI've got link lights.\n\n37\n00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,900\nThat's what these little circles\nare right here are my link lights,\n\n38\n00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,210\nto let me know that I've got a connection.\n\n39\n00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,030\nI could come over here to Router 2 and\nplug it in.\n\n40\n00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,970\nI'll do it f0/0 and\nplug that into the switch on Port 2.\n\n41\n00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,730\nAnd now there they go, right?\n\n42\n00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,580\nOff and ready to go.\n\n43\n00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,710\nWhen you're done running those cables\nyou just click the button over\n\n44\n00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,670\nhere on the left screen again,\nand now you're ready to work.\n\n45\n00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,640\nNow remember when I plug those guys in,\nI plug them into Ports 1 and 2.\n\n46\n00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,622\nAnd if I double click on my switch,\nremember how I set Port 1 and\n\n47\n00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:24,720\n2 to be trunks.\n\n48\n00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,140\nI need to remember that so that I can\ngo and set up router on a stick or\n\n49\n00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700\nwhatever it is that I wanna do.\n\n50\n00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,290\nBut otherwise,\n\n51\n00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,440\nthey're plugged in, and they're gonna be\non VLAN1 if they don't build up a trunk.\n\n52\n00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,330\nAnd they should be able to see each\nother right through that switch.\n\n53\n00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,480\nI can then go ahead and plug other\ndevices in and start to grow my network.\n\n54\n00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,540\nNow, just for kicks I threw in\na frame relay switch up here.\n\n55\n00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,480\nAnd if I wanna do serial connections\nto that, I can come over here and\n\n56\n00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,440\nclick my cable button again.\n\n57\n00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,510\nAnd on Router 1 this time I'll just\npick one of my serial connections.\n\n58\n00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,370\nI'll do serial 1/0.\n\n59\n00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,010\nAnd I can run that up here\nto my frame relay switch,\n\n60\n00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,280\nwhere I'll plug it into Port 1.\n\n61\n00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,397\nAnd I'll do the same thing\nover here on Router 2.\n\n62\n00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:06,590\nI'll take its serial 1/0 and\nplug it into Port 2, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,790\nI could also run directly\nbetween the routers.\n\n64\n00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,230\nI'll take serial 1/3 and\n\n65\n00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,780\nrun it over to Router 2 on serial 1/3 and\nthere we go, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,970\nSo now I've started to\nbuild out that topology,\n\n67\n00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,440\nI can see what connections are linked,\nand I can start to experiment and learn.\n\n68\n00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,410\nYou can run multiple connections too.\n\n69\n00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,640\nYou might be testing redundancy.\n\n70\n00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,160\nSo I might wanna run another\nconnection between these two routers.\n\n71\n00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,800\nI'll connect serial 1/2 over to Router 2,\nserial 1/2.\n\n72\n00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,740\nWhen you do that it'll\nstack the cables together.\n\n73\n00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,220\nSo now I can see I've got redundant\nlinks between that router.\n\n74\n00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,364\nReally cool if you're trying to do things\nlike link aggregation, or if you're\n\n75\n00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:51,690\ntrying to see equal cost load balancing\ninside of EIGRP, or something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,547\nReally nice to have those\nmultiple links to test with.\n\n77\n00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:59,480\nPPP/Multilink, that's another one where\nyou need two serial links to do it.\n\n78\n00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,540\nAny of those technologies\nyou'll run more than one link.\n\n79\n00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,980\nSo, it's really just limited to you and\nthe connections that you wanna run.\n\n80\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,410\nYou cable it up, and then you're done.\n\n81\n00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,190\nNow the cables actually do have\na life of their own in GNS3.\n\n82\n00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,809\nWhen we start to work with our equipment,\n\n83\n00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,270\nyou can float over these to\nget the information about it.\n\n84\n00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,540\nIt'll tell you the two end\npoints on that cable, right?\n\n85\n00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,720\nRouter 2, Router 1, whatever.\n\n86\n00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,025\nAnd later on we'll see where you can right\nclick on these and choose start capturing.\n\n87\n00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,430\nAnd that'll fire up Wireshark,\n\n88\n00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,580\nand allow us to capture all\nthe traffic crossing that cable.\n\n89\n00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,090\nAnd that's really cool if you\nwanna see the packets and\n\n90\n00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,305\ncommunications going on\nbetween those routers.\n\n91\n00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:39,290\nThere's communications going on right now.\n\n92\n00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,220\nThose serial links come up,\nCisco routers run CDP by default,\n\n93\n00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,210\nCisco Discovery Protocol, so\nthose packets should be passing along.\n\n94\n00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,090\nAlthough, just because the link is up\ndoesn't mean the interface is active.\n\n95\n00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,960\nCisco routers shut their\nports down by default.\n\n96\n00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,530\nSo these ports are probably\nstill administratively shutdown.\n\n97\n00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,720\nI guess we could see that real quick if we\nfired one end up and looked at it here.\n\n98\n00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,519\nAnd we can see their status.\n\n99\n00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,840\nYeah, they're all\nadministratively shut down.\n\n100\n00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,900\nBut their links should be up, and so\n\n101\n00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,090\nwe could get into our configuration and\ncan I do a range command on a router?\n\n102\n00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,660\nSure can, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,610\nAnd I'll just issue some no shutdown\ncommands to bring those up.\n\n104\n00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,565\nAnd let me remember what\nmy serial interfaces are.\n\n105\n00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:37,635\n1/0 through 3 I guess would\nmake it a little bit happier.\n\n106\n00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:44,355\nThat range command is\nalways a sensitive one.\n\n107\n00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,975\nSometimes it'll take your input,\nsometimes it won't.\n\n108\n00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,185\nAll right, well,\nI'll just do this by hand.\n\n109\n00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:51,545\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n110\n00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:54,805\nBut we'll start bringing these up, and\nwhat we'll see is that we should be\n\n111\n00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:58,980\ngetting link up messages, because,\nwell, the links are up, right?\n\n112\n00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,780\nWe've got link lights.\n\n113\n00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,920\nThe other side is maybe or\nmaybe not configured, but\n\n114\n00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,360\nthose links are coming up, they're happy.\n\n115\n00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,180\nNow we're ready to work.\n\n116\n00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820\nNow we can get into our routers and\nreally start to do things,\n\n117\n00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,270\nstart to experiment around, and\nsee how things are going, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,920\nOne little word of advice to mention here.\n\n119\n00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,590\nThese ethernet ports,\nsee how like my fa0/1?\n\n120\n00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,870\nI just turned it on and\nit's showing as up up, right?\n\n121\n00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,750\nBut if I go back here and look,\nmy fa0/1, what is it plugged into?\n\n122\n00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,510\nWell, I can't really tell right here.\n\n123\n00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,310\nOn the right side,\nI can go to Router 1 and\n\n124\n00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,020\nexpand it and\nit'll tell me what's plugged in.\n\n125\n00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,115\nNotice fa0/1 is not on the list.\n\n126\n00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:44,179\n0/0 was run to a switch, s1/0, s1/2, s1/3.\n\n127\n00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:48,881\nBut fa0/1 is not in the list.\n\n128\n00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:52,708\nHow can it be up with a link light\nif it's not even in the list?\n\n129\n00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:57,510\nWell, in GNS3 when you bring an interface\nup, it'll always show a link light.\n\n130\n00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,500\nSo you'll always have Layer 1 and\nLayer 2 registering as being connected,\n\n131\n00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,010\neven though you're not necessarily\nable to communicate across that line.\n\n132\n00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,570\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n133\n00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,700\nIf you shut the interface down,\n\n134\n00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,870\nit will go down, but the link will\nalways show up inside of the router.\n\n135\n00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,460\nIt's kind of one of\nthe limitations that we have.\n\n136\n00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,290\nAll right, but other than that,\nthat's the cabling.\n\n137\n00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,160\nYou can always change\nit after the fact too.\n\n138\n00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,420\nIf you hover over one of the link lights,\n\n139\n00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,200\nyou can hold your mouse button down and\nclick to move the link.\n\n140\n00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,280\nActually it's not letting me move that\none, probably cuz the router's on.\n\n141\n00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,840\nYou can always right click on it and\ndelete it too, and remove that cable and\n\n142\n00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,630\nthen rerun it.\n\n143\n00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,150\nAnd so maybe I wanna plug it\ninto a different port this time.\n\n144\n00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,360\nAnd so I can choose that\ndifferent port and run it.\n\n145\n00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280\nSo a lot of this stuff can be changed,\nre-mapped, moved around however you need.\n\n146\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,829\nReally cool stuff.\n\n147\n00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,980\nAll right, well that's probably enough\non cabling, so we'll wrap it up there.\n\n148\n00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,770\nWe've got more videos coming on how to\nwork with GNS3, so stay tuned for those.\n\n149\n00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,954\nI hope you guys enjoyed this one.\n\n150\n00:07:53,954 --> 00:08:01,439\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,935\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:10,708\nSo now you've built your topology,\nyou've got your routers out,\n\n3\n00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,091\nyou've got your switches out,\nand all that's in place,\n\n4\n00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,781\nyou've started them up and\nyou're ready to get to work, right.\n\n5\n00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,890\nSo, how do we connect into\nthese devices to work with it?\n\n6\n00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,820\nI know I've already showed you one way in\nan earlier video which is connecting to\n\n7\n00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,890\nthe console of the device.\n\n8\n00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,320\nAnd for our initial setup that's\nnormally what we're going to do.\n\n9\n00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,450\nThe easiest way to that is like this.\n\n10\n00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,210\nYou just right click on the device you\nwant to manage and you choose Console.\n\n11\n00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,660\nWhen you choose that it'll\nopen up the console port.\n\n12\n00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,130\nJust opening up a putty window.\n\n13\n00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,160\nAnd here I am ready to work\nwith that particular system.\n\n14\n00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,110\nSo there we go exciting right?\n\n15\n00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,950\nNow, if you just fired up\neight different routers and\n\n16\n00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,110\nyou want to connect to all eight\nconsole ports, you can actually\n\n17\n00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,950\nuse the big console button up here in your\ntask bar or whatever we want to call that.\n\n18\n00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,930\nWhen you choose that, its got the option\nto console connect to all devices and\n\n19\n00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,350\nthat'll fire up a console window not\njust to router one, but to router two.\n\n20\n00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,870\nSee how it's just cascading\nthem on my screen.\n\n21\n00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,170\nSo I've got each of them\navailable right here.\n\n22\n00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,910\nA quick and\neasy way to whip open those consoles.\n\n23\n00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,230\nBe aware, that just like a real console\nport, only one person can be connected at\n\n24\n00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,420\na time, so you can't open more than one\nconsole connection to the same router.\n\n25\n00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420\nIt won't let you do that.\n\n26\n00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220\nThe second one just won't connect.\n\n27\n00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,330\nSo if I try and console in here,\nthere's my valid console window.\n\n28\n00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,920\nI'll just move it to the background.\n\n29\n00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,090\nAnd if I try and console in again, what\nwe'll get is some screen interruption.\n\n30\n00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,220\nSee that little corruption that we got?\n\n31\n00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,940\nAnd that's us jumping into\nan existing session and\n\n32\n00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,350\neffectively kicking out the old one.\n\n33\n00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,650\nSo you've gotta be careful with that.\n\n34\n00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,460\nThe two will conflict with each other.\n\n35\n00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,760\nJust keep one console\nconnection open per device.\n\n36\n00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,500\nBut you can have ten console windows\nopen at ten different devices.\n\n37\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,310\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n38\n00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,940\nNow, there is another neat thing.\n\n39\n00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,990\nWhat if I want to run\nGNS3 on one computer, but\n\n40\n00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,740\nI wanna use a different\ncomputer to work from.\n\n41\n00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,540\nSo for example, maybe I've got a desktop\nmachine at home that's really powerful and\n\n42\n00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,300\nI wanna run my routers from there.\n\n43\n00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,870\nBut then I wanna sit in\nthe living room on my laptop and\n\n44\n00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,330\nactually work with this stuff.\n\n45\n00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,570\nMy laptop might not be powerful\nenough to run all the different\n\n46\n00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,750\nrouters that I've got.\n\n47\n00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,900\nWell, you can remotely connect\ninto these routers also.\n\n48\n00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,340\nIf you right click on one of the routers\nyou'll see the option in here\n\n49\n00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,060\nchange console port.\n\n50\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,620\nEvery one of these has their console\nmapped to a TCP port number.\n\n51\n00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,740\nAnd if you look at it.\n\n52\n00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,060\nI must restart, oh it's just a warning\nyou have to restart if you change it.\n\n53\n00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,720\nBut I can see that router one has\na console port number of 2101.\n\n54\n00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,390\nAll right.\n\n55\n00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,280\nSo what I can do is,\nassuming this is open in my firewall, so\n\n56\n00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,220\nI'd want to go into Windows Firewall and\nopen up port 2101,\n\n57\n00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,700\nbut then I can go to any other\nmachine on my internal network.\n\n58\n00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,780\nAnd if I telnet to this computer on\nport 2101, I'll see that console right.\n\n59\n00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,820\nLet me show you that.\n\n60\n00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,530\nIf I go and\n\n61\n00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,220\nI'm just going to close this other console\nwindow because I don't want conflicts.\n\n62\n00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,800\nWe're conflict free here,\nI think that's the Starbucks motto.\n\n63\n00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,280\nSo I'm just gonna fire up a command prompt\nhere, and I'm gonna do Telnet 127.0.0.1,\n\n64\n00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,900\nconnecting to myself, on port 2101.\n\n65\n00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,870\nWhen I do that, there I am.\n\n66\n00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,600\nI'm connected to that router and I can\nstart to work with it and everything.\n\n67\n00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,280\nI lost my cool amber screen\nthat I had in putty.\n\n68\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,360\nBut here am I am and\nI can work with this system.\n\n69\n00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,050\nSo you can run GNS three on one computer\nbut actually work from another one.\n\n70\n00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,740\nAnd still access the consoles, right.\n\n71\n00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,360\nSo I can get in here I can\nwork with the system and\n\n72\n00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,570\nit's just like I'm plugged\ndirectly into the console.\n\n73\n00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,010\nSee all my interfaces are shut down but\n\n74\n00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,740\nI'm still in because I'm\non the console port.\n\n75\n00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,800\nAnd I used the command prompt\nTelnet to get there but\n\n76\n00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,900\nyou could have used PuTTY, right?\n\n77\n00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,540\nSo I could have done\nthe same thing here and\n\n78\n00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,140\njust pointed to my host, told it I was\ndoing Telnet, and change that port number.\n\n79\n00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,420\nThe other router is probably\n2102 if I had to guess.\n\n80\n00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,030\nAnd there it is.\n\n81\n00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,820\nSee in PuTTY, I've got my color change so\n\n82\n00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,200\nit shows up at your end\nconnected to router two.\n\n83\n00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,690\nAnd it shows my connection\nright there on C2Y.\n\n84\n00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,930\nI'm consoled in and I'm working with it.\n\n85\n00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,910\nSo a really cool thing to do there and\nget connected.\n\n86\n00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,990\nNow it does use Telnet,\nwhich is not secure.\n\n87\n00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,540\nBut these routers should never be in\na production environment anyway, so\n\n88\n00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,010\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n89\n00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,940\nThis is for lab and test,\nTelnet's more than adequate.\n\n90\n00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,720\nIf you do SSH, well now you've\ngotta encrypt and decrypt traffic,\n\n91\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,630\nwhich is gonna increase the CPU\nloads on these routers.\n\n92\n00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,600\nThe more routers you have, the more of\na burden that places on your system.\n\n93\n00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,540\nSo just be aware,\nfrom a performance standpoint,\n\n94\n00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,787\nthat you don't wanna go crazy with\nthings like encryption on these.\n\n95\n00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:55,160\nNow, what if I wanna use\nsomething like the Cisco SDM,\n\n96\n00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,920\nthe Security and Device Manager, the\ngraphical user interface for the router?\n\n97\n00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,840\nWell, normally on a router, what you\nwould do is you would copy the SDM onto\n\n98\n00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,410\nthe Flash of the router, and then you can\nbrowse through the router's web interface.\n\n99\n00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,470\nOr the router's already got\na web interface, doesn't it.\n\n100\n00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,820\nI could just browse it and\nuse that from my PC.\n\n101\n00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,350\nWell, this network that we've\njust created is isolated.\n\n102\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,690\nIt's inside of GNS3 and that's it.\n\n103\n00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,140\nThere's no way for my desktop\ncomputer to connect to that router.\n\n104\n00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,200\nFor example, if I,\nlet me fire up my command prompt again.\n\n105\n00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,290\nMy IP address for\nmy system is 10.1.230.243.\n\n106\n00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,110\nRight, that's my IP address.\n\n107\n00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,060\nAnd if I take this router and\nlet me just connect to it's console here.\n\n108\n00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,430\nAnd connect to it's interface,\nand I'll give\n\n109\n00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,220\nit an IP address of 10.1.230.244, so\nit's just the IP right after mine.\n\n110\n00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,150\nI show that interface is up.\n\n111\n00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,420\nAnd I've got that IP address.\n\n112\n00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,180\nBut if I try and ping my laptop,\nit's gonna fail.\n\n113\n00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,250\nAnd that's because GNS3 creates its\nown isolated, separate environment.\n\n114\n00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,460\nThat console port is the exception.\n\n115\n00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,150\nIt's mapped that console port to\na port number on our own machine, and\n\n116\n00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,900\nthat's why we're able to get it back.\n\n117\n00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,290\nBut we're not able to get to the network\ninterfaces through that port number,\n\n118\n00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,110\njust the console.\n\n119\n00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,400\nSo, what if I actually do\nwanna get to the router?\n\n120\n00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,750\nWhat if I wanna be able to fire up\na web browser and hit the router?\n\n121\n00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,330\nWhat we can do is we can create\na private network inside of a GNS3\n\n122\n00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,420\nthat's connected to a virtual\ninterface on our computer.\n\n123\n00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,420\nIt's a little bit complex, not the easiest\nthing to do, but it's pretty neat and\n\n124\n00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,180\nit does open up a whole new\nrealm of possibilities.\n\n125\n00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,310\nYou could run a TFTP server\non your workstation, and\n\n126\n00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,140\ncopy your configs back and forth.\n\n127\n00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,630\nYou could bring up a RADIUS server for\ndoing authentication and\n\n128\n00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,470\nhave the routers use that for\nauthentication.\n\n129\n00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,600\nThere's a lot of labs\nthat open themselves up\n\n130\n00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,350\nas soon as you connect your own\nPC into that virtual environment.\n\n131\n00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,720\nAll right, now I say PC.\n\n132\n00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,760\nIt's the same thing under Linux or Mac OS.\n\n133\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,080\nWe just need to get it attached\nto a virtual interface.\n\n134\n00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,240\nOn the Windows side the easiest way to\ndo that is with a loopback adapter.\n\n135\n00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,810\nIf you're on a Linux machine or\n\n136\n00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,720\na Mac OS machine,\nyou already have a loopback adapter.\n\n137\n00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,440\nThey put one in.\n\n138\n00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,890\nIt's part of the The Unix definitions,\nthat they have that.\n\n139\n00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,130\nIn Windows, we don't.\n\n140\n00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,720\nSo I need to add one in to\nbe able to make use of it.\n\n141\n00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,931\nThe other thing is, I'm gonna want that\nloopback adapter to show up in GNS3.\n\n142\n00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:40,960\nGNS3 will not recognize\nthe loopback adapter in Windows\n\n143\n00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,810\nunless you're running\nit as an administrator.\n\n144\n00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,520\nI didn't run this as an administrator.\n\n145\n00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,090\nSo if I want to see these routers\nI'm gonna need to relaunch GNS3 and\n\n146\n00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,010\nrun it as an administrator.\n\n147\n00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,600\nSo I'm just going to stop it and\nshut it down here.\n\n148\n00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,028\nSo I'm closing GNS3.\n\n149\n00:07:57,028 --> 00:08:02,109\nI guess I could save my topology so\nI don't have to redo it.\n\n150\n00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:04,290\nSo, we'll just call it my GNS3 Lab.\n\n151\n00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,130\nAll right, and\n\n152\n00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,860\nwhat I'll do is go through the process\nof adding in a loopback adapter.\n\n153\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,710\nIn Windows,\nwe need to go into our Device Manager, so\n\n154\n00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,960\nI'm gonna get into my Device Manager here.\n\n155\n00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,510\nWe're going to add in\na virtual network adapter.\n\n156\n00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,410\nSo if I go under Device Manager,\nI see all this real stuff, so\n\n157\n00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,910\nlike I see my real network adapters and\nso on.\n\n158\n00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,310\nI need to add in a fake network adapter,\nso\n\n159\n00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,320\nI'm going to right-click on my work\nstation and choose Add Legacy Hardware.\n\n160\n00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,320\nIf I hit Scan, it's not going to find it,\nit doesn't exist, I need to add it in.\n\n161\n00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,730\nSo I'm gonna add some legacy hardware.\n\n162\n00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,920\nAnd in the wizard here,\nI don't want it to search for\n\n163\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,070\nit cuz it's not going to find it.\n\n164\n00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,485\nI'm need to tell it, I'm gonna install\nhardware that I manually select,\n\n165\n00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,696\nI'm gonna install a network adapter so\nI'll pick that from the list.\n\n166\n00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,460\nAnd then it's gonna ask me to pick\nwhat kind of network adapter.\n\n167\n00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,420\nWell, in the list, you can find Microsoft.\n\n168\n00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,540\nMicrosoft doesn't actually make network\nadapters so when you click on Microsoft,\n\n169\n00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,830\nall of this stuff here\nwill be virtual adapters.\n\n170\n00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,210\nAnd if you browse around in here,\nsomewhere, you'll find the loopback one,\n\n171\n00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,825\nthey changed the name, there it is.\n\n172\n00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:17,200\nMicrosoftkm-testloopback adapter.\n\n173\n00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,430\nThere's a kernel mode test adapter and\nit's a loopback.\n\n174\n00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,830\nSo that's what I'm going to add.\n\n175\n00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,820\nLoopback adapters are fake adapters\nthat just point right back to us.\n\n176\n00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,320\nSo I'll choose that, and there we go.\n\n177\n00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,260\nAnd it's gonna add that one in.\n\n178\n00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,400\nOnce I've got it,\n\n179\n00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,450\nI can now use that loopback adapter\nto get it connected inside of GNS3.\n\n180\n00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,270\nNow that I've got it,\nI'm going to go into my Network and\n\n181\n00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,030\nSharing Center and\ninto Change Adapter Settings.\n\n182\n00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,617\nAnd I'm gonna find that\nloopback right there.\n\n183\n00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:51,359\nSo I'm gonna call that my GNS3 network.\n\n184\n00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,930\nSo I'm just renaming it, so\nI can remember why I made it.\n\n185\n00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,340\nI know that's my loopback cuz in this\ndescription here it says Microsoft KM test\n\n186\n00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,020\nloopback adapter.\n\n187\n00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,140\nAnd then I'll pull up it's properties,\nand I'm gonna give it an IP address.\n\n188\n00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,221\nSo I need to figure out what an IP address\nI want to use, I can use whatever I want,\n\n189\n00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,621\nreally, I'll use the 192.168 network\ncuz a lot of people are used to that.\n\n190\n00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:21,966\nAnd I'll make my work station .100 and\ngive it a subnet mask,\n\n191\n00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:24,977\na default gateway,\nif you want one, or DNS.\n\n192\n00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:27,328\nI'm going to leave those blank, right?\n\n193\n00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:31,440\nFor the 192.168.0 network,\nyes I want to go out this adapter.\n\n194\n00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,950\nBut for everything else,\nI want to go out my real adapter.\n\n195\n00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,580\nIf I put a default gateway here,\nthe loopback might\n\n196\n00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,420\noverride the other adapters and\nI'll lose my internet connection.\n\n197\n00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,490\nI don't want that.\n\n198\n00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,287\nI'll leave those blank and just put in IP.\n\n199\n00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:52,656\nSo now, I've got a loopback adapter and\nit's connected to the 192.168.0 network.\n\n200\n00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:56,290\nNow I need GNS3 to recognize that.\n\n201\n00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,890\nIn GNS3, what I need to do,\nis I need to run it as an administrator.\n\n202\n00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,450\nYou can right-click on it and\nchoose Run as Administrator.\n\n203\n00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,360\nFor me, I always want to run it\nas an administrator though so\n\n204\n00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960\nI modify the shortcut.\n\n205\n00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,930\nIf you go to the Properties\nof the shortcut,\n\n206\n00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,530\nyou'll see your Compatibility tab.\n\n207\n00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,010\nAnd under Compatibility, you can choose\nRun this program as an administrator,\n\n208\n00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,650\nthat way you don't have to\nremember in the future.\n\n209\n00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,040\nIn the future, you can just run it and\n\n210\n00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,360\nit will automatically\nrun as an administrator.\n\n211\n00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,150\nSo I'll say OK to that and run it.\n\n212\n00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,810\nNow, you guys aren't gonna see it but\n\n213\n00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,210\nas soon as I run it I'm gonna get\na user access control prompt.\n\n214\n00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,380\nMy screen sharing program won't show that.\n\n215\n00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,940\nAnd so, I'm just gonna say yes.\n\n216\n00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,300\nThat's it running as an administrator.\n\n217\n00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,160\nThat's gonna let it see the loopbacks.\n\n218\n00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360\nIf you don't run it as administrator,\nit won't even see the loopback adapter.\n\n219\n00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,390\nAll right, let me just close their ad.\n\n220\n00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,500\nAll right.\nAnd it's offering to create a new project.\n\n221\n00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,940\nI'm gonna open that project\nthat I made just a moment ago.\n\n222\n00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,740\nSo there it is.\n\n223\n00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,580\nWe'll open that up.\n\n224\n00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260\nAll right, here's my topology.\n\n225\n00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,860\nWhat I wanna do, is I wanna connect\nthese routers to my loopback adapter.\n\n226\n00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,730\nNow I can't just do that directly.\n\n227\n00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,570\nI need to bring in a network.\n\n228\n00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,490\nOn the left side here, you'll see some of\nthe different things we can bring in like\n\n229\n00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,460\na router, a switch,\nyou'll see a PC and so on.\n\n230\n00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,030\nUnder that PC, you've got Cloud.\n\n231\n00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,930\nWe can create a virtual network.\n\n232\n00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,910\nAnd I'm gonna drag that out here and\njust drop this cloud out here, Cloud 1.\n\n233\n00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,020\nClouds are where we can connect\nthese to our physical adapters.\n\n234\n00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,360\nAnd you could actually attach this to\na real physical adapter on your NIC, and\n\n235\n00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,790\nthen your routers would be able to\naccess your physical network, right?\n\n236\n00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,810\nIf you're doing a lab you\ndon't really want that.\n\n237\n00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,780\nBut if you want internet access\nfrom one of your lab items here,\n\n238\n00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,210\nthen you might wanna do that.\n\n239\n00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,730\nI want to attach to my loopback adapter.\n\n240\n00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,360\nSo what we can do,\nis we can plug this cloud into the switch,\n\n241\n00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,630\nand then we can plug the cloud\ninto our loopback adapter.\n\n242\n00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,914\nThat's gonna connect us into\nthis virtual environment.\n\n243\n00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:03,820\nIf you right-click on the cloud and choose\nConfigure, there's not a lot of options\n\n244\n00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,842\nin here, except the opportunity\nto map an adapter to the cloud.\n\n245\n00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:09,470\nAll right,\n\n246\n00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,440\nnow this screen, you really need to resize\nit to be able to see what's going on.\n\n247\n00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,530\nBecause the adapter names, it shows the\nraw adapter names, which are really long.\n\n248\n00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,430\nSo a lot of times,\n\n249\n00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,050\nyou'll just see these GUIDs and\nnot actually see the description.\n\n250\n00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,420\nSo I always stretch it out\nto see the description.\n\n251\n00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,440\nSo here on NIO ethernet, right,\nnetwork input output ethernet.\n\n252\n00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,070\nSo this is my ethernet\nconnection on the cloud.\n\n253\n00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,220\nI can pick an adapter to attach to it and\nthere's no adapters on the list right now.\n\n254\n00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,520\nI can drop this down and\npick from all of my adapters.\n\n255\n00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,440\nAnd if I was just going on the GUID,\nthis would be really hard.\n\n256\n00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,800\nBut since I stretched it out,\nI can actually look at it and\n\n257\n00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,270\nsee the descriptions.\n\n258\n00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,677\nAnd you'll see Microsoft\non local host Wi-Fi two,\n\n259\n00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:53,060\nlocal area connection eight, VirtualBox.\n\n260\n00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,810\nAnd this one right here,\nwell that's Bluetooth.\n\n261\n00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,270\nActually you know what,\nnone of them are showing my description.\n\n262\n00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,250\nSo I need to go and find the other name.\n\n263\n00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,376\nNetwork adapters can have more than one\nname, it's a little bit frustrating.\n\n264\n00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,390\nBut my loopback, I'm not sure\nwhich one of these it's gonna be.\n\n265\n00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,100\nThere's my VirtualBox adapter.\n\n266\n00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,095\nThere's a gigabit NetXtream adapter.\n\n267\n00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,330\nLet me switch over to my\ncommand prompt again and\n\n268\n00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,190\nsee what that adapter is actually called.\n\n269\n00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,734\nSo I'm just going to do an ipconfig\nhere to find my adapter and\n\n270\n00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:32,020\nI assigned it 192.160.0.100 and\nit's called GNS3 network.\n\n271\n00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,190\nIt is just not showing up in my list.\n\n272\n00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,160\nAll right.\n\n273\n00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,000\nIf it doesn't show up\nin the list like this,\n\n274\n00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,060\neven though you ran as administrator,\nyou might need to reboot.\n\n275\n00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,810\nAll right?\n\n276\n00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,450\nWhen you add those virtual\nadapters like this,\n\n277\n00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,460\nsometimes they don't show up until after\na reboot, so that's what I'm gonna do now.\n\n278\n00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,890\nNow obviously, when I reboot,\nmy screenshare is going to die, so\n\n279\n00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,670\nlet me just get outta here.\n\n280\n00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,210\nActually, I'm gonna save my\ntopology before I go too far.\n\n281\n00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,150\nAnd I'll reboot and we'll get a chance\nto see what's going on there, so,\n\n282\n00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,490\nlet me just get out of that,\nand we'll give it a reboot.\n\n283\n00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,308\nAll right, well, we'll pause the video\nhere so you don't have to sit here and\n\n284\n00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,330\nwatch me reboot,\nnot a whole lot of point in doing that.\n\n285\n00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,318\nAnd then when we get back, my system\nwill be rebooted and we'll go in and\n\n286\n00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:15,984\nattach that virtual adapter, so\nstay tuned I'll be right back.\n\n287\n00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:19,809\n[SOUND] All right, so\n\n288\n00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,764\nthe system's rebooted.\n\n289\n00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,696\nLet me just jump back into GNS3 here and\n\n290\n00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,590\nI think we'll have a little\nmore luck this time.\n\n291\n00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,500\nNow I can go back and\n\n292\n00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,080\nedit the configuration of that cloud,\nlike I was trying to before.\n\n293\n00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,320\nAnd when I go to configure in my cloud,\nI'll just stretch this window out,\n\n294\n00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,950\nlike I said.\n\n295\n00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,140\nAnd hopefully,\nwe'll see our network adapter this time.\n\n296\n00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,280\nYeah, there it is.\n\n297\n00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:51,210\nI've got my MS 6.0 loop back driver\non local host GNS 3 Network.\n\n298\n00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,550\nThere's that description, so I know\nthat's the virtual adapter that I added.\n\n299\n00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,840\nI'm gonna chose that and hit Add.\n\n300\n00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,770\nNotice down here, you've got Linux\nethernet, that's Linux only.\n\n301\n00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,792\nYou can do it right there for Linux,\nbut for Windows, we use this one.\n\n302\n00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,380\nChuck it right in And\nwe're pretty much in business.\n\n303\n00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,490\nSo now, my loop back adapter\nis bound to that cloud.\n\n304\n00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,590\nMy laptop which is 192.160.0.100\nis attached to the cloud.\n\n305\n00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:18,030\nThat's what I'm plugged into.\n\n306\n00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,020\nNow, I just need to plug that\ncloud into a switch or router.\n\n307\n00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,570\nAnd so I'm gonna run the cloud.\n\n308\n00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,420\nThat's my loop back adapter right there.\n\n309\n00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,400\nI'm gonna run it so the switch, and\n\n310\n00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,470\nI'll plug into a new port, port three\nthat it added, I didn't make that.\n\n311\n00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,004\nAnd there we go.\n\n312\n00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:38,928\nNow my PC is effectively plugged\ninto this switch, right?\n\n313\n00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:43,408\nAnd if I go into router one, oh actually\nI guess I probably turn it on, right?\n\n314\n00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,500\n[LAUGH] My routers are turned off.\n\n315\n00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,740\nSo if I go into router one,\nI'll just console into it real quick,\n\n316\n00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,580\nI can give it an IP address in the same\nsubnet, and I should see my machine.\n\n317\n00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,830\nNow a quick word of warning here.\n\n318\n00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,120\nIn Windows and in Linux and OSX,\nwe've got firewalls, right, and\n\n319\n00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,590\nyour firewall may interfere with the\ncommunications on that loop back adapter.\n\n320\n00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,800\nSo be aware that just\nbecause your ping fails,\n\n321\n00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,330\nit might be your firewall\nthat's blocking it.\n\n322\n00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,220\nSo right now, I've got an IP address.\n\n323\n00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,930\nActually I don't have an IP address,\nso let's go fix that.\n\n324\n00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,050\nSo I'm gonna get into my interface and\nassign an address.\n\n325\n00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,991\nI'll make router one 192.168.0.1,\n\n326\n00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,700\nand I'll do a no shut down.\n\n327\n00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:32,344\nAll right.\nAnd if I just check my interfaces,\n\n328\n00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:36,660\nthere we go, I'm 192.168.0.1.\n\n329\n00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,370\nMy interface is up.\n\n330\n00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:45,200\nI'm gonna try and\nsend a ping to 192.168.0.100.\n\n331\n00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,620\nNow when I send that ping,\nthe ping is travelling out the router,\n\n332\n00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,270\nto the switch,\nacross the switch to the cloud,\n\n333\n00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,790\nthe cloud hits my loop back adapter,\nand I'm 192.168.0.100.\n\n334\n00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,760\nIt should find it and get through.\n\n335\n00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,060\nBut like I said, my Windows firewall might\nbe stepping in the way and blocking that.\n\n336\n00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,650\nLet me just try one more time\nbecause sometimes the ARP\n\n337\n00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,560\nbroadcast can take a moment.\n\n338\n00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,830\nIf you're still not getting through,\nyou can try to ping the other way.\n\n339\n00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,810\nPing from your PC to the router and\nsee if that works for you, right?\n\n340\n00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,630\nSo I'll open up a command prompt here.\n\n341\n00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,680\nAnd I'll do a ping the other way,\ntrying to ping 192.168.0.1,\n\n342\n00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,400\nand you can see I'm successful.\n\n343\n00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,960\nMy PC can ping the router, that means it's\nmy Windows Firewall that's blocking it,\n\n344\n00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,240\nand so what I'd need to do is go and\n\n345\n00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,230\nput a Windows Firewall rule in allowing\nthat network to cross the line, or\n\n346\n00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,140\nturn off my Windows Firewall\nwhile I'm working on the lab.\n\n347\n00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,540\nIt depends on what level of\nsecurity you need to maintain,\n\n348\n00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,750\nwhich option is gonna be the one for you.\n\n349\n00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,250\nBut I can test this a little\nfurther if I try and\n\n350\n00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,590\nlike remotely connect to the router,\nright?\n\n351\n00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,890\nSo on the router, let me just do a quick\nbasic configuration on here right?\n\n352\n00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,720\nSo I might say triple A new-model,\nand user name admin,\n\n353\n00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,930\nprivilege 15, secret cisco123, right?\n\n354\n00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,049\nSo, I'm creating a user account for\nmyself, and\n\n355\n00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,665\nthen i'll turn on the web\nserver turning on that piece so\n\n356\n00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:18,780\nI get a nice little certificate.\n\n357\n00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,570\nAnd let's see,\nthat should be enough to get me connected.\n\n358\n00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,050\nSo, now the system is up and running.\n\n359\n00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,140\nIt's got a user account that I can connect\nwith, and the web server is turned on.\n\n360\n00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,930\nSo back on my PC,\nif I fire up something like,\n\n361\n00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,020\noh, I'll cause pain and\nfire up Internet Explorer.\n\n362\n00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,440\nAnd I try and\nbrowse to that router, 192.168.0.1.\n\n363\n00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,010\nHere I am, connected to it, and\n\n364\n00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,605\nif I can type my password, I'll get in.\n\n365\n00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:56,140\n[LAUGH] You know what,\n\n366\n00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,990\nmy HTTP authentication is probably\nnot configured correctly.\n\n367\n00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,786\nSo, I am getting the router, but\nI would like to show you guys a success,\n\n368\n00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,100\nnot a failure message like that so.\n\n369\n00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,000\nLet me go in here and\nwe do triple A authentication.\n\n370\n00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,650\nLet's see if I can remember how to\ndo this just off the top of my head.\n\n371\n00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:22,004\nActually I think it's There it is.\n\n372\n00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:24,290\nIP HTTP Authentication.\n\n373\n00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:32,660\nLocal, and that should be all I\nneed to do to get that working.\n\n374\n00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,430\nAnd now let me jump back to Internet\nExplorer and give that another shot.\n\n375\n00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,860\nThere we go.\n\n376\n00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,450\nAll right, so now I'm logged into\nthe web interface on that router.\n\n377\n00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,730\nNow I don't have the SDM.\n\n378\n00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,140\nSo I'm not going to fire that up and\nconnect.\n\n379\n00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,170\nBut if I did have the SDM, I could fire\nup that GUI, point it to the router, and\n\n380\n00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,930\nnow I would be able to\nwork from it on my PC.\n\n381\n00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,440\nAnd on my PC, I could create a FTP server\nor TFTP server for transferring backups of\n\n382\n00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,480\nconfigs, I could bring up a radius server\nin a virtual machine if I wanted and\n\n383\n00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,040\nattach it to that loop back, and\nthen they'd be able to see the routers.\n\n384\n00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,690\nNow I've really opened up\nthe functionality here and\n\n385\n00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,280\nI can get all sorts of stuff connected in.\n\n386\n00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,040\nThis is where the real fun starts, right?\n\n387\n00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,760\nI can even provide internet access\nto those routers if I need to,\n\n388\n00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,970\nfor them to be able to reach out and\ndo tests and things like that.\n\n389\n00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,090\nBut otherwise, I'm in here.\n\n390\n00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,290\nA lot of these commands\nare somewhat useless,\n\n391\n00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,270\nbecause I don't have the QOS\ndevice management installed.\n\n392\n00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,620\nBut it is nice.\n\n393\n00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,300\nThey show tech support for example,\n\n394\n00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,020\nwhich dumps out a ton of\ninformation about the router.\n\n395\n00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,200\nWe can bring that up and\nsee all sorts of good things in there.\n\n396\n00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,452\nIt's really neat, right?\n\n397\n00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:42,700\nI've now got connectivity between\nmy workstation and the router.\n\n398\n00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,460\nThat means that I can do things like\nconnecting directly to the router, right?\n\n399\n00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,480\nThis is the console port right here.\n\n400\n00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,700\nBut maybe I wanna log\ninto the router itself,\n\n401\n00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600\nnot going through the console port.\n\n402\n00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600\nSo, well it's up, actually SSH is on,\nso I should be able to SSH into it.\n\n403\n00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720\nLet me give that a shot.\n\n404\n00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,900\nSo I'm SSHing to 192.168.0.1 on port 22,\nright?\n\n405\n00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,561\nThat's not the console,\nI'm going to the actual router.\n\n406\n00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:12,670\nAnd when I go and open that up,\nIt should hit it, there we go.\n\n407\n00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,500\nGot my new key coming in.\n\n408\n00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,680\nI'll log in as admin.\n\n409\n00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,750\nCisco123, and there we go.\n\n410\n00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,320\nOh shoot.\n\n411\n00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,155\nI haven't [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:23,980\nI haven't configured my\nauthorization piece yet, and so\n\n413\n00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,540\nit's still giving me a little error there.\n\n414\n00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,170\nBut I'm in.\n\n415\n00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,000\nI can work with the system and\nif I do a show line,\n\n416\n00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,310\nI'll see that I'm on one of the VTYs.\n\n417\n00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,780\nMy console is still open somewhere,\nbut I'm on a VTY right now.\n\n418\n00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,950\nActually, if I do show IP ssh.\n\n419\n00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,960\nAnd show user.\n\n420\n00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,690\nThere we go.\n\n421\n00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,785\nI can see admin login on\nthe VTY right there, and\n\n422\n00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:49,370\nI'm coming from 192.168.0.100, right?\n\n423\n00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,770\nSo that's how we can get connected.\n\n424\n00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,450\nObviously the console is the fastest way.\n\n425\n00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,560\nAnd the nice thing about the console\nis you get all the debug\n\n426\n00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,140\nlogging automatically, but\nthis is a little more realistic.\n\n427\n00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,260\nThis is a little more real world.\n\n428\n00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,660\nYou'll SSH or Telnet into your routers,\nhopefully not Telnet.\n\n429\n00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,380\nWith this, if I do debugs,\nI don't get those messages right out.\n\n430\n00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,620\nI have to do terminal monitor\nto be able to see those,\n\n431\n00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,340\nwhich would only work by enable.\n\n432\n00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,070\nBut this gives me that connectivity.\n\n433\n00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,260\nNow I've got full access and\nI'm ready to work in the system.\n\n434\n00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,040\nAll right.\n\n435\n00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,720\nWell that's a pretty good\nspot to stop this video.\n\n436\n00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,040\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n437\n00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,610\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more videos coming up on\n\n438\n00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,430\nhow to do some of the more\nadvanced features inside of GNS3.\n\n439\n00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,260\nThere's a lot of cool\nstuff under the hood.\n\n440\n00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,310\nHope you guys enjoyed it,\nI'll see you next time.\n\n441\n00:23:37,310

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:08,140\n[SOUND].\n\n2\n00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,310\nOne of the cooler features in GNS3\nis integration with Wireshark.\n\n3\n00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,450\nA lot of times when we configure\nsettings on our routers,\n\n4\n00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,720\nwe have to make certain\nassumptions about the traffic.\n\n5\n00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,460\nFor example, let's say you set a VPN\ntunnel up between two routers.\n\n6\n00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,960\nHow do you really know the traffic is\nbeing encrypted that's being sent between\n\n7\n00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,870\nthe two routers?\n\n8\n00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,660\nYou've got physical\nconnectivity between them,\n\n9\n00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,900\nso maybe traffic's going unencrypted.\n\n10\n00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,780\nHow do we know?\n\n11\n00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,810\nWell, we can trust what\nthe routers tell us.\n\n12\n00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,210\nBut if we could attach a protocol\nanalyzer or a packet sniffer\n\n13\n00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,630\nright here on the wire, we'd be able\nto see the traffic on the wire and\n\n14\n00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,410\ndetermine whether it was encrypted or\nnot, right.\n\n15\n00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,700\nSo that's one of the cool things\nwe have in real life land, right.\n\n16\n00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,010\nOn a physical network you can plug\na sniffer in, you can capture traffic.\n\n17\n00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,430\nBut in a virtual environment like\nthis that's not normally possible.\n\n18\n00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,820\nWell in GNS3, it is.\n\n19\n00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,170\nIn our network,\nat any point in our network,\n\n20\n00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,990\nyou can right-click on a cable and\nchoose Start Capturing.\n\n21\n00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,030\nThat'll start capturing traffic on that\nline and storing it to a file, all right.\n\n22\n00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,530\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n23\n00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,140\nI'm just gonna hit, Start Capturing.\n\n24\n00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,680\nIt's gonna ask me which\ninterface I'm capturing for.\n\n25\n00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,750\nIf there's two routers here,\nit's asking which interface I want.\n\n26\n00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,670\nBut in my case I've got a virtual switch\nin between it so I only see the router.\n\n27\n00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,530\nSo I'll pick that one and\nI'll say to start capturing it.\n\n28\n00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,620\nNot much is different to me now, but\n\n29\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,220\nin the background, any traffic being sent\nover that line is now being captured.\n\n30\n00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,180\nIf the router's just sitting there,\nI expect to see things like\n\n31\n00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,700\nCisco Discovery Protocol, CDP, or\nRIP the Router Information Protocol.\n\n32\n00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,020\nThey're communicating over the line even\nwhen the router is just sitting there.\n\n33\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,240\nBut other things, other activities that I\nmight send like my data, just the regular\n\n34\n00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,380\nrouted data, is gonna cross that\nline also, and it's being captured.\n\n35\n00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,130\nWhile the capture is running you can\nright-click on the line again, and\n\n36\n00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,870\nnow we've got a new menu option\nwhich is start WireShark.\n\n37\n00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,960\nAnd if we start that up,\nit's gonna launch up here and\n\n38\n00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,840\nnow I'm in Wireshark and it's showing\nme what's going on, on that line.\n\n39\n00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,270\nAnd as I look at it, sure enough,\nthere's some CDP traffic,\n\n40\n00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,840\nCisco Discovery Protocol right there.\n\n41\n00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,780\nAnd, you know, I've got some\nother loop back traffic going on.\n\n42\n00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,560\nThere's more CDP.\n\n43\n00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,230\nCDP sends out a broadcast every,\nI think it's every 30 seconds.\n\n44\n00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,320\nWell, actually we can find out right here,\nright.\n\n45\n00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,510\nSo I had one happen,\nthe time stamp was 8.37.\n\n46\n00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,370\nThe next one happened here at 41.98.\n\n47\n00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,520\nSo that's basically 30 seconds apart that\nthat's happening, it's a little bit more.\n\n48\n00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,060\nCDP is doing it's stuff every 30 seconds.\n\n49\n00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,480\nI'm running RIP on these systems also,\nthe Routing Information Protocol.\n\n50\n00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640\nRIP has a slightly longer timer though,\nbut\n\n51\n00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,110\nI should see it anytime since I'm, oh\nactually, I'm already seeing it, aren't I?\n\n52\n00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,185\nThese giant, highlighted in red,\nwhere you can't miss them ones,\n\n53\n00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,790\nthat I'm not looking at.\n\n54\n00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,410\nHere's rip though,\nsending out it's communications.\n\n55\n00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,090\nRip version one, every so often, every\n30 seconds, sending out its messages and\n\n56\n00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,110\nannouncements right.\n\n57\n00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,620\nSo I can see that traffic right there,\nI can actually verify that it's happening.\n\n58\n00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,410\nAnd now if I generate some other\nlike more exciting payload, right.\n\n59\n00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,840\nHere I'll jump over to router one, and\n\n60\n00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,860\nmaybe on router one I\ntelnet to router two.\n\n61\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,480\nSo I'm gonna telnet over to router two,\nand I'll log in and I'll get to work.\n\n62\n00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360\nI'm gonna get in here and\nstart doing my work.\n\n63\n00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:24,362\nYou know, maybe I'll assign\nan IP address to an interface.\n\n64\n00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,300\nAnd do a no shut down.\n\n65\n00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560\nAnd we'll add that to RIP.\n\n66\n00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,880\nSo this is just me doing my normal work.\n\n67\n00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,310\nAnd, oh I'm class four right now.\n\n68\n00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,420\nI guess we'll do the whole class B,\nwhy not.\n\n69\n00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,450\nAll right, so I'm in here.\n\n70\n00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,540\nI'm doing my work.\n\n71\n00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,889\nI'm getting things setup all via Telnet.\n\n72\n00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:51,480\nThat Telnet session is going from router\none across this line to router two.\n\n73\n00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,320\nSo it should have all been captured.\n\n74\n00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,260\nAnd if I go back to WireShark Looks\nlike you got a frame error.\n\n75\n00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,440\nBut it should have continued.\n\n76\n00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,670\nLet's see if it actually, yeah it did.\n\n77\n00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,440\nGood.\n\n78\n00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,660\nOne of my frames came in too large and\nit made Wireshark get upset.\n\n79\n00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,650\nBut the rest of it.\n\n80\n00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,080\nI can see that Telnet traffic right there.\n\n81\n00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,780\nSo that's me communicating\nbetween those two routers.\n\n82\n00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,940\nI can actually see what's\ngoing on on the network\n\n83\n00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,740\nversus having to trust that\nit's happening that way.\n\n84\n00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,900\nIf I thought this was going over\na VPN tunnel, I know it's not now,\n\n85\n00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,190\nbecause I can see it.\n\n86\n00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,560\nAnd I could go and\nreassemble that if I wanted to, and\n\n87\n00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,720\nactually see the communication, or at\nleast what Wireshark got before it died.\n\n88\n00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,050\nYeah, it did, it actually died out.\n\n89\n00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,550\nHm.\n\n90\n00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,140\nIf it dies out like that you\ncan always close Wireshark.\n\n91\n00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,700\nAnd if the capture is still running\nyou can just restart Wireshark and\n\n92\n00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,958\nit'll normally get happy again.\n\n93\n00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:45,000\nNo, frame 93 two on, so I've got a bad\nframe but basically it is working.\n\n94\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,290\nIt is capturing that data.\n\n95\n00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,290\nI'd have to stop and start the capture\nagain to get around that, but\n\n96\n00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,360\nthat's how Wireshark works,\nreally neat visibility.\n\n97\n00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,240\nWe didn't have to change\nany settings in Wireshark.\n\n98\n00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,460\nBasically, GSN3 is pushing\nthat from the command line,\n\n99\n00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,920\nit's telling Wireshark, hey, when you\nlaunch, don't load from a network adapter,\n\n100\n00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,700\ninstead load from this file,\nthis file that I'm updating right now.\n\n101\n00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,480\nSo I'm gonna put my updates in the file,\nyou display it.\n\n102\n00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,880\nSo it's already doing that, it's showing\nme the information all in real time.\n\n103\n00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,580\nDown here you can actually see that file.\n\n104\n00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,220\nIt's a temporary file, it's stuck\nin my user profile down here and\n\n105\n00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,600\nit's just up running doing its thing.\n\n106\n00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,030\nYeah so a bad frame, so i did get a bad\nframe if i just stop the capture.\n\n107\n00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,840\nSo ill just stop it and start it again,\nthat'll start an all new file and\n\n108\n00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,340\nit'll get past that bad frame.\n\n109\n00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,270\nAnd now.\n\n110\n00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,510\nI can fire up Wireshark, and\nwill be watching it again and\n\n111\n00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,860\nseeing all that action happen.\n\n112\n00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,000\nSo very exciting stuff right well,\nthis is incredibly exciting here but,\n\n113\n00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,990\nwhen you're troubleshooting a protocol\nwhere you're trying to see whether\n\n114\n00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,620\nyour RIP announcements are really\ngoing out every thirty seconds,\n\n115\n00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,100\nwhether your rip announcements\nare Rip version one doing unicast or\n\n116\n00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,280\nrip version two doing multicast,\nyou'd see that here, right?\n\n117\n00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880\nWhen you go and find these packets, like\nthis one here, this is a RIP response,\n\n118\n00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,910\nI can see that it came from router one,\n192.168.0.1, and\n\n119\n00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,280\nI can see the destination 255.255.255.255,\nit broadcast out.\n\n120\n00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,950\nRIP version one uses broadcast,\nI can see it.\n\n121\n00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,270\nIf I go back to my routers,\nI can switch them over to version 2 and\n\n122\n00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,340\nI should see that change to multicasts.\n\n123\n00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,830\nSo if I go to router rip and throw in\na little version 2 action here, and\n\n124\n00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,110\nI'll do the same on this side.\n\n125\n00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:39,540\nAll right so\nthose guys are now going to switch over.\n\n126\n00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,590\nNow I assume that RIP is actually\ndoing the multicast like it says, but\n\n127\n00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,110\nI don't have to assume anymore because I\ncan just jump over to Wireshark and watch.\n\n128\n00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,250\nAnd now when I start to see RIP\ncommunications going out, see how I've got\n\n129\n00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,530\nbroadcast here, broadcast here,\nbroadcast here, multicast here 224.0.0.9.\n\n130\n00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,730\nI can see it switched and\nits no longer RIP version one\n\n131\n00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,050\nnow its RIP version two, now things\nare running the way that I want and\n\n132\n00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,230\nI know their multicast because\nI can see it right here.\n\n133\n00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,850\nRight.\n\n134\n00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,720\nThat's the real power of\nhaving Wireshark integrated.\n\n135\n00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,820\nAnd you can save these, you can filter\nthem, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n136\n00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,590\nIf you haven't watched our series\non how to use Wireshark you should\n\n137\n00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,490\ncheck that out.\n\n138\n00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,490\nI kind of run through all the different\nstuff that you can do inside of Wireshark,\n\n139\n00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,300\nit's a really powerful program.\n\n140\n00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,760\nBut from GNS3 it's just a great way to\nsee what traffic is going over the line.\n\n141\n00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,020\nOne work of advice though,\n\n142\n00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,540\nwhen you're done with Wireshark always\nremember to come in and stop the capture.\n\n143\n00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,270\nIf you don't stop the capture it's going\nto continue to gather in the background.\n\n144\n00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,730\nAnd that file will get larger and\nlarger and larger.\n\n145\n00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,600\nYou could potentially fill up your\nhard drive if you forget about it and\n\n146\n00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160\nleave it running for a day or two.\n\n147\n00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,000\nThere's not gonna be a lot of data\nmoving over your virtual network but\n\n148\n00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,380\nrouting protocols, if you do dynamic\nupdates, they add up over time.\n\n149\n00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,620\nYou know that's all data\nbeing sent across the line.\n\n150\n00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,660\nCisco discovery protocol, all those things\ncreate a ton of chatter on the line.\n\n151\n00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,250\nAlright but other than that using\nWireshark inside of GNS3, pretty easy.\n\n152\n00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,462\nSo definitely use that,\nit's a cool feature.\n\n153\n00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,590\nAll right well stay tuned,\n\n154\n00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,960\nwe've got more episodes coming up\nwith addition information on GNS3.\n\n155\n00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,785\nYou know it's a powerful program, lot of\nfeatures there, so I hope to see you then.\n\n156\n00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:26,824\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,164\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:08,051\n[SOUND] In GNS3, you can start to build\n\n3\n00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:12,183\nsome pretty complex networks.\n\n4\n00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:15,983\nAnd as you lay them out in your map, you\ncan have more routers and more devices and\n\n5\n00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,910\nit really does start to grow.\n\n6\n00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,610\nSo one of the more handy things we can\ndo is to create a network diagram.\n\n7\n00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,100\nAnd I know a lot of people\nuse Microsoft Vizio or\n\n8\n00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,610\nother software like that to create\ntheir diagrams to have them handy, but\n\n9\n00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,170\nthere's actually some diagramming\nfunctionality right inside of GNS3 that\n\n10\n00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,670\nyou can take advantage of and\nyou don't need separate software for it.\n\n11\n00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,390\nSo let me show you how that works.\n\n12\n00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,430\nWhen I have networks like this, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,763\nIn between router one and\nrouter two there's a switch, and\n\n14\n00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:46,678\nthis is the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet.\n\n15\n00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:49,680\nNow, I know that because\nI set up this router.\n\n16\n00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,820\nBut what if I want to share this\ntopology with someone else?\n\n17\n00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,440\nThey might not know the networks like\nI do, cuz I'm the one who made it.\n\n18\n00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,908\nIt's easier for me to remember.\n\n19\n00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:58,830\nIf I wanna make it easier for\n\n20\n00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,820\nthem, I can add notations to\nthe screen to dictate that.\n\n21\n00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,850\nYou'll see up top where you can\nadd in things to your diagram,\n\n22\n00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,710\nlike circles, squares, and notes.\n\n23\n00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,705\nEven pictures if you have some kind\nof a network map or whatever that you\n\n24\n00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,120\nwanna throw in there, maybe a map of\nyour building you wanna throw in there.\n\n25\n00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,062\nYou can do stuff like that.\n\n26\n00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:18,419\nBut I normally make use of circles and\nnotes.\n\n27\n00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:21,471\nSo, I'm gonna draw a circle, and\n\n28\n00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:26,342\nwhen you draw a circle there's\nnot all that much to it.\n\n29\n00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:30,300\nWe kinda drag it around to\nfit where it is we want it.\n\n30\n00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,040\nWe try and drag it around to\nwhere we want it at least.\n\n31\n00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,965\nI made mine a little bit on the big side.\n\n32\n00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,001\nSo I'm gonna draw it like that, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,740\nSo there's my circle, and if you right\nclick on it, you can choose to set a style\n\n34\n00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,090\nto it, duplicate it, raise it a layer,\nlower it a layer, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,680\nThese items all layer\non top of each other.\n\n36\n00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,070\nSee how the routers are sitting\non top of that dashed line?\n\n37\n00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,320\nThis circle just went\nbehind those routers.\n\n38\n00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,640\nIf I right click again,\nI can choose to raise it a layer and\n\n39\n00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,330\nnow see how the circle's\non top of the routers?\n\n40\n00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,030\nSo you can build this where you've\ngot things several layers deep and\n\n41\n00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,680\nyou dictate which order\nthe objects are displayed in.\n\n42\n00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,975\nI want my circle to be all the way in\nthe back, and I'm gonna change its style.\n\n43\n00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,307\nThe style's gonna let us change the line,\nas well as the coloring.\n\n44\n00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:20,130\nI want the color,\nwell the color right now is black.\n\n45\n00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,330\nThat's the dashed line\naround the outside is black.\n\n46\n00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,130\nThat's exactly what I want,\nso I'm gonna leave that be.\n\n47\n00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,690\nThe font would be text if I\nwas throwing it in there.\n\n48\n00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,892\nThe border color,\nI can see that one's black.\n\n49\n00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:32,810\nActually, you know what?\nI've got it backwards, don't I?\n\n50\n00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,420\nThe select color here is the inside.\n\n51\n00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,700\nI'm gonna make it like a light green.\n\n52\n00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,750\nEw, that's a terrible green.\n\n53\n00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,250\nLet's try that one.\n\n54\n00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,246\nThere we go.\n\n55\n00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,689\nSo, see how it just turned light green?\n\n56\n00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,700\nBecause that's the color I chose\nup here when I did Select Color.\n\n57\n00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,870\nIt's got green.\n\n58\n00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,040\nThe border is black and that's fine.\n\n59\n00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,070\nThat's what I want.\n\n60\n00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,090\nAnd for the font, well I'm not\nputting any text on it just yet.\n\n61\n00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,540\nI'll do that in a minute,\nso I'll leave that be.\n\n62\n00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,722\nI've got the border width and\nthe border style.\n\n63\n00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,680\nI'm gonna make my border just\na little bit thicker and\n\n64\n00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,450\nI'm gonna change it to a solid line,\nall right?\n\n65\n00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,140\nAnd when I say okay,\napparently it didn't like that.\n\n66\n00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,090\nLet me go back in here and\ndouble check that.\n\n67\n00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,120\nMaybe that width going a little too high.\n\n68\n00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,850\nBut my select color, oh,\nit went back to black.\n\n69\n00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,160\nAll right, well,\nlet's put it back to green.\n\n70\n00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,920\nThere we go.\n\n71\n00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,041\nNow I've got a nice green circle right\nthere, which I can use to denote a subnet,\n\n72\n00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:22,662\nall right?\n\n73\n00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:27,860\nSo the circle's got that and\nnow I can go up to my notes and\n\n74\n00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:35,090\nI can stick a note right here,\nand I can say 192.168.0.0/24.\n\n75\n00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,370\nThat's that subnet right there and\nnow I can remember that's what it is.\n\n76\n00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,780\nAnd if somebody were to log in and\nI share this with them, they would see it.\n\n77\n00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,270\nNow I do have a little problem.\n\n78\n00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,960\nMy circle is on top of the link.\n\n79\n00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,770\nI can't see the links\nbetween my routers anymore.\n\n80\n00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,319\nSo I'm gonna continue to hit lower layer.\n\n81\n00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,840\nThere we go.\n\n82\n00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,210\nUntil it's back and\nnow the links are on top of it.\n\n83\n00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,720\nGreen might not have\nbeen the best color here,\n\n84\n00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,420\ncuz now it's hard to see the link lights.\n\n85\n00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,430\nSo, you might have to mess with\nit a little bit until you find\n\n86\n00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,590\nthe proper color sequence or\nwhatever that you wanna use.\n\n87\n00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,310\nMaybe we'll go brown.\n\n88\n00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,370\nThere we are.\n\n89\n00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,670\nSo I've got it laid out right there,\nall right?\n\n90\n00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,720\nAnd I can continue to document my network\nthis way, adding circles or squares,\n\n91\n00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,540\nor whatever.\n\n92\n00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,450\nMaybe I wanna do a square over here\nto denote this network, and so\n\n93\n00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:28,030\nI'll make it a little bit bigger, and have\nit come over here and contact Router 1.\n\n94\n00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,180\nAnd then I'll change its style,\njust like I did on the other one,\n\n95\n00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,990\nmaybe I'll make this one a dark blue,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,190\nAnd let me fix that border.\n\n97\n00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,330\nIt says that the border is solid but\nit sure doesn't look like it.\n\n98\n00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,260\nThere it goes, now it's solid.\n\n99\n00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,310\nI've got that whole problem of\ncovering the links again, so\n\n100\n00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,259\nI'm gonna lower it a layer.\n\n101\n00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,481\nOkay, so there it is, it's behind.\n\n102\n00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:56,805\nAnd if I go and\nstick a note on top of this one I can say,\n\n103\n00:04:56,805 --> 00:05:02,371\nthis is the 192.168.1.0/24 network.\n\n104\n00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:05,610\nNow, I do have a little problem here\nthat I can barely read that text.\n\n105\n00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,620\nSo, I might wanna change the style of\nthat text to be a different color.\n\n106\n00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,110\nSo, the font is fine.\n\n107\n00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,590\nI guess I could make it a bigger font,\nmake it easier to read there, but for\n\n108\n00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,210\nthe color, let me make that white.\n\n109\n00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,000\nThat should stand out a little better.\n\n110\n00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,790\nThere we go.\n\n111\n00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,430\nNow I can easily read that and see it,\nand tell it that's what that network is.\n\n112\n00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,270\nOr I could have just picked a better\ncolor, that blue is pretty harsh.\n\n113\n00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,020\nSo [LAUGH] you can manipulate\nthis however you want.\n\n114\n00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,080\nKinda customize it, get things set.\n\n115\n00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,728\nAnd then once you've got it in place,\nnow it's really easy to just\n\n116\n00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,369\nvisually look at this and say, okay,\nthat's the 192.168.00 network.\n\n117\n00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,275\nThis is the 192.168.1.0 network.\n\n118\n00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,839\nIt's all right there.\n\n119\n00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,007\nI don't have to login to the router and\ndo a show IP interface brief or\n\n120\n00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,800\nanything like that to\nfind out those networks.\n\n121\n00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,230\nYou can make use of this,\nit's all saved with your topology.\n\n122\n00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,310\nSo when you open up this\nnetwork again later on,\n\n123\n00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,690\nit'll all be laid out just like this and\nit works out really well.\n\n124\n00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,770\nAnd if you wanna print it out to have it\nlike on a piece of paper next to you,\n\n125\n00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,240\nyou can use the camera button\nup here to take a snapshot, and\n\n126\n00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,680\nwhen you do that it'll\nsave it as a PNG file.\n\n127\n00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,980\nSo let me just do that here\nI'll save it to my desktop.\n\n128\n00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,130\nAnd now I can go into my desktop and\n\n129\n00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,400\nfind that topology file I just dumped and\nthere it is.\n\n130\n00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,590\nThere's my network diagram.\n\n131\n00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,570\nI can print that out on a piece of paper.\n\n132\n00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,350\nAnd now I've got it easy to work with as\nI get in there and work with my network.\n\n133\n00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,880\nSo, very handy feature.\n\n134\n00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,885\nWe don't need separate software\nlike Vizio to do this.\n\n135\n00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,480\nIt's not the most advanced\nstuff in the world.\n\n136\n00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,770\nI can't put custom objects in there.\n\n137\n00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,880\nIf you wanted to do a custom object,\n\n138\n00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,470\nyou'd have to have it as an image and\nbring it in using that image button.\n\n139\n00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,540\nSo I can hit that and bring in items.\n\n140\n00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,410\nThat can be kinda handy sometimes.\n\n141\n00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,420\nFor example, maybe you're\nbuilding a lab for somebody and\n\n142\n00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,350\nyou want them to work in this router and\nthis switch, but\n\n143\n00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,030\nyou don't want them to work\nin any of this other stuff.\n\n144\n00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,230\nSo you may not even include these,\n\n145\n00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,210\nyou might just put a picture\nthat shows these items, and\n\n146\n00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,830\nthen you add your other routers on top of\nit to make it look like they were there.\n\n147\n00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,480\nSo, there's different things like that you\ncan do to manipulate the diagrams, but for\n\n148\n00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,510\nthe most part that's it.\n\n149\n00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,900\nSo, there's some good\ndocumentation features in there.\n\n150\n00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,720\nMake use of them, right?\n\n151\n00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,670\nThey're pretty handy and they'll help you\nkeep track of your networks a lot better.\n\n152\n00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,980\nAll right,\nhope you guys enjoyed that video.\n\n153\n00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,075\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more\n\n154\n00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,070\nGNS3 information in our other videos.\n\n155\n00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,439\nBe sure to check out our whole library,\nright?\n\n156\n00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,918\nWe go through the all the different\nfeatures and what you can do.\n\n157\n00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,559\nIt's powerful software, so\nthere's a lot of features.\n\n158\n00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:29,607\nAll right,\nhope to see you in the other videos.\n\n159\n00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:35,089\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,591\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,898\nAll right, you might be asking yourself,\nwhy did I just hit play on a video that's\n\n3\n00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,300\ngonna tell me how to\nsave my configuration.\n\n4\n00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,150\nEverybody knows how to go to file and\nsave, this is the dumbest video ever.\n\n5\n00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,710\nWell, unfortunately,\n\n6\n00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,380\nthere are some little quirks to how we\nsave our configurations inside of GNS3.\n\n7\n00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,110\nSo I wanted to do a video that\nkind of highlighted some of that.\n\n8\n00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,060\nYes, you're right,\nwhen you develop a topology in GNS3,\n\n9\n00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,190\nyou can just go to File > Save Project,\nright.\n\n10\n00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,880\nAnd that will save your project and\nstore it on the hard drive.\n\n11\n00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,420\nIt does give you a little warning,\nit's gonna stop all the devices and\n\n12\n00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,240\nback them up.\n\n13\n00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,000\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay yes to that, and let it backup.\n\n14\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,351\nI give it a project name, so\nI'll call this my Show Topology and\n\n15\n00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:52,920\nit's gonna back it up to a directory\ninside of my user folder.\n\n16\n00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,600\nIt does have a few options.\n\n17\n00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,040\nI can save the NVRAM inside of the device.\n\n18\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,940\nNow what's in the NVRAM?\n\n19\n00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,670\nOur start up configs, right?\n\n20\n00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,300\nIf you don't save the start up config,\n\n21\n00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,340\nwhat you're really backing up is just\nyour topology, this network layout.\n\n22\n00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,940\nIf I were to hit save\nwith how it is right now.\n\n23\n00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,900\nWhen I restore my system, when I open up\nGNS3 and I open up this project my routers\n\n24\n00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,100\nwill have no configuration, they'll\nstart up with default configurations.\n\n25\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,860\nSo, I need to make sure\nthat I save NVRAM so\n\n26\n00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,470\nthat I get the start up configurations so\nthat way when I boot them back up they'll\n\n27\n00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,020\nbe where I left them off as long as I\nremembered to save my configuration.\n\n28\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,550\nThat's quirk number one we\nneed to remember to do that\n\n29\n00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,930\notherwise we'll lose our router configs.\n\n30\n00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,750\nSome of the other options you have here,\nthings like unbase images when saving.\n\n31\n00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,180\nWhen you save an image, especially for\n\n32\n00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,070\nthe virtual machines that use QEMU,\nthey can be tied to a master image.\n\n33\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,980\nIf you choose to unbase it,\nit'll make copies of that master so\n\n34\n00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,820\nthat it's easier to move this\nproject to other computers.\n\n35\n00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,180\nIf you’re not using any of the QEMU\nstuff you don’t have to worry about it.\n\n36\n00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,640\nIf you’re using several routers\nof the same iOS, this will create\n\n37\n00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,970\nmultiple copies that iOS, but\nagain that’s not necessarily a big deal.\n\n38\n00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,655\nAnd then we’ve got Save capture traffic.\n\n39\n00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:11,595\nIf you're running Wire Shark, and doing\ntraffic captures of the network passing\n\n40\n00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:14,335\nacross the line,\nthe default is not to save that stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,035\nAnd so, if you want to, you can check that\noff, but normally we just want to make\n\n42\n00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:21,515\nsure we check save NVRAMs, and\nwe hit OK, and now it's backed up.\n\n43\n00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,735\nAll my routers stopped, but\nthat's not the end of the world.\n\n44\n00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,390\nI can always start them right back up,\nand off we go.\n\n45\n00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,590\nOkay, notice down here it says\nexporting Router 2 configuration,\n\n46\n00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,380\nexporting Router 1 configuration.\n\n47\n00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,700\nSo it did dump the configs\nto a text file so\n\n48\n00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,390\nthat it can load them back up again,\nall right.\n\n49\n00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,980\nLet me give you one\nword of warning though.\n\n50\n00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,410\nI'm gonna start this up, and\napparently it wasn't happy with that.\n\n51\n00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,110\nLooks like it didn't cleanly stop.\n\n52\n00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,890\nI hate it when that happens.\n\n53\n00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,690\nIf you ever have that happen when\nthe routers don't cleanly stop right,\n\n54\n00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,550\nit's usually tied to the fact that I had\nconsole windows open when it shut down.\n\n55\n00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,440\nI should have closed those but I didn't.\n\n56\n00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,730\nIf that ever happens,\n\n57\n00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,510\nthe best thing to do is to get out of\nGNS3 It's gonna ask me if I wanna save.\n\n58\n00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,430\nI'll go ahead and let it save, all right.\n\n59\n00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,710\nAnd then, check in your Task Manager\nto make sure it's not still running.\n\n60\n00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,190\nNow it's not gonna be listed as GNS3,\nremember the emulator under the hood is\n\n61\n00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,940\ncalled Dynamips, so\nthat's what I need to look for.\n\n62\n00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,620\nI'm just gonna look and see if I have any\nprocesses called Dynamips, and I don't.\n\n63\n00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,720\nAnd so now I can fire it up and\nget a clean start.\n\n64\n00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,760\nSo, I'll fire it back up, and\nI'm gonna open up my topology.\n\n65\n00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,180\nWell, after I get passed my tip screen.\n\n66\n00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,930\nSo, I'm gonna choose to open a product,\nand I'll pick that show topology that I\n\n67\n00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,670\njust did a moment ago, and\nit's gonna load that one up.\n\n68\n00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:41,610\nAll right, so here's my topology,\njust like I like it.\n\n69\n00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,950\nNow, let me start up Router 1,\nwhen I start it up and\n\n70\n00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,160\nconnect to it,\nit should have my configuration.\n\n71\n00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,210\nNow I say should,\nbecause sometimes it doesn't.\n\n72\n00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,700\nI have seen this more than once,\n\n73\n00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,222\nwhere even though I told it\nto save the NVRAM, it didn't.\n\n74\n00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:00,140\nSo we'll find out here in just a moment,\nas soon this is done booting up,\n\n75\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,010\nwhether or\nnot it's got my proper config on there.\n\n76\n00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,390\nSo here it's going,\nI had assigned some ip addresses to it.\n\n77\n00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,390\nI had turned on the rip\nrouting protocol so\n\n78\n00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,030\nI expect to see that in my running\nconfigurations when I go in here.\n\n79\n00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,400\nIf I don't see it I know it didn't get it,\nbut it did.\n\n80\n00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,080\nI've got my ip addresses right there and\nI've got my rip configuration right there.\n\n81\n00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,250\nSo yup, it's got my configuration,\nthis router is up and healthy.\n\n82\n00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,041\nAll right,\n\n83\n00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,830\nnow more than once I've had GNS3 not\nsave my start up config like it said.\n\n84\n00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,460\nIf it happens to you,\nthere's a quick way to check and\n\n85\n00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,960\nsee if that's about to happen.\n\n86\n00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,580\nBefore you close GNS3, before, at the end\nof the day you hit save and before you\n\n87\n00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,410\nclose it, what I like to do is right click\non a router, like I'll use Router 2 here.\n\n88\n00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,120\nAnd when you right click on it, you'll see\nan entry in here that says startup config.\n\n89\n00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,750\nYou can click on that, and\n\n90\n00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,480\nit will show you what GNS3 thinks\nthe startup config is going to be.\n\n91\n00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,770\nIf it's blank, that means GNS3\ndidn't actually back it up.\n\n92\n00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,250\nSo it's a real quick easy way to check.\n\n93\n00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,357\nIf you come in here and\nit looks like this.\n\n94\n00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:10,450\nThat's an easy way to let you know,\nthis router, it's not\n\n95\n00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,610\nactually got its config and the way you\nfix that, is you start the router up.\n\n96\n00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,550\nIt needs to be running and\nyou go to Startup Config,\n\n97\n00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,820\nand this will be blank, right?\n\n98\n00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,370\nAnd you just hit load config from NVRAM.\n\n99\n00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,240\nThat'll force it to go to the router,\nget the config out of NVRAM, and\n\n100\n00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200\nthrow it right here.\n\n101\n00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,880\nThis is what's gonna be backed\nup to that file, all right.\n\n102\n00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,079\nSo if you ever see that being blank,\nthat's your warning sign.\n\n103\n00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,280\nThat's your warning sign to say,\nfor whatever reason,\n\n104\n00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,825\nGNS3 didn't pick up the config and\nit happens more often than you'd think.\n\n105\n00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,625\nIt actually happened to\nme before this show,\n\n106\n00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,055\nwhich is why I'm filming this\nepisode in the first place.\n\n107\n00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:50,270\nSo it is something that happens and\nI just wanted you to have a heads up.\n\n108\n00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,650\nOtherwise, once you save it,\nyour topology has been backed up.\n\n109\n00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:01,420\nThe most important part of your\ntopology is the topology file itself.\n\n110\n00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,140\nYou'll have a file that ends in .net,\nso if I go in here to my projects and\n\n111\n00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,035\nshow topology.\n\n112\n00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:12,390\nTopology.net, that's the main topology\nfile and it's just a text file.\n\n113\n00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,890\nIf you edit it like I'll\nopen it with Wordpad.\n\n114\n00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:18,575\nDo I have something good?\n\n115\n00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,305\nYes, sublime text.\n\n116\n00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,845\nWe'll open it with that.\n\n117\n00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:25,245\nThere, it's just a text file, and it lays\nout the various systems that are on here.\n\n118\n00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,865\nSo, what iOS file I'm loading,\n\n119\n00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:32,825\nwhat interfaces it's got, what they're\nmapped to, if I have a virtual switch.\n\n120\n00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,385\nThere's router 1, router 2,\nand all of that is laid out.\n\n121\n00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:40,810\nHere's my notes that I added to\nthe screen and even the circle and\n\n122\n00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,770\nsquare they'll be in here too with\ntheir little text coordinates so\n\n123\n00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,710\nit knows where to draw them on the screen.\n\n124\n00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,500\nIt's all just stored right\nhere in this text file.\n\n125\n00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,790\nNothing too terribly special about it, but\n\n126\n00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,790\nyou'll see other folders too like\nwhere the configs are stored.\n\n127\n00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,960\nAnd those are just text files.\n\n128\n00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,580\nWe can open those with\nany kind of text editor.\n\n129\n00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,300\nSo here's router one's config\nlaid out right here for me.\n\n130\n00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,290\nI can look at it.\n\n131\n00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,330\nYou can even edit it and\n\n132\n00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,568\nthe next time you fire up the router's it\nwill load this in as the start up config.\n\n133\n00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,750\nSo it's kinda neat to be able to do that.\n\n134\n00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,180\nSo saving your configurations not that\nbig of a deal File > Save Project.\n\n135\n00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,460\nMake sure you tick off that check mark\nthat says save the NVRAM though if you\n\n136\n00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,160\nwant to save your start up configs\notherwise they will get lost, all right.\n\n137\n00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,390\nSo just quick word to the wise.\n\n138\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,475\nOne last thing I wanna mention is you\ndo have a handy little button up here\n\n139\n00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,185\nwith two arrows on it.\n\n140\n00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,635\nIf you click on that,\n\n141\n00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:36,203\nthat let's you extract your\nconfigs to a different directory.\n\n142\n00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:40,125\nIf you wanna back up the configs alone,\nnot the whole topology, just the configs,\n\n143\n00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:45,485\nyou can use this, and you can extract\nthose, or import configs from a directory.\n\n144\n00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:49,220\nYou might have one topology,\nwe have ten different labs for it.\n\n145\n00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,680\nSo ten different sets of configs you\nmight wanna start up with and so\n\n146\n00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,660\nyou would import your configs from a\ndirectory and specify that directory would\n\n147\n00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,360\nload all the configs and\nnow you're ready to start that lab.\n\n148\n00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,420\nI did that when I was studying for\nsome of my exams.\n\n149\n00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,880\nI built one very complex topology, but I\nhad a bunch of different sets of configs I\n\n150\n00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,210\nwould load based on what\nlab I wanted to do.\n\n151\n00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,940\nSo kinda a neat functionality\nthere using the two arrow button.\n\n152\n00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,160\nThat'll do all the configs for\nthe routers.\n\n153\n00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,910\nYou can do it on an individual router too.\n\n154\n00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,630\nIf you right click on it, you've got a few\noptions in there to be able to mess around\n\n155\n00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,990\nwith it if you go under configure.\n\n156\n00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,610\nBut for the most part, we do it as a whole\ncuz it's our full lab environment.\n\n157\n00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,750\nAll right well that's about it for saving.\n\n158\n00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,040\nI know a whole video on something as\nsimple as saving but it is important.\n\n159\n00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,020\nSo I hoped that helped you guys.\n\n160\n00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,410\nStay tuned we've got other videos on GNS3.\n\n161\n00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,200\nIf you haven't watched the other ones,\nmake sure you check them out.\n\n162\n00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,510\nWe've got a lot of features to cover and\nthey're all kinda covered in this section.\n\n163\n00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,430\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n164\n00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,990\nThey are there for you.\n\n165\n00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,973\nHope you guys enjoy it and\nI'll see you in the next video.\n\n166\n00:08:48,973 -->
