          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,071\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:13,095\nFor many organizations setting up\ncollaboration software, document editing,\n\n3\n00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:18,950\nspreadsheet software, and online storage\nis a really very difficult undertaking.\n\n4\n00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370\nAnd that's where organizations like Google\nhave stepped in to provide products like\n\n5\n00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,470\nGoogle Apps that make you not\nhave to reinvent the wheel.\n\n6\n00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,250\nGoogle Apps is a well-rounded\nsuite of software and\n\n7\n00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,550\nonline services that provides the needs\nfor most small and medium organizations.\n\n8\n00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,190\nI say, small and medium,\nreally large and enterprise too.\n\n9\n00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,190\nThere are enterprise customers with\nGoogle that have hundreds of thousands of\n\n10\n00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,510\nemployees all using solely Google Apps\naccounts, it's really impressive.\n\n11\n00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,090\nWith Google Apps,\nyou get a full office suite,\n\n12\n00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,390\nyou get the ability to do spreadsheets,\ndocuments,\n\n13\n00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,150\nslide presentations, all within an online\nhosted application environment,\n\n14\n00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,240\nwhich means no software needs\nto be installed on the client.\n\n15\n00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,393\nIn addition to that, you get shared\nstorage through Google Drive,\n\n16\n00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:09,449\nyou get group mailing lists, calendaring,\nall sorts of additional functionality.\n\n17\n00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:13,808\nAnd really the best part of it is that it\nis all hosted on Google state of the art\n\n18\n00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:18,713\ndata centers, so you don't have to back it\nup, you don't have to pay the power bill,\n\n19\n00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,890\nyou don't have to manage the resources for\nthat.\n\n20\n00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,370\nIt's all done for you at a per user\nlicense fee that you can adapt as\n\n21\n00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,910\nyour company shrinks and grows, so it is\na great solution for a lot of companies.\n\n22\n00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,460\nThe challenge though, is getting it\nset up, and getting your feet wet.\n\n23\n00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,540\nFor a lot of people this\nis a new way to think.\n\n24\n00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,570\nA lot of us are stuck in the old\nparadigm of you buy a desktop,\n\n25\n00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,160\nyou install your software right there,\nand you're done.\n\n26\n00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,680\nNow, we're transitioning it off, so\nthat the desktop doesn't matter anymore.\n\n27\n00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,590\nYou could be on your laptop, your cell\nphone, your desktop PC, your desktop Mac,\n\n28\n00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,690\na Linux machine, doesn't matter, and you\ncan access the same exact software, and\n\n29\n00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,280\nthe same exact resources\nwithout installing anything\n\n30\n00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,860\naside from a web browser\non your workstation.\n\n31\n00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,127\nSo, really handy, really neat technology,\n\n32\n00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,400\nand a lot of organizations\nare going that way.\n\n33\n00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,981\nITProTV, when we first started to form our\ncompany, Edutainment Live, we decided,\n\n34\n00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:14,723\nlet's go with Google Apps,\nbecause we don't need the infrastructure,\n\n35\n00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:20,730\nwe need to focus on creating shows, not\nfocus on managing our own document system.\n\n36\n00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,100\nSo, that's a great solution for\na lot of organizations, and\n\n37\n00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,470\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe covering in this show.\n\n38\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,650\nNow, when we set out to do this show,\nit was just gonna be a skills show.\n\n39\n00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,120\nA how to use Google Apps in your\norganization, but during the planning\n\n40\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,690\nprocess of our show, we were talking to\nsome of the guys that are at Google, and\n\n41\n00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,730\nthey informed us of a new\ncertification they were releasing.\n\n42\n00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,230\nWhich is the Google Apps\ncertified administrator, so\n\n43\n00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,560\nthey now have an administrator\ncertification that's available.\n\n44\n00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,605\nYou can go and show your knowledge\nof working with Google Apps,\n\n45\n00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,708\nit's supposed to be the equivalent\nof working, they say here,\n\n46\n00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,479\nsix months of experience managing 50,\nor more users.\n\n47\n00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,654\nIt's kind of a what the certification\nshows, and you can take their exam, and\n\n48\n00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:05,150\nwhen you pass, you're a Google Apps\ncertified administrator.\n\n49\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,960\nYou can show people that\nyou have that knowledge, so\n\n50\n00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,010\nit was really excellent timing.\n\n51\n00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,490\nWe got a chance to see the exam\nwhile it was in beta, and\n\n52\n00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,820\nnow we're gonna produce\nthe show built around it.\n\n53\n00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,510\nSo, our general skill show has\nactually become a certification show,\n\n54\n00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,800\nit's kinda neat that happened and\nall, it kinda just fell into place.\n\n55\n00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,560\nI'll post the link to this website with\nthe show notes, you get a chance to see\n\n56\n00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,560\nthose, but basically, what it is\nis a certification that just shows\n\n57\n00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,090\nyou have the know how to setup, and\noperate a Google Apps environment.\n\n58\n00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,420\nThe things that a company is going\nto need to know, things like\n\n59\n00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,390\nadding user accounts and removing\nuser accounts, managing Google Drive,\n\n60\n00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,090\nmanaging security, all the other\npieces inside of Google Apps.\n\n61\n00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610\nIt's important stuff to know, and\n\n62\n00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,820\nif you've not worked with this environment\nbefore, it's a great way to learn.\n\n63\n00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,070\nNow, if you wanna get the certification,\nsome of you don't,\n\n64\n00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,270\nsome of you just wanna learn how to\nuse Google apps, and that's great.\n\n65\n00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,980\nBut if you wanna get the certification,\n\n66\n00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,910\nit's a pretty straight forward process,\nthe test itself costs $100.\n\n67\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,800\nSo, it's not as high priced as some of\nthe other exams that are out there, but\n\n68\n00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,150\nthe part that I like best is that\nit's not a multiple choice exam.\n\n69\n00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,414\nInstead, it's a hands on practical exam,\nwhen you sign up for this,\n\n70\n00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:19,625\nyou're gonna be logging into\na temporary Google Apps environment.\n\n71\n00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,773\nAn account they've set up just for\nyou, and they'll give you a series of\n\n72\n00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:28,669\nscenario-based statements, not questions,\nreally like config documentation,\n\n73\n00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,021\nsaying we need you to set up this\norganization and these sub organizations,\n\n74\n00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:37,610\nand make sure you set this password\npolicy for this organization.\n\n75\n00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,100\nSo, they're telling you what to do,\nand then you do it, you log in and\n\n76\n00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,280\nyou actually get in there and\n\n77\n00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,870\nwork with the software to put\nthe configuration in place.\n\n78\n00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,230\nNow, they don't care how you do it,\nwhen you're done, when you submit that\n\n79\n00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,240\nexam to be graded, they run some scripts\nto look at what's the final product.\n\n80\n00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,330\nThey don't care, which way you achieved\nyour goal, they just care about the goal.\n\n81\n00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,170\nIf they ask you to set a password policy,\nand you use the GUI to do it, wonderful,\n\n82\n00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,450\nif you used an API call to do it,\nwonderful, they don't care.\n\n83\n00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,639\nBut a check to make sure that the end\nresult is what was right, and\n\n84\n00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,308\nthen if it is, you pass the exam.\n\n85\n00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:15,470\nSo, I really enjoyed that, that was\na breath of fresh air compared to other\n\n86\n00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,780\nexams that are multiple choice, or\ndrag and drop, or fake user interfaces.\n\n87\n00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,130\nI hate those, when they give you some\nkind of like flash animation, and\n\n88\n00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,850\nyou pretend like you're in the UI.\n\n89\n00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,390\nHere it's the actual product, really cool.\n\n90\n00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,840\nA little bit more about the exam,\nI said it's $100, and\n\n91\n00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,900\nit's a practical exam, you can take\nit from anywhere in the world.\n\n92\n00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,150\nYou don't have to go to testing center to\ndo it, you can take it from your own desk.\n\n93\n00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,160\nYou'll log in to an actual Google Apps\nenvironment that they built custom,\n\n94\n00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,750\njust for you.\n\n95\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,790\nIt's a two hour exam, so\nwhen you start the exam,\n\n96\n00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,230\nyou've got two hours to get it completed.\n\n97\n00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,320\nAnd when you're exam timer starts,\n\n98\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,960\nwhen you hit that Start button,\nyou'll get access to a Google Drive share\n\n99\n00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,880\nthat has a couple of documents in\nit that are telling you what to do.\n\n100\n00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,695\nAll the different actions\nthat you need to perform, and\n\n101\n00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,990\nthey're broken up into sections.\n\n102\n00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,160\nThey start with activities that\nmight take a long time to implement\n\n103\n00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,380\nbecause you've only got two hours, and\nyou need to get started on those first.\n\n104\n00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,630\nAnd then they break it up by section for\nother one's, so if you get hung up on\n\n105\n00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,370\nsomething and you can't do it, you can\nskip past it and work on other things.\n\n106\n00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,490\nSome of them are interrelated, but most of\nthem aren't, that way if you're stuck at\n\n107\n00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,340\none point, you don't just have to\ngive up on the rest of the exam and\n\n108\n00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,720\nfail, you can skip over it, work on\nthe other things, and come back later, and\n\n109\n00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800\ntry and\nfix that part that you were stuck on.\n\n110\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,170\nSo, that's kind of a nice thing too,\nbut you work on the environment and\n\n111\n00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,150\nwhen your two hours are up,\nyou lose access to your documents, and\n\n112\n00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,060\nyou lose access to the environment.\n\n113\n00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,050\nThey'll grade your exam right then,\nand you'll find out,\n\n114\n00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,350\nit's almost instantaneous that you'll\nfind out whether you passed or failed.\n\n115\n00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,089\nIt only takes a moment for\ntheir scripts to run to grade it.\n\n116\n00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,339\nNow, because the exam is done in\nan actual Google Apps environment,\n\n117\n00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,400\nit takes a little while\nto get that set up.\n\n118\n00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,750\nSo, when you register for\nthe exam, and you pay for it, and\n\n119\n00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,970\nyou schedule to take it,\nyou'll get a notice saying, hey,\n\n120\n00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,530\nit could take up to 48 hours to build\nthe environment, and get it ready for you.\n\n121\n00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,580\nSo, if you're planning on\ntaking the test tomorrow,\n\n122\n00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,270\nyou really should have signed up for\nit yesterday.\n\n123\n00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,600\nSo, don't expect to be able to take\nthe test the same day that you\n\n124\n00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720\nregister for it.\n\n125\n00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,220\nIt could take up to 48 hours now,\n\n126\n00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,870\nI'll tell you from my experience,\nit's usually much less.\n\n127\n00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,280\nI think it took about four hours for\nme, so it was ready pretty quickly, but\n\n128\n00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,650\ndon't bank on that,\nit depends on how busy they are and\n\n129\n00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,590\nhow much activity is in the system.\n\n130\n00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,320\nSo, if you wanna take the exam on Monday,\nyou should probably register for\n\n131\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,690\nit on a Saturday,\nthat way you know it'll be ready.\n\n132\n00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,140\nNow, once it's ready,\nyou have a window of time,\n\n133\n00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,660\nI believe it's seven days or,\ndo I have that written down?\n\n134\n00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,930\nI don't.\nI believe it's seven days to actually take\n\n135\n00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,020\nthe exam, and\n\n136\n00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,140\nwhen you click the start button,\nthat's when your two hour window starts.\n\n137\n00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,980\nNow, you might get disconnected,\nduring my exam I actually did\n\n138\n00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,200\nget disconnected at one point,\nmy user credentials stopped working.\n\n139\n00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,910\nI had to just log out and log back in,\nand it remembers exactly where you were.\n\n140\n00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,940\nIt's Google Apps,\n\n141\n00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,800\nyou don't lose your settings just\nbecause you got disconnected.\n\n142\n00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,060\nSo, don't worry about that, but\nif you do get disconnected,\n\n143\n00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,300\nyou still have that two hour\nwindow that you're operating in.\n\n144\n00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,820\nSo, just because you got disconnected,\ndoesn't mean the timer has stopped\n\n145\n00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,395\nrunning, you need to get back in there as\nquickly as you can, and continue working.\n\n146\n00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,228\nNow, during the exam, you have all\nthe tools that you would normally have\n\n147\n00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,277\nat your disposal, you're in a web browser.\n\n148\n00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:28,749\nSo, if you forget how to do something\nyou can pull the documentation up, and\n\n149\n00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:29,410\nfind out how.\n\n150\n00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,971\nThat sounds great, the easiest exam ever,\nit's open book, but\n\n151\n00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,885\nthe amount of time you spend searching for\nan answer,\n\n152\n00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,420\ncould be the difference between\nyou passing in failing.\n\n153\n00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,010\nIf you know how to do something, you can\njump right to it, and answer it, and\n\n154\n00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,020\nyou're in business.\n\n155\n00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,920\nIf you're looking in\nthe help documentation,\n\n156\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,410\nyou'll likely run out of time, so\ndon't rely on that as a crutch,\n\n157\n00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,340\nyou wanna make sure you're ready for\nthe topics.\n\n158\n00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,620\nThe only real requirement for your PC,\nbecause you can be on a Mac, or\n\n159\n00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,850\na Windows machine, or whatever,\nthey do require you to have a web camera.\n\n160\n00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,940\nDuring the exam it'll take your picture,\n\n161\n00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,390\nright at the beginning of the exam,\nand throughout the exam it'll take\n\n162\n00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,620\nrandom pictures to ensure that\nyou're the person taking the test.\n\n163\n00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,320\nSo, you do need a web camera to take it,\n\n164\n00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,290\nbut other than that you just need a web\nbrowser, preferably Google Chrome, and\n\n165\n00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,720\nyou can log in, take the exam,\nand do everything that you need.\n\n166\n00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,101\nSo, that's a little bit about the exam,\nonce you've signed up and you take it,\n\n167\n00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:27,546\nyou pass, and you'll get certificates\nin the mail a few days later, but\n\n168\n00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:30,963\nyou get immediate notification that\nyou pass, so really nice to have.\n\n169\n00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:34,124\nIf for some reason you don't\npass on the first attempt,\n\n170\n00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:38,629\nthen you have to wait 14 days in between\nattempts, so basically, two weeks,\n\n171\n00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,690\nif you fail, you've got to wait two\nweeks to be able to repeat the exam.\n\n172\n00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,660\nThat's really about it for\n\n173\n00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,490\nrequirements on the exam,\nit does cover a wide breadth of topics.\n\n174\n00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,790\nYou'll see they have the Administrator\nExam FAQ right here, where they layout\n\n175\n00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,980\nsome basic information here, which is\nbasically what I was just talking about.\n\n176\n00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,030\nBut there's also\nthe Administrator Study Guide, and\n\n177\n00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,180\nthis shows you everything\nthat's on the exam.\n\n178\n00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,820\nIt starts out with managing user accounts,\nthat accounts for 23% of the exam.\n\n179\n00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,020\nYou'll see organizational units,\nwhich are only about 10% of the exam.\n\n180\n00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,960\nGoogle App service and\norganizational access,\n\n181\n00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,700\nso which services you allow to be\nused by your users, that's 14%.\n\n182\n00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,649\nMail delivery routing and filtering,\nyou'll learn about spam filtering, and\n\n183\n00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,504\ne-mail domain attachment,\nand so on, that's 18%.\n\n184\n00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,850\nCalendar setting are 7%.\n\n185\n00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,508\nMobile policies, that's getting to be\na real important thing for businesses,\n\n186\n00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,430\nthat's 8%.\n\n187\n00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,260\nAnd then lastly, sorry not lastly.\n\n188\n00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,390\nThen we've got security,\nwhich is 10% and groups.\n\n189\n00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,170\nI said lastly cuz I always think\nof groups as part of security.\n\n190\n00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,790\nBut security and groups are the remaining\n10% there, is what the exam covers.\n\n191\n00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,410\nThey are very open about this.\n\n192\n00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,890\nThis exam study guide is\nreally all you need to study.\n\n193\n00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,740\nEvery question,\n\n194\n00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,508\neverything that they ask you to do on\nthe exam is right here in the guide.\n\n195\n00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:01,840\nIf you wanna learn about deploying users,\nyou can come in, and pull this up, and\n\n196\n00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,570\nit will show all the different\nways that we can add users, and\n\n197\n00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,570\nyou can read through that documentation.\n\n198\n00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,270\nHere on the show what we're doing is that\nwe're turning that into a concise format,\n\n199\n00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,520\nso you can watch instead of having\nto read through page after page.\n\n200\n00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,310\nAnd so during the course of the show I'll\ndemonstrate how to do all these things.\n\n201\n00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,930\nI'll show you where to go in Google apps,\nand how to configure and\n\n202\n00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,280\nmodify these settings, and\n\n203\n00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,790\nhow to get them put in place in different\nscenarios, but it's all right here.\n\n204\n00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,510\nSo, this is really a nice certification in\nthat the material right here is available,\n\n205\n00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,860\nthey're very honest about what's gonna\nbe on the exam, it's all right here.\n\n206\n00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,784\nIt's pretty pleasant experience compared\nto some of the other vendors that\n\n207\n00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:38,385\nare out there.\n\n208\n00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,224\nNow, if you wanna practice\nto get ready for this exam,\n\n209\n00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:45,300\nyou know from the administrator guide\nthe topics that are gonna be on there, so\n\n210\n00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,870\nyou know the type of stuff\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n211\n00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,796\nThese maybe things that you're not used\nto, you haven't worked with before,\n\n212\n00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:55,898\nmaybe you haven't worked with Google Apps\nbefore, or maybe you have Google Apps in\n\n213\n00:11:55,898 --> 00:12:00,390\nyour company but you haven't used some\nof the features they're talking about.\n\n214\n00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,470\nWell, you don't want to mess with\nyour production environment,\n\n215\n00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,500\ndon't mess with your company's Google Apps\naccount, instead you can sign up for\n\n216\n00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,350\na demo account, Google does a 30\nday free trial of Google Apps.\n\n217\n00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,750\nYou can sign up for it, and you'll have 30\ndays access to a Google Apps environment,\n\n218\n00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,050\nto be able to jump in and work with,\nto experiment, and practice.\n\n219\n00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,886\nSo, if you want one, and I'll post\nthe link to this with the show also.\n\n220\n00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,889\nYou can go the Google Apps for Enterprise\nbusinesses, and you can go in there and\n\n221\n00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,592\nstart a free trial, that'll have\nthe 30 day free trial that you can do,\n\n222\n00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:36,458\nno commitment, you don't even have to\nput in payment information to do it.\n\n223\n00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,340\nSo, there's really no reason not\nto sign up for one of these.\n\n224\n00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,100\nThey give you a trial environment\nwhere you can experiment with all of\n\n225\n00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100\nthe different things that\nmight be on the exam.\n\n226\n00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100\nAll you have to do is click\nStart Free Trial, and\n\n227\n00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,680\nit'll ask you to punch in\nan existing email address.\n\n228\n00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,730\nAnd then you can specify what domain\nyou want to use, so for example,\n\n229\n00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,550\nhere with this one, it's asking me\nto put in first name, last name, and\n\n230\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,480\nI'm gonna put in Don Pezet,\nhere I'll be don@ITproTV,\n\n231\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,230\nand then it says,\nwhat your business organization is.\n\n232\n00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,550\nSo, maybe I'll call this the ITProTV Lab.\n\n233\n00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,015\nNumber of employees, I'll say two to nine,\nyou don't really need more.\n\n234\n00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,140\nYou do need to put a phone number in for\nthem to be able to contact you,\n\n235\n00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,970\nso I'll put in my office number.\n\n236\n00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,370\nThen it's gonna ask you whether\nwe're gonna use a domain address\n\n237\n00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,330\nthat we already have, or\none that we're gonna buy.\n\n238\n00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,070\nSince this is just a trial, you probably,\ndon't wanna buy a domain just for\n\n239\n00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,990\nyour trial.\n\n240\n00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,509\nSo, you may choose to use a domain\nname you've already got, and\n\n241\n00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,357\nyou punch it in here.\n\n242\n00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,924\nSo, I'm gonna say, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n243\n00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:42,593\nSo, that's gonna be the domain\nthat I use for this, and\n\n244\n00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:46,000\nyou can really put in\nwhatever you want there.\n\n245\n00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,950\nIf you put in some fake domain\nthat you don't own, that's okay,\n\n246\n00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,350\nyou just won't be able to activate.\n\n247\n00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,230\nYou won't actually be able to\nget email service in it, but for\n\n248\n00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,860\nexperimenting with the topics that\nare on the exam, that's fine, or\n\n249\n00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,130\nif you did pick a domain you actually own,\nthen you can attach that to it.\n\n250\n00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,930\nAnd you'll be able to do email flow, and\nactually use the Google Apps account,\n\n251\n00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,379\nthat's a nice thing to be able to do.\n\n252\n00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,990\nSo, it's gonna ask me for a user name,\nI'll just punch in, I'll do dpezet, and\n\n253\n00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,250\na password to use for the site,\nso I'll punch in a password,\n\n254\n00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,280\nand then I've gotto pass their CAPTCHA\nwhich I don't know if you guys this.\n\n255\n00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,611\nI'm not exactly quite sure what that\nfirst letter is, that might be an x,\n\n256\n00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,975\nlet's just give that a shot.\n\n257\n00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:31,316\nThis is gonna be the most challenging\npart here, is just passing that.\n\n258\n00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:35,477\nI'll go ahead, and accept their agreement.\n\n259\n00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,719\nI got the CAPTCHA wrong.\n\n260\n00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,484\nLet's try it again.\n\n261\n00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:43,304\nThis been the longest segment of the show,\nright here,\n\n262\n00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:47,006\njust trying to get pass\nin the little test.\n\n263\n00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,098\nGotta love these CAPTCHA things.\n\n264\n00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:48,899\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,500\nSo, it's gonna create that account.\n\n266\n00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,660\nNow, while you're in a trial,\nit can work if you attach your domain.\n\n267\n00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,719\nYeah, my accounts for the other shows,\nso I need to switch accounts, but\n\n268\n00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,661\nI guess [INAUDIBLE] from the other show,\nso I need the switch account.\n\n269\n00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:04,393\nSo, I'm gonna log in as that account,\nlab.itpro.tv, and\n\n270\n00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,760\nI'll punch in that password.\n\n271\n00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,470\nThere we go, and [LAUGH] we've detected\nunusual activity on your account,\n\n272\n00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,150\nand that's just because I have logged\nin multiple times on this machine.\n\n273\n00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,900\nBut normally, you'll get pass that, and it\nwill take you right into your Google Apps\n\n274\n00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,615\nconsole, and\nyou're now set up with a 30 day account.\n\n275\n00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:27,270\nSo, I could punch in my account, and\ndo an automated call and verify it.\n\n276\n00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,900\nI won't make you guys wait through that.\n\n277\n00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,830\nBut basically, once you're logged in,\nyou'll be at your Google Apps console, and\n\n278\n00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,700\nyou'll have 30 days.\n\n279\n00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,470\nAt the end of 30 days,\nyour account will be disabled and\n\n280\n00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,810\nshut off, unless you put payment\ninformation, and start paying.\n\n281\n00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,570\nYou convert to a pay account,\nbut for just practicing for\n\n282\n00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,420\nthe exam, you just use it for\n30 days, then it goes away.\n\n283\n00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,120\nThat's actually, the exact thing they're\ndoing for your exam, when you do the real\n\n284\n00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800\nexam, and you're doing practical\nenvironment it's just a trial\n\n285\n00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,650\naccount basically, that's gonna run for\nthe few hours that your exam is active.\n\n286\n00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,030\nSo, easy to do, jump right in,\nget that set up with a trial, and\n\n287\n00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,590\nyou'll be ready to go for practicing.\n\n288\n00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,070\nIf your 30 days run up, you can\nalways set up another trial account.\n\n289\n00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,290\nI've already got one, actually,\nI think I've got two or three of them, so\n\n290\n00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,590\nthis would be a fourth one now,\n\n291\n00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,340\nwhich might be why it set off\nthe little phone number prompt there.\n\n292\n00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,960\nBut basically, you can get these set up,\nand go in and experiment.\n\n293\n00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,910\nIf you set up a bunch of them, they always\nworry about you maybe retransmitting spam\n\n294\n00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,630\nthrough them, which is why it'll start\nusing security measures like these.\n\n295\n00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,140\nBut that is basically, the Google\nAdministrator Processing, in a nutshell.\n\n296\n00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,460\nWhen it's done, you get certified.\n\n297\n00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,320\nYou're a Google Apps\nCertified Administrator.\n\n298\n00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,130\nYou can put that on your resume, and\nit shows people that you know how to\n\n299\n00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,450\nuse Google Apps, and that you've\ngot the knowledge to back it up,\n\n300\n00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,450\nthat you've been certified by Google,\nand you can do it.\n\n301\n00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,290\nIt's a great resource for small and\nmedium businesses, as well as enterprises.\n\n302\n00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,980\nIt really is neat software.\n\n303\n00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,570\nSomething that's\ndefinitely worth learning.\n\n304\n00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,140\nWell, that's about all I've got for\nour intro.\n\n305\n00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,940\nRemember if you ever have any questions,\nyou can ask.\n\n306\n00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,990\nLive during the show you\ncan go to ITPro.TV/Live and\n\n307\n00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,040\nthere's a chat box beneath the video.\n\n308\n00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,400\nIf you're watching this recorded, which I\nknow most of you do, you can use our Q and\n\n309\n00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,190\nA forums.\n\n310\n00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,410\nYou'll see a link that says Q and\nA at the top of every page.\n\n311\n00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,660\nIt'll take you to the forums and\nyou can post your questions there, and\n\n312\n00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,610\nwe'll get back to you from there.\n\n313\n00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,671\nBut yeah, if you have any questions,\nlet us know, otherwise,\n\n314\n00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:22,154\nI will see you during the show.\n\n315\n00:17:22,154

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,184\n[SOUND] Objective 1.1 covers how\n\n2\n00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:13,579\nto create new users inside\nof your Google Apps account.\n\n3\n00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:14,955\nWhen you setup your initial account,\n\n4\n00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,330\nit is not incredibly useful until\nyou get some users put in there.\n\n5\n00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,800\nSo this is a pretty important step for us.\n\n6\n00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,840\nThere's three different way to\ncreate new users in Google App but\n\n7\n00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,770\nit's all done through the same system.\n\n8\n00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,440\nIn fact, here let me just show you.\n\n9\n00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,050\nWhen I log in to my admin console, one of\nmy admin console icons is to create users.\n\n10\n00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,560\nAnd on a new account\nwhen you go in to users,\n\n11\n00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,630\nit's going to be mostly empty,\nyou'll see yourself in there,\n\n12\n00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,350\nyou've got an account as\nthe administrator that set it up.\n\n13\n00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,520\nBut that's it.\n\n14\n00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,530\nNow we need to get other users in there.\n\n15\n00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,480\nYou've got the add user icon\nup top which is a little\n\n16\n00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,980\nperson with a plus symbol by their head,\nthat's the icon.\n\n17\n00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,790\nAnd when we click on\nthat it's going to ask us\n\n18\n00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,060\nwhich of the three ways we want\nto use to create the user's.\n\n19\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,590\nThe most common method is the first\none which is to add a user manually.\n\n20\n00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,120\nWe just choose that option and\nhit Continue.\n\n21\n00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,930\nAnd we'll provide\ninformation about the user.\n\n22\n00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,830\nTo create a user account, Google Apps\nneeds four pieces of information.\n\n23\n00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,620\nThey need a first name, a last name,\nan email address, and a password.\n\n24\n00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,430\nAnd we'll see that over and over again.\n\n25\n00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,010\nNo matter which way you\ncreate the account,\n\n26\n00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,890\nthose are the four pieces\nof information you need.\n\n27\n00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,820\nFirst name, last name,\nemail address, password.\n\n28\n00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,890\nSo I can just punch that in here.\n\n29\n00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,760\nI'll create an account for\none of our other show hosts.\n\n30\n00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,100\nI'll do Ronnie Wong.\n\n31\n00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,490\nAll right, and\nI'll need to give him an email address, so\n\n32\n00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,550\nmaybe I'll do rwong@itpro.tv.net,\nso I'll punch that one in.\n\n33\n00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,548\nAnd then for the password, the default\nis to do a temporary password so\n\n34\n00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:41,840\nwe're just gonna automatically assign one.\n\n35\n00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,070\nAnd then we can do the password reset\noption to get a new password set on there,\n\n36\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,850\nor alternatively I can go in and\nset a password myself.\n\n37\n00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,420\nI can click on set a password.\n\n38\n00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,050\nAnd I can punch one in.\n\n39\n00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,400\nNow it's going to gauge the strength\nof that password to find out whether or\n\n40\n00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,610\nnot it's a strong password or a weak one.\n\n41\n00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,810\nYou can see I've typed in a weak password\nhere and it's not too happy about that.\n\n42\n00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,910\nIt will let you use it but\nit's not too happy about it.\n\n43\n00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,480\nIt's only if it fails completely,\n\n44\n00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,130\nif you get a red password that\nit will actually stop you.\n\n45\n00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,200\nSo let me just punch in a stronger\npassword for this user account.\n\n46\n00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,520\nAnd now you'll see as I use capital and\nlower case letters and so\n\n47\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,270\non, that the strength meter goes to green,\nletting me know that it is more secure.\n\n48\n00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,480\nSo we're kind of covered there, and\nnow I can take this password, and\n\n49\n00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,470\nI give it to that user.\n\n50\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,330\nThey can log in, and\nthey're in business, right?\n\n51\n00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,950\nWe can auto generate the password\nagain if we want to switch back, but\n\n52\n00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,400\nhere we at least know it.\n\n53\n00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,890\nNow technically that's all I need,\nI can hit Create User and\n\n54\n00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,080\nI'm done, but you might have more\ninformation for that user, and\n\n55\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,690\nif you do,\nyou can just hit Additional Info, and\n\n56\n00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,810\nyou can provide all the optional\ninformation that person might have.\n\n57\n00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,800\nThey might have more than\none email address, so\n\n58\n00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,250\nyou can list additional\nemail addresses here.\n\n59\n00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,270\nYou can enter in home phone numbers and\naddresses.\n\n60\n00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,480\nWork numbers and addresses,\nand mobile phone numbers.\n\n61\n00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,270\nWell I guess you wouldn't really have\na mobile address, that one's not there.\n\n62\n00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,080\nBut you can add in each of those, and\n\n63\n00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,950\nyou can do more than one by\nusing that add new button.\n\n64\n00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,720\nOn the last screen,\nyou've got employee details.\n\n65\n00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,390\nEmployee ID, type, title,\nmanager, and so on.\n\n66\n00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,220\nThis is all optional information.\n\n67\n00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,390\nIf you want to have it logged in, great.\n\n68\n00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,810\nIf you don't, you can leave it blank.\n\n69\n00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,050\nYou can always add it later,\nit's entirely up to you.\n\n70\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,220\nBut when you create user, the user\naccount get created in our system,\n\n71\n00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,970\nand then we'll see them\nappear here in our list.\n\n72\n00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,440\nSo now it's telling me the username,\nand what the new email address is.\n\n73\n00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,540\nAnd it's giving me the URL to share\nwith that user so that they can come and\n\n74\n00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,460\nlog in, and access the system.\n\n75\n00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,350\nAll right, so,\nthat method works pretty well, right?\n\n76\n00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,870\nBut it's not perfect.\n\n77\n00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,330\nAnd the main problem with it is if\nI have to create a ton of users.\n\n78\n00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,690\nWhat if I need to create\na hundred new user accounts?\n\n79\n00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,770\nI could run through that\nwizard a hundred times.\n\n80\n00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,280\nI'd have to have a lot\nof time on my hands, or\n\n81\n00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,380\nbe really bored, or\njust love monotonous work.\n\n82\n00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,790\nSome people do, but if we want to create\na large quantitative users at once\n\n83\n00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,850\nthat method's not too great for us.\n\n84\n00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,910\nBut when we hit that add user icon,\nyou'll see the other option.\n\n85\n00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,780\nAdd update several users at once.\n\n86\n00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,920\nGoogle Docs or Google Apps\nsupports being updated via a CSV.\n\n87\n00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,020\nA comma separative values sheet.\n\n88\n00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,770\nIt's basically a spreadsheet that\nis a very plain text simple format.\n\n89\n00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,510\nAlmost every spreadsheet\nsoftware out there supports it.\n\n90\n00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,060\nSo you can use Google Sheets to\ngenerate it right there inside of your\n\n91\n00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,210\nGoogle Apps account.\n\n92\n00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,535\nYou can use Microsoft Excel.\n\n93\n00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:27,820\nYou can use Lotus 123 for\nthat matter, even old software.\n\n94\n00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,840\nAlmost all spreadsheet software\nwill generate a CSV file, and\n\n95\n00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,930\nin that CSV file, you can list first name,\nlast name, email address and password.\n\n96\n00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,360\nThose four pieces of information, that's\nenough to get those accounts created.\n\n97\n00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,620\nYou can provide all the other information\ntoo, if you've got it, mailing address,\n\n98\n00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,360\nphone numbers, and so on.\n\n99\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,390\nThat CSV, you can make it yourself,\nif you want.\n\n100\n00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,150\nBut what I normally do is, if you hit\nContinue, it gives you the option to\n\n101\n00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,510\ndownload a CSV that's already formatted\nthe way that Google wants it, all right.\n\n102\n00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,970\nIf you download that,\nI'll go ahead and download this one.\n\n103\n00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,480\nSo I'm going to download that and\nsave it to my drive.\n\n104\n00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,030\nWhen I open that up,\nit's just a blank CSV, and it's got\n\n105\n00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,770\nall the different fields that I need\nright there across the top of the screen.\n\n106\n00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,480\nLet me zoom on that so\nwe can actually see what's going on here.\n\n107\n00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,640\nSo I've got first name, last name,\nemail address, and so on.\n\n108\n00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,770\nI just type all that in for my users.\n\n109\n00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,540\nI might already have these employees\nlogged in another system and\n\n110\n00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,710\nI can just export them and bring them\nall right in here one fell swoop.\n\n111\n00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,800\nYou can also use this\nto update your users.\n\n112\n00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,420\nIf you wanna change the users\nthat are already in the system.\n\n113\n00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,150\nI had that check box back there,\nI didn't hit it, but\n\n114\n00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,110\nI had this pre populate\nwith existing users.\n\n115\n00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,720\nIf you check that it'll put\nall your existing user data\n\n116\n00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,680\nin there with the exception of passwords,\nright, it leaves that blank.\n\n117\n00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,412\nAnd then you can modify it,\nand import it back in.\n\n118\n00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:51,400\nNow you can make bulk changes to\nyour users and do it very rapidly.\n\n119\n00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360\nIt's kinda a nice thing.\n\n120\n00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,700\nI know a lot of people might want to add\na secondary email address after the fact,\n\n121\n00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,540\nand if you've already got 100 users,\nthen you don't wanna have to go and\n\n122\n00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,930\nedit each one individually.\n\n123\n00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,050\nSo you can use that pre-populate\noption to take care of that.\n\n124\n00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,720\nAll right?\n\n125\n00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,510\nNow I've got a CSV file sitting\nover here called users.csv.\n\n126\n00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,370\nI generated this before the show,\nand it just has a handful of users.\n\n127\n00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,800\nAnd so I've got their first name, last\nname, email address, and passwords for\n\n128\n00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,790\nthe system.\n\n129\n00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,800\nNow for the passwords I chose semi-random\npasswords that mix capital letters,\n\n130\n00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,660\nlowercase letters, and so\non to pre-populate that so\n\n131\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,180\nI can load it in the system.\n\n132\n00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,350\nA lot of people will pick one standard\npassword and give that to their users and\n\n133\n00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,160\nsay, hey when you log in you\nneed to reset your password.\n\n134\n00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520\nThe problem with that is if one user sees,\nhey my passwords 1234,\n\n135\n00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,850\nI bet somebody else's is.\n\n136\n00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,020\nAnd if they wanted they could start trying\nto log in as other users until they find\n\n137\n00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,770\nsomebody who hasn't logged in yet\nand take over that account.\n\n138\n00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,140\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n139\n00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,970\nSo it's better to generate dynamic\npasswords like these, different for\n\n140\n00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,790\neach user,\nthat you then distribute to the users.\n\n141\n00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,500\nAnd you still make them\nreset their password.\n\n142\n00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,990\nMake them change their password\nwhen they log in because\n\n143\n00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,950\nif somebody gets a hold of this\nspreadsheet you're in hot water, right?\n\n144\n00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,050\nNow for those random passwords,\nyou can generate them any number of ways.\n\n145\n00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,800\nThe way that I like to use is if\nyou go to the website random.org,\n\n146\n00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,970\nit's a website that specifies\nin generating random data.\n\n147\n00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,660\nAnd so they have got all sorta of junk in\nhere for games and lotteries and so on.\n\n148\n00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,690\nBut if you scroll down a bit,\n\n149\n00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,650\nyou'll find in here where\nthey've got one for passwords.\n\n150\n00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,400\nI always miss it here on this screen.\n\n151\n00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,270\nLet me just search for password.\n\n152\n00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,980\nThere it is.\n\n153\n00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,270\nUnder Lists and Strings,\nwe've got password generator.\n\n154\n00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,550\nAnd so you can go in there and tell it hey\nI need to generate 50 random passwords\n\n155\n00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,800\nthat are say ten characters each, and\nhit Get, and it'll generate those and\n\n156\n00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,810\nyou can just copy and\npaste this right into your spreadsheet and\n\n157\n00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,790\nthere's some dynamic password for\nyou to use.\n\n158\n00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,799\nA great way to like seed a CSV file to\nalready have that information in there.\n\n159\n00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,020\nAll right, but\nonce we have got that CSV developed,\n\n160\n00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,030\nall we have to do is go in here and choose\nto attach a file, and notice this option.\n\n161\n00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,110\nRequire user to change\npassword at next sign-in.\n\n162\n00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,100\nThat is what we want.\n\n163\n00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,950\nWe'll give them this temporary password\nthat we set and the first time they login,\n\n164\n00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,530\nthey are going to have to\nchange their password.\n\n165\n00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,519\nSo I will go in and\nattach that CSV that I made.\n\n166\n00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,820\nWhich I've got buried away in\nhere somewhere in my show notes.\n\n167\n00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,700\nLet me just find that real quick.\n\n168\n00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,860\nAnd we'll import it and it will create\nall of those users in one big fell swoop\n\n169\n00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,110\nwhich does make life a heck\nof a lot easier on us.\n\n170\n00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,410\nSo I'll go ahead to\nchoose to bring that in.\n\n171\n00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,430\nI'm going to leave the check mark to\nrequire users to change their passwords.\n\n172\n00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,040\nAnd we'll upload it.\n\n173\n00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,570\nNow it says that it's adding six users.\n\n174\n00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,190\nIt's not actually done, right.\n\n175\n00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,720\nSo it's going to run and it says it\nwill email me when it's complete.\n\n176\n00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,930\nI'll get an email at this address\nletting me know the users are complete.\n\n177\n00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,430\nIt usually doesn't take very long, but\nthe more accounts you're importing,\n\n178\n00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,980\nthe longer this can take.\n\n179\n00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,110\nSo you can wait for that email or you can\njust sit here and refresh this screen.\n\n180\n00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,170\nAnd eventually you'll see all\nthe additional users start to appear.\n\n181\n00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,290\nSo there they go.\n\n182\n00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,060\nI can see all the users that I just\nimported in addition to myself.\n\n183\n00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,410\nNow they all say never logged\nin because they're new accounts.\n\n184\n00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,630\nThey haven't logged in.\n\n185\n00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,260\nI need to go and give them their new user\nname and password and the URL to go to.\n\n186\n00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,149\nAnd the first time they log in,\nthey'll punch in that new password.\n\n187\n00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,060\nAll right, so we've seen manual creation\nof user accounts, and we've seen creation\n\n188\n00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,460\nof the user accounts using a CSV,\npretty straightforward, all right.\n\n189\n00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,890\nThere is a third method for creating user\naccount, and that's to send an invitation.\n\n190\n00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,830\nIf I hit the little plus\nsign here on the user and\n\n191\n00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,430\nchoose invite users,\nmy third option, all right.\n\n192\n00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,640\nThis is useful if the users already\nhave an email address somewhere else.\n\n193\n00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,190\nWe can choose to send them an invite\nat their current email address.\n\n194\n00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,210\nAnd they can click on that invite and\nit will let them pick their password,\n\n195\n00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,320\nand put in their own information.\n\n196\n00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,350\nSo instead of having to know it\nahead of time and have us enter it,\n\n197\n00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,650\nwhere we might make mistakes,\nwe can have them enter it themselves.\n\n198\n00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,320\nAll right?\nSo\n\n199\n00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,830\nit definitely takes a little\nbit of burden off of us.\n\n200\n00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,200\nTo invite a user, the only thing\nyou need is their email address.\n\n201\n00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,010\nSo you pick who it is that you want to\ninvite and you send them an invitation.\n\n202\n00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,910\nSo I could invite, here,\n\n203\n00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,460\nI'll do nate@itpro.tv,\none of our other show hosts.\n\n204\n00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,030\nSo I'll invite him and\nwhen I hit Continue,\n\n205\n00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,370\nit's going to show me the invitation\nthat it's going to send him.\n\n206\n00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,880\nJust a simple message saying,\n\n207\n00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,770\nhey, I'm inviting you to use\nthe Google Apps one, right.\n\n208\n00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,850\nSo I'll just say here, oh, actually it\n\n209\n00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,540\nwon't let me modify it here, you have to\nmodify in your main applications settings.\n\n210\n00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,700\nBut basically, it's got this generic\nlittle template here that it's gonna send,\n\n211\n00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,950\nand I'll send that along, and\nnow Nate's gonna get an email.\n\n212\n00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,650\nWhen he gets it,\nhe'll be able to click on a link and\n\n213\n00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,630\ncreate his own account,\nspecifying his password at that time.\n\n214\n00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,194\nSo now there's no messing around with\ntemporary passwords, that's a good thing,\n\n215\n00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,070\nthat's a positive side of this.\n\n216\n00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,890\nOn a negative side he's got\nto have an existing email\n\n217\n00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,950\naccount to be able to send to, but I think\nmost people have that at this point so\n\n218\n00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,660\nthat's probably something very doable.\n\n219\n00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,200\nAll right, so those are the three\nmethods for creating that account.\n\n220\n00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,940\nWe've got our manually creating\nthem individual user accounts,\n\n221\n00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,710\ncreating them with a CSV in bulk,\nor sending an invitation.\n\n222\n00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,630\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of creating users.\n\n223\n00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,645\nStay tuned we've got more\ntopics coming up after this.\n\n224\n00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:18,364\n[SOUND].\n\n",

is demonstrate how\nto rename users, move users, add or\n\n4\n00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,360\nremove nicknames, and suspend users.\n\n5\n00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,470\nIt's a lot, right?\n\n6\n00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,390\nThese are basically the day to day\nactivities that we'll have deal with as we\n\n7\n00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,320\nwork with our user accounts\nonce they've been created.\n\n8\n00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,250\nSo, let's just break\nthis down piece by piece.\n\n9\n00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,140\nThe first one is renaming a user.\n\n10\n00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,720\nNow, there's a lot of different scenarios\nwhere we might need to rename a user.\n\n11\n00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,780\nMaybe there was a typo made\nwhen the user was entered in.\n\n12\n00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,460\nMaybe you have a person whose name has\nchanged, you have that through marriage or\n\n13\n00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,910\ndivorce, other things like that that\nmight result in user's name changing.\n\n14\n00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,780\nSo in those scenarios we need\nto come in and modify it.\n\n15\n00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,507\nThe most common scenario for\nme is where you hire somebody and\n\n16\n00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,694\nyou know their full name.\n\n17\n00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,192\nBut then you find out that\nthey usually use a nickname,\n\n18\n00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,852\na shortened version of their name and\nso you want to go in and\n\n19\n00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:58,040\nchange their account to reflect\nthat shortened version.\n\n20\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,690\nWhatever the reason it's\nall done the same way.\n\n21\n00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,253\nThere's actually a couple of different\nways we could go about renaming a user.\n\n22\n00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:07,459\nThe most common way is if we\njust go into our users list,\n\n23\n00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:11,363\nwe can pull up our list of users and\nif you just float over somebody so\n\n24\n00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,500\nif I float over like Chris Poland here,\nI'll float over him.\n\n25\n00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,600\nAnd when you float over the user name,\nyou'll see a window pop up\n\n26\n00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,730\nthat has their basic contact details and\nincludes a rename link.\n\n27\n00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,432\nAnd I can choose Rename and\nmaybe I wanna make him Christopher.\n\n28\n00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:28,996\nRight?\nSo I'll punch in Christopher as the name.\n\n29\n00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:32,760\nYou'll see where I can change\nthe primary email address also.\n\n30\n00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,830\nYou probably don't wanna change that.\n\n31\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,490\nIf they've been handing out their\nemail address to other people, well,\n\n32\n00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,260\nyou don't want their\nemail address to change.\n\n33\n00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,550\nPeople are gonna have a bad\nemail in their contacts.\n\n34\n00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,380\nSo instead, if we wanna do additional\nnames there, we may want to attach\n\n35\n00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,390\nan alias, which we'll take\na look at here in a few moments.\n\n36\n00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,170\nBut here, I can punch this in.\n\n37\n00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,420\nI've got their full name in,\nand I can hit rename user.\n\n38\n00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,210\nSo that's one way to go about it, right?\n\n39\n00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,646\nAnother way would be to actually click\non the user and, if we browse into\n\n40\n00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:03,870\nthe user page for Christopher Poland here,\nI can see his account.\n\n41\n00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,755\nI can see his basic information and\nyou can click on account and\n\n42\n00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:10,530\nyou'll see basic information right here.\n\n43\n00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,410\nSo I see the name and\nemail address and if you hit edit,\n\n44\n00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,806\nthe screen's a little bit different but\nit's the same thing.\n\n45\n00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,804\nIt's using that rename\nscreen from earlier.\n\n46\n00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,300\nSo here, I could put him\nback to being Chris Poland.\n\n47\n00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,390\nThere we go.\n\n48\n00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,776\nAnd I can update that user,\nand there it is.\n\n49\n00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,120\nNow, they've got the new name.\n\n50\n00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,833\nNotice how my screen hasn't\nrefreshed to show it.\n\n51\n00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,740\nIt does take a moment for\nthe screens to refresh.\n\n52\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,341\nIt's usually easier just to go\nback out to our user list, and\n\n53\n00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,962\nwe'll see that it's already updated there,\nand if I go back into the user account,\n\n54\n00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:40,049\nit's updated, right?\n\n55\n00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,937\nSo, your screen might not refresh right\naway, but the change did take effect.\n\n56\n00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,820\nSo, that's renaming a user.\n\n57\n00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,230\nThe next thing that they\ncall out is moving a user.\n\n58\n00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,610\nI did a bulk import in an earlier import\nto bring all of these user accounts in.\n\n59\n00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,980\nWhen you import your users,\nthey all end up in your main organization.\n\n60\n00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,708\nNow a lot of companies just\nuse one organization, so\n\n61\n00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,199\nwe don't worry about that.\n\n62\n00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,570\nThere's no need to move the users.\n\n63\n00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,807\nBut if you have more\nthan one organization,\n\n64\n00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,356\nyou might need to move\nusers to different places.\n\n65\n00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,412\nNotice here in my company,\non the right side I've got,\n\n66\n00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:18,289\nhere, I'll just move this over a little\nbit, I've got organization, itprotv.net,\n\n67\n00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,110\nand underneath it,\nI have a suborganization called Retired.\n\n68\n00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,724\nThis is where I move my employees that\nhave retired off to so they're not active\n\n69\n00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:29,523\nin the company anymore but I still want to\nkeep their account for various reasons.\n\n70\n00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,350\nMaybe I still provide email\nservice to them but nothing else.\n\n71\n00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,680\nSo I wanna move then to\nthat sub-organization.\n\n72\n00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,058\nWhen you create user accounts like this,\nespecially with a bulk import,\n\n73\n00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:40,975\nthey just go into our main organization.\n\n74\n00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,160\nThat's where they are.\n\n75\n00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,060\nWell, when you take a look at a user,\nand you float over them,\n\n76\n00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,290\nyou don't really see any\noption to move the user.\n\n77\n00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,743\nIt's a little bit strange but\nif you click by user,\n\n78\n00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:55,132\nyou'll see some new buttons\nappear up at the top.\n\n79\n00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:58,900\nAnd that's where you start to see things\nlike move to another organization.\n\n80\n00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,640\nIt's a little picture of a person\nwith an arrow on it letting\n\n81\n00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,550\nyou know you're gonna\nmove them somewhere else.\n\n82\n00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,140\nThe nice part about this is you\ncan pick more than one user.\n\n83\n00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,200\nAnd so we can just go down the list and\npick people that we want to move off.\n\n84\n00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,470\nAnd you can hit move, and\n\n85\n00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,505\nthen it'll let you pick from the various\norganizations and sub-organizations.\n\n86\n00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,420\nAllright, if you didn't have any\nsub-organizations you can actually see\n\n87\n00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,870\nwhere you can create new ones right here,\nbut\n\n88\n00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,010\nwe'll talk about that in another segment.\n\n89\n00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,296\nI'm gonna move them off to this\nretired one, I'll hit OK, and\n\n90\n00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,973\nthat's gonna move them along.\n\n91\n00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,360\nMoving users in bulk is really\neasy from the user list.\n\n92\n00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,050\nYou can also do it from\nthe individual user.\n\n93\n00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,220\nSo if I pull up Ronnie's page,\n\n94\n00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,590\nwhen I go in to Ronnie's account you'll\nsee I've got the move icon right there.\n\n95\n00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,039\nSo if I'm just moving one user, I can do\nit right from inside of their account.\n\n96\n00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,980\nWhatever works for you guys,\nwhere you happen to be at that point.\n\n97\n00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,039\nThe end result is the same.\n\n98\n00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,330\nAll right the next little chore\nin our list is a nickname.\n\n99\n00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,830\nRight.\n\n100\n00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,650\nWe'll use Ronnie here as an example.\n\n101\n00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,440\nSo Ronnie is Ronnie Wong, but\nhis full name is actually Ronald.\n\n102\n00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,330\nI don't think I've ever called\nhim Ronald in his entire life.\n\n103\n00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,660\nOr in the time I've known him at least.\n\n104\n00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,570\nBut that is his full name.\n\n105\n00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,240\nSo he has two names.\n\n106\n00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,290\nRonnie, that he goes by and\nRonald, that is his actual name.\n\n107\n00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,400\nI might want him to have more\nthan one name in my system.\n\n108\n00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,672\nNow as far as what's displayed on the\nscreen, we don't normally worry too much\n\n109\n00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:21,200\nabout that, that's just his name and\nit's what's shown here.\n\n110\n00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,275\nBut where it really becomes\na problem is with email addresses.\n\n111\n00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:27,247\nNow here we're using first initial,\nlast name from the email address.\n\n112\n00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:32,065\nLike rwong@itprotv.net, but\nwhat if I was using first names?\n\n113\n00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,620\nAnd so\neverybody knows that I'm don@itprotv.net.\n\n114\n00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,936\nAnd then they're like I want to email\nRonnie, I bet he's ronnie@itprotv.net.\n\n115\n00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:43,210\nOr is he Ronald, I can't remember,\nwhich one is it, right?\n\n116\n00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,660\nSo maybe I want him to have\nmore than one address, and\n\n117\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,610\nwe can do these through aliases.\n\n118\n00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,966\nWhen you edit a user account like\nthis one, you can click on account.\n\n119\n00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,233\nAnd under the account you'll see\na section called Aliases, and\n\n120\n00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:58,940\nhere's all the different email\naddresses that are attached to Ronnie.\n\n121\n00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,520\nHe has only got one right\nnow rwong@itprotv.net.\n\n122\n00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040\nI can add in new ones.\n\n123\n00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,245\nI'm gonna give him ronnie@itprotv.net.\n\n124\n00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,120\nI'll just hit Save.\n\n125\n00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,970\nAnd after a moment, that'll save.\n\n126\n00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,080\nOh shoot, I've already got that\nattached to another account.\n\n127\n00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,413\nLet me just do ron here and\nI'll punch that one in.\n\n128\n00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:24,590\nSo now he's got rwong@itprotv.net and\nthen I just added ron.\n\n129\n00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,948\nNow, it's not showing up\nhere on my screen and\n\n130\n00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:29,073\nthere's two things that can cause this.\n\n131\n00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:32,365\nThe most common just being the page\nhasn't refreshed, all right.\n\n132\n00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,820\nNow you might be asking yourself\nwhy didn't we edit this out.\n\n133\n00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,050\nAnd the reasons is this\nhappens on the exam too.\n\n134\n00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,060\nSo don't panic if you make a change\nlike that and it doesn't take effect.\n\n135\n00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,400\nThe temptation is to immediately try and\nadd another alias.\n\n136\n00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,753\nBut it might be that\nthe alias is already there.\n\n137\n00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,525\nSo a good idea to do is to go ahead and\n\n138\n00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:52,210\njust hit the refresh button on your\nweb browser and let the page update.\n\n139\n00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,045\nAnd that way you can find out whether or\nnot the alias actually took effect.\n\n140\n00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,645\nOften times you'll find that it did,\n\n141\n00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:00,720\nthat the alias is there even\nthough the screen didn't show it.\n\n142\n00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,948\nIn my case it's not though.\n\n143\n00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:03,550\nSo, I'll need to go ahead and\nadd it again.\n\n144\n00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,480\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n145\n00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,620\nRemember when they grade the exam they're\nnot grading how you did something,\n\n146\n00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,449\nthey're grading the end result.\n\n147\n00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,936\nSo even though I did it properly,\nI typed in the name and I hit submit or\n\n148\n00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,303\nsave changes, I did it properly,\nif the end result isn't there,\n\n149\n00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,005\nI would get that question wrong.\n\n150\n00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,565\nSo it is important that you\nmake sure you do that properly.\n\n151\n00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:25,547\nSo I'll just re-add it, there we go and\n\n152\n00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:30,912\nnow I can see he's got rwong@itprotv and\nron@itprotv.net, right.\n\n153\n00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:33,913\nSo you can add in more,\nit maxes out at 20, you can put up to\n\n154\n00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:38,150\n20 aliases in there to give people all\nthe different addresses they need.\n\n155\n00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,388\nYou can do more than one domain.\n\n156\n00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:43,880\nIf you've got multiple email domains on\nyour account, you can punch those in too.\n\n157\n00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,581\nAll right, so those are our aliases.\n\n158\n00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,896\nThe last thing is suspending an account.\n\n159\n00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:53,235\nIf Ronnie's no longer gonna be working\nwith us, the temptation is to go and\n\n160\n00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,510\njust delete their account.\n\n161\n00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,340\nBut, you may actually have need for some\nof the resources attached to that account\n\n162\n00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,500\ndown the road, and so a better solution\nmight be to suspend the account.\n\n163\n00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,150\nSuspending it disables the ability for\nsomebody to log in, so\n\n164\n00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,010\nhe won't be able to log in as his account.\n\n165\n00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,372\nBut he'll still receive email, his\ndocuments will still be in Google Drive.\n\n166\n00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,560\nThey'll all be sitting there,\nhe just can't get at them.\n\n167\n00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,090\nThat's really useful if you still\nneed to keep that address valid or\n\n168\n00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,500\nif you think you might\nreactivate the user later.\n\n169\n00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,030\nIf you delete a user account you've\nonly got five days to bring them back,\n\n170\n00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,640\notherwise they lose all their data.\n\n171\n00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,353\nBut if you suspend them, you can leave\nthem suspended forever if you want and\n\n172\n00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,162\nturn them back on whenever you need.\n\n173\n00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,848\nSo you might have a seasonal employee,\n\n174\n00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,670\nsomebody who just works during\nthe holiday or during the summer.\n\n175\n00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,990\nAnd at the end of summer, you suspend them\nbut knowing that next summer you're going\n\n176\n00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,480\nto turn that account back on and\nactivate it again.\n\n177\n00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280\nTo suspend someone is really easy.\n\n178\n00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,620\nWhen you edit their account right\nhere on their main account page,\n\n179\n00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,710\nyou'll see under their picture\nis active user in the green bar.\n\n180\n00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,890\nThat's letting you know that they're\nactive, that they're a valid user account,\n\n181\n00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,180\nthey can login and do stuff.\n\n182\n00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,141\nIf we drop that down, you'll see\nsuspend user and I can choose that.\n\n183\n00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,560\nIt's gonna suspend the user and\nit'll let you know they can't login.\n\n184\n00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,590\nThey won't be able to get in,\nthey won't be able to access services, and\n\n185\n00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,110\nthey won't receive Invites to Gmail and\n\n186\n00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,440\ncalendar, but that's okay they'll still\nreceive the emails just not invitations.\n\n187\n00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,260\nSo, I'll go ahead and hit suspend and\nnow that account is suspended.\n\n188\n00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,480\nIt's still there, but\nit can't be logged in with.\n\n189\n00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,970\nAnd you'll notice when you go\nback out to your user screen\n\n190\n00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,970\nthat Ronnie no longer shows up here.\n\n191\n00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,750\nSo, I don't see Ronnie in my list and he's\nnot in my little sub-organization either.\n\n192\n00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,366\nHe's not in retired.\n\n193\n00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,293\nHe's just gone.\n\n194\n00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:39,984\nWell the reason is the default filter\non the users account defaults to active\n\n195\n00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,250\nusers only.\n\n196\n00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,740\nAnd if I change that and\n\n197\n00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,200\nswitch it to suspended users,\nthen there's Ronnie right there.\n\n198\n00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,870\nSo suspended users\nare hidden from the view.\n\n199\n00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,250\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n200\n00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,620\nIf you don't see your filters option,\n\n201\n00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,610\nmake sure you hit the little\nfunnel icon up here up at the top.\n\n202\n00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,370\nI usually keep that expanded on mine,\nand then you can switch back and\n\n203\n00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,490\nforth between active and suspended and\nsee the different accounts.\n\n204\n00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,750\nAll right, so we covered quiet\na bit this segment, right?\n\n205\n00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,830\nWe got a chance to see\nhow to rename a user.\n\n206\n00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,513\nWe saw how to move a user\nbetween organizations,\n\n207\n00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:16,709\nwe saw how to add aliases to a user\naccount if they've got more than one name.\n\n208\n00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,880\nAnd then we finally wrapped up looking at\nsuspending a user if they no longer need\n\n209\n00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160\naccess.\n\n210\n00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,230\nSo, quite a bit of stuff there, but\nnothing too challenging, right?\n\n211\n00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,070\nPretty easy to do if we just remember\nwhere to go to find the options\n\n212\n00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,300\nwe're looking for.\n\n213\n00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,672\nWell I hope you guys enjoyed the

accounts,\nretain data files for the deleted users.\n\n4\n00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,220\nAnd restore recently\ndeleted user accounts.\n\n5\n00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,370\nBasically these are the activities\nthat take place whenever we\n\n6\n00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,290\nremove an employee from our organization.\n\n7\n00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,130\nSo important things to know.\n\n8\n00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,690\nWhen we get rid of a user account well,\ndeleting them's the easy part.\n\n9\n00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,320\nWe can just float over their user account\nand you'll see the delete option.\n\n10\n00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,700\nOr we can check off more than one user and\ndelete them that way.\n\n11\n00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,710\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n12\n00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,490\nThe challenging part, though, is what\nhappens to their data when we delete them?\n\n13\n00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,650\nIf the user account has\ndata in Google Drive, and\n\n14\n00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,500\nthat shared storage across our company,\nwhat happens to their data?\n\n15\n00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,180\nThey were the owner, and if I remove them,\nwho's the owner of the data?\n\n16\n00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,550\nWell, we could just lose it,\nthen that's one option, right?\n\n17\n00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,370\nBut, it's not normally what we want.\n\n18\n00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,110\nSo when you go to delete a user, there's\na second activity that's really attached\n\n19\n00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,530\nto it, which is transferring\nownership of their documents.\n\n20\n00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,470\nWe wanna make sure that we don't lose\nall the documents that they worked on\n\n21\n00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,830\nin the company that they just\ndidn't share out with other people.\n\n22\n00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,410\n[LAUGH] And if it's an employee\nthat's being terminated,\n\n23\n00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,840\nthat usually happens quite a bit.\n\n24\n00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,350\nSo we need to have access to that data.\n\n25\n00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,490\nBut Google has got us covered.\n\n26\n00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,920\nThey kind of wrap all this\nall together into one action.\n\n27\n00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,220\nLet's take a look at it.\n\n28\n00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,820\nLet's say that I have an employee,\nlike Christopher Walken, right here.\n\n29\n00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,810\nAnd I'm going to be terminating him.\n\n30\n00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,370\nSo he's left the company.\n\n31\n00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,950\nHe no longer works for us.\n\n32\n00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,340\nI don't need to suspend his account.\n\n33\n00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,340\nHe's quit, he's gone,\nhe's not coming back.\n\n34\n00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,060\nSo, I need to remove his account.\n\n35\n00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,220\nI don't wanna pay the monthly fee to keep\nhis account here and active, all right?\n\n36\n00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,740\nSo I wanna get rid of him, and\n\n37\n00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,970\nwhen I remove him, I wanna transfer\nthe ownership of his documents to me.\n\n38\n00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,930\nAny document he had in Google Drive,\nI want that assigned to my account so\n\n39\n00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,890\nthat I can then give that\nout to whoever needs it.\n\n40\n00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,320\nAll right, well, if you float\nover the user, so if I float over\n\n41\n00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,650\nChristopher Walken, I'll see the delete\noption right there, and I can choose that.\n\n42\n00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,920\nOr, if I check him off,\nI'll see the delete user icon there.\n\n43\n00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,770\nA third way would be if I\nactually go into his account,\n\n44\n00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,060\nI'll see the delete user option there.\n\n45\n00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,100\nAll three of them do the exact same thing,\nso it doesn't really matter which one we\n\n46\n00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,390\nuse, it's just whichever screen we\nhappen to be on when we're doing it.\n\n47\n00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,170\nSo I'll use the float method here and I'm\ngonna choose to delete Christopher Walken.\n\n48\n00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,710\nAnd when I delete them it's gonna warn me,\n\n49\n00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,970\nit's gonna say hey this user has Google\nDrive data, what do you wanna do with it?\n\n50\n00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,770\nAnd the option is to assign\na new owner for that data,\n\n51\n00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,660\nnotice it's not gonna let me make\nthe mistake and wipe out the data.\n\n52\n00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,190\nIf I want to though,\nif I just want to get rid of his data,\n\n53\n00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,930\nI can just uncheck that and see how it\nsays delete account without data transfer?\n\n54\n00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,950\nThat's gonna get rid of the account and\nwipe out the data that it left behind.\n\n55\n00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,150\nMaybe he contributed absolutely\nnothing to my company, and so\n\n56\n00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,920\nI just wanna wipe out all his stuff.\n\n57\n00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,470\nI've got that option right there,\nI can do it.\n\n58\n00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,450\nBut normally we will transfer it off and\n\n59\n00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,820\nyou'll see this option to also include\ndata that is not shared with any one.\n\n60\n00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,790\nWhen we do this its basically looking at\nthings he shared with other employees and\n\n61\n00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,130\nthat when hes going to\ntransfer ownership to me.\n\n62\n00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,060\nBut what about documents or private that\nhe didn't share with other employees,\n\n63\n00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,380\nwell I'll need to check that off\nto make sure I get everything.\n\n64\n00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,122\nAll the documents that\nhe had in Google Drive.\n\n65\n00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:14,290\nAll right?\n\n66\n00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,360\nSo I'll check that off and\nI'll choose to assign a new owner.\n\n67\n00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440\nNow we can assign anyone to be the owner.\n\n68\n00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,310\nWe just need to specify\ntheir email address.\n\n69\n00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,760\nSo I'm going to specify myself.\n\n70\n00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,970\nRight there.\nSo I'll be the new owner, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,470\nAnd I'll go ahead and\ntransfer data and delete account.\n\n72\n00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,510\nThat's gonna remove the user account and\ntransfer the data over, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,180\nSo that's gonna take just a moment.\n\n74\n00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,280\nThe larger the amount of data,\nthe longer it'll take.\n\n75\n00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,390\nSo it actually tells you hey,\n\n76\n00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,600\nit's started,\nwe're done here as far as the GUI.\n\n77\n00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700\nYou'll get an email when\nit's actually done.\n\n78\n00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,460\nIt'll email you to let you know that\nthat account has been wiped out and\n\n79\n00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,180\nyou're ready to rock.\n\n80\n00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,410\nAll right, now what if I want\nto transfer the data but\n\n81\n00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,910\nI don't want to delete the account, right?\n\n82\n00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,740\nRemember in one of the earlier segments\nwe suspended Ronnie's account.\n\n83\n00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,810\nSo if I go into my suspended users,\nI've got Ronnie sitting right there and\n\n84\n00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,990\nmaybe I wanna get Ronnie's data\ntransferred to somebody else.\n\n85\n00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,200\nBut I don't wanna delete his account.\n\n86\n00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,530\nWell, the deletion was to\ngo transfer the stuff,\n\n87\n00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,830\nbut it'll delete his account, right?\n\n88\n00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,380\nSo I can't go that route.\n\n89\n00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,390\nIf I want to move data off of a user\nwithout actually deleting them,\n\n90\n00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,802\nI've gotta use my Google Drive settings,\nall right?\n\n91\n00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,489\nSo to do that I need to go\nback out to my Admin console.\n\n92\n00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,150\nAnd inside of the Admin console\nyou can go to Google Apps.\n\n93\n00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,810\nAnd inside of Google Apps\nyou'll find Google Drive.\n\n94\n00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,240\nAnd there we go.\n\n95\n00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,960\nSo I can go into drive.\n\n96\n00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,230\nAnd inside of Drive,\n\n97\n00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,650\nthey've got a nice little utility\nright here, Transfer ownership.\n\n98\n00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,650\nAnd so we can transfer file\nownership from a user without\n\n99\n00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,550\nactually removing their account.\n\n100\n00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,450\nAnd all you have to do is\nspecify their email address.\n\n101\n00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,550\nAnd so I had rwong@ITProTV.net and\nI'm going to transfer his documents\n\n102\n00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,760\nover to me, dpezet and I'll hit\ntransfer and it's going to go ahead and\n\n103\n00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,710\nqueue that up so we've successfully\ninitiated file transfer.\n\n104\n00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,540\nIt will email me when it's done.\n\n105\n00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,870\nThe more data, the longer it will take,\nbut otherwise It's transferring over,\n\n106\n00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,740\nall right?\n\n107\n00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,450\nSo that's how we can go about doing\nit without deleting the user account.\n\n108\n00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,300\nSo it's just up to you which one you want.\n\n109\n00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,920\nIf you want to delete the user account and\nwipe out their data,\n\n110\n00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,720\nyou just uncheck the drive boxes\nduring the deletion wizard.\n\n111\n00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,240\nIf you wanna delete the user in transfer,\nyou just use the wizard,\n\n112\n00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360\nit does it, right?\n\n113\n00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,730\nBut if you just wanna transfer data, you\ngo through the drive settings right here.\n\n114\n00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,089\nCouple of different ways\nto go through that.\n\n115\n00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,350\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,400\nNow, once a user has been deleted,\nwhat if we made a mistake?\n\n117\n00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,870\nWhat if we deleted the user and\nall of a sudden, we get a call from\n\n118\n00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,770\nhuman resources and they say you know\nwhat, there was a big misunderstanding.\n\n119\n00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,490\nThe employee quit, but they were mad\nabout something and we talked to them and\n\n120\n00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,640\nwe all came to an agreement and\nwant to bring him back on.\n\n121\n00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,160\nAnd all of a sudden,\nyou're sitting there and going great,\n\n122\n00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,640\nI deleted his account, wonderful.\n\n123\n00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,530\nNow, I gotta being them back.\n\n124\n00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,820\nWell, Google has a little\nsafety net built in for you.\n\n125\n00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,710\nWhen you delete an account,\nit doesn't actually go away.\n\n126\n00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,130\nIt will hold onto the account for\nfive days, right?\n\n127\n00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,170\nSo you've got five days.\n\n128\n00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,650\nIf in five days,\nyou decide you need that employee back,\n\n129\n00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,420\nyou can restore them\nback into your system.\n\n130\n00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,230\nSo that's kind of a nice feature, right?\n\n131\n00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,880\nBeing able to bring that right back in.\n\n132\n00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,470\nAnd have them in your system.\n\n133\n00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,800\nIf you wait more than five days\nthough the account is gone and so\n\n134\n00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,500\nyou'll just have to create a new account.\n\n135\n00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,950\nAnd the user will start over from scratch,\nall right.\n\n136\n00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,790\nTo recover a deleted user,\nyou just go back to your user screen and\n\n137\n00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,330\nyou might have seen this in\none of the earlier segments.\n\n138\n00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,470\nWhen we go into the user screen, we've\ngot these filters over on the right side.\n\n139\n00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,520\nIf you don't see them just\nhit the funnel icon up there.\n\n140\n00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,480\nAnd when you drop down the filters,\nyou'll see that there is a filter.\n\n141\n00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,630\nI guess that my head is covering that,\nlet me move that.\n\n142\n00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,270\nCalled recently deleted users.\n\n143\n00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,130\nAnd you can choose recently deleted users,\nand\n\n144\n00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,330\nit'll show anybody that's been deleted\nin your company in the last five days.\n\n145\n00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,400\nAnd I can see right there, cwalken,\nthere's that Christopher Walken account,\n\n146\n00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,150\nand so I can take that and\nI can restore it.\n\n147\n00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,380\nYou just check the users\nyou want to restore and\n\n148\n00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,830\nthen you hit that undelete user, and\nthat's gonna process the restore.\n\n149\n00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,590\nNow, when you restore them,\nif you have more than one organization,\n\n150\n00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,760\nit'll ask which one you want to restore\nto, I'll just send them to the main one.\n\n151\n00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,370\nAnd then it's gonna queue it up.\n\n152\n00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,890\nNow, it will give you a warning at some\npoint that'll tell you that it could take\n\n153\n00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,610\nup to two hours to restore the user.\n\n154\n00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,220\nThere's the warning.\n\n155\n00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,710\nAll right, and the reason is when you\ndelete an account, Google actually moves\n\n156\n00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,160\ntheir data off to lower end storage,\nless sensitive storage on their system.\n\n157\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,150\nProduction accounts,\nyour active user accounts,\n\n158\n00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,470\nthey're stored on very fast expensive\nstorage, but these deleted users,\n\n159\n00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,480\nGoogle knows that most companies\naren't gonna go and bring them back.\n\n160\n00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,810\nSo they move them off the less\nexpensive storage to make room for\n\n161\n00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,500\nthe important stuff, and that's why it can\ntake a little while to recover that data.\n\n162\n00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,050\nThis is not a priority activity for them.\n\n163\n00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,400\nYour production users, your active users,\nthose are the priority.\n\n164\n00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,910\nSo you won't see that\nuser pop up right away.\n\n165\n00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,090\nWhen I go into my user list,\nI don't see Christopher Walken, but\n\n166\n00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,230\nat some point in the next two hours,\nthat user account will magically reappear.\n\n167\n00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,340\nIt'll have the same password as before,\nand\n\n168\n00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,630\nyou'll be able to log in,\nand work with the system.\n\n169\n00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320\nAll right so\n\n170\n00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,660\nin this segment we got a chance to see\nhow to delete a user account, right?\n\n171\n00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,870\nIf we're terminating an employee or\njust removing them from our system.\n\n172\n00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,390\nWe saw how to transfer the ownership\nof their files to someone else,\n\n173\n00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,590\neither through the wizard, or\nmanually through the drive settings.\n\n174\n00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,830\nAnd lastly we got to see\nhow to restore a user\n\n175\n00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,612\nif we're still in that five day window and\nwe need the account back.\n\n176\n00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:30,836\nAll right,\nwell I hope you enjoyed the segments,\n\n177\n00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:35,676\nstay tuned,\nwe've got more Google apps coming up next.\n\n178\n00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,981\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18,817\nto Users in the Domain including\nCustom Administration Roles.\n\n4\n00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:19,972\nIt's quite a mouthful.\n\n5\n00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:25,270\nBasically, it's using permissions\ngroups inside of Google Apps.\n\n6\n00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,050\nWhen we create a new user in Google Apps,\nit is just a regular user and\n\n7\n00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,620\nthey will have access to email,\nor YouTube, or Google Drive, or\n\n8\n00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,810\nwhatever other services I have enabled for\nthe standard user accounts in my system.\n\n9\n00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,220\nBut, what if I want to delegate some\nadministrative duties to those users.\n\n10\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,720\nWhat if I want somebody else to\nbe able to create user accounts.\n\n11\n00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,010\nIt's a good idea.\n\n12\n00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,910\nYou don't want your company\nto be contingent upon\n\n13\n00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,340\none particular employee performing tasks.\n\n14\n00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,490\nRight, you should always\nhave duplication of duties.\n\n15\n00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,030\nWe don't want to have just one\nperson who's responsible for\n\n16\n00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,390\nadding user accounts.\n\n17\n00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,730\nBecause if that person's out sick,\nhow are you gonna add new user accounts?\n\n18\n00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,760\nOr, just one person who\ncan reset passwords.\n\n19\n00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,890\nAnd that way, if you forget your password,\nyou can only go to this one person.\n\n20\n00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,830\nYou don't wanna be in that situation.\n\n21\n00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,220\nSo, in Google Apps,\nwe have what are called system roles, and\n\n22\n00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,290\nthe system roles allow us to assign\ncertain permissions to users.\n\n23\n00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,160\nYou can make them\nfull-blown administrators,\n\n24\n00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,670\nthey can do anything they want.\n\n25\n00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,200\nIf that's what you're looking for.\n\n26\n00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,310\nBut ideally, you have a subset of\npermissions you want to give to users, and\n\n27\n00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,380\nthat's what you make use of.\n\n28\n00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,280\nThere's some that\nare built in to the system,\n\n29\n00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,220\nand then you can create your own custom\nones to meet your own needs, right.\n\n30\n00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,160\nIf we go into our admin console,\nit might not show up here by default.\n\n31\n00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,870\nIf you don't see the roles,\nyou can go down to More Controls.\n\n32\n00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,750\nAnd under More Controls,\nyou'll see admin roles right there.\n\n33\n00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,810\nWhen you go in to admin\nroles this will show the,\n\n34\n00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,170\nwell after I re-authenicate here,\n\n35\n00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,320\nit'll the built in administrative roles\nthat Google has already created for you.\n\n36\n00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,100\nSo you'll see Super Admin, Groups Admin,\n\n37\n00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,530\nUser Management Admin,\nHelp Desk Admin, and Services Admin.\n\n38\n00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,740\nThese are all roles that Google feels\nthat most organizations need, right.\n\n39\n00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,000\nIf you want somebody else to be a full\nblown administrator on the system,\n\n40\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400\nyou've got the Super Admin role and\nyou can add them in there and\n\n41\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,130\nnow they'll have that\naccess on your system.\n\n42\n00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,780\nYou'll also see like Groups Admin or\nUser Management,\n\n43\n00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,310\nyou know groups is to be able\nto create and manage groups.\n\n44\n00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,600\nOr user management to Control users,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,480\nMost of these are pretty self-explanatory.\n\n46\n00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,840\nGoogle has a nice little web page that\nI like to refer to, which is this one.\n\n47\n00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,600\nAnd I'll post the link with\nthe episode on the website.\n\n48\n00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,610\nBut these are the pre-built administrator\nroles and exactly what access they have.\n\n49\n00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,649\nSo you don't have to guess about\nwhat you're giving somebody.\n\n50\n00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:45,670\nThis'll specifically tell\nyou what they've got.\n\n51\n00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,070\nSo if you give somebody Super Admin,\nthey can do everything.\n\n52\n00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,700\nThey can do everything on your account.\n\n53\n00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,120\nSo you'll see here's a list of\nthings that only they can do.\n\n54\n00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,222\nThey can create administrator roles,\nthey can reset administrator passwords,\n\n55\n00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:01,264\nthey can do all sorts of really\nhigh level, powerful stuff.\n\n56\n00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,204\nAll right.\n\n57\n00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:05,020\nBut if we go down to something\nlike a user admin, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,640\nUser Management Admin,\nthey can view user profiles, create and\n\n59\n00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,270\ndelete user accounts, rename users, right.\n\n60\n00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,141\nBut not change the passwords for\nadministrator accounts.\n\n61\n00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,980\nSee how it says applies only for\nusers who aren't administrators.\n\n62\n00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,254\nSo there's boundaries on their power.\n\n63\n00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,698\nOne of my favorite is the Help Desk Admin.\n\n64\n00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:26,880\nThe Help Desk Admin, who can reset\npasswords for users, but that's it.\n\n65\n00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,150\nThey can't create user accounts.\n\n66\n00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,166\nYou have these limitations in place so\n\n67\n00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,887\nthat you don't give somebody more\naccess than they absolutely need.\n\n68\n00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:38,060\nIt's called the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n69\n00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,800\nNow the roles that are in place,\nthey may work out fine for you and\n\n70\n00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,610\nyou can use them.\n\n71\n00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,530\nSo going to my environment,\nif I go back to my user list,\n\n72\n00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,250\nI can see my list of users so maybe I want\nto take, I'll take Marty Freedmen here.\n\n73\n00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,230\nI want Marty Freedman to\nbe a help desk manager, so\n\n74\n00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,760\nI want him to be able to reset\npasswords for other users.\n\n75\n00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,590\nSo I'm gonna go back here\nto my Admin console, and\n\n76\n00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,050\nI'll go to More Controls and Admin Roles.\n\n77\n00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,140\nAnd I'll go to Help Desk Admin, and\n\n78\n00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,450\nI can see a list of current\npeople that are Help Desk Admins.\n\n79\n00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,510\nAnd I can choose to assign a new admin,\nand I'm gonna put in Marty Freedman.\n\n80\n00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,690\nThere he is.\n\n81\n00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,763\nSo we got Marty in there and\nI'm gonna give him rights.\n\n82\n00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,556\nNow, when you give somebody\na role of permissions,\n\n83\n00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,611\nyou have to choose what\norganization they're a part of.\n\n84\n00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,980\nAnd if your company only has one\norganization than that's fine,\n\n85\n00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,180\nyou ignore it.\n\n86\n00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,760\nBut if you have sub-organizations like\nI do, I've got this one called retired.\n\n87\n00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,050\nWhen you give him access over the parent,\nthe permissions trickle down.\n\n88\n00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,550\nSo, he'll have permissions over\nthe sub-organization also.\n\n89\n00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,153\nOr, I can give him access to\njust the sub-organization.\n\n90\n00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:49,300\nSo, you can pick and choose where they\nget their permissions in the system.\n\n91\n00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,754\nBut, I'm gonna give him the whole thing,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:55,870\nSo, I'll pick the ITProTV net organization\nand I'll hit confirm assignment.\n\n93\n00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,900\nAnd now he's in the list I've\ngot a new help desk manager.\n\n94\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,410\nAlright?\n\n95\n00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,900\nSo real easy to give\nthese permissions out.\n\n96\n00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,930\nNow Marty can start to do some\nof the administrative duties and\n\n97\n00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,229\nI'm not being overly burdened\nwith it in my system.\n\n98\n00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,280\nNow it may be that there isn't\na role that suits your needs.\n\n99\n00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,173\nAnd in that scenario,\nyou might need to create your own.\n\n100\n00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:18,480\nSo for example, you can see I've\nalready done one called Report Admin.\n\n101\n00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,490\nI wanted to have users that can\ngenerate reports in my system.\n\n102\n00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,350\nWell a regular user can't do that by\ndefault, they don't have that permission.\n\n103\n00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,103\nSo I created a custom role to meet my\nneed, one for being a Report Admin,\n\n104\n00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,496\nall right, but you can create\nwhatever role it is that you need.\n\n105\n00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:36,922\nWhen you hit, create a new role,\nit's gonna ask you for a name, and\n\n106\n00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,979\nyou call it whatever it is that you want.\n\n107\n00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,537\nAnd, then when you create it, it's gonna\nask what privileges these users will get.\n\n108\n00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:49,450\nAnd you get to browse through here and\npick and choose exactly what they need.\n\n109\n00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,430\nSo you have got some particular\nscenario that you wanna deal with.\n\n110\n00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,304\nSo maybe under services here, I want these\nguys to be able to manage mobile devices,\n\n111\n00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,260\nall right.\n\n112\n00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,500\nSo these are gonna be mobile device admin.\n\n113\n00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,960\nSo I'm just gonna check that off.\n\n114\n00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,331\nI'm not gonna bother checking\noff any of these other options.\n\n115\n00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,930\nI want to keep it fairly limited,\njust to dealing with mobile.\n\n116\n00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,850\nSo I'll go ahead and save changes and\nso now I've got this custom role,\n\n117\n00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,980\nthat is going to provide\nthem with the mobile admin.\n\n118\n00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,971\nThat ability to control those devices.\n\n119\n00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,990\nSo create as many of those as you need.\n\n120\n00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,566\nIt's whatever is flexible for\nyour organization.\n\n121\n00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:28,340\nYou can always go back and edit them\nif you want to change the permissions.\n\n122\n00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,704\nMaybe you find out, oh,\nhaving mobile isn't enough.\n\n123\n00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,800\nI need to give them a little\nbit more to control it.\n\n124\n00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,294\nNow the permissions or the privileges,\nit's a pretty big list.\n\n125\n00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:39,330\nThere's a lot of stuff in here and\nyou can pick and choose.\n\n126\n00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,896\nA lot of them will expand out and\nyou'll have things like create, read,\n\n127\n00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:43,835\nupdate, delete.\n\n128\n00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:47,320\nSo you might need to issue out read\npermissions for certain things.\n\n129\n00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,870\nIf you're gonna manage\nthe mobile settings,\n\n130\n00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,380\nmaybe you need to allow them\nto read on the user accounts.\n\n131\n00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,130\nSo you can pick and choose from there,\nbreaking each one down very,\n\n132\n00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,630\nvery granular.\n\n133\n00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,565\nIf you want a deeper explanation of these,\n\n134\n00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,565\nthere's a great article that Google\nhas posted and again I'll post\n\n135\n00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:05,895\nthe link with this episode called\nAdministrator privilege definitions.\n\n136\n00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,755\nAnd it goes through and\n\n137\n00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:11,025\nbreaks down each one of those permissions\nwith exactly what we're giving out.\n\n138\n00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,635\nAnd so when you look in here and\nsee like user security management,\n\n139\n00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,415\nsecurity settings and so on.\n\n140\n00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:18,624\nThis will have the breakdown\nof what it is that they do and\n\n141\n00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,179\nwhat permissions you're giving out.\n\n142\n00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:23,270\nSo when I gave out mobile\npermissions you'll see here,\n\n143\n00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,160\nallows full control over mobile\ndevices in the admin console.\n\n144\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,570\nAdministrators with this\nprivilege can activate, delete,\n\n145\n00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,800\nwipe and\notherwise manage all mobile devices.\n\n146\n00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,150\nThe privilege is automatically\nselected by the services privilege.\n\n147\n00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,290\nSo I just turn it on,\nI give somebody the access and\n\n148\n00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,710\nthat's what they're gong to get.\n\n149\n00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,450\nSo you can look through here\nto figure out what each one\n\n150\n00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,670\nis really going to be giving out.\n\n151\n00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,950\nAll right, that is really handy as far\nas delegating out those permissions and\n\n152\n00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,140\nit saves you a lot of time.\n\n153\n00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,040\nSo in this segment we took a look at\nusing the pre-built security roles that\n\n154\n00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,728\nare already a part of your\nGoogle Apps installation.\n\n155\n00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,234\nAnd then we got a chance to see\ncreating our own custom roles and\n\n156\n00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,730\nassigning users to them.\n\n157\n00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,270\nI guess I didn't really assign users to my\ncustom role, but it's done the same way.\n\n158\n00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,569\nYou just go to the admins tab,\nadd in whatever users you want,\n\n159\n00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,038\nreally straightforward.\n\n160\n00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,988\nKeep in mind that a user can\nhave more than one role.\n\n161\n00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:18,741\nSo maybe Marty Freedman can be\nin that Report Admin role, and\n\n162\n00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,621\nin the custom Mobile Admin role,\nthat I made.\n\n163\n00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:25,056\nHe can be in more than one, whatever\npermissions that particular user needs,\n\n164\n00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,922\nyou just assign the roles and\nthey'll have it.\n\n165\n00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,380\nAll right well I hope you\nguys enjoyed the segment.\n\n166\n00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,624\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Google Apps coming up next.\n\n167\n00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16,541\nSpecifically it says demonstrating\nhow to reset a user password,\n\n4\n00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,000\nforce a user to change their password, and\n\n5\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,326\nmonitor the strength of the passwords\nthat your users currently have set.\n\n6\n00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:26,927\nSo this is an important thing for us to\nbe able to keep track of it just from\n\n7\n00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:30,362\na security perspective,\nhow are users managing their passwords?\n\n8\n00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:33,984\nSo real important thing and\nnot a terribly difficult thing to do.\n\n9\n00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:37,404\nWhen we create our user accounts,\nyou might remember from an earlier episode\n\n10\n00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,360\nwhere we imported our user accounts,\nwe have to pick passwords for them.\n\n11\n00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,300\nBut, at the end of the day the users\nare gonna reset those passwords and\n\n12\n00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,250\npick something different.\n\n13\n00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,270\nAnd when they do, they may pick\nsomething that's nice and secure.\n\n14\n00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,360\nThey may pick something that's weak, that\ndoesn't meet our minimum requirements or\n\n15\n00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,200\nthat just isn't a good\npassword in general.\n\n16\n00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,490\nSo we need a way to be able to\nkeep track of that, all right?\n\n17\n00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,360\nAnd that's what this objective is\nall about, how we can handle that.\n\n18\n00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360\nThe first thing is, what if we\nwant to reset a user's password?\n\n19\n00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,990\nWe've got a user and for whatever reason\nwe need to cause their password to reset.\n\n20\n00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,228\nThe most common cause for\nthis is they've forgotten their password.\n\n21\n00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,409\nSo user can't remember their password and\nwe need to reset them.\n\n22\n00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,198\nAll right.\n\n23\n00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:19,014\nWell, we can do that pretty easily\nright here from our admin console.\n\n24\n00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,698\nIf we go to our users screen and\nwe pick a particular user, so\n\n25\n00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,405\nI'll take Dave Mustaine.\n\n26\n00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,250\nAll right, when I pick this user account,\nhere's his account.\n\n27\n00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,630\nAnd we'll see some of the different\noptions that we've got in here for\n\n28\n00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,390\nlooking at his account.\n\n29\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,480\nAnd there's an icon up here,\n\n30\n00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,740\nwhich it's supposed to be\na padlock with an arrow on it.\n\n31\n00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,467\nKinda looks like a purse, though.\n\n32\n00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:43,483\n[LAUGH] And we can choose to\nreset the user's password.\n\n33\n00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:44,890\nSo I can click on that.\n\n34\n00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,980\nAnd here's a chance to punch in\na password for that account.\n\n35\n00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,680\nI can auto generate\na password if I want or\n\n36\n00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,660\nI can manually set it to something I need.\n\n37\n00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,490\nOne example where we might do this is if\nthe user forgot their password, right.\n\n38\n00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,682\nHere is one way to do it.\n\n39\n00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,596\nYou can set it to something temporary and\n\n40\n00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:02,814\nchoose to require a change of\npassword the next time they sign-in.\n\n41\n00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,829\nSo now I can call Dave on this phone and\nsay hey,\n\n42\n00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,700\nnext time you login here is your password.\n\n43\n00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,170\nYou will change it when you login.\n\n44\n00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,970\nOr maybe this employee\nhas been terminated.\n\n45\n00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,700\nAnd I wanna log in as this employee\nto be able to see their email and\n\n46\n00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,670\nGoogle Drive documents and\naccess their other resources.\n\n47\n00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,190\nSo I might just want to reset this\nuser to something that I know, so\n\n48\n00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,770\nthat I can log in and\ncontrol that account.\n\n49\n00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,950\nSo I can go in here and\n\n50\n00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,760\nI can punch it in, and I get my normal\npassword strength monitor right there,\n\n51\n00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,879\nit's letting me know that I'm typing in\na strong password or a weak password.\n\n52\n00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,390\nAnd I can reset it.\n\n53\n00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,090\nSince I manually set the password,\n\n54\n00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,620\nI'm gonna uncheck that require\nchange of password at next login.\n\n55\n00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,270\nSo we'll go ahead and reset that.\n\n56\n00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,220\nAnd that'll take care of that one.\n\n57\n00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,320\nAll right.\n\n58\n00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,460\nWhat if I'm concerned that\na user has a weak password?\n\n59\n00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,070\nAnd I just want them to have to\nchange it the next time they log in.\n\n60\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,572\nSo maybe I got reports that possibly\none of my employees shared their\n\n61\n00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,178\npassword with somebody else.\n\n62\n00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,250\nWell, I might want to force\nthem to reset their password.\n\n63\n00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,520\nI don't necessarily want\nto know what it is.\n\n64\n00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,980\nI don't wanna go in and\nchange the password myself.\n\n65\n00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,960\nI just want them to have to change\nit the next time they log in.\n\n66\n00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760\nWell, you can do that too.\n\n67\n00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,470\nRight here from the user screen,\nif you click on their account, so well,\n\n68\n00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,880\nI'm already in their account, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,970\nBut we've got this actual\naccount link here.\n\n70\n00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,420\nAnd if we go into the account you'll\nsee information about the password.\n\n71\n00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,300\nSee it's telling me right now that\nthis password was set by the admin.\n\n72\n00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,510\nWell the next time they log in,\nif I check that option it would reset it.\n\n73\n00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,310\nBut I didn't check that option.\n\n74\n00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,450\nSo, Dave could keep using the password\nthat I set for as long as he wants.\n\n75\n00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,080\nRight.\n\n76\n00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,030\nBut the problem is,\nis that two people know the password and\n\n77\n00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,000\nthat's always a bad thing.\n\n78\n00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,060\nHe knows it because I told him and\nI know it because I set it.\n\n79\n00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,220\nSo, I might want to force him to change\nhis password the next time he logs in.\n\n80\n00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,840\nSo you've got that option right here.\n\n81\n00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,120\nWe can check that little box that says,\n\n82\n00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,350\nrequire user to change\npassword at next sign-in.\n\n83\n00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,420\nNow the next time he signs in\nhe'll have to change the password.\n\n84\n00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,170\nOne slight program with this though,\n\n85\n00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,750\nwhen you sign in an authentication\ntoken is generated for your account.\n\n86\n00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,150\nAnd that token can be good for\nup to 24 hours in some scenarios.\n\n87\n00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,688\nSo that means he might not have\nto log in again until tomorrow.\n\n88\n00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,225\nIf I'm in a hurry and I need him to\nchange that password right away,\n\n89\n00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,192\nI know his account got compromised.\n\n90\n00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:16,630\nI need him to change that password now.\n\n91\n00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,920\nYou'll notice this little option here that\nsays reset sign-in cookies, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,110\nThat'll take any current session\nhe's got with Google and log it out.\n\n93\n00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,550\nSo, he'll be forced to change\nhis password right away.\n\n94\n00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,460\nThat's a great way to do it.\n\n95\n00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,640\nI'm gonna go and hit that, and so\nthat's gonna reset the sign-in cookies.\n\n96\n00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,017\nSo, any current session\nhe has is now dead.\n\n97\n00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:41,760\nI've checked require user change password\nat next login and I'll hit Save changes.\n\n98\n00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,880\nAnd now, the next time they log in, they\ncan punch in the password I gave them, but\n\n99\n00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,720\nit'll force them to change their password.\n\n100\n00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,310\nAll right?\n\n101\n00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,992\nSo, pretty easy to do,\nmakes them change the password and\n\n102\n00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,238\nthey'll be able to get in and\nwork with the system.\n\n103\n00:04:56,238 --> 00:05:01,624\nAll right, now, if I suspect the user\nhas a weak password, how do I know?\n\n104\n00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:06,551\nIf I'm the one who set it, so if I take\nthis user and I go to reset password and\n\n105\n00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:11,560\nI'm the one who sets it, I can\nintentionally set it to something weak.\n\n106\n00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,360\nSo, this password that I'm typing in\nright here, it's a dictionary word, and\n\n107\n00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,500\nI'm just sticking the number\none on the end of it,\n\n108\n00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,060\nso it's not a very strong password at all,\nI'll go ahead and reset it.\n\n109\n00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,510\nSee, it let me do it.\n\n110\n00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,570\nIt let me set a somewhat weak password.\n\n111\n00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,460\nSo if your end-users are doing that,\nyour organization is at risk.\n\n112\n00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,560\nSo we may want to double check our users\nto make sure that they're doing secure\n\n113\n00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,500\npasswords.\n\n114\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,480\nWell, there's a nice little\nreport we can use to view that.\n\n115\n00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,240\nMost of my users were just imported so\nthe report's not gonna work for them.\n\n116\n00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,340\nBut for some of my other users,\nlike myself or Dave or\n\n117\n00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,200\nsomebody, these'll show up.\n\n118\n00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,530\nUsually, the user has to\nlog in at least once.\n\n119\n00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,610\nSo, I guess I could log in as Dave real\nquick and get a chance to see that.\n\n120\n00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,400\nSo, let's do that.\n\n121\n00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,470\nI'm gonna sign out here.\n\n122\n00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,854\nAnd I'm gonna sign in as\ndmustaine@itprotv.net.\n\n123\n00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:07,105\nAll right, and I'll punch in that\npassword that I assigned for him.\n\n124\n00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,620\nOh, actually, I did a weak password.\n\n125\n00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,470\nLet me type in the weak one.\n\n126\n00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,670\nThere we go.\n\n127\n00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,990\nSo I'm gonna sign in as him, and\nsee how it's saying it's a new account,\n\n128\n00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,720\nI still have to accept the agreement.\n\n129\n00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840\nThat's why the report won't work for\na new user.\n\n130\n00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,728\nThey haven't even accepted\na license agreement yet.\n\n131\n00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,536\nSo let's skip my verification and\nthere we go.\n\n132\n00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:29,970\nSo he's in and he can start to access his\nresources, access his email and so on.\n\n133\n00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,160\nAll right, well he's in.\n\n134\n00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,340\nHe logged in with a weak password,\nhe hasn't changed it.\n\n135\n00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,210\nSo he still has that weak password.\n\n136\n00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,300\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlog out and log back in as me.\n\n137\n00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,550\nAnd when I log in, I'm gonna run\na quick report to show me my users and\n\n138\n00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,320\nshow me whether or\nnot they've got good passwords.\n\n139\n00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,430\nRight, because they probably don't in\nsome cases, maybe some of them do.\n\n140\n00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,930\nSo let me just get to my Admin panel.\n\n141\n00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,040\nI went to the wrong page there.\n\n142\n00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,370\nSo let me get back over to my Admin panel,\nand we'll pull up that report.\n\n143\n00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,230\nThe report itself is kinda\nburied away a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,990\nIt's in your Security tool,\n\n145\n00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,140\nand I don't believe the Security\ntool is displayed by default.\n\n146\n00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,080\nSo, if you don't see that one by default,\nit might be buried under More Controls.\n\n147\n00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,060\nSo sometimes when you log in,\nyou may see less icons here than I do.\n\n148\n00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,060\nSo if it's buried under more controls,\nyou just click down here, and\n\n149\n00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,950\nyou go to Security.\n\n150\n00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,350\nAnd once you go to Security, you'll see\nPassword monitoring, right there, and\n\n151\n00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,120\nyou can generate a Password\nmonitoring report.\n\n152\n00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,730\nAnd when I look at my report I can see\n\n153\n00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,240\nthat I've got a ten character\npassword that's strong.\n\n154\n00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,030\nI've got upper case and lower case.\n\n155\n00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,590\nI've got letters and numbers,\nI've got special characters right?\n\n156\n00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,227\nIt's a complex password, but Dave\nMustaine, his is just a dictionary word,\n\n157\n00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:54,410\nall lowercase,\nfollowed by a single number.\n\n158\n00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,990\nThat's not a complex password,\nthat's a weak password, and\n\n159\n00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,810\nsince it's weak, it's showing that.\n\n160\n00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,720\nIt's not telling me what his password is,\nI dunno, but it's tell, well,\n\n161\n00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,110\nI guess I do know, I set it, right?\n\n162\n00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,810\nBut normally I wouldn't know but\n\n163\n00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,960\nI can see that it is weak, and\nthe password's ranked as a red, right.\n\n164\n00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,860\nSo this lets me quickly look\nat my employees and say,\n\n165\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,780\nman, Dave's gotta get a stronger password,\nlet me go force him to reset that.\n\n166\n00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,090\nAnd let me reach out to him,\nlet me give him a little phone call and\n\n167\n00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,340\ntell him like hey you need\nto do a better password.\n\n168\n00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,600\nWe'll see in a later segment that we\ncan set policies that dictate this to\n\n169\n00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,720\nprevent them from putting\na weak password in.\n\n170\n00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,060\nBut with the default\nsettings it is possible.\n\n171\n00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,291\nThey can enter a weak password and\nthere it'll be, and\n\n172\n00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,743\nif you click on the user you'll be\nable to jump right over to them And\n\n173\n00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:38,200\nyou'll be able to go in and\nenforce that password reset right there.\n\n174\n00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,002\nIt's real easy to do and\nget your system more secure.\n\n175\n00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:45,750\nAll right so in this segment we got\na chance to see how to force a user to\n\n176\n00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,220\nreset their password,\nwe also saw how to reset it ourselves.\n\n177\n00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,575\nAnd we got a chance to see how to monitor\nthe passwords that our users are choosing\n\n178\n00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,265\nto make sure they're secure.\n\n179\n00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:57,519\nThat pretty much wraps up this one,\nso stay tuned.\n\n180\n00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,747\nWe've got more Google Apps\ncoming up later.\n\n181\n00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,042\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

inside\n\n3\n00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:14,000\nof Google Apps.\n\n4\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,670\nThe full title is,\nDemonstrate How To Create and\n\n5\n00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,010\nUse Organizational Units to Manage Users,\nGroups and Security Settings.\n\n6\n00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,980\nMany companies aren't really\ngoing to leverage this.\n\n7\n00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,230\nIn a small or medium company,\n\n8\n00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,240\nyour employees are usually part of\none big organization and that's it.\n\n9\n00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,970\nBut the larger your organization becomes,\nthe more separations and\n\n10\n00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,220\ndifferences you have between employees,\nand\n\n11\n00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,430\nit becomes practical to divide your\ncompany up into sub-organizations.\n\n12\n00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,240\nEven if your company is\nsimply one big unit,\n\n13\n00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,350\nthere are still times you might use this.\n\n14\n00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,570\nA great example is if you\ndeal with contractors,\n\n15\n00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,520\nor third party companies that you have\ntemporary business relationships with.\n\n16\n00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,500\nFor them, you might want to bring them in\nto your Google Apps environment to be able\n\n17\n00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,390\nto give them email addresses and\nallow them access to Google Drive and\n\n18\n00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,650\nall that other good stuff.\n\n19\n00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,520\nBut you might want to a different\nset of password restrictions or\n\n20\n00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,560\nother security policies.\n\n21\n00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,150\nYou might not want to turn\non every feature, but\n\n22\n00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,910\njust turn on certain features for\nthose users.\n\n23\n00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,161\nWell that's really hard to do if you're\ntreating all of your users as one\n\n24\n00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,610\nbig organization.\n\n25\n00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,100\nBut if we divide our company\nup into sub-organizations,\n\n26\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,710\nthen we can really have some power and\ncontrol over that.\n\n27\n00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,430\nSo, it really comes down\nto security policies.\n\n28\n00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,450\nIf you need separate security policies and\nconfigurations for\n\n29\n00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,030\nyour users, you'll need multiple\norganizations, all right.\n\n30\n00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,880\nCreating them is, fortunately,\nreally, really easy.\n\n31\n00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,450\nLet me just bring up my admin panel here.\n\n32\n00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,280\nNow when you first sign up for\nGoogle Apps, you'll pick what your\n\n33\n00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240\nprimary domain name is, and that will\nbecome your default organization.\n\n34\n00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,160\nSo you'll always have one organization.\n\n35\n00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,200\nAnd then after that,\nyou can create organizations at will.\n\n36\n00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,030\nAnd they can be domain names, or they can\njust be whatever you want to call them.\n\n37\n00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,870\nYou can call them whatever the heck you\nwant, based on the needs of your company.\n\n38\n00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,710\nTo create organizations,\nyou just go into your Users screen.\n\n39\n00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,170\nAnd in your Users screen on the right\nside, it'll show your Organization list.\n\n40\n00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,250\nIf it doesn't show up, you just need\nto turn on your filter screen, and\n\n41\n00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,790\nyou'll see it right there.\n\n42\n00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,630\nSo you can see on mine, I've got\nan organization called ITProTV.net.\n\n43\n00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,350\nAnd I've created a child organization.\n\n44\n00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,010\nSee how it's nested under ITProTV.net?\n\n45\n00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,250\nAnd I've got retired.\n\n46\n00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,360\nAnd so I might have employees that\nhave retired from the company, but\n\n47\n00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,950\nI still want them to have a user account,\nstill be able to log in and get to email.\n\n48\n00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,330\nAnd so\nI move them over to the retired one, and\n\n49\n00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,980\nI can change the policies on that\norganization to only allow email.\n\n50\n00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,380\nMaybe they don't get Google Drive anymore\nor all the other things, just email.\n\n51\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,060\nI can do that because it's\na separate organization.\n\n52\n00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,590\nYou can create as many\norganizations as you want.\n\n53\n00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,595\nYou just add them in based\non your company's needs.\n\n54\n00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:52,790\nAnd you can nest them several\nlevels deep if you want.\n\n55\n00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,820\nSo for example, I might deal with\nseveral different contractors.\n\n56\n00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,470\nSo I might want to create a new\norganization called Contractors, and\n\n57\n00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,620\ninside of it, I might create\ndifferent organizations for them.\n\n58\n00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,020\nCreating an organization is pretty simple.\n\n59\n00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,380\nYou just float over an organization,\nusually your parent one, the main one.\n\n60\n00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,470\nAnd you hit the drop-down box to the right\nside of that, and you'll see two options,\n\n61\n00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,220\nAdd a sub-organization or\nEdit the current organization.\n\n62\n00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,620\nThere's not a lot to edit, you can change\nthe name and description, that's about it,\n\n63\n00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,430\nso not terribly exciting.\n\n64\n00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,570\nBut, I might not wanna\ncall this ITProTV.net,\n\n65\n00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,105\nI might wanna call it ITProTV, right?\n\n66\n00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:35,582\nSo this is my\nPrimary ITProTV Organization, right?\n\n67\n00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,220\nSo, something that makes a little more\nsense to users that may see this.\n\n68\n00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,000\nAll right, so now I've got it.\n\n69\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,471\nAnd my organization's just called ITProTV.\n\n70\n00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,850\nI've got retired here,\nwhich I did all lowercase.\n\n71\n00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,860\nI must have been lazy when I typed that,\nso I'll just rename that one Retired.\n\n72\n00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,350\nOkay.\n\n73\n00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,360\nNow if I want to create more I can\njust float over that arrow and\n\n74\n00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,600\ndrop it down, and\nI can choose to add a sub-organization.\n\n75\n00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,168\nSo I'm gonna add one called Contractors.\n\n76\n00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:05,762\nAll right, so here’s my Contractors, I\ncould type in a description if I want, and\n\n77\n00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,678\nthen who this is going to be under.\n\n78\n00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:10,162\nNotice I can put it under Retired.\n\n79\n00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:15,062\nYou can nest these organizations\nseveral levels deep if you need to.\n\n80\n00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:18,750\nWell I want mine to be under the parent\norganization so I'll create it there.\n\n81\n00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,400\nAnd in just a second it'll refresh,\nand there's Contractors.\n\n82\n00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,310\nBut maybe under Contractors, maybe I\ndeal with several other companies there.\n\n83\n00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,380\nSo I might come under Contractors and\nchoose to add other sub-organizations.\n\n84\n00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,290\nSo maybe I deal with Halliburton, right.\n\n85\n00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,940\nSo I'll punch in Halliburton here.\n\n86\n00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,210\nI'm gonna put that under Contractors.\n\n87\n00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,910\nThere we go, so now I've got Halliburton.\n\n88\n00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,300\nAnd I can continue to add more.\n\n89\n00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,710\nMaybe I do EdutainmentLIVE, right.\n\n90\n00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,920\nSo I get some contractors from there.\n\n91\n00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,130\nAnd so now I've got two different\nclassifications of Contractor,\n\n92\n00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,830\nall underneath\nthe Contractor organization,\n\n93\n00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,390\nwhich is all underneath my primary\norganization of ITProTV, right?\n\n94\n00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,120\nSo you can break this\ndown however you need it.\n\n95\n00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,630\nFor the parent organization,\n\n96\n00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,010\nthis main one, there's not\na whole lot you can do with it.\n\n97\n00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,180\nYou can rename it and that's about it.\n\n98\n00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,670\nBut for the other guys,\n\n99\n00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,548\nif you hit that drop-down arrow\nyou'll see a few different options.\n\n100\n00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:15,760\nAdd a sub-organization and\nEdit, we've seen those.\n\n101\n00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,420\nBut Move and Delete, you can delete a\nsub-organization if you don't need it, and\n\n102\n00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,830\nyou can move them if you wanna\nchange the organizational structure.\n\n103\n00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,460\nSo it's not all set in stone.\n\n104\n00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,240\nThe only one that's set in\nstone is that parent one.\n\n105\n00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,840\nYou can't change it other than its name.\n\n106\n00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,580\nOnce I've created these organizations,\nmy next step is to put users in them.\n\n107\n00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,180\nSo I need to move my\nuser accounts around so\n\n108\n00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,570\nthat they're in\nthe appropriate organization.\n\n109\n00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,015\nAnd so I would just go through and\ncheck the users.\n\n110\n00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,625\nAnd then once I've got them checked,\nI've got this Move to another organization\n\n111\n00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,335\nbutton I would hit to move them\nto the particular location.\n\n112\n00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,255\nI think I've already got some\npeople that are retired.\n\n113\n00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,077\nLet's see, yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:58,028\nSo I might wanna take Chris here, and I'll\nmove him to put him in EdutainmentLIVE,\n\n115\n00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,640\nall right, so I'll move him off.\n\n116\n00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,370\nAnd then I might take Chris, or\nwe just did Chris, I'll do Gar this time.\n\n117\n00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,710\nSo I'll take Gar Samuelson, and\nI'll move him to Halliburton, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,830\nSo we can just check right through,\n\n119\n00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,350\nand hit that option, and I'm gonna move\nthem off to the appropriate location.\n\n120\n00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,270\nIf your screen doesn't refresh right away,\ndon't worry about it, right.\n\n121\n00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,960\nYou can usually just click around and\nit'll update.\n\n122\n00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,060\nAnd if I go into EdutainmentLIVE,\nthere's Chris.\n\n123\n00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,600\nAnd if I go into Halliburton,\nthere's Gar Samuelson, right?\n\n124\n00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,117\nMoved to the appropriate organizations.\n\n125\n00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,534\nNow the policies that we set,\n\n126\n00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,598\nall of the policies and\nconfigurations that we've been doing so\n\n127\n00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,790\nfar have been right up here at the ITProTV\norganization, at the top level.\n\n128\n00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,690\nAnd those settings trickle\ndown to the sub-organizations.\n\n129\n00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,860\nSo, since everything was done here,\n\n130\n00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,580\nit's all trickling down to these\nother sub-organizations I've made.\n\n131\n00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,070\nSo when I move those users,\nare they gonna notice any difference?\n\n132\n00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,640\nNo, everything is the same to them, right?\n\n133\n00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,260\nBut, now I have the power to go and\noverride settings at any of these levels,\n\n134\n00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,040\nto change what the users see,\nwhat they experience.\n\n135\n00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,545\nAnd we'll notice throughout\nthe user interface here,\n\n136\n00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,930\nthat as we start to look at things like\nour users, we'll be able to go into our\n\n137\n00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,310\nuser list in the admin panel and\nfilter based on organization.\n\n138\n00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,382\nOr when we go to define policies\nwe'll define by organization.\n\n139\n00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:22,300\nSo we'll have a lot more control than\nwhat we used to have, all right?\n\n140\n00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,910\nLet me show you an example of a policy.\n\n141\n00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,020\nI know this bleeds into the next objective\na little bit but I'll show you anyway.\n\n142\n00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,660\nIf I go back to my admin panel, and\n\n143\n00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,935\nI go to More Controls, I'll see some\nof my different controls that I've got.\n\n144\n00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:39,774\nAnd I'm looking for my, let's see what\nwould be a good one to mess with?\n\n145\n00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,430\nI don't want to mess anything up too much.\n\n146\n00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,420\nWell, let's go to Admin Roles, right?\n\n147\n00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,524\nWhen we create an admin role,\nI can make somebody a group admin or\n\n148\n00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:49,746\na help desk admin.\n\n149\n00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:54,487\nAnd normally, I'm making them a help desk\nadmin for the ITProTV organization, for\n\n150\n00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,990\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n151\n00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,340\nBut, now that I've got sub-organizations,\nI can change that.\n\n152\n00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,240\nMaybe I want Marty Friedman to be a help\ndesk admin, but just for the contractors.\n\n153\n00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,710\nI want him to be the liaison for\nthe contractors, so\n\n154\n00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,460\nI want him to manage those accounts.\n\n155\n00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,340\nSo I might take his account and\n\n156\n00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,160\nmodify it so that he's not\nattached to all organizations, but\n\n157\n00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,650\nis instead attached to just particular\norganizations like Contractors.\n\n158\n00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,680\nOr I might want to add somebody else in\nhere, I'll add in, who else do we have?\n\n159\n00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,230\nWe can do Nick Menza.\n\n160\n00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,870\nSo I'll bring in Nick.\n\n161\n00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,200\nAnd I'm gonna give him admin\nrights on Contractors.\n\n162\n00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,098\nAnd when I choose that, it's gonna\nautomatically trickle down to include\n\n163\n00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,290\nEdutainmentLIVE and Halliburton,\nso I'll give him those.\n\n164\n00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,340\nAnd now, he's a help desk admin.\n\n165\n00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,790\nI see him right in the list, but\n\n166\n00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,320\nI've limited the organizations\nthat he has attached.\n\n167\n00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,490\nAll right, so that's a neat way that we\ncan make a use of these organizations.\n\n168\n00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,760\nWe can do it for permissions.\n\n169\n00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,280\nWe can do it for other things too.\n\n170\n00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,880\nWhen we get to the policy side,\nwe'll see that.\n\n171\n00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,760\nAnd just to look at that real quick, if we\ntake a quick glance at something like our,\n\n172\n00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,201\nwhat would be a good one to look at?\n\n173\n00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,132\nWell, shoot,\nI don't want to step on my toes for\n\n174\n00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,610\nsome of the other objectives\nthat we're gonna get into.\n\n175\n00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,960\nBut just something simple,\nlike turning on and off services.\n\n176\n00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,471\nSo if I go into Google Apps and\nI take something like Mobile.\n\n177\n00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:23,480\nSo there's the Mobile I was\ntalking about right here.\n\n178\n00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,240\nThese are all my device\nmanagement settings.\n\n179\n00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,500\nAnd we'll start to see the device\nmanagement settings in here.\n\n180\n00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,400\nAnd notice on the left,\nI can pick my organizations.\n\n181\n00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,610\nSo at the ITProTV level, this is where\nthese settings are locally applied.\n\n182\n00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,790\nSee how it says that right there,\nlocally applied?\n\n183\n00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,780\nThis is where the setting is put in place.\n\n184\n00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,477\nBut for all of those\nsub-organizations like Contractors,\n\n185\n00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,152\nsee how it says inherited?\n\n186\n00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,904\nThat setting wasn't put right here on\nContractors, it was put on the parent and\n\n187\n00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,170\nit trickled down.\n\n188\n00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,290\nSo if I wanna override that I, can come\nin here and I can start to change it.\n\n189\n00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,440\nAnd if I start to change these things,\nsee how it now says locally applied?\n\n190\n00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,970\nIt's not inherited anymore.\n\n191\n00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,740\nI'm overriding that behavior right\nhere just for these particular users.\n\n192\n00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,428\nIf you don't have a need for this,\nif you don't have a need for\n\n193\n00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:11,250\nseparate policies, then there's not\nreally a need for sub-organizations.\n\n194\n00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,280\nSo, not every company needs that.\n\n195\n00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,658\nBut if you want custom permissions, custom\nroles, or custom policies like these,\n\n196\n00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:21,624\nsub-organizations are the way\nthat we do it.\n\n197\n00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:22,708\nAll right, let's see,\n\n198\n00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,869\nis there anything else that I wanna\ndo while I'm messing around in here?\n\n199\n00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,040\nNo that's about it, right.\n\n200\n00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,470\nFeel like I'm missing something,\nbut [LAUGH] I think I got it all.\n\n201\n00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,590\nJust be aware that once you start\nto create sub-organizations,\n\n202\n00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,620\nit becomes doubly important that every\ntime you go into configure something,\n\n203\n00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,750\nlook for\nthe organization's navigation, right?\n\n204\n00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,230\nBecause you might think you're making\na change for your whole organization, but\n\n205\n00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,260\nyou're actually just making it for a sub.\n\n206\n00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,890\nOr you might think you're making\na change on a sub-organization, but\n\n207\n00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,390\nyou're actually changing it for\nyour whole company.\n\n208\n00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,900\nBe careful about that.\n\n209\n00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,130\nWhen you've got sub-organizations,\n\n210\n00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,470\nyou've gotta pay attention to this\nnavigation bar on the left side.\n\n211\n00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,160\nWhen we start to make changes,\nit's easy to overlook it.\n\n212\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,514\nSo see,\nI was in that Contractors organization.\n\n213\n00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:08,440\nAnd if I go all the way back\nout to my admin console, and\n\n214\n00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,625\nthen I go back into Google Apps,\nand I go back into Mobile,\n\n215\n00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,490\nthen I go in here to start\nworking with device management.\n\n216\n00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,270\nWhen I go in here,\nsee how it remembers I was in Contractors?\n\n217\n00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,500\nSo it remembers that's\nwhat I was working on.\n\n218\n00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,170\nAnd I see locally applied right here,\nso it might be easy for\n\n219\n00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,890\nme to confuse them and think that I'm\nworking on the company, when I'm not.\n\n220\n00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,270\nAnd I need to remember to go over here and\nchoose that.\n\n221\n00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,990\nSo just a caveat, a little word to\nthe wise, easy to make a mistake there.\n\n222\n00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,704\nAnd when you make a change at the company\nlevel, at the parent organization,\n\n223\n00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,420\nit takes effect immediately.\n\n224\n00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,360\nYour end users will get\naffected right away, and\n\n225\n00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,819\nthat's definitely something\nyou want to avoid.\n\n226\n00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:48,570\nAll right, so in this segment we got\na chance to see creating organizations and\n\n227\n00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,200\nhow we can move users in there.\n\n228\n00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,728\nAnd some of the different cool\nthings we can do once we have\n\n229\n00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,860\nsub-organizations in place.\n\n230\n00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,977\nBe sure to stay tuned, we're gonna work\nin organizations in the next segment.\n\n231\n00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:05,784\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14,830\nhave multiple organizations inside\nof our Google apps account.\n\n4\n00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,900\nThe official title is demonstrate how\nto manage Google apps services by\n\n5\n00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,195\norganizational unit.\n\n6\n00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:24,100\nAnd basically what they're saying is,\nwhen you set up a Google apps account\n\n7\n00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,920\nthere are a number of services\nthat you're enabling, right.\n\n8\n00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,248\nAnd we all think of Gmail and Drive\nbecause those are the two big ones, right.\n\n9\n00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:35,490\nBut, there's plenty of other things like\nCalendar and YouTube, and Blogger, and\n\n10\n00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,530\nall these other different services\nthat are a part of Google apps.\n\n11\n00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,900\nWell, when you have multiple\nsub-organizations, you can turn these\n\n12\n00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,380\nservices on or off for different sets\nof users, and that's really handy.\n\n13\n00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,530\nIf you don't use sub-organizations,\nyou just have one big organization,\n\n14\n00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,360\nyou can turn the apps on or\noff for the entire company.\n\n15\n00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,330\nBut when you have sub-organizations,\nyou get a lot more control.\n\n16\n00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,160\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n17\n00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,640\nHere in my admin panel if\nI got into Google Apps,\n\n18\n00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,780\nright in here I'll get a list of\nthe primary applications that pretty much\n\n19\n00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,790\nevery company's gonna take advantage of.\n\n20\n00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,440\nAnd notice the status on the right side.\n\n21\n00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,050\nYou're normally gonna see\none of three statuses.\n\n22\n00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,050\nOn for everyone as the default for\nthe core services.\n\n23\n00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,170\nThat means everyone in your company and\n\n24\n00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,940\nevery sub-organization is allowed to\nuse this particular service, right.\n\n25\n00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,560\nSo Calendar, Contacts,\nDrive, those are big ones,\n\n26\n00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,060\nthose are ones that we\nwant our company to use.\n\n27\n00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,757\nYou may see other ones that say on for\nsome organizations,\n\n28\n00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:35,919\nand that means that we've done\na little pick and choose, right.\n\n29\n00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:40,980\nWe've picked some of our sub-organizations\nto have it, and some not to have it.\n\n30\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,980\nAnd then a third option is just off.\n\n31\n00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,040\nWe may have disabled it outright and\n\n32\n00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,510\nnobody in the company is able to use it,\nall right.\n\n33\n00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,600\nSo we can go through and\nstart to change that.\n\n34\n00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,050\nNow, if you are not using organizations,\nand you just have one,\n\n35\n00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,530\nthen there's really only two options\nthat matter, on for everyone, or off.\n\n36\n00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,820\nBut if you have some sub-organizations,\nthat's where the on for\n\n37\n00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,650\nsome organizations becomes really handy,\nand we start to pick.\n\n38\n00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,470\nSo let's take, for example,\nGoogle Hangouts right here.\n\n39\n00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,820\nThis allows employees to be able to chat,\nas well as place video calls,\n\n40\n00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,070\na lot of powerful stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,580\nYou can use it for group meetings.\n\n42\n00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,330\nIt's a wonderful collaborative tool.\n\n43\n00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,890\nWe use it here at ITProTV all the time.\n\n44\n00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,138\nBut maybe you're one of those companies\nthat's a little more Draconian, right.\n\n45\n00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:25,070\n[LAUGH] And you don't want your\nemployees chatting or talking.\n\n46\n00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,590\nOr maybe it's the contractors.\n\n47\n00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,640\nYou don't want the contractors\nplacing video calls, right.\n\n48\n00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,190\nWell, we can go in and\neither outright turn this off, or\n\n49\n00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,390\nwe could choose to make it where\nthe contractors aren't able to use it.\n\n50\n00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,690\nIf I click on Talk/Hangouts,\nit'll pull up this list, and\n\n51\n00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,090\nI can see right here under the picture,\nwhere it says on for everyone.\n\n52\n00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,092\nAnd if I drop that down,\nhere's my three choices, on for everyone,\n\n53\n00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,892\nwhich is what's the default.\n\n54\n00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:54,371\nOff, so just nobody's gonna be able to use\nit, and you'll see here it's warning me\n\n55\n00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:58,680\nthat's gonna be a problem because of\nhow integrated it is with Google Plus.\n\n56\n00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,390\nSo it's telling me that if I turn this off\nI may have some issues to deal with there.\n\n57\n00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,800\nI'm gonna cancel that.\n\n58\n00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,600\nThe other option is,\non for some organizations.\n\n59\n00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,300\nAnd now it's gonna give\nme the chance to choose.\n\n60\n00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,720\nAnd I'll see that ITProTV has my master\nsetting and the master setting is on.\n\n61\n00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,770\nAnd the other guys, contractors,\nretired, these guys are all inheriting,\n\n62\n00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,430\nand so I can go through and start to\nchange that if I want, wherever I choose.\n\n63\n00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,570\nMaybe I want the Halliburton guys not to\nbe able to use it, so I'll go up here and\n\n64\n00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,900\nI'm gonna choose to override it, and\n\n65\n00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,550\nthen once we've chosen to override it,\nwe'll be able to flip that to off.\n\n66\n00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,560\nSo see a Halliburton is set to override,\nand now I can flip it to off, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,990\nAnd it takes just a second\nto recognize what I've done.\n\n68\n00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,290\nIt's giving me that Google Plus\nwarning again, but it's just for\n\n69\n00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,790\nthe Halliburton guy, so\nwhat do I care there?\n\n70\n00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,770\nAnd so I've got it set, all right.\n\n71\n00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,360\nSo I had to block the inheritants first,\nand then I was able to turn it off.\n\n72\n00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,310\nNotice that Entertainment Live\nstill has it,\n\n73\n00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,350\nbecause it's inheriting it from\ncontractors, which inherits from ITProTV.\n\n74\n00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,590\nIf I wanted to turn it off for\nall of my contractors,\n\n75\n00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,740\nI'd need to do it here at this level.\n\n76\n00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,310\nAnd notice how I can't turn it off\nuntil I do that override, so I've gotta\n\n77\n00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,032\noverride it first, and apply that, and\nthen I can turn it off right there.\n\n78\n00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:27,210\nAll right, so now with that being\nturned off I'll see that it's off for\n\n79\n00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,120\nthe contractors and Entertainment Live\nsays inherited still, right.\n\n80\n00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,820\nBut if I click on them I'll see\nit's inheriting that it's off.\n\n81\n00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,260\nI could actually turn it back on on\nEntertainment Live if I went and\n\n82\n00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,060\noverrode its inheritance, and\nturned it back on right there.\n\n83\n00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,670\nSo you've really got a lot of flexibility.\n\n84\n00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,880\nBy doing this,\nmy ITProTV organization still has it,\n\n85\n00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,050\nmy retired personnel still have it,\nbut my contractors and\n\n86\n00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,680\neach of the organizations inside of it,\ndon't have it.\n\n87\n00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,210\nSo, this situation is what we call,\non for some organizations.\n\n88\n00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,040\nSome have it, some don't, all right.\n\n89\n00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,950\nNow they can't display that in\na nice little green bar here so\n\n90\n00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,710\nyou'll see the link that appeared,\nview the status for each org,\n\n91\n00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,710\nand if you click on that you'll just get\nthat management screen where you can see\n\n92\n00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,600\nwhether it's turned on or\noff for each one.\n\n93\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,490\nSo pretty straightforward,\nreally neat way to handle that and\n\n94\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,400\nif I go back out to my Google Apps\nService Screen, we can do that for\n\n95\n00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,010\nanyone of these and\nyou'll see it change, right.\n\n96\n00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,660\nSo like Talk/Hangouts.\n\n97\n00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,520\nOn for selected orgs right there,\nand we can modify it.\n\n98\n00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,150\nNow, these are the core services.\n\n99\n00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,050\nDon't forget all of the other services\nthat are just not considered core.\n\n100\n00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,555\nIf I go back to my admin console and\nI go to to more controls.\n\n101\n00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:44,805\nIn here you'll see more Google apps.\n\n102\n00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,265\nThese are the non-core ones.\n\n103\n00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,267\nSo here's Blogger, Google Ad Sense,\nAd Words, Analytics,\n\n104\n00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,830\nall these other guys Google Plus,\nYouTube, right.\n\n105\n00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,927\nAnd we can do the exact same thing for\nthese guys.\n\n106\n00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,715\nWe can turn them on or off.\n\n107\n00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:01,128\nSo, those contractors,\nI don't want them to go to YouTube.\n\n108\n00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,974\nSo I can go to YouTube and I can\nchoose on for some organizations, and\n\n109\n00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:09,970\nI can kind of repeat the process here,\noverriding it for\n\n110\n00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,553\ncontractors and\nthen turning it off, all right.\n\n111\n00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,700\nSo it's just letting me know\nit's gonna turn it off, and\n\n112\n00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,744\nit may take up to 24 hours to apply.\n\n113\n00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:22,260\nBe aware of that, there's a lot of cookies\nand sessions that are already in place.\n\n114\n00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,390\nAnd Google, you might not know this but\nthey've got a lot of servers, they've got\n\n115\n00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,000\nthousands of servers all across the world,\nyou guys already know that.\n\n116\n00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,370\nSo it takes awhile to get that\nsynchronized across all of their systems.\n\n117\n00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,660\nThat's why I warned you that\nit may take up to 24 hours.\n\n118\n00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,880\nIt's normally much faster but\njust plan on 24 hours and\n\n119\n00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,190\nyou'll never be disappointed, right.\n\n120\n00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,090\nSo that's our goal there but\nnow I've got that overridden and\n\n121\n00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,920\nmy contractors won't be\nable to use YouTube.\n\n122\n00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,770\nThey might still be able to browse to the\nYouTube website and watch stuff, but they\n\n123\n00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,360\nwon't be able to log in with their account\nthat's created through our Google apps.\n\n124\n00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,020\nNow you might ask yourself well,\n\n125\n00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,650\nwhat's the point there if you're\nnot going to block the access?\n\n126\n00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,450\nWell, what your preventing is, your\npreventing them from logging in with their\n\n127\n00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,690\ncompany account and posting videos or\ndoing inappropriate things, commenting, or\n\n128\n00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,470\nwhatever with a company account.\n\n129\n00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,770\nThey won't be able to do that.\n\n130\n00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,450\nThey can log out and\nlog in with their personal account,\n\n131\n00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,450\ndo whatever the heck they want,\nthat's their own problem, right.\n\n132\n00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,870\nWell, from the company side, we've\nisolated ourselves from their activities.\n\n133\n00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,970\nSo, that's really\nthe whole purpose of this.\n\n134\n00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,540\nYou can put other\ncontrols in place to stop\n\n135\n00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,392\nthem from even getting to the website,\nif you want.\n\n136\n00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:28,530\nAll right, so, in this segment, we got\na chance to see how we can use those\n\n137\n00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,680\norganizational units to manage the access\nfor an individual organizational unit.\n\n138\n00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,220\nWe saw some of the services that\nwe can turn on and off, and\n\n139\n00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,110\nthe different options that\nare available for each.\n\n140\n00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,650\nAll right I hope you guys\nenjoyed that segment.\n\n141\n00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,413\nStay tuned, we've got more Google\napp segments coming up after this.\n\n142\n00:07:45,413 -->

00:00:16,110\norganizational level settings for\nGoogle Apps services.\n\n4\n00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,990\nThat's quite a mouthful.\n\n5\n00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,290\nWhat they're actually saying there is\nhow to turn on various services, or\n\n6\n00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,990\nturn off various services,\nwithin our organization.\n\n7\n00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,810\nAnd we've kind of already seen that,\nright?\n\n8\n00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,400\nWe had a segment where we covered\nhow to turn those things on and off.\n\n9\n00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,880\nSo what we really need to\nfocus here is on how to\n\n10\n00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,790\nadd new services to our environment.\n\n11\n00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,180\nNow what do I mean by that?\n\n12\n00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,418\nWell, Google is constantly\ndeveloping new solutions, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:40,990\nNew things come out and\nsometimes old things go away.\n\n14\n00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,000\nThere might be a Google Wave that\ncame out and you could choose\n\n15\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,080\nto add that to your Google Apps if you\nwanted or not and then it went away.\n\n16\n00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,935\nSo new services come out, how do we\nattach those to our organization and\n\n17\n00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,871\nour sub-organizations and so on?\n\n18\n00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:59,506\nRight, well the first thing we need to\ndo is we need to determine how we wanna\n\n19\n00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,880\nhandle this from a general perspective.\n\n20\n00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,157\nAnd then we can go in and\n\n21\n00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:06,874\ndeal with it from a individual app\nsetting level if we want right.\n\n22\n00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:08,840\nSo let's just start from the big picture.\n\n23\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,410\nWhen you log in to your admin console\nyou can go into your company profile.\n\n24\n00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,100\nAnd inside of your company profile there's\ntwo settings we wanna look for, all right.\n\n25\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,651\nAs we start to peek in here you'll see\nsome information about your company.\n\n26\n00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,880\nJust your real general information.\n\n27\n00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,060\nBut as we scroll down you'll find\nthis section here, New user features.\n\n28\n00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,830\nAnd under New user features we've\ngot some radio buttons here.\n\n29\n00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,810\nWe can pick between two\ndifferent release schedules.\n\n30\n00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,890\nWhen new updates come out when\nthere's a new feature in Gmail or\n\n31\n00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,890\na new feature in Google Calendar or\n\n32\n00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,080\nwhatever, do you wanna get it right away,\nthe day it becomes available?\n\n33\n00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,150\nOr do you wanna wait a little bit?\n\n34\n00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,060\nDo you wanna slowly go into it?\n\n35\n00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,960\nNow, this is not a new service altogether,\nthis is just like a new feature.\n\n36\n00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,880\nSo if some new feature comes out in Gmail,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,260\nA great example would be a few months ago\nwhen Google release the new tabbed inbox.\n\n38\n00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,049\nUsed to be that you had one inbox and\n\n39\n00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,710\nall of your new email was\nright there in your inbox.\n\n40\n00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,139\nNow you have tabs so you have bulk mail or\nadvertising, marketing you know those\n\n41\n00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,450\nkind of tabs in addition to your higher\npriority email or the priority inbox.\n\n42\n00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,429\nThat was another example of a new\nfeature that Google rolled out.\n\n43\n00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:25,100\nGmail was an existing service,\nbut these were new features.\n\n44\n00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,652\nIf you choose Rapid release,\n\n45\n00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:30,882\nthe moment a new feature is released it\nwill be activated for your organization.\n\n46\n00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:33,325\nYour people will have that feature,\nall right.\n\n47\n00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,517\nBut if you choose Scheduled release,\nwhat that does is,\n\n48\n00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:38,720\nit doesn't let you pick the schedule.\n\n49\n00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,900\nGoogle picks it.\n\n50\n00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,860\nBut, it'll wait a few weeks.\n\n51\n00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,880\nA new feature will come out and\nthen one or\n\n52\n00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,500\ntwo weeks will pass before it\nenables it for your organization.\n\n53\n00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,620\nThat's the default.\n\n54\n00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,813\nAnd the idea is that you have a great\nbig public release across the world,\n\n55\n00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:57,573\nand any little quirks or bugs kind of work\nthemselves out in that first week or two.\n\n56\n00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:01,392\nAnd then it rolls out to environments like\nyours that are business related where\n\n57\n00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:04,590\nthey're a little more sensitive\nto change like that, all right.\n\n58\n00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,910\nNow that's just features, if we keep\nscrolling down you'll find New products.\n\n59\n00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,085\nThis is when the add an entirely new\nservice, so something like Google Wave.\n\n60\n00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:19,662\nThat was a new product that got added,\nthat was brought in, and you could choose\n\n61\n00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:23,980\nwhether you wanted to make that\navailable to your accounts or not.\n\n62\n00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,520\nRight?\n\n63\n00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,040\nThe default is automatic.\n\n64\n00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,120\nAnd that means when a new service is\nreleased, it'll be enabled for your users.\n\n65\n00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,660\nBut you might not want that.\n\n66\n00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,060\nYou might want to pre-approve these\nservices cuz if it's a new service,\n\n67\n00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,860\nit's something you're\ngonna have to manage.\n\n68\n00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,570\nAnd so you wanna make sure that you've\ngot the infrastructure in place.\n\n69\n00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,880\nThat you've adjusted\npermissions as necessary.\n\n70\n00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,420\nYou've done your security\nreview to determine whether or\n\n71\n00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,150\nnot you have any compliance or\n\n72\n00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,820\nregulation type issues that might\ninterfere with you using that service.\n\n73\n00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,580\nSo if that's your scenario,\nyou wanna go Manual.\n\n74\n00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,091\nWhen you choose Manual that says,\ngreat, Google released a new service.\n\n75\n00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:59,090\nThat's wonderful, but don't turn it on.\n\n76\n00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,430\nJust leave it turned off.\n\n77\n00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,390\nWe'll do our research,\nfind out if we're ready for\n\n78\n00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,480\nit, and then we'll manually\nadd it when we're ready.\n\n79\n00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,960\nIf you choose Automatic,\nthe services automatically be added,\n\n80\n00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,650\nyou don't have to do anything, right?\n\n81\n00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,819\nThat's why they call it Automatic, right?\n\n82\n00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,890\nIt just happens, it's done, and that's it.\n\n83\n00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,343\nIf you choose Manual, though,\nwhen you choose that, I'll go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,841\nput my name in the Manual and\nI'll hit save changes.\n\n85\n00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:27,390\nNow if Google releases some great new\nservice, well, I'm not gonna have it.\n\n86\n00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,081\nWhen I go under my Google Apps core\nservices here I'm not gonna have whatever\n\n87\n00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,450\nthis new service is, or\nif I go down to More controls and\n\n88\n00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,635\nMore Google Apps that I\nwon't have it here either.\n\n89\n00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:42,616\nIt's new, it's out but I don't have it.\n\n90\n00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,940\nSo, if that's the case,\nI can manually add it in.\n\n91\n00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,430\nThe way you do that is with this little\nsquare button up here that has a plus sign\n\n92\n00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,400\nbeside it, it's the Add services button.\n\n93\n00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400\nAnd you'll see I have it here under\nthe more Google Apps screen, but\n\n94\n00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,080\nif I go back to just the regular\nGoogle Apps screen, I've got it there too.\n\n95\n00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,330\nIt's the same thing.\n\n96\n00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,360\nWe're gonna add that service in.\n\n97\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,799\nSo if you chose Manual,\nthis is how you do it.\n\n98\n00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:08,423\nYou never know,\n\n99\n00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:11,641\nthere might already be some services that\nare outstanding that you're not aware of.\n\n100\n00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:15,554\nYou can hit that, and it'll take you to\na screen where you can see the different\n\n101\n00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:17,460\nservices that are available.\n\n102\n00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,450\nOne of the big ones is Groups for\nBusiness.\n\n103\n00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,260\nWe're gonna take a look at that\none in another segment where we\n\n104\n00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,960\ntackle that specifically.\n\n105\n00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,900\nThat's one that I almost always go in and\nadd.\n\n106\n00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,460\nAnd so if we wanna add Groups for\nBusiness, we can hit Add it now.\n\n107\n00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,670\nAnd now that service will be available.\n\n108\n00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,195\nI can still go back and turn it on and\noff from my organization and\n\n109\n00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,140\nsub-organizations like we\nsaw in that earlier segment,\n\n110\n00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,310\nbut it's just added to my organization\nthen I can go and customize it.\n\n111\n00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,227\nYou'll see some other things,\nlike these are paid services down here.\n\n112\n00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:52,071\nGoogle My Maps Pro, additional Google\nDrive storage, if your end users need\n\n113\n00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:56,960\nmore storage than what they've got,\nthe Google Apps for Work unlimited.\n\n114\n00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,682\nI know I mentioned that\nin another segment.\n\n115\n00:05:58,682 --> 00:05:59,889\nWe can turn that feature on.\n\n116\n00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,730\nAnd you'll see it's got a free\ntrial you can do if you want.\n\n117\n00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,610\nAnd then Google Vault, and Google Vault\nis really cool if you have any kind\n\n118\n00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,560\nof regulatory or compliance requirements\nthat make you do e-discovery.\n\n119\n00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,790\nIf you need to be able to search across\nall of your documents and e-mail and\n\n120\n00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,750\npull data out of it and make sure you\nretain it for certain periods of time.\n\n121\n00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,908\nThey have that functionality and\nyou can add that in and turn it on.\n\n122\n00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,266\nNot everybody has a need for that.\n\n123\n00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,516\nSo it's not turned on by default.\n\n124\n00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,750\nIt's just sitting here\non the side all right.\n\n125\n00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,560\nAnd then down on here at the bottom\nyou'll see where you can\n\n126\n00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,320\nenable the Google Apps Marketplace\nwhere you can go and\n\n127\n00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,920\nhave access to tons of\nother Google Apps services.\n\n128\n00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,580\nThat aren't from Google, but\n\n129\n00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,870\nby independent third parties that\nhave written these applications.\n\n130\n00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,980\nAnd there's a ton of cool stuff in there.\n\n131\n00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,181\nThings like project management\nsoftware and task management,\n\n132\n00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:46,907\nall sorts of workflow type stuff.\n\n133\n00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,532\nReally, really neat, but\nit's not Google, and so\n\n134\n00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,873\nthat's why they don't\nturn it on by default.\n\n135\n00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:55,025\nYou can go and turn it on and\ngo find those different items.\n\n136\n00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,105\nAnd then if you're using\nGoogle App Engine,\n\n137\n00:06:57,105 --> 00:07:00,375\nwhere you develop your\nown Google Apps services,\n\n138\n00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,495\nyou can add those right here by\nentering in your Google App ID.\n\n139\n00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:07,355\nYou punch that in and it'll be\nattached to your Google Apps account.\n\n140\n00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:10,345\nAnd because it's a published app you could\nactually make it available to other people\n\n141\n00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:13,190\nif you wanted In\nthe Google App Marketplace or\n\n142\n00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,100\nyou can do it manually through the app ID,\neither way.\n\n143\n00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,110\nBut these are the ways\nthat we add new services.\n\n144\n00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,203\nNow if you didn't see the other segment\nwhere we covered how to turn them on and\n\n145\n00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:23,927\noff, let me just recap that real quickly.\n\n146\n00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:27,000\nIf you did see the other segment,\nyou can stop here.\n\n147\n00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,320\nBut once we have a service enabled\nyou can go into Google Apps and\n\n148\n00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,450\nfind the service that\nyou want to work with.\n\n149\n00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,640\nAnd so I'll go into like Calendar.\n\n150\n00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,410\nAnd inside of the Calendar\nis where we can adjust.\n\n151\n00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,080\nHere it's on for everyone and we can\nchange that to on for some organizations.\n\n152\n00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,360\nSo when I add a new service, I can go and\nadjust the settings right here,\n\n153\n00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,830\nto turn it on or off for my main\norganization and the child organizations,\n\n154\n00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,730\nthe sub orgs that we have throughout.\n\n155\n00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,213\nSo, easy enough to tweak\nthat to meet our needs.\n\n156\n00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:03,630\nAll right, so in this segment we got to\ntake a look at how we can automatically\n\n157\n00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,847\ndeploy new services and Google Apps.\n\n158\n00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:09,893\nAnd how we can manually deploy them if we\nchoose to just want to have that time to\n\n159\n00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,670\nevaluate the service\nbefore we roll it out.\n\n160\n00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,280\nWe also saw to automatically\n\n161\n00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,580\nright away deploy new features or to do a\nlittle delay, a one or two week delay when\n\n162\n00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,670\na new feature is released before\nrolling it out in our environment.\n\n163\n00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,660\nAll good stuff to help ensure that you\nhave a smooth roll-out of services\n\n164\n00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,370\nto your end users.\n\n165\n00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,860\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n166\n00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,964\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Google Apps coming up.\n\n167\n00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:40,229\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,250\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:13,060\nObjective 3.2 covers Chrome policies for\ndevices and users.\n\n3\n00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,770\nIn fact that's kind of the official title.\n\n4\n00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,990\nDemonstrate how to use Chrome policies for\ndevices and users.\n\n5\n00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,590\nNow, what the heck are Chrome policies?\n\n6\n00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,800\nWell, I know I've mentioned policies in\nsome of the other segments, but if you\n\n7\n00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,860\nhaven't seen those, basically policies\nare just a collection of settings.\n\n8\n00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,330\nSettings that we push upon a user to\nchange their experience when they're in\n\n9\n00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,310\nGoogle Chrome and\nwhen they're using Google Apps.\n\n10\n00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,650\nNow there's really two\ndifferent sides to this.\n\n11\n00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,210\nThere's one set of policies that we\napply with in our Google Apps account.\n\n12\n00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,060\nAnd when a user logs in to Google Apps,\nthese policies will apply to them.\n\n13\n00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,370\nThat's the online policy processing and\n\n14\n00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,790\nit's all pooled live from\nthe internet via their account.\n\n15\n00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,040\nThese are pretty awesome.\n\n16\n00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,743\nBecause the changes we make there,\ncan take effect and\n\n17\n00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:58,750\ncross to all our users across the world.\n\n18\n00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,375\nThey don't have to physically come\nto us to get these new settings.\n\n19\n00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,667\nAll right but\nthere's also the offline side of things.\n\n20\n00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,355\nWe might have policies that we\nwant to apply to people that\n\n21\n00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,375\ndon't have a connection to the Internet.\n\n22\n00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,574\nAnd for those people,\nthey're not gonna be able to reach out and\n\n23\n00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:12,840\nget your Google app server.\n\n24\n00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,730\nThey're not gonna be able\nto get those settings.\n\n25\n00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,050\nWe need to be able to see this from both,\nthe online and the offline perspective.\n\n26\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,870\nFor the exam, they're gonna focus\non the online perspectives.\n\n27\n00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,640\nThat's what you really need to know.\n\n28\n00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,420\nBut I want to make sure\nI show you guys both,\n\n29\n00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,200\nbecause in real life land you\nmight see either way all right.\n\n30\n00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120\nSo let's start with the online side.\n\n31\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,100\nFortunately the online\nside is really easy.\n\n32\n00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,080\nWe go into our policy settings here.\n\n33\n00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,750\nAnd the next time users\nlogin they take effect.\n\n34\n00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,746\nAll right so to see those, what we need\nto do is we start your admin console and\n\n35\n00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:45,182\nwe need to go down to More Controls\nbecause what we're looking for\n\n36\n00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,870\nis Chrome Management.\n\n37\n00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,560\nAnd Chrome Management doesn't\nshow up here by default.\n\n38\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,238\nIn fact, you'll find a lot of instructions\nthat will refer to it as going under\n\n39\n00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,708\nGoogle Apps and\nfinding Chrome Management in here.\n\n40\n00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,980\nWell notice I don't\nhave Chrome Management.\n\n41\n00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,640\nWell, you can add it to this screen.\n\n42\n00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,833\nBut I don't usually mess with\nthat because I like consistency.\n\n43\n00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,740\nSo I've just kind of gotten used\nto going down to more controls.\n\n44\n00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,310\nAnd under more controls,\nyou can go to More Google Apps and\n\n45\n00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,040\nyou'll get the full list in here, which\nincludes Chrome Management right there.\n\n46\n00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,090\nSo I'll go to Chrome Management and\n\n47\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,860\nhere's where I can get into start\ndealing with my policy settings.\n\n48\n00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,450\nNow there's two main\npieces that we deal with.\n\n49\n00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,510\nUser Settings and Device Settings.\n\n50\n00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,810\nThe User Settings, like the name implies,\napplies to your user account.\n\n51\n00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,670\nAnd these will affect the user account\nregardless of what device they use.\n\n52\n00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,370\nSo if they're on an Android phone,\nor a Chromebook,\n\n53\n00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,610\nif they're on their Mac laptop,\nor their Windows desktop.\n\n54\n00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,760\nWhen they fire up Chrome and\nconnect up to their Google Apps account,\n\n55\n00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,940\nthese policies will apply to them,\nall right?\n\n56\n00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,940\nSo these settings follow the user,\nnot the device.\n\n57\n00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940\nA device policy is the opposite.\n\n58\n00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,850\nA device policy applies to\nthe physical device, not the user.\n\n59\n00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,320\nSo if I have a Android tablet that's\nbeing managed by my Google Apps account,\n\n60\n00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,990\nI can create device policy settings here\nthat will affect that tablet regardless of\n\n61\n00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,580\nwhether it's me using it or one of\nthe other members of my organization.\n\n62\n00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,630\nTypically we use both.\n\n63\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,920\nBecause there are some things that apply\nto devices and some that apply to users,\n\n64\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,860\nand they're a little bit different.\n\n65\n00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,240\nNow when we configure settings here,\nthese are called policies.\n\n66\n00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,760\nAnd if you read through the documentation,\nyou'll see people refer to policies and\n\n67\n00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,900\npreferences.\n\n68\n00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,970\nPolicies are the things\nthat we enforce and\n\n69\n00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,880\nthe users can't typically override them.\n\n70\n00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440\nA preference is something that we\nset that's more like a default.\n\n71\n00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,690\nThis is their default\nconfiguration in the beginning.\n\n72\n00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,870\nAnd if they want, they can override\nit if they choose, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,625\nBut you'll see that kind of language\nas we go through and look at these.\n\n74\n00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,220\nLet's take a quick look at user settings.\n\n75\n00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,451\nSo inside the user settings you'll see\na whole laundry list of configuration\n\n76\n00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:52,043\noptions.\n\n77\n00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:54,899\nAnd just like we saw in\nsome of the other segments,\n\n78\n00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,060\nwe can customize these\nbased on sub-organizations.\n\n79\n00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,890\nSo I might have really strict policies for\nmy contractors and\n\n80\n00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,240\nmore relaxed policies for\nmy ITProTV employees.\n\n81\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,670\nSo you can kind of pick and\nchoose how you want to go about that.\n\n82\n00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,250\nI'm looking at my organization\nas a whole right now.\n\n83\n00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,087\nAnd you'll see settings like whether\nwe want these settings to apply just to\n\n84\n00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:19,333\nChrome on Android or if we want it\nto do Chrome on iOS also, or both.\n\n85\n00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,757\nYou'll see whether we wanna do\ncustom wallpaper on the devices,\n\n86\n00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:26,927\nhow often the policy refreshes, right,\nthe default there is every six hours,\n\n87\n00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,251\nthat might not, I'm sorry, every three.\n\n88\n00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,042\nWait.\n\n89\n00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,920\n[LAUGH] Yeah, every three hours, sorry.\n\n90\n00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,300\nSo we can specify how often\nwe want that to happen.\n\n91\n00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,980\nMy horrible math skills.\n\n92\n00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,050\nBut you'll see a lot of options in here\nthat tailor how the devices function and\n\n93\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,030\nwork, whether you wanna pre-install\ncertain apps on Android or pre-install\n\n94\n00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,370\ncertain extensions on Chromebooks or\nthe Chrome web browser itself.\n\n95\n00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,201\nWe can completely customize this behavior,\nturning features on,\n\n96\n00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,833\nturning features off,\nbased on what we need.\n\n97\n00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,390\nMaybe you don't want to allow\npeople to use Incognito Mode.\n\n98\n00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,880\nSo we can go in and turn that off.\n\n99\n00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,320\nAnd now anyone this policy applies to\nwill no longer have the option to use\n\n100\n00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,180\nIncognito.\n\n101\n00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,249\nWell, they might have Incognito Mode right\nnow, but because my refresh interval was\n\n102\n00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,708\nset to three hours, sometime in\nthe next three hours they'll refresh.\n\n103\n00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,862\nAnd the Incognito menu\noption will go away and\n\n104\n00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:21,930\nthey'll no longer be able to use that\nwhile they're logged into Google Apps.\n\n105\n00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,830\nIf they remove themselves from Google\nApps, well then that's a different story,\n\n106\n00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,020\nnow they're on their own.\n\n107\n00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,083\nBut while they're under our control,\nthey won't have access to that.\n\n108\n00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,129\nThe ability to clear browser history,\n\n109\n00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,418\nall of these different things that you may\nwant to tweak and modify for your users.\n\n110\n00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:40,335\nThere's not really anything in here\nthat an user couldn't change themselves\n\n111\n00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:40,960\nalready right?\n\n112\n00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,010\nBy going into their settings inside\nof Chrome and using the under\n\n113\n00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,920\nthe hood option, to go in deeper in there,\nbut by setting it here we enforce it.\n\n114\n00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,930\nThese are policy settings that\nare being forced on our user and\n\n115\n00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,270\nthey can't overwrite it.\n\n116\n00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,900\nIf we disable Incognito Mode,\nthat was that option up here.\n\n117\n00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,333\nIf I disable Incognito Mode,\nthey can't just go and turn it back on.\n\n118\n00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,710\nThe policy's enforced.\n\n119\n00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,680\nThey can't do it.\n\n120\n00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,030\nThey can't launch that setting.\n\n121\n00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,300\nReally handy if we're employing\nlarge quantities of Chromebooks or\n\n122\n00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300\nlaptops that are running Google Chrome.\n\n123\n00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,583\nYou can customize this stuff and get a\nconsistent configuration across the board.\n\n124\n00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,470\nAnd you can kinda see where we might\nhave more restrictive settings.\n\n125\n00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,200\nMaybe I'm a school, and so I have\na sub-organization for my students and\n\n126\n00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,380\nanother sub-organization for my staff.\n\n127\n00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,980\nI might want the staff to have\nthe access to be able to do things,\n\n128\n00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,460\nmaybe Incognito Mode or whatever, but\nI don't want the students doing that.\n\n129\n00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,370\nI need to keep track of what they did.\n\n130\n00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,610\nAnd so\nI might have a separate policy for them.\n\n131\n00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,910\nThese are the User Settings.\n\n132\n00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,010\nAnd they're pretty straightforward.\n\n133\n00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,070\nDevice Settings are basically the same.\n\n134\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,839\nIf I go back up to my Chrome Management\nand I go to Device Settings,\n\n135\n00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,120\nwhen I go in here, I'll see options\nthat pertain to the device.\n\n136\n00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,030\nAnd so, you'll see things in here\nlike Verified Access and so on.\n\n137\n00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,040\nNotice that this is a licensed feature and\n\n138\n00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,220\nit's telling me that I must purchase at\nleast one Chrome device license to use it.\n\n139\n00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,370\nThis is a demo account for\nme so I haven't purchased any.\n\n140\n00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,270\nI'll do the demo though.\n\n141\n00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,630\nAnd oh no,\nthey're going to make me contact Sales.\n\n142\n00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,120\nWell anyhow,\nyou can see some of the options here for\n\n143\n00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,210\nsome of the ones that are not completely\ngrayed out or we will in a second.\n\n144\n00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,580\nBut you'll see settings\nthat pertain to the device.\n\n145\n00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,220\nThis is really handy if you're got\ncomputer labs or shared computers.\n\n146\n00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,700\nFor example,\nyou might be a real estate agency.\n\n147\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,760\nWith real estate, your real estate agents,\nthey're out in the field.\n\n148\n00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720\nThey're out showing houses.\n\n149\n00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800\nThat's how you make money.\n\n150\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,570\nWhen they come back to the office,\nthey don't need a desk that they sit at\n\n151\n00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,640\neveryday, because they're\nsupposed to be out in the field.\n\n152\n00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,400\nSo they may use shared computers, or\nin a school you might have a computer lab.\n\n153\n00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,250\nYou don't know which computer\na particular student is gonna sit on.\n\n154\n00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,520\nThey can sit on any of them, right?\n\n155\n00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,270\nYou create a device setting policy and\nthat will control that.\n\n156\n00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,460\nYou can turn things on and off, like cloud\nprinting settings, guest mode and so on.\n\n157\n00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,050\nAnd you have a suite of\nconfiguration options in there\n\n158\n00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,520\njust like he User Settings, all right.\n\n159\n00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,650\nFor you,\nmaybe User Settings are all you need,\n\n160\n00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,660\nand you don't worry about\nthe Device Settings.\n\n161\n00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,710\nBut you may have where you wanna restrict\nusers when they're using particular\n\n162\n00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,170\ncomputers, and not restrict them when\nthey're using other computers, and\n\n163\n00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,430\nyou can't achieve that\nwith just a user policy.\n\n164\n00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,333\nThat's where Device Settings\ncome in handy.\n\n165\n00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:17,660\nNow, both of the ones I just showed you,\nthose are for online policy management.\n\n166\n00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,294\nIf you want to preconfigure\na machine to have a policy,\n\n167\n00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:24,459\nor have offline policy application,\nyou can.\n\n168\n00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,960\nYou can still do it, alright?\n\n169\n00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,360\nThe exam will really dive into it,\nbut in real life then, you can do it.\n\n170\n00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,790\nWe have, what's called, Chrome for Work.\n\n171\n00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,800\nChrome for Work is Google Chrome\nyou can deploy on machines and\n\n172\n00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,070\nthat you can manage with policies.\n\n173\n00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,370\nIn a Windows environment you're going to\nuse the Microsoft active directory group\n\n174\n00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,500\npolicy objects or local group policy\nobjects on a Windows machine to manage it.\n\n175\n00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,601\nOn a Mac, you actually have a plist,\na preference list file,\n\n176\n00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:54,130\nthat you can define that\ncontains these service settings.\n\n177\n00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,542\nAnd so\nwe can push those out to the machines.\n\n178\n00:08:56,542 --> 00:09:00,486\nI'll post a couple of links with\nthe show notes for this episode, but\n\n179\n00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:04,500\nbasically it's just kind of indicating\nhow to set up Chrome for Work.\n\n180\n00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,130\nThe main things to remember is for Windows\nyou can't just do a normal Chrome install.\n\n181\n00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,240\nIf you go to Google's website and install\nChrome by going to like google.com/chrome.\n\n182\n00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,900\nIt installs in that user's profile.\n\n183\n00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,520\nIt doesn't install for\nall the users on the computer.\n\n184\n00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,500\nSo they actually have a special MSI\nfile that you can use to download it.\n\n185\n00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,770\nThat's a Microsoft installer.\n\n186\n00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,040\nSee how it's got that right here.\n\n187\n00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,700\nInstall the MSI.\n\n188\n00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700\nAnd so,\nthere's a link to download that MSI,\n\n189\n00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,800\nand when it installs,\nit will install for all of your users.\n\n190\n00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,420\nSo that's requirement\nnumber one on Windows.\n\n191\n00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,250\nLinux and Mac, they aren't like that.\n\n192\n00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,290\nWith Linux and Mac, when you install\nit it is installed for all users, so\n\n193\n00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,480\nit's fine for them, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,980\nThe next piece is the policies themselves.\n\n195\n00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,220\nAnd for Chrome for Work,\nGoogle actually has device and\n\n196\n00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,640\nuser based policies that you\ncan download right here.\n\n197\n00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,880\nGroup policies for windows and master\npreference files for Mac OS and Cromebook.\n\n198\n00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,370\nFor Windows you download these ADM and\nADMX files.\n\n199\n00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,060\nI don't wanna get too deep in to it cuz\nthis isn't like an active directory\n\n200\n00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,550\nsegment or whatever.\n\n201\n00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,120\nBut they provide those policy settings so\n\n202\n00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,400\nthat you can apply them in the Windows\nenvironment, either as preferences so\n\n203\n00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,860\nthat users can override them, or\nas policies so that they are enforced.\n\n204\n00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,000\nOn the Mac side, you just craft\na little master_preferences file.\n\n205\n00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,458\nLet me show you an example of that.\n\n206\n00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,500\nI wrote one up, let's see,\naround here somewhere.\n\n207\n00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,370\nHere we go.\n\n208\n00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,760\nThis is an example of what\na master_preferences file might look like.\n\n209\n00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,300\nIt's just written in a simple notation\nthat says what the settings are.\n\n210\n00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,210\nSo here I'm setting a homepage to\nITProTV and I'm setting the browser\n\n211\n00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,300\nto show the home button up in\nthe title bar instead of hiding it.\n\n212\n00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,000\nSo you can start to put those and\nyou just set it up as a little text file.\n\n213\n00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,395\nAnd you stuff it away with the browser,\n\n214\n00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:54,114\neither in the folder the browser installed\ninto for Windows, or in a plist for\n\n215\n00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:57,540\na MAC file,\nright in that little preference list file.\n\n216\n00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,010\nAll right, I’ll post these notes,\nagain you won’t see it on the exam, but\n\n217\n00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,210\nin real life land you might\nhave a need for this.\n\n218\n00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,634\nThe policies, doing them online is really\nideal, because we set them right there,\n\n219\n00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,458\nin our Google Apps admin console.\n\n220\n00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,810\nAnd it makes life a lot easier.\n\n221\n00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,050\nBut if we can't,\nif we have to do it offline,\n\n222\n00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,205\nthese are the other tools\nthat are available for us.\n\n223\n00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:22,395\nAll right, I think that's\npretty much it for that one.\n\n224\n00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:27,130\nBefore you take the exam make sure you\nbrowse through the policy settings to get\n\n225\n00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,292\nfamiliar with what all is in there.\n\n226\n00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:32,125\nIf we go under user settings,\nyou'll see all those different options.\n\n227\n00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,382\nJust kind of read through it.\n\n228\n00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,902\nRead through it at least once so\nyou're familiar with the options.\n\n229\n00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,167\nThere's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n230\n00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:42,039\nIt's really cool, and it's nice to be able\nto create that consistent configuration\n\n231\n00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,333\nacross your devices.\n\n232\n00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,731\nSo that users know what to\nexpect when they log in.\n\n233\n00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,958\nIt is a nice feature to have.\n\n234\n00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,583\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,411\nSo in this segment we got a chance\nto take a look at user policy and\n\n236\n00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,021\ndevice policy settings in Google Apps for\nonline use.\n\n237\n00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,911\nAnd we talked a little bit about\noffline policy generation and\n\n238\n00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,450\nsome of the features that are there.\n\n239\n00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,108\nJust remember,\n\n240\n00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:04,125\nI am gonna post some links to articles\nalong with the show notes for this one.\n\n241\n00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,250\nThey're a good read to take a look at\nif you're deploying this in production.\n\n242\n00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,935\nBut for the exam,\n\n243\n00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,875\nwe've pretty much covered pretty much\neverything you could expect to see.\n\n244\n00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,600\nAll right, I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n245\n00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,500\nBe sure to stick with us.\n\n246\n00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,833\nWe've got more Google Apps\nsegments coming up.\n\n247\n00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:23,030\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,346 --> 00:00:08,190\n[SOUND]\nFor\n\n2\n00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,737\nObjective 3.1, we're gonna take our first\nlook at Google Drive Storage inside of our\n\n3\n00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:14,200\nGoogle Apps account.\n\n4\n00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,210\nThe official objective is, demonstrate\nhow to configure sharing settings.\n\n5\n00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,670\nAnd the storage requirements [LAUGH] for\na Drive.\n\n6\n00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,660\nSo Google Drive,\nit's a core service of Google Apps.\n\n7\n00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,410\nWhen you sign up for Google Apps,\n\n8\n00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,470\neach of your users will get a minimum\nof 30 gigabytes of storage each.\n\n9\n00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,300\nI say minimum because there are different\ntiers of service with Google.\n\n10\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,020\nMost of us when we sign up,\nwe're just gonna go on that normal tier,\n\n11\n00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,310\nand you get 30 gigs.\n\n12\n00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,630\nBut they do have\nthe Google Unlimited licenses now.\n\n13\n00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,880\nAnd with those, they're a little,\nI'm gonna say it's strange.\n\n14\n00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,180\nNot strange in a bad way.\n\n15\n00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,580\nBut if you have a small organization,\njust one to four users, and\n\n16\n00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,180\nyou go Google Unlimited, you actually get\none terabyte of storage for each user.\n\n17\n00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,190\nSo up to four users,\nyou just get this one terabyte per user.\n\n18\n00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,790\nAfter that though,\nwhen you get to five users, and more,\n\n19\n00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,512\nunder Google Unlimited plan,\nit becomes truly unlimited.\n\n20\n00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,115\nYou can have all\nthe storage that you want.\n\n21\n00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:13,400\nSo, when you're leveraging Google drive,\nyou can have a ton of data up there.\n\n22\n00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,370\nWe need to be able to\nkeep a handle on that.\n\n23\n00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,364\nAnd so, there's a few little settings\nthat we need to be aware of,\n\n24\n00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,780\nto tailor the way that our\ncompany uses Google Drive.\n\n25\n00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,200\nFirst off, Google Drive itself\nit's a great Cloud solution.\n\n26\n00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,044\nYou can store your data up on Google\nservers, it's securely transmitted, and\n\n27\n00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:34,610\nencrypted it as it crosses the network,\nso you know your data is safe up there.\n\n28\n00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,790\nYou don't have to worry about backing\nit up, Google takes care of that.\n\n29\n00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,020\nAnd regardless, of what computer you're\nat, you'll have access to your files, so\n\n30\n00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,720\nyou definitely wanna use it.\n\n31\n00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,370\nBut, there are some little problems.\n\n32\n00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,470\nNot problems,\nthey're opportunities for improvement.\n\n33\n00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,410\nSo, [LAUGH] you got to use\nour right terminology.\n\n34\n00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,280\nSo, if you have a bunch of documents\ninside of Google Drive, and\n\n35\n00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,860\nyou hire some contractors that are gonna\nbe working your organization temporarily.\n\n36\n00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,650\nAnd you share documents\nwith those contractors.\n\n37\n00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,870\nWhat can they do?\n\n38\n00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,680\nThey can turn around, and share those\ndocuments outside of the company,\n\n39\n00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,860\nif they wanted.\n\n40\n00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,850\nThat's what Google Drive is all about,\neasy collaboration.\n\n41\n00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,760\nSo, they can share documents to\npeople that you haven't approved.\n\n42\n00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,960\nAnd that can be a problem.\n\n43\n00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,570\nSo, one of the common settings\nwe adjust in Google Drive, is to\n\n44\n00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,600\nchange the way that sharing happens, to\nmodify who you're allowed to share with.\n\n45\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,480\nLet me show you, what I mean.\n\n46\n00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,830\nIf we go into our Admin console,\nand we go under Google Apps.\n\n47\n00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,750\nYou can go under Drive,\nwell after I re-authenticate here,\n\n48\n00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,480\nwe can go under Drive, and in the Drive\nsettings we'll see where we can modify\n\n49\n00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,850\nthe default sharing preferences.\n\n50\n00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,900\nSo I'll just go under Drive,\nand then Sharing settings.\n\n51\n00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,050\nSo right in here, we see a handful of\noptions that pertain to how devices, or\n\n52\n00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,080\nhow files get shared out.\n\n53\n00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,980\nThere's two radio buttons right here,\nthat are primary options.\n\n54\n00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,300\nThe first one is, users cannot share\nfiles outside of this organization.\n\n55\n00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,070\nIf we choose that, our employees will be\nable to share stuff with each other, but\n\n56\n00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,900\nthat's it.\n\n57\n00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,560\nThey won't be able to share to\nanybody outside of the organization.\n\n58\n00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,090\nNow, they could download the file, and\nemail it to somebody as an attachment.\n\n59\n00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,670\nThis doesn't solve that problem.\n\n60\n00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,100\nBut it stops them from direct link\nsharing it, right out of Google Drive.\n\n61\n00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,610\nSo, it'll stop that from happening.\n\n62\n00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,109\nThey'll only be able to share with\npeople inside the organization.\n\n63\n00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,750\nWhen you do that,\nby default they won't be able to\n\n64\n00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,610\nreceive shares from outside\nof the organization either.\n\n65\n00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,310\nSo, you can check this option\nto say let them do that.\n\n66\n00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,590\nThey can't share themselves.\n\n67\n00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,770\nThey can't originate the file themselves,\nbut\n\n68\n00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,980\nthey can receive somebody\nelse's share from the outside.\n\n69\n00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,500\nThe default, though, is users can share\nfiles outside of the organization.\n\n70\n00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,610\nAnd we do normally want that.\n\n71\n00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,620\nWe want people to be able to share\ndocuments outside the organization.\n\n72\n00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,090\nBut we want them to understand the risk,\nthe risk that we have of\n\n73\n00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,560\ndisseminating information that\nthe outsider shouldn't have access to.\n\n74\n00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,620\nSo, you've got the ability\nto turn on a warning.\n\n75\n00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,560\nWarn users when sharing\noutside this organization.\n\n76\n00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,830\nThat is a great thing to have turned on.\n\n77\n00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,160\nWhen they share it, they'll see a message\nwarning them about the risks of sharing\n\n78\n00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,380\ndata outside of the company, and how that\ndata might not be cleared for release.\n\n79\n00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,150\nSo, they just need to be aware of that.\n\n80\n00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,190\nIf you don't want that,\nyou can remove the checkmark, and\n\n81\n00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,440\nthey won't get that warning anymore.\n\n82\n00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,470\nSo, that's completely customizable to you.\n\n83\n00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,910\nYou'll also see,\n\n84\n00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,690\nallow users to share outside the domain to\npeople who are not using a Google account.\n\n85\n00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,780\nNow, that's not turned on by default.\n\n86\n00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,790\nIf you share something, we expect\nthe other person to have a Google account.\n\n87\n00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,210\nBut if you check that, it'll actually\nallow you to share to people that don't.\n\n88\n00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,970\nThey'll be able to view the document, even\nthough they don't have a Google account.\n\n89\n00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,240\nAnd you'll see here, allow users\nto publish files on the web, or\n\n90\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,150\nmake them visible to the world.\n\n91\n00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,190\nThat means make them completely public.\n\n92\n00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,610\nAnd again,\nthat's something you might not want, but\n\n93\n00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,520\nyou can turn on the option right there,\nif you choose.\n\n94\n00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,179\nSo, you've got the ability to control\n\n95\n00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,830\nhow people share things\nout of your organization.\n\n96\n00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,470\nWho's allowed to do what.\n\n97\n00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,040\nRemember, that an administration\ncan override this stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,910\nSo, this is really applying\nto our regular user accounts.\n\n99\n00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,060\nThere are other settings in here.\n\n100\n00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,500\nIf you scroll down a bit,\nyou'll see File Visibility.\n\n101\n00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,600\nSo when files are created,\nwhat's their default Sharing setting?\n\n102\n00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,210\nThe default is they're Private.\n\n103\n00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,730\nIf I go, and create a file,\nonly my account can see it.\n\n104\n00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,010\nAnd then I can choose to share it\nif I want to, but I don't have too.\n\n105\n00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,650\nBut you might have a central repository\nthat you want everybody to see.\n\n106\n00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,325\nIn that scenario you might choose,\nthis organization.\n\n107\n00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:33,000\nWhen you create files by default,\neverybody can see them.\n\n108\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,150\nAnd if you wanna make it private,\nyou'll have to override that, and\n\n109\n00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,640\nmake that file Private.\n\n110\n00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,920\nSo, the default is everybody can see it.\n\n111\n00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,140\nThat gives full visibility\nacross all your employees.\n\n112\n00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,250\nThe middle option is\nkind of an in between.\n\n113\n00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,370\nWhen you create a document,\nit's automatically shared, but\n\n114\n00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,890\nother people don't know about it.\n\n115\n00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,960\nWe have to send them the link.\n\n116\n00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,270\nAnd when they get the link,\nthey can browse to it, and see it.\n\n117\n00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,870\nSo, any employee in the organization\nthat has the link can access it.\n\n118\n00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,590\nBut they can't just browse, and\nfind the documents on there.\n\n119\n00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,710\nThey can't discover it.\n\n120\n00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,380\nWe have to tell them about the document,\nand then they'll be able to get to it.\n\n121\n00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,350\nSo those are our choices.\n\n122\n00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,320\nThe default is private though.\n\n123\n00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,525\nYou may choose to override\nthat in your organization.\n\n124\n00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:15,230\nNow, when I led this segment in,\nI mentioned about storage limits.\n\n125\n00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,840\nLet's say that you're like us.\n\n126\n00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,570\nWell, at ITProTV we use regular accounts,\nand so\n\n127\n00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,881\nour users each get 30 gigs of storage.\n\n128\n00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,990\nHow do I know how much of\nthat storage I've used?\n\n129\n00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,460\nDo I have users that\nare coming up on their limits?\n\n130\n00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,050\nWell, there's some reports that\nare built-in to help us to see that.\n\n131\n00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,960\nIf you go back to your Admin console,\nI've made changes without saving them,\n\n132\n00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,670\nbut I'm okay with that.\n\n133\n00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,990\nIt's gonna make me discard, there we go.\n\n134\n00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,720\nSo, let me go back to my Admin console,\nand if we go into a Reporting screen,\n\n135\n00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,459\nwhich is down here under More Controls,\nand Reports.\n\n136\n00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,670\nThere's a couple of reports that\nare really useful with storage.\n\n137\n00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,200\nThe first one is the Highlights,\nand this is my demo account, so\n\n138\n00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,220\nit doesn't have anything exciting.\n\n139\n00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,620\nLet me switch over to\na Production account.\n\n140\n00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,120\nHere we go.\n\n141\n00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,075\nSo, here's our production account\nthat actually has real-users in it,\n\n142\n00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,220\ndoing a real stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,150\nAnd so, we get this Highlight screen,\nand one of the most useful parts of\n\n144\n00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,060\nthe Highlights screen is over here on the\nright side, you get this Storage section.\n\n145\n00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,660\nAnd it'll show users\nnearing storage limit.\n\n146\n00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,160\nAnd I can see that none of my\nusers are at 80% of the limit,\n\n147\n00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,370\nnone of my users are at 50% of the limit.\n\n148\n00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,410\nBut 12 of my users,\nwe just have 12, are less than 50%.\n\n149\n00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,680\nSo, 12 of my users haven't even\nused half their storage yet, so\n\n150\n00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,470\nI've got plenty of room to grow.\n\n151\n00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,580\nGood to know.\n\n152\n00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,712\nBut how much storage am I using?\n\n153\n00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:42,360\nWell, on the left side,\nif you go to Apps Usage Activity,\n\n154\n00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,950\nthis will show you how much storage\npeople have been generating.\n\n155\n00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,480\nAnd I can see it trended over time.\n\n156\n00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,060\nLook at my growth numbers here.\n\n157\n00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,130\nI can start to evaluate how\nrapidly I'm growing, and\n\n158\n00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,896\nwhen I'm gonna run out of space.\n\n159\n00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:59,390\nAnd not only that, I can see down here\nwho is this consuming the most space,\n\n160\n00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,980\nwho owns the most files, or\nis generating the most emails.\n\n161\n00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,300\nYou've got a little\ndate dropdown box here.\n\n162\n00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,030\nI'm viewing everything as of October 1st.\n\n163\n00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:15,200\nSo, on October 1st, I had 3,900 files,\n\n164\n00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,610\nmost of which were\nmiscellaneous files apparently.\n\n165\n00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,311\nAnd that's where I was at, but just a few\nmonths before, I was down at 2,600 files,\n\n166\n00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:28,290\nor 1,900 files,\nyou can see that growth over time.\n\n167\n00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,860\nWe must have hired somebody new here,\nand they brought a bunch of files in.\n\n168\n00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,910\nSo I got a couple of jumps,\nas people transferred stuff in.\n\n169\n00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,340\nNow this is Files Owned,\nwhat if I want this in megabytes?\n\n170\n00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,240\nWell, I can drop Files Owned down,\nand choose Total Storage Used (MB).\n\n171\n00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,840\nAnd now, I can start to see that\nbig jump that happened right there.\n\n172\n00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,550\nAs I jump from about 19, and a half gigs,\n\n173\n00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,550\nand I jump to about 25 gigs, so I added\nabout 5 gigs of storage right there.\n\n174\n00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,030\nAs of October first,\nI'm sitting at about 26 gigs total.\n\n175\n00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,330\nThat's total my entire company.\n\n176\n00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,410\nAny one user has 30 gigs\nof storage themselves,\n\n177\n00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,500\nthis is the whole company\nsitting at 26 gigs.\n\n178\n00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,300\nAnd I can start to look down here, and\nsee information based on the users and,\n\n179\n00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,000\nkind of customize that,\nand look at it here.\n\n180\n00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,130\nYou can also see email volume.\n\n181\n00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,100\nSo like on October first,\nI received 165 emails, but\n\n182\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,070\nDenise, she only got 59 emails.\n\n183\n00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,670\nSo, you can look and start to see the\nemail volume that your users are handling.\n\n184\n00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,182\nThat's October 1st,\nI can jump over to October 2nd, and\n\n185\n00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,090\nit should look mostly the same.\n\n186\n00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,623\nOn October 2nd, I got 108 emails.\n\n187\n00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:39,200\nIt was a slower day.\n\n188\n00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,350\nAnd then Denise got 46.\n\n189\n00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,600\nSo, we can start to see exactly,\nhow much traffic these users got.\n\n190\n00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,807\nSo, good information.\nOne thing to note about these reports, and\n\n191\n00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:50,111\nI'll talk about these in\nanother segment later.\n\n192\n00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,060\nBut just one thing to note.\n\n193\n00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,510\nWhen you see a cool report like this,\n\n194\n00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,930\nthere's always more information on\nthe backend that you don't see.\n\n195\n00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,800\nSo, just because there's this.\n\n196\n00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,320\nI don't get a break down like per user,\nso I showed you guys when\n\n197\n00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,500\nI went to Total Storage, that our company\nis sitting in about 26 gigs in storage.\n\n198\n00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,700\nWho's using that?\n\n199\n00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,100\nI don't know, it doesn't show me that.\n\n200\n00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,990\nBut it doesn't mean the data isn't there.\n\n201\n00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,080\nIt is, we just don't see it.\n\n202\n00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,709\nYou can use this Download button up here,\nand you can Export this as a CSV,\n\n203\n00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,210\nor into Google Sheets.\n\n204\n00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,276\nAnd when you get the raw data,\nyou'll see all the extra stuff,\n\n205\n00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,676\nlike how big that actual mailbox is.\n\n206\n00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:33,550\nOr how big that drive storage is,\nper user.\n\n207\n00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,830\nThe data is there.\n\n208\n00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,520\nIt's just not rendered in this graph.\n\n209\n00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,290\nThere's only so much,\nthey can show here in the graph.\n\n210\n00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,980\nAnd that's the real power of the reporting\nsystem, is that the data is all there.\n\n211\n00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,510\nYou can do whatever you want with it,\n\n212\n00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,220\nonce you get it loaded into your\nspreadsheet program, and have at it.\n\n213\n00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,609\nSo, a lot of power to be found there.\n\n214\n00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,060\nWe've just got 12 people, so\nit's easy for me to browse, and pick.\n\n215\n00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,340\nBut in a larger organization, you might\nneed to go over here, and filter by\n\n216\n00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,210\nusername to find the people you're looking\nfor, and generate more filtered results.\n\n217\n00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,993\nSo, if I just wanted to\npull up information on me,\n\n218\n00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:11,766\nI can filter that down, and\nI can see my information down here,\n\n219\n00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:15,685\nand start to look at it\nfrom that perspective.\n\n220\n00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:19,380\nBut again, this is still total\ncompany storage up here, and\n\n221\n00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,150\nso its kind of broken down a little weird.\n\n222\n00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,405\nBut you go into the spreadsheet data's\nthere, you pull out whatever you need.\n\n223\n00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:27,640\nNow, let's see, am I missing anything?\n\n224\n00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,030\nI think that's basically it.\n\n225\n00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,980\nDon't forget that Highlight screen\nbecause that is really handy.\n\n226\n00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,110\nJust to get that simple\ninformation right there,\n\n227\n00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,640\nabout users nearing their storage limit.\n\n228\n00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,350\nReal handy to just quickly pull that data.\n\n229\n00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,960\nSo in this segment, we got a chance to\nlook at the default Sharing settings, and\n\n230\n00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,620\nthe overall Google Drive settings for\nour Google Apps account.\n\n231\n00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,470\nAnd we got a chance to look\nat some of the reporting,\n\n232\n00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,990\nto see how our storage is being used.\n\n233\n00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,550\nHope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n234\n00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,952\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more of Google Apps coming up.\n\n235\n00:11:54,952 --> 00:12:02,304\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,735\n[SOUND] Objective 3.4 focuses\n\n2\n00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:13,375\non using reporting inside of Google Apps.\n\n3\n00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:17,676\nThe full title is demonstrate how to\nuse reports to determine service's use,\n\n4\n00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,630\ntroubleshoot system issues and\nto improve domain security.\n\n5\n00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,450\nWe've got a lot of reporting built into\nour Google App service, and for a lot of\n\n6\n00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,070\nus as an administrator, it is our insight\ninto how our service is being used.\n\n7\n00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,590\nMany companies will deploy Google Apps and\nassume that their employees are using\n\n8\n00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,850\nevery aspect of it, and then you find that\ncertain pieces are just not being used.\n\n9\n00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,700\nWell, there's also some other neat things\nwe can do with reporting just to find out.\n\n10\n00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,110\nFor trouble shooting purposes.\n\n11\n00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,230\nWhether certain things are working\nthe way that we anticipate them to.\n\n12\n00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,830\nSo, let's take a look at\nsome of the reporting.\n\n13\n00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,180\nNow some of this we've already seen.\n\n14\n00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,190\nFirst off, I'm gonna have to\nbounce between two organizations.\n\n15\n00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,990\nMy demo account here that I'm using for\nthe shows is basically empty.\n\n16\n00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,610\nSo it doesn't really have any exciting\nreporting information to give.\n\n17\n00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,420\nSo I'm gonna bounce between\na production environment and my demo.\n\n18\n00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,430\nBut to get to the reporting piece\nthere's a few different ways.\n\n19\n00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,300\nRight here in your admin console,\n\n20\n00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,085\nyou more that likely have a view\nreports link on the right side.\n\n21\n00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,070\nSometimes this panel is hidden so\nyou might not see it,\n\n22\n00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,530\nin which case you might not have that but\notherwise you'll see view reports there.\n\n23\n00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,910\nIf you don't have that link,\nyou can just go down to more controls and\n\n24\n00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,820\nyou'll find reports right there,\nall right.\n\n25\n00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,430\nAnd you can use the little plus symbol\nto pin that up here into your admin\n\n26\n00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,820\nconsole if you want.\n\n27\n00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,280\nBut they both go to the same place.\n\n28\n00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,460\nThey take you to this screen, right here.\n\n29\n00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,180\nIf you have a brand new Google Apps\naccount, or this one isn't brand new,\n\n30\n00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,320\nits been around a few days,\nbut it hasn't seen much usage.\n\n31\n00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,020\nI'm the only one who has\never logged into it.\n\n32\n00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,270\nSo you'll see a message like this,\nthat says, looks like your account is so\n\n33\n00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,960\nbrand new that we don't have any\ndata on usage to show you yet.\n\n34\n00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,292\nYou can expect that on a new deployment.\n\n35\n00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,193\nBut once your deployment has\nbeen around a little while,\n\n36\n00:01:58,193 --> 00:01:59,690\nthat window will look different.\n\n37\n00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,990\nIt'll look like this.\n\n38\n00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,800\nAnd what you're gonna see\nis app usage activity, and\n\n39\n00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,070\nit's breaking down exactly how\npeople are using your system.\n\n40\n00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,160\nAnd you'll see Gmail,\nGoogle Drive Calendar and Google+.\n\n41\n00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,940\nAnd it's showing on a daily\nbasis how this was used,\n\n42\n00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,260\nand breaking it kinda down based on\nwhatever it is that we're specifying.\n\n43\n00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,780\nSo as we look across here,\non each of these days,\n\n44\n00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,310\nI can see on most days I've\ngot ten Gmail accounts set up.\n\n45\n00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,500\nI've got seven people using Google Drive,\n\n46\n00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,240\nsix people using Calendar and\nfour people using Google+.\n\n47\n00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,330\nThese are how many of my employees or the\naccounts that I have that are using it.\n\n48\n00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,630\nNow I can see on the right side on\nuser status I have a total of 12.\n\n49\n00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,120\nI have 12 people that I'm paying for\nevery month to be able to use Google apps.\n\n50\n00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,090\nAnd of those 12,\n10 of them are actually using it.\n\n51\n00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,690\nI can see ten people have logged\ninto g-mail, or drive, or whatever.\n\n52\n00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,690\nSo that means I've got two\npeople that I'm paying for,\n\n53\n00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,110\nthat aren't logging into this system and\nusing it.\n\n54\n00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,450\nAnd so I need to go and evaluate whether\nI should keep those two accounts or not.\n\n55\n00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,980\nI might be paying for\npeople that I don't necessarily need.\n\n56\n00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,270\nOr there might be a reason for that.\n\n57\n00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,840\nThey might be contractors, or I might be\nforwarding their email to somewhere else\n\n58\n00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,760\nso they don't have to actually log\ninto their Google Apps account.\n\n59\n00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,860\nSo there can be extenuating circumstances,\nalways keep that in mind.\n\n60\n00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,960\nEverybody has a different usage scenario.\n\n61\n00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,490\nAnd this report right here is really just\nbased on how people are accessing and\n\n62\n00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,880\nlogging into the system.\n\n63\n00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,600\nYou can change these reports to\nshow all sorts of other things.\n\n64\n00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,500\nYou'll see over here\nthe apps usage activity.\n\n65\n00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,010\nAnd in here's where it'll break down\n\n66\n00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,500\nhow many files we've got that\nare loaded into Google Drive and Docs.\n\n67\n00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,000\nSo I can see how I've got\na really big jump right there,\n\n68\n00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,230\nsometime around August 17th or so.\n\n69\n00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,120\nWhere it looks like somebody must\nhave imported their documents.\n\n70\n00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,600\nSo I've got almost 1,000 new documents.\n\n71\n00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,810\nActually, just a handful shy of 1,000 new\n\n72\n00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,600\ndocuments right there\nin a single day period.\n\n73\n00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,190\nSo somebody uploaded a bunch of\ndata into their Google Drive.\n\n74\n00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,320\nAnd that's fine.\n\n75\n00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,810\nBecause if it's within the capacity of\nthe drive, right, that's why we have it.\n\n76\n00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,630\nSo I can start to monitor that and\nsee yeah, we're really using this.\n\n77\n00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,390\nWe got a lot of documents going in here.\n\n78\n00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,410\nAnd each day it's growing, and so\nthat means that we're putting new stuff\n\n79\n00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,730\nin there each day, and\nI can see some of these are Google Sheets.\n\n80\n00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,170\nSome of these are Google Docs and\nthose numbers are increasing.\n\n81\n00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,110\nActually that's some big\nincreases right there, so\n\n82\n00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,180\nI know that people are using\nthe system the way that we want.\n\n83\n00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,220\nAnd we can kind of break it down here\nseeing how many files people own and\n\n84\n00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,110\nhow many emails they received\nin a particular period.\n\n85\n00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,240\nI'm looking at October 5,\n\n86\n00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,930\n2014 and I can see on October\n5th I received 59 emails, right.\n\n87\n00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,260\nBut I have busier days and slower days.\n\n88\n00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,740\nAnd so you can see some days,\nlike this one.\n\n89\n00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,355\nIt says that I received\n1,583 emails on August 8th,\n\n90\n00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:53,000\nwhich is awesome and I sent 29.\n\n91\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800\nOr i'm sorry these are the totals,\nthis is not me.\n\n92\n00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,083\nSo my company,\nI thought that number was a little high.\n\n93\n00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,095\nMy company received 1,583 emails,\nbut we only sent 29 or\n\n94\n00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:04,660\nat least we sent 29\nthrough Google's servers.\n\n95\n00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,380\nSo you can start to get\nan idea of the capacities.\n\n96\n00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,740\nHow much data is coming and\n\n97\n00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,670\ngoing through your organization and\nstart to measure that.\n\n98\n00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,480\nReally good information\nto be broken down there.\n\n99\n00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,100\nSome of the other things we can view are\nthings like account activity and so on.\n\n100\n00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,620\nLet's take a look at that back\nhere in my demo environment.\n\n101\n00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,510\nAccount activity is a nice one.\n\n102\n00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,170\nBecause, well,\nI guess you can't really see it there.\n\n103\n00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,900\nLet me go back to production here.\n\n104\n00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,290\nIf we go into account activity, you can\nstart to see things like people's access,\n\n105\n00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,360\ntheir user account status,\nwhether they're admins, and\n\n106\n00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,770\nyou can see how many people you have.\n\n107\n00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,370\nYou'll see here, back in May,\nI had 14 accounts.\n\n108\n00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,510\nAnd then we removed 2 of them so\nnow I have 12 accounts.\n\n109\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,220\nSo here's how many\nlicenses I'm paying for.\n\n110\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,610\nThis is my active users\nthat I'm paying money for.\n\n111\n00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,160\nI can see my suspended users and\n\n112\n00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,150\nmy blocked users also, and I can switch\nthese around to show different things like\n\n113\n00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,700\nwho's got two step there for enrollment\nverification turned on, and all of that.\n\n114\n00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,560\nSome of the other things that we can\nverify are a little more security related.\n\n115\n00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,180\nSo see how I've got my\nsecurity report here, and\n\n116\n00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,880\nI don't have a whole ton to show on this\none, but if we go down into our audit,\n\n117\n00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,820\nwe can see some really good things here,\nlike our login status.\n\n118\n00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,090\nI wanna see who's been logging in today.\n\n119\n00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,000\nSo here in my little demo environment,\n\n120\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,670\nI can see where I've been logging in,\nDon Pezet.\n\n121\n00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,960\nAnd I can see where Dave Mustaine\nis logged in and other users.\n\n122\n00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,230\nWell, as soon as it refreshes.\n\n123\n00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,417\nLet me get back to my reports.\n\n124\n00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,530\nAnd we'll see each of the users and\ntheir login activity.\n\n125\n00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,220\nThat's another way to gauge whether or\nnot people are actually using the system.\n\n126\n00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,250\nIf I don't see that user logging in.\n\n127\n00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,080\nThen I know there's a problem.\n\n128\n00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,260\nAnd I might want to gauge\nthis by a single user.\n\n129\n00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,530\nSo if I want to know just what\nDave Mustaine has been doing,\n\n130\n00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,280\nright, I can go over here and I can pick\na username and I can punch that in, and so\n\n131\n00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,180\nI'll pick Dave Mustaine.\n\n132\n00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,710\nAnd now it's gonna filter it\ndown to just his activity.\n\n133\n00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,240\nSo is he actually using the system?\n\n134\n00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,610\nWell I can see he logged in.\n\n135\n00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,680\nHe logged in from this IP address,\nwhich is our studio, right.\n\n136\n00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,280\nSo apparently he was right here\nin the studio and logged in, but\n\n137\n00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,230\nhe's not logging in from home, or probably\nnot logging in from his cell phone.\n\n138\n00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,160\nYou can also choose other events,\nnot just login success,\n\n139\n00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,530\nbut login failure, logout,\nsuspicious logins.\n\n140\n00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,850\nThat's always a nice one,\nsuspicious logins.\n\n141\n00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,880\nBecause you can evaluate whether there's\nnew IP addresses that are showing up,\n\n142\n00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,220\nusually it's IP's from other countries,\nthat always makes them suspicious.\n\n143\n00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,250\nAnd you can get an idea if somebody is\ntrying to pull an attack on your systems.\n\n144\n00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,860\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we can look at.\n\n145\n00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,520\nThe admit audit, right,\nthis is a nice one.\n\n146\n00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,260\nYou can see who's made\nchanges to your account.\n\n147\n00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,000\nSo any time somebody did\na new service update,\n\n148\n00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,580\nI did one in the last segment,\nyou can see any change they made.\n\n149\n00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,000\nYou can see who did it,\nwhen they did it, and what they did.\n\n150\n00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,300\nSo I made some Chrome OS User Setting\nChanges in the previous segment.\n\n151\n00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,560\nThat's logged right here,\nand I can see it, right.\n\n152\n00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,550\nAlso an email log search.\n\n153\n00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,160\nYou can see that I performed\nan email log search this morning.\n\n154\n00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,450\nLooking for my own emails.\n\n155\n00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,130\nWell, what's an email log search?\n\n156\n00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,540\nWell, email log searches are not really\nfor security, they're for troubleshooting.\n\n157\n00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,176\nIf you have a user that says, hey,\nI was supposed to get an email from so and\n\n158\n00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,180\nso and I never got it.\n\n159\n00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,450\nWhat's going on?\n\n160\n00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,980\nWell, we can go in and\ndo an email log search.\n\n161\n00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,740\nIt's a great way to see whether the email\never even made it to Google Apps.\n\n162\n00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,720\nSo if they're saying, hey Don at ITProTV,\nhe sent me an email and I never got it.\n\n163\n00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,410\nWell, I can go in here and\nI can say, you know what?\n\n164\n00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,913\nLet me pull up email from\nthe last seven days, and\n\n165\n00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:41,792\nshow me any email where the sender\nwas don@itpro.tv, all right.\n\n166\n00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,910\nI wanna see if Don emailed\nanybody in my organization.\n\n167\n00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,410\nAnd I can hit search, and it's gonna\nlook to see if we can find any emails.\n\n168\n00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,250\nNow the searches can take a little while,\nso we have to be patient.\n\n169\n00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,950\nThe more email you have and\nthe bigger window of time you choose,\n\n170\n00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,640\nthe longer it's going to take.\n\n171\n00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,840\nSo we do have to be a little bit patient.\n\n172\n00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,260\nBut it's gonna search and find the email.\n\n173\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,660\nNow, I was searching by a sender, who sent\nthe email and I didn't find any emails.\n\n174\n00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,510\nSo this user is saying, hey I was sent\nan email by don@itpro.tv, I didn't get it.\n\n175\n00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,340\nWell, it never even\nmade it to Google Apps.\n\n176\n00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,610\nSo if there was a problem,\n\n177\n00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,880\nit must have happened prior to\neven getting to our account.\n\n178\n00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,819\nSo it could've been blocked by some kind\nof spam filtering system, it could've been\n\n179\n00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,100\nblocked at the senders side, right,\nit may have just not got in there,\n\n180\n00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,458\nwell I could switch and say all right,\nwell let me look at the recipient.\n\n181\n00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:36,080\nLet me look at all the email\nthat my user has received.\n\n182\n00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,042\nSo I'll punch in what am I,\nDpezet@itprotv.net, all right.\n\n183\n00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:45,670\nSo I'm gonna punch in that recipient\nthis time and I'll search based on that.\n\n184\n00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,240\nAnd I'll say show me all\nthe email that this user got.\n\n185\n00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,265\nAnd then we can look and see and\nmaybe they were expecting email from\n\n186\n00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,550\ndon@itpro.tv that actually\ncame from a different address.\n\n187\n00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,490\nSo here we'll be able to spot that.\n\n188\n00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,558\nI can see they've received\nsome different emails and\n\n189\n00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,420\nas I look down the list,\nIf I look at these sender,\n\n190\n00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,875\nhere we go, they got an email from\nDon@edutainmentlive.com, all right.\n\n191\n00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,938\nSo it didn't come from\ndon@itpro.tv like they thought,\n\n192\n00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:14,536\nit came from Don@edutainmentlive.com, and\nI can see it right there it was delivered,\n\n193\n00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,667\nthey got a copy of it right the status\nover here shows as delivered and received.\n\n194\n00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,492\nSo it made it to the mailbox it\nmight have been delivered and\n\n195\n00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:25,182\nthen blocked by our spam filter, it\nwould show up here as being blocked, but\n\n196\n00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:27,333\nin this case it was delivered and\nreceived.\n\n197\n00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,700\nIt actually made it into their mailbox.\n\n198\n00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,020\nI can see it happened.\n\n199\n00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,690\nHere's the subject line,\nso I can see that.\n\n200\n00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,300\nI can see the date and time.\n\n201\n00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,200\nIf you click on the subject line,\nyou'll get some more detailed information.\n\n202\n00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,910\nBut cannot see the message body.\n\n203\n00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,690\nThis is not a way to read\nother people's email.\n\n204\n00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,820\nYou use it for troubleshooting to\nfind out whether the email made it to\n\n205\n00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,520\nthe person or not.\n\n206\n00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,540\nAnd if it didn't, you can find out why.\n\n207\n00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,510\nBut in this case,\nI can just look at it and see.\n\n208\n00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,960\nOne of the really useful things\nis we can expand this out and\n\n209\n00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,860\nsee where the email came from.\n\n210\n00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,150\nI can see the IP address of\nthe server that sent the email.\n\n211\n00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,990\nIf these are being blocked by a spam\nfilter, I might wanna create a white\n\n212\n00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,870\nlist entry for this, and\nI'll need the IP address to that server.\n\n213\n00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,470\nSo I can see it right there and\n\n214\n00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,990\nthat's the IP address I might\nwanna put a white list on.\n\n215\n00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,265\nOr I might just wanna white\nlist this email address,\n\n216\n00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,980\ndon@edutainmentlive.com, right.\n\n217\n00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,887\nThat's information we'll need and\n\n218\n00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,417\nwe can find it right here\nin our email log search.\n\n219\n00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:23,990\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,330\nSo a lot of really cool stuff, if you need\nto be able to read other people's mail,\n\n221\n00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,460\nif you need to be able to read the message\nbodies, you can't do it with this tool.\n\n222\n00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,180\nAll right, instead you can use the vault\nservice, which is an add on for\n\n223\n00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,160\nGoogle Apps.\n\n224\n00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,190\nIf you go under the more Google Services,\nyou can add it in there.\n\n225\n00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,050\nAnd that'll allow you to do eDiscovery,\nand\n\n226\n00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,190\nyou will be able to search by message body\nand contents to find emails that way.\n\n227\n00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,420\nBut with the email log search,\nit's really just based on a few things.\n\n228\n00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,160\nNotice my search criteria.\n\n229\n00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,380\nSend and recipient email address.\n\n230\n00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,570\nSend and recipient IP address.\n\n231\n00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,480\nOr message ID.\n\n232\n00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,310\nAnd the message ID,\nthat's a long letter and\n\n233\n00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,290\nnumber string that identifies\nthat message specifically.\n\n234\n00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,290\nWe're not normally gonna\nsearch by message ID unless we\n\n235\n00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,390\nhappen to have a copy of\nthe email that didn't make it.\n\n236\n00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,610\nAnd if we have a copy of\nthe email that didn't make it,\n\n237\n00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,630\nit probably did make it, right.\n\n238\n00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,682\nWe got a copy some task.\n\n239\n00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:18,330\n[LAUGH] So\nthat one's not the most terribly useful.\n\n240\n00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,620\nBut those are the things we can\nsearch by to find those email.\n\n241\n00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,190\nAll right.\nSo that's a highlight of the reporting\n\n242\n00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,880\nfeatures and how we can use them.\n\n243\n00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,990\nA lot of them are just useful for\nmonitoring usage.\n\n244\n00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,530\nWhether people are actually\nusing our service.\n\n245\n00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,230\nSo we got a chance to see that.\n\n246\n00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,190\nWe got a chance to see\nthe security side of things.\n\n247\n00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,950\nMonitoring whether people have been\nlogging into their accounts or not.\n\n248\n00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,160\nAnd then lastly, we've gotta take\na look at the email log search,\n\n249\n00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,530\nwhere we can verify email delivery,\na wonderful troubleshooting utility.\n\n250\n00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,268\nSo those are the different\nuse scenarios for\n\n251\n00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:53,083\nthe reporting system\ninside of Google Apps.\n\n252\n00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,360\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n253\n00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,625\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Google Apps coming up.\n\n254\n00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:03,529\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,804\n[SOUND] Objective 4.1 is\n\n2\n00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:10,036\nhow to configure Google apps\n\n3\n00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:14,836\nto manage email routing.\n\n4\n00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:17,464\nAnd what they are talking\nabout on this one is how to\n\n5\n00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:21,281\ncontrol the flow of e-mail as it enters\ninto your Google apps account and\n\n6\n00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,050\nhow it exits from your\nGoogle apps account.\n\n7\n00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,646\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhat's the route?\n\n8\n00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:28,880\nE-mail comes in, e-mail goes out.\n\n9\n00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,130\nWe're done.\nThere is not really much to mess with.\n\n10\n00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,930\nAnd you'd be right for most organizations.\n\n11\n00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,940\nBut there are times where\nwe want to influence e-mail\n\n12\n00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,310\nas it passes through our organization.\n\n13\n00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,020\nThere's two different ways\nthat we influence e-mail.\n\n14\n00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,000\nOne way is where we change\nwhere it's going to.\n\n15\n00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,950\nYou may have e-mail that's\ncoming into your account,\n\n16\n00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,370\ninto your Google apps organization.\n\n17\n00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,530\nAnd it's destined for someone who's not\nactually in your Google apps organization,\n\n18\n00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,560\nmaybe they have an email\naccount somewhere else.\n\n19\n00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,400\nAnd so you want to receive that email for\n\n20\n00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,760\nthem and\nforward it along to the destination.\n\n21\n00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,800\nWell, you could do that if you had\na Google apps account for that person,\n\n22\n00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880\nthey could set up\nan email forwarder there.\n\n23\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,620\nBut when you do that you've\ngotta pay a license right.\n\n24\n00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,870\nThat's an active account in Google Apps.\n\n25\n00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,930\nAnd if this persons not using Google Apps,\nit doesn't make sense to pay for\n\n26\n00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,370\nan account just to have\na forwarder in place.\n\n27\n00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,830\nSo instead, we can use mail routing.\n\n28\n00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,760\nWe can say email Dustin for this address.\n\n29\n00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,370\nForward it along to this other\nexternal address or this other person.\n\n30\n00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,460\nSo that's a great way to manipulate\nan email that's coming in.\n\n31\n00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,650\nOn the way out.\n\n32\n00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,050\nIf you have an email that's leaving\nGoogle apps, you're sending an email,\n\n33\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,230\nif it's destined for some business partner\nthat you know has a secure SMTP server,\n\n34\n00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,450\nyou could tell it, hey, when you send\nit out, send it to this server and\n\n35\n00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,120\nmake sure you use SSL or TLS, right.\n\n36\n00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,650\nYou can enforce security on a connection.\n\n37\n00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,930\nSo that's another way that we can\ninfluence incoming and outgoing email.\n\n38\n00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,500\nSo that's the first idea behind mail\nrouting, is just changing the flow,\n\n39\n00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,540\nchanging the direction of that email.\n\n40\n00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,620\nThe second idea behind mail routing\nis actually changing the email.\n\n41\n00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,960\nAs email passes through our\nGoogle Apps account we can modify it.\n\n42\n00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,210\nAnd there's a number of different\nthings that you can do.\n\n43\n00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,290\nA great example, and\n\n44\n00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,240\nyou guys have probably seen this, Is you\nmight get an email every now and then.\n\n45\n00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,170\nIt's obvious that somebody wrote it.\n\n46\n00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,090\nIt's all written out in plain English,\nor whatever language you speak natively.\n\n47\n00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,770\nIt's written by a person, but then at\nthe very bottom is a legal disclaimer.\n\n48\n00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,260\nAnd you can tell this is not something\nthey just wrote, that attorneys wrote it\n\n49\n00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,610\nand it says this email is destined for\nthe recipient only and blah, blah, blah.\n\n50\n00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,320\nUnauthorized use prohibited and so on.\n\n51\n00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,890\nWell, how did that legal disclaimer\nget on the bottom of that email?\n\n52\n00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,950\nThey could've written it,\nright, they probably didn't,\n\n53\n00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,340\nthey could've copied and pasted or\nmade it a part of their signature.\n\n54\n00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,130\nBut, with Google Apps mail routing, we can\nactually insert that programmatically, so\n\n55\n00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,560\nthat every email leaving our organization.\n\n56\n00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,380\nGets this custom footer stuck on it.\n\n57\n00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,440\nWe're modifying the email.\n\n58\n00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,527\nOr we could manipulate email addresses,\n\n59\n00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,270\nwe can add additional\npeople as recipients to it.\n\n60\n00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,840\nSo maybe you want to store a copy\nof every email sent from our\n\n61\n00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,620\norganization, you can do that.\n\n62\n00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,490\nSo these are ways that we can modify\nan email in transit through the system and\n\n63\n00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,200\nwe use the mail routing system to do it.\n\n64\n00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,780\nNow modifying mail routing\nis really not that hard.\n\n65\n00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,231\nIt's challenging if you just try and\nstumble through it,\n\n66\n00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,430\nif you say I'm just going\nto figure this out.\n\n67\n00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,350\nThe mail routing settings actually\nshow up in more than one place and so\n\n68\n00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,040\nit gets really confusing to\nfigure out where to set it.\n\n69\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,150\nBut if you know what you're doing,\nthe system is actually really simple.\n\n70\n00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,520\nIt's just,\nwe have more than one way to get there.\n\n71\n00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,200\nAll right.\n\n72\n00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000\nThe first thing we need to do is we\nneed to get into our Gmail preferences.\n\n73\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,130\nSo I'm here on my admin console,\nand I'm going to go to Google apps.\n\n74\n00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,830\nAnd from the app screen,\nI'm going to go down here into Gmail.\n\n75\n00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,160\nNow, we're going to see all\nthe different Gmail settings in here,\n\n76\n00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,870\nas we start to see our\ndifferent categories.\n\n77\n00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,500\nAnd you'll see default routing,\nand you'll see hosts.\n\n78\n00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,690\nThese are the two pieces that\nare involved with routing.\n\n79\n00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,520\nAnd you might be tempted to go there,\nbut I'm actually going to\n\n80\n00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,690\nshow you a different place we can go\nthat's a little bit easier for us.\n\n81\n00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,810\nWhen we define mail routing,\nthere's two pieces.\n\n82\n00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,380\nIf we're just modifying emails that\nare passing through our system\n\n83\n00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,090\nThen we just go into default routing and\nwe start to\n\n84\n00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,220\nchange the default routing email to\nadd the modifications that we want.\n\n85\n00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,510\nBut if we're changing the flow for emails,\n\n86\n00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,760\nif we're changing where emails are going\nto based on the server they came from, or\n\n87\n00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,710\nthe server they're going to We\nneed to define hosts first.\n\n88\n00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,080\nThe host is going to be that external\nserver whose emails we're manipulating.\n\n89\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,590\nSo, those are the two pieces\nwe need to specify, and\n\n90\n00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,490\nyou can do it from right here.\n\n91\n00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,320\nBut it's a little bit easier if we go up\nto the top and we got to User Settings.\n\n92\n00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,120\nI know that it doesn't sound right, like\nwell to User settings, but if you go to\n\n93\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,310\nUser settings it actually takes you\ninto the advanced settings for Gmail.\n\n94\n00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,940\nSee my little bread crumb trail up here\nsays Google Apps, Settings for Gmail.\n\n95\n00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,030\nAdvanced settings.\n\n96\n00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,040\nIt doesn't say user settings, right?\n\n97\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,610\nSo, it's kind of weird that it does that.\n\n98\n00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,610\nThere's actually another way to get here.\n\n99\n00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,380\nBack on my settings for Gmail screen,\nif I scroll all the way down,\n\n100\n00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,450\nthere's this little tiny link right\nhere that says advanced settings.\n\n101\n00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,170\nIt'll take you to the same place.\n\n102\n00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,790\nThey all go to the same place.\n\n103\n00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,677\nSo that's what I normally do,\nis kind of browse in that way,\n\n104\n00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:19,030\nis just go to user settings.\n\n105\n00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,840\nAnd here, inside of user settings, if we\nscroll down, we'll see all sorts of stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,140\nAnd here's the end user settings.\n\n107\n00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,040\nThat's why that link took us here.\n\n108\n00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,100\nBecause the end user\nsettings are right there.\n\n109\n00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,930\nBut if you keep scrolling down,\nyou'll find where end user access is.\n\n110\n00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:42,060\nSpam settings, compliance settings,\nand there it is, routing.\n\n111\n00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,380\nSo the routing settings\nare right in here also.\n\n112\n00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,330\nWhichever way we go to get here, if you go\nto advanced settings, if you go to user\n\n113\n00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,970\nsettings whatever, you end up on this\nscreen and you can get down to routing.\n\n114\n00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,470\nAnd when we set things up here\nit's a little bit easier for\n\n115\n00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,560\nus because it gives us a chance to define\nthe routing and the host at the same time.\n\n116\n00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520\nThose two separate pieces,\nI can do them at the same time,\n\n117\n00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840\nand it does make life a little bit easier.\n\n118\n00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,320\nYou'll also notice,\nif I scroll all the way back to the top,\n\n119\n00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,330\nActually we don't see it on this screen,\nshoot.\n\n120\n00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,330\nOn some screens we'll actually see tabs\nacross the top and you'll see hosts and\n\n121\n00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,190\nrouting up there too.\n\n122\n00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,310\nWe'll see that a little bit later.\n\n123\n00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,120\nAgain it's the same screens, the same\nsettings Just different ways to get to it.\n\n124\n00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,610\nThis one doesn't have those tabs.\n\n125\n00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,730\nIf I look under routing,\nI've got my email routing, and\n\n126\n00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,000\nnotice how it says locally applied.\n\n127\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,570\nRemember, just like policies\nin our Google Apps account,\n\n128\n00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,840\nwhen we set up email routing,\nit's done on a per organization basis.\n\n129\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,020\nRight now,\nI'm on my IT Pro TV organization.\n\n130\n00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,140\nAnd these settings are locally applied\nright here on that organization.\n\n131\n00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,120\nAny change I make is going to trickle\ndown to affect my contractors and\n\n132\n00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,290\nretired people also.\n\n133\n00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,960\nBut, if I go down to contractors,\nmaybe I want to have a different\n\n134\n00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,770\nlegal disclaimer at the bottom of\ne-mails from the legal contractors, so\n\n135\n00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,980\nI could choose that And\nwhen I go in here to their routing.\n\n136\n00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,630\nWhen I go down to their routing section.\n\n137\n00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,420\nSee how it says, not configured yet?\n\n138\n00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,270\nI can configure that using my configure\nbutton over here on the side.\n\n139\n00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,060\nAnd we can go and start to modify those\nsettings just for this sub-organization.\n\n140\n00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,910\nSo you can have different email routing\npolicies for different tiers or\n\n141\n00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,250\ndifferent organizations in your company,\nvery, very flexible stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,400\nLet me get back to my\nrouting section here.\n\n143\n00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,800\nNow inside of the routing there's\na handful of things that we can do,\n\n144\n00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,420\nthe first setting here is\nkind of an important one.\n\n145\n00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,890\nIt's a catch all address.\n\n146\n00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,250\nWhen somebody sends a email to an email\nthat's attached to your domain.\n\n147\n00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,660\nSo my domain here is IT Pro TV dot net.\n\n148\n00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,040\nIf you send an email to\nD Pezet at IT Pro TV dot net,\n\n149\n00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,810\nthat's my test account, and I'll get it.\n\n150\n00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,680\nI've got a valid account.\n\n151\n00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,882\nBut, what if you send it to\nDon at IT Pro TV dot net?\n\n152\n00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:58,877\nWell, I don't have that address,\nso it's gonna fail.\n\n153\n00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,318\nThe server is actually gonna reject.\n\n154\n00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:03,079\nThe message, it won't accept the message\nfor an address that doesn't exist.\n\n155\n00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,680\nThe sending server will\nget a rejection host.\n\n156\n00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,950\nBut what if you want those emails?\n\n157\n00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,870\nWhat if you want to support\nsomebody sending an email to\n\n158\n00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,380\nan address that doesn't exist?\n\n159\n00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,220\nYou can create a catch all address.\n\n160\n00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,840\nA catch all address, so\nI could create one, and\n\n161\n00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,300\nmaybe I'll make it dpezet@itprotv.net\nwhich probably a phenomenally bad idea,\n\n162\n00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,970\nbut let's say we do it.\n\n163\n00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,650\nNow if anybody sends an email to\nan address that doesn't exist,\n\n164\n00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,530\nthe email will get delivered to me.\n\n165\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,140\nI'll get a copy of it, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,230\nNow that might sound like a great idea.\n\n167\n00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,140\nHey that's wonderful!\n\n168\n00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,840\nNow if somebody has a typo in their\nemail or whatever I'll get a copy of it,\n\n169\n00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,620\nI can receive it.\n\n170\n00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,300\nWonderful.\n\n171\n00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,150\nAll right?\n\n172\n00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,070\nBut the problem is Internet spam.\n\n173\n00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,460\nInternet spam agents, right?\n\n174\n00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,910\nWhen they start relaying spam,\n\n175\n00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,740\na lot of times they're just\ntrying brute force names.\n\n176\n00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,340\nAnd so they'll do things like\nbob@itprotv.net or tom@itprotv.net.\n\n177\n00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,910\nJust randomly picking names,\nhoping to hit a person.\n\n178\n00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,040\nWell, all of those random\nnames are gonna go to me.\n\n179\n00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,850\nI'm gonna get that.\n\n180\n00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,300\nSo when you set up a catch all mailbox\nyou can expect its spam numbers\n\n181\n00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,610\nto just explode astronomically.\n\n182\n00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,360\nIt'll get a ton of stuff.\n\n183\n00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,630\nThe other thing is your server is\nno longer rejecting the messages.\n\n184\n00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,150\nIt's gonna accept them.\n\n185\n00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,315\nSo if somebody outside is trying to\nsend an email to me, Don Pezet, or\n\n186\n00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:24,620\ndpezet@itprotv.net, one of the ones I get\nall the time is where they'll type dperez.\n\n187\n00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,040\nFor some reason, my last name, Pezet,\nin people minds they switch it to Perez,\n\n188\n00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,230\nit just happens.\n\n189\n00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,330\nSo if they send to that,\nit's a bad address, right?\n\n190\n00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,040\nNormally they'd get a bounce message\nsaying, hey that's not a valid address,\n\n191\n00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,980\nand they'd look at it and go, oh that's\nright that's not how you spell his name or\n\n192\n00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,450\noh look I made a typo, and they'd fix it.\n\n193\n00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,030\nBut with a catch all,\nthe message delivers.\n\n194\n00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,840\nThey think that it successfully went.\n\n195\n00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,480\nNow unless I'm checking\nthis catch all mail box,\n\n196\n00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160\nI'm probably not gonna notice that.\n\n197\n00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,000\nAnd so these might go unlooked at.\n\n198\n00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,240\nWhoever the sender was\nthinks they were delivered.\n\n199\n00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,320\nWhoever the recipient was\nnever actually got it.\n\n200\n00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,040\nAnd so the catch all is not something\nthat most organizations want, so\n\n201\n00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,530\nyou may want to discard,\nwhich is the default.\n\n202\n00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,420\nDiscard says if an email comes in for\n\n203\n00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,710\nan address that doesn't exist,\nwe just toss it, throw it out.\n\n204\n00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,532\nAll right.\n\n205\n00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:15,895\nThen we can specify things\nlike an outbound gateway.\n\n206\n00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:16,720\nAll right.\n\n207\n00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880\nNow an outbound gateway is\nkind of a neat feature.\n\n208\n00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,321\nWhen you send your email, the default\nis they send from Google's servers.\n\n209\n00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,260\nAll right?\n\n210\n00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,820\nBut you might be paying for\nsome kind of email archiving service.\n\n211\n00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,650\nSo you wanna keep a record all emails\nsent from or to your organization.\n\n212\n00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,000\nNow, Google has the Google vault service,\nso you could use that.\n\n213\n00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,740\nBut, maybe you gotta use a third party\nsolution because you're company's already\n\n214\n00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,390\npaid for it or\n\n215\n00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,940\nyou have some legal compliance issue\nthat makes you use a third party.\n\n216\n00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,140\nYou can specify an outbound gateway.\n\n217\n00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,200\nAnd all email sent from\nyour Google Apps accounts,\n\n218\n00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,440\ninstead of just going straight out to\nthe Internet through Google servers,\n\n219\n00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,660\nwill instead be sent to\nwhoever you put in right here.\n\n220\n00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,640\nSo we can specify the SMTP server, and now\nall of our outgoing email will flow there.\n\n221\n00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,940\nGreat way to do additional spam filtering.\n\n222\n00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,990\nOr to do, you know, e-discovery,\ncollecting the data and storing it.\n\n223\n00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,250\nWe can also do other things like\nrecipient address mappings.\n\n224\n00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,010\nYou might have one recipient who you\nwant to get emails for other addresses.\n\n225\n00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,670\nSo for\nexample I've got dpezet@itprotv.net right?\n\n226\n00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,810\nI might want to have\nmore than one address.\n\n227\n00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,420\nWell, I saw a way we could\ndo aliases on an account.\n\n228\n00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,870\nI think we covered that\nin another segment.\n\n229\n00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,350\nSo you could edit the user.\n\n230\n00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,222\nAnd go into their profile and\nadd in aliases, up to 20 of them.\n\n231\n00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:37,810\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,840\nWhat if you need more than 20,\n\n233\n00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,340\nor what if you want the alias to actually\nbe something that we can easily move from\n\n234\n00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,130\naccount to account without\nmodifying individual user accounts?\n\n235\n00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,520\nWell, we can come in here and\ndo a recipient address map.\n\n236\n00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,970\nThe cool thing about recipient\naddress maps is they\n\n237\n00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,640\naren't tied specifically to the user.\n\n238\n00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,270\nThey're set here in the admin panel so\nwe have a little more control over them.\n\n239\n00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,660\nAnd when you go into the configuration\nscreen, you can punch in a short\n\n240\n00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,280\ndescription of the mapping, and then\nwhat it is you're doing the mapping for.\n\n241\n00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,320\nAll incoming messages or only incoming\nmessages from outside people.\n\n242\n00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,300\nIn other words, not.\n\n243\n00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,180\nEmails between our company members.\n\n244\n00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,570\nSo I'll say these will\nbe like Don's aliases.\n\n245\n00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,990\nAnd I'll say, all incoming messages,\nfor the above type of messages,\n\n246\n00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,530\nrewrite the following recipients.\n\n247\n00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,190\nAnd I'm just gonna add in who\nit is that I want to rewrite.\n\n248\n00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,370\nSo it says, enter address mappings below\nwith each mapping on a single line.\n\n249\n00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,770\nTwo addresses separated by a comma.\n\n250\n00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:43,660\nSo I want don@ITProTV.net to be\nmapped to dpezet@ITProTv.net.\n\n251\n00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,160\nSo, I'll just punch that in and hit add.\n\n252\n00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,300\nAnd it's got this address being\nmapped to this other address.\n\n253\n00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,860\nAnd so I can start to punch in other ones.\n\n254\n00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,630\nMaybe I'll get some generic\nemails like info@ITProTV.net.\n\n255\n00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,800\nIf I can type it.\n\n256\n00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,090\nThen I wanna map it to dpezet right?\n\n257\n00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,980\nSo we can start to punch in these other\nemails and those are gonna get mapped in.\n\n258\n00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,300\nNow when somebody sends\nan email to don@ITPROTV.net,\n\n259\n00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,460\nI'll still get a copy of it, right?\n\n260\n00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,520\nBut, if we do it as an alias,\nwhen it makes it into our inbox,\n\n261\n00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,680\nwe'll see that it was actually\nsent to don@itprotv.net.\n\n262\n00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,280\nWhen we do an address map like this, when\nwe get it, it will actually show us having\n\n263\n00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,320\nbeen sent to depezet@@itprotv.net.,\nso it kind of masks that address.\n\n264\n00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,120\nBut we can go through and enter in\nthe various aliases that we want and\n\n265\n00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120\nthen we can add that setting.\n\n266\n00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,690\nNow, because the address\nis being rewritten,\n\n267\n00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,940\nhow do we know that it was\nsent to a different address?\n\n268\n00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,150\nWell, you do have the option to add\nan original tube to the header.\n\n269\n00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,320\nAn extra header entry so\nthat we can see that.\n\n270\n00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,240\nThe default is it overwrites it and\nit disappears, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,070\nBut if we want we can choose that and\nit'll add that to the email header.\n\n272\n00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,690\nI'll add that setting and\nnow I've got two address mappings.\n\n273\n00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,305\nAnd I can go and continue to add more\nmappings that are adjusting the emails as\n\n274\n00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,071\nthey pass through my organization.\n\n275\n00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,470\nAll right.\n\n276\n00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,216\nSo the first couple of examples there\nare ways that we can manipulate the emails\n\n277\n00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:08,183\nthemselves.\n\n278\n00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:10,350\nRight?\nThe outbound gateway,\n\n279\n00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,115\nthat was changing the outbound\nrouting of all of our email.\n\n280\n00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:17,885\nBut what if I want to change the outbound\nrouting of just some emails?\n\n281\n00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:19,445\nWell this is all of them, right.\n\n282\n00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:23,865\nSo I need to be specific if I want to\nhit individual servers or domains.\n\n283\n00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,045\nAnd you'll see that options is next.\n\n284\n00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,345\nWe've got Receiving routing,\nand Sending routing.\n\n285\n00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:33,465\nSo, how do I route incoming emails\nfrom the outside world to me, and\n\n286\n00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,440\nhow do I route outgoing emails\nfrom me to the outside world?\n\n287\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,000\nAll right?\n\n288\n00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,540\nNow, if I want to just change\nall of my outgoing email,\n\n289\n00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,900\nthat's where this Outbound\ngateway comes in.\n\n290\n00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,730\nBut if I want to change\ncertain outbound emails or\n\n291\n00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,000\nif I want to be specific,\nthat's where the send routing comes in.\n\n292\n00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,140\nNow, receiving routing and sending routing\nare actually configured the same way.\n\n293\n00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,630\nThe configuration screens are identical.\n\n294\n00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,170\nIt's just the direction of\nthe email that's different.\n\n295\n00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,700\nSo let's say for example,\non the receiving side,\n\n296\n00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,930\nif I'm going to be receiving email for\na user, and I just want to turn around and\n\n297\n00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,325\nforward it to somewhere else,\nforward it to some external address.\n\n298\n00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,195\nI can go into receiving routing,\nand I can configure that.\n\n299\n00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,845\nSo, I'll hit my configure\nbutton on the side.\n\n300\n00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:17,495\nAnd it's gonna take me to\nthe receiving routing screen, right?\n\n301\n00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:19,585\nWe can give it a description.\n\n302\n00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:28,470\nAnd I can call this incoming email for\nBob Smith.\n\n303\n00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,190\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,690\nAnd I can specify the emails to effect.\n\n305\n00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,420\nInbound, that means email\nsent from the outside world,\n\n306\n00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,020\nto Bob Smith inside my company.\n\n307\n00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,280\nInternal, that means email sent from\nsomeone in my company to Bob Smith,\n\n308\n00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,650\nin my company also.\n\n309\n00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,350\nTechnically email between two\nemployees just go direct and\n\n310\n00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,690\nthe routing doesn't apply to them.\n\n311\n00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,639\nSo I'm specifying whether I want to effect\njust inside or just outside or both.\n\n312\n00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,354\nI want to effect every email\nthat's sent to Bob Smith.\n\n313\n00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:04,721\nAnd then I can start to\npick what I want to do.\n\n314\n00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:10,130\nIf somebody's emailing Bob Smith,\nwhat do I do?\n\n315\n00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,012\nAnd now,\nI can specify how I wanna handle that.\n\n316\n00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:18,050\nI wanna take it and I wanna forward\nthis out to his external account.\n\n317\n00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,550\nI'm not actually gonna have an account for\nBob Smith, I'm gonna forward this to\n\n318\n00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,705\nan external account, so I can change\nthe route or change the recipient.\n\n319\n00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,540\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna change the recipient.\n\n320\n00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,220\nAnd I'm gonna replace the recipient\nwith whatever his address happens to be.\n\n321\n00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,160\nSo, maybe it's bob@aol.com.\n\n322\n00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,890\nSo, if you send an email to\nbob@itprotv.net I'm gonna intercept it,\n\n323\n00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,550\nchange the destination to bob@aol.com and\nsend it along.\n\n324\n00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,830\nSo, we can modify that and manipulate it,\nand send it to a different place.\n\n325\n00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,550\nYou'll see where you can\npreserve the domain name or\n\n326\n00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,320\npreserve the username, if you're\njust changing part of the address.\n\n327\n00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,280\nBut I'm replacing the whole thing.\n\n328\n00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,240\nI'll make it Bob.\n\n329\n00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,491\nMy apologies to you if that is\nyour email address [LAUGH].\n\n330\n00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:03,454\nWe won't relate too much to it.\n\n331\n00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,920\nYou'll see also where you\ncan bypass the spam filter.\n\n332\n00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,970\nThat's really useful.\n\n333\n00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,250\nI know we've had a problem at ITProTV\nwhere a lot of our receipts for\n\n334\n00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,070\npeople purchasing subscriptions and\nso on, will get flagged as spam.\n\n335\n00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,950\nAnd so, you can choose to bypass the spam\nfilter for those types of emails.\n\n336\n00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,700\nYou can also strip attachments if you\nwanna get those off of the emails.\n\n337\n00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,660\nAnd you can add more recipients.\n\n338\n00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,110\nNow, why would you do that?\n\n339\n00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,300\nWell, adding more recipients is a neat\nway to do, I call it poor man's vault.\n\n340\n00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,422\nIf you want an email vault, like one\nemail account that has all of the emails\n\n341\n00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:44,330\nfrom your entire organization,\nyou could add it as a recipient.\n\n342\n00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,510\nYou could punch that in\nas something like a BCC,\n\n343\n00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,580\nso that every time that somebody sent\nan email out, or received an email in,\n\n344\n00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,750\nthat a copy of it was\nsent to this one mailbox.\n\n345\n00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,880\nAnd then you have this one\nmailbox you could log into and\n\n346\n00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,800\nsearch to find your data.\n\n347\n00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,664\nThe Google vault service is a little bit\nbetter cuz it gives you better reporting,\n\n348\n00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,568\nbut this is an easy way to go about it,\nand\n\n349\n00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:05,158\nyou have one mailbox that\nhas all of that information.\n\n350\n00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,878\nBut there might be other reasons.\n\n351\n00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,480\nYou might wanna copy in somebody's\nmanager when they receive emails, or\n\n352\n00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,130\ncertain types of emails\nwe add recipients to.\n\n353\n00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,630\nEither way.\n\n354\n00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,850\nThen, I can specify when\nI want this to apply.\n\n355\n00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,570\nNow, I don't want this to\napply to everybody's email,\n\n356\n00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,240\nwhich is what's gonna happen right now.\n\n357\n00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,140\nI wanna get just email\nsent to bob@itprotv.net.\n\n358\n00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,610\nSo, down here, I can specify a sender\naddress, or a recipient address.\n\n359\n00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,200\nThe recipient address is\nthe one I wanna manipulate.\n\n360\n00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000\nI'm gonna put in here\nan address that I wanna match.\n\n361\n00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,899\nAnd so, I'm gonna say,\nif somebody's emailing bob@itprotv.net.\n\n362\n00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,288\nIf they're emailing bob@itprotv.net,\nI wanna catch that and\n\n363\n00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:49,880\nchange it to this other address.\n\n364\n00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,950\nNow, it does use a regular\nexpression to do that search, and\n\n365\n00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,895\nyou've got to be careful\nwith regular expressions,\n\n366\n00:18:55,895 --> 00:19:00,400\ncuz some characters like that dot\ncan be interpreted different ways.\n\n367\n00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,080\nSo, there is a little learn more\nlink you can click on here that\n\n368\n00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080\ntalks about regular expressions and\ntheir formats.\n\n369\n00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,710\nAnd how you need to phrase\nthings to be able to identify\n\n370\n00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,970\nparticular parts of a string, and so on.\n\n371\n00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,430\nSo, you can check a lot of that stuff.\n\n372\n00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,970\nAnd they've even got a little test\nexpression link here where you can test it\n\n373\n00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,650\nto see if it matches.\n\n374\n00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,000\nSo, if I'm punching in that address,\n\n375\n00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,400\nI can make sure that my regular\nexpression matches and that it shows it.\n\n376\n00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,665\nSo, for example,\nif Bob had more than one email account,\n\n377\n00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:37,061\nif he had Bob1, Bob2 and Bob3@itprotv.net,\nI could come in here and\n\n378\n00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:41,345\nsay, Bob, and then in square brackets,\none dash three.\n\n379\n00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:45,950\nAnd then, when I do an email address,\nif it's Bob 1, see how I have a match?\n\n380\n00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,950\nAnd if I change it to Bob 2,\nI still have a match.\n\n381\n00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,240\nIf I change it to Bob 3,\nI still have a match.\n\n382\n00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,570\nIf I change it to bob 4,\nI no longer have a match.\n\n383\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,690\nSo, these regular expressions\ngive you a lot of flexibility for\n\n384\n00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,610\ncatching more than one address.\n\n385\n00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,279\nI'm gonna leave it at just\nhis straight up address.\n\n386\n00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,780\nAnd that should be all I need.\n\n387\n00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,580\nAnd I'll go and add that routing.\n\n388\n00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,180\nSo, now, I'm gonna uncheck this,\n\n389\n00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,550\nexecute the setting only if\nthe envelope sender matches.\n\n390\n00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,110\nI don't care who the sender is so\nI'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n391\n00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,590\nI just care about the recipient.\n\n392\n00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,505\nIf I get an email where\nthe recipient is bob@itprotv.net,\n\n393\n00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,500\nthen I'm gonna take this action.\n\n394\n00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,070\nI'm gonna change\nthe recipient to bob@aol.com.\n\n395\n00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,810\nSo, that should be every\nthing that we need.\n\n396\n00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,300\nI'll go ahead and add the setting.\n\n397\n00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,810\nAnd now, I've got a receive route put in.\n\n398\n00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,860\nNow, that receive route is entered\nright here, I can add more.\n\n399\n00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,160\nI can go in and start to add other ones,\nputting in additional settings.\n\n400\n00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,810\nAnd in this scenario, I was just\ntaking it and over riding it for\n\n401\n00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,610\na particular email address.\n\n402\n00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,160\nI might wanna overwrite things for\nan entire domain and\n\n403\n00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,590\nyou can certainly do that based on\nwhatever your criteria happen to be.\n\n404\n00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,820\nWe normally see that with things\nlike sender routing or sending.\n\n405\n00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,660\nWhen we're sending email out,\n\n406\n00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,926\nif I have a business partner\nthat I do work with a lot,\n\n407\n00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:10,210\nI might wanna send email for their domains\nstraight to a particular email server.\n\n408\n00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,670\nThey might have an email server that's\nset up to allow me to relay for them.\n\n409\n00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,360\nYou see this a lot with bulk\nemail services like Mailgun or\n\n410\n00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,980\nSendGrid or whatever.\n\n411\n00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,740\nSo, you might have send routing for your\nmarketing email to go out through them,\n\n412\n00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,070\ninstead of going straight\nout to the internet.\n\n413\n00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,105\nSo, we can go to send routing and\nstart to manipulate that.\n\n414\n00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:34,060\nWhen we go to configure it here,\nI'll call this my marketing email reroute.\n\n415\n00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,360\nAnd I'm gonna be rerouting\nout bound emails.\n\n416\n00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,400\nI don't care about internal emails,\nthis is just outbound.\n\n417\n00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,332\nSo, it's going out to the internet and\nI'm gonna change my sender,\n\n418\n00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:52,910\nI want that to be marketing@itprotv.net.\n\n419\n00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,430\nSo, any email being generated\nby marketing@itprotv.net, so\n\n420\n00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,580\nany outbound email from that address,\nI wanna change where it goes.\n\n421\n00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,590\nAnd up here, I'll do change route and\nI'm gonna reroute it.\n\n422\n00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,200\nNow, the default is normal routing,\nbut if you drop that down,\n\n423\n00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,290\nyou'll see where you\ncan pick other routes.\n\n424\n00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,890\nI don't have any.\n\n425\n00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,183\nI don't have any other route to pick from,\nso I need to add that route in and that's\n\n426\n00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:21,166\nwhere we go back to what I mentioned\nearlier that we have the routing rules and\n\n427\n00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,370\nwe have the hosts that we need to\ndefine to go in and set those.\n\n428\n00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,890\nWe'll get a chance to see\nthat in just a second,\n\n429\n00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,890\nI'll have to come back and edit this rule.\n\n430\n00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,340\nI'm gonna go and add the setting for\nnow with normal routing.\n\n431\n00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,870\nAnd then, I can come back and\nmodify it in a moment.\n\n432\n00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,400\nOne word of advice for the exam is\nyou start to modify this stuff.\n\n433\n00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,220\nThis page right here, the Gmail page,\n\n434\n00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,200\nthere's something weird about it and\nif you start making a bunch of changes,\n\n435\n00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,610\nthe odds of your changes failing\nincrease with each change you make.\n\n436\n00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,610\nSo, it's a good idea that\nevery time you make a change,\n\n437\n00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,400\nyou immediately hit save changes.\n\n438\n00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240\nSo, I just made two changes at once,\nand I haven't hit save, so\n\n439\n00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,130\nthe odds of this failing\nis starting to go up.\n\n440\n00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,850\nSo, I need to make sure that I hit save,\nand\n\n441\n00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,150\nif you get an error here, well,\ndon't be surprised, first off [LAUGH], and\n\n442\n00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,130\nthen secondly, you'll need to go\nback in and redo your changes.\n\n443\n00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,370\nRemember, on the exam,\n\n444\n00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,440\nthey're grading you by checking\nthe end result, not how you did it.\n\n445\n00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,040\nSo, if you don't save the change,\nyou don't get the end result.\n\n446\n00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,520\nYou get the question wrong.\n\n447\n00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,040\nSo, make sure you save after each and\nevery change.\n\n448\n00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,210\nAnd not just on the exam,\nbut even in real life land.\n\n449\n00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,580\nYou wanna make sure you save\nafter each and every change.\n\n450\n00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,900\nThere are just a lot of settings on\nthis page and so it's difficult for\n\n451\n00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,620\nthe system to track that and\nit does get a little bit quirky.\n\n452\n00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,110\nBut I saved my changes, I can see\nmy reroutes are all right there, so\n\n453\n00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,750\nI've got those if I have my vault settings\nor whatever I could turn that on.\n\n454\n00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:48,610\nSo, you'll see some additional options\nin here that are able to be manipulated,\n\n455\n00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,030\nand you can change those.\n\n456\n00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,648\nBut I just created an entry and\n\n457\n00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:56,199\nI couldn't change my routing because I\ndidn't have an additional route in there.\n\n458\n00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,800\nSo, I need to go and\nget that squared away.\n\n459\n00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,747\nIf I go back to my settings for Gmail,\nRight in here I'll see the hosts and\n\n460\n00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:06,800\ndefault routing that I mentioned\nway back in the beginning.\n\n461\n00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,550\nWell, let's take a look at that.\n\n462\n00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,210\nIf I'm dealing with somebody,\nlet's say SendGrid.\n\n463\n00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,860\nSo, I'm using SendGrid as an outgoing\nemail service for my marketing email.\n\n464\n00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,650\nThey help make sure that you\ndon't violate any spam rules, and\n\n465\n00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,080\nthey do all sorts of bounce tracking and\nstuff like that.\n\n466\n00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,890\nI could send my emails\nright from Google apps,\n\n467\n00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,930\nbut I don't get a lot of bounce\ninformation and all the reporting and\n\n468\n00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,880\nadvanced analysis you get through\nan actual marketing service.\n\n469\n00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,660\nSo I can go into hosts, and I can\ndefine the SendGrid servers right here.\n\n470\n00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,410\nI'm just gonna go up here to add route.\n\n471\n00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,640\nAnd I can specify, so\nthese would be the SendGrid Servers.\n\n472\n00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,410\nAnd I can specify a single host or\nmultiple hosts, and\n\n473\n00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,540\nI'm pretty sure they used multiple ones,\nright, so we'd punch in whatever.\n\n474\n00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:58,510\nI'm making these addresses up, so don't\nassume that I've got it actually correct.\n\n475\n00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,400\nBut we can punch in that information for\nconnecting to their servers.\n\n476\n00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,430\nAnd if there's more than one server,\nhow we want the load to be distributed.\n\n477\n00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,650\nSo maybe I go 50/50 on these, and\nyou can add in as may servers as you need.\n\n478\n00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,100\nAll right.\n\n479\n00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,720\nSo, I've got those servers in.\n\n480\n00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,880\nI can choose whether I wanna require TLS.\n\n481\n00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,480\nTLS is Transport Layer Security.\n\n482\n00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,260\nIt basically uses SSL to encrypt\nthe communication between the two\n\n483\n00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,440\nGoogle servers.\n\n484\n00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,610\nI believe I talk about\nthat in another objective.\n\n485\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,140\nSo we'll see that a little bit later.\n\n486\n00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,660\nBut we can choose to\nturn that on right here.\n\n487\n00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,880\nThere is this option Require\na CA signed certificate.\n\n488\n00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,290\nAnd with that one, what we're saying is it\nneeds to be a public, actually registered,\n\n489\n00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,890\nand trusted certification authority\nthat issued the certificate,\n\n490\n00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,060\nnot a self-signed certificate.\n\n491\n00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,540\nIf you uncheck that, they could have\na self-signed certificate where you might\n\n492\n00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,950\nnot trust the route, but\nyou'll still use it for encryption.\n\n493\n00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,310\nThat's weaker security, but\nif you know you trust that cert,\n\n494\n00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,800\nyou can turn that option off.\n\n495\n00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,970\nBut if you don't know, you just leave\nthat checked, and you'll be covered.\n\n496\n00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,840\nOh, shoot, you know what?\n\n497\n00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,980\nI made a mistake here.\n\n498\n00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,290\nI've got my primary and my secondary.\n\n499\n00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,650\nWhat I did is I set these loads at 50%.\n\n500\n00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,000\nIt's gonna use the primary's\nunless they're not available, and\n\n501\n00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,740\nthen it'll use the secondary.\n\n502\n00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,230\nWhat I should have done if had more than\none primary was to hit this Add button.\n\n503\n00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,820\nAnd here you'll see where I\ncan add my multiple ones.\n\n504\n00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,840\nSo it red-flagged me because my\npercentages didn't add up to 100.\n\n505\n00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,780\nAnd that's what I really should've done.\n\n506\n00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,430\nAnd maybe we've got\nmail3.sendgrid as a backup, right?\n\n507\n00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,810\nSo if these guys aren't available,\nthen it'll fail down.\n\n508\n00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,160\nSo I entered that wrong.\n\n509\n00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,450\nAll right.\nSo once we've got that in place,\n\n510\n00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,680\nwe can hit Save.\n\n511\n00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,050\nAnd now I've got my SendGrid\nservers to find as a host.\n\n512\n00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,330\nThen, we can define our route.\n\n513\n00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,690\nNow technically this is a route.\n\n514\n00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,160\nSee how it was the Add route\nbutton here to get that specified.\n\n515\n00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,530\nIf I go back to my settings for\nGmail though, I can go down here to my\n\n516\n00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,230\ndefault routing and this'll show\nthe routes that my emails followed.\n\n517\n00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,270\nNow it looks empty, but what it's\nactually doing is the default is to\n\n518\n00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,580\ngo through Google servers, and you can't\noverride that, so it doesn't even show up.\n\n519\n00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,080\nWe're adding in modifications\nto the default.\n\n520\n00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,480\nSo I can hit Add setting, and\nI can specify some information.\n\n521\n00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,720\nNow notice this screen looks familiar,\nright?\n\n522\n00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,253\nThis is the same as the routing rules\nI was looking at a moment ago in\n\n523\n00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,994\nthe Advanced settings.\n\n524\n00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:21,194\nAnd so, when we look here and\n\n525\n00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:24,320\nsee what we're doing,\nwe're specifying who the recipient is.\n\n526\n00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,760\nAnd then down here,\nwe can hit Change route, and\n\n527\n00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,920\nwe can specify SendGrid Services\nnow on my list.\n\n528\n00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,470\nBut, we probably don't want to do it from\nhere because you'll notice this screen\n\n529\n00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,330\ngives us less options.\n\n530\n00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,441\nNotice down here for the options, I can't\nreally match on a particular address.\n\n531\n00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,410\nSo, this is a little bit more limited.\n\n532\n00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,880\nAnd that's why I said we don't\nnormally like to use this screen, but\n\n533\n00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,810\ninstead if we go back to our settings for\nGmail and\n\n534\n00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,660\nUser settings, and\nwe'll scroll down to that routing section.\n\n535\n00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,150\nWe have a lot more power down\nhere in the routing section, and\n\n536\n00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,580\nthat's why we normally configure it here.\n\n537\n00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,360\nSo, I can go and\nfind that route that I put in.\n\n538\n00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,890\nSo here's my marketing email route.\n\n539\n00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,160\nI'm gonna edit that route.\n\n540\n00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,093\nAnd so here is where I matched, and you'll\nsee the advanced stuff down here where I'm\n\n541\n00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:10,734\nmatching just stuff coming\nfrom marketing@itprotv.net.\n\n542\n00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:15,040\nBut the difference now is I can\ngo to change the route, and\n\n543\n00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,490\nI can pick my SendGrid servers.\n\n544\n00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,741\nSo now, whenever the marketing\nemail address sends an email out to\n\n545\n00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,051\nthe Internet, instead of just going\nstraight out to the Internet,\n\n546\n00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,458\nit'll send it to SendGrid.\n\n547\n00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,990\nAnd SendGrid will take care of sending it\nout to everybody else that's out there.\n\n548\n00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,600\nSo that is an example of\nmanipulating outbound routing.\n\n549\n00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,710\nSo, we've seen quite\na few different things.\n\n550\n00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,250\nLet me just make sure I've just covered\neach of the things I wanted to talk\n\n551\n00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,990\nabout, yeah.\n\n552\n00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,700\nSo, we got a chance to see some of\nthe things we can do with email routing.\n\n553\n00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,970\nIt's really powerful stuff.\n\n554\n00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,590\nFirst, we could modify\nemails that were coming in.\n\n555\n00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,840\nOur incoming emails,\nwe could change where they go to,\n\n556\n00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,340\nwe could redirect them somewhere else.\n\n557\n00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,310\nWe can even rewrite their address,\nrewrite the recipient.\n\n558\n00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,590\nBypass spam filtering, whatever we wanted.\n\n559\n00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,990\nOur outbound routes,\n\n560\n00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,920\nwe can manipulate what servers were\nbeing used to send those emails.\n\n561\n00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400\nAnd we also got to see\nthe outbound gateway setting,\n\n562\n00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,690\nwhere we can just send all of our\noutbound email to a particular host,\n\n563\n00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,440\nwhich is great for\narchival purposes and things like that.\n\n564\n00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,310\nA lot of power to be had here and\n\n565\n00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,970\nchanging the way those emails pass in and\nout of your organization.\n\n566\n00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,200\nNow most companies aren't\ngonna need this stuff, right?\n\n567\n00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,940\nThe Google services are perfectly good for\nus and they'll meet the needs of most\n\n568\n00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,020\norganizations, but I think I've kind of\nlaid out the scenarios for you guys where\n\n569\n00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,960\nthat might not be the case, where you\nmight want to take advantage of this and\n\n570\n00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,940\nit's nice to know that power is there.\n\n571\n00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,930\nSo that pretty much takes\ncare of email routing.\n\n572\n00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,250\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n573\n00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,332\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more Google apps coming up.\n\n574\n00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:45,660\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,958\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,092\nObjective 4.2 covers allowing or\n\n3\n00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,960\nblocking email addresses as\nthey pass through your system.\n\n4\n00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,515\nThe official name is demonstrate how to\nmanage approved or reject sender lists and\n\n5\n00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,450\nwhitelist senders by domain and\nIP address.\n\n6\n00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,560\nAnd really,\nall we're talking about is making a list\n\n7\n00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,290\nto say these people are allowed to come\nin, don't bother scanning them for spam.\n\n8\n00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,430\nOr these people are not\nallowed to come in,\n\n9\n00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,480\ndon't bother scanning them for\nspam either!\n\n10\n00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,583\nJust chuck them, right,\n[LAUGH] just ditch these emails.\n\n11\n00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:41,580\nWhitelists and\nblacklists are explicit lists.\n\n12\n00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,250\nWe specify, regardless of what\nthe content of the message is,\n\n13\n00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,740\nto allow it or block it.\n\n14\n00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,260\nIf there's an email address or\nan IP address of an SMTP server\n\n15\n00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,850\nthat you know is only going\nto send you spam, that you\n\n16\n00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,550\nknow is not gonna send you anything of\nvalue, you can create a blacklist entry.\n\n17\n00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,860\nAnd any email generated by that server or\n\n18\n00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,020\nany email sent from that\naddress will be blocked.\n\n19\n00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,380\nOr if you know for a fact there's a system\nout there that's going to be sending you\n\n20\n00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,860\ngood legitimate email, but\n\n21\n00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,780\nmight occasionally get flagged to spam\naccidentally, you can create a whitelist,\n\n22\n00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,440\na list that says, don't flag that as spam,\nlet it come through.\n\n23\n00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,710\nNow you need to be careful with\nthese whitelists and blacklists.\n\n24\n00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,240\nThe reason is the temptation when you\nmake them is to make them based on\n\n25\n00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,480\nan email address.\n\n26\n00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,520\nSo if I say, I wanna allow any\nITProTV email to come through, so\n\n27\n00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,610\nI'm gonna add in the ITPro.TV domain.\n\n28\n00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,800\nSo any email that comes from somebody\nat ITPro.TV I allow in, right?\n\n29\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,830\nThe problem is email doesn't actually\ndo any kind of sender validation.\n\n30\n00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,110\nSo for the sender address,\nsomebody could spoof it.\n\n31\n00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,480\nThey could say that it's so and so\n\n32\n00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,660\nat ITProTV.net without\nactually being from that host.\n\n33\n00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,110\nAnd if I've put that name in my whitelist,\nit'll bypass all the spam checking and\n\n34\n00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,640\nbe allowed to come in.\n\n35\n00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,940\nGoogle spam checking is second to none.\n\n36\n00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,590\nIt is amazing,\nthey really do a lot of stuff.\n\n37\n00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,260\nOne of the things they do is SPF record\nchecking, where when you get an email and\n\n38\n00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,490\nthey say they're from ITProTV, it'll look\nup their mail server to find out whether\n\n39\n00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,790\nit's actually listed for ITProTV, whether\nthey're actually coming from that domain.\n\n40\n00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,300\nAnd if they aren't, it'll block it.\n\n41\n00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,760\nBut a whitelist bypasses that.\n\n42\n00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,190\nA white list stops that check, and so\n\n43\n00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,060\nsomebody can spoof an email\naddress to start sending spam in.\n\n44\n00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,610\nSo we do need to be careful with this.\n\n45\n00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,052\nYou're better off doing whitelists and\n\n46\n00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,550\nblacklists based on the IP\naddresses of a server.\n\n47\n00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,790\nIt's much more difficult,\nalmost impossible,\n\n48\n00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,810\nto spoof the IP address of a server.\n\n49\n00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,700\nIt's a pretty big challenge to do it.\n\n50\n00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,880\nSo if we were to have a list in there\nbased on IP saying block this server\n\n51\n00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,010\nregardless of what it sends or allow\nthe server, that makes a lot more sense.\n\n52\n00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,680\nSo you've got two different choices\nof how you wanna do it, but\n\n53\n00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,150\nthey work pretty much the same way.\n\n54\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,940\nLet me show you how they work.\n\n55\n00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,820\nFirst off, we're gonna set\nthese in our Gmail settings,\n\n56\n00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,360\nand like any Gmail setting you can set\nthis at your parent organization and\n\n57\n00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,280\nit'll trickle down to all of your suborgs,\nor you can set it differently for\n\n58\n00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,630\ndifferent sub-organizations.\n\n59\n00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,610\nIt's up to you how you wanna go about it.\n\n60\n00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,540\nBut I'm gonna go into Google Apps\nhere in my admin console, and\n\n61\n00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,530\napparently my session has timed out so\nI'm just gonna re-authenticate.\n\n62\n00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,990\nAnd then once I'm in,\nI'll go into my Gmail settings.\n\n63\n00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,720\nAnd here in Gmail we'll see several\ndifferent options, and the one that I\n\n64\n00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,800\nwanna go into is User settings, or\nAdvanced settings down here at the bottom.\n\n65\n00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,290\nEither one's gonna take\nme where I wanna go.\n\n66\n00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,960\nInside of the settings for Gmail,\nwe will find a section called Spam, and\n\n67\n00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,750\nthat's what I'm looking for,\nis that section called Spam.\n\n68\n00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,330\nWe'll just browse down and find it.\n\n69\n00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,720\nThere it is.\n\n70\n00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,050\nSo the Spam section's what controls\nour whitelists and our blacklists.\n\n71\n00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,838\nHere's where we specify.\n\n72\n00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:54,295\nSo a whitelist, those are the good guys,\nthe ones we want to allow through.\n\n73\n00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:58,030\nAnd the blacklist, those are the bad guys,\nthe ones that we wanna block out.\n\n74\n00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,490\nSo it starts out with the whitelist and\nthen it goes on to the blacklist.\n\n75\n00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,430\nOr, they don't specifically\ncall it a blacklist here.\n\n76\n00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,530\nThey call it a Blocked senders list,\n\n77\n00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,410\npeople that we don't want to allow\nto send email through our system.\n\n78\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,220\nNow the whitelist\nactually takes two forms.\n\n79\n00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,000\nThere's the email whitelist itself right,\nhere\n\n80\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,670\nwhere we can list the IP addresses for\nthe email servers that we want to allow.\n\n81\n00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,350\nAny email server that we list here,\nwe won't spam check it.\n\n82\n00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,542\nWe'll allow it to come in and\nwe won't block it.\n\n83\n00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:32,333\nNow let's say that you use\nan external mail service.\n\n84\n00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,078\nI mentioned that Google spam filtering is\nsecond to none, they really have a good\n\n85\n00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:39,780\nsystem, but there are other providers\nthat do it, like Barracuda Networks.\n\n86\n00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,440\nBarracuda has great spam checking also.\n\n87\n00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,660\nThey also do anti-virus a little bit\nbeyond what Google does, and they have\n\n88\n00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,340\nsome great archiving systems over there\nfor doing e-discovery, and so on.\n\n89\n00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,590\nSo your company might\nalready be invested in them.\n\n90\n00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,610\nSo for your MX records for your domain,\nyou might have all of your inbound\n\n91\n00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,955\nemail go to Barracuda, and then\nBarracuda sends the emails over to you.\n\n92\n00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,585\nSo if that's the case,\nanything coming through Barracuda's\n\n93\n00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,705\nalready been spam filtered, so\nwe might not want to filter it.\n\n94\n00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,355\nNow you might be tempted to\nput that right here in the IP\n\n95\n00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:11,715\naddress whitelist, all right?\n\n96\n00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,275\nYou could do that.\n\n97\n00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,875\nBut when it's an SMTP server\nlike that that's gonna\n\n98\n00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,745\nbe sending large volumes of your email,\n\n99\n00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:22,210\nyou're actually better off specifying\nit down here as an Inbound gateway.\n\n100\n00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,500\nInbound gateways are whitelisted, also.\n\n101\n00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,650\nThe difference is when you put\nthem on the whitelist up here,\n\n102\n00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,730\nthey completely bypass\nall of the spam scanning.\n\n103\n00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,000\nBut when you choose the Inbound gateway,\n\n104\n00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,100\nit'll still do some basic checking to make\nsure the emails are actually being sent\n\n105\n00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,820\nfrom the server they're\nsupposed to happen.\n\n106\n00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,570\nSo it's a little bit more\nsecure to go ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,730\nuse this option for\ninbound gateways like that.\n\n108\n00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,862\nBut if you had a simple device,\nsomething like a scanner/copier, and\n\n109\n00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:53,150\nthat scanner/copier,\nyou scan a document, and\n\n110\n00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,338\nthe copier will email it\nright into your organization.\n\n111\n00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:59,980\nYou might wanna list that\ncopier up here to say\n\n112\n00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,480\ndon't bother spam scanning this thing,\nit's a copier, it's allowed to send in.\n\n113\n00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,140\nIt's not sending high volumes of traffic\nthat would make me want to put it as\n\n114\n00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,940\nan inbound gateway, but\nit is just sending this traffic in.\n\n115\n00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,580\nI don't want to scan it.\n\n116\n00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,530\nSo these two options largely\nachieve the same goal, but\n\n117\n00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,850\nif it's an inbound SMTP server that's\ngonna be sending all of your data,\n\n118\n00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,819\nyou'll wanna use the Inbound\ngateway option right here.\n\n119\n00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,500\nAll right, so two options there,\nand we can specify them.\n\n120\n00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,020\nNotice how it's got enter the IP addresses\nfor your email, not email addresses.\n\n121\n00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,375\nSo if I wanna whitelist a particular user,\nlike don@itpro.tv, I can't put that here.\n\n122\n00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,550\nSo does that mean I can't\ndo it by email address?\n\n123\n00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,170\nNo, you can, right?\n\n124\n00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,140\nIt's just easy to exploit.\n\n125\n00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,690\nAnd so\nGoogle doesn't make it available here.\n\n126\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,105\nWe'll see that option down a little bit,\nwe can set it on our blacklist.\n\n127\n00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500\nSo that's the whitelisting functionality\nright there, pretty straightforward.\n\n128\n00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,310\nAs we scroll down, you'll see there's\nanother little option right here.\n\n129\n00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,610\nOnly let users receive emails\nfrom the gateways listed above,\n\n130\n00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,233\nall others will be rejected, right?\n\n131\n00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,950\nWhy would I wanna do that?\n\n132\n00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,560\nWell, if I'm using Barracuda Networks, and\nall of my incoming email is being sent to\n\n133\n00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,930\nthem for archive purposes, and then from\nthere it's being sent into Google Apps,\n\n134\n00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,300\ndo I want to allow people\nto bypass Barracuda?\n\n135\n00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,000\nNo.\n\n136\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,480\nIf I'm doing all my e-discovery there,\n\n137\n00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,440\nit's important that all\nemail goes through there.\n\n138\n00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,570\nSo we can choose to\nreject everything else.\n\n139\n00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,730\nSo, maybe we've got SMTP.barracuda.com.\n\n140\n00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,770\nSo I punch them in as the mail server,\nand then I check this option off to say\n\n141\n00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,980\nif the email doesn't come through them,\nI don't want it, reject it.\n\n142\n00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,850\nAnd that ensures that all incoming\nemail will only be able to pass\n\n143\n00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,810\nthrough that host.\n\n144\n00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,620\nAnd for your MX records in DNS,\nyou would only list the Barracuda guys.\n\n145\n00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,500\nYou would not even list\nGoogle Apps because\n\n146\n00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,042\nthe email's not coming\ndirectly to Google Apps.\n\n147\n00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,478\nI don't wanna turn that option on, cuz I'm\nnot paying for that service, [LAUGH] and\n\n148\n00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:56,917\nI don't want to disable my email.\n\n149\n00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:59,983\nSo I'm gonna discard that change.\n\n150\n00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:04,044\nSo that's the inbound side of things for\nthe white list.\n\n151\n00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,460\nFor the blacklist we have two options\ndown here, we've got a spam entry and\n\n152\n00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,500\na blocked senders entry.\n\n153\n00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,600\nAnd on the spam entry notice what it says,\n\n154\n00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,400\ncreate approved sender list\nthat bypasses the spam folder.\n\n155\n00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,650\nThat sounds like what we had up here.\n\n156\n00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,330\nThese email addresses should\nnot be marked as spam.\n\n157\n00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,880\nBut the difference is, up here it's\njust the IP addresses of servers.\n\n158\n00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,750\nBut if we come down here to Spam,\nwe can configure a list, and\n\n159\n00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,470\nin the list we can specify email\naddresses or entire domains.\n\n160\n00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,580\nSo I'm gonna put in here a spam\nlist to say allow ITProTV emails.\n\n161\n00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,375\nAnd down here, look at my options.\n\n162\n00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,156\nI've got be more aggressive\nwhen filtering bulk emails, so\n\n163\n00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,730\nmaybe I'll want it to be stronger for\nthese addresses.\n\n164\n00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,800\nI can say bypass spam for these email\naddresses, which is what I wanna do.\n\n165\n00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,860\nAnd then you'll say, bypass spam\nfilters received from addresses or\n\n166\n00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,540\ndomains within the approved list.\n\n167\n00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,710\nAnd so,\nI can specify that list right here.\n\n168\n00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,260\nNow I don't have any lists,\nso I don't see anything.\n\n169\n00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,940\nBut it gives me the chance to create one.\n\n170\n00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,660\nSo I'll create one, and in the list,\nI'll call this my ITProTV list.\n\n171\n00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,010\nSo there's my ITProTV list,\nand I can edit that, and\n\n172\n00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,340\nI can start to add in email addresses and\ndomains.\n\n173\n00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,590\nAnd so I'm gonna add in, maybe I\nwanna do don@itpro.tv specifically.\n\n174\n00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,460\nThis person is allowed\nto be able to send in.\n\n175\n00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,150\nOr I wanna do an entire domain,\nlike @itpro.tv, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,470\nSo any email that comes in for ITProTV\n\n177\n00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,330\nwith a sender of somebody@itpro.tv,\nallowed in.\n\n178\n00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,190\nWhen I save that, oh, sorry.\n\n179\n00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,460\nDon't need the at when you do that.\n\n180\n00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,400\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,450\nSo just leave that at symbol off.\n\n182\n00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,170\nSo I've got those entered in there,\nand now those will bypass the list.\n\n183\n00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,070\nJust be aware, somebody could\nspoof that sender address and\n\n184\n00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,678\nthen it kinda defeats this whole purpose.\n\n185\n00:09:58,678 --> 00:09:59,710\nSo you gotta be careful,\n\n186\n00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,150\nbut otherwise, that'll make it\nwhere those can come through.\n\n187\n00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,180\nSo that's my list, and\nthat list will bypass the spam filter.\n\n188\n00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,780\nSo I'll add that setting in and\nnow I've got it,\n\n189\n00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,410\nand I'll go ahead and hit Save Changes.\n\n190\n00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,670\nSo I'm now allowing those emails to\ncome through and bypass the spam filter.\n\n191\n00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,802\nSo even though it says spam here,\nthis really is a whitelist.\n\n192\n00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,540\nThen block senders, that's our blacklist.\n\n193\n00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,600\nThe block senders work to start\nto prohibit various things.\n\n194\n00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920\nAnd so here I can block, and\n\n195\n00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,850\nnotice what it says, block or\napprove specific senders.\n\n196\n00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,420\nEven though this is our blacklist,\n\n197\n00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,460\nyou can actually configure\nthe white list from here too.\n\n198\n00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,430\nIt's kind of neat.\n\n199\n00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,720\nI know a lot of people actually just not\neven bother with this spam setting, and\n\n200\n00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,750\njust go straight down here to do it.\n\n201\n00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,570\nEither way works.\n\n202\n00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,160\nIf you look at the blocked\nsenders settings,\n\n203\n00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,740\nif I configure that,\nwe can give it a name.\n\n204\n00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,830\nSo maybe I know for a fact certain\nemail address are only relaying spam.\n\n205\n00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:03,510\nSo I put in here, this is gonna\nbe my default spam blacklist.\n\n206\n00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,082\nAnd then right here I can put addresses\nthat I want to automatically reject\n\n207\n00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,125\nmessages from.\n\n208\n00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:14,875\nSo I can create a new list, and\nI'll call this my spam list.\n\n209\n00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,043\nOr actually, I'll call it my blacklist so\nI can remember what it is.\n\n210\n00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:23,100\nAnd then I can edit that list, just like\nI did with the ITProTV list earlier.\n\n211\n00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,850\nAnd here I can add in addresses or\ndomains.\n\n212\n00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,555\nSo maybe I know for a fact that Nate\nat itpro.tv is gonna send me spam,\n\n213\n00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:35,660\nor I know that the spam.com domain\nis gonna send me spam, or whatever.\n\n214\n00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,130\nWe can put all sorts of stuff in here,\nand I can save that.\n\n215\n00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,160\nHere's my list of people that\nwould just be outright rejected.\n\n216\n00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,800\nGoogle won't even look at the message\nbody, won't even scan it,\n\n217\n00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,590\nit'll just see that sender and say, nope,\nyou're on the blacklist, and throw it out.\n\n218\n00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,830\nSo real easy to reject those messages.\n\n219\n00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,650\nNow you can put in a default\nrejection notice right here.\n\n220\n00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,020\nIt's optional, so if you don't,\nthere is a message display but\n\n221\n00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,350\nyou can punch in one here.\n\n222\n00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:10,730\nYou have been rejected due to being\nlisted on our email blacklist.\n\n223\n00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,700\nIf this is a mistake, please email.\n\n224\n00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,375\nWe probably shouldn't email,\nwe should probably say please\n\n225\n00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,550\ncall 1-900-MIX-ALOT to be removed.\n\n226\n00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,390\nSo we can specify what they can do,\n\n227\n00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,030\nwhat action they can take to\nget back on the right system.\n\n228\n00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,850\nAnd then down here at the bottom\nwe can specify any other options.\n\n229\n00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,300\nAnd notice, bypass this setting for\nmessages received from addresses or\n\n230\n00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,340\ndomains within these\napproved sender lists.\n\n231\n00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,715\nSo I can actually start to do whitelisting\nhere inside of the blacklist.\n\n232\n00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,015\nAnd that's kind of odd, but you can do it.\n\n233\n00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:52,075\nAnd this is useful cuz\nmaybe there is one address\n\n234\n00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:56,225\nat spam.com that I do want to allow,\nand so I can put that in there.\n\n235\n00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,985\nOr maybe I just wanna manage my whole\nwihtelist, and so I can do it from here.\n\n236\n00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:04,086\nSo I could choose Use Existing, and you'll\nsee my ITProTV list is right there, so\n\n237\n00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:04,807\nI can pick it.\n\n238\n00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:09,230\nIt's the same as going\nthrough the other spam route.\n\n239\n00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,400\nAnd so I can hit Add that setting and\nnow I've got my blacklist configured.\n\n240\n00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,910\nSo for the whitelist and the blacklist,\na few different ways to configure,\n\n241\n00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,745\na few different settings here,\nbut those are each of them.\n\n242\n00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,455\nSo we started out by taking\na look at the email whitelist,\n\n243\n00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,805\nwhich was based on the IP\naddress of servers.\n\n244\n00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,895\nThen we talked about the Inbound gateway,\nwhich is used when we have\n\n245\n00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:33,037\nexternal email services that we're trying\nto route all of our email through.\n\n246\n00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:37,192\nWe saw the Spam list,\nwhich is really our whitelist,\n\n247\n00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,362\nwhere we bypass the spam filter for\ncertain addresses.\n\n248\n00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,522\nAnd lastly, we saw the Blocked senders,\nwhich is our blacklist,\n\n249\n00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:48,262\nwhere we explicitly block certain\npeople from sending email in, and\n\n250\n00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,992\nwe can create exceptions to it as needed,\nall right?\n\n251\n00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:55,442\nSo that in a nutshell is our blacklist and\nwhitelist management, or\n\n252\n00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,944\nour sender filtering.\n\n253\n00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:00,663\nSo that's about it.\n\n254\n00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,070\nSometimes I feel like I forget things.\n\n255\n00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,920\nBut I've got all my notes, so that's it.\n\n256\n00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,950\nSo, all right.\n\n257\n00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,270\nI hope you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n258\n00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,875\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Google Apps coming up next.\n\n259\n00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:17,279\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:13,527\nhandling email inside of Google Apps.\n\n4\n00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:18,686\nThe official title is, Demonstrate How\nto Apply Security Best Practices to\n\n5\n00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:24,510\nEmail Including Transmit Mail Via\na Secure Connection Based On System Rules.\n\n6\n00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,400\nAnd what they're talking about is how\nemail is inherently non-secure, right?\n\n7\n00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,420\nThe entire email infrastructure\nis built around SMTP,\n\n8\n00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,530\nthe simple mail transport protocol, and\nSMTP sends everything in plain text.\n\n9\n00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,690\nThat's what it does.\n\n10\n00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,810\nSMTP was developed in a more innocent\ntime, the early days of the internet,\n\n11\n00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,190\nwhere people were nice and\nfriendly and behaved themselves.\n\n12\n00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,710\nIt didn't have security built into it.\n\n13\n00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,740\nReally it was just the Wild West.\n\n14\n00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,200\nNow we have to take precautions to try and\nsecure things.\n\n15\n00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,440\nIn the email world,\n\n16\n00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,550\nthere's really three legs of\nthe journey that have to be secured.\n\n17\n00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,588\nThere's the journey from your client\nmachine to Google's servers, right?\n\n18\n00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:06,780\nSo that would be like me firing up\na web browser and going to Gmail,\n\n19\n00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,940\nlogging in, and writing my email, right?\n\n20\n00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,600\nSo that's client to Google.\n\n21\n00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,730\nThen, you've got the email\npassing from Google servers\n\n22\n00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,110\nto the destination server, right?\n\n23\n00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,600\nSo when it passes across the internet, by\ndefault that's plain text, and so we need\n\n24\n00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,820\nto secure that connection between Google\nand whoever we're sending our email to.\n\n25\n00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,940\nAnd then the third leg of that journey\nis from that destination email server\n\n26\n00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,730\nto the recipient.\n\n27\n00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,390\nSo the person who's receiving\nthe email and reading it, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,700\nWe can actually control security on two\nout of those three legs, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,950\nWe can control security between our\nclients and the Google servers and\n\n30\n00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,820\nwe can control security between the Google\nserver and the destination SMTP server.\n\n31\n00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,430\nBut we can't control security from the\ndestination email server to their client.\n\n32\n00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,590\nIt's up to them to configure that.\n\n33\n00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,550\nSo there's no real way with email to\nprovide end-to-end connection-based\n\n34\n00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,500\nsecurity.\n\n35\n00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500\nIf you want that,\n\n36\n00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,620\nyou've got to use technologies like S/MIME\nwhich are all client-based technologies,\n\n37\n00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,750\na little outside of the scope\nof what Google Apps does.\n\n38\n00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,120\nBut on the server side, there's some\nthings we can do to help secure emails\n\n39\n00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,240\nto at least ensure that the emails we're\nsending internally are secure, all right?\n\n40\n00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,380\nStep one, let's take a look\nat the email client, right?\n\n41\n00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,480\nOur end users are going to Gmail and\nlogging in and\n\n42\n00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,300\naccessing their account, all right?\n\n43\n00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,770\nWell, for\n\n44\n00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,090\nthe most part, Google has switched to\nan SSL everywhere type configuration.\n\n45\n00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,940\nSo for most people, when they go to Gmail,\nit's automatically going to be SSL.\n\n46\n00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,750\nBut it's not actually enforced.\n\n47\n00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,724\nThey could override it and do a non-secure\nconnection if they really wanted to.\n\n48\n00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:47,037\nSo we can configure that right\nhere in our admin console.\n\n49\n00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:51,902\nIf you go into your admin console and\ngo to More Controls and Security,\n\n50\n00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:57,360\ninside of Security you've got basic\nsettings and you'll see right here.\n\n51\n00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,550\nSSL.\n\n52\n00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,670\nAutomatically enforce SSL connections\nwhen users sign into any Google Apps.\n\n53\n00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,985\nNot just Gmail, but the add-in console,\nit uses SSL anyway.\n\n54\n00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:12,525\nBut even the other services,\nlike Blogger and YouTube, and so\n\n55\n00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,245\non, it's gonna make sure\nthat we use SSL there, too.\n\n56\n00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:19,295\nSo we're protecting our clients Wwen\nthey connect up to a Google App service,\n\n57\n00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,815\nthey'll use SSL.\n\n58\n00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,555\nSo I'm gonna check that off\nto ensure that's happening.\n\n59\n00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,525\nNow, it's probably already happening for\nyour users,\n\n60\n00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,880\ncuz it's kind of the default for\na lot of apps.\n\n61\n00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,630\nBut to prevent it from being overridden,\nwe can turn it on here and\n\n62\n00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,200\nthat'll make sure that it's enforced,\nall right?\n\n63\n00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,080\nYou can even see where I was using HTTPS\nup here already, even though I hadn't\n\n64\n00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,740\nchecked that option, and that's because\nGoogle defaults to being secure.\n\n65\n00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,110\nSo, that's the client side or\nend users connected to Gmail.\n\n66\n00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,740\nWhat about server-to-server?\n\n67\n00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,470\nSo the Gmail servers connecting\nto the third party email servers.\n\n68\n00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,100\nWell, SMTP doesn't have\nsecurity built into it so\n\n69\n00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,365\nthere's not much we can do there,\nbut they have created\n\n70\n00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:03,100\nadd-ons to SMTP that allow us\nto encrypt those communications,\n\n71\n00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,240\nand the most common of them is called TLS,\nor Transport Layer Security.\n\n72\n00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,000\nWhat TLS does is it uses SSL, the same\nsecurity method that we're using to\n\n73\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,220\nconnect to the web pages, it uses SSL\nwith your email connection, with SMTP.\n\n74\n00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,840\nSo, if your server that you're reaching\nout to, the destination server,\n\n75\n00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,060\nif they have an SSL certificate\nattached to their SMTP service,\n\n76\n00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,630\nwe can use that to encrypt communications.\n\n77\n00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,840\nMost email providers have that these days,\nbut some don't, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,450\nThere's some email systems where they\njust don't care about security, or\n\n79\n00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,270\naren't worried about it or\nwhatever, and for\n\n80\n00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,360\nwhatever reason they don't\nhave the certificate.\n\n81\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,025\nSo what we can do is we can go into our\nsystem and we can say, you know what?\n\n82\n00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,250\nWe require that.\n\n83\n00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,342\nWe require email communications\nbetween Google and\n\n84\n00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:49,680\nthat destination server to have a cell,\nto use TLS.\n\n85\n00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,940\nAnd if they don't, we won't send.\n\n86\n00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,020\nOr, you can do it on\na per domain basis and\n\n87\n00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,650\nyou can say emails going to this domain,\ngoing to this server, we'll use TLS.\n\n88\n00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,580\nThe other ones, use it if you can,\ndon't use it if they don't have it, right?\n\n89\n00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,670\nAnd that's kind of the default in Google.\n\n90\n00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,010\nIn the Google servers, they'll use\nthe certificates if they're there.\n\n91\n00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,230\nSo if it can use TLS, it'll do it.\n\n92\n00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,240\nBut if TLS fails, the default is to go\nahead and send it unencrypted, right?\n\n93\n00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720\nSo that's what it's going to do.\n\n94\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840\nWe can override that behavior.\n\n95\n00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,762\nTo override that behavior, we need\nto go back into our Gmail settings.\n\n96\n00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:23,978\nI'm in the general security settings here,\nI need to go into Gmail.\n\n97\n00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:28,076\nSo, I'm gonna go to my admin console and\nGoogle Apps, and\n\n98\n00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:33,782\nthen in here I'll go into Gmail, and\nI'm gonna go down to my Advanced Settings.\n\n99\n00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:40,160\nAnd in my Advanced Settings, I'm looking\nfor a section called Compliance.\n\n100\n00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,190\nNow if you've watched some of our other\nshows, you might have seen the segment\n\n101\n00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,130\nwhere I talk about email routing, and\nwe can configure it in email routing, too.\n\n102\n00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,650\nBut if you want this to be general,\nto affect all the servers,\n\n103\n00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,010\nyou're just looking for\nthe Compliance section.\n\n104\n00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,690\nAnd down here I'll find Compliance,\nand inside of Compliance you'll find\n\n105\n00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,160\na section about TLS,\nSecure Transport Compliance, all right?\n\n106\n00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,940\nAnd we can configure this and\nsee what it's described as.\n\n107\n00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,050\nRequire TLS when communicating\nwith the specific domains.\n\n108\n00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,900\nSo we can go into Configure, and\n\n109\n00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,870\nwe can add in servers that we want to\nconfigure to communicate with securely.\n\n110\n00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,360\nIf you did this under the routing,\nthis is actually the same screen,\n\n111\n00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,640\nexcept it's filtered out some of the\noptions that all I have is the TLS side.\n\n112\n00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,060\nSo we can enforce this for\ninbound or outbound or both.\n\n113\n00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,022\nSo I could say all of my emails and\n\n114\n00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:33,020\nthen I could specify the servers\nthat I want to correspond with that.\n\n115\n00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,990\nSo, this is ITProTV.net.\n\n116\n00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,870\nWe've also got ITPro.tv,\nand so maybe I wanna say,\n\n117\n00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,890\nanytime I communicate to ITPro.tv,\nwe need to use TLS, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,120\nAnd, so I can come in and\n\n119\n00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,160\nspecify that, and so\nI'm gonna put in here this is ITProTV.\n\n120\n00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,080\nAny inbound and outbound messages\nthat are going to that domain.\n\n121\n00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,320\nSo I'll need do a list.\n\n122\n00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,135\nSo I'll hit, Use Existing or\nCreate a New One.\n\n123\n00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,660\nAnd I've got a list from before, but\nI don't remember what's in it, so\n\n124\n00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,810\nI'm gonna create a new one.\n\n125\n00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,190\nAnd I'll just call it the ITProTV Domain.\n\n126\n00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,400\nAnd I'm gonna edit that and\nI'll add in just the ITPro.tv domain.\n\n127\n00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,820\nSo any time I send an email or\n\n128\n00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,200\nI receive an email from ITPro.tv,\nI'm gonna require TLS.\n\n129\n00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,860\nI've got it checked up here,\nI'm gonna require TLS.\n\n130\n00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,750\nThe most important option though\nis this one here at the bottom.\n\n131\n00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,650\nGoogle is already going to\nuse TLS if it's supported.\n\n132\n00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,900\nIt's only if it fails,\nthat it'll switch to unencrypted.\n\n133\n00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,200\nThe bottom option is the one that says,\ndon't do that, right?\n\n134\n00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,470\nIf TLS fails, just don't accept the email.\n\n135\n00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,570\nDon't allow it to come in.\n\n136\n00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,900\nIf you're not gonna set that,\n\n137\n00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,430\nif you leave that off, you might\nas well not even create the rule,\n\n138\n00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,350\nbecause it's already behaving\nthe way that you're configuring it.\n\n139\n00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,260\nSo, it's kind of a waste of time.\n\n140\n00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,600\nBut, if you check that off,\nnow it'll require it.\n\n141\n00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,090\nIf we send to that server and TLS is not\nsupported, then we won't send the email.\n\n142\n00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,360\nWe'll stop and that's it.\n\n143\n00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,590\nThe email will bounce.\n\n144\n00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,430\nAnd it's better to have it bounce than to\nsend it across the internet unencrypted.\n\n145\n00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,300\nNow once it makes it to that other server,\nthey could be mishandling it over there.\n\n146\n00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,690\nIt could be sent unencrypted\non their network.\n\n147\n00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,860\nWho knows, right?\n\n148\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,370\nWe don't have control over that.\n\n149\n00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,580\nBut for our side, we've done everything\nwe can to enforce that security.\n\n150\n00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,210\nSo when I add that setting in, now I've\ngot SSL being enforced for that domain.\n\n151\n00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,150\nAnd I could add more domains in there, or\nparticular email addresses, whatever it is\n\n152\n00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,530\nthat I need, and that's gonna enforce\nthe TLS side of things there.\n\n153\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,630\nSo, setting up security.\n\n154\n00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,630\nIt's pretty easy, right?\n\n155\n00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,990\nThat wasn't very hard.\n\n156\n00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,260\nBut it's not perfect.\n\n157\n00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,590\nIt doesn't give you end-to-end,\nclient-to-client encryption.\n\n158\n00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,270\nBut it takes care of\neverything that we can.\n\n159\n00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,590\nOur client to the server,\nour server to their server,\n\n160\n00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,890\nand then it's up to them to protect\ntheir server to their client.\n\n161\n00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,830\nAnd again, if you need that, if you need\ntrue end-to-end, you're gonna need to use\n\n162\n00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,150\nsomething like S/MIMEor PGP, GPG,\nany of those programs where your end\n\n163\n00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,030\nuser encrypts the message body and that\nway the email can be sent in plain text.\n\n164\n00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,826\nYou don't care,\nbecause the body is already encrypted.\n\n165\n00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,728\nThe servers don't have\nanything to do with it, right?\n\n166\n00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:10,985\nThat's the only true way to\nget good end-to-end security.\n\n167\n00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:15,571\nAll right, so in this segment we got a\nchance to look at configuring required SSL\n\n168\n00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,882\nfor accessing our Google App services and\nthen we took a look at doing TLS for\n\n169\n00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,460\nemail server to email server encryption.\n\n170\n00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,609\nBoth great ideas,\nthings that we want running, and for\n\n171\n00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,023\nthe most part on by\ndefault in Google Apps.\n\n172\n00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,636\nAll right,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n173\n00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,130\nStay tuned,\nwe have more Google Apps coming up.\n\n174\n00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,244\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:07,321\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:11,804\nObjective 4.4 focuses\non content compliance.\n\n3\n00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,149\nThe official title is demonstrate\nhow to filter messages\n\n4\n00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:19,940\nbased on general compliance settings,\ncontent and attachment settings.\n\n5\n00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,490\nAnd what that boils down to is looking\nat the emails that are passing through\n\n6\n00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,420\nyour system, and determining whether or\n\n7\n00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,990\nnot they should be allowed through\nbased on certain criteria that you set.\n\n8\n00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,360\nAnd we call that compliance.\n\n9\n00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,840\nIs it complaint with\nthe policy you define?\n\n10\n00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,300\nNow, where does that policy come from?\n\n11\n00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,270\nIt depends.\n\n12\n00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,300\nA lot of organizations have,\ncity, state, government,\n\n13\n00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,190\nnational government regulations they have\nto meet up to or just legal obligations,\n\n14\n00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,800\nliabilities, and things of that nature,\nthat dictate whether or\n\n15\n00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,900\nnot certain contents should be\nallowed to pass through your system.\n\n16\n00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,920\nNow, a lot of companies don't\ntake any action on this,\n\n17\n00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480\nthey just let it ride and that's fine.\n\n18\n00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,400\nBut for many organizations, they're very\nproactive in preventing the transmittal\n\n19\n00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400\nof documents containing things like foul\nlanguage or personal details or whatever.\n\n20\n00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,180\nAnd so you can modify the compliance\nsettings inside of Google Apps,\n\n21\n00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,370\nto help control that.\n\n22\n00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,000\nIt's pretty neat, and\nthere's actually a lot of options.\n\n23\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,010\nThe objective itself really focuses on\nthe content filtering but I wanna show you\n\n24\n00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,305\nguys each of the different compliance\nsettings that are in there.\n\n25\n00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,820\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at that, and\n\n26\n00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,390\nlet me just get my desktop\nshared out here real quick.\n\n27\n00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,720\nThere we go, all right, so we're\ngonna take a look at that real quick.\n\n28\n00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,610\nAnd what we'll do is we're gonna go\ninto Google Apps, and into our Gmail.\n\n29\n00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,090\nAnd I need to get into compliance,\nwhich is under Advanced Settings.\n\n30\n00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,530\nAnd you can use the little link\ndown here at the bottom, or\n\n31\n00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,650\nyou can just hit User Settings at the top,\nthey actually go to the same screen.\n\n32\n00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,570\nAnd once I'm in there,\n\n33\n00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,420\nwe can scroll down until we find\nthe section that says, Compliance.\n\n34\n00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,060\nSo we're just kind of keep looking,\nthere was user, end user settings,\n\n35\n00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,180\nend user access, and spam, compliance.\n\n36\n00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,380\nThere we go, scrolled a little too fast.\n\n37\n00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,920\nUnder compliance is where we'll see\nall the different compliance settings,\n\n38\n00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,820\nand it goes beyond, just a content filter.\n\n39\n00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,900\nAll right, we'll get to\nthe content filter in a second.\n\n40\n00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,310\nBut let's just kinda walk through some\nof the different options that we've got.\n\n41\n00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,700\nThe very first one is email retention, and\nyou've have to be careful with this one\n\n42\n00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,910\nbecause in your mind the word retention\nthat means retaining, keeping email, so\n\n43\n00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,430\nare we configuring how we keep email.\n\n44\n00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,520\nWell, not really, this one's actually\ndefining the maximum retention period.\n\n45\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,450\nIn other words how long you can\nkeep email before we destroy it.\n\n46\n00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,530\nLot of people don't realize this, if you\ncheck the average person's email box\n\n47\n00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,480\nthey'll have emails going back to when\ntheir account was originally setup.\n\n48\n00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,070\nSo if you created your\nemail account in 2001 you\n\n49\n00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,370\nmight have 14 years of data all\nsitting right there in your mailbox.\n\n50\n00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,260\nA lot of people do that, all right.\n\n51\n00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,590\nWell, what you're doing is you're actually\nexposing yourself to a liability.\n\n52\n00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,710\nFor a personal email account,\nit probably doesn't matter, but\n\n53\n00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,150\nfor a business account,\n\n54\n00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,900\nyou could have customer data that's stored\nin there that ten years ago was fine.\n\n55\n00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,020\nBut new government regulations have been\npassed that have changed the way that\n\n56\n00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,180\ncustomer data needs to be stored,\nand now you need it out of there.\n\n57\n00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,200\nAnd so what we can do is we can\nset a maximum retention period.\n\n58\n00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,360\nYou can come through and say,\nautomatically delete email messages for\n\n59\n00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,240\nusers, and then you can specify an age.\n\n60\n00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,140\nAutomatically delete email older than\na certain amount of days, all right?\n\n61\n00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,640\nSo, maybe in my company\nI have a rule that says\n\n62\n00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,520\nyou can't have emails beyond two years.\n\n63\n00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,859\nSo I could come in and set that, right?\n\n64\n00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,132\nTwo years would be, what is that,\n730 days, or something like that.\n\n65\n00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:43,698\nSo I would just specify in the box,\nthe numbers don't quite fit, but\n\n66\n00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:49,052\nI just put in 730 days, and then we've\ngot move messages to the trash folder or\n\n67\n00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,640\ndelete messages permanently.\n\n68\n00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,420\nWe're eliminating the liability of\npotentially storing data we shouldn't have\n\n69\n00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,730\nby saying, after two years,\njust wipe that data out.\n\n70\n00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,930\nNow, we're still liable for\nthe data that we do have,\n\n71\n00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,210\nthe last two years but\nwe may need to, well, we've got that.\n\n72\n00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,040\nWe need to educate our users over\nwhat they should and shouldn't have.\n\n73\n00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,670\nNow, you might be required by\nthe government to maintain data for\n\n74\n00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,810\na certain period of time.\n\n75\n00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,200\nYou don't wanna set this less\nthan that period of time.\n\n76\n00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,700\nOtherwise you'll need to have some other\nkind of archive of these emails, and\n\n77\n00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,150\nyou can use things like\nthe Google Vault Service or\n\n78\n00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,868\nthird parties can do that,\nto store all your emails for e-discovery.\n\n79\n00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,880\nAll right, so you can specify that.\n\n80\n00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,500\nYou can even specify labels\nthat are exceptions,\n\n81\n00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,170\nthings that you shouldn't wipe out.\n\n82\n00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,950\nSo you can enter those in, you can\nenter in as many labels as you want.\n\n83\n00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,190\nThey're separated with commas.\n\n84\n00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,135\nBut the default is this one right here.\n\n85\n00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:44,245\nDo not delete email\nmessages automatically,\n\n86\n00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:48,045\nin other words, it's never going\nto prune these emails out.\n\n87\n00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:52,635\nSo users can have emails as old as they\nwant, that's the default setting in here.\n\n88\n00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,855\nAll right the next setting is one that I\nknow we covered in another segment, but\n\n89\n00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:02,790\njust to recap it, it's the secure\ntransport, the TLS compliance entry.\n\n90\n00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,850\nAnd what that is,\nis server to server configuration or\n\n91\n00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,690\nserver to server security.\n\n92\n00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,410\nWhen we send an email through Google Apps,\nthe Google Apps servers have to transmit\n\n93\n00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,840\nit to the third party email server\nthat's hosting the recipient's account.\n\n94\n00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,170\nTLS is encryption using secure socket\nlayered between Google servers and\n\n95\n00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,010\nthat third party server.\n\n96\n00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,180\nGoogle will always try to use TLS, but\nif the other side doesn't support it\n\n97\n00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,510\nthe default is,\nwe'll just fall back to doing plain text.\n\n98\n00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,530\nIf you don't want that, right,\n\n99\n00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,620\nif you wanna ensure that it's encrypted,\nyou can turn that on right here to set it,\n\n100\n00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,920\nand you can see I've got it turned on\nfrom where we showed it in another show.\n\n101\n00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,130\nBut you can say whether it's required or\nwhether it's not.\n\n102\n00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,100\nAnother one, comprehensive mail storage.\n\n103\n00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,150\nThis is a really confusing one,\nby default,\n\n104\n00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,650\nif a user sends an email or receives\nan email it goes in their mailbox, right.\n\n105\n00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,600\nSo you would think if you looked in\nthe user's mailbox then all of their\n\n106\n00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,030\nemail would be right there.\n\n107\n00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,590\nBut there are some scenarios\nwhere a user's email does not\n\n108\n00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,090\nget stored in their mailbox, in which\ncase, when you look at their mailbox,\n\n109\n00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,440\nit's not comprehensive,\nit doesn't have all of their email.\n\n110\n00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,800\nSo you've got this option you can check\noff that says ensure that a copy of\n\n111\n00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,500\nall sent/received mail is stored\nin the associated user's mailbox.\n\n112\n00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,140\nYou would think that that was\nhow it normally happened.\n\n113\n00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,720\nWell, an example of an exception would\nbe if we were using mail routing.\n\n114\n00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,300\nWe might have a mail routing rule that\nsays if an email comes in to Don Pezet\n\n115\n00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,520\nthat's from some external sender,\nreroute it to a different location.\n\n116\n00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,220\nWell the mail routing rule applies\nbefore it makes it to my mailbox.\n\n117\n00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,500\nAnd so a copy of that email is\nnot logged in my mailbox, but\n\n118\n00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,930\nif I turn on comprehensive mail storage,\nit will be.\n\n119\n00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,270\nEven though I never had to interact with\nthe email, even though it got routed and\n\n120\n00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,890\nbounced right back out,\nan entry showing that email\n\n121\n00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,200\nhappened will be logged into my mailbox so\nit'll still be there.\n\n122\n00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,460\nAnd that's important if we need all\nof a users emails in one place.\n\n123\n00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,440\nOne place that we can look\nto see all of their content.\n\n124\n00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,820\nWe've got append footer,\nthis is a really popular one.\n\n125\n00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,590\nAppend footer says for\n\n126\n00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,700\nevery email that leaves our organization,\nstick a custom footer at the bottom.\n\n127\n00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,150\nAnd you see these all over the place,\npeople with email footers that say\n\n128\n00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,060\nthis email was intended for\nthe original recipient only.\n\n129\n00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,440\nIf you received this in error\nplease delete it immediately.\n\n130\n00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,660\nThings like that right.\n\n131\n00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,290\nUnauthorized use of this\nemail is prohibited.\n\n132\n00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,280\nUsually it's just words and so\nit doesn't actually do anything.\n\n133\n00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,300\nBut in a lot of countries it's important.\n\n134\n00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,340\nThe United States is\none of those countries.\n\n135\n00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,580\nWhen you send an email, emails are sent\nacross the internet in plain text by\n\n136\n00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,180\ndefault and the internet itself\nis viewed as a public area,\n\n137\n00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,370\nso if you're a hacker\nout on the internet and\n\n138\n00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,810\nyou intercept plain text emails,\nyou're allowed to.\n\n139\n00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,210\nYou're actually within your rights\nto do that, it was plain text and\n\n140\n00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,389\nit was sent over a public network,\nyou're allowed to intercept it.\n\n141\n00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,520\nBut by putting that message\nat the bottom of the email,\n\n142\n00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,590\nthat's called doing due diligence.\n\n143\n00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,170\nYou're saying I don't want this\nemail to be exposed to other people,\n\n144\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,770\nso if you're intercepting it,\nI don't want you to do that,\n\n145\n00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,110\nyou're doing something I've\nexpressly said you can't do.\n\n146\n00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,880\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n147\n00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,630\nthat turns that email from being\na public item to being a private item.\n\n148\n00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,810\nAnd while it doesn't\nactually enforce anything,\n\n149\n00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,450\nit doesn't make the hacker's job\nany easier or harder or whatever.\n\n150\n00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,370\nIt actually doesn't make\nany difference whatsoever.\n\n151\n00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,730\nWhere it makes a difference\nis in the courtroom.\n\n152\n00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,040\nWhen you go to court and\n\n153\n00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,950\nyou show that these emails were\ninappropriately intercepted,\n\n154\n00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,820\nyou can show where it was plainly written\nin your footer that that wasn't allowed.\n\n155\n00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,480\nThat you didn't want that,\nthat you expressly prohibited that and\n\n156\n00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,520\nthat's important, right?\n\n157\n00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,320\nIt sounds silly to us, but\nit is important in the court system.\n\n158\n00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,860\nSo we've got that footer\ndoing a punch in there.\n\n159\n00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,190\nYou could be using it for something a lot\nmore simple, just stick a company logo or\n\n160\n00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,946\nwhatever, but usually it's\na legal disclaimer of some sort.\n\n161\n00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:59,725\nAll right, some of the other\nthings restrict delivery.\n\n162\n00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:04,075\nAll right, you can specifically block\ndomains that we're allowed to communicate\n\n163\n00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,865\nwith, or allow domains that we're\nallowed to communicate with.\n\n164\n00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:09,995\nNormally when you block, you go and\nyou use the blacklists, right,\n\n165\n00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:12,060\nthe blacklists are pretty effective for\nthat.\n\n166\n00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,770\nBut there are companies where they\nprovide email to their clients, or\n\n167\n00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,940\nnot their clients but their employees, and\n\n168\n00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,200\nthey just want the employees to\nbe able to email each other.\n\n169\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,040\nThey don't people emailing\noutside of the company because\n\n170\n00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,280\nmaybe they don't want\nthem to leak documents.\n\n171\n00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,560\nSo they don't wanna leak corporate\ninformation out using email so\n\n172\n00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,830\nthey prevent it.\n\n173\n00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:34,370\nOr, maybe they just don't want people\ndoing non-work activities at work.\n\n174\n00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,690\nAll right, think about the emails\nyou get throughout the day.\n\n175\n00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,990\nA lot of them are work related.\n\n176\n00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,420\nBut some of them are hey,\nyou wanna go to lunch or\n\n177\n00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,970\nthere's a softball game after work.\n\n178\n00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,310\nThese kinds of things with\npublic emails external emails\n\n179\n00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,220\nthat aren't really work related.\n\n180\n00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,165\nWell if we close off our Google apps and\nnot allow emailing outside.\n\n181\n00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,070\nNow it becomes an internal\ncollaboration tool.\n\n182\n00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,380\nSo if you edit that restrict delivery,\nyou'll see in here where you can specify\n\n183\n00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,400\nparticular domains to be rejected or\nto be allowed so you can create a list and\n\n184\n00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,780\nsay these are the only domains\nthat you're allowed to email.\n\n185\n00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,150\nAnd so you can build that\nrestriction list right there.\n\n186\n00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:17,140\nAll right, the ones that are called out\nspecifically by the exam objective though\n\n187\n00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,540\nare these last three.\n\n188\n00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,230\nContent, objectionable content,\nand attachment compliance.\n\n189\n00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,580\nThese three, right.\n\n190\n00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,440\nThey all work the same way.\n\n191\n00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,890\nContent compliance, what it does\nis it looks at an email content,\n\n192\n00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,190\nlooks at the message,\nand what it looks for\n\n193\n00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,470\nare certain words or phrases or\nstrings of characters.\n\n194\n00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,250\nSo it looks for a set of content stops\nthe email based on what it finds.\n\n195\n00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,850\nWhen you go to configure it, you tell\nit whether you're doing inbound or\n\n196\n00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,970\noutbound, internal sending or\ninternal receiving, so\n\n197\n00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,020\nif you wanna filter everything, you can\ngo through and just check them all off.\n\n198\n00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,597\nSo now we're gonna filter every\nsingle email through this,\n\n199\n00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:59,430\nand then you can specify your criteria.\n\n200\n00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,740\nAnd the criteria is done with\nan expression, which is kind of neat.\n\n201\n00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,220\nSo when we go in and add the expression\nin we punch in what it is we wanna do and\n\n202\n00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,350\nthere's a simple content match.\n\n203\n00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,570\nSimple content matches are nice because\nthey do well just words, right.\n\n204\n00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,945\nSo there might be swear words or\nphrases that I want to block.\n\n205\n00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,515\nYou can specify various things you want\nto specifically block on that content.\n\n206\n00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:26,345\nBut you can also choose to\ndo things like advanced\n\n207\n00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:31,205\ncontent matches where you can look in\nthe header and look at specific text.\n\n208\n00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,525\nOr metadata matches where\nyou are looking for\n\n209\n00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:40,080\nother values insider of there like message\nauthentication, source IP, message size.\n\n210\n00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,710\nAll sorts of different things that we\ncan look for to choose to allow or\n\n211\n00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,860\ndeny the e-mail to pass through, right?\n\n212\n00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,070\nCriteria that have to be met, and\n\n213\n00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,440\nif they meet that criteria we can\ntake some kind of action, right?\n\n214\n00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,980\nAnd the action we take is normally\ngoing to be to block the e-mail,\n\n215\n00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,450\nto stop it from transmitting.\n\n216\n00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,640\nBut you can do other things like,\nyou can change the route Or\n\n217\n00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,470\nchange the recipient to\nsend it somewhere else.\n\n218\n00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,560\nSo instead of sending it out\nto the original recipient, we\n\n219\n00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,900\nflagged this as inappropriate so maybe we\nsend this to our administrators instead.\n\n220\n00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,060\nAnd that way they can see that this\ninappropriate email was being sent,\n\n221\n00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,150\nthey can evaluate it, and\nthey can take the appropriate action.\n\n222\n00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,582\nSo at least we have that\nfunctionality right there.\n\n223\n00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:22,510\nAll right, and you can always create\nexceptions down here with the bypass\n\n224\n00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,962\noptions, so you may need that.\n\n225\n00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:30,070\nAll right now objectionable content\nthis one sounds very similar\n\n226\n00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,250\nto content compliance with objectionable\ncontent we filter based on words.\n\n227\n00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,950\nAnd we'll normally use these\nthings like swear words, races,\n\n228\n00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,100\nhate speak things like that you can\nput in various terms to filter on.\n\n229\n00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,200\nThe big difference here is this one's\na lot more limited, up here it's words,\n\n230\n00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,950\nphrases, or patterns.\n\n231\n00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,300\nYou have a lot of power there, right?\n\n232\n00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,365\nHere, it's just words, it's a word list.\n\n233\n00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:57,720\nBut when we go into configure, you can\nspecify the emails that you wanna filter,\n\n234\n00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,210\nand then you can specify your custom\nobjectionable words and it's just a list.\n\n235\n00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,190\nYou add in the words that you don't\nwant people to send via email.\n\n236\n00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,740\nSo you think of all the different\nthings that you might want.\n\n237\n00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,820\nSo if you have\na professional organization,\n\n238\n00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,480\nyou shouldn't be using\nswear words in your email.\n\n239\n00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480\nSo you can type those out.\n\n240\n00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,260\nI'll spare us entering the vast\nlexicon that I have in there.\n\n241\n00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,770\nSo [LAUGH] but\nyou put in the various things.\n\n242\n00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,010\nThis is really handy because it can\navoid a lot of awkward situations.\n\n243\n00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,710\nYou know, emails,\n\n244\n00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,000\nonce they're out of your organization\nyou no longer have control of them.\n\n245\n00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,580\nSo in theory, they could last forever.\n\n246\n00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,450\nSo you might have an employee from five\nyears ago, that sent out an inappropriate\n\n247\n00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,690\nemail, like one of those bad joke\nemails or something like that.\n\n248\n00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,160\nAnd just now, someone finds it,\nposts to Twitter, it goes viral and\n\n249\n00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,080\nall of the sudden your\ncompany is under the gun for\n\n250\n00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,110\nsomething an employee did many years ago.\n\n251\n00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,070\nBy blocking that content here,\nit never happens in the first place.\n\n252\n00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,930\nSo, the only real difference between\nthese two is how much power we have.\n\n253\n00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,840\nObjectionable content is just looking for\nkey words.\n\n254\n00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,240\nContent compliance goes beyond that and\nletting us do patterns and\n\n255\n00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,629\nother criteria to determine\nwhether it gets filtered.\n\n256\n00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,700\nAttachment compliance is the same\nthing except for attachments, and\n\n257\n00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,620\nit normally takes a much\nmore simpler stance,\n\n258\n00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,350\nwhich is either strip\nthe attachment off or don't, right.\n\n259\n00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,960\nBut you can do it based on file type,\nname or message size.\n\n260\n00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,290\nSo when you go through here and\ndictate the settings for\n\n261\n00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,280\nthe attachment you can\nspecify all sorts of things,\n\n262\n00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,540\nlike particular attachment types\nthat you wanna block or allow.\n\n263\n00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,380\nThey've got pre built ones in here, for\npictures, music, videos, and so on or\n\n264\n00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,830\nyou can type your own file extensions.\n\n265\n00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,465\nThe file type is just down\nby an extension, though.\n\n266\n00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,735\nAnd so\nthis can be a little easy to defeat.\n\n267\n00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:52,065\nSomebody can just change the file\nextension and they can get around it.\n\n268\n00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:56,125\nFor that, if we wanna be really detailed,\nwe need something like MIME types,\n\n269\n00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,690\nwhich it doesn't do.\n\n270\n00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,680\nBut filename is another one we can\njust look for particular filenames or\n\n271\n00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,940\nmessage sizes.\n\n272\n00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,440\nYou could block emails that are over a\ncertain size and strip their attachments.\n\n273\n00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,020\nStripping the attachment\nis what you normally do.\n\n274\n00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,840\nIf you look down here\nin the modify options,\n\n275\n00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,630\nyou'll see attachments, remove attachment.\n\n276\n00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,050\nSo you can strip it out and put a little\nnote in here that it was Stripped out.\n\n277\n00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,840\nThat way the email still gets through,\nbut the attachment was stripped out.\n\n278\n00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,460\nThe alternative would be not\nto strip the attachment but\n\n279\n00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,450\nto reject the email as a whole.\n\n280\n00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,606\nAnd so we could do that and\njust not send it along or reroute it or\n\n281\n00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:33,062\nwhatever it was that we\nwanted to do from there.\n\n282\n00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:40,200\nAll right, so those are the ones\nthat deal with content, right?\n\n283\n00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,040\nOur content filtering.\n\n284\n00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,300\nYou'll notice that as I went into there,\nthere weren't any default settings.\n\n285\n00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,190\nWe have to put them in ourselves.\n\n286\n00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,520\nSo if you wanna create\nan objectionable word list, or\n\n287\n00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,600\nwhatever- You're going to\nneed to make that list.\n\n288\n00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680\nStill to get with your HR department or\nyour CIO or whoever, and come up with\n\n289\n00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,160\nthat list of words that are going to be\nbanned will be to get them put in there.\n\n290\n00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,240\nSame thing goes for any other criteria\nhere that we want to block on.\n\n291\n00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,910\nWe're basically just\nacting on behest of our\n\n292\n00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,300\nHR department is how it normally works.\n\n293\n00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,880\nThey tell us the criteria,\nwe set up the filter.\n\n294\n00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:14,670\nAll right so in this segment we got\na chance to see the compliance settings\n\n295\n00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,710\ninside of Google apps and some of\nthe different filters that were available.\n\n296\n00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,380\nQuite a few different things\nfrom appending footers\n\n297\n00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,140\nto restricting attachments,\nquite a bit of stuff in there.\n\n298\n00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,521\nIt's really neat, really useful, and\n\n299\n00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,353\ndefinitely something you\nshould take advantage of.\n\n300\n00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,338\nAll right,\nwell I hope you enjoyed the segment.\n\n301\n00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:32,742\nStay tuned we've got more\nGoogle apps coming up.\n\n302\n00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:39,359\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,897\n[SOUND] Objective 5.1 covers creating\n\n2\n00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:13,007\na shared calendar inside\nof your organization.\n\n3\n00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:17,393\nWhen you set up Google Apps and you start\ncreating your user accounts in there,\n\n4\n00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,660\na personal calendar is created for\nevery single account.\n\n5\n00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,940\nThat's fine, right,\nif that's all you need, you're done.\n\n6\n00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,400\nYou actually don't have to lift a finger.\n\n7\n00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,230\nThe personal calendars are there and\nyou're in business.\n\n8\n00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,190\nBut the whole point of having\na collaboration platform like Google Apps\n\n9\n00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,880\nis being able to share data.\n\n10\n00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,410\nAnd so one of the common activities\nof a company is to create a single\n\n11\n00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,160\ncentralized calendar.\n\n12\n00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,650\nThis been shared out\namongst the employees.\n\n13\n00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,080\nThat way they can all see\nwhat each other is doing\n\n14\n00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,190\nvery easily right there\nin one big calendar.\n\n15\n00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,260\nThat may not be for you,\n\n16\n00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,040\nyou may want to do a mixture where\npeople have their personal calendars.\n\n17\n00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,230\nBut then you have a company calendar that\nmanages various corporate wide events.\n\n18\n00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,800\nLike days off and other company events.\n\n19\n00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,580\nOr you might do like us at ITProTV,\nwe have countless number of calendars.\n\n20\n00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,000\nSo each employee has their own calendar.\n\n21\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,850\nThen we have our company calendar\nwhere we track events and\n\n22\n00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,320\nvacations, sick days things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,585\nAnd then we have our show calendar\nwhere we keep track of what show is on\n\n24\n00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:15,810\nwhich days.\n\n25\n00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,680\nEach calendar is separate so that we\ncan control the sharing aspect of it.\n\n26\n00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,180\nSo for example our episode calendar,\nwe share that out with the public, anybody\n\n27\n00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,890\ncan see that one cause we want you to know\nwhat episodes we're filming and what days.\n\n28\n00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,110\nBut then our vacation calendar where\nwe check employee vacations we don't\n\n29\n00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,272\npost that to everybody because\nyou guys don't care about that.\n\n30\n00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:38,030\n[LAUGH].\nAnd so we don't want to make that public.\n\n31\n00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,520\nSo it's on a private calendar.\n\n32\n00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,030\nCreating multiple calendars allows you\nto tweak the sharing aspect of it,\n\n33\n00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,750\nand that's the real value of\na collaboration platform like Google Apps.\n\n34\n00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,160\nAll right.\n\n35\n00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,030\nSo before we get to\nworking with calendars,\n\n36\n00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,000\nit's important that we adjust\nthe default sharing settings.\n\n37\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560\nIn Google Apps, there's some default\nsharing settings that are in place,\n\n38\n00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,250\nand every time you create a new calendar,\n\n39\n00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,610\nthe sharing settings are copied\nfrom this default kind of template.\n\n40\n00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,110\nAll right?\n\n41\n00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,270\nIf we go and change these settings after\nthe calendars are created, it's too late.\n\n42\n00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,640\nThe default settings only apply\nwhen a new calendar is created.\n\n43\n00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,510\nFor existing calendars,\nif we wanna go back and\n\n44\n00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,020\nbulk update them, you've got to either do\nit by hand or do it through API calls,\n\n45\n00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:28,080\nthe Advanced Program Interface to reach\nin and make those changes in the system.\n\n46\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560\nSo obviously that's not ideal for\na lot of people.\n\n47\n00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,310\nWe want to make sure we get the default\nsetting in place from the beginning.\n\n48\n00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,750\nSo in my admin console, I'm gonna go to\nGoogle Apps and then I'll go to Calendar.\n\n49\n00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,980\nAnd it's right here in the Calendar that\nI'll see my sharing settings, right here,\n\n50\n00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,890\nand that's what I want to work with.\n\n51\n00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,690\nWhen we go into the sharing settings,\nthese are gonna be the default sharing\n\n52\n00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,070\nsettings for new calendars to\nget created in my environment.\n\n53\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,110\nSo these settings right here we can tweak,\n\n54\n00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,110\nthey're not going to affect any calendar\nI've already got, just the new ones.\n\n55\n00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,670\nThe first section or\nthe external sharing options, and\n\n56\n00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,940\nnotice how it says external sharing\noptions for primary calendars.\n\n57\n00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,440\nWhat the heck is a primary calendar?\n\n58\n00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240\nEvery time you create a user account,\nthey get,\n\n59\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,780\nI called it a personal\naccount a minute ago,\n\n60\n00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,420\nright, it's a calendar attached to their\naccount, that's their primary calendar.\n\n61\n00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,400\nSo for all of your users,\nthe default is, well,\n\n62\n00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,560\npeople outside of ITProTV,\nthat's my organization.\n\n63\n00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,680\nSo people outside of your organization can\njust see free, busy data, and that's it.\n\n64\n00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,320\nFree busy data and nothing else.\n\n65\n00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,580\nSo if I have an appointment\ntomorrow from 3 PM to 4 PM and\n\n66\n00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,600\none of you out there in internet\nland were to access my calendar,\n\n67\n00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,580\nyou would just see that I'm\nbusy between 3 and 4 PM.\n\n68\n00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,220\nYou wouldn't see what it was,\nwhat I was doing.\n\n69\n00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,410\nYou would just that I was\nbusy during that time.\n\n70\n00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,720\nThat's the default.\n\n71\n00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,990\nWe may not want that.\n\n72\n00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,040\nWe may want to tweak that.\n\n73\n00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,700\nOr, maybe I do want you\nguys to be able to see it.\n\n74\n00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,750\nWe can kind of do various things.\n\n75\n00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,710\nLike share all information, but\noutsiders cannot change it.\n\n76\n00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,380\nSo now, you guys will be\nable to see my calendar and\n\n77\n00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,110\nyou'd be able to see the appointment.\n\n78\n00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,420\nBut you wouldn't be able to modify it.\n\n79\n00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,010\nOr we could say, you can see\nthe appointment and you can modify it.\n\n80\n00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,620\nNow, why the heck would I want to\nallow the internet to modify my own\n\n81\n00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,975\npersonal calendar?\n\n82\n00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,745\nNormally you wouldn't, right.\n\n83\n00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:25,635\nBut, if you've got some kind of\nan event and you're inviting people and\n\n84\n00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:29,005\nallowing them to accept the invitation and\nbe listed on there as attending and\n\n85\n00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,845\nyou want them to put in notes, then\nsomething like this becomes very handy.\n\n86\n00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,815\nThe last option is the most dangerous.\n\n87\n00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:38,415\nIt's share all information and\nallow managing of calendars.\n\n88\n00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,935\nSo now, they could go in there and\nchange the calendar itself\n\n89\n00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,930\nas far as changing who it's shared with or\neven delete the calendar.\n\n90\n00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,980\nAnd we're typically not\ngoing to want that option.\n\n91\n00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,930\nAll right,\nthe next one is internal sharing,\n\n92\n00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,010\nthat was external sharing with people\noutside of your Google Apps organization.\n\n93\n00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,990\nBut internal sharing, that's gonna be for\nwell, your internal employees, the people\n\n94\n00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,070\nwho have accounts in Google Apps and the\ndefault here is to share all information.\n\n95\n00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,770\nOther employees can see\nexactly what I have scheduled\n\n96\n00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,790\nfrom 3 to 4 PM tomorrow where\nI'm going to be, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,840\nBut we can change that to only free busy,\nor to no sharing.\n\n98\n00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,900\nNow remember, this is the default.\n\n99\n00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,010\nUsers can go and\nchange these after the fact if they want.\n\n100\n00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,180\nThey can modify the calendar\nto whatever setting they want.\n\n101\n00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,460\nSo you usually want to set this\nto be the most restrictive and\n\n102\n00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,000\nallow people to open it up as desired.\n\n103\n00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,100\nYou've also got the ability to turn\non Video Calls and Calendar Labs.\n\n104\n00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,590\nThese are additional features.\n\n105\n00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,160\nWhen you create an event on your calendar,\nyou can attach a Video Call to it.\n\n106\n00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,010\nSo when you invite people to it and\nit's time for that meeting,\n\n107\n00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,480\nthey can all quickly fire up\na Google Hangout, a video conference.\n\n108\n00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,510\nTo carry off that meeting.\n\n109\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,350\nIt's a neat feature, but\nyou can disable that.\n\n110\n00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,990\nSame thing with Calendar Labs.\n\n111\n00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,050\nThose are labs features, the experimental\nfeatures for the calendar.\n\n112\n00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,150\nYou can choose whether you wanna turn\nthose on or off for your organization.\n\n113\n00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,500\nAll right, now notice how it\nwas our primary calendar.\n\n114\n00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,560\nWhat about our secondary calendars?\n\n115\n00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680\nSecondary calendars are any\nother calendar you create.\n\n116\n00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,710\nIf I wanna create a single calendar\nthat's shared across my entire company,\n\n117\n00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,890\nI don't want that to be tied to my\naccount because, what if I get fired?\n\n118\n00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,390\nRight?\nNow my account goes away and\n\n119\n00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,740\nthat calendar goes away.\n\n120\n00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,320\nSo we wanna create a shared\ncalendar that everybody can get to.\n\n121\n00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,240\nWell, any custom calendars that you\ncreate are secondary calendars.\n\n122\n00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,822\nAnd they're not covered by\nthe settings right here.\n\n123\n00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:28,870\nAll right?\n\n124\n00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,540\nThe settings here, and\nremember how I got to this, right,\n\n125\n00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,480\nI went from my admin panel and\nI went to Google Apps,\n\n126\n00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,010\nI went to Calendar, and\nthen I went in to Sharing settings, right?\n\n127\n00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,360\nThat's where I got in to\nmodify the primary calendar.\n\n128\n00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,820\nFor the secondary settings, I actually\nhave to go back to my calendar page.\n\n129\n00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,480\nAnd that was under Sharing settings.\n\n130\n00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,850\nNow I'm going to down\nhere to General settings.\n\n131\n00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,150\nUnder General settings, is where we'll\nsee options for our secondary calendars.\n\n132\n00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,310\nAnd the options are the same.\n\n133\n00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,780\nLet me move this over a little bit.\n\n134\n00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,960\nYou'll see external sharing options,\nand then,\n\n135\n00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,340\nhere it is, Only free/busy,\nshare data and they can change.\n\n136\n00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,630\nIt's the same as the sharing for a primary\ncalendar, it's just in a different place.\n\n137\n00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,630\nIt's moved off to a different location,\nand\n\n138\n00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,240\nwe can adjust the default values there.\n\n139\n00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,260\nAll right.\n\n140\n00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,600\nSo those are the settings\nas far as my calendars.\n\n141\n00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,610\nNow when I start to create them,\nthey're going to have those settings, and\n\n142\n00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,720\nI can override them as needed.\n\n143\n00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,940\nAll right.\nSo next,\n\n144\n00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,360\nlet's take a look at actually\ngetting a shared calendar in place.\n\n145\n00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,000\nOkay.\n\n146\n00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,701\nIf I want to create a shared calendar,\n\n147\n00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,316\nthe first thing I need to do is\nto log into Google calendar.\n\n148\n00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:46,692\nAnd you'll see right here it has\nthe URL that you can use, and it's\n\n149\n00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:51,698\njust www.google.com/calendar/hosted/your\ndomain.\n\n150\n00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:52,302\nAll right.\n\n151\n00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,904\nThat's a long URL.\n\n152\n00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:57,100\nYou might want to change that,\nand you can hit edit and\n\n153\n00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,950\nmodify what that URL is that your\nusers are going to be typing in.\n\n154\n00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,160\nAnd you'll see where you\ncan set up a custom one,\n\n155\n00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,780\nlike I could do calendar.itprotv.net.\n\n156\n00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,435\nNow, they don't mention it here, but\nyou actually get to it by just going to\n\n157\n00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:14,870\ncalendar.google.com, also, and\nyou'll go in and have access to it.\n\n158\n00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,620\nBut this is the official URL to be able\nto browse in and gain access to that.\n\n159\n00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620\nIf I set one of these shortcuts, I'll need\nto go modify my DNS records to contain\n\n160\n00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,600\na record that will point\nright back to this other URL.\n\n161\n00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,970\nThey give instructions\nto that right there.\n\n162\n00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,300\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nbrowse into my calendar.\n\n163\n00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,190\nAnd when I get logged in,\nI'm already authenticated, so\n\n164\n00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,480\nI didn't get prompted in again.\n\n165\n00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,810\nSo it'll take me right in.\n\n166\n00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,280\nAnd here I am, and under my calendars,\nI'll see Don Pezet.\n\n167\n00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,589\nThat's my primary calendar.\n\n168\n00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,660\nThat's the personal calendar\nthat was created just for\n\n169\n00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,460\nme when my user account was created.\n\n170\n00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,090\nAnd so it's already got the various\nsettings copied from that default.\n\n171\n00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,100\nWell not the ones we just\nchanged a minute ago, but\n\n172\n00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,910\nfrom when it was set when my user\naccount was originally created.\n\n173\n00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,840\nAnd you can always click on that and\nyou'll see Share this calendar.\n\n174\n00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520\nAnd when you go in to Share this calendar,\n\n175\n00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,860\nyou'll see where you can modify\nhow that calendar is handled.\n\n176\n00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,920\nRight off,\nit's share this calendar with others, and\n\n177\n00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,630\nyou can choose to make\nthe calendar public.\n\n178\n00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,860\nYou can allow external\npeople to see your calendar.\n\n179\n00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,180\nAnd you can choose whether they just\nsee the free busy data or whatever.\n\n180\n00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,160\nSame thing with share this calendar\nwith everyone in the organization.\n\n181\n00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,070\nThat's all the internal people.\n\n182\n00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,320\nIt's set to see all event details\nbecause that was the default but\n\n183\n00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,051\nI can change that to override\nthe settings if I desire.\n\n184\n00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:44,260\nWe'll also see in here where we can\ndelegate access for that calendar.\n\n185\n00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,210\nJust because this is a personal\ncalendar doesn't mean I'm the only\n\n186\n00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,660\none that may need it.\n\n187\n00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,490\nI may want, maybe I've got an assistant.\n\n188\n00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,190\nI've been asking for\nan assistant since this company started.\n\n189\n00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,210\nSo maybe I have an assistant and I want\nthem to be able to see my calendar so they\n\n190\n00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,760\ncan add events to it and they can remind\nwhen there's an event coming up, right?\n\n191\n00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,151\nSo I may want to add them in here and\nso I'll go and add another person so\n\n192\n00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:10,030\nyou've got this share\nwith specific people.\n\n193\n00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,200\nAnd I'll go in here and\npunch in another employee.\n\n194\n00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,894\nMaybe we'll punch in Gar Samuelson here.\n\n195\n00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:19,850\nI'm gonna pick Gar, and\nI will give him not just see all events,\n\n196\n00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,040\nI wanna give him make changes and\nmanage sharing.\n\n197\n00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,310\nI want Gar to have full\naccess to my calendar.\n\n198\n00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,770\nHe's my assistant,\nI want him to have that access.\n\n199\n00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,980\nAnd if he wants to add an event, great.\n\n200\n00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,070\nOr if he wants to share my calendar\nwith someone else he can do it\n\n201\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,790\nhe's got that full access and\nthe ability to change it.\n\n202\n00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,530\nWhen I hit save, Gar now has that access.\n\n203\n00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,860\nHe can go and add my calendar to his\nscreen and he'll see Gar Samuelson\n\n204\n00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,000\nas his personal calendar and he'll see\nDon Pezet as a secondary calendar.\n\n205\n00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,770\nYou add calendars right\nhere under My Calendars.\n\n206\n00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,630\nIf you hit that drop down arrow you can\ncreate a new one if you want to build\n\n207\n00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,890\none from scratch.\n\n208\n00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,880\nBut if you want to attach to someone\nelse's you use this Other calendar.\n\n209\n00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,310\nSee how it says add a coworkers calendar?\n\n210\n00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,520\nAnd so you can type in somebody's name and\nhe would type in Don Pezet and\n\n211\n00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,450\nyou could find me and add it in.\n\n212\n00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,880\nSee how I just added this calendar?\n\n213\n00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,920\nWell, I'm a super administrator,\nand as a super administrator,\n\n214\n00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,250\nI have access to everybody's calendars.\n\n215\n00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,240\nBut if he were to do it, he wouldn't have\naccess unless somebody shared it with him.\n\n216\n00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,060\nAnd that's what I just did.\n\n217\n00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,210\nI delegated my calendar out to him so\nhe'd be able to view it.\n\n218\n00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,635\nSo, now what I'm seeing is actually\na combination of my calendar and Gar's.\n\n219\n00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,640\nI'm seeing both, now I guess I\ndon't really have any events here.\n\n220\n00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,340\nI could quick create some.\n\n221\n00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,070\nSo this would be like Don's event.\n\n222\n00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,180\nAnd then I'll create Gar's event.\n\n223\n00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,940\nAnd see how I've got this drop down\nbox where I pick whose calendar i'm\n\n224\n00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,970\ncreating it on.\n\n225\n00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,758\nSo I see a mixture and\nit's colored, right?\n\n226\n00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:52,372\nSo I've got purple for\nmy event and blue for Gar's and\n\n227\n00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:55,774\nthey're kind of mixed\ntogether all right there.\n\n228\n00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,581\nNow we're working we're\ndelegating it out and\n\n229\n00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,470\nGar can start to take care\nof my calendar for me.\n\n230\n00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,430\nAll right.\n\n231\n00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,960\nBut this isn't a shared\nlike a generic calendar.\n\n232\n00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,500\nSo if I wanna create a generic calendar,\nwell, I need to create a new calendar.\n\n233\n00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,560\nSo, I'm gonna go to My Calendars,\nand I'll hit that down arrow.\n\n234\n00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,200\nAnd I'm gonna create a new calendar.\n\n235\n00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,160\nAnd I'm going to call this\nmy shared office calendar.\n\n236\n00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,280\nSo this will be the office calendar I\nwant everyone in my company to use for\n\n237\n00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,540\ncompany events.\n\n238\n00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,240\nSo I can type a description for that,\nand whatever other settings that I want.\n\n239\n00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,030\nNow just like on a personal calendar,\nI've got where I can delegate it out and\n\n240\n00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,980\nactually I forgot to mention something.\n\n241\n00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,610\nNotice down here I've got share\nthis calendar with others, and\n\n242\n00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,250\nthen I've got share with specific people.\n\n243\n00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,890\nAll right.\n\n244\n00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,240\nSo if I choose to share it with others,\nand then I come in here and I say,\n\n245\n00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680\nshare this calendar with everyone in the\norganization and let them see all event\n\n246\n00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,770\ndetails, and then down here I set\nsomething different, like I set up Gar And\n\n247\n00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,895\nI give Gar, you know maybe I'll give Gar,\nsee only free busy data.\n\n248\n00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:03,540\nOkay?\n\n249\n00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,910\nWell, because I said share it with others\nand let them see all event details,\n\n250\n00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,335\nthis will override the setting down here.\n\n251\n00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:12,410\nOkay?\n\n252\n00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,770\nThe share calendar with others\noverrides share with specific people.\n\n253\n00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,690\nIf Share with others gives more\npermissions than Share with specific\n\n254\n00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,690\npeople, then Share with others wins.\n\n255\n00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,480\nIt's a little confusing, though,\ncause if it's the other way around,\n\n256\n00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,170\nif I choose not to share it with other\npeople at all, but down here I give Gar\n\n257\n00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,480\nsome kind of high-end privileges like\nmake changes and manage sharing.\n\n258\n00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,200\nRight?\n\n259\n00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,770\nWell, even though he doesn't have\naccess under Share with others,\n\n260\n00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,220\nhe will get access from down here, right?\n\n261\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,370\nSo it's only when Share with others gives\nyou more permission than the Share with\n\n262\n00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,150\nspecific people that it overrides,\nbut it does override, all right?\n\n263\n00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,510\nSo I'm gonna say share this counter\nwith everyone in ITProTV and\n\n264\n00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,270\nI'll just let them see all event details.\n\n265\n00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,530\nThen I need to pick who my\ncounter administrators are.\n\n266\n00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,230\nWho's gonna be creating events.\n\n267\n00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,510\nAnd down here, I'll need to give them\nat least make changes to events so\n\n268\n00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,740\nthey can go in and\ncreate those events and make changes.\n\n269\n00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,070\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,050\nSo once I've got that specified.\n\n271\n00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,340\nI've now got a nice, shared calendar.\n\n272\n00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,580\nIt's available.\n\n273\n00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,740\nAnd I can go ahead and create it.\n\n274\n00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,250\nAll right.\n\n275\n00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,790\nMy other end users,\nif they want to add this calendar,\n\n276\n00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,490\nall they have to do is go to other\ncalendars and kind of type it in.\n\n277\n00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,100\nAnd it will come up in the list.\n\n278\n00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,850\nIt's not gonna come up for\nme because I've already got it there.\n\n279\n00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,500\nBut they can type it in and add it.\n\n280\n00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,200\nYou can also browse and find it.\n\n281\n00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,660\nIf you hit the little down arrow here you\ncan choose browse interesting calendars.\n\n282\n00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,950\nGot to be interesting.\n\n283\n00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,220\nAnd when you browse it, by default you're\ngoing to see things like holiday and\n\n284\n00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,020\nsporting calendars but if you go to more,\nunder more, you'll start to see\n\n285\n00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,200\nvarious other calendars in your company,\ncontact, birthdays and so on.\n\n286\n00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,140\nAnd so if we've got something like\na resource calendar or whatever,\n\n287\n00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,430\nthey'll start to show up in here.\n\n288\n00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,560\nAnd you can find the calendars this way.\n\n289\n00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120\nYou can also add them by a URL.\n\n290\n00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,870\nEvery calendar has a address.\n\n291\n00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,850\nIf I go back to my, whoops.\n\n292\n00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,200\nIf I go back to my main screen,\nwhich I've just navigated away from here.\n\n293\n00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,190\nAnd we take a calendar like\nthat Shared Office Calendar.\n\n294\n00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,720\nWhen I click on it and\ngo to Share this Calendar,\n\n295\n00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,400\nyou'll see information about the calendar\nin here and the URL is listed,\n\n296\n00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,240\nlet's see I think that's actually\nback under calendar details.\n\n297\n00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,120\nSo under the Calendar details tab, if you\nscroll down, here's the calendar address\n\n298\n00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,340\nand they give you links for\nXML, ICAL, and HTML.\n\n299\n00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,040\nAnd so you can copy that link address for\nHTML and you can share that with people.\n\n300\n00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,430\nYou can give them that address and you'll\nbe able to quickly add it that way too.\n\n301\n00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,510\nThat's adding it by a URL.\n\n302\n00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,720\nSo several different ways for them to\nadd that calendar to their account.\n\n303\n00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,950\nBut once it's added,\nnow they've got it and\n\n304\n00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,440\nthey've got that central shared\noffice calendar available to them.\n\n305\n00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,940\nAll right.\n\n306\n00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,610\nSo couple of different ways to go\nabout it, but that's where it is.\n\n307\n00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,770\nIf you're done with this calendar and\nyou don't want it anymore,\n\n308\n00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,220\nyou'll see that permanently delete this\ncalendar option down at the bottom.\n\n309\n00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,689\nThat'll wipe it out and\nget the calendar out of your company.\n\n310\n00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,290\nJust because somebody disconnects\nit from their account, right,\n\n311\n00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,220\nlike if I go back to my own page.\n\n312\n00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,360\nLet me get back in here.\n\n313\n00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,510\nIf I go back to\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,390\n>> Copy that URL.\n\n315\n00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,570\nLet me get this URL here.\n\n316\n00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,760\nIf I go back to the calendar and\n\n317\n00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,560\nI just remove the calendar from my\nview that doesn't actually delete it.\n\n318\n00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,700\nSo I created that shared office calendar,\nand if I go in here and\n\n319\n00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,020\nchoose hide this calendar from the list.\n\n320\n00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,750\nThat'll take it out of my list.\n\n321\n00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,110\nBut the calendar still exists,\nit's hidden, but it still exists.\n\n322\n00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,120\nOther users can see it.\n\n323\n00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,200\nSo if we wanna get rid of it, you've\ngotta use that permanently delete link to\n\n324\n00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,980\nactually get rid of that calendar,\nand get it put back.\n\n325\n00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870\nAll right.\n\n326\n00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,720\nSo that's pretty much it for\ncreating a calendar.\n\n327\n00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,100\nAnd we've got some more things\nwe're gonna see in another segment.\n\n328\n00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,300\nBut in this segment,\nwe got to see creating a calendar,\n\n329\n00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,580\nmodifying the default sharing\nsettings on that calendar and\n\n330\n00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,610\nactually delegating authority for\nthe calendar out to other people so\n\n331\n00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,570\nthey can see events or\neven create and manage the events.\n\n332\n00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,360\nAnd finally we got a chance to see\nthat Shared Calendar for our office.\n\n333\n00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,140\nWe can put that in place and\ngive people access to it.\n\n334\n00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,610\nThese are all fundamental steps in\ngetting a calendaring system set up for\n\n335\n00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,810\na company especially in the early days.\n\n336\n00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:36,030\nGetting that collaborative effort put in\nplace is what Google Apps is all about.\n\n337\n00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,687\nWell stay tuned we've got more\nGoogle Apps episodes coming up.\n\n338\n00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:39,790\nI'll see you then.\n\n339\n00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:46,189\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Resources.\n\n4\n00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,570\nNow, what is a Calendar Resource?\n\n5\n00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,300\nWhen we create a Calendar, what we're\nnormally doing is we're scheduling\n\n6\n00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,050\nevents that we as a person\nneed to participate in.\n\n7\n00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,560\nBut often times there's objects,\nequipment, rooms,\n\n8\n00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,270\nfacilities, things like that,\nthat are associated with the events also.\n\n9\n00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,970\nFor example, if I'm gonna have a meeting,\n\n10\n00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,890\nI might invite five employees here\nfrom the company to this meeting.\n\n11\n00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,750\nI need all of them to get together.\n\n12\n00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,190\nBut where's the meeting going to be?\n\n13\n00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,380\nWell, I've got Aware Field in the event,\nI can plug it in there.\n\n14\n00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,680\nBut what if I scheduled two meetings\nin the same room, at the same time?\n\n15\n00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,360\nMaybe, I schedule a meeting\nwith our director, and\n\n16\n00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,530\nmeanwhile one of the other hosts\nschedules a meeting with our producer,\n\n17\n00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,270\nin the same room at the same time.\n\n18\n00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,680\nWe've double-booked.\n\n19\n00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,660\nSo, it's nice to be able\nto track our resources too.\n\n20\n00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,090\nWe see this really commonly\nwith conference rooms.\n\n21\n00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,450\nWhich you can avoid\ndouble-booking a conference room.\n\n22\n00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,521\nBut we also see it with equipment, things\nlike shared laptops, shared projectors, or\n\n23\n00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,950\nthings of that nature.\n\n24\n00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,570\nWe can use those as resources, so that\npeople can reserve them for certain times.\n\n25\n00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,090\nAny kind of object that you want to have\nreservations for, is a Calendar Resource.\n\n26\n00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,600\nNow, when you set up Google Apps,\nby default there are no resources.\n\n27\n00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,750\nYou don't even see the options for\nit, but it's all just kind of hidden.\n\n28\n00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,730\nWe need to go in and define\nthe resources that our organization has.\n\n29\n00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,080\nAnd then they'll become available for\nus to use.\n\n30\n00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720\nNow, one word of advice.\n\n31\n00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,560\nNow, I'm sure I'll run into it here,\nwhen I set it up.\n\n32\n00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,050\nWhen you set up your resource accounts,\nthey take a little while to synchronize,\n\n33\n00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,380\nand allow Google Calendar\nto see that they exist.\n\n34\n00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,530\nAnd the problem is that they're tied to\nthese use accounts that you're not built\n\n35\n00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,060\nfor, and that means they have to be\ncreated a slightly different way.\n\n36\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,330\nSo if you're in a hurry\nto get something setup,\n\n37\n00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,800\ndon't rely on Google Resources right away,\nor in your Calendar Resources right away.\n\n38\n00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,426\nBut if you're planning for this, and\nyou're setting your environment up,\n\n39\n00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,950\ndefinitely [INAUDIBLE]\nthere are great thing.\n\n40\n00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,710\nJust don't rush it,\nit won't work quite right.\n\n41\n00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,350\nAnd we'll see that here\ncuz I am going to rush it.\n\n42\n00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,550\nSo [LAUGH] let's say,\nI wanna create some resources.\n\n43\n00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,070\nWell I'll go into my Admin console,\nand into Google Apps.\n\n44\n00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,620\nAnd I'll go into Calendar.\n\n45\n00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,260\nAnd right here on my main Calendar page,\nI'm gonna see Resources.\n\n46\n00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,820\nAnd here's that chance for me to create\nall these different resources for\n\n47\n00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,910\nwhatever it is that we need.\n\n48\n00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,310\nAny kind of shared equipment.\n\n49\n00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,750\nSo, I'll go over here, and\nchoose to create a New rRsource,\n\n50\n00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,350\nand we really just need to give it one\npiece of information, which is a name.\n\n51\n00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,530\nBut, it's a good idea to give it a second\npiece of information, which is a type.\n\n52\n00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,510\nIt's like a category,\nan easy way to filter the resources.\n\n53\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,340\nIf you've just got two,\nor three resources,\n\n54\n00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,630\nyou probably won't mess with the type,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n55\n00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,530\nBut, if you've got hundreds of resources,\n\n56\n00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,181\nyour end-users will be able to\nuse the type to filter them out.\n\n57\n00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:00,012\nSo, I might have three conference rooms.\n\n58\n00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,405\nSo, I might have Room 201, and\n\n59\n00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:08,440\nI'm gonna set that with\na type of Conference Room.\n\n60\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,877\nSo that one's gonna be a Conference Room,\nand it's just Room 201.\n\n61\n00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,290\nSo I'll go ahead, and hit Save.\n\n62\n00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,790\nAnd I'll go ahead, and create another\nresource, and maybe this will be Room 108,\n\n63\n00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,410\nwhich will also be a Conference Room.\n\n64\n00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,090\nAnd then I'll go in, and\nadd some other room, Room 327,\n\n65\n00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,700\nwhich will be a Conference Room.\n\n66\n00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760\nAnd then I'll just go ahead,\nand add just one more.\n\n67\n00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,151\nI'm gonna add Projector 1.\n\n68\n00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:38,750\nWhich I will just classify as Equipments.\n\n69\n00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,630\nNow, if they don't show up right away,\ndon't sweat it.\n\n70\n00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,570\nJust give it a moment,\nit sometimes takes a moment to refresh.\n\n71\n00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,850\nBut there they go.\n\n72\n00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,430\nSo now, I've got my rooms.\n\n73\n00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,190\nAnd my projector right there.\n\n74\n00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,410\nSo Room 108, Room 327,\nRoom 201, and Projector 1,\n\n75\n00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,880\nand their Resource type right here.\n\n76\n00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,550\nSo now, that I've got those Resources,\nI'm ready to book them.\n\n77\n00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,380\nWell, not exactly.\n\n78\n00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,510\nThese resources that we just created.\n\n79\n00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,210\nThey're basically user accounts.\n\n80\n00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,080\nThey're user accounts that we don't see.\n\n81\n00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,890\nIf we go out here to our Users,\nand we look at our User list.\n\n82\n00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,270\nWe'll see all the users,\nand our employees.\n\n83\n00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,330\nBut we don't see those resource accounts,\ndo we?\n\n84\n00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,280\nThat's because they're special accounts,\nthey're hidden.\n\n85\n00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,190\nBut they've got a Calendar\nattached to each one of them.\n\n86\n00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,790\nAnd in order to use the Resource accounts.\n\n87\n00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,910\nWe have to share their Calendar, with\nanybody we want to be able to book them.\n\n88\n00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,110\nSo, if I want somebody to\nbe able to book Room 201,\n\n89\n00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,870\nI need to share Room\n201's Calendar with them.\n\n90\n00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,070\nI need to delegate out those privileges.\n\n91\n00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,080\nIf I don't do that,\nif I don't share it out,\n\n92\n00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,740\nwhen any user goes to book Room 201,\nit will show as always being busy.\n\n93\n00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,390\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week,\nit'll always show as busy.\n\n94\n00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,830\nSo if I stop right here,\nI kind of wasted my time.\n\n95\n00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,940\nThe resources exist, but\nonly I as a super-admin,\n\n96\n00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,830\nwill be able to schedule them.\n\n97\n00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,470\nSo my next step is gonna be\nto delegate permissions to\n\n98\n00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,080\nthose resources to allow other\npeople to schedule them.\n\n99\n00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,973\nAnd the way we do that is by enabling on\ntheir Calendar to allow other people to\n\n100\n00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,511\nsee the event details.\n\n101\n00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,191\nNot just see free busy data, but actually\nsee the event details on that resource.\n\n102\n00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,712\nSo, that's gonna be my next step.\n\n103\n00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:24,251\nI'm gonna jump over to Google Calendar,\nso I'm logged in here as my super-admin.\n\n104\n00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,578\nAnd I need to add the Calendars for\neach of those resources here, so\n\n105\n00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,830\nI can then go, and delegate them.\n\n106\n00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,383\nSo down here under Other Calendars,\nI'm gonna click that dropdown arrow, and\n\n107\n00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,200\nchoose Browse Interesting Calendars.\n\n108\n00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,360\nAnd hopefully,\nI've stalled enough that it shows up.\n\n109\n00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,130\nIt does take a minute to sync.\n\n110\n00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,078\nI'm gonna go to More, and\nI should see a new entry right there.\n\n111\n00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,353\nResources for itprotv.net.\n\n112\n00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,660\nThat's what I was hoping to see.\n\n113\n00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,160\nAnd notice, there's no subscribe button.\n\n114\n00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,300\nThat's because there's\nmore than one resource.\n\n115\n00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,706\nIf I click on that,\nit's gonna show me the resources, and\n\n116\n00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,290\nI just need to subscribe\nto each one of them.\n\n117\n00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,912\nSubscribing to them is\ngonna add them to my list.\n\n118\n00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:04,377\nAnd looks like I have a little\nproblem there with 108,\n\n119\n00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,770\nlet me just subscribe to the other one.\n\n120\n00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,180\nI might've clicked it too fast,\n\n121\n00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,280\nthere's a little loading blurb that pops\nup there in the top-right corner, and\n\n122\n00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,850\nif you click Subscribe while it's still up\nthere, it gets a little angry with you.\n\n123\n00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,170\nSo, let me try that one again.\n\n124\n00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,200\nThere we go.\n\n125\n00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,010\nSo, I'm subscribed to\neach of those objects.\n\n126\n00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,880\nIf I go back to my Calendar,\nI've now got Projector 1, Room 108, 201,\n\n127\n00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,300\n327, all, right there.\n\n128\n00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,110\nNow, I need to go, and\ndelegate out permissions.\n\n129\n00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,760\nOnce I've delegated permissions,\nI can remove these Calendars from my list.\n\n130\n00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,610\nI don't have to keep them attached,\nbut just to delegate them out,\n\n131\n00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,420\nI need to add them in like this.\n\n132\n00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,373\nSo I can go to one of these,\nso I'll go to this room, and\n\n133\n00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,380\nI can choose to Share this calendar.\n\n134\n00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,500\nAnd I'm gonna pick,\nwho I wanna share it with.\n\n135\n00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,730\nNotice the room, it got an email address.\n\n136\n00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,080\nIt is a user account.\n\n137\n00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,130\nIt's got an email address, just like any\nof us, and that's how it's being tracked.\n\n138\n00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,110\nIt just doesn't show up\nas a user in my system.\n\n139\n00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,790\nAnd right here I've got,\nShare this calendar with others.\n\n140\n00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,130\nAnd it sets the people can\nsee all the event details.\n\n141\n00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,080\nThat makes it seem like we're done.\n\n142\n00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,590\nBut you really got to share it with\nspecific people to get this to\n\n143\n00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,640\nwork properly.\n\n144\n00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,470\nSo, I'm gonna go down here, and\nI'll pick some other people.\n\n145\n00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,780\nAnd now, I don't have to put myself,\nIf I try, it'll get mad at me.\n\n146\n00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,580\nBut I do need to put other people so\nI'm gonna give access, so\n\n147\n00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,910\nI'll get him added, and you need to make\nsure they have see all event details.\n\n148\n00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,550\nYou can give them more, like make changes\nto event, and to make changes, and\n\n149\n00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,740\nmanage sharing.\n\n150\n00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,730\nThat will allow them to delegate\nout to other people too.\n\n151\n00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,210\nYou might want them to have that access,\n\n152\n00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,930\nyou can specify whatever\nit is you need right there.\n\n153\n00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,360\nAnd basically, we just go down the line,\nand do that for each of the resources.\n\n154\n00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,520\nEvery time you create a new resource,\nyou'll delegate it out.\n\n155\n00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,620\nOne trick I like to use,\n\n156\n00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,885\nif you want everybody to be able to\nreserve it, is you can create a group.\n\n157\n00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:54,225\nAnd I know we haven't filmed our segment\non groups yet, we'll do that soon.\n\n158\n00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:57,405\nBut you can create a group for\nall the employees.\n\n159\n00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,665\nAnd when you delegate out, just delegate\nit out to that all employees group.\n\n160\n00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:05,575\nAnd that way all employees now, and in the\nfuture when you hire them, will be added,\n\n161\n00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,685\nand will have access to be able\nto delegate out this resource,\n\n162\n00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,355\nor be able to assign it to an event.\n\n163\n00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,480\nNow, here's the part that may, or\n\n164\n00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,340\nmay not work right off,\nbecause I haven't given it enough time.\n\n165\n00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,620\nI've got an event here, like Don's event.\n\n166\n00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,330\nAnd Don's event does not\ncurrently have a Where.\n\n167\n00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,110\nIt doesn't have a location.\n\n168\n00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,470\nAnd it doesn't have any\nresources attached to it either.\n\n169\n00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,814\nSo, I don't know what room it's in,\nor projector, or so on.\n\n170\n00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:33,350\nOnce those resources have time to\nsynchronize, over here where I've got Add\n\n171\n00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,347\nguests, what you'll see is this\nwill actually turn into two tabs.\n\n172\n00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:40,333\nYou'll have a tab that says Add guests,\nand\n\n173\n00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:45,440\nyou'll have another tab that'll say Rooms,\ncomma, et cetera, or etc.\n\n174\n00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,380\nAnd you'll click on that rooms etc,\nand then you'll be able to search, and\n\n175\n00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,040\nfind your rooms.\n\n176\n00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,813\nNow, just because they\naren't showing up yet,\n\n177\n00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:54,770\nit doesn't mean that you can't use them.\n\n178\n00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,250\nYou could actually click\nhere on Add guests, and\n\n179\n00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,080\nif you start typing, there they are.\n\n180\n00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,870\nSo, I can see Room 201, 327, 108.\n\n181\n00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,780\nThey show up right here.\n\n182\n00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,740\nIt's just they haven't synchronized\nthe system to add that tab yet.\n\n183\n00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,450\nIt'll appear sometime\nin the next 24 hours.\n\n184\n00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,060\nBut I'll pick Room 201.\n\n185\n00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,270\nNow, it knows it's a room.\n\n186\n00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,380\nSee what it did?\n\n187\n00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,050\nIt just changed it to the Where.\n\n188\n00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,158\nBut look at that name.\n\n189\n00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,050\n[LAUGH] That's a serious name.\n\n190\n00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,760\nWhen it's properly\nsynchronized in the system,\n\n191\n00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,460\nthat'll actually show up as Room 201.\n\n192\n00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,510\nIt'll show up as the proper thing.\n\n193\n00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,660\nBut since, I'm forcing it along at\na faster rate than it's used to,\n\n194\n00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660\nthat's why it's showing up\nkind of strange like that.\n\n195\n00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,024\nSo now, I've got a room attached.\n\n196\n00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:37,189\nWhen you've got the rooms comma etc tab,\nyou can click it, and\n\n197\n00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,294\nyou can choose the projector, and so on.\n\n198\n00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:44,720\nAnd those will become Equipment Resources\nthat are attached to this meeting.\n\n199\n00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,450\nAnd now, when people get this invitation,\nwhen they see this meeting,\n\n200\n00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,750\nthey'll say oh this is in Room 201.\n\n201\n00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,160\nAnd if somebody else tries to\nbook Room 201 for this meeting,\n\n202\n00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,400\nor at the same time,\nit'll say that that one is busy.\n\n203\n00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760\nThat they won't be able to book it.\n\n204\n00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,140\nAnd they'll say, all right,\nlet me pick one of the other rooms.\n\n205\n00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,810\nI'll pick Room 327.\n\n206\n00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,480\nMaybe that one's available.\n\n207\n00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,080\nAnd they can pick, and choose based on\nthat, assuming they have that permission.\n\n208\n00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,690\nWe did the delegation.\n\n209\n00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,440\nIf not, those rooms will always show busy.\n\n210\n00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,770\nThey just wont be able to pick them.\n\n211\n00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,310\nSo, that's how the Resource accounts work.\n\n212\n00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,080\nThey're really cool, if you have any\nkind of shared, or managed resource.\n\n213\n00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,610\nThe only limitation, is that if you do\nsomething like share the permissions\n\n214\n00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,820\nout with your whole company,\nabsolutely, anybody can book the room.\n\n215\n00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,450\nSo, even the lowliest employee\n\n216\n00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,110\nversus the highest employee will\nhave the same amount of access.\n\n217\n00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,300\nIf me, as a IT guy,\nI can go and book room 201.\n\n218\n00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,960\nAnd then, the CEO wants to book Room 201.\n\n219\n00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,570\nWell, Google Apps doesn't know\nthe political structure of your company.\n\n220\n00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,840\nIt just knows that, I booked it first, and\n\n221\n00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,700\nthe CEO is coming second,\nCEO can't have access to that room.\n\n222\n00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,110\nSo, that's gonna make somebody mad.\n\n223\n00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,610\nSo as a super-admin,\nyou wanna make sure you keep that in mind.\n\n224\n00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,130\nThat you might need to go, and\noverride things from time to time, And\n\n225\n00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,250\nthat's where it is a good idea\nto keep this Calendar linked.\n\n226\n00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,360\nIf we keep the Calendar linked,\nwe'll have it right here.\n\n227\n00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,410\nAnd if I have a double-booking, I can go,\nand pick a room, like Room 201.\n\n228\n00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,380\nAnd when I go, and take a look at it,\nnotice in Room 201,\n\n229\n00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,580\nlet me change it's color to\nsomething really vibrant.\n\n230\n00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,030\nSee, how I've got Don's event here.\n\n231\n00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,910\nAnd Don's event is now twice.\n\n232\n00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,340\nDon's event was actually added to Rm 201.\n\n233\n00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,940\nSo, that's how I know what's booked there.\n\n234\n00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,790\nI could go, and remove Room 201 from it.\n\n235\n00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,100\nAnd now, the CEO would go and\nbe able to book that room.\n\n236\n00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200\nAnd I'd need to contact who ever had it,\nand say hey, guys I'm sorry.\n\n237\n00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840\nI've got to yank that room,\nwe need it for something else.\n\n238\n00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,620\nYou can book a different room.\n\n239\n00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,665\nAnd then they can go, and\nchoose based on that.\n\n240\n00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,830\nS,o Resources make that helpful.\n\n241\n00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,880\nThey really stop that\ndouble-booking of conference rooms.\n\n242\n00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,770\nAnd I didn't even do the equipment side,\nlike projectors, laptops,\n\n243\n00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,040\nother equipment that's there.\n\n244\n00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,850\nYou can have nice little reservations,\n\n245\n00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,390\nto ensure that people have\nequal access to the equipment.\n\n246\n00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,450\nSo in this segment, we got a chance to see\ncreating shared resources in Google Apps.\n\n247\n00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,410\nDelegating permissions out, so that people\nwill be able to assign them to events, and\n\n248\n00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,540\nthen actually assigning to an event,\nand getting in place.\n\n249\n00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,660\nIt's a neat function.\n\n250\n00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,200\nIt's one that a lot of people overlook,\nand don't use, but\n\n251\n00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,070\nit is really cool, definitely something\nyou can take advantage of, and\n\n252\n00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,850\nI only brushed the tip\nof the iceberg here.\n\n253\n00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,780\nYou can track things like company cars,\nand other resources like that,\n\n254\n00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,460\nthat aren't even related to a meeting, but\npeople need to book for certain times.\n\n255\n00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,020\nThere's a ton of power there, so\nit's a neat feature to play around with.\n\n256\n00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,970\nI hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n257\n00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,850\nStay tuned,\nmore of Google Apps is coming up next.\n\n258\n00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,169\n[SOUND]\n\n",

devices that are connected\nto your Google Apps account.\n\n4\n00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,522\nNow when we talk about Android and\n\n5\n00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,390\nGoogle Sync, what we're really\ntalking about are mobile devices and\n\n6\n00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,174\nthese might be tablets or cellphones,\nthey could be Chromebooks.\n\n7\n00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:23,566\nVarious things like that,\n\n8\n00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:28,210\nthat are using your Google Apps accounts\nto connect to your Google Apps services.\n\n9\n00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,001\nIf one of these devices gets lost or\nstolen or has data on it that gets leaked\n\n10\n00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,034\nout, that's a problem and we need a way\nto be able to manage and control that and\n\n11\n00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,606\nwe've got full functionality for\nthat right inside of Google Apps.\n\n12\n00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,020\nNow, I find that this is one of\nthe most misunderstood features.\n\n13\n00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,418\nA lot of people assume that this\ndevice management is on by default and\n\n14\n00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:50,638\nthey'll have their end users connecting up\ntheir Google accounts to their phones and\n\n15\n00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:54,522\nthen they'll come in and they'll find\nthat they're not able to manage them.\n\n16\n00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,840\nThe reason is in order to\ntruly manage the device,\n\n17\n00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,083\nthere's a couple of extra\nsteps we need to take.\n\n18\n00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,420\nSo we're gonna get a chance to see that.\n\n19\n00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,790\nIt's not uncommon to take a Google Apps\naccount like this one and go under device\n\n20\n00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,780\nmanagement and inside device\nmanagement to go to managed devices and\n\n21\n00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,870\nnot see anything, even though you know for\na fact that some of your end users\n\n22\n00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,859\nare using their cellphone to\naccess their Google account.\n\n23\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,846\nThe reason is we need to connect one\nof two ways not just for email and\n\n24\n00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:29,497\ncalendaring, but for actual MDM,\nMobile Device Management.\n\n25\n00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:34,443\nWhen you log in to email,\nyou can log in with IMAP or POP3.\n\n26\n00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:37,473\nWhen you connect to Google Calender,\nyou can connect directly to it.\n\n27\n00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,699\nThat doesn't give us the ability\nto remotely erase a device.\n\n28\n00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:44,814\nBelieve it or not, they didn't build\nthat into the calendar protocol and\n\n29\n00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,620\nIMAP definitely didn't have it.\n\n30\n00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,490\nSo a lot of the protocols we use for\ncommunications,\n\n31\n00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,280\ndon't provide that support and that's why\nthe devices don't show up right here,\n\n32\n00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200\ncuz it's not built into those protocols.\n\n33\n00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,723\nThe old way to do this,\n\n34\n00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:01,813\nto get the connectivity in place was\nto use a technology from Microsoft.\n\n35\n00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:04,240\nMicrosoft had a technology\ncalled ActiveSync.\n\n36\n00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,281\nAnd when a device used ActiveSync,\n\n37\n00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:11,315\nActiveSync would give them access to their\nemail, to their calendar, to their notes,\n\n38\n00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:16,008\nto all those various things and it would\nalso hook up the administration console,\n\n39\n00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,618\nso that we could block and\nerase the devices.\n\n40\n00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:21,637\nAll the little buttons up here\nwould light up, if we had that.\n\n41\n00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:25,282\nWell, the problem it was\nMicrosoft technology.\n\n42\n00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:28,455\nSo Google, instead of reinventing\nthe wheel on the beginning,\n\n43\n00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,819\njust licensed the technology\nfrom Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,416\nThey called it Google Sync, but it really\nis Microsoft ActiveSync under the hood.\n\n45\n00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,860\nSo when we go to configure\ndevice management,\n\n46\n00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,501\nwe'll see settings that\npertain to Google Sync.\n\n47\n00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:46,627\nAnd the official exam for this one,\nif you look is demonstrate how to use\n\n48\n00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:52,020\nGoogle Apps Mobile Management to manage\nAndroid and Google Sync devices.\n\n49\n00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,968\nAnd a Google Sync device is really any\ndevice that can run Microsoft Activesync\n\n50\n00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:03,569\nand that's going to be iOS, iPhones and\niPads can do it, Windows Phone.\n\n51\n00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,057\nSo if you have a Windows mobile phone,\neven the really old ones like\n\n52\n00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:11,315\nWindows Phone 6, they can do it and\nBlackBerries, BlackBerry 10 and above.\n\n53\n00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:12,198\nThey can do it.\n\n54\n00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:13,827\nAnd you don't have to know it for\nthe exam,\n\n55\n00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,970\nthey're not going to give you\na mobile device to setup.\n\n56\n00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,375\nBut in the show notes for this episode,\nI'll include links to how to\n\n57\n00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,099\nconfigure each one of those,\nif you're actually setting up the device.\n\n58\n00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,164\nBut basically, you just run through\ntheir little ActiveSync wizard.\n\n59\n00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,469\nYou specify your server,\nwhich is your Google Apps connection and\n\n60\n00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,608\nthey put in their user name and\npassword and it sets the rest up.\n\n61\n00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:36,104\nThey'll have email,\ncalendaring, notes, tasks,\n\n62\n00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:38,536\nall that stuff will synchronize up and\n\n63\n00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:44,021\nthey'll now show up in our manage devices\nscreen, so we'll be able to control them.\n\n64\n00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,548\nBut Google Sync is built on\ntop of Microsoft ActiveSync,\n\n65\n00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,245\nit's a licensed feature.\n\n66\n00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:53,679\nAnd obviously, Google doesn't want you\nto keep using that if there's something\n\n67\n00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:57,291\nbetter and the something better\nis the native Google Apps client.\n\n68\n00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,867\nMany operating systems today,\nactually have native support for\n\n69\n00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,240\nGoogle Apps built-in.\n\n70\n00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,748\nAndroid, obviously has it.\n\n71\n00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:08,446\nAs Google's flagship OS, you can expect\nit to be there, but even iOS and\n\n72\n00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:12,154\nsome other phones are starting\nto have it built-in too.\n\n73\n00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,245\nSo we don't necessarily\nneed Google Sync anymore,\n\n74\n00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:18,064\nif we can make use of\na native Google connector.\n\n75\n00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:21,908\nYou can see this on like an iOS\ndevice when you go to add an account.\n\n76\n00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,727\nAnd actually, I think one of those\nURLs I've got here shows it.\n\n77\n00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:29,232\nLet me pull this one up and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n78\n00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:33,110\nWhen we go to add a device\nlike a iOS device, so\n\n79\n00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,385\nthey kinda show the step by step here.\n\n80\n00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:39,193\nSee, how they're going into\nmail contacts and calendars.\n\n81\n00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:43,293\nThey're going into Add Accounts and\nthey're choosing Microsoft Exchange.\n\n82\n00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:46,403\nWhy are they choosing Microsoft Exchange,\nif they're connecting to Google?\n\n83\n00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,412\nWell, Microsoft Exchange uses ActiveSync.\n\n84\n00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:54,090\nAnd so they're really saying, I wanna use\nActiveSync to connect up to Google Apps.\n\n85\n00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,349\nAnd instead of specifying\nan exchange server,\n\n86\n00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,777\nthey'll specify the Google Apps\nserver to do it and\n\n87\n00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:02,057\nActiveSync will give us the ability\nto manage that device remotely.\n\n88\n00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:07,014\nBut you'll see, you don't actually\nhave to do it, beneath it is Google.\n\n89\n00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,185\nI could choose Google, won't that do it?\n\n90\n00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,357\nAnd sadly, the answer is no.\n\n91\n00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:12,005\nNo, it won't.\n\n92\n00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:16,997\nWhen you choose Google right there, it's\nactually setting up an IMAP connection and\n\n93\n00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:20,672\nit's not doing a true remotely\nmanaged system or connection,\n\n94\n00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,776\nat least not in this version of iOS.\n\n95\n00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:23,982\nThis is iOS 6 here.\n\n96\n00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:26,854\nBut in newer versions of iOS,\nlike iOS 7 and 8,\n\n97\n00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:30,711\nthat Google option does include\nthe mobile device management and\n\n98\n00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:34,168\nit will show up in the list and\nyou can remote wipe and so on.\n\n99\n00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:38,337\nOn older Android phones that didn't have\nit, you can actually go in the App Store\n\n100\n00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:41,854\nand get it, the Google Device\nManagement App, you'd install it.\n\n101\n00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:45,772\nAnd that's what would connect the remote\nwipe and other information, so\n\n102\n00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:49,813\nthat extra step to get the Google native\nclient on there to be able to manage it\n\n103\n00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:50,845\nwith Google apps.\n\n104\n00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:53,307\nSo, it's kind of important.\n\n105\n00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:58,737\nOnce we got that set on our client though,\nthe client will connect up and we'll\n\n106\n00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:04,186\nsee it right here in this list and I'll\njust show you guys a quick example here.\n\n107\n00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:08,145\nLike here is some of my old phones\nconnected to an account and so\n\n108\n00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:10,897\nI've got my Asus PadFone X and Galaxy S3.\n\n109\n00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:12,453\nApparently, I've got two of them.\n\n110\n00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,392\nI can see the devices here in the list.\n\n111\n00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,740\nI've got them connected\nnot with Google Sync,\n\n112\n00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,036\nI'm using the native\nGoogle client on those.\n\n113\n00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:22,855\nThey're connected, I can see them, I see\nthe device IDs and I can manage them,\n\n114\n00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,363\nbecause they're now\nconsidered a managed device.\n\n115\n00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:31,408\nNow the mobile device management piece of\nGoogle Apps is super easy to configure,\n\n116\n00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,955\nmostly because it's already on.\n\n117\n00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,056\nIt's turned on, we don't have to tweak it.\n\n118\n00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:37,694\nWe just need to connect the device.\n\n119\n00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:40,097\nSo connecting the device is\nreally the challenging part.\n\n120\n00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:43,336\nWe just need to make sure we use\nthe right settings and get that in place.\n\n121\n00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,610\nBut on the server, there are a few\nthings that you can adjust.\n\n122\n00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,238\nYou'll see the device\nmanagement settings and\n\n123\n00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:53,715\nthis is where we set our default policies\nand there's a lot of good stuff in here.\n\n124\n00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:57,117\nThings like,\nwhether we even want to allow Google Sync.\n\n125\n00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,891\nYou can choose to block that and\njust allow the native sync or\n\n126\n00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,153\nyou can choose to leave it on and\nhave it available.\n\n127\n00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:07,973\nYou'll see Android has a native client and\niOS has native clients.\n\n128\n00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,412\nSo those are turned on by default.\n\n129\n00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,365\nI didn't have to turn these on,\nthey're already on,\n\n130\n00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,755\nthen you can see some\nof the other settings.\n\n131\n00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:16,914\nDo you want to allow Google Glass?\n\n132\n00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:17,611\nMaybe you don't.\n\n133\n00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,815\nYou've got the option to turn it on or\noff and then your password settings.\n\n134\n00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,371\nThese are great.\n\n135\n00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,795\nMany, many people don't bother\nsetting a pin number on their phone.\n\n136\n00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,734\nAnd that means if anybody\nfinds their phone,\n\n137\n00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:31,322\nthey'll have access to that person's email\naccount and that's not a good thing.\n\n138\n00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:34,097\nSo here,\nyou can set to require a password.\n\n139\n00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:37,604\nHow many chances they can get to\nenter it in before the phone locks.\n\n140\n00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,065\nHow often we require them to change it.\n\n141\n00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:43,742\nYou'll see other device settings,\nlike whether we can force encryption,\n\n142\n00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,810\nwhether we allow them to use their camera,\n\n143\n00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,866\nwe can turn that camera functionality\noff and other settings.\n\n144\n00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,782\nA lot of good stuff to be found in here.\n\n145\n00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:53,998\nYou will see notes throughout though, but\n\n146\n00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:57,399\nsome of these will say,\nonly applies to iOS.\n\n147\n00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,001\nSo, it doesn't apply to an Android phone.\n\n148\n00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:04,163\nOr other ones, like this one here\nis an Android setting, but it says,\n\n149\n00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:05,445\nalso applies to iOS.\n\n150\n00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,582\nSo, it applies to both Android and iOS.\n\n151\n00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:11,535\nSo just be aware that not every setting\nis supported on every device and\n\n152\n00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,746\nit'll always tell you which is which.\n\n153\n00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:17,635\nNow you can browse through, there's a lot\nof neat stuff in here that's useful.\n\n154\n00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:20,758\nI like this one,\nAdd a Server Certificate Authority.\n\n155\n00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:25,266\nIf you have your own private CA, if you\nhave your own public key infrastructure,\n\n156\n00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,910\nyou can take the root cert of that CA and\npush it out to the phones and\n\n157\n00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,925\nnow they'll trust\nthe certificates that you issue.\n\n158\n00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:35,650\nThat's super handy for a lot of this\ntechnology, cuz it's using SSL under\n\n159\n00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,490\nthe hood to encrypt its data and you don't\nnecessarily wanna have to go out and\n\n160\n00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,292\nbuy public certificates for all this\nstuff when you can just issue your own.\n\n161\n00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,949\nThese are all different things that\ncompanies have to think about when they\n\n162\n00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,122\nsetup mobile devices.\n\n163\n00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:53,381\nIt is a dangerous area, cuz it's so easy\nto lose these devices to misplace them.\n\n164\n00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,796\nAnd now basically, a gateway into your\ncorporate network is released into\n\n165\n00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,919\nthe wild and\nyou definitely don't want that.\n\n166\n00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,733\nBut the use of the general\npolicy settings,\n\n167\n00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:06,687\nif your clients are not running Google\nSync or the native Google Apps client.\n\n168\n00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,392\nIf they're not running it,\nthese settings do doing anything.\n\n169\n00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:10,971\nYou're wasting your time setting these.\n\n170\n00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:14,408\nFor devices that are managed,\nthe ones that show up on your list,\n\n171\n00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:15,664\nthese can be enforced.\n\n172\n00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:19,845\nAnd you'll see that option right here\nto enforce the policies to ensure that\n\n173\n00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:22,606\nthey take effect on those\ndevices no matter what.\n\n174\n00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,894\nThey're going to take effect and\nbe on there.\n\n175\n00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:30,363\nOnce we get everything set the way we\nwant, we go ahead and save our changes.\n\n176\n00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:35,296\nAnd now the next time that phone checks\nin, it'll receive this new policy.\n\n177\n00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,407\nPhones do not get this instantaneously.\n\n178\n00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,927\nThe reason is we don't want\nto consume their battery.\n\n179\n00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,923\nIt takes battery power to go and check in.\n\n180\n00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:47,178\nThe phones check in periodically,\nI believe it's every 90 minutes for\n\n181\n00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:47,940\nthe policy.\n\n182\n00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,621\nLet me see if it' s got it in here.\n\n183\n00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,153\nI don't see the setting,\nbut it's in here somewhere.\n\n184\n00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:56,261\nI believe it's every 90 minutes they\ncheck to see if the policy is updated\n\n185\n00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:56,865\nand refresh.\n\n186\n00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:01,117\nEmail is checked way more frequently, but\nthe policy is just check less frequently,\n\n187\n00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,436\ncuz it's not something\nwe modify very often.\n\n188\n00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,859\nBut basically, you set your setting,\nyou define it and it's in place.\n\n189\n00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:11,455\nLike I said, when I post the show notes,\nI'll make sure to include\n\n190\n00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:15,777\nthese links to each of the different OSes,\niOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry.\n\n191\n00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,288\nFor Android, you've got that client,\n\n192\n00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,786\nyou can just download it right out\nof the App Store and it's got it.\n\n193\n00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,458\nFor iOS, you don't even need the client\nanymore and this article shows ActiveSync,\n\n194\n00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,549\nwhich you don't really\neven need that anymore,\n\n195\n00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:28,610\nyou can just go through the regular\nsetup and that'll have it added in.\n\n196\n00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,733\nSo couple a neat things that are there and\n\n197\n00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,928\nthat's basically mobile device\nmanagement not much to it.\n\n198\n00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:38,374\nIt is popular enough that all\nof this is turned on by default.\n\n199\n00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:43,092\nSo when you have a brand new Google Apps\naccount, when you go into your system,\n\n200\n00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,895\nyou'll have device management\nright there and so, it's on.\n\n201\n00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,148\nIt's turned on,\nyou can turn it off if you don't want it.\n\n202\n00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,470\nBut otherwise, it's there and\nit's in place.\n\n203\n00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,585\nOne quick note.\n\n204\n00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,276\nIf you're gonna use\nthe Apple iOS Sync piece,\n\n205\n00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,250\nyou do need to setup a push\ncertificate with Apple.\n\n206\n00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,295\nThe Apple phones, they won't check in for\ntheir policies with Google,\n\n207\n00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,032\nthey'll check in with Apple.\n\n208\n00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:07,040\nSo they'll reach out to Apple first and\nthen we have to tell Google to check in\n\n209\n00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,930\nwith Apple too and\nthey both meet in the middle.\n\n210\n00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,570\nApple is like the middleman and\nthat doesn't work,\n\n211\n00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,795\nunless you have an Apple Push certificate.\n\n212\n00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,501\nSo there's a little wizard,\nyou can run through.\n\n213\n00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,799\nIf you're supporting those iOS devices,\nyou'll want to do that.\n\n214\n00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,556\nThis is just a demo account for me,\nso I'm not gonna set it up here, but\n\n215\n00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,360\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n216\n00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,182\nYou just walk through a little wizard and\nit's done.\n\n217\n00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:29,832\nSo in this episode, we talked a little\nbit about mobile device management,\n\n218\n00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,954\nsome of the things we\nneeded to think about.\n\n219\n00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:35,648\nAnd we took a look at the policy settings\nin there, all sorts of really good\n\n220\n00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:39,175\nsettings to help manage our devices and\nkeep our network more secure.\n\n221\n00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:42,387\nNow, if you're asking yourself, gosh,\ndarn, you didn't show us to erase a phone,\n\n222\n00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:43,448\nthat's the awesome stuff.\n\n223\n00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:46,826\nWell, I know,\n[LAUGH] it's gonna be in the next segment.\n\n224\n00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:51,553\nSo stay tuned, we've got more\nGoogle Apps coming up after this.\n\n225\n00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:58,252\n[SOUND]\n\n",

full title is, Demonstrate How to\nReset User Access and Prevent Access From\n\n4\n00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,870\na Lost Mobile Device Blocking, remote\npeople from being able to get in our data.\n\n5\n00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,430\nCellphones and Ipads and\nAndroid tablets and so on, they've got so\n\n6\n00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,090\nmuch of our personal and corporate data on\nthem, that if you leave them in a cab, or\n\n7\n00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,780\nyou leave them on the bus,\nit's a big deal.\n\n8\n00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,190\nYour entire email account\nis accessible on there so\n\n9\n00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,140\nat a minimum that's what you're giving up.\n\n10\n00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,010\nBut you may be logged into other things,\nlike Facebook and Twitter.\n\n11\n00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,220\nI know a great example,\nI use a product called Hootsuite, and\n\n12\n00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,580\nHootsuite lets me post to our\nITPro.TV Twitter page, and Facebook.\n\n13\n00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,520\nI hate Facebook, so\nI never log in to it, and so\n\n14\n00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,420\nI told the guys, if you want me to\npost anything, you've got to give me\n\n15\n00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,890\nsomething other than FaceBook to use and\nso they gave me Hootsuite.\n\n16\n00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,120\nAnd so I'll log into that thing and post\nand it goes out to the different areas.\n\n17\n00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,670\nIf I were to lose my cell phone and\n\n18\n00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,430\nsomeone got ahold of it, they could start\nposting to the ITPro.TV FaceBook page.\n\n19\n00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,870\nThat would be awesome, wouldn't it?\n\n20\n00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,650\nSo, these are the kind of things\nthat we put ourselves at risk by\n\n21\n00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,400\nhaving these smart devices that have so\nmuch functionality.\n\n22\n00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,650\nSo when a device gets lost,\nwe need a way to reel that back in.\n\n23\n00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,750\nAnd one of the best ways to do\nthat is through an MDM solution,\n\n24\n00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,840\na mobile device management solution.\n\n25\n00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,160\nAnd there's a ton of vendors\nout there that do it, but\n\n26\n00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,560\nfortunately Google Apps\nhas it all built in, so\n\n27\n00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000\nyou shouldn't need any third-party\nsystems to make this happen.\n\n28\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,120\nWe covered in another segment how to get\nour devices connected into Google Apps for\n\n29\n00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,540\ndevice management.\n\n30\n00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,160\nOnce they're connected in,\npeople just run.\n\n31\n00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,470\nThey run and that's it, there's nothing\ntoo exciting there, but the moment\n\n32\n00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,730\na device is lost, the moment that the\nrecognize it's gone, they can reach out to\n\n33\n00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,080\nus as an administrator and say hey I lost\nmy device, can you do something about it.\n\n34\n00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,570\nAnd we can reach out and\nstart to take action.\n\n35\n00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,000\nMaybe they've got software on there like\nthe Google Locator, where they can go and\n\n36\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,150\nfind their device and figure out\nwhere it went, or find my iPhone.\n\n37\n00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,100\nBut barring that, if it's just gone,\nwe need to at a minimum,\n\n38\n00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,860\nprevent that phone from being\nable to access our network again.\n\n39\n00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,710\nAnd so we've got a few choices.\n\n40\n00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,850\nWhen we go into our admin console,\nyou can go to device management.\n\n41\n00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,850\nAnd inside of device management,\nyou'll see managed devices right there.\n\n42\n00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,530\nAnd that's gonna pull up the list\nof devices that your system is\n\n43\n00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,580\ncurrently managed.\n\n44\n00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,440\nI'm in my demo account.\n\n45\n00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,450\nLet me switch over to an active account.\n\n46\n00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,270\nHere we go.\n\n47\n00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,990\nSo here I've go a list of mobile phones\nthat are attached to my account.\n\n48\n00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,700\nSo I can see some of these different\nphones, an Asus phone, and\n\n49\n00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,890\na couple of Samsung phones right there.\n\n50\n00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,840\nIf I've lost one of those phones,\nlike maybe I lost my pad phone, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,780\nWell, I can take action.\n\n52\n00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,630\nMany systems out there\njust have one action,\n\n53\n00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,880\nwhich is to remote wipe the phone,\nso I certainly could do that.\n\n54\n00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,660\nI could check off the device and\nthen up here I can hit, remote wipe.\n\n55\n00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,250\nWhen I remote wipe, that's going to erase\nthe phone and all of the data on it.\n\n56\n00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,580\nAll right?\nSo it's gonna be empty and blank, so\n\n57\n00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,790\nwhoever has the phone, sure they can\ngo sell it on Ebay or whatever, but\n\n58\n00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,920\nat least they don't have my data.\n\n59\n00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,550\nThey can't get connected to\nmy corporate environment.\n\n60\n00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,860\nThey don't have access to my email,\nit's on, it's erased.\n\n61\n00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,960\nBut what if I don't think it was stolen?\n\n62\n00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,990\nWhat if it's just in my house\nsomewhere and I can't find it so,\n\n63\n00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,100\nI reach out the IT guys and I'm like\nlook I'll probably find it tonight.\n\n64\n00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,350\nI just don't know where my phone is.\n\n65\n00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,050\nIn that situation we might want to\nsomething just a little less drastic.\n\n66\n00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,890\nRight?\nNot erase the phone, but\n\n67\n00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,940\ntake some other type of\naction to protect us.\n\n68\n00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,180\nAnd for that we have two other choices,\nwe've got block and wipe account.\n\n69\n00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,160\nOkay, block is one of the least invasive.\n\n70\n00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,620\nBlock says leave the phone alone,\nbut don't let it connect anymore.\n\n71\n00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,860\nDon't let it connect to our\nGoogle Apps environment.\n\n72\n00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,380\nSo any emails or calendar items or\nwhatever that are cached on that phone,\n\n73\n00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,370\nyeah whoever has the phone can\nget at that, the data's there.\n\n74\n00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,710\nBut they won't be able to\nconnect up to send email or\n\n75\n00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,880\nreceive new emails or\ncreate calendar items.\n\n76\n00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,650\nThey won't be able to do that stuff\nbecause they're being blocked, or\n\n77\n00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,100\nprohibited, from accessing\nthe environment, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,280\nWipe account, what it does is\ninstead of wiping the whole phone,\n\n79\n00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,140\nit just removes the Google Apps account.\n\n80\n00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,890\nIt'll knock out that Google Apps account\nwhich is your email, your calendar,\n\n81\n00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,900\nyour tasks.\n\n82\n00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,800\nThat stuff gets wiped out.\n\n83\n00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,450\nBut it leaves all your apps,\nyour photos, your music.\n\n84\n00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,080\nThe other things that somebody\nmight have copied to that phone.\n\n85\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,860\nThat way you don't lose your personal\nphotos, or other things that might be\n\n86\n00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,360\nthere, and you just turn around and\nfind the phone the next day.\n\n87\n00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,980\nAll right.\n\n88\n00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,470\nSo those are kind of like a middle ground.\n\n89\n00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,220\nBlock doesn't remove\nanything from the phone.\n\n90\n00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,370\nIt just stops it from connecting.\n\n91\n00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,470\nWipe account removes the account data from\nthe phone and leaves everything else.\n\n92\n00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,860\nRemote wipe wipes the whole phone,\nerases everything.\n\n93\n00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,370\nNow all three of these\nare really dependent\n\n94\n00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,900\nupon the phone reconnecting again.\n\n95\n00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,800\nIf the phone is out there in the wild and\nwhoever got it actually stole it and\n\n96\n00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,480\nquick turned the wireless off or\nyanked the battery out of it.\n\n97\n00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,760\nMy remote wipe or my wipe account\nare never gonna make it to the phone.\n\n98\n00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,990\nIt would have to come online and\nhave a network signal again.\n\n99\n00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,370\nSo I lost this in my backyard and\nthe battery died.\n\n100\n00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,350\nWell it's never gonna phone back in.\n\n101\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,600\nSo it's never gonna check.\n\n102\n00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,690\nBut is somebody finds it,\ncharges it up and turns it on,\n\n103\n00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,790\nthe instant it checks in,\nit'll do the remote wipe.\n\n104\n00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,450\nSo even if the phone has a dead battery,\n\n105\n00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,550\nit's still a good idea\nto send the remote wipe.\n\n106\n00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,710\nThat way, whenever it is powered on,\nit'll get erased.\n\n107\n00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,560\nOdds are whoever stole it wasn't\ntargeting your data anyway.\n\n108\n00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,110\nAnd they're just gonna wipe it\nthemselves so they can sell it.\n\n109\n00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,650\nRight?\n\n110\n00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,840\nBut if it was malicious.\n\n111\n00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,450\nIf they're actually after your data,\n\n112\n00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,290\nwhen they bring it online that\nremote wipe will be waiting for it.\n\n113\n00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,039\nAnd it'll clear it out.\n\n114\n00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,520\nSo if I take my pad phone here and\nI go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,200\ndo a remote wipe,\nit's gonna say, are you sure?\n\n116\n00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,560\nWe're gonna send this remote wipe and\nit's gonna erase the entire phone.\n\n117\n00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,540\nNotice that it says it'll erase any apps\nas well as any data on external storage,\n\n118\n00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,850\nsuch as SD cards.\n\n119\n00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,310\nSo if I have an SD card in that device\nit's going to erase that too, so I need to\n\n120\n00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,760\nmake sure that that's what I want and\nif it is, I can go in and wipe device.\n\n121\n00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,110\nAnd then it's gonna reach out\nto that device and wipe it.\n\n122\n00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,290\nNow, it's sent the wipe at this point.\n\n123\n00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,760\nBut the device, notice here,\nit hasn't synced since 8/23.\n\n124\n00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,660\nIt's been over a month since\nthat device has synced in.\n\n125\n00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,560\nAll right, it's cuz it's sitting\nin a box at my office at home.\n\n126\n00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,750\nSo, it's just sitting there dead.\n\n127\n00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,090\nBut if I were to go and\npower it on the next time it synced,\n\n128\n00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,410\nthe next time it connected in,\nit would wipe.\n\n129\n00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,960\nAnd you'll get an email confirmation that\nlet's you know that the wipe happened,\n\n130\n00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,300\nbecause otherwise you don't really\nknow that it wiped or didn't.\n\n131\n00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,780\nBut the wipe is in there, and\n\n132\n00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,500\nyou'll see as long as the wipe is in\nplace I've got a cancel wipe button.\n\n133\n00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,690\nSo if it hasn't actually wiped yet.\n\n134\n00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,760\nI can cancel it so maybe they find the\nphone, whoever lost it comes in and says,\n\n135\n00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920\noh I found it.\n\n136\n00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600\nYou can go ahead and\n\n137\n00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,296\ncancel it before they turn it back on so\nit doesn't lose the data.\n\n138\n00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:02,840\nAnd when you cancel it you'll see\nwhere you can switch it to block, or\n\n139\n00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,890\nyou can put it back to approve.\n\n140\n00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,758\nSo I'll cancel that wipe and\nput it back to approve, and\n\n141\n00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:11,250\nnow it's an active phone that's up and\nvalid running on my system.\n\n142\n00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,160\nKind of a nice little feature,\n\n143\n00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,600\nand you'll see my resolution is low enough\nthat I couldn't see the status here.\n\n144\n00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,930\nAll of them are showing as approved.\n\n145\n00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,660\nIf I do a remote wipe on that phone again.\n\n146\n00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,850\nSo now I'm remote wiping my pad phone.\n\n147\n00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,040\nWhen I go over here,\nyou'll see the status says, wiping.\n\n148\n00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,630\nWhen it actually does wipe,\nit'll change it to say wiped, so\n\n149\n00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,280\nthat you'll know that it's\nactually been wiped out.\n\n150\n00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,420\nBut we can just cancel that, I'll move\nit back to, oh well here I'll move it to\n\n151\n00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,860\nblock this time, and now that status\nwill reflect the new blocked status.\n\n152\n00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,770\nSo, easy enough to change that stuff,\nyou can modify it however you want, and\n\n153\n00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,840\nI can always come back and approve it\nagain if the phone has been found.\n\n154\n00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,620\nAll right.\n\n155\n00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,550\nPretty neat stuff there.\n\n156\n00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,150\nNow, by default, we as an administrator\nhad to do this, right.\n\n157\n00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,060\nSo if an end user loses their phone they\nhave to contact an administrator and\n\n158\n00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,120\ngo in and do it.\n\n159\n00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,090\nBut you can make it for\nthe end user can wipe their own device.\n\n160\n00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,410\nThey would just log into\nthe admin console like we did.\n\n161\n00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,180\nNow when a regular user logs into\nthe admin console they see something\n\n162\n00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,820\nvery different than us, right.\n\n163\n00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,850\nThey see,\nthat basically links to their Gmail, and\n\n164\n00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,160\nlinks to their calendar, and so on.\n\n165\n00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,660\nThey don't see all\nthe management stuff that we do.\n\n166\n00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,350\nBut if we turn on their ability to remote\nwipe, they'll see mobile devices, and\n\n167\n00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,340\nthey'll be able to go in and wipe things.\n\n168\n00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,170\nIf you wanna turn that on,\nit's kinda buried away.\n\n169\n00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,780\nI'm gonna go back to my device\nmanagement screen, right here,\n\n170\n00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,270\nand if we go to device management\nsettings, and in here,\n\n171\n00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,440\nif we go down to the advanced settings\nportion right here, you'll see,\n\n172\n00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,810\nallow user to remote wipe device.\n\n173\n00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,130\nAnd you can check that, and when that's\nturned on, now your users can browse\n\n174\n00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,690\nthat main admin panel and, in addition to\nseeing links to their Gmail and calendar\n\n175\n00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,720\nand stuff, they'll be able to manage their\nremote devices, and choose to wipe them.\n\n176\n00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,900\nThat's nice if you want to\ngive them the power, so\n\n177\n00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,500\nthey don't have to reach out to\nthe help desk or whatever, to do it.\n\n178\n00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,760\nSo keep in mind that\nthat feature is there.\n\n179\n00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,040\nAll right.\nSo, in this segment,\n\n180\n00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,200\nwe got a chance to see the mobile\ndevice management in action.\n\n181\n00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,000\nHow we can remote wipe, block, or wipe\nan account from a device that has been\n\n182\n00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,240\nlost or\nstolen to protect our end user data.\n\n183\n00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,590\nVery important because losing\nthese devices is so easy.\n\n184\n00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,340\nThey're so small and\nthey're great targets for thieves.\n\n185\n00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,160\nSo you do see a lot of people reaching\nout specifically to get those.\n\n186\n00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,120\nAlright well I hope you\nguys enjoyed this segment.\n\n187\n00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,620\nStay tuned.\n\n188\n00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,458\nWe've got more Google Apps coming up next.\n\n189\n00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:40,149\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:08,264\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:11,336\nObjective 7.1 covers using\ngroups to manage security\n\n3\n00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:15,240\nsettings within your organization and\nwhen you hear that description,\n\n4\n00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,720\nyou kind of think to yourself, well we've\nalready got where we can manage security\n\n5\n00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,419\nsettings by our organization and\nour sub-orgs.\n\n6\n00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,770\nRight, so isn't that enough?\n\n7\n00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,360\nWell, there are some little\nexceptions to how we handle that.\n\n8\n00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,605\nOne of the big problems we have with using\nour sub-organizations to manage security\n\n9\n00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:36,705\nis that a user can only\nbe in one organization.\n\n10\n00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,095\nSo if I have them in one sub-org, I can't\nhave them simultaneously be in some\n\n11\n00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:44,375\nother sub-org to get additional\npermissions or whatever.\n\n12\n00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,485\nSo there are some scenarios where we can\nuse groups to start to influence that.\n\n13\n00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:53,530\nNow, we'll cover groups in\na dedicated episode here in a bit but\n\n14\n00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,740\nfor right now I want to show\nhow we can use groups within\n\n15\n00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,270\na sub-org to kind of tailor\npermissions that apply.\n\n16\n00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,860\nAnd this is a fairly new feature to Google\napps and so it's not very wide spread yet.\n\n17\n00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,570\nIn fact, there's really only one\nexample that we can make use for now.\n\n18\n00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,840\nNow that's all going to change.\n\n19\n00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,150\nSo if you're watching this live\nright now while we record it,\n\n20\n00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,530\nyeah, there's only one example but if\nyou're watching this six months from now,\n\n21\n00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,810\nthere might be many examples, all right.\n\n22\n00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,040\nBut the example I'm gonna use\ntoday is 2-Step Verification.\n\n23\n00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,140\nGoogle apps supports 2-Step\nVerification for users.\n\n24\n00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,700\nWhen a user logs in,\nby default, they do one step.\n\n25\n00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,640\nThey provide a user name and\na password and they log in.\n\n26\n00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,320\nBut what if somebody gets\na hold of their password?\n\n27\n00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040\nThen, now their verification is ruined,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,150\nThis other person can\nauthenticate as them.\n\n29\n00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,400\nSo what 2-Step does is it adds\na second factor of authentication.\n\n30\n00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,430\nSo when they login, you've got\na username and a password, sure.\n\n31\n00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,000\nBut you've also got a code,\n\n32\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,690\na code that's changing every\n30 seconds that you punch in.\n\n33\n00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,870\nAnd you'll use a device like a token or\nusually\n\n34\n00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,750\nthe Google Authenticator app running on\nyour cell phone is a great way to do this.\n\n35\n00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,060\nAnd you'll see what your code is,\nyou punch in that code, and you log in.\n\n36\n00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,910\nThat gives us a nice, higher level of\nsecurity and it prevents people from using\n\n37\n00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,860\nthings like key loggers to be able\nto get somebody's password and\n\n38\n00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,600\nauthenticate as that user.\n\n39\n00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,190\nSo if we want to turn that on, great.\n\n40\n00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,600\nHere's the challenge though.\n\n41\n00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,750\nWhen you turn on 2-Step Verification,\nyou turn it on or\n\n42\n00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,310\noff based on your organizational\nstructure, right?\n\n43\n00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,390\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n44\n00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,340\nSo when I go into my organizational\nstructure, I can go into my Google apps.\n\n45\n00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,440\nActually, hang on,\nI need to go into my security.\n\n46\n00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,594\nSo I'm gonna go into my Admin console and\nI'll go into Security.\n\n47\n00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:45,139\nAnd inside of Security, you'll see where\nwe've got things like our Basic settings,\n\n48\n00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,710\nSingle sign-on and all that.\n\n49\n00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,660\nAnd here's the Enforce 2-Step\nVerification right there.\n\n50\n00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,760\nI'm gonna choose the Basic settings.\n\n51\n00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,660\nAnd when I go in the Basic settings,\n\n52\n00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,120\nyou'll see where we can turn on\n2-Step Verification, all right.\n\n53\n00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,470\nNow when we turn it on here, well,\nit's actually already on for\n\n54\n00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,710\nme, Allow users to turn\non 2-Step Verification.\n\n55\n00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,130\nGreat, all right.\n\n56\n00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,359\nBut that's giving the users\nthe option to do it, right?\n\n57\n00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,300\nThey could choose not to do it.\n\n58\n00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,660\nThey could choose to ignore it.\n\n59\n00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,510\nWhat if I want to enforce it?\n\n60\n00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,550\nI wanna force my users to\nuse 2-Step Verification.\n\n61\n00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,060\nWell for\nthat I have to go to my Advance settings.\n\n62\n00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,750\nAnd in the advanced settings this is\nthe screen we've seen in other segments\n\n63\n00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,662\nwhere we can choose our security settings\nbased on our organizational structure,\n\n64\n00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:28,760\nall right.\n\n65\n00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,530\nSo it might be that I've\ngot contractors and\n\n66\n00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,640\nI want my contractors to all\nuse 2-Step Verification, but\n\n67\n00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,310\nI don't want my retired people to\nhave to use 2-Step Verification.\n\n68\n00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,550\nWell, I can do that.\n\n69\n00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,220\nWhen I go in here, if I choose ITProTV,\nif I choose my parent organization,\n\n70\n00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,410\nI'm affecting settings for the whole\ncompany but if I choose just contractors,\n\n71\n00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,150\nnow I'm just affecting that sub-org.\n\n72\n00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,400\nSo we've seen that before,\nthat's not anything new.\n\n73\n00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,660\nBut here's the thing,\nif I go into Contractors and\n\n74\n00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,120\nI turn on enforcement, right,\nit gives me a warning, this will\n\n75\n00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,832\nforce users to enter a verification code\neach time they sign in, and I hit OK.\n\n76\n00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,830\nAll right, well when I do that,\n\n77\n00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,190\nwhat happens to a user that hasn't\nset up 2-Step Verification yet?\n\n78\n00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,540\nIf somebody hasn't set it up, I'm now\nrequiring it, they just got locked out.\n\n79\n00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,416\nNow they can't log in, all right.\n\n80\n00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,742\nSo what we need to do when we set up\n2-Step Verification is we need to turn it\n\n81\n00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:31,360\non, right, hit that allow users to use\n2-Step and then give them time to enroll.\n\n82\n00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,500\nAnd once they've enrolled,\nthen we can switch to enforcement, right?\n\n83\n00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,950\nNow we're enforcing and\nthey'll have to use their code.\n\n84\n00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,190\nBut what happens when\nyou hire a new employee?\n\n85\n00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,580\nWhen you hire somebody new,\nyou've gotta give them time to enroll.\n\n86\n00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,230\nAnd if you're enforcing,\nwell, they don't have time.\n\n87\n00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,120\nThey're already required to put in\na code before they've even been able to\n\n88\n00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,990\nset it up, so that creates a problem.\n\n89\n00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,550\nAnd that's why Google\nintroduced group filters.\n\n90\n00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,540\nAnd you'll see the group filter\nright here down at the bottom left.\n\n91\n00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,220\nNow this is not present on\nmost settings yet, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,730\nIn the future we're gonna see this appear\nmore and more and you'll recognize it.\n\n93\n00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,380\nYou'll just see it as group filter\nright down here at the bottom.\n\n94\n00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,080\nAnd what we can do is we can use groups\nto influence whether this applies or\n\n95\n00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240\ndoesn't, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,450\nSo it's an additional layer of\nfiltering we can do in addition\n\n97\n00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,780\nto our organizational structure,\nall right.\n\n98\n00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,400\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nwhip up two groups real quick.\n\n99\n00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,000\nOr I guess I don't really need two groups,\nI can create just an exception.\n\n100\n00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,250\nBut what we can do is we can go and\nI'll just jump back to my Dashboard.\n\n101\n00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,145\nAnd here I'm gonna go into my groups.\n\n102\n00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:42,757\nSo under More controls > Groups, I'm gonna\ncreate a group here which I will call,\n\n103\n00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:47,481\nmaybe this is New Employee,\nor On-Boarding Employee, or\n\n104\n00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:52,500\nNon 2-Step Verification, or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n105\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,130\nSo I'm just gonna call this one\nNew Employee is what I'll do.\n\n106\n00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,250\nAnd you have to give it an address, so\n\n107\n00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,750\nI'll just call it\nnewemployee@itvprotv.net.\n\n108\n00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,436\nAnd in the description I'm gonna\nput in here, users in this, or\n\n109\n00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:08,000\nactually we can call it New Contractor,\nif we wanna be a little more specific.\n\n110\n00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,110\nWe'll change that.\n\n111\n00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,900\nSo these'll be New Contractors, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,250\nAnd I'll say users in this group are not\nrequired to use 2-Step Verification.\n\n113\n00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,620\nAll right?\n\n114\n00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,490\nAnd so I'm gonna make it where people\nin this group are an exception.\n\n115\n00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,710\nThey don't have to have\n2-Step Verification,\n\n116\n00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,050\nand this is where I'll put new people.\n\n117\n00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,860\nThis will give them a chance to log in and\nenroll in 2-Step and\n\n118\n00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,430\nget it set up, and\nthen I can take them out of this group.\n\n119\n00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,570\nAnd when I take them out of the group, now\nthey are required to use 2-Step, right.\n\n120\n00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,650\nSo I can use this group to kind of\ncontrol that access, all right.\n\n121\n00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,460\nAnd I'm gonna do it here with one\ngroup where I've turned it on on\n\n122\n00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,390\nthe contractors' organization, and\nthese guys will be exceptions.\n\n123\n00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,340\nBut you could also create two groups,\none for pre-enrolled users and\n\n124\n00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,480\none for post-enrolled users and you can\njust move them after they enroll so\n\n125\n00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040\nthat they're now set to require that way.\n\n126\n00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,480\nYou can go either way, there's a lot\nof flexibility here, all right.\n\n127\n00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,750\nSo I'm just gonna create this group.\n\n128\n00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,395\nI'm not really worried about access levels\ndown here as far as what they can use,\n\n129\n00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:15,280\ncuz I'm just using this\ngroup as a security filter.\n\n130\n00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,820\nI'm not using it as an email\nmailing list or anything like that.\n\n131\n00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,720\nSo I'm not really gonna check\nany other options here.\n\n132\n00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,890\nI'm just gonna create the group\ncalled New Contractor, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,460\nThen I can go back to\nmy Security settings.\n\n134\n00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,620\nSo back on my Dashboard I'll\ngo to More Controls>Security.\n\n135\n00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,260\nAnd I'll go into my Basic\nsettings here where we set\n\n136\n00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,890\nup our 2-Step, and actually need to\ngo into the Advanced settings anyway.\n\n137\n00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,724\nSo I'll go into Advanced settings.\n\n138\n00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,380\nOr actually, you know what?\n\n139\n00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,560\nI do need to go back to Basic settings.\n\n140\n00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120\nLet me go back to Basic settings and\n\n141\n00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,566\nI need to go to the Advanced settings for\n2-Step, so I'm just gonna go there.\n\n142\n00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,470\nAnd inside of the Advanced settings for\n2-Step, this is where I came in and\n\n143\n00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,380\nwent to Contractors and\nI turned on enforcement.\n\n144\n00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,530\nSo when I hire a new employee or\nbring on a new contractor and\n\n145\n00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,150\nI create an account for them,\nI'm gonna put them in this sub-org, and\n\n146\n00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,930\nthey'll be required to use 2-Step.\n\n147\n00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,190\nBut then down here I can\ncreate a group filter.\n\n148\n00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,530\nAnd I'm gonna create a filter for\n\n149\n00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,650\nthe New Contractor group that I just made,\nall right.\n\n150\n00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,020\nAnd notice what happens.\n\n151\n00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,100\nWhen I've got Contractors chosen,\nit says Turn on enforcement.\n\n152\n00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,310\nWhen I click on New Contractor,\nthe screen updates.\n\n153\n00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,660\nAnd it happens really fast, so\n\n154\n00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,220\nyou can't see it but\nit's still saying Turn on enforcement,\n\n155\n00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,540\nI'm gonna choose Turn off enforcement,\nand hit Save changes, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,690\nNow what that just did,\nis it applied to the New Contractor group.\n\n157\n00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,530\nIf I choose No admin group selected,\nit says Turn on enforcement.\n\n158\n00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,760\nIf I choose New Contractor,\nit says turn off enforcement.\n\n159\n00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,250\nSo now when I create my contractors, if\nthey're new accounts I stick them in that\n\n160\n00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,430\nNew Contractor group and\nthey won't have to have 2-Step.\n\n161\n00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,305\nThat'll give them a chance to log in\nwith the temporary password we set and\n\n162\n00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,693\nenroll in the 2-Step process, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,893\nOnce that's done, I can go and\ntake them out of this group,\n\n164\n00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:14,490\ntake them out of the New Contractor group.\n\n165\n00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,699\nSo now they'll be in this No\nadmin group selected, right.\n\n166\n00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:21,021\nAnd now they will be\nrequired to use enforcement.\n\n167\n00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:27,070\nSo this allows us to have different levels\nof people within a single organization.\n\n168\n00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,990\nNow there is another way I could do this.\n\n169\n00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,930\nI could create multiple sub-orgs here.\n\n170\n00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,340\nI could have a sub-org under\nContractors called New Contractors, and\n\n171\n00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,490\nhave that one not require 2-Step and then\nmove them to another org when they do.\n\n172\n00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,325\nSo you could go that route but the group\nmethod is a little bit easier because we\n\n173\n00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,380\ncan also use this for communications.\n\n174\n00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,610\nSo, maybe we send an email out once\na day to the New Contractor group,\n\n175\n00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,370\nsaying you need to enroll in 2-Step,\nall right.\n\n176\n00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,020\nAnd that way, if they haven't done it,\nthey're getting this reminder,\n\n177\n00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,550\nyou need to enroll in 2-Step and\nwe can keep track of that and\n\n178\n00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,310\nthen see who's been enrolled, all right.\n\n179\n00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,570\nWe're gonna talk more about 2-Step in\nanother segment, but just as a little\n\n180\n00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,870\ncaveat here, if you want to figure out\nwhich of your users have enrolled and\n\n181\n00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,760\nwhich ones haven't, there's not\nreally a great way here in the GUI.\n\n182\n00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,210\nIf we go back to our Dashboard and\nwe go into the reporting subsystem.\n\n183\n00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,620\nSo I'll go to More controls > Reports.\n\n184\n00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,100\nNone of the reports show us whether\nsomebody is 2-Step enrolled or not.\n\n185\n00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,230\nYou don't see it here, all right.\n\n186\n00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,230\nSo, what you really need to do is,\nif you go to Security, that's a good one.\n\n187\n00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,030\nOn the security screen you'll see\ninformation about your users and\n\n188\n00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,930\nyou can use the Download button up here.\n\n189\n00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,420\nAnd when you hit Download,\nit'll export as a CSV and\n\n190\n00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,510\none of the columns in that CSV will\nshow whether they're 2-Step enrolled.\n\n191\n00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,870\nAnd so you can use that to see quickly\nhow many people in your organization have\n\n192\n00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,780\nactually 2-Step enrolled or not, and\n\n193\n00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,730\ndetermine who needs to be in that\ngroup and who doesn't, all right.\n\n194\n00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,750\nBut that's not the point of this segment.\n\n195\n00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,560\nThe point of this segment was to show that\nwe can create exceptions to the rule.\n\n196\n00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,520\nAnd it's a fairly limited feature today so\n\n197\n00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,180\nthat's really the only example I can show\nyou, but expect to see it in the future.\n\n198\n00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,230\nExpect to see areas where you go through\nto configure settings especially with\n\n199\n00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,650\nthings like device management, where\nyou'll start to see exceptions there.\n\n200\n00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,300\nAnd it's definitely something\nyou'll want to take advantage of,\n\n201\n00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,320\nbecause you might not want certain things\nto apply to administrators versus regular\n\n202\n00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400\nusers and so on.\n\n203\n00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,260\nSo expect to see that admin group filter\nstart to appear down here in more and\n\n204\n00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,940\nmore areas.\n\n205\n00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,040\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,510\nSo in this segment, we got a chance\nto take a look at using groups\n\n207\n00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,220\nto manage our security settings in\naddition to sub-organizations, right, so\n\n208\n00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,100\nthat we can apply filters and change the\nway that settings apply to different users\n\n209\n00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,940\nat different points in our organization.\n\n210\n00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,328\nI hope you guys enjoyed it, stay tuned,\nwe've got more Google apps coming up.\n\n211\n00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:58,729\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17,334\nThe official title is,\nDemonstrate How to Configure SSO, OAuth,\n\n4\n00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,454\nand 2-step verification.\n\n5\n00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,515\nIt's a mouthful of acronyms.\n\n6\n00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:24,505\nAll right, so let's take a look at each\none of these, kinda see what they do, and\n\n7\n00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,385\nhow we go about configuring them.\n\n8\n00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,974\nThe first one they call out is SSO,\nsingle sign-on.\n\n9\n00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:33,450\nAnd single sign-on is, fortunately,\nthe easiest of the ones to configure,\n\n10\n00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790\nbecause it's already turned on.\n\n11\n00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,520\nGoogle Apps uses a single sign on method.\n\n12\n00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,200\nSo when a user signs in to any one\nof the various Google Apps services,\n\n13\n00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,400\nthey're given an authentication token.\n\n14\n00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,210\nAnd that token is then valid for\n\n15\n00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,520\nauthenticating against any of\nthe other Google Apps services.\n\n16\n00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,540\nSo if I went to Gmail and\nI logged in with my Google apps account,\n\n17\n00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,280\nI'm now sitting on\nan authentication token.\n\n18\n00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,210\nIf I turn around and go to YouTube,\nI don't have to login a second time.\n\n19\n00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,680\nI'm already logged in.\n\n20\n00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,800\nYouTube will recognize me by my Google\napps authentication token and let me in.\n\n21\n00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,030\nAnd I'll have my access.\n\n22\n00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,630\nAnd if I jump over to Blogger or\na Google site, or\n\n23\n00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,840\nany of the other various services,\nagain, I'm already logged in.\n\n24\n00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,200\nSo, it's really neat and,\nas far as configuration,\n\n25\n00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,220\nthere's not really much to it.\n\n26\n00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,410\nSo, you might ask yourself\nif it's on by default,\n\n27\n00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,290\nhow do I demonstrate how to configure it?\n\n28\n00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,120\nWell there's not really much\nto demonstrate on this one.\n\n29\n00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,040\nWe can see some of\nthe informations though.\n\n30\n00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,706\nIf we go into our Admin console,\nand go into, Security.\n\n31\n00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,340\nAnd I have to authenticate here,\nmy session has timed out.\n\n32\n00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,260\nSo let me authenticate real quick.\n\n33\n00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,830\nSo I'm in my Admin console and\nI'm going into the security settings.\n\n34\n00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,130\nYou'll see right down here at the bottom,\nset up single sign on, SSO.\n\n35\n00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,970\nAnd if I click on that, we'll see some\nbasic options that are over here,\n\n36\n00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,050\nand what these are doing is\nmodifying how single sign on works.\n\n37\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,390\nBy default, SSO is only within\nthe Google apps services.\n\n38\n00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,680\nBut what if you have\nthird party systems and\n\n39\n00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,890\nyou want to do a single\nsign-on against them?\n\n40\n00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,470\nSo for example, maybe you have a Microsoft\nWindows active directory in place.\n\n41\n00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,060\nAnd all of your users already have\naccounts in the active directory.\n\n42\n00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,300\nAnd so,when somebody logs on into Google\nApps you don't wanna do a single sign\n\n43\n00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,120\non against Google Apps.\n\n44\n00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,900\nYou want to do a single sign on\nagainst the active directory.\n\n45\n00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,000\nYou wanna have your users have\na true single user identity,\n\n46\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,350\nthat they use when they\nlogin to whatever system.\n\n47\n00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,970\nBe it Google Apps or\nthe desktop back at the office.\n\n48\n00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,250\nWell, for that, you can override SSO.\n\n49\n00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,270\nAnd say, instead of authenticating\nstraight up against Google apps,\n\n50\n00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,310\nwe can authenticate against your\nexisting SSO infrastructure.\n\n51\n00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,260\nAnd so you can come in here and\nspecify that.\n\n52\n00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,970\nSet up SSO with third\nparty identity provider.\n\n53\n00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,840\nSo SSO between Google app services.\n\n54\n00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,760\nIt's already on,\nyou don't have to configure it, it's done.\n\n55\n00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,350\nThe only time we have to do configuration\nis if we want to change that to\n\n56\n00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,830\nauthenticate against a third party system.\n\n57\n00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,260\nNow third party system's vary greatly, so\n\n58\n00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,180\nI don't have one great\nexample that I can show you.\n\n59\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,500\nCuz you might be authenticating\nagainst a Solaris NIS Plus domain.\n\n60\n00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,040\nYou might have a Windows Active Directory,\na Novel eDirectory.\n\n61\n00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,150\nYou might have a really advanced\nidentity system like Shebolith in place,\n\n62\n00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,660\nand that one will let you do all sorts of\ncross authentication for various things.\n\n63\n00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,530\nAnd when you set those up, almost all\nof the venders out there these days\n\n64\n00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,210\nsupport SAML,\nwhich is an authentication protocol.\n\n65\n00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,240\nAnd that's exactly what\nGoogle's SSO is doing.\n\n66\n00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,790\nSo you punch in the URL for\nthe sign-in page, or sign-out pages,\n\n67\n00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,660\nwhere they go to change their password,\nand you specify a certificate to\n\n68\n00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,580\nuse to authenticate the server,\ntheir Google app servers.\n\n69\n00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,750\nTalking to your authentication server.\n\n70\n00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,040\nAnd when that's done, when the user\ngoes to log in, instead of issuing\n\n71\n00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,430\nthe certificate straight from Google apps,\nit will send them to the sign-on page.\n\n72\n00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,460\nAnd they'll sign in to your system,\n\n73\n00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,700\nWhich in turn will be issuing that token\nand we'll receive that here on the server\n\n74\n00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,360\nto continue cross authenticating\nthem across the other services.\n\n75\n00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,520\nSo here's where we go and\nspecify this information.\n\n76\n00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,685\nAnd so if you're the Google Apps\nadministrator, you'll have to reach out to\n\n77\n00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:26,290\nwhoever your identity administrator is\nto get this information to punch in.\n\n78\n00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,820\nNow you can also specify\nsubnet masks down here.\n\n79\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,450\nWhich say only do SSO if the user's IP\naddress falls within a certain range.\n\n80\n00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,870\nSo you can specify that down here\nto limit who's leveraging this SSO\n\n81\n00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,150\npiece and who isn't.\n\n82\n00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,560\nYou might have external\nusers like contractors.\n\n83\n00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,570\nThat you don't want to use the SSOPs.\n\n84\n00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,880\nBut you have your internal\nemployees that you do.\n\n85\n00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,340\nSo you can specify that right here.\n\n86\n00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,000\nThose are the only configuration\noptions we have for SSO and\n\n87\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,850\nit looks deceptively simple like\nI just punch in a few things.\n\n88\n00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,520\nThe hard work is on the SSO side.\n\n89\n00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,400\nSo whatever your single sign-on\nsystem is if it's Shibboleth or\n\n90\n00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,150\nWindows Active Directory\nFederation Services or\n\n91\n00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,500\nsomething like that,\nyou've got a lot of work to do on that end\n\n92\n00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,970\nto get them set up to be ready to\nreceive these requests from Google apps.\n\n93\n00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,700\nBut on the Google apps side, it's really\njust a matter of punching in URLs, and\n\n94\n00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,390\nonce they're in there,\nyou're now set up for single sign-on.\n\n95\n00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,580\nNow, a similar technology\nto single sign-on Is OAuth.\n\n96\n00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,290\nOAuth is the open authentication standard.\n\n97\n00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,240\nAnd OAuth,\nIt's been around a little while.\n\n98\n00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,870\nIt was part of an initiative where\na lot of vendors were saying look,\n\n99\n00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,100\nI have to have login accounts for\nso many different sites, right?\n\n100\n00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,000\nI have a login for Google,\nand a login for Microsoft,\n\n101\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,410\nand a login for Ebay, and PayPal, and so\non, right, all these different accounts.\n\n102\n00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,100\nWell wouldn't it be nice if\nyou had one account that you\n\n103\n00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,940\nused on all those different sites?\n\n104\n00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,790\nAnd that's what brought\nabout the OAuth standard.\n\n105\n00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,760\nIt's a standard for of authentication\nwhere sites can share this and\n\n106\n00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,080\nyou see it used very very commonly.\n\n107\n00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,760\nYou'll go to a website And it maybe\nsomething like, well like Hootsuite.\n\n108\n00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,120\nThat's the little program I use for\nsending tweets.\n\n109\n00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,780\nWhen I go to Hootsuite its got the option\nto log in with my Google account.\n\n110\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,710\nI don't have to login with\na dedicated Hootsuite account.\n\n111\n00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,010\nI could, but I can just use my Google\naccount and it works just fine.\n\n112\n00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,520\nAnd it's doing that through OAuth and\n\n113\n00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,810\nother technologies like that that allow us\nto share authentication between systems.\n\n114\n00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,450\nSo OAuth is a standard,\nGoogle is OAuth 2.0 compatible.\n\n115\n00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,610\nThey do not support\nOAuth version 1 anymore.\n\n116\n00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,040\nThey've bumped that one off.\n\n117\n00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,650\nThey just do 2.0.\n\n118\n00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,005\nSo, if you have a website that\nsupports OAuth 2.0 authentication,\n\n119\n00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:48,060\nthen you can have it reach out and\ntap in to Google system to do it, alright?\n\n120\n00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,320\nNow, on the admin side,\nthere is no configuration for OAuth.\n\n121\n00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,300\nYou won't see an OAuth entry in here for\ngoing in and turning that on, and\n\n122\n00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,260\nthat's because it's something\nthat developers do.\n\n123\n00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,920\nThe developers who are writing software\napplications that were writing that\n\n124\n00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,970\nauthentication piece, they're the ones\nwho develop the OAuth support.\n\n125\n00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,670\nSo it's only exposed through\nthe API's in Google Apps,\n\n126\n00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,320\nwhich you don't see here\nin the user interface.\n\n127\n00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,360\nSo for most of us,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n128\n00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,120\nBut if you are a developer and\nyou're interested in learning about it,\n\n129\n00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,150\nin the show notes for this episode,\nhere we go, I'll post on the show notes.\n\n130\n00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,352\nI actually have the link\nto the developer's site and\n\n131\n00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,730\nlet me just show that\nto you guys real quick.\n\n132\n00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,780\nSo you can see it.\n\n133\n00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,840\nThey have all of the information\npublished that you'd need to go and\n\n134\n00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,130\nwrite a web application,\nto do OAuth 2.0 access to Google.\n\n135\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,730\nAnd it's fairly straightforward but\n\n136\n00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,840\nthey show all the information on the web\nserver side, the client's side, and so\n\n137\n00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,870\non of what you need to do to\nform that URL and get connected.\n\n138\n00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,510\nOn the exam, they don't go into that.\n\n139\n00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,842\nOn the exam, we just need to be aware\nthat OAuth support is there and so\n\n140\n00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,342\nwe could use it if we wanted to.\n\n141\n00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:04,339\nAll right, the last thing mentioned in\nthis objective Is two step verification.\n\n142\n00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,103\nWhat is two step verification?\n\n143\n00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:11,573\nWhen a user logs in, be it SSO,\nbe it whatever, when they log in,\n\n144\n00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:17,010\nthe traditional log in model is to\nrequire a user name and a password.\n\n145\n00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,400\nAnd Google Apps is no exception, the\ndefault authentication mechanism is you\n\n146\n00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,820\nlog in with your email address,\nthat's your user name, and your password.\n\n147\n00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,650\nWell, the problem with a password is\nthat someone could run a key logger and\n\n148\n00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,560\npossibly capture your password, and now\nthey know it, or they could brute force to\n\n149\n00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,910\njust try and guess your password, and\npotentially guess what your password is.\n\n150\n00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,430\nSo passwords have an inherent\nweakness built into them.\n\n151\n00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,170\nDoesn't matter how many\ncharacters you use.\n\n152\n00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,400\nYou might have a 30 character\npassword with uppercase letters and\n\n153\n00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,380\nlowercase letters and special characters.\n\n154\n00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,260\nBut if somebody is running a key logger,\nthey'll capture a 30\n\n155\n00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,520\ncharacter password with the same amount\nof effort as a two character password.\n\n156\n00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,040\nSo, passwords have an inherent\nweakness built in to them\n\n157\n00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,290\nin the fact that they can be learned.\n\n158\n00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,020\nSo, what two step authentication does,\nis it adds a second\n\n159\n00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,320\nfactor of authentication to make it\nharder to capture a password like that.\n\n160\n00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,310\nRight.\nTwo-step\n\n161\n00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,750\nauthentication normally takes the form of\nsomething you know and something you have.\n\n162\n00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,550\nThe something you know is\nusually your password.\n\n163\n00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,310\nThe password is something you've got in\nyour mind, that's something you know.\n\n164\n00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,500\nAnd then there's something you have, it's\nnormally a physical item that you hold.\n\n165\n00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,600\nSomething like a smart card,\nor your thumb print, right.\n\n166\n00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,480\nWell I guess that's something\nyou are is what they call that.\n\n167\n00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,760\nBut it's something you've\ngot in your possession.\n\n168\n00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,840\nWell, we can't always do that.\n\n169\n00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,940\nNot every computer has\na smart card reader.\n\n170\n00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,860\nNot every computer has\na thumb print scanner.\n\n171\n00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,130\nGoogle set out to find the best\nway to go about doing this,\n\n172\n00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,360\nto make it as accessible as possible.\n\n173\n00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,490\nThe solution they came up with was\nwhat's called the Google Authenticator.\n\n174\n00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,570\nWith Google Authenticator, coupled with\nthe two step process, when a user logs in,\n\n175\n00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,370\nthey provide their user name and\nthey provide a code.\n\n176\n00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,890\nAnd the code changes every 30 seconds.\n\n177\n00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,920\nEvery 30 seconds, this code is changing.\n\n178\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,700\nLet me show you what\nthe Google Authenticator looks like.\n\n179\n00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,910\nIt's just a little program.\n\n180\n00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,960\nYou run it on your cell phone.\n\n181\n00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,340\nOr there's third parties that make\napplications that can do it too.\n\n182\n00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,910\nBut we normally just run it on our\ncell phone, and this is it right here.\n\n183\n00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,650\nAnd it just displays your code.\n\n184\n00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,750\nAnd that code changes every 30 seconds.\n\n185\n00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,410\nSo when you log in, that's your password.\n\n186\n00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,550\nIt's the same as if you changed\nyour password every 30 seconds.\n\n187\n00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,230\nIt's pretty crazy.\n\n188\n00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,630\nIf someone were running a key logger and\ncaptured this password, it's only good for\n\n189\n00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,500\n30 seconds.\n\n190\n00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,580\nSo they're not gonna be able to use it.\n\n191\n00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,290\nThere are also one time passwords,\nso they can only be used once.\n\n192\n00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,550\nThe instant you use it, it's been negated,\nso even if somebody did capture it,\n\n193\n00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,050\nif they captured it by you using it,\nit's already been negated.\n\n194\n00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,600\nSo this adds a very\nhigh level of security.\n\n195\n00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,460\nWhen you go to log in,\nyou log in with your email address and\n\n196\n00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,230\nthen there's that something you have.\n\n197\n00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,140\nYou need your cell phone that's running\nthe application that shows this code, or\n\n198\n00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,060\nyou can have it on your tablet.\n\n199\n00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,330\nAnd the Google Authenticator is\none application that does it.\n\n200\n00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,910\nAnother one that's out there is Authy.\n\n201\n00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,150\nAuthy is a third party one that\ndoes the same basic thing.\n\n202\n00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,285\nIt displays your code and\nit fully integrates with Google Apps.\n\n203\n00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:16,410\nSo whichever solution you want to use.\n\n204\n00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,160\nAnd the idea is that people aren't\ngoing to lose their cell phone or\n\n205\n00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,760\nleave it behind.\n\n206\n00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920\nPeople will remember to\nbring their cell phone.\n\n207\n00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,820\nAnd if they do they can always\nreach out to an administrator and\n\n208\n00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,350\nwe can let them into the system.\n\n209\n00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,140\nSo two step authentication\nit is a great solution.\n\n210\n00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,410\nIt really eliminates key logging and\nbrute forcing of passwords.\n\n211\n00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,540\nThose things become impossible.\n\n212\n00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,340\nOr next to impossible.\n\n213\n00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,270\nSo if we want to turn on\ntwo step verification\n\n214\n00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,020\nit appropriately is a two step process.\n\n215\n00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,400\nProcess number one,\nwe turn it on on our server.\n\n216\n00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,290\nAnd then process number two,\nwe get our users to sign up for it.\n\n217\n00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,190\nThey have to do what's called enrollment.\n\n218\n00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,340\nYou enroll in two steps, to say that I'm\ngonna start using this on my account,\n\n219\n00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,460\nall right?\n\n220\n00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,910\nSo those are the two\nsteps that we have to do.\n\n221\n00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,390\nThere is a third step that's kind\nof optional which is enforcement.\n\n222\n00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,320\nWhen we turn on two step It's optional.\n\n223\n00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,160\nOur users can choose to use two step,\nor they can choose not to.\n\n224\n00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,800\nThey can choose to stay the old way.\n\n225\n00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,230\nBut we might want to enforce it,\nto make them use two step, and\n\n226\n00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,350\nif they don't, we don't let them log in.\n\n227\n00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,540\nSo that's that third step,\nis whether we want to enforce it.\n\n228\n00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,150\nThe first step is just turning on\ntwo step, and it's really easy.\n\n229\n00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,040\nIn fact, it should already be\nturned on for your account.\n\n230\n00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,050\nAll you do is go into your Admin console,\nand then go into your Security settings.\n\n231\n00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,450\nSo, I'll go down here to More controls,\nand Security.\n\n232\n00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,730\nAnd, under Basic settings,\nyou'll see 2 step verification.\n\n233\n00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,520\nAll right, when I choose Basic\nsettings over here on the right side,\n\n234\n00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,570\nI can scroll down a bit here and\nI'll find two step verification.\n\n235\n00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,067\nAnd see how mine already says, Allow\nusers to turn on 2-step verification,\n\n236\n00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,720\nit's already checked, it's already on.\n\n237\n00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160\nMy end users can use it if they want to.\n\n238\n00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,720\nIf I don't want two step, I expressly\ndo not want it, my organization,\n\n239\n00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,560\nI can uncheck that, and now none of my\nusers will be able to use two step.\n\n240\n00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,040\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncheck it, and hit Save.\n\n241\n00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,880\nIt was already on, so\nI didn't really do anything there.\n\n242\n00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,560\nNow, my users can choose to enroll.\n\n243\n00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,890\nWell, how do they enroll?\n\n244\n00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,570\nWell all they have to do\nif they're ready to enroll\n\n245\n00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,890\nis they can log into any of\nthe Google apps services.\n\n246\n00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,690\nThey can log into Gmail,\nor Calendar or whatever.\n\n247\n00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,490\nAnd when they're logged in they\ncan go up here to their user name,\n\n248\n00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,600\nand they can drop that down and\nchoose account.\n\n249\n00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,750\nAnd that's gonna view their\nuser account settings.\n\n250\n00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,280\nAnd right here in their user account\nsettings, they can go to security and\n\n251\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,220\nit's underneath security that\nyou got two step verification.\n\n252\n00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,240\nNow if we've prohibited that\nin our Google Apps domain\n\n253\n00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,810\nthen they won't be able\nto choose this option.\n\n254\n00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,720\nIt'll show as disabled and\nthey won't be able to start it.\n\n255\n00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,340\nBut since it's turned on\nI've got the setup option.\n\n256\n00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,580\nAnd I can hit Setup and\nI can start that process.\n\n257\n00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,180\nWhen you hit Setup, it's gonna give\nyou a description of what this is and\n\n258\n00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,870\nthen you can start the process.\n\n259\n00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,500\nAll right?\n\n260\n00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,080\nIt's gonna make you re-authenticate to\nshow that you are who you say you are.\n\n261\n00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480\nAnd so I'll just punch that in there.\n\n262\n00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,890\nAnd now it's asking about a phone to use.\n\n263\n00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,800\nThis is really tied to a phone.\n\n264\n00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,790\nAt the end of the day, you could tie\nthis to your tablet if you want,\n\n265\n00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,730\nor even a laptop if you\nwanted instead of a phone.\n\n266\n00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,510\nBut the phone is the one item that\nwe expect people to have on them so\n\n267\n00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,130\nit's the most ideal.\n\n268\n00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,410\nSo you would punch in\na phone number here and\n\n269\n00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,820\nthey would either send you a text\nmessage or give you a call.\n\n270\n00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,550\nAll right?\n\n271\n00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,240\nWhen they do that, it's reaching out to\nverify that you actually have that phone.\n\n272\n00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,270\nOnce they verify that you've\ngot the phone, then we'll\n\n273\n00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,700\nbe able to move forward and\nwe'll specify the other information.\n\n274\n00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,390\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\npunch in a phone here.\n\n275\n00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,340\nLet's see what phone do I want to use for\nthis one.\n\n276\n00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,672\nI've got to think of one I don't already\nhave Google authenticator tied to.\n\n277\n00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:03,390\nAll right, so in the background here I've\ntyped in my phone number and I hit Next.\n\n278\n00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,450\nAnd it sent me a text message, so I got\na text message with a little code and\n\n279\n00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,890\nit asked me to verify that so\nI punched in my code.\n\n280\n00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,120\nNow it knows that I have this cellphone.\n\n281\n00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,810\nThis is actually in my possession.\n\n282\n00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,190\nAnd it's asking you whether or\n\n283\n00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,340\nnot I want to trust the computer\nthat I'm on right now.\n\n284\n00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,570\nIf I choose to trust it on this computer,\nI won't have to punch in a code.\n\n285\n00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,360\nI'll be able to log in\nwith my email address and\n\n286\n00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,140\npassword like normal without a code,\ncuz this is a trusted PC.\n\n287\n00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,660\nAll right?\n\n288\n00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,080\nBut if I go to any other PC, I'll have\nto provide the code on the screen.\n\n289\n00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,410\nNow, I might not want that.\n\n290\n00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,270\nI might not wanna trust this and always\nhave to enter in the code on this machine.\n\n291\n00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,790\nIt's up to me.\n\n292\n00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,350\nI'm gonna say,\n\n293\n00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,680\ndon't trust it, just because I wanna\nshow you guys the code entry, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,930\nSo now I can go ahead and hit Confirm.\n\n295\n00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,510\nAnd it's going to get me set up.\n\n296\n00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,340\nAnd so it's got my information on here,\n\n297\n00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,490\nand now I just need to get my\nGoogle Authenticator set up.\n\n298\n00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,920\nAnd to get Google Authenticator set up,\nwell, I need to install it on my phone.\n\n299\n00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,011\nSo I'll have an Android phone or\nan iPhone or\n\n300\n00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:09,658\na whatever is that I'm going to use And\nin here it can generate a QR code.\n\n301\n00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:13,551\nA little code that we can scan\nthat'll let us see the information and\n\n302\n00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,200\nget it tied in so we can have\nthat code jumping on our phone.\n\n303\n00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,150\nSo you'll see down here Get codes\nvia our mobile app instead, and\n\n304\n00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,110\nit says the Android iPhone Blackberry app\nwill let us connect and start to use that.\n\n305\n00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,940\nSo I can hit Switch to app, and it's going\nto let me switch that, I'll choose iPhone.\n\n306\n00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,180\nAnd when I hit Continue, right here\nit gives me this qr code to scan.\n\n307\n00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,120\nAnd all I have to do it take my phone\nwhich I'll take mine right here and\n\n308\n00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,422\nI'll choose to scan the code.\n\n309\n00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:45,970\nAll right, and\nI'm just gonna scan that QR code and\n\n310\n00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,750\nthat's how it's gonna know what Google\ncode to start showing on my screen.\n\n311\n00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,090\nAnd it takes effect right away, I know you\nguys aren't gonna be able to see this very\n\n312\n00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,120\nwell, but it's actually displaying my six\ndigit code right there on the phone and\n\n313\n00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,060\nit's changing every 30 seconds.\n\n314\n00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,680\nSo I've got a little timer that's ticking\ndown right now and I've got a six digit\n\n315\n00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680\ncode that I probably need to type in\nhere instead of talking about it.\n\n316\n00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,604\nSo I'm gonna punch in my current code,\nand I'll hit Verify and Save, and\n\n317\n00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:11,565\nit's verified.\n\n318\n00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:16,410\nAnd now whenever I go to log in\nit will know I've got a code.\n\n319\n00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,227\nSo I'll put in my user name and my\npassword, and then it's gonna ask me for\n\n320\n00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:25,750\nmy code, so I'm gonna go up here and\nlog out, so I'm gonna sign out.\n\n321\n00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,894\nI'm gonna close these other windows\nthat I've got open to Google just so\n\n322\n00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,190\nI'm not signed in anywhere.\n\n323\n00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,110\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:40,680\nAnd I'm gonna go back to my admin console,\nso let me just go to itprotv.net.\n\n325\n00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,960\nAll right, and it's gonna make me log in.\n\n326\n00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,260\nAnd my authentication token should\nbe removed at this point, but\n\n327\n00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,390\nif it isn't, there we go.\n\n328\n00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,260\nNow I'm gonna log in and\nit's asking me for my code.\n\n329\n00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,180\nIf somebody had my password,\nit's not enough.\n\n330\n00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,180\nThey need my password and my code.\n\n331\n00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,060\nAnd I can just look at my cell phone,\nand the code that's on it right now, so\n\n332\n00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:09,090\nI'm gonna punch in this code, and when\nI hit Verify, now I log in and I'm in.\n\n333\n00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,990\nI'm in, I'm able to work,\nand we're in business.\n\n334\n00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,450\nSo that's two step verification.\n\n335\n00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,460\nThe only piece I'm leaving out right\nnow is that this is all optional,\n\n336\n00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,630\nI made it optional for my end user.\n\n337\n00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:26,113\nSo I might want to enforce it, require my\nend users to use two step authentication,\n\n338\n00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:31,020\nand if that's the case,\nI need to go back to my admin console and\n\n339\n00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,188\nI need to change my enforcement policy.\n\n340\n00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:38,333\nAnd we do that by going to More controls,\nand Security,\n\n341\n00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,744\ngoing into our Basic settings,\nand in our Basic settings,\n\n342\n00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:45,940\nif you scroll down, you'll see Two step.\n\n343\n00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,964\nAnd there's a little text message\ndown there at the bottom that says,\n\n344\n00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,440\nGo to advanced settings.\n\n345\n00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,140\nWe have to go to Advanced settings for\nenforcement.\n\n346\n00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,980\nAnd if we go to the Advanced settings\n\n347\n00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,560\nwe'll see the option in here to\nrequire two step authentication.\n\n348\n00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,060\nRight there.\n\n349\n00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,960\nNow it's gonna give us a warning though.\n\n350\n00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,200\nIf anybody didn't enroll,\nwhen I turn on enforcement, they're out.\n\n351\n00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400\nThey can't log in.\n\n352\n00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360\nI've effectively locked\nthem out of the system.\n\n353\n00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,280\nYou have to be careful about this, if we\nturn on enforcement anybody who is not\n\n354\n00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,170\nenrolled in two step is\ngonna be locked out.\n\n355\n00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,150\nSo when we turn on two step we\nneed to give our employees time.\n\n356\n00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,940\nLet them enroll, and once they're\nenrolled then we can turn it on.\n\n357\n00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,430\nNow you can create exceptions and\nI normally do this for new employees.\n\n358\n00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,810\nFor new employees, I put in an exception\nso they don't have to enroll right away.\n\n359\n00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,510\nThey can get in and enroll on their own.\n\n360\n00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,920\nAnd then,\nI can take them out of the exception, and\n\n361\n00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,770\nnow they're enforced to use it.\n\n362\n00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,110\nTo do the exception,\nwe can use group filters down here.\n\n363\n00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,170\nAnd we've recorded that\nin another segment.\n\n364\n00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,050\nLook for the objective that covers,\nactually hang on.\n\n365\n00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,938\nI think I know exactly\nwhich objective it is.\n\n366\n00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:54,397\nI wanna say it's 7.1 or\nsomething like that.\n\n367\n00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:58,959\nSo you can jump over to, yes, 7.1,\nobjective 7.1 where I show how to use\n\n368\n00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:03,870\ngroup filters to create that exception\ngroup to say these people aren't enforced,\n\n369\n00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,980\nbut everybody else is, all right.\n\n370\n00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,950\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n371\n00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,360\nif I turn this on right now\nI'll be okay cuz I'm enrolled.\n\n372\n00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,130\nBut none of my other users are,\nthey're all gonna be locked out.\n\n373\n00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,130\nWhen they log in it's gonna\nforce them to use a code but\n\n374\n00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,420\nthey won't have a code because\nthey haven't enrolled.\n\n375\n00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,290\nSo just be aware of that when\nyou go to configure this and\n\n376\n00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,920\nmake sure your employees\nhave time to enroll.\n\n377\n00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,646\nAll right so in this segment we got\na chance to see single sign on.\n\n378\n00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,111\nWe took a look at and\n\n379\n00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:33,950\nkind of what it does and\nallows multi-authentication between sites.\n\n380\n00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,623\nAnd we wrapped up talking about two-step,\nwhere we got a chance to see using\n\n381\n00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:43,808\na dynamic code that's in our possession as\na second step of authentication to ensure\n\n382\n00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:49,120\nthat key loggers and attacks of that\nnature are not viable in our environment.\n\n383\n00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,370\nThey're all great technologies.\n\n384\n00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,780\nYou definitely want to\ntake advantage of those.\n\n385\n00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,470\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n386\n00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,063\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Google Apps coming up next.\n\n387\n00:20:58,063 --> 00:21:05,063\n[MUSIC]\n\n388\n00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,813\nCan you like blur that out on the screen?\n\n389\n00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,460\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Okay.\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,180\nObjective 8.1 is one of my favorites.\n\n2\n00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,650\nThe Google Groups system inside of Google\nApps at first looks really limited, but\n\n3\n00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,830\nthere's this secret side of Google Groups\nthat's hidden underneath the hood.\n\n4\n00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,200\nWe can turn on a lot of power and\nthat's what this objective is all about.\n\n5\n00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,320\nThe official name is Create a Group that\nwill be used as a shared mailbox for\n\n6\n00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,024\na group of users, Q & A forums and\ndistribution lists.\n\n7\n00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,828\nThat's quite a mouthful.\n\n8\n00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:37,580\nA normal Google group can't\ndo half of that stuff right.\n\n9\n00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,610\nBut let's take a look at\na normal group first and\n\n10\n00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,780\nthen we'll see how we can\nkind of improve upon this.\n\n11\n00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,380\nWhen you set up a Google Apps account,\nthere's a Groups service built into it.\n\n12\n00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,930\nIf we go down here to more controls,\nyou'll see Groups right here, and\n\n13\n00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,405\nthese are your normal, what they call\nthem are admin console Groups, all right?\n\n14\n00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,920\nIt' just Groups that we create that\nare typically used for one of two things.\n\n15\n00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,160\nThey're either used for one, permissions.\n\n16\n00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,800\nGiving people permissions to\naccess various resources.\n\n17\n00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,970\nLike I might share a document,\nor share a site, share a folder\n\n18\n00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,420\nin Google Drive with one of these groups\nso it's really controlling permissions.\n\n19\n00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,020\nOr two,\nusing them as email distribution list.\n\n20\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,680\nSo for example maybe I've got\na sales department in my company.\n\n21\n00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,413\nAnd when somebody inquires about\na sale with my organization they send\n\n22\n00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,667\nan email sales@itprotv.net.\n\n23\n00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:33,520\nWell, I could add sales at ITProTV.net\nas an alias to a user, right.\n\n24\n00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360\nI could go into my users and\n\n25\n00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,480\nI could pick, we'll make\nMarty Friedman our manager of sales.\n\n26\n00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,630\nSo I could go into old Marty Friedman\nhere, I could go into his account and\n\n27\n00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,050\nI could add an alias for him right here.\n\n28\n00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,150\nAnd I could say that his alias\nwas sales@itprotv.net alright.\n\n29\n00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,130\nSo now anytime somebody sends an email\nto sales he would get it all right.\n\n30\n00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,980\nThe problem with that is,\nwhat if Marty is out sick?\n\n31\n00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,280\nIf he's out sick tomorrow,\n\n32\n00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,260\nI get all these sales emails coming in and\nnobody answers them all right.\n\n33\n00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,530\nSo that's not really a great option for\na shared email address.\n\n34\n00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,680\nInstead, we could use one of\nour admin console groups.\n\n35\n00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,200\nI can go back to my Dashboard and\ngo under More Controls>Groups.\n\n36\n00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,420\nAnd Groups is one of the ones that I\nalmost always pin to my admin console.\n\n37\n00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,880\nSo I'm gonna hit the little\nplus mark there to pin it.\n\n38\n00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,510\nThere we go.\nSo that way I don't have to go to\n\n39\n00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,900\nMore Controls every time.\n\n40\n00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,100\nBut I'll go into Groups and\nI can create a Group called ales, and\n\n41\n00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,320\nI can put multiple people in that group so\n\n42\n00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,640\nthey'll all get the emails that\ngo to sales, not just one person.\n\n43\n00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,940\nAnd that's really handy,\ncuz if I hire new people,\n\n44\n00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,970\nI can put them in the sales group or\ntake them out of the sales group.\n\n45\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,080\nDepending on whether or\nnot I want them to get those emails.\n\n46\n00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,600\nSo it works as a good way\nof setting permissions,\n\n47\n00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,130\nas well as a distribution list for email.\n\n48\n00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,620\nSo I'll just whip one up here real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,081\nI'm gonna call this my Sales group, and\n\n50\n00:02:56,081 --> 00:03:00,190\nI'll give it the email\naddress of sales@itprotv.net.\n\n51\n00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,320\nIf I wanted to have more\naddresses I can do that.\n\n52\n00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,720\nNot on this screen, but after\nthe group is created I can edit it and\n\n53\n00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,330\nyou aliases on a group just\nlike you do on a users.\n\n54\n00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,530\nSo I can add more aliases if you've\ngot more than one domain name, right?\n\n55\n00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,820\nDown here I can pick the access level and\n\n56\n00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,670\nthe access level this is kind of our level\nof permissions for the group itself.\n\n57\n00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,760\nYou'll see the default is team.\n\n58\n00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,650\nAnd that means that anyone that's in\nthis group can send emails to group.\n\n59\n00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,830\nThey can send an email and\nit'll go to all the other guys.\n\n60\n00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,980\nAnd they can also view the member list.\n\n61\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,810\nThey can see who's in the group.\n\n62\n00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,020\nAnd that's the default option.\n\n63\n00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,850\nWe want visibility inside\nof our organization.\n\n64\n00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,350\nAnother options, though,\nis announcement only.\n\n65\n00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:44,550\nAnd with announcement only, your members\nwill receive emails sent to the list,\n\n66\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,030\nbut they can't actually\nemail the list themselves.\n\n67\n00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,490\nThis is useful if you want,\nwell, announcements.\n\n68\n00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,770\nYou want your administrators to be able to\nsend messages out to the whole company.\n\n69\n00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,480\nBut you don't want everybody else in\nthe company to be able to use that\n\n70\n00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,810\naddress list.\n\n71\n00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,530\nAnd then there's restricted.\n\n72\n00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,540\nRestricted effectively\nmakes this list private, so\n\n73\n00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,710\nthat only members even know it exists.\n\n74\n00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,340\nAnd then the owners can email and post\nmessages into it, and go on from there.\n\n75\n00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,510\nSo the restricted ones are kind\nof private and hidden.\n\n76\n00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,430\nI'm gonna stick with team on this one,\nthough.\n\n77\n00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,500\nAnd you'll see, allow anyone on\nthe internet to post messages.\n\n78\n00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,660\nNotice that's not checked by default.\n\n79\n00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,750\nWhen you create a group,\nby default it's a distribution list for\n\n80\n00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,750\npeople inside of your organization and\nthat's it.\n\n81\n00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,530\nBut, if this is sales at ITProTV and\n\n82\n00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,160\nI want people on the internet\nto be able to email to it.\n\n83\n00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,820\nSo, I'll need to check that off so\nthat the general public can use it.\n\n84\n00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,420\nThen we've got add all users\nwithin ITProTV.net to this group.\n\n85\n00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,520\nThis is a really cool option.\n\n86\n00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,982\nRight now I don't want all\nof my users in this group.\n\n87\n00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:51,140\nIf somebody emails I just need\nit to go to the sales people.\n\n88\n00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,860\nBut if I was creating a more generic\ngroup, like an all employees group so\n\n89\n00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,990\nI could use it for\nannouncements to the company.\n\n90\n00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,770\nI might want to choose that so\nthat all current and new employees get\n\n91\n00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,820\nadded to this list so that when I send\nthe email out it will get to them.\n\n92\n00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,160\nWe actually use something\nlike that here at ITProTV.\n\n93\n00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,470\nI'm gonna hit create to turn this group on\nand then I'm gonna create one more group.\n\n94\n00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,550\nI'll just go right back up\nhere to create group and\n\n95\n00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,390\nI'm gonna call this one all employees.\n\n96\n00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,010\nAll right.\n\n97\n00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,370\nAnd I'll call this one\neveryone at ITProTV.net and\n\n98\n00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,630\ndown here I'm going to change\nthat to announcement only.\n\n99\n00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,480\nI don't want employees using this like,\nhey, I've got a refrigerator for sale,\n\n100\n00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,340\nanybody interested?\n\n101\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,680\nI don't want that kind of stuff going on.\n\n102\n00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,950\nSo, I'll set it to announcement only, so\n\n103\n00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,520\nthat only the owners of\nthis group can email to it.\n\n104\n00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,060\nAnd then I'll choose to add all\nusers within ITProTV.net to it.\n\n105\n00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,430\nNow any time I add new employees\nthey're going to automatically be\n\n106\n00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,780\npart of this list.\n\n107\n00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,615\nBut when I chose announcement only\nnotice that Internet option is gone.\n\n108\n00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:56,355\nI can't choose to allow the people\non the internet to email to it.\n\n109\n00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,665\nThat's not what this list would be used\nfor, so that's perfectly fine for me.\n\n110\n00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,705\nThere's one more warning down\nhere that says if groups for\n\n111\n00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,955\nbusiness is activated later,\nblah blah blah.\n\n112\n00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:07,135\nWhat's that talking about?\n\n113\n00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:08,735\nWell I'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n114\n00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,050\nRight now we'll work through with\nwhat are called Admin Console Groups.\n\n115\n00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,550\nGroups for\nbusiness are the other type of group.\n\n116\n00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,090\nThey're the really advanced group\nthat gives us a lot more features.\n\n117\n00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,350\nSo it's just letting me know that if\nwe set this, and we turn Groups for\n\n118\n00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,040\nbusiness on later, we'll be okay,\nthis group will actually be converted and\n\n119\n00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,010\nbrought into Groups for business.\n\n120\n00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,662\nI'll go ahead and hit create though and\nnow, I've got this other mailing list.\n\n121\n00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:35,980\nNow, these lists aren't very\nuseful just like they are.\n\n122\n00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,180\nWe typically need to go and\nadd some members to them.\n\n123\n00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,380\nSo, you'll see manage users,\nand we can go and\n\n124\n00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,960\nstart to add users in there,\nbased on what we need.\n\n125\n00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320\nRight?\nPeople are going to be owners or\n\n126\n00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,240\nmanagers and\npeople are just going to be inside of it.\n\n127\n00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,553\nAnd we'll see more of\nthat in another segment.\n\n128\n00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:55,297\nSome of the other things that we can do\nonce we're in here, well we create these\n\n129\n00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:58,532\ngroups, now we can go and\nstart sharing resources with the groups or\n\n130\n00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:02,433\nassigning permissions to areas, we can\nuse them as group filters for security.\n\n131\n00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,330\nThere's all sorts of stuff you can use\nwith the group Once they're created.\n\n132\n00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,090\nBut there are some things you can't do,\n\n133\n00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,200\nand unfortunately some of those things\nare right here in our exam objective.\n\n134\n00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,790\nFor example, I can't use one of these\nGroups as a shared mailbox, right.\n\n135\n00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,745\nThe objective said shared mailbox for\na group of users.\n\n136\n00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:20,825\nWell if I add more than one\nperson to that sales list, so\n\n137\n00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,105\nlet me go back to my sales list.\n\n138\n00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,515\nSo when I go to the sales list and\n\n139\n00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,875\nI go to manage users,\nthere's nobody in here right now.\n\n140\n00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,885\nI'll go and add some people, so I'm\ngonna add Marty, and I'll add Nick, and\n\n141\n00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,795\nI'll add Dave.\n\n142\n00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:37,095\nAll right, so\nI'm adding these three people.\n\n143\n00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,920\nThey're gonna be my sales people so\nI'm punching them right in there.\n\n144\n00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,380\nThey're now my sales people.\n\n145\n00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,590\nAnd I guess I should add David too,\nI don't wanna leave him out.\n\n146\n00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,470\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,600\nSo we got the good lineup.\n\n148\n00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,160\nSo we got them right in there,\nthey're gonna be my salespeople.\n\n149\n00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,872\nAnd I'm gonna add them as a member.\n\n150\n00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:51,604\nAll right.\n\n151\n00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,521\nSo that means if we send an email\nto sales@itprotv.net All four\n\n152\n00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:59,081\nof these guys are going to get it.\n\n153\n00:07:59,081 --> 00:07:59,732\nOkay.\n\n154\n00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,479\nAnd you'll see that they're all members.\n\n155\n00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,093\nNow, I might wanna make\nsomebody a manager,\n\n156\n00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:09,383\nso I might wanna add Marty in here as a,\nlike an owner.\n\n157\n00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:09,986\nAll right.\n\n158\n00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,700\nAnd that way, if I had this set for\nannouncements, it would go, shoot.\n\n159\n00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,350\nI've already got Marty right here,\nso I just have to edit him, or\n\n160\n00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,300\nI can just remove him.\n\n161\n00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,460\nOr I can set his role to owner,\nright there.\n\n162\n00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,540\nThere we go.\nAnd so now,\n\n163\n00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,900\nI've got Marty flagged as an owner.\n\n164\n00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,430\nSo if this was an announcement only list,\nMarty could now email to it.\n\n165\n00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,430\nBut otherwise, as members,\nthey can all receive the emails.\n\n166\n00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,320\nIf you were to send an email to\nsales@itprotv.net right now,\n\n167\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,150\nIt would go to all four of these users.\n\n168\n00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,710\nAll right.\nSo\n\n169\n00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,050\nit's kind of a shared mailbox, isn't it?\n\n170\n00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,110\nWell not really.\n\n171\n00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,750\nThere's two problems with\nthe way this is set up.\n\n172\n00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,250\nProblem number one is,\n\n173\n00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,330\nif David Ellison reads the email,\ndoes Dave Mustaine know that he read it?\n\n174\n00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,730\nNo, Marty, Nick,\n\n175\n00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,790\nnone of them know that the other person\nread it, because it's a distribution list.\n\n176\n00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,480\nThe email is being copied,\nto each of their in boxes, separately.\n\n177\n00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,450\nSo if one of them reads it,\nthe others don't know.\n\n178\n00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,120\nIt still shows as unread in their mailbox,\nbecause they haven't read it.\n\n179\n00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,400\nAnd when somebody replies, they're\nreplying from themselves, and so again,\n\n180\n00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200\nwe don't see that they've replied.\n\n181\n00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,410\nIt's not a true shared mailbox,\n\n182\n00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,750\nit's just really forwarding the email,\nand that's it.\n\n183\n00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,970\nSo not a whole heck of\na lot of power there.\n\n184\n00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,220\nAlso, if we want to set up\nsomething like a Q and A forum,\n\n185\n00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,510\nwhere somebody posts a question, and then\nthere's answers that people reply with,\n\n186\n00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,160\nwe like to be able to up vote,\ncorrect answers, and so on.\n\n187\n00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,370\nNone of that functionality is here.\n\n188\n00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,220\nThis is just email.\n\n189\n00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,940\nAll right.\n\n190\n00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,350\nWell if just email is all you need,\nthis is fine.\n\n191\n00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,270\nStick right here with\nthe admin console groups.\n\n192\n00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,172\nThey're super simple.\n\n193\n00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:45,356\nNone of that was very hard,\nand off you go, right?\n\n194\n00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:47,000\nReally cut and dry.\n\n195\n00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,220\nBut, if you want that advanced\nfunctionality, if you want them to have\n\n196\n00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,910\na shared mailbox, where they know when\nsomebody else has read the message, or\n\n197\n00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,230\nif somebody's replied to the message,\nwhere they can see all of that,\n\n198\n00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,080\nthe regular admin console\ngroups will not work for you.\n\n199\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,950\nWhat you'll need to do is, turn on what's\ncalled Google Groups for Business.\n\n200\n00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,910\nGoogle Groups for Business, is an add-on\nservice, that tacks on to Google Apps, and\n\n201\n00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,960\nit adds a ton of\nfunctionality to your groups.\n\n202\n00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,900\nAll right.\n\n203\n00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,850\nIt's just not on by default,\nbecause a lot of people don't need it.\n\n204\n00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,890\nIf you don't need it,\nwhy add that complexity,\n\n205\n00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,010\njust stick with the basic groups,\nand you're done.\n\n206\n00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,630\nAll right.\n\n207\n00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,910\nBut if we need it, we can go in, and\nturn it on, and then, sky's the limit.\n\n208\n00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,330\nWe have a lot of power\nwith what we wanna do.\n\n209\n00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:29,857\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:33,104\nThing about it is, when we turn\non Google Groups for Business,\n\n211\n00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,030\nit's not an immediate thing.\n\n212\n00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,980\nWhen we go and make the change,\nit'll give us a little message,\n\n213\n00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,420\nthat'll say it could take up to six hours,\nfor Google Groups for Business to set up.\n\n214\n00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,470\nAnd that's because it actually builds\na management site, specifically for\n\n215\n00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,560\nyour groups.\n\n216\n00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,270\nThe admin console here can just manage,\nwell, admin console groups,\n\n217\n00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,520\nthe groups right here.\n\n218\n00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,660\nBut when we do Group for Business, we get\na whole separate site for managing them,\n\n219\n00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,220\nand it's because of all\nthe options that we have.\n\n220\n00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,480\nSo it takes a little\nwhile to build that up.\n\n221\n00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,770\nSo if you're going to use this,\nyou need to turn it on early.\n\n222\n00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,320\nAnd on the exam, for those of you\nthat are going to take the exam for\n\n223\n00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,760\nthis, it needs to be one\nof the first things you do.\n\n224\n00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,050\nRemember, your exam is a two hour exam.\n\n225\n00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,800\nSo if you wait until the last\nminute to turn on Google Groups for\n\n226\n00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,700\nBusiness, it might not\nhave time to initialize.\n\n227\n00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,970\nSo you need to turn it on early.\n\n228\n00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,280\nNow, I said it could take up to six hours,\nwell, it doesn't normally take six hours.\n\n229\n00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,750\nIn fact, I usually find that it takes\nabout 15 minutes, 15-20 minutes,\n\n230\n00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,270\nright in that range.\n\n231\n00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,172\nBut you do need to turn it on early,\neither way.\n\n232\n00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,040\nAll right.\n\n233\n00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,010\nSo, I'm gonna go, and turn it on.\n\n234\n00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,550\nTo turn it on, what we do, is we go to\nGoogle Apps, so I'm on my admin console,\n\n235\n00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,420\nand I click on Google Apps.\n\n236\n00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,010\nAnd I'm gonna click on\nthe Add Services button up here,\n\n237\n00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,500\nthe little square with a plus on it.\n\n238\n00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,610\nAnd in the services that I can add,\n\n239\n00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,710\nright here at the top,\nyou'll see Groups for Business.\n\n240\n00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,649\nAnd see how it says,\nalready purchased services?\n\n241\n00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,640\nThey don't charge extra,\nfor Group for Business.\n\n242\n00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,250\nThe reason it's separated, is there\nused to be a free tier, for Google Apps.\n\n243\n00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,530\nYou could sign up for a free,\nwell originally, it was like 50 users, and\n\n244\n00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,440\nthen it dropped it to 10.\n\n245\n00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,410\nAnd so,\n\n246\n00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,500\nback when there was a free time, you had\nto pay to get Google Groups for Business.\n\n247\n00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,030\nBut now that they've eliminated\nthe free tier, everybody has it.\n\n248\n00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,830\nSo it'll always show as\nsomething that you've purchased.\n\n249\n00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,910\nAnd all you have to do is hit,\nadd it now, and\n\n250\n00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,962\nthat's going to turn on Google Groups for\nBusiness.\n\n251\n00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,250\nAll right.\n\n252\n00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,870\nSo it's telling me now that\nmy settings have been saved.\n\n253\n00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,460\nHow do I know it's on?\n\n254\n00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,940\nWell, if I go back to my dashboard,\nand I go into Google Apps,\n\n255\n00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,130\nI should now see Google Groups for\nBusiness, right there.\n\n256\n00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,550\nAnd it shows as, on for everyone.\n\n257\n00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,090\nIt's turned off my whole organization.\n\n258\n00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,190\nIt's there, and it's on.\n\n259\n00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,480\nBut like I said, just because it's there,\nit might not be ready yet.\n\n260\n00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320\nIt might take up to six hours, for the\ndedicated management site to work with it.\n\n261\n00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,730\nThat doesn't mean we can't do anything,\nthough.\n\n262\n00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,980\nYou can actually click on it, and\nstart to work with Groups for Business.\n\n263\n00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,410\nWhen I click on it, I'll get my basic\nsettings, and there's a few things that we\n\n264\n00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,880\ncan set in here,\nthat we do need to take care of early on.\n\n265\n00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,230\nWe've got our default sharing settings.\n\n266\n00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,230\nThose are something that we'll\nneed to jump in, and tweak with.\n\n267\n00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,980\nIf I go into my sharing settings, it's\ngonna take me into the advanced settings,\n\n268\n00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,010\nand it's gonna give me the URL for\nthe management site, for my groups.\n\n269\n00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,390\nRemember that separate site I\nmentioned we're gonna have?\n\n270\n00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,850\nThe default is, that it'll be\nwww.groups.google.com/a/whatever your\n\n271\n00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,275\ndomain name is.\n\n272\n00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,420\nRight?\nWhatever your parent\n\n273\n00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,750\norganization is called.\n\n274\n00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,245\nSo that's the URL, and it's building\nthat in the background, right now.\n\n275\n00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,805\nIt may not be ready yet, but\nit usually is pretty quickly.\n\n276\n00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:36,825\nYou can change that to something custom.\n\n277\n00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,533\nSo for example, you could make,\nor I could make,\n\n278\n00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:44,385\nwww.groups.ITProTV.net, if I wanted,\nusing C name records, on my DNS server.\n\n279\n00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:45,502\nBut the default is,\n\n280\n00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:50,253\nto just be www.groups.Google.com/a/,\nand then whatever your domain name is.\n\n281\n00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:54,740\nAll right.\n\n282\n00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,650\nSo if I go back into my sharing settings,\nI see that URL, and\n\n283\n00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,940\nI then I start to see some of the other\ndefaults, for Google Groups for Business.\n\n284\n00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,880\nFor example I see right here,\n\n285\n00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,120\nhow do I handle sharing with\npeople outside of the domain?\n\n286\n00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,000\nWhen we create a new group,\nwill it be public on the internet, or\n\n287\n00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,350\nwill it be private?\n\n288\n00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,970\nAnd the default for creating a new group,\nis to make it private.\n\n289\n00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,700\nAnd you generally want\nto leave it that way.\n\n290\n00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,290\nYour groups will be private, and you can\noverride this, on a per group basis.\n\n291\n00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,390\nSo when you want to make a public group,\nyou can flag it as public, but otherwise,\n\n292\n00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,160\nit'll be private, used internally to\nyour organization, and that's it.\n\n293\n00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,347\nAnd then down here, you can specify,\nwho's allowed to create groups.\n\n294\n00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:37,887\nAnyone on the entire internet,\nthat's a bad idea.\n\n295\n00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:41,865\n[LAUGH] Anyone in this domain, which is\nthe default, that's what we normally want.\n\n296\n00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:46,355\nOr you can even restrict that to, just\nthe administrators, inside of your domain.\n\n297\n00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,895\nThat would make it where a regular user,\nthat's an employee inside of your company,\n\n298\n00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,325\ncouldn't create their own group,\nand that may be desirable,\n\n299\n00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,445\nif you want to lock that down.\n\n300\n00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:58,575\nNow when somebody creates a group,\nit's gonna get an email address,\n\n301\n00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:02,120\nthat'll be the group name,\nat your domain name.\n\n302\n00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,950\nBut that can be a little\nconfusing sometimes, so\n\n303\n00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,800\nyou can choose to add a suffix.\n\n304\n00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,900\nLike I might choose to add,\n-group, to the end of it.\n\n305\n00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,310\nSo if I create a group called sales,\nthen it would be sales-group@ITProTV.net.\n\n306\n00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,820\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n307\n00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,070\nThat's an option,\njust to help you tell the difference,\n\n308\n00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,950\nbetween email addresses that are users,\nversus, email addresses that are groups.\n\n309\n00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,630\nThen beneath that, we see things\nlike member, and email access.\n\n310\n00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,940\nGroup owners can allow members\nfrom outside the domain, or\n\n311\n00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,000\ngroup owners can allow incoming email,\nfrom outside of this domain.\n\n312\n00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,340\nThis is how we handle people that\nare outside of our organization.\n\n313\n00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,930\nBy default, we can invite people inside\nour organization, to join the group.\n\n314\n00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,230\nBut if we want, we could turn this on, and\n\n315\n00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,420\nwe could bring in people from outside,\ntoo.\n\n316\n00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,362\nThat's really useful, if you've got\na group that's part of a project.\n\n317\n00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:51,458\nSo maybe, you've got some new project for\ndoing a web server roll out, and\n\n318\n00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,572\nmost of the members of that\ngroup are internal, but\n\n319\n00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:56,794\nyou've got some external contractors,\nthat are a part of that project too.\n\n320\n00:15:56,794 --> 00:16:00,877\nYou might want to invite them in and\nyou need to turn this option on for this.\n\n321\n00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,339\nNow remember, this is the default for\ngroups I create,\n\n322\n00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,480\nI could override this on a per group\nbasis which is usually better.\n\n323\n00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,020\nAnd then we've got our group visibility,\nby default when we create groups\n\n324\n00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,890\nthey should show up in a group directory\nso that our end users can find them.\n\n325\n00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,730\nWith a admin console group,\nan administrator has to add people or\n\n326\n00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,270\nremove them, or the owner of that group\ncan do it but with Google Groups for\n\n327\n00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,110\nBusiness, we can create\ngroups that are self-service.\n\n328\n00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,320\nIn other words, end users can choose\nto join the group if they want to.\n\n329\n00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,615\nSo, if I've got a group\ncalled Charity Announcements,\n\n330\n00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:38,510\nthen I might make that optional for\nmy employees.\n\n331\n00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,148\nIf they want to join up to the charity\nannouncement group they can, and they'll\n\n332\n00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:45,838\nget those announcements and if they don't\nwant to they can not be a part of it and,\n\n333\n00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,200\nbah humbug and all of that,\nand not be in the group.\n\n334\n00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,017\nSo if you want to set that\nup you can choose it but\n\n335\n00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,740\nyou wouldn't want to hide your groups.\n\n336\n00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,670\nBut you can choose right\nhere to change it.\n\n337\n00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,470\nGroup owners can hide groups and\nhide newly created groups.\n\n338\n00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,110\nThose are the defaults, and\nthey can be overridden per group.\n\n339\n00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,680\nAnd the last option I see is\nuninstall groups for business.\n\n340\n00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,170\nIf I was using admin console groups, and\nthen I converted over to Google Groups for\n\n341\n00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,690\nBusiness, I can go back again and you use\nthis uninstall and that removes all of\n\n342\n00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,000\nGoogle Groups for Business addons and it\nputs you back in just the regular groups.\n\n343\n00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,740\nRemember that your regular groups,\nthey're getting converted right now.\n\n344\n00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,780\nThey're getting converted into\nGoogle Groups for Business groups.\n\n345\n00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,220\nAll right, so I stalled a little bit.\n\n346\n00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,330\nLet's see if this URL is working for me.\n\n347\n00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,479\nI'm gonna go ahead and browse to it.\n\n348\n00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,090\nIt's only been about five minutes,\n\n349\n00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,000\nI don't think it's been quite,\nwell actually it does seem to be there.\n\n350\n00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,020\nAlright so I've logged into that URL,\nso here I am on my groups page, and\n\n351\n00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,040\nif I go to my groups I'll see the groups\ninside of my organization and\n\n352\n00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,260\nI guess it's not done yet,\nI don't see any of my existing groups yet.\n\n353\n00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,760\nRemember I had that sales group, and\nsome of the other ones that we made,\n\n354\n00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,780\nI'm not seeing those yet, but I am able to\nlog in to start to create new groups, so\n\n355\n00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,800\nthis is the Google Groups for\nBusiness screen.\n\n356\n00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,670\nAnd when we create a group here it's very\nsimilar to creating groups in the admin\n\n357\n00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,160\nconsole you hit, Create Group, and you\ngive it a group name and an email address.\n\n358\n00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,650\nRight, just like we saw.\n\n359\n00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,540\nThe big difference is we'll have a lot of\nother options down here that we can tweak.\n\n360\n00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,630\nGoogle Groups for\nBusiness is all about power.\n\n361\n00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,100\nWe've got a lot more power here than\nwe do on normal admin console groups.\n\n362\n00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,310\nSo maybe I wanna create a group for\nmy marketing department.\n\n363\n00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,390\nSo I'll call this Marketing.\n\n364\n00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,940\nAll right and this is gonna be\nMarketing at ITproTV.net and\n\n365\n00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,460\nI'm typing a description.\n\n366\n00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,180\nThe primary language for the group and\n\n367\n00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,110\nthen I can specify the group type,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,150\nFor this group type, I can specify what\nit's gonna be and the default is an email\n\n369\n00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,920\nlist but if you drop that down,\nyou'll see where I can do a forum.\n\n370\n00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,580\nRight, just like a web based forum or\na Q and A.\n\n371\n00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,240\nPeople post questions and we answer and\nupload or download the results.\n\n372\n00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,340\nThat's really useful if you're\ndoing something like a helpdesk.\n\n373\n00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,440\nRight, let's make this a helpdesk instead.\n\n374\n00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,400\nI'm going to create a helpdesk group,\nright, and\n\n375\n00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,060\nI'll just call it helpdesk@itprotv.net.\n\n376\n00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,950\nSo when my employees have a problem,\n\n377\n00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,120\nthey can shoot an email\nto helpdesk@itprotv.net.\n\n378\n00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200\nHey, I can't get this to work,\nwhat's going on?\n\n379\n00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,660\nAnd then the help desk, and\nother employees can post answers.\n\n380\n00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,710\nAnd the answer that's right can get\nup-voted and people can see that.\n\n381\n00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,622\nI may want this, now this is gonna be\nan internal only group I wouldn't want\n\n382\n00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:32,685\nthe the outside world to see it,\nor maybe I would, right?\n\n383\n00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,785\nMaybe I want my customers to\nbe able to interact this way.\n\n384\n00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:37,735\nI've got that flexibility.\n\n385\n00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,185\nSo I'm gonna choose to make this a Q and\nA forum, and\n\n386\n00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,915\nthey give you little descriptions\nhere of what you're doing, but\n\n387\n00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:48,300\nsee how with a Q and A forum, topics can\nbe marked as resolved or rated by users.\n\n388\n00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,110\nThat's well beyond normal\nemail functionality, right?\n\n389\n00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,186\nYou don't have that with an email\ndistribution list, but with the Q and\n\n390\n00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:54,910\nA forum, we do.\n\n391\n00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,200\nThen we can choose who's allowed to\nview topics, who's allowed to post, and\n\n392\n00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,890\nwho's allowed to join.\n\n393\n00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,550\nWell, for viewing topics, if I want this\nto be internal for my organization that's\n\n394\n00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,160\nwhat I want, I want people in the group\nand people in my organization to do it.\n\n395\n00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200\nAnd that's actually the default,\n\n396\n00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,330\nsee how it says all members of\nthe group and all organization members.\n\n397\n00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,200\nBut you can pick and choose managers, all\nmembers, owners of the group, and so on.\n\n398\n00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,720\nSo you can add or\nremove check marks based on what you want.\n\n399\n00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,948\nAs far as who's allowed to post, I pretty\nmuch want anybody to be able to post.\n\n400\n00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:29,980\nThat's fine, right, all members\nof the group and organizations.\n\n401\n00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,120\nBut then as far as joining the group I\nmight not want that to be everybody.\n\n402\n00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,420\nRight, I might want to limit that\ndown to only invited users and\n\n403\n00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,860\nthen I just invite my help desk employees.\n\n404\n00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,670\nSo I want them to be in there managing and\nposting.\n\n405\n00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,070\nOther people can post a question, but\nthey wont be able to post answers.\n\n406\n00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,740\nSo it's up to me how I wanna go about that\nand we can change it to meet our needs.\n\n407\n00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,150\nYou can even make it public, where\nanyone can go in and join the group and\n\n408\n00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,660\nthen start to participate.\n\n409\n00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,170\nSo that's another great thing that we can\ndo and we don't see on these screens,\n\n410\n00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,540\nwe'll see it later, but\nyou can turn on things like moderation,\n\n411\n00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,980\nwhere when somebody posts, the post\ndoesn't immediately go into the forum.\n\n412\n00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,280\nIt goes to moderation and\nan administrator has to approve the post.\n\n413\n00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,780\nThat's a great way to cut back on\njunk making it into your forums.\n\n414\n00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:21,500\nAll right so those are the settings\nwe provide to create this group.\n\n415\n00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,840\nAnd then when we hit Create\nnow we've got the group,\n\n416\n00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,030\nand apparently the email was taken,\noh, I must've clicked twice.\n\n417\n00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,090\nSo now that it's created, it's\ntelling me I can invite people over or\n\n418\n00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,810\nI can customize the group setting.\n\n419\n00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,890\nThere's a lot more options in here that\nI can customize but I'll just hit okay.\n\n420\n00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,070\nI've now got this\nHelp Desk group in place.\n\n421\n00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,390\nSo what I'm viewing now is kind\nof like that shared mailbox.\n\n422\n00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,240\nIf my end users start logging into\nthis if one person has marked\n\n423\n00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,020\nthe messages read and replied we're going\nto see that it's already been replied to.\n\n424\n00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,710\nNow we've got that collaborative aspect.\n\n425\n00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,230\nI chose the Q&A format, so I see Post\nQuestion, but if I had chosen email list,\n\n426\n00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,390\nthen I would see Post a Message,\nand I could post messages to it, or\n\n427\n00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,400\nif we had chosen the forum one, we'd see\nPost a Topic, so it does change based on\n\n428\n00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,050\nthe type of group we picked, and\nyou can change it after the fact, too.\n\n429\n00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,400\nWhen you create a group,\nyou've got this Manage link right here.\n\n430\n00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,480\nYou've got Members also, right,\nthat's how we can control the membership.\n\n431\n00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720\nBut you've got Manage, and\nthat's where you can go in and\n\n432\n00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,050\nstart to change exactly\nwhat that group is.\n\n433\n00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,350\nAnd you got a ton of options in here as\nfar as manipulating what that group does.\n\n434\n00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,180\nIf I go under Information and\nGeneral Information,\n\n435\n00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,610\nyou'll see Topic types right here and\nmine's set to questions and\n\n436\n00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,580\nI can change that to discussions if I want\nit to be email or forum based, right?\n\n437\n00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,493\nSo I can manipulate\nthat value right there.\n\n438\n00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:50,690\nAll right, so\nthat's quite a lot of stuff but\n\n439\n00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,178\nthis is what they're talking\nabout in the objectives.\n\n440\n00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:57,651\nSo when they say on the exam, you need to\nknow how to Create a group that can be\n\n441\n00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:01,569\nused as a shared mailbox or\nused as a Q and A, or used as a web forum.\n\n442\n00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:05,361\nWhat their talking about is you need\nto know how to enable Google Groups for\n\n443\n00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:07,807\nBusiness and\ncreate a group in Google Groups for\n\n444\n00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:12,113\nbusiness that then falls into one of those\npatterns, it's super powerful stuff.\n\n445\n00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:15,930\nThere are times even with a regular\nemail list that you'll still wanna use\n\n446\n00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,811\nGoogle Groups for Business I'll show\nsome examples in another segment but\n\n447\n00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,800\nmany people take advantage of this.\n\n448\n00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,410\nWe use it quite a bit here at ITProTV, and\nI know that you guys out there will too.\n\n449\n00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,050\nSo, in this segment, we got to see regular\nadmin console groups, and how they work,\n\n450\n00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,380\nand what their limitations were and we\ngot to see Google Groups for Business and\n\n451\n00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,850\na brief glimpse at all\nthe power that they provide.\n\n452\n00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,842\nSo, really cool stuff.\n\n453\n00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:42,052\nHope you guys enjoyed that segment,\nI'll see you in the next one.\n\n454\n00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:50,000\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16,280\nAnd it sets the record for\nthe longest name of an objective.\n\n4\n00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,580\nit's demonstrate how to add, edit,\ndisable, and delete a group.\n\n5\n00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,190\nAnd prevent users from seeing\nother members of the group, and\n\n6\n00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,240\nadminister group roles.\n\n7\n00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560\nIt's really just all about groups.\n\n8\n00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,270\nWhen you create a group,\nyou start putting your members in there.\n\n9\n00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,230\nAnd they're ready to use right away.\n\n10\n00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,560\nAnd the default configuration of that\ngroup might be perfectly adequate for\n\n11\n00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,350\nyour company's needs, but the real\npower of Google Groups for Business.\n\n12\n00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,880\nIs that we have a ton of additional\nfeatures that we can configure.\n\n13\n00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320\nWe've some of those already in\nthe other segments that we filmed.\n\n14\n00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160\nBut there's a few that we\nhaven't really touched on yet.\n\n15\n00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800\nSo we wanna take a look\nat those right here.\n\n16\n00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,140\nSo let's start from the beginning.\n\n17\n00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,160\nHow do I create a group?\n\n18\n00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,420\nWell, groups are pretty easy to create.\n\n19\n00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,240\nWe log into our administrative console.\n\n20\n00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,450\nAnd from here you might\nhave pinned groups.\n\n21\n00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,450\nLet me go ahead and just remove that.\n\n22\n00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,235\nLet's say that we haven't.\n\n23\n00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:10,960\n.Right, so for a brand new account, when\nyou log in you'll go to more controls.\n\n24\n00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880\nAnd you'll see groups right there.\n\n25\n00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,020\nNow for me I go to groups so often,\nthat I usually pin it to my admin console.\n\n26\n00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,270\nSo I'll hit that little plus sign\nabove the pin groups up here.\n\n27\n00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,610\nJust so I don't have to go\nto more controls every time.\n\n28\n00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,560\nYou know,\nit's call customizable to fit your needs.\n\n29\n00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,280\nSo I'll go into Google Groups.\n\n30\n00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,840\nAnd here I'm seeing my groups.\n\n31\n00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,700\nNow if I haven't turned on\nGoogle Groups for Business.\n\n32\n00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,660\nThen what I'm seeing are just admin\nconsole groups and that's it.\n\n33\n00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,940\nThose are the ones that are used for\nmailing lists, and\n\n34\n00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,000\nused for permissions assignment.\n\n35\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,270\nBut if I've turned on Google Groups for\n\n36\n00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,580\nBusiness, now I get all\nthe extra features.\n\n37\n00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,740\nSo, what I see here in the admin\nconsole is actually somewhat limited.\n\n38\n00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,740\nIt's real easy to spot when you've got\nGoogle Groups for Business turned on.\n\n39\n00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,410\nBecause over here you'll\nhave a type column.\n\n40\n00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,490\nSo you can see,\nlike I've got an announcement group.\n\n41\n00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,920\nAnd a team group.\n\n42\n00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,620\nAnd these are things that we wouldn't\nnormally have without a Google Groups\n\n43\n00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,280\nfor Business.\n\n44\n00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,860\nBut I can take any of my groups and\nedit them.\n\n45\n00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,710\nIf I want to create a new group though,\nI just use the button up here.\n\n46\n00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,210\nIt's three people and a plus sign\nthat we can use to create a group and\n\n47\n00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,970\nspecify some basic information\nto get that group created.\n\n48\n00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,700\nThe first thing we need is a name.\n\n49\n00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,520\nSo I've got to think about what it is\nthat I'm trying to create a group for.\n\n50\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,400\nMaybe I've got an accounting department.\n\n51\n00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,240\nAnd so I want the accountants to have\na mailing list that I can use to easily\n\n52\n00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,830\ncontact each of them.\n\n53\n00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,950\nSo I'm going to create\nan accounting department group.\n\n54\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,740\nAnd I'll give it an email address\nof accounting@itprotv.net.\n\n55\n00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,760\nYou can put in a description of what\nits used for, but that's optional.\n\n56\n00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,970\nAfter that we've got the access level.\n\n57\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,250\nIf this is just going to be an internal\nmailing, list I can drop that down.\n\n58\n00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,780\nAnd I can choose to make\nit a team mailing list.\n\n59\n00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,120\nSo that it will just be used internally.\n\n60\n00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,630\nOr I can choose public, which means\nanyone in the entire world can do it.\n\n61\n00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,228\nIf I wanna put on my website, hey,\nhave a problem with your bill?\n\n62\n00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:03,010\nPlease email accounting@itprotv.net.\n\n63\n00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,230\nThat's the kind of thing I would need to\nmake available to the internet as a whole.\n\n64\n00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,900\nAnybody out there can\nshoot an email to it.\n\n65\n00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,780\nBut that may not be what I want.\n\n66\n00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,840\nInstead I can choose Team, and now it's\nlimited to inside of my organization.\n\n67\n00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280\nWhoever is the owner or\n\n68\n00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200\nmanager of that group can invite\npeople to participate in it.\n\n69\n00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,070\nBut really anybody can join, and post to\nit that's inside of your organization.\n\n70\n00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,500\nSo it's an internal mailing list.\n\n71\n00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,590\nAlso keep in mind that this is the screen\nthat's gonna create the group.\n\n72\n00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,760\nOnce the group is created I\ncan come back and change this.\n\n73\n00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,070\nSo this isn't set in stone, we've got\nwhere we can modify it after the fact.\n\n74\n00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,220\nWe also have announcement only.\n\n75\n00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,830\nAnnouncement only is a neat one.\n\n76\n00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,310\nWith announcement only, only the manager\nor owner of the group can post to it.\n\n77\n00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,070\nSo they can send stuff to it.\n\n78\n00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,970\nAnd then it's sent out all the people\nthat are a part of that group.\n\n79\n00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,940\nSo your members are in\na receive only type mode.\n\n80\n00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,210\nThey're not able to post.\n\n81\n00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,560\nOnly owners and managers.\n\n82\n00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,750\nThat's great for\ndoing system status updates, or\n\n83\n00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,690\nhaving email lists you wanna control.\n\n84\n00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,100\nTo limit who's able to post it.\n\n85\n00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,400\nAnd then lastly we have restricted.\n\n86\n00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,280\nRestricted is where we hide the list.\n\n87\n00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,090\nWe actually hide this group from\nthe directory so employees can't find it.\n\n88\n00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,640\nAnd the only people that can use it,\nare the ones who are members.\n\n89\n00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,690\nAnd the owner or manager of that group,\ncan invite new members to be a part of it.\n\n90\n00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,550\nBut employees can't just\njoin it on their own.\n\n91\n00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,350\nFor all intents and purposes,\nit's a hidden group.\n\n92\n00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,050\nSo, we pick which one we want.\n\n93\n00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,420\nI'm doing a counting, and\nI want that to be an internal one.\n\n94\n00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,960\nSo I'm gonna choose to do a team.\n\n95\n00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,650\nAnd then we can specify who\nwe want to deal with it.\n\n96\n00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,290\nWe've got also allow anyone on\nthe Internet to post messages.\n\n97\n00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,560\nIf I want people on the Internet to be\nable to send to it I can check that off.\n\n98\n00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,130\nI don't, so\nI'm gonna leave that unchecked.\n\n99\n00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,450\nAnd then we've got add all users\nwith itprotv.net to this group.\n\n100\n00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,140\nIf I was creating some kind of like\nuniversal list that encompassed all of my\n\n101\n00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,790\nemployees, I would check that.\n\n102\n00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,580\nAgain, for me,\nthis is just the accounting department.\n\n103\n00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,670\nSo I don't want to do that.\n\n104\n00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,470\nI'll go ahead and hit create, and\nit's going to build that group.\n\n105\n00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,060\nNow those screens are a little\nbit different than the old admin\n\n106\n00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,590\nconsole groups, but not too much.\n\n107\n00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,880\nYou're really just specifying a name and\ncreating.\n\n108\n00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,520\nOnce it's done we have some limited\nsettings right in here for the group.\n\n109\n00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,690\nSo you'll see where we can\nmanage the users in the group.\n\n110\n00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,350\nSo we can add people to it or\ntake people out.\n\n111\n00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,040\nAnd you'll typically want to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,240\nYou'll normally designate\nat least one owner.\n\n113\n00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,400\nSomeone who can manage that list.\n\n114\n00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,220\nAnd then you'll designate other members.\n\n115\n00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,450\nPeople who might be in your\naccounting department.\n\n116\n00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,280\nSo for add new members here,\nI might add myself.\n\n117\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,480\nAll right, and I'm a super admin so\nI don't necessarily need to add myself.\n\n118\n00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,620\nBut if I have non administrative\naccount that I use also,\n\n119\n00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,190\nI might wanna put that in here.\n\n120\n00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,500\nAnd so I'm gonna add myself as an owner.\n\n121\n00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,040\nWhich will allow me to post to it,\nand invite new people.\n\n122\n00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,570\nSo I'll just get myself added.\n\n123\n00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,760\nAnd then I can add any other\nemployees that we need.\n\n124\n00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,540\nSo maybe I'll add Chris Poland.\n\n125\n00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,160\nSo I'll pick him.\n\n126\n00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,010\nAnd I'm gonna add him as a member.\n\n127\n00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,020\nSo he's gonna be in my\naccounting department.\n\n128\n00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,330\nAnd when I shoot emails to this list,\nI want him to be able to get it.\n\n129\n00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,910\nAll right.\n\n130\n00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,350\nSo now I've got me as an owner, and\n\n131\n00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,739\nChris as a member,\nright there in the address list.\n\n132\n00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:12,690\nAll right.\n\n133\n00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,010\nSome of the other things that\nwe can adjust here on the group.\n\n134\n00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,670\nWe've got access settings.\n\n135\n00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,360\nWhen you go into access settings,\n\n136\n00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,450\nnotice how it launches\nan entirely separate window.\n\n137\n00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,380\nSo it's not just settings\nright here in the screen.\n\n138\n00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,320\nNormally, you'd expect something on\nthe right side of the screen to appear.\n\n139\n00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,172\nHere, it jumps over to\nthe Google Groups service.\n\n140\n00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,180\nGoogle Groups for\nBusiness adds so many features,\n\n141\n00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,910\nthat they actually give you\na dedicated site to manage it.\n\n142\n00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,490\nAnd I can see that up here on our URL.\n\n143\n00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,330\nThat's groups.google.com/a/ and\nthen your domain name, alright.\n\n144\n00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,500\nSo, when working with the groups, I could\nbypass the admin console all together.\n\n145\n00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,210\nAnd just come right here\nto manage my groups.\n\n146\n00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,640\nComing this way though, coming through\nthe admin console, is really easy for\n\n147\n00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,830\nmanaging groups that you're a member of.\n\n148\n00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,370\nIf you're not a member of a group,\nthen you won't see it in the group list.\n\n149\n00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,820\nFor example, let me show you.\n\n150\n00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,470\nI'll go back here to Groups, and\nI'm gonna create a new group.\n\n151\n00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,239\nAnd maybe this will be my executives.\n\n152\n00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,300\nGroup.\nRight, so all of the CEO, and\n\n153\n00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,990\npeople like that are going to be in here.\n\n154\n00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,560\nSo this is going to be my executives.\n\n155\n00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,300\nAnd I'll make that a team group.\n\n156\n00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,410\nAlright, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n157\n00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,650\ncreate it and I'll put people in here\nwho are executives in the company.\n\n158\n00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,280\nSo let's say that that Dave Mustaine\nis our main executive.\n\n159\n00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,980\nSo I'm gonna add him in,\nand put him in this group.\n\n160\n00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,860\nI'll make him an owner, too.\n\n161\n00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,490\nWhy not?\n\n162\n00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,550\nI'll go crazy.\n\n163\n00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,230\nOkay.\n\n164\n00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,520\nSo I've got this group called Executives.\n\n165\n00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,820\nIt's got an owner, it's Dave Mustaine.\n\n166\n00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,840\nHe can add whoever else he wants to it.\n\n167\n00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,560\nThe group is in place.\n\n168\n00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,659\nAs a super admin,\nif I browse to the Google Groups for\n\n169\n00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,357\nBusiness Management page.\n\n170\n00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:56,030\nIf I go to\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/itprotv.net.\n\n171\n00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,573\nThat's the page they created dedicated for\nmy group management.\n\n172\n00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:03,283\nWhen I browse to that, I'm gonna see this\nscreen and I can go to My groups, and\n\n173\n00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,860\nwhen I go to My groups,\nI'll see a bunch of groups.\n\n174\n00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,330\nNotice how I don't see the Executives\ngroup and the reason is, I'm not in it.\n\n175\n00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,210\nI'm not a member of that.\n\n176\n00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,930\nWhen we say My groups, that means groups\nthat you're actually a member of, and\n\n177\n00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,910\nI'm not a member of the Executives group.\n\n178\n00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,850\nSo as a super admin does\nthat mean I've lost control?\n\n179\n00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,460\nNo, I can still modify that group.\n\n180\n00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,130\nJust because I don't see it here,\nthat just means I'm not a member.\n\n181\n00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,280\nI can go back to my Admin consoel,\nand when I go the Groups page,\n\n182\n00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,500\nI can pick any of these groups, even ones\nthat I'm not a member of, like Executives.\n\n183\n00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,540\nWhen I click on that one, you can go\ninto your options, and as we go into\n\n184\n00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,770\nthe options you'll see a link appear\nup here to view in groups service, and\n\n185\n00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,770\nwhen you click on that,\nit'll open up that specific group.\n\n186\n00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,470\nI'm now editing the Executives group,\neven though I'm not a member of it.\n\n187\n00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,470\nHere it is,\nI see any posts that have been made to it,\n\n188\n00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,760\nI can change the members right here,\nand I can manage the options.\n\n189\n00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,210\nSo just because you're not in the group\ndoesn't mean you can't manage it.\n\n190\n00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,310\nAnd so I can go to Members, and I'll see\nthere's Dave Mustaine right there, and\n\n191\n00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,490\nwe can go in and\nadjust that if we need to.\n\n192\n00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,520\nWe've got the Manage button to go and\nconfigure that.\n\n193\n00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,240\nAnd so we've got that ability even\nthough we are not a member, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,010\nSo creating a group, getting it put in\nplace, that's pretty straightforward.\n\n195\n00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,950\nThe admin console is just a little\nlimited for us, there's only so\n\n196\n00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,050\nmuch that we can do here.\n\n197\n00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,550\nAll right, if we wanna modify a group, we\ncan go to our Main Groups admin page like\n\n198\n00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,190\nwe just saw, that's easy enough to knock\nthat out, so not a terrible burden there.\n\n199\n00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,565\nWe can edit settings and change the way\nthat it works, we don't have a lot of\n\n200\n00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:47,070\noptions here, but back in our screens on\nour actual Google Groups admin page, if I\n\n201\n00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,620\npick something like, Help Desk, notice how\nthere's this little manage link beside it.\n\n202\n00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,680\nWhen you go to the Manage page, that's\nwhere you get all of the options for\n\n203\n00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,710\nthat group.\n\n204\n00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,690\nAnd those settings that we specified when\nwe created the group, remember how I said\n\n205\n00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,860\nwe can change those after the fact,\nwell you can, they're all right here.\n\n206\n00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,710\nIf I go down here to information and\ngeneral information, right under here I'm\n\n207\n00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,930\ngoing to see most of the screens that\nit asked me when I created the group.\n\n208\n00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,520\nAnd I'll see where we can specify\nthings like Posting options,\n\n209\n00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,080\nwhether we allow posting by email or only\npostings via the website, whether it's\n\n210\n00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,570\na Q&A forum or a discussion forum,\nwe can start to change information there.\n\n211\n00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,220\nYou'll see other settings in here that all\nrelate to how that access is controlled\n\n212\n00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,300\nand how that group works.\n\n213\n00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,592\nSo a lot of this can be\nchanged after the fact.\n\n214\n00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:39,020\nAll right, let's see, what other\nthings do we need to look at here?\n\n215\n00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,290\nFor the most part, I usually just\nbypass the admin console and\n\n216\n00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,270\ndo all of my work right here\nfrom the Groups admin screen.\n\n217\n00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,120\nThat Groups admin URL is easy for\nme to remember just because\n\n218\n00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,655\nI've seen it so many times, but\nyour end users might not remember that\n\n219\n00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:59,490\ngroups.google.com/a/whatever, so\nyou can actually change that.\n\n220\n00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,545\nBack in your admin console,\nwhen we're on that Main groups page,\n\n221\n00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:07,830\nwe're in our group settings here.\n\n222\n00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,970\nWe look at our different groups, and if\nwe go in and edit one of these things, so\n\n223\n00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,170\nI'll go into like accounting department,\nyou'll see just these email addresses,\n\n224\n00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,320\nyou really don't see any\nmention of the URL itself.\n\n225\n00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,820\nAnd that's because it's actually\nmanaged in a slightly different place.\n\n226\n00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,840\nIf we go back to our admin dashboard,\nthe Groups dashboard part, that's just for\n\n227\n00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,650\nmanaging the groups themselves.\n\n228\n00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,080\nBut the Google Groups for\n\n229\n00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,540\nBusiness settings are stuck\nup here under Google Apps.\n\n230\n00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,710\nIf we go under Google Apps,\nyou'll find Groups for Business, and\n\n231\n00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,100\ninside of Groups for\nBusiness, there's that URL.\n\n232\n00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,470\nIf I float over it, I can hit Edit and\nthat will let me change that URL.\n\n233\n00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,630\nAnd something very common that\nwe do is to set a C name in DNS\n\n234\n00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,240\nto point it to like groups dot and\nthen whatever your domain name is.\n\n235\n00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,470\nThat's a lot easier for people to remember\nor you can it to forums dot itprotv.net or\n\n236\n00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,870\nwhatever it is that you need, and\nnow people have an easier URL to remember.\n\n237\n00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,700\nAnd as an administrator, instead of\nlogging into this console first and\n\n238\n00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,540\nthen jumping over to groups you can go\nstraight to groups to manage your systems.\n\n239\n00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,760\nAll right,\nsome of the other things that we may do,\n\n240\n00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,500\nwe may want to control access to\nthe group, control membership.\n\n241\n00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,180\nWell, I showed you controlling membership\nright here in the admin console, but\n\n242\n00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,520\nwe can control membership\nover in Google groups also.\n\n243\n00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,350\nIf I take a group and\nlet me just back up a bit here.\n\n244\n00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,060\nSo if I go into My groups and\nI see the groups that are listed and\n\n245\n00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,150\nI take a group like\nthe Accounting Department.\n\n246\n00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,570\nWhen you click on the Accounting\nDepartment, you're seeing the actual\n\n247\n00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,510\nAccounting Department group and\nup top you've got Manage and Members.\n\n248\n00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,220\nInside of members is where you\ncan control who is a member.\n\n249\n00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,390\nSo I can see in here that I've got\nChris Poland and myself and so I see\n\n250\n00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,190\nthose members that are there, but notice\nthat I don't have an add button up here.\n\n251\n00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,600\nIf I go up top I've got My settings and\nso on, so I've got a couple of\n\n252\n00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,020\ndifferent values in here, but\nI don't see the Add a Subscriber.\n\n253\n00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,700\nIf we click on that little person in\nthe gear, you'll have membership and\n\n254\n00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,970\nemail settings, but when you go in there,\nit's actually adjusting your settings and\n\n255\n00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,810\nhaving the ability to invite yourself,\nwhich is not terribly helpful.\n\n256\n00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,650\nWell, it's not helpful in this situation,\nit's got its own purposes.\n\n257\n00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,180\nSo if we wanna start adjusting\nour memberships in here,\n\n258\n00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,320\nwe can't really add\npeople from this screen.\n\n259\n00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,000\nThat's where we'd need to go\nback to the admin console, but\n\n260\n00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,830\nwhat we can tweak are the permissions\nthat people have.\n\n261\n00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,140\nWhen we go to our manage screen,\nyou'll see on the left in all the lists,\n\n262\n00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,330\nwe've got all members and right here,\nI've got those members listed again.\n\n263\n00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,100\nSo I see them, here's the members that\nare present, but down a little bit lower,\n\n264\n00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,680\nI'll see permissions, and here's where we\ncontrol the type of access people have.\n\n265\n00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920\nFrom basic permissions,\n\n266\n00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,960\nto who can post, who can moderate and\ngeneral access permissions.\n\n267\n00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,470\nThis is one of the screens that we see\nwhen we do an initial group set up, and\n\n268\n00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,940\nwe can pick and\nchoose what type of access people have.\n\n269\n00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,250\nFirst off we can see things like,\nwho can view the members,\n\n270\n00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,400\nwho can expand the list of people\nthat are in that group, and\n\n271\n00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,050\nthe default is, all members of the group,\nand all organization members.\n\n272\n00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,970\nBut if you're supporting external users,\nyou probably don't want members of\n\n273\n00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,570\nthe group to be able to see\neverybody else's email address.\n\n274\n00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,530\nThat's probably not something you want,\nso, we may need to turn that off.\n\n275\n00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,620\nAnd so, you can drop that box down\nthat says Select groups of users and\n\n276\n00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,560\nyou can come in and adjust that, and\n\n277\n00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,260\nremove things like All members and\nAll organization members.\n\n278\n00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,250\nBy taking that out, now,\nonly the owner of the group or\n\n279\n00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,280\na manager of the group will\nbe able to see who's in it.\n\n280\n00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,080\nPeople will still be able to use it,\nthey'll be able to post to it, but\n\n281\n00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,840\nthey won't be able to just pull\nup a list of who is a member.\n\n282\n00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,060\nThat's an example of access control that\nwe might wanna perform on a list, and\n\n283\n00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,780\nthat's a very common option right there.\n\n284\n00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,210\nYou've got the same thing down here for\nView Member Email Addresses.\n\n285\n00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,035\nThis one's just the members themselves,\nthis one's their email address, and\n\n286\n00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:09,030\nthe email address one does default\nto owners of the group, and\n\n287\n00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,370\nthat may be fine for us.\n\n288\n00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,990\nWe might want to add in managers also so\nthey can see it, it's up to you.\n\n289\n00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,200\nView topics we're normally\na little more loose with.\n\n290\n00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,140\nWe want people to be able to view the list\notherwise there's no point in having it.\n\n291\n00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,930\nSo we'll either limit\nthat to just members, so\n\n292\n00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,630\nif you're a member of the list\nyou can view all the topics.\n\n293\n00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,300\nOr you might wanna loosen that up even\nfurther and you can change this to,\n\n294\n00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,190\nlike, a public list where\neverybody can see it.\n\n295\n00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,890\nWe don't make it public here,\nwe do that back on the basic permissions.\n\n296\n00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,690\nAnd, oh, I haven't saved my settings.\n\n297\n00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,190\nBut basically we just customize\nthese to meet the needs of my list.\n\n298\n00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,870\nEverybody's needs are a little\nbit different, so\n\n299\n00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,050\nyou kind of have to pick and choose.\n\n300\n00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,787\nAnd we'll revisit these permissions\nagain because we have another\n\n301\n00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:55,273\nobjective that focuses specifically\non the permission side.\n\n302\n00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:55,992\nAll right.\n\n303\n00:15:55,992 --> 00:16:00,138\nOne other thing that I want to point out\nthat gets overlooked here are roles.\n\n304\n00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:03,709\nWith groups we have roles that\ndictate what people can do, and\n\n305\n00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,180\ndown here at the bottom left\nyou'll see those roles.\n\n306\n00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,110\nThere's three roles created automatically,\nowner, manager, and member.\n\n307\n00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,450\nOwner and manager are very similar.\n\n308\n00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,380\nThese are supposed to be\nthe people that run the list.\n\n309\n00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,580\nThe owner can do everything,\n\n310\n00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,850\ncan do anything they want to the list,\nincluding deleting the list.\n\n311\n00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,650\nAll right.\n\n312\n00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,770\nA manager can't actually delete the list,\nbut they can control membership.\n\n313\n00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,890\nThey can invite people to it or\nthey can kick people out.\n\n314\n00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,920\nThey're not like an IT administrator.\n\n315\n00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,390\nThey're just somebody\nwho's running the group.\n\n316\n00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,510\nAnd then you have members.\n\n317\n00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,450\nThese are people who are a part of\nthe group, who participate in it, but\n\n318\n00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,570\ndon't actually have control\nof the group itself.\n\n319\n00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,329\nThose three roles usually meet\nthe needs of most companies,\n\n320\n00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:49,000\nso that's probably all you need and\nyou don't have to mess with it.\n\n321\n00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,660\nBut notice that you've got a nice\nbig Create button up here.\n\n322\n00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,210\nYou can create custom roles that meet\nwhatever need it is that you have.\n\n323\n00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,455\nSo I can go and create a new role and\ngive it a name and a description and\n\n324\n00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:04,810\nyou'll see down here where you can\nspecify all sorts of neat stuff about it.\n\n325\n00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:10,610\nSo maybe I've got a Q and A forum,\nand so I've got my regular members,\n\n326\n00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,560\nbut then maybe I've got my verified\nmembers, or members that contribute a lot.\n\n327\n00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,440\nSo I might call them my VIPs,\nand I might want my VIPs to\n\n328\n00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,990\nhave a little more access or\njust something special that denotes them.\n\n329\n00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,440\nSo I'm gonna create a roll\nhere called VIP, and\n\n330\n00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,447\nI'll says these are my very\nimportant people who have\n\n331\n00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:38,390\ncontributed significantly to this forum,\nall right?\n\n332\n00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,200\nAnd then I can set a domain\nrestriction if I want to restrict\n\n333\n00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,220\nwho can have this role\nbased on their domain.\n\n334\n00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,079\nI'm gonna leave this one open.\n\n335\n00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,791\nI can make anybody a VIP if I want.\n\n336\n00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:50,732\nAnd I'm gonna add a badge and you can\nadd a badge which'll be a picture like\n\n337\n00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:56,540\na star or something that'll show up next\nto their name that shows them as a VIP.\n\n338\n00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,100\nSo I might get one of our graphics\nguys to whip up a little VIP\n\n339\n00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,830\nlogo that I can stick in there.\n\n340\n00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,350\nOr at a minimum, we can display a rank.\n\n341\n00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,920\nAnd so, I'll set their rank as VIP, so\nthat'll show up beneath their name.\n\n342\n00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,880\nSo, any time they post,\nwe'll know that hey, this person's a VIP.\n\n343\n00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:17,230\nAnd then I can specify any members,\nwhoever it is that we want and,\n\n344\n00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,180\noh, I have to pick somebody\nwho's already a member.\n\n345\n00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,420\nActually, I'm not going to show up,\nand what group did I pick?\n\n346\n00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,970\nAccounting.\n\n347\n00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,470\nWho did I make an accountant?\n\n348\n00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,410\nWell, anyhow, somebody.\n\n349\n00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,770\nI'd have to go in and find a user.\n\n350\n00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,450\nI can't remember who I put in here.\n\n351\n00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,620\nBut I would specify the users\nthat I wanted to have this rank.\n\n352\n00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,290\nI'd add them in, and now I've got it.\n\n353\n00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,410\nNow if that's all I wanted to do was\nhave a fancy rank, I could stop there.\n\n354\n00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,350\nBut it's normally this little tiny\nlink down here at the bottom that\n\n355\n00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,510\nI really want.\n\n356\n00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,020\nPermissions, all right.\n\n357\n00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,550\nWhen you hit Edit on that, your custom\nrole can do many, many different things.\n\n358\n00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,110\nYou'll see contact owners of the group,\nview member email addresses, view members.\n\n359\n00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,940\nWe saw those in the other screens.\n\n360\n00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,950\nBut then posting,\nare they allowed to post?\n\n361\n00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,840\nMaybe if you're a VIP,\nyou're allowed to attach files, but\n\n362\n00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,930\nif you're not a VIP,\nyou're not allowed to attach files.\n\n363\n00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,910\nI can go in and start to specify this.\n\n364\n00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,400\nI can say VIPs get to have custom\nprofile photos but other users don't.\n\n365\n00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480\nSo you just go through and\n\n366\n00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,260\nyou pick each of the options that you want\nthat role to have and it is very granular.\n\n367\n00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,330\nYou'll see all sorts of different things.\n\n368\n00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,520\nModeration values if you wanna\nrestrict who's allowed to post and\n\n369\n00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,920\nwho isn't,\nwhether they can move topics and so on.\n\n370\n00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,220\nWe go through and we specify\nexactly what we want them to have.\n\n371\n00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,174\nWhen we say done, we can hit save and\nnow I've got a custom role.\n\n372\n00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:40,508\nI've got the three roles that Google built\nin and now I've got my additional role,\n\n373\n00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:48,730\nwhich apparently is taking\nit's time on saving.\n\n374\n00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,430\nSo whenever it saves I'll\nhave a group called VIP.\n\n375\n00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,080\nSo I can still use my other roles but\nnow I've got this one.\n\n376\n00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,150\nThese are really neat because we\ncan further refine the permissions.\n\n377\n00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,810\nIf you were looking at those permission\nscreens a minute ago and going man, Don,\n\n378\n00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,780\nthose are kinda limited.\n\n379\n00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,120\nIt's real general,\nit applies to everybody.\n\n380\n00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,350\nRoles are how we make the permissions\napply to just some people.\n\n381\n00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,100\nSome people get more access than others,\n\n382\n00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,930\nother people get less access than others,\nand we dictate that through roles.\n\n383\n00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,280\nAll right.\n\n384\n00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,085\nA few other things that we might do if\nwe want to disable the group, all right.\n\n385\n00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:25,480\nMaybe we're having some problems with\nthe group, and we need to just work on it.\n\n386\n00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,399\nMaybe something happened\nwith our spam settings and\n\n387\n00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:30,700\nit's just overwhelmed with spam, so\nI wanna get that cleaned up, all right.\n\n388\n00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,070\nI might want to disable\nthe group temporarily so\n\n389\n00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,050\nthat people can't relay stuff through it.\n\n390\n00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,490\nGet it cleaned up, and\nthen make it available again.\n\n391\n00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,730\nSo we can make them enabled or\ndisabled at will.\n\n392\n00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,940\nAnd you'll see that over\nhere on the left side.\n\n393\n00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:50,230\nIf I go down to Information, and under\nInformation I'm gonna go down to Advanced.\n\n394\n00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,900\nAnd it still isn't saved.\n\n395\n00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,470\nI'll just OK and navigate away.\n\n396\n00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,450\nAll right, so I'm gonna go down\nto Information and Advanced.\n\n397\n00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,920\nAnd under Advanced you'll see the options\nto Disable and to Delete the group.\n\n398\n00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,300\nDisabling is temporary.\n\n399\n00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,630\nWhen you disable a group,\nit turns it off, but it's still there.\n\n400\n00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,100\nWe can turn it on whenever we want.\n\n401\n00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,390\nIf we're done with a group and we\nabsolutely don't want it around anymore,\n\n402\n00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,170\nyou can hit Delete, and\nthat's gonna get it out.\n\n403\n00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,310\nBig warning right here, though.\n\n404\n00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,445\nThere's no undo for this.\n\n405\n00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,680\nSo when remove it,\nit's gone and it's permanent.\n\n406\n00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,810\nSo they actually make you\ntype Delete this group.\n\n407\n00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,295\nRight here, you've gotta type that in and\nthen hit Delete before it'll actually go.\n\n408\n00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:32,550\nActually, this is a little bit different.\n\n409\n00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,020\nThey want you to type your explanation.\n\n410\n00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,350\nBut we need to type our explanation and\nthen hit delete this group, and\n\n411\n00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,170\nit'll wipe it out and that group will be\ngone, and it's gone for good, that's it,\n\n412\n00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,240\nno bringing it back.\n\n413\n00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,840\nSo you could have years of data in there,\nwiped out just like that, so\n\n414\n00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,940\nbe careful with the Delete\nthis group option.\n\n415\n00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,290\nIf you think you're gonna need it back,\nyou just hit Disable this group, that'll\n\n416\n00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,240\ndisable it and then later on you can come\nand re-enable the group to bring it back.\n\n417\n00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,490\nThat's usually the better option\nbecause you never know when you might\n\n418\n00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,000\nneed that data.\n\n419\n00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,130\nAnother option in here is down at\nthe bottom, the Reset this group.\n\n420\n00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,208\nIf you've messed around with\npermissions in the configuration and\n\n421\n00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,502\nyou've done something that's just\nmade this group really behave odd,\n\n422\n00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:13,128\nyou can come down here and reset it.\n\n423\n00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:17,415\nWhen you reset it, that'll let you put\nit back to the original settings for\n\n424\n00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:20,898\nan email list, web forum,\nQ&A, or collaborative inbox.\n\n425\n00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:24,880\nAnd it'll go ahead and rearrange all that,\nput the permissions back.\n\n426\n00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,540\nIt leaves the data in\nthere which is kinda nice.\n\n427\n00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,610\nBut it says here, additional roles may be\nremoved though they will not be deleted.\n\n428\n00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,800\nSo your information will stay,\nbut every permission setting and\n\n429\n00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,440\nconfiguration setting\ngets put back to normal.\n\n430\n00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,040\nIt gives you a chance to quickly reset and\nget going again.\n\n431\n00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,380\nI'll go ahead and re-enable this group,\nand that'll bring it back online, and\n\n432\n00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,919\nnow people will be able to get into it and\nwork with it.\n\n433\n00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,910\nAll right.\nSo those are some of the more advanced\n\n434\n00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,430\nfeatures that we've got\navailable with groups.\n\n435\n00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,230\nThere's a ton more, if you're ever\nbored and looking for something to do.\n\n436\n00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,790\nYou can browse through here and\nsee a lot of different things.\n\n437\n00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,620\nUnder Members, you've got all\nmembers where you can view the list.\n\n438\n00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220\nYou can invite people in.\n\n439\n00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,920\nYou've got Direct add members where you\ncan start to punch in the email addresses\n\n440\n00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,060\nto bring them in.\n\n441\n00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,990\nYou've got all sorts of\ndifferent things there.\n\n442\n00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,030\nYou can evaluate any join\nrequests that might be pending,\n\n443\n00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,320\npeople that have wanted to join.\n\n444\n00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,270\nAnd we've got it set to\nrequire us to interact.\n\n445\n00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,350\nAnd under Settings is where\nyou'll start to see other things,\n\n446\n00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,540\nlike email options, where we can tailor\nhow the emails look that come out of it.\n\n447\n00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,081\nWe can do custom footers,\n\n448\n00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:35,090\nour identities, all sorts of different\nthings that we can manipulate in here.\n\n449\n00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,390\nModeration is one of the more important\nones and I wanna highlight that even\n\n450\n00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,770\nthough it's not in the exam objective,\njust cuz this one is useful.\n\n451\n00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,420\nYou may be creating a group that\nanyone is allowed to email to.\n\n452\n00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,070\nBut you don't want their emails to just\nshow up in the group right of because you\n\n453\n00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,076\ndon't know if they're spam or whatever.\n\n454\n00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,438\nSo you might require\nmessages to be moderated and\n\n455\n00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,990\nwhen you do it there is\nsome neat settings here.\n\n456\n00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,412\nIf you just leave it at the default here,\nModerate all messages to the group.\n\n457\n00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:03,230\nThen whenever anybody posts it'll go to\nthe moderation queue and one of the owners\n\n458\n00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,490\nor managers will have to go and approve\nthe message, before it's allowed in.\n\n459\n00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,800\nBut if this is a high volume group,\nthat's a lot of work.\n\n460\n00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,720\nIt's a lot of burden to be\nable moderate all that.\n\n461\n00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,580\nSo, we might wanna change this.\n\n462\n00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,620\nNotice that moderate all\nmessages is turned on.\n\n463\n00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,500\nI could turn that off, and now it's\nmoderate messages from non members.\n\n464\n00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,108\nSo if somebody is not a member\nof the group and emails in,\n\n465\n00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:26,340\nthey'll get moderated.\n\n466\n00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,820\nBut if they are a member,\nthen they won't get moderated.\n\n467\n00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,720\nIt'll go right in.\n\n468\n00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,740\nBut there's another neat\nlittle option right here.\n\n469\n00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,350\nThe new member restriction.\n\n470\n00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,120\nAnd what you can do is you\ncan say new member posts.\n\n471\n00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,410\nIf you just joined,\nyour post is gonna be moderated.\n\n472\n00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,440\nBut if you've already posted and been\napproved, then you're not new anymore.\n\n473\n00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,410\nNow your future posts will just\nautomatically be approved and go in.\n\n474\n00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,820\nThat's a neat setting cuz\nit does reduce the burden.\n\n475\n00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,420\nYou're just moderating\nsomebody's first post,\n\n476\n00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,040\nnot every single post that they do for\nthe lifetime of their account.\n\n477\n00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,530\nSo pretty handy thing to have right there.\n\n478\n00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,660\nIf you reject somebody, you can\nspecify what message they received and\n\n479\n00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,730\nyou can adjust spam settings.\n\n480\n00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,960\nNow the spam settings\nare kind of important.\n\n481\n00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,060\nIf this is like a help desk or\na support type email address, you wanna be\n\n482\n00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,480\ncareful because what happens if you get\na false positive on a spam message?\n\n483\n00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,100\nWell, when it comes to you personally,\nit goes into your spam folder and\n\n484\n00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,210\nyou can get to it.\n\n485\n00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,190\nBut if the email goes to the group and\nit's spam, it just gets blocked and\n\n486\n00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,150\nit goes away.\n\n487\n00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,160\nSo you might need to tweak\nthe spam message settings.\n\n488\n00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,130\nSee, the default is send them\nto the moderation queue and\n\n489\n00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,620\nsend a notification to moderators,\nthat's good.\n\n490\n00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,120\nThe spam messages, instead of just getting\nblocked, will go to the moderators.\n\n491\n00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,710\nAll right.\n\n492\n00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,070\nBut you can change that and\n\n493\n00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,410\nsay things like skip the moderation\nqueue and post to the group.\n\n494\n00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,390\nIf you're using this as\njust a mailing list,\n\n495\n00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,130\nwhere people don't actually log\nin to the moderation queue.\n\n496\n00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,170\nThen you should choose this option,\n\n497\n00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,030\nwhich will not apply spam filtering\nto messages sent to the group.\n\n498\n00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,770\nThen, it gets forwarded along to\nthe individual users mailboxes.\n\n499\n00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,430\nAnd it gets spam filtered there.\n\n500\n00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,980\nThat way they can just see\nit in their spam folder.\n\n501\n00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,430\nThat may be a desirable configuration for\nyou.\n\n502\n00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,605\nOr maybe you prefer the moderation angle.\n\n503\n00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:11,790\nRight?\nAnd you can leave it that way,\n\n504\n00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,020\nsend them to the moderation queue.\n\n505\n00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,630\nAnd then they'll be waiting for\nyou right there.\n\n506\n00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,230\nSo that's all under settings and\nmoderation.\n\n507\n00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,820\nAll right.\n\n508\n00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,200\nSo quite a few different options there.\n\n509\n00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,680\nRight?\nIn this segment we took a look at\n\n510\n00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,350\ncreating a group,\nmanaging the members of a group, and\n\n511\n00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,840\nwe even talked a little bit about\ndeleting or disabling the group.\n\n512\n00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,990\nSo quite a few things there.\n\n513\n00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,670\nAnd then we looked at some of the advanced\noptions as far as moderation cues and\n\n514\n00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,180\nsome of the other permissions and\n\n515\n00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,780\nthe custom roles that we can\ncreate inside of our group.\n\n516\n00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,470\nActually, I'm kinda curious to\nsee whether or not mine saved.\n\n517\n00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,400\nIt didn't save really.\n\n518\n00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,300\nI'm not sure what happened there.\n\n519\n00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,820\nThis does happen from time to time.\n\n520\n00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,210\nI'm kind of glad that it did.\n\n521\n00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,780\nIf this happens to you on the exam,\nthe best thing to do is sign out and\n\n522\n00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,910\nsign back in.\n\n523\n00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,490\nOccasionally, your authentication tokens,\nyour cookies that are authenticating\n\n524\n00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,340\nwith Google, they can get where they time\nout or they just get a little quirky.\n\n525\n00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,980\nThe more changes you make, and\nyou can see behavior like this.\n\n526\n00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,600\nOn the exam, remember that they're grading\nthe end result, not how you did something.\n\n527\n00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,950\nSo, if it doesn't save that group,\nthey don't care that you did it.\n\n528\n00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,980\nIt just didn't save,\ncuz they're looking for what saved.\n\n529\n00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,120\nSo if that happens,\njust log out and log back in.\n\n530\n00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,180\nThat'll refresh authentication tokens,\nand then you can go in there and\n\n531\n00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,410\nrepeat the process.\n\n532\n00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,580\nYou need to make sure it shows up on that\nlist, otherwise it won't get graded.\n\n533\n00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,480\nAll right.\nWell, I think that's about it for\n\n534\n00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,430\ngroup settings.\n\n535\n00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,880\nStay tuned cuz we've got another segment\ncoming up that's gonna focus specifically\n\n536\n00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,780\non the permissions.\n\n537\n00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,923\nSo that's a good one to catch.\n\n538\n00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,187\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n539\n00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:42,046\nI'll see you then.\n\n540\n00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:50,980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,410\nObjective 8.3 is demonstrating how\nto share documents, sites, and\n\n2\n00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,340\nvideos with user groups.\n\n3\n00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,010\nNow, groups are really handy for\n\n4\n00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,650\nproviding the access to resources\nwithout having to do it individually.\n\n5\n00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,300\nOne of the examples I like to use is\nif I have an accounting department, and\n\n6\n00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,340\nI want all of the accounting department\nto have access to a particular file.\n\n7\n00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,290\nI could go and add each member\nof the accounting department and\n\n8\n00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,550\nshare that resource with them\nindividually with them but every time I\n\n9\n00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,930\nhired somebody new in accounting I'd\nhave to go in and reshare that content.\n\n10\n00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,130\nBy using a group I can avoid that.\n\n11\n00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,020\nI can share all the various content\nI need with the accounting group, and\n\n12\n00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,850\nthen anyone who's in that\ngroup will have access.\n\n13\n00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,040\nIt makes life a lot easier.\n\n14\n00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,770\nAnd because all of the Google\nservices talk with each other,\n\n15\n00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,160\nit really makes life easy within\nthe Google Apps services environment.\n\n16\n00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,920\nLet me show you an example, and I'm gonna\nshow you this with a Google Doc, just\n\n17\n00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,450\na word processor document that I'm going\nto create here inside of my google drive.\n\n18\n00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,430\nSo I'm going to go to My Drive and I've\ngot a folder in here called Documents.\n\n19\n00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,620\nIf I go into Documents I'll see where\nI've created my employee handbook.\n\n20\n00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,370\nI want all of the employees in my company\nto have access to the employee handbook.\n\n21\n00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,841\nWell if I want them to have access to it,\nI could right click on employee handbook\n\n22\n00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:30,740\nand choose share, and then I could come in\nand I could type somebody's email address.\n\n23\n00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,690\nSo I want to share this with Chris Poland,\nso I'm gonna share it with him.\n\n24\n00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,348\nI want him to be able to view it,\nI don't want him to be able to edit it,\n\n25\n00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,930\nbut I can share it, and\nnow I'll send that along, and\n\n26\n00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,269\nChris is gonna have access to my employee\nhandbook, so it now shows as shared.\n\n27\n00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,130\nBut then as I hire more employees,\nI've gotta remember to come here and\n\n28\n00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,690\nshare this handbook out again,\nso they have that access.\n\n29\n00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,880\nThat becomes frustrating really quickly,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,860\nAs your company grows,\nyou're having to constantly go in and\n\n31\n00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,430\nreset these permissions.\n\n32\n00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,020\nSo instead, I can use a group.\n\n33\n00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,890\nSo I've created a group\ncalled All Employees.\n\n34\n00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,510\nAnd it includes everyone in ITProTV.\n\n35\n00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,070\nSo if I want everyone in ITProTV\nto have access to this handbook,\n\n36\n00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,810\ninstead of sharing with a person,\nI can share with the group.\n\n37\n00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,730\nAll I have to do is go to share,\nand just like with the user,\n\n38\n00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,690\ninstead of a user I'm gonna type\nin the group's email address.\n\n39\n00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,470\nI'm gonna type in everyone@itprotv.net.\n\n40\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,450\nThat's the group I made that\nincludes the entire company.\n\n41\n00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,920\nOr I could do accounting, if I had one.\n\n42\n00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,830\nI don't think I do, but I'll do it anyway.\n\n43\n00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,320\nI can do accounting and\npunch that one in and\n\n44\n00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,360\nnow it is going to send\nan e-mail to that one.\n\n45\n00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,070\nWhen you add a group,\nanyone that is in the group right now and\n\n46\n00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,550\nanyone that is added to\nthat group in the future\n\n47\n00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,420\nwill have access to the resource\nthat you're sharing.\n\n48\n00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,590\nAnd so when I hit Send,\nit's gonna send that out, and\n\n49\n00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,480\nit's now shared with all of those people.\n\n50\n00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,300\nSo, when I go back into my sharing screen,\n\n51\n00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,250\nI can see here that it's shared\nwith Chris Poland and two groups.\n\n52\n00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,460\nAnd if I click on that,\nI can see exactly who it's shared with.\n\n53\n00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,090\nAnd notice, I made a mistake.\n\n54\n00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,370\nWhen I shared with Chris, I said can view.\n\n55\n00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,720\nI didn't want him to edit it.\n\n56\n00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,620\nBut, on all employees I set to can edit.\n\n57\n00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,490\nSo now, if Chris logs in, he'll be able to\nedit this because all employees have it.\n\n58\n00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,500\nSo, I need to change that.\n\n59\n00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,650\nAnd you can change it after the fact.\n\n60\n00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,520\nI'm going to switch it to view.\n\n61\n00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,030\nSo, I'm going to make it\nwhere all employees can view,\n\n62\n00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,520\nthe accounting department can view,\nand Chris Poland can view.\n\n63\n00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,700\nI'm the owner so I can do whatever I want.\n\n64\n00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,121\nI might have a manager's group that\nI want to allow to edit, and so\n\n65\n00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,560\nI can put that in there and\nadd them to the list.\n\n66\n00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,880\nIn fact I believe I do\nhave an executive's group.\n\n67\n00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,620\nSo I can go back into my sharing screen,\nand I'll hit share and\n\n68\n00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,040\nI'm going to punch in my\nexecutives@itprotv.net.\n\n69\n00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,150\nAnd I want my executives to be\nable to edit this document.\n\n70\n00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,920\nAnd so I'll share that, and\n\n71\n00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,700\nnow anyone who's in the executive\ngroup will be able to edit.\n\n72\n00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,240\nIf I take them out of the executives\ngroup, they'll no longer be able to edit.\n\n73\n00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,390\nAll right, now let's see if it worked.\n\n74\n00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,019\nI'm going to log out as myself.\n\n75\n00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,120\nAnd I'll log in as one of my other users.\n\n76\n00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,840\nI'll log in as Dave, and when I log in,\nI didn't share with Dave specifically.\n\n77\n00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,860\nI did share with Chris specifically,\nbut not Dave, and\n\n78\n00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,720\nhe's a member of All Users, he's a member\nof that everyone group that I made.\n\n79\n00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,270\nSo he should have access,\neven though I didn't share with him.\n\n80\n00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,060\nNow, if he goes into his drive,\nhis drive is empty.\n\n81\n00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,850\nBut if he goes to shared with me,\nthere's the Employee Handbook,\n\n82\n00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,240\nshared from Don Pezet.\n\n83\n00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,560\nAnd if he clicks on that to edit it,\nhe can see the Employee Handbook,\n\n84\n00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,860\nhe can make changes, but oh, shoot.\n\n85\n00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,060\nDid I make him an administrator?\n\n86\n00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,270\nDad gum it.\n\n87\n00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,010\nI share with Dave, and Dave is an\nadministrator, so he is actually able to\n\n88\n00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,720\nedit this document, so\nhe's able to make changes because of that.\n\n89\n00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,460\nRemember, when you're a member\nof more than one group,\n\n90\n00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,450\nyou're able to make changes like this even\nif you don't have it explicitly defined,\n\n91\n00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,090\nespecially when you're\na super administrator.\n\n92\n00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,020\nI forgot I had made him an administrator.\n\n93\n00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,900\nBut a normal user would be able to\nsee the document, and not edit it.\n\n94\n00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,410\nBecause I set those permissions as view.\n\n95\n00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640\nAll right, but he's got that access.\n\n96\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,230\nSo, sharing with a group is no\ndifferent than sharing with a person.\n\n97\n00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,630\nWe just type in the email address for\nthe group, and\n\n98\n00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,380\neverybody in that group is\ngoing to get that access.\n\n99\n00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,900\nThis is with a document.\n\n100\n00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,350\nIt's the exact same for other things.\n\n101\n00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,880\nThe objective specifically\ncalls out videos and sites.\n\n102\n00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,070\nSo if I have sites defined and\nyou know what I need to log out as Dave.\n\n103\n00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,910\nIt's not a good idea to be logged\nin as two people at the same time.\n\n104\n00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,270\nI'm gonna switch back to me.\n\n105\n00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,680\nAnd go to my admin console, you may or\n\n106\n00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,240\nmay not actually use Sites in\nGoogle Apps but if we go in here and\n\n107\n00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,485\nwe take a look at are services you'll see\nwhere you have Google Sites right here.\n\n108\n00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,085\nSo you can create websites\ninside of Google Apps.\n\n109\n00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,885\nAnd you can share an entire\nsite with a group.\n\n110\n00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,735\nSo you have to create one first.\n\n111\n00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:58,315\nI guess that's kind of our big thing.\n\n112\n00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,575\nAnd you'll have the URL there to go and\nmanage your sites and\n\n113\n00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,945\nto be able to create them.\n\n114\n00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,825\nAnd you can share them with the group.\n\n115\n00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:07,620\nIf you go into YouTube and you put\nvideos in YouTube you can share them\n\n116\n00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,240\nwith a group and you can set\nthe permissions, and so on right then.\n\n117\n00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,740\nSo it's really the same\nthroughout all of Google Apps.\n\n118\n00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,060\nSo even though the objective just\ncalls out documents and videos and\n\n119\n00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,440\nsites, it really goes beyond\nthat to calendars and\n\n120\n00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,060\nthe other different items that\nwe create inside of Google Apps.\n\n121\n00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,240\nSo maybe I'm creating a helpdesk website.\n\n122\n00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,820\nAnd so it's going to be this address right\nhere, I can pick my various options,\n\n123\n00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,300\nyou know, I'll just do a blank\ntemplate and I'll create the site.\n\n124\n00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,180\nAnd now that it's created, I can share\nthat with whatever group I want to be\n\n125\n00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,200\nweb masters or editors for this thing.\n\n126\n00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,550\nSo I can go in and start to set that.\n\n127\n00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,890\nYou got your share button right up here\nat the top, so I can hit share, and\n\n128\n00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,970\nI can specify who I wanna share this with.\n\n129\n00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,040\nI can see it's got me in there.\n\n130\n00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,583\nBut I'm gonna invite\nexecutives@itprotv.net.\n\n131\n00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,460\nAnd I'm gonna give them\nthe can edit option.\n\n132\n00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,100\nI want them to see this site,\nand be able to edit it.\n\n133\n00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,770\nSo I'll send that along.\n\n134\n00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,470\nAnd then I'll add All Employees and\nlet them view it, right?\n\n135\n00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,250\nSo that was the, everyone, and\nI just want them to be able to view,\n\n136\n00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,610\nand we'll send that along.\n\n137\n00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,330\nSo, now,\nthey'll all be able to see this site, and\n\n138\n00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,670\nexecutives will be able to edit that,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,600\nSo, not really any different\nthan sharing with the user.\n\n140\n00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,950\nThe convenience is when we\nhire a new employee and\n\n141\n00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,480\nI put them in the executive's group,\nif the executive group is able\n\n142\n00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,150\nto edit 20 different sites, that employee\nis now able to edit 20 different sites.\n\n143\n00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,970\nBecause they're in the group\nthat has those permissions.\n\n144\n00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,780\nSo groups are all about\nsaving administrative effort.\n\n145\n00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,360\nAll right, so in this segment,\nwe got a chance to see\n\n146\n00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,680\nusing groups to make life a little easier\non us, as far as setting permissions.\n\n147\n00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,440\nWe saw how to share out access\nto a document, in a site.\n\n148\n00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,350\nI didn't do a YouTube video,\nbut it's the same way.\n\n149\n00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,620\nYou just use that Share button, and you'll\nget a chance to see that, all right.\n\n150\n00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,150\nCalendars, again, same thing.\n\n151\n00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,240\nDefinitely make use of the groups,\nthey will make your life easier.\n\n152\n00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,430\nAll right, hope you enjoyed the segment.\n\n153\n00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,921\nStay tuned, more Google Apps after this.\n\n154\n00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:12,589\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,900\nObjective 8.4 is demonstrate\nhow to use groups for\n\n2\n00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,690\nbusiness to manage permissions and\ngroup settings.\n\n3\n00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,870\nWhen we create admin console groups,\n\n4\n00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,190\nthe permissions are all right\nthere inside the admin console.\n\n5\n00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,500\nPretty straight forward.\n\n6\n00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,730\nBut when we do Google groups for\nbusiness, we get a lot more power and\n\n7\n00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,800\na lot more functionality and we get the\ndedicated administrative interface found\n\n8\n00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,800\nat groups.google.com/a/ and\nwhatever your domain name happens to be.\n\n9\n00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,570\nSo, we may need to go in there to\nadjust permissions on the groups.\n\n10\n00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,240\nNow, we can create those permissions\nAt the time the group is created,\n\n11\n00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,630\nthat's wonderful for new stuff but\neven on that screen it's fairly limited.\n\n12\n00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,820\nSo, oftentimes, we're going to have to go\nto the main groups administration screen\n\n13\n00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,980\nto customize that.\n\n14\n00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,240\nLet me show you what I mean, alright.\n\n15\n00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,220\nFirst off, I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate a new group.\n\n16\n00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,570\nIf I go to my admin console...\n\n17\n00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,080\nAnd I go into groups, which for\nyou might be under more controls,\n\n18\n00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,180\nif you haven't pinned it already.\n\n19\n00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,940\nAnd I'll go under Google Groups and\nI can start to add in groups right here.\n\n20\n00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,590\nAnd when you create a new group,\nit's gonna ask you about the access level.\n\n21\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,490\nThis is your first brush with permissions,\nand it's really limited.\n\n22\n00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,450\nYou only get four choices, and\n\n23\n00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,820\nno real ability to customize it beyond\nwhat it's already showing, all right?\n\n24\n00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,170\nSo if one of these four meets our needs,\ngreat.\n\n25\n00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,270\nThis is all we need to know\nabout permissions, all right?\n\n26\n00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,390\nLet's run down what these are.\n\n27\n00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,980\nThe first one is Public.\n\n28\n00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,140\nIf you choose Public,\nEveryone in your company, and\n\n29\n00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,780\neveryone on the Internet can see this\ngroup and read all the posts to it.\n\n30\n00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,520\nAnd they can also post and communicate,\nso they can not only just read, but\n\n31\n00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,480\nthey can interact with this group.\n\n32\n00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,360\nIf you're trying to create some\nkind of public forum or access for\n\n33\n00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,880\nyour customers,\nthis is usually a great option.\n\n34\n00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,510\nThe next option is Team.\n\n35\n00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,540\nIf this is supposed to be an internal\ngroup for your company but not for\n\n36\n00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,380\nthe outside world,\nTeam is a great solution.\n\n37\n00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,870\nWith this one only managers\ncan invite new members.\n\n38\n00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,410\nYou'll have a manager who will\ncontrol who's in the group.\n\n39\n00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,800\nBut once somebody's in the group they'll\nhave access to post and communicate.\n\n40\n00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,030\nThe third one is Announcement Only.\n\n41\n00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,280\nWith announcement only,\nyou can have members that join and\n\n42\n00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,110\nread to the group but,\nthey're not allowed to post.\n\n43\n00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,670\nThe only person or\npeople allowed to post are the Managers.\n\n44\n00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,840\nSo, if you're a manager of this group,\nyou can post and send messages out to\n\n45\n00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,820\neverybody who's a member, but\nthe members cannot communicate back.\n\n46\n00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,750\nIt's a one way communication,\nthat's why they call it announcement.\n\n47\n00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,590\nThe fourth one is Restricted and\n\n48\n00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,960\nRestricted is where we want to create\na hidden group a group that's not in our\n\n49\n00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,710\ngroup directory that you have a manager\nwho controls membership entirely.\n\n50\n00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,340\nRegular members can't invite new people to\njoin the group only the administrator can.\n\n51\n00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,100\nThis is a great way for\ncreating a hidden private group used for\n\n52\n00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,969\nspecific projects or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n53\n00:02:58,122 --> 00:03:01,920\nAll right once you pick the access level\nthe only other option we really have this\n\n54\n00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,890\nadd all users within\nyour domain to the group.\n\n55\n00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,240\nIf you want this group to contain everyone\nin your company you can check that\n\n56\n00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,800\nbox and you're done.\n\n57\n00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,560\nBut if you don't check it,\nyou'll have to go and\n\n58\n00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,500\nmanually control membership afterwards.\n\n59\n00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,500\nAll right, so these are the permission\nsettings we see when we create the group.\n\n60\n00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,770\nWhat about after it's created?\n\n61\n00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,900\nWell, after it's created,\nwe need to go and modify the group.\n\n62\n00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,800\nSo I'm just gonna cancel\nout of this screen.\n\n63\n00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,530\nAnd when we modify the group,\nyou really don't want to modify it from\n\n64\n00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,600\nhere inside of the admin console\nbecause it's fairly limited.\n\n65\n00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,599\nSo when we go in, I can take one,\nlike my sales group.\n\n66\n00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,520\nAnd when you go into the Sales Group,\nyou'll see options here for\n\n67\n00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,390\nmanaging users,\naccess settings, and so on.\n\n68\n00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,110\nAnd on each of these screens,\nlike on the Access Settings screen,\n\n69\n00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,470\nyou'll see where it'll jump you over\nto the Google Groups for Business site.\n\n70\n00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,332\nAnd that's what I want.\n\n71\n00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:54,670\nI wanna be over here because I get\nthe more granular control of permissions.\n\n72\n00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,730\nNow the permissions are gonna be set based\non the template that I chose when I was\n\n73\n00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,330\nsetting it up.\n\n74\n00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,990\nWhen I created the group you had\nthat choice of four settings,\n\n75\n00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,400\nthose were actually templates for\n\n76\n00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,935\na whole series of permissions\nthat have now been put in place.\n\n77\n00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,225\nFrom here, we can modify that.\n\n78\n00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:14,265\nWe can customize it to meet whatever\nneed we have and it jumped for\n\n79\n00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:18,045\nme right here to the access\npermissions section.\n\n80\n00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:21,675\nBut if you came about through the actual\ngroup screen, you go into your group\n\n81\n00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:26,175\nsettings, and then you go under\nPermissions, and Access permissions.\n\n82\n00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,987\nAnd here's where we can tweak who's\nallowed to contact the owner,\n\n83\n00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:31,820\nwho is allowed to view the member list and\n\n84\n00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,250\nwho's allowed to view the member emails\nand lastly who's allowed to view topics.\n\n85\n00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,470\nJust who's allowed to read\nstuff that's even in here.\n\n86\n00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,778\nAnd when you drop these lists down,\nyou'll see your choices.\n\n87\n00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,960\nDo we wanna allow public or\njust members of the group or\n\n88\n00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,500\njust managers of the group.\n\n89\n00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,760\nAnd you can customize that,\n\n90\n00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,490\neach one of these giving you\nthe option to filter that access.\n\n91\n00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,230\nAll right, and you just put check\nmarks by the ones that you want or\n\n92\n00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,350\nyou remove check marks by\nthe ones that you don't want.\n\n93\n00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,260\nAll right, now these permissions\njust accessing the group.\n\n94\n00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,680\nBut there's a lot more\nthan just accessing.\n\n95\n00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,410\nFor example, posting,\nwho's allowed to post?\n\n96\n00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,860\nOh and I didn't save my changes but\nI'll just hit OK.\n\n97\n00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,930\nSo here's who's allowed to post and\n\n98\n00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,480\nwhen we look, you can find who's allowed\nto assign topics, or attach files,\n\n99\n00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,530\nhave custom profiles, but\npost is the one I'm looking for.\n\n100\n00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,390\nAnd I can see on this\ngroup it's set to public.\n\n101\n00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,030\nAnyone in the world can send\nan e-mail to sales@itprotv.net,\n\n102\n00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,640\nmy sales group,\nbecause I've got post set to public.\n\n103\n00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,200\nIf I want this to be internal\nonly I can change that, and\n\n104\n00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,760\nI can remove public and leave it\nlike this, all organization members.\n\n105\n00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,330\nNow anybody in my Google apps organization\ncan email into this list, but\n\n106\n00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,250\nno one else can.\n\n107\n00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,240\nNobody outside or we can go through and\nstart to tweet this even more in the same\n\n108\n00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,040\nmembers of the group and if the manager\nis controlling membership we now dictate\n\n109\n00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,660\nwho is allowed to get these messages user\nby user as we put them in this group.\n\n110\n00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,120\nSo, real powerful stuff there.\n\n111\n00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,140\nYou'll see other options in here like\nbeing able to post as the group,\n\n112\n00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,780\nreplying to an author, reply to a post\nthat was made, we have attaching files,\n\n113\n00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,560\nassigning a topic to another user,\nthat's useful in a Q&A form.\n\n114\n00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,810\nSomebody posts a question you can\nassign it to somebody to answer.\n\n115\n00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,110\nYou'll see where you can figure\neach of these different options.\n\n116\n00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,310\nThe default options may be different here\nbased on the settings you chose when you\n\n117\n00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,020\ncreated that group, so don't assume\nit's always gonna be set the same way.\n\n118\n00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,769\nVerify your settings and make sure\nthey're set the way that you need them.\n\n119\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,050\nModeration is another thing that\nwe might choose to configure.\n\n120\n00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,470\nWith moderation this is where we say,\n\n121\n00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,840\nif somebody posts don't send\nit to everybody right away.\n\n122\n00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,480\nStick it in a moderation queue and let\na manager approve or reject the message.\n\n123\n00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,350\nAll right, you may or\nmay not want moderation.\n\n124\n00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,110\nWhen you look in here,\n\n125\n00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,050\nyou'll see where you can choose\nwho's allowed to approve the posts.\n\n126\n00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,420\nBut down here you'll be able\nto manipulate whether or\n\n127\n00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,770\nnot we're actually doing the moderation.\n\n128\n00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,350\nSo there's a ton of different\noptions in here based on that.\n\n129\n00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,300\nMost importantly, you're gonna be\ndealing with Approve Messages.\n\n130\n00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,710\nThis is who's allowed to moderate.\n\n131\n00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,170\nAnd the default is just managers,\nall right?\n\n132\n00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,910\nBut you might want to tweak that and say\nany existing member can moderate a post,\n\n133\n00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,230\nor owners, actually managers and\nowners are chosen here for you by default.\n\n134\n00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,990\nSo you can tweak that adjust\nto the needs of your group,\n\n135\n00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,505\ndetermining who's gonna be a moderated.\n\n136\n00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:31,130\nAll right, now notice I didn't have\nan option in here that says just not to\n\n137\n00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,580\nmoderate at all, right?\n\n138\n00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,160\nI covered those in another segment, but\n\n139\n00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,190\njust as a refresher, if you go up under\nsettings, you'll see moderation there.\n\n140\n00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,340\nAnd that's where we can dictate whether or\nnot we moderate at all, right.\n\n141\n00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,050\nWhether we moderate the group, or\nwhether we don't, and then what we do for\n\n142\n00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,950\nrejected people and\nwhether we use spam filters.\n\n143\n00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,650\nSo that's actually buried under settings.\n\n144\n00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,670\nNot so much permissions, right?\n\n145\n00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,880\nBut under Permissions and Moderation,\nhere's where we're determining\n\n146\n00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,010\nwho is a moderator, who is allowed\nto allow or reject a message.\n\n147\n00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,020\nAll right, so we saw our basic\npermissions and our posting permissions,\n\n148\n00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,360\nour moderation, there's a few other\nthings that we might wanna tweak\n\n149\n00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,470\nLike the ability to join the group.\n\n150\n00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:19,450\nIf I go back up to basic here, we'll see\nwho's allowed to approve and add members.\n\n151\n00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,910\nIf I wanna allow invitations\nto be sent to join the group.\n\n152\n00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,530\nBy default, the owner or\nmanager can do that.\n\n153\n00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,500\nBut you can actually change this\nto say all members of the group.\n\n154\n00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,440\nNow any member who's currently\nin the group can invite\n\n155\n00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,260\nother people to participate in it.\n\n156\n00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,950\nThe other option is this, join the group.\n\n157\n00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,400\nYou can open that up and\n\n158\n00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,890\nyou can say anyone in the organization or\nanyone in the organization can ask.\n\n159\n00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,665\nWhat this is gonna do is dictate\nwhether people can do self service.\n\n160\n00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:50,740\nThe way I've got it set right now is\nanyone in the organization can ask.\n\n161\n00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,000\nSo anybody in Google Apps,\nin my org, can see this group, and\n\n162\n00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,190\ncontact the owner to ask to join, to say\nhey, can I join this group, all right?\n\n163\n00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,670\nThat would require the owner to\nlook at them and approve them.\n\n164\n00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,200\nBut if you wanted it to be completely self\nservice, they can opt in to this group or\n\n165\n00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,300\nopt out, you would change that to\nsay anyone in the organization,\n\n166\n00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,230\njust like that.\n\n167\n00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,280\nIt doesn't have to ask, they just\nchoose to join and it lets them join.\n\n168\n00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,980\nThat's really nice if you have something\nlike a company softball team and so you\n\n169\n00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,590\ncreate a group, and you say anybody who\nwants to be on the softball team can join,\n\n170\n00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,210\njust sign-up for this group.\n\n171\n00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,350\nAnd they can go and join the group and\nyou don't moderate it,\n\n172\n00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,060\nyou don't have to approve or\ndecline them or whatever, their just in.\n\n173\n00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,540\nAnd if they ever decide\nthey're tired of softball and\n\n174\n00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,240\nthey want out,\nthey can always just unsubscribe.\n\n175\n00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,829\nThey can leave the group and\nnot be a member of it, all right.\n\n176\n00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:48,490\nSo we control that right here,\nthrough the permissions.\n\n177\n00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,683\nSo really neat stuff,\npretty easy to kind of populate in here,\n\n178\n00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,970\nthe permissions are very granular.\n\n179\n00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,940\nNow, if you looked at it and said,\nDon, you're saying that it's granular,\n\n180\n00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,170\nit's not granular enough,\nwhere is the higher permissions?\n\n181\n00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,650\nWell, what we see here are what's\ntypically used by more organizations.\n\n182\n00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,190\nSo, between these four areas you've really\ngot what most people are gonna need, but\n\n183\n00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,660\nif you wanna be super granular,\n\n184\n00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,520\nreally defining what access people have\nyou're going to need to work with roles.\n\n185\n00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,460\nI covered roles in another segment also.\n\n186\n00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,768\nBut just to recap, if you look under\n\"roles\" there's three roles by default,\n\n187\n00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:24,690\nowner, manager, and member.\n\n188\n00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,860\nAnd we've seen that time and\ntime again in our permissions.\n\n189\n00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,010\nWhen we set those permissions a lot\nof times we were picking owner and\n\n190\n00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,130\nmanager, right?\n\n191\n00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,010\nOr owner and manager and any member.\n\n192\n00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,620\nThat was these three roles.\n\n193\n00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,250\nYou can create custom roles, and\nwhen we create a custom role,\n\n194\n00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,540\nyou give it a name so\nI might call this my senior members.\n\n195\n00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,950\nPeople who have been a member for\na while, right?\n\n196\n00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,820\nAnd down here at the bottom,\nI can edit their permissions and\n\n197\n00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,260\nI can really get specific here.\n\n198\n00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,800\nAbout whether they can assign topics or\nattach files, whether they can reply.\n\n199\n00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,890\nAll those other little settings,\nwe can get very specific about what\n\n200\n00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,870\nthey're allowed to do based on\ntheir status as a senior member.\n\n201\n00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,100\nSo once that's created, I've got this new\nrole in place that I'm able to use for\n\n202\n00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,530\ndelegating out this access, all right.\n\n203\n00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,000\nSo I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n204\n00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,350\nOh, I've gotta give it a description and\nwe'll let that save.\n\n205\n00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,870\nThere we go.\n\n206\n00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,660\nSo, now, I've got this senior\nmembers' role that I've created,\n\n207\n00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,140\none extra thing that I can use\nwhen I'm doling out my permission.\n\n208\n00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,820\nNow, one little caveat, roles are not\nsupported for every single permission.\n\n209\n00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,850\nIt's supported on many of them but when\nyou go to assign permissions, you may or\n\n210\n00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,930\nmay not see your custom roll here in\nthe list as you go through and pick it.\n\n211\n00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,710\nDon't worry about that,\n\n212\n00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,950\nyou chose the permission that\nroll should have on the list.\n\n213\n00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,200\nSo see here on Assign Topic, I have\nSenior Members right there, I can pick it.\n\n214\n00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,910\nThat's that custom roll I made.\n\n215\n00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,260\nHere's Members, Managers, Owners.\n\n216\n00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,730\nThat's the other three rolls.\n\n217\n00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,550\nSo all four of them show up right there.\n\n218\n00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,320\nFor a setting where senior members doesn't\nshow up, like under basic permissions,\n\n219\n00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,500\nit's usually a permission that's just not\nrelevant to something like senior members,\n\n220\n00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,440\nlike the ability to view topics.\n\n221\n00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,810\nIf I'm letting every member view topics,\n\n222\n00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,510\nthen it doesn't really matter if you're\nsenior or not, you'll be able to view it.\n\n223\n00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,050\nSo, we can specify all that, get a good\nlevel of granularity in here and\n\n224\n00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,640\nreally tweak things and\nmake them as customized as we need.\n\n225\n00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,210\nSo permissions are very powerful, they're\nreally one of the main reasons you want to\n\n226\n00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:30,590\ngo to Google Groups for business as\nopposed to sticking with the regular\n\n227\n00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,570\nadmin console groups which give you very\nlittle control in the way of information.\n\n228\n00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,030\nAll right, so in this segment we\ntook a look at Google groups for\n\n229\n00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,775\nbusiness and the permissions\nthat we can set on them, right.\n\n230\n00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:45,020\nThe generic template-based permissions\nwe set when we create a group,\n\n231\n00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,710\nas well as the granular permissions\nwe set on the group itself.\n\n232\n00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,130\nAnd finally we talked a little bit about\nroles and how we can use those to get\n\n233\n00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,470\neven more specific based on\nthe architecture of our organization.\n\n234\n00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,730\nAll right,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n235\n00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,760\nThis is really the last objective,\n8.4 was the final one.\n\n236\n00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,730\nSo I don't have any more Google apps\ncoming up after this, like I normally say.\n\n237\n00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,891\nSo, let me wrap it up with this, and\nsay, thank you for watching, and\n\n238\n00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:10,975\ngood luck on your exam.\n\n239\n00:13:10,975
