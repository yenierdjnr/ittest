          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,071\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:13,095\nFor many organizations setting up\ncollaboration software, document editing,\n\n3\n00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:18,950\nspreadsheet software, and online storage\nis a really very difficult undertaking.\n\n4\n00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370\nAnd that's where organizations like Google\nhave stepped in to provide products like\n\n5\n00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,470\nGoogle Apps that make you not\nhave to reinvent the wheel.\n\n6\n00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,250\nGoogle Apps is a well-rounded\nsuite of software and\n\n7\n00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,550\nonline services that provides the needs\nfor most small and medium organizations.\n\n8\n00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,190\nI say, small and medium,\nreally large and enterprise too.\n\n9\n00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,190\nThere are enterprise customers with\nGoogle that have hundreds of thousands of\n\n10\n00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,510\nemployees all using solely Google Apps\naccounts, it's really impressive.\n\n11\n00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,090\nWith Google Apps,\nyou get a full office suite,\n\n12\n00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,390\nyou get the ability to do spreadsheets,\ndocuments,\n\n13\n00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,150\nslide presentations, all within an online\nhosted application environment,\n\n14\n00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,240\nwhich means no software needs\nto be installed on the client.\n\n15\n00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,393\nIn addition to that, you get shared\nstorage through Google Drive,\n\n16\n00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:09,449\nyou get group mailing lists, calendaring,\nall sorts of additional functionality.\n\n17\n00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:13,808\nAnd really the best part of it is that it\nis all hosted on Google state of the art\n\n18\n00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:18,713\ndata centers, so you don't have to back it\nup, you don't have to pay the power bill,\n\n19\n00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,890\nyou don't have to manage the resources for\nthat.\n\n20\n00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,370\nIt's all done for you at a per user\nlicense fee that you can adapt as\n\n21\n00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,910\nyour company shrinks and grows, so it is\na great solution for a lot of companies.\n\n22\n00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,460\nThe challenge though, is getting it\nset up, and getting your feet wet.\n\n23\n00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,540\nFor a lot of people this\nis a new way to think.\n\n24\n00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,570\nA lot of us are stuck in the old\nparadigm of you buy a desktop,\n\n25\n00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,160\nyou install your software right there,\nand you're done.\n\n26\n00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,680\nNow, we're transitioning it off, so\nthat the desktop doesn't matter anymore.\n\n27\n00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,590\nYou could be on your laptop, your cell\nphone, your desktop PC, your desktop Mac,\n\n28\n00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,690\na Linux machine, doesn't matter, and you\ncan access the same exact software, and\n\n29\n00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,280\nthe same exact resources\nwithout installing anything\n\n30\n00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,860\naside from a web browser\non your workstation.\n\n31\n00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,127\nSo, really handy, really neat technology,\n\n32\n00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,400\nand a lot of organizations\nare going that way.\n\n33\n00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,981\nITProTV, when we first started to form our\ncompany, Edutainment Live, we decided,\n\n34\n00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:14,723\nlet's go with Google Apps,\nbecause we don't need the infrastructure,\n\n35\n00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:20,730\nwe need to focus on creating shows, not\nfocus on managing our own document system.\n\n36\n00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,100\nSo, that's a great solution for\na lot of organizations, and\n\n37\n00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,470\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe covering in this show.\n\n38\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,650\nNow, when we set out to do this show,\nit was just gonna be a skills show.\n\n39\n00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,120\nA how to use Google Apps in your\norganization, but during the planning\n\n40\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,690\nprocess of our show, we were talking to\nsome of the guys that are at Google, and\n\n41\n00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,730\nthey informed us of a new\ncertification they were releasing.\n\n42\n00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,230\nWhich is the Google Apps\ncertified administrator, so\n\n43\n00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,560\nthey now have an administrator\ncertification that's available.\n\n44\n00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,605\nYou can go and show your knowledge\nof working with Google Apps,\n\n45\n00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,708\nit's supposed to be the equivalent\nof working, they say here,\n\n46\n00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,479\nsix months of experience managing 50,\nor more users.\n\n47\n00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,654\nIt's kind of a what the certification\nshows, and you can take their exam, and\n\n48\n00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:05,150\nwhen you pass, you're a Google Apps\ncertified administrator.\n\n49\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,960\nYou can show people that\nyou have that knowledge, so\n\n50\n00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,010\nit was really excellent timing.\n\n51\n00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,490\nWe got a chance to see the exam\nwhile it was in beta, and\n\n52\n00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,820\nnow we're gonna produce\nthe show built around it.\n\n53\n00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,510\nSo, our general skill show has\nactually become a certification show,\n\n54\n00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,800\nit's kinda neat that happened and\nall, it kinda just fell into place.\n\n55\n00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,560\nI'll post the link to this website with\nthe show notes, you get a chance to see\n\n56\n00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,560\nthose, but basically, what it is\nis a certification that just shows\n\n57\n00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,090\nyou have the know how to setup, and\noperate a Google Apps environment.\n\n58\n00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,420\nThe things that a company is going\nto need to know, things like\n\n59\n00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,390\nadding user accounts and removing\nuser accounts, managing Google Drive,\n\n60\n00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,090\nmanaging security, all the other\npieces inside of Google Apps.\n\n61\n00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610\nIt's important stuff to know, and\n\n62\n00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,820\nif you've not worked with this environment\nbefore, it's a great way to learn.\n\n63\n00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,070\nNow, if you wanna get the certification,\nsome of you don't,\n\n64\n00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,270\nsome of you just wanna learn how to\nuse Google apps, and that's great.\n\n65\n00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,980\nBut if you wanna get the certification,\n\n66\n00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,910\nit's a pretty straight forward process,\nthe test itself costs $100.\n\n67\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,800\nSo, it's not as high priced as some of\nthe other exams that are out there, but\n\n68\n00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,150\nthe part that I like best is that\nit's not a multiple choice exam.\n\n69\n00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,414\nInstead, it's a hands on practical exam,\nwhen you sign up for this,\n\n70\n00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:19,625\nyou're gonna be logging into\na temporary Google Apps environment.\n\n71\n00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,773\nAn account they've set up just for\nyou, and they'll give you a series of\n\n72\n00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:28,669\nscenario-based statements, not questions,\nreally like config documentation,\n\n73\n00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,021\nsaying we need you to set up this\norganization and these sub organizations,\n\n74\n00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:37,610\nand make sure you set this password\npolicy for this organization.\n\n75\n00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,100\nSo, they're telling you what to do,\nand then you do it, you log in and\n\n76\n00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,280\nyou actually get in there and\n\n77\n00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,870\nwork with the software to put\nthe configuration in place.\n\n78\n00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,230\nNow, they don't care how you do it,\nwhen you're done, when you submit that\n\n79\n00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,240\nexam to be graded, they run some scripts\nto look at what's the final product.\n\n80\n00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,330\nThey don't care, which way you achieved\nyour goal, they just care about the goal.\n\n81\n00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,170\nIf they ask you to set a password policy,\nand you use the GUI to do it, wonderful,\n\n82\n00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,450\nif you used an API call to do it,\nwonderful, they don't care.\n\n83\n00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,639\nBut a check to make sure that the end\nresult is what was right, and\n\n84\n00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,308\nthen if it is, you pass the exam.\n\n85\n00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:15,470\nSo, I really enjoyed that, that was\na breath of fresh air compared to other\n\n86\n00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,780\nexams that are multiple choice, or\ndrag and drop, or fake user interfaces.\n\n87\n00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,130\nI hate those, when they give you some\nkind of like flash animation, and\n\n88\n00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,850\nyou pretend like you're in the UI.\n\n89\n00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,390\nHere it's the actual product, really cool.\n\n90\n00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,840\nA little bit more about the exam,\nI said it's $100, and\n\n91\n00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,900\nit's a practical exam, you can take\nit from anywhere in the world.\n\n92\n00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,150\nYou don't have to go to testing center to\ndo it, you can take it from your own desk.\n\n93\n00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,160\nYou'll log in to an actual Google Apps\nenvironment that they built custom,\n\n94\n00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,750\njust for you.\n\n95\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,790\nIt's a two hour exam, so\nwhen you start the exam,\n\n96\n00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,230\nyou've got two hours to get it completed.\n\n97\n00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,320\nAnd when you're exam timer starts,\n\n98\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,960\nwhen you hit that Start button,\nyou'll get access to a Google Drive share\n\n99\n00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,880\nthat has a couple of documents in\nit that are telling you what to do.\n\n100\n00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,695\nAll the different actions\nthat you need to perform, and\n\n101\n00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,990\nthey're broken up into sections.\n\n102\n00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,160\nThey start with activities that\nmight take a long time to implement\n\n103\n00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,380\nbecause you've only got two hours, and\nyou need to get started on those first.\n\n104\n00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,630\nAnd then they break it up by section for\nother one's, so if you get hung up on\n\n105\n00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,370\nsomething and you can't do it, you can\nskip past it and work on other things.\n\n106\n00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,490\nSome of them are interrelated, but most of\nthem aren't, that way if you're stuck at\n\n107\n00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,340\none point, you don't just have to\ngive up on the rest of the exam and\n\n108\n00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,720\nfail, you can skip over it, work on\nthe other things, and come back later, and\n\n109\n00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800\ntry and\nfix that part that you were stuck on.\n\n110\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,170\nSo, that's kind of a nice thing too,\nbut you work on the environment and\n\n111\n00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,150\nwhen your two hours are up,\nyou lose access to your documents, and\n\n112\n00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,060\nyou lose access to the environment.\n\n113\n00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,050\nThey'll grade your exam right then,\nand you'll find out,\n\n114\n00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,350\nit's almost instantaneous that you'll\nfind out whether you passed or failed.\n\n115\n00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,089\nIt only takes a moment for\ntheir scripts to run to grade it.\n\n116\n00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,339\nNow, because the exam is done in\nan actual Google Apps environment,\n\n117\n00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,400\nit takes a little while\nto get that set up.\n\n118\n00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,750\nSo, when you register for\nthe exam, and you pay for it, and\n\n119\n00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,970\nyou schedule to take it,\nyou'll get a notice saying, hey,\n\n120\n00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,530\nit could take up to 48 hours to build\nthe environment, and get it ready for you.\n\n121\n00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,580\nSo, if you're planning on\ntaking the test tomorrow,\n\n122\n00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,270\nyou really should have signed up for\nit yesterday.\n\n123\n00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,600\nSo, don't expect to be able to take\nthe test the same day that you\n\n124\n00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720\nregister for it.\n\n125\n00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,220\nIt could take up to 48 hours now,\n\n126\n00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,870\nI'll tell you from my experience,\nit's usually much less.\n\n127\n00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,280\nI think it took about four hours for\nme, so it was ready pretty quickly, but\n\n128\n00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,650\ndon't bank on that,\nit depends on how busy they are and\n\n129\n00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,590\nhow much activity is in the system.\n\n130\n00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,320\nSo, if you wanna take the exam on Monday,\nyou should probably register for\n\n131\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,690\nit on a Saturday,\nthat way you know it'll be ready.\n\n132\n00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,140\nNow, once it's ready,\nyou have a window of time,\n\n133\n00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,660\nI believe it's seven days or,\ndo I have that written down?\n\n134\n00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,930\nI don't.\nI believe it's seven days to actually take\n\n135\n00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,020\nthe exam, and\n\n136\n00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,140\nwhen you click the start button,\nthat's when your two hour window starts.\n\n137\n00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,980\nNow, you might get disconnected,\nduring my exam I actually did\n\n138\n00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,200\nget disconnected at one point,\nmy user credentials stopped working.\n\n139\n00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,910\nI had to just log out and log back in,\nand it remembers exactly where you were.\n\n140\n00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,940\nIt's Google Apps,\n\n141\n00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,800\nyou don't lose your settings just\nbecause you got disconnected.\n\n142\n00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,060\nSo, don't worry about that, but\nif you do get disconnected,\n\n143\n00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,300\nyou still have that two hour\nwindow that you're operating in.\n\n144\n00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,820\nSo, just because you got disconnected,\ndoesn't mean the timer has stopped\n\n145\n00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,395\nrunning, you need to get back in there as\nquickly as you can, and continue working.\n\n146\n00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,228\nNow, during the exam, you have all\nthe tools that you would normally have\n\n147\n00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,277\nat your disposal, you're in a web browser.\n\n148\n00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:28,749\nSo, if you forget how to do something\nyou can pull the documentation up, and\n\n149\n00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:29,410\nfind out how.\n\n150\n00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,971\nThat sounds great, the easiest exam ever,\nit's open book, but\n\n151\n00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,885\nthe amount of time you spend searching for\nan answer,\n\n152\n00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,420\ncould be the difference between\nyou passing in failing.\n\n153\n00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,010\nIf you know how to do something, you can\njump right to it, and answer it, and\n\n154\n00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,020\nyou're in business.\n\n155\n00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,920\nIf you're looking in\nthe help documentation,\n\n156\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,410\nyou'll likely run out of time, so\ndon't rely on that as a crutch,\n\n157\n00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,340\nyou wanna make sure you're ready for\nthe topics.\n\n158\n00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,620\nThe only real requirement for your PC,\nbecause you can be on a Mac, or\n\n159\n00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,850\na Windows machine, or whatever,\nthey do require you to have a web camera.\n\n160\n00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,940\nDuring the exam it'll take your picture,\n\n161\n00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,390\nright at the beginning of the exam,\nand throughout the exam it'll take\n\n162\n00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,620\nrandom pictures to ensure that\nyou're the person taking the test.\n\n163\n00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,320\nSo, you do need a web camera to take it,\n\n164\n00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,290\nbut other than that you just need a web\nbrowser, preferably Google Chrome, and\n\n165\n00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,720\nyou can log in, take the exam,\nand do everything that you need.\n\n166\n00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,101\nSo, that's a little bit about the exam,\nonce you've signed up and you take it,\n\n167\n00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:27,546\nyou pass, and you'll get certificates\nin the mail a few days later, but\n\n168\n00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:30,963\nyou get immediate notification that\nyou pass, so really nice to have.\n\n169\n00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:34,124\nIf for some reason you don't\npass on the first attempt,\n\n170\n00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:38,629\nthen you have to wait 14 days in between\nattempts, so basically, two weeks,\n\n171\n00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,690\nif you fail, you've got to wait two\nweeks to be able to repeat the exam.\n\n172\n00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,660\nThat's really about it for\n\n173\n00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,490\nrequirements on the exam,\nit does cover a wide breadth of topics.\n\n174\n00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,790\nYou'll see they have the Administrator\nExam FAQ right here, where they layout\n\n175\n00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,980\nsome basic information here, which is\nbasically what I was just talking about.\n\n176\n00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,030\nBut there's also\nthe Administrator Study Guide, and\n\n177\n00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,180\nthis shows you everything\nthat's on the exam.\n\n178\n00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,820\nIt starts out with managing user accounts,\nthat accounts for 23% of the exam.\n\n179\n00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,020\nYou'll see organizational units,\nwhich are only about 10% of the exam.\n\n180\n00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,960\nGoogle App service and\norganizational access,\n\n181\n00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,700\nso which services you allow to be\nused by your users, that's 14%.\n\n182\n00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,649\nMail delivery routing and filtering,\nyou'll learn about spam filtering, and\n\n183\n00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,504\ne-mail domain attachment,\nand so on, that's 18%.\n\n184\n00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,850\nCalendar setting are 7%.\n\n185\n00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,508\nMobile policies, that's getting to be\na real important thing for businesses,\n\n186\n00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,430\nthat's 8%.\n\n187\n00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,260\nAnd then lastly, sorry not lastly.\n\n188\n00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,390\nThen we've got security,\nwhich is 10% and groups.\n\n189\n00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,170\nI said lastly cuz I always think\nof groups as part of security.\n\n190\n00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,790\nBut security and groups are the remaining\n10% there, is what the exam covers.\n\n191\n00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,410\nThey are very open about this.\n\n192\n00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,890\nThis exam study guide is\nreally all you need to study.\n\n193\n00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,740\nEvery question,\n\n194\n00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,508\neverything that they ask you to do on\nthe exam is right here in the guide.\n\n195\n00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:01,840\nIf you wanna learn about deploying users,\nyou can come in, and pull this up, and\n\n196\n00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,570\nit will show all the different\nways that we can add users, and\n\n197\n00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,570\nyou can read through that documentation.\n\n198\n00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,270\nHere on the show what we're doing is that\nwe're turning that into a concise format,\n\n199\n00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,520\nso you can watch instead of having\nto read through page after page.\n\n200\n00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,310\nAnd so during the course of the show I'll\ndemonstrate how to do all these things.\n\n201\n00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,930\nI'll show you where to go in Google apps,\nand how to configure and\n\n202\n00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,280\nmodify these settings, and\n\n203\n00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,790\nhow to get them put in place in different\nscenarios, but it's all right here.\n\n204\n00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,510\nSo, this is really a nice certification in\nthat the material right here is available,\n\n205\n00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,860\nthey're very honest about what's gonna\nbe on the exam, it's all right here.\n\n206\n00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,784\nIt's pretty pleasant experience compared\nto some of the other vendors that\n\n207\n00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:38,385\nare out there.\n\n208\n00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,224\nNow, if you wanna practice\nto get ready for this exam,\n\n209\n00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:45,300\nyou know from the administrator guide\nthe topics that are gonna be on there, so\n\n210\n00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,870\nyou know the type of stuff\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n211\n00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,796\nThese maybe things that you're not used\nto, you haven't worked with before,\n\n212\n00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:55,898\nmaybe you haven't worked with Google Apps\nbefore, or maybe you have Google Apps in\n\n213\n00:11:55,898 --> 00:12:00,390\nyour company but you haven't used some\nof the features they're talking about.\n\n214\n00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,470\nWell, you don't want to mess with\nyour production environment,\n\n215\n00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,500\ndon't mess with your company's Google Apps\naccount, instead you can sign up for\n\n216\n00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,350\na demo account, Google does a 30\nday free trial of Google Apps.\n\n217\n00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,750\nYou can sign up for it, and you'll have 30\ndays access to a Google Apps environment,\n\n218\n00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,050\nto be able to jump in and work with,\nto experiment, and practice.\n\n219\n00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,886\nSo, if you want one, and I'll post\nthe link to this with the show also.\n\n220\n00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,889\nYou can go the Google Apps for Enterprise\nbusinesses, and you can go in there and\n\n221\n00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,592\nstart a free trial, that'll have\nthe 30 day free trial that you can do,\n\n222\n00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:36,458\nno commitment, you don't even have to\nput in payment information to do it.\n\n223\n00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,340\nSo, there's really no reason not\nto sign up for one of these.\n\n224\n00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,100\nThey give you a trial environment\nwhere you can experiment with all of\n\n225\n00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100\nthe different things that\nmight be on the exam.\n\n226\n00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100\nAll you have to do is click\nStart Free Trial, and\n\n227\n00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,680\nit'll ask you to punch in\nan existing email address.\n\n228\n00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,730\nAnd then you can specify what domain\nyou want to use, so for example,\n\n229\n00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,550\nhere with this one, it's asking me\nto put in first name, last name, and\n\n230\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,480\nI'm gonna put in Don Pezet,\nhere I'll be don@ITproTV,\n\n231\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,230\nand then it says,\nwhat your business organization is.\n\n232\n00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,550\nSo, maybe I'll call this the ITProTV Lab.\n\n233\n00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,015\nNumber of employees, I'll say two to nine,\nyou don't really need more.\n\n234\n00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,140\nYou do need to put a phone number in for\nthem to be able to contact you,\n\n235\n00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,970\nso I'll put in my office number.\n\n236\n00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,370\nThen it's gonna ask you whether\nwe're gonna use a domain address\n\n237\n00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,330\nthat we already have, or\none that we're gonna buy.\n\n238\n00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,070\nSince this is just a trial, you probably,\ndon't wanna buy a domain just for\n\n239\n00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,990\nyour trial.\n\n240\n00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,509\nSo, you may choose to use a domain\nname you've already got, and\n\n241\n00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,357\nyou punch it in here.\n\n242\n00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,924\nSo, I'm gonna say, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n243\n00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:42,593\nSo, that's gonna be the domain\nthat I use for this, and\n\n244\n00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:46,000\nyou can really put in\nwhatever you want there.\n\n245\n00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,950\nIf you put in some fake domain\nthat you don't own, that's okay,\n\n246\n00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,350\nyou just won't be able to activate.\n\n247\n00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,230\nYou won't actually be able to\nget email service in it, but for\n\n248\n00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,860\nexperimenting with the topics that\nare on the exam, that's fine, or\n\n249\n00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,130\nif you did pick a domain you actually own,\nthen you can attach that to it.\n\n250\n00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,930\nAnd you'll be able to do email flow, and\nactually use the Google Apps account,\n\n251\n00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,379\nthat's a nice thing to be able to do.\n\n252\n00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,990\nSo, it's gonna ask me for a user name,\nI'll just punch in, I'll do dpezet, and\n\n253\n00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,250\na password to use for the site,\nso I'll punch in a password,\n\n254\n00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,280\nand then I've gotto pass their CAPTCHA\nwhich I don't know if you guys this.\n\n255\n00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,611\nI'm not exactly quite sure what that\nfirst letter is, that might be an x,\n\n256\n00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,975\nlet's just give that a shot.\n\n257\n00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:31,316\nThis is gonna be the most challenging\npart here, is just passing that.\n\n258\n00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:35,477\nI'll go ahead, and accept their agreement.\n\n259\n00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,719\nI got the CAPTCHA wrong.\n\n260\n00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,484\nLet's try it again.\n\n261\n00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:43,304\nThis been the longest segment of the show,\nright here,\n\n262\n00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:47,006\njust trying to get pass\nin the little test.\n\n263\n00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,098\nGotta love these CAPTCHA things.\n\n264\n00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:48,899\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,500\nSo, it's gonna create that account.\n\n266\n00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,660\nNow, while you're in a trial,\nit can work if you attach your domain.\n\n267\n00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,719\nYeah, my accounts for the other shows,\nso I need to switch accounts, but\n\n268\n00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,661\nI guess [INAUDIBLE] from the other show,\nso I need the switch account.\n\n269\n00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:04,393\nSo, I'm gonna log in as that account,\nlab.itpro.tv, and\n\n270\n00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,760\nI'll punch in that password.\n\n271\n00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,470\nThere we go, and [LAUGH] we've detected\nunusual activity on your account,\n\n272\n00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,150\nand that's just because I have logged\nin multiple times on this machine.\n\n273\n00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,900\nBut normally, you'll get pass that, and it\nwill take you right into your Google Apps\n\n274\n00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,615\nconsole, and\nyou're now set up with a 30 day account.\n\n275\n00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:27,270\nSo, I could punch in my account, and\ndo an automated call and verify it.\n\n276\n00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,900\nI won't make you guys wait through that.\n\n277\n00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,830\nBut basically, once you're logged in,\nyou'll be at your Google Apps console, and\n\n278\n00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,700\nyou'll have 30 days.\n\n279\n00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,470\nAt the end of 30 days,\nyour account will be disabled and\n\n280\n00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,810\nshut off, unless you put payment\ninformation, and start paying.\n\n281\n00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,570\nYou convert to a pay account,\nbut for just practicing for\n\n282\n00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,420\nthe exam, you just use it for\n30 days, then it goes away.\n\n283\n00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,120\nThat's actually, the exact thing they're\ndoing for your exam, when you do the real\n\n284\n00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800\nexam, and you're doing practical\nenvironment it's just a trial\n\n285\n00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,650\naccount basically, that's gonna run for\nthe few hours that your exam is active.\n\n286\n00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,030\nSo, easy to do, jump right in,\nget that set up with a trial, and\n\n287\n00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,590\nyou'll be ready to go for practicing.\n\n288\n00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,070\nIf your 30 days run up, you can\nalways set up another trial account.\n\n289\n00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,290\nI've already got one, actually,\nI think I've got two or three of them, so\n\n290\n00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,590\nthis would be a fourth one now,\n\n291\n00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,340\nwhich might be why it set off\nthe little phone number prompt there.\n\n292\n00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,960\nBut basically, you can get these set up,\nand go in and experiment.\n\n293\n00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,910\nIf you set up a bunch of them, they always\nworry about you maybe retransmitting spam\n\n294\n00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,630\nthrough them,
