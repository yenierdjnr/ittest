[CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.700\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.880\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.972\nAnd today, we are continuing through our\nepisode on GIA Security Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:22.745\nYeah, GIA, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:26.620\nI don't even know if I'm gonna get this\nright ever through the whole entire thing.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.090\nIt's GSAC, and\nthat's the GIAC Security Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.140\nAnd before I ruin that acronym anymore,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.260\nbring Mike Roderick up here.\n\n11\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.260\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, it is a mouthful.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.980\nIt's a lot to say.\n\n14\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.161\nBut this is the GIAC, the Global\nInformation Assurance Certification, GIAC.\n\n15\n00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.786\nAnd then one of the certifications,\n\n16\n00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:52.390\nthat's basically the overall governing\nbody, if you will, the GIAC.\n\n17\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.850\nAnd then they've created their\ncertifications, one of them being GSEC,\n\n18\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.200\nor Security Essentials,\nGIAC Security Essentials, or GSEC.\n\n19\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.930\nThat's what we're doing today.\n\n20\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.100\nAnd in this particular one,\n\n21\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.710\nwhere we're basically starting\nwith our network fundamentals.\n\n22\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.506\nSo we're gonna start at the beginning and\nkinda work our way through.\n\n23\n00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:14.430\nThis is cuz of a different class and the\nfact that we do a broad range of stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.115\nWhen we're studying for GSEC, we have\nto be familiar with everything from\n\n25\n00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.930\nthe fundamentals up to some\nof the more advanced topics.\n\n26\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.348\nAnd so as we go through this, you might\nthink, wow, that's really simple,\n\n27\n00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:25.250\nwhat class is this?\n\n28\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.020\nOr that's really advanced.\n\n29\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.220\nKeep in mind that this\nkind of covers a lot,\n\n30\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.230\nit's got a broad base of knowledge for\nthis exam, if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.425\nSo, we're gonna start in the beginning,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.519\nwe're gonna do our network fundamentals.\n\n33\n00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.096\nSome terminology that we\nneed to be familiar with and\n\n34\n00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:44.138\njust some basic network and concepts that\nwithout, you can't secure a network,\n\n35\n00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:45.677\nyou cannot secure your nodes.\n\n36\n00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:48.635\nYou can't secure your enterprise\nif you don't understand\n\n37\n00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:50.180\nthe basic fundamentals of it.\n\n38\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.100\nYou can't communicate efficiently with\nother people when you're talking about\n\n39\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.420\nproblems or issues or\nideas if you don't have that terminology.\n\n40\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.230\nSo always important to start with\nthat foundational knowledge,\n\n41\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.190\nand we're gonna start with\nbasically network types, right?\n\n42\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.200\nWe need to be familiar when we’re talking\nabout our network, and somebody says,\n\n43\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.000\nwell, are you talking about your LAN?\n\n44\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.790\nOr are you talking about your WAN?\n\n45\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.990\nWhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n46\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.250\nSo those are some acronyms that I just\nthrew out at you, and let’s define them.\n\n47\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.782\nWe’re gonna start with LAN,\nL-A-N, or local area network.\n\n48\n00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:25.089\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\nI’ve got a little drawing that kinda\n\n49\n00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.420\nrepresents, or supposed to represent,\na local area network.\n\n50\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.140\nAnd Wes, I know when I define a local area\nnetwork, it's basically everything that's\n\n51\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.290\nin my little geographical region,\nlike my building here.\n\n52\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.900\nAnd you can see in this drawing\nI've got a router, some switches.\n\n53\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.752\nI got a client subnet over here.\n\n54\n00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:46.380\nI've got maybe a server backbone,\na wireless access point, wireless clients.\n\n55\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.750\nBut those are all here in this building.\n\n56\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.450\nThis building might be a single-floor,\nit might be multiple floors.\n\n57\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.710\nRight, but it's one geographic location.\n\n58\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.282\nRight, and that's typically how I\ndefine a local area network, right?\n\n59\n00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n60\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.020\nI think about that geographic location in\na privately owned, self-contained network.\n\n61\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.009\nAnd what I mean by that is both Mike and\nI,\n\n62\n00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.190\nwell, we have our own local area networks.\n\n63\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.495\nHe's got one at his house, and I've been\non it before, whether he knows it or not.\n\n64\n00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've got one at my house, but\n\n65\n00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.620\nthey're self contained, and\nthey are private entities.\n\n66\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.340\nWhich means he's gonna manage\nhis local area network,\n\n67\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.070\njust like I'm gonna manage mine.\n\n68\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.715\nIt doesn't have to be a home\nnetwork either, right?\n\n69\n00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.390\nThis could also,\nwhere we're going with this,\n\n70\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.810\nis that this could also be in\na business environment as well.\n\n71\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwe've got our local area network,\n\n72\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.650\neverything that's kinda, like you said,\nunder one management, all tied together.\n\n73\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.676\nAnd the big key here is using LAN\nprotocols, which we haven't come to yet.\n\n74\n00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.520\nWe're gonna talk about\nthose in just a minute.\n\n75\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.438\nBut there's a set of protocols that\nwe'll use on our local area network.\n\n76\n00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:50.060\nAll right, now your local area network\ncan take some different forms, right?\n\n77\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.769\nI've got this part back\nhere labeled intranet,\n\n78\n00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.160\nyou can see it's kinda behind a firewall.\n\n79\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.590\nThis is a very typical\nsmall business environment,\n\n80\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.950\nwe've got a firewall protecting\nyourself from the outside.\n\n81\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.360\nHelping me control that traffic that's\ncoming into my local area network.\n\n82\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.570\nCuz we're attached to the outside world,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.952\nVery few networks are not attached to\nthe world wide web, to the Internet.\n\n84\n00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.060\nSo I can get out there and\ngain access to other resources.\n\n85\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.040\nBut behind that firewall,\nthat's my local area network.\n\n86\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.020\nEverything back there is under one\nset of administrative control.\n\n87\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.960\nNow your local area network\nmight include some other parts.\n\n88\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.620\nYou might have a second firewall\nin between you and the Internet.\n\n89\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.650\nAnd between those firewalls, there's\na little space, I've got two, right?\n\n90\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.901\nI've got one back here, I've got one here,\n\n91\n00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.470\nthe Internet would be\nout here to the right.\n\n92\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.588\nSo as traffic comes in,\nit goes through this first firewall, and\n\n93\n00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:43.640\nit kind of gets to this intermediate area.\n\n94\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.858\nAnd then if allowed,\n\n95\n00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:49.230\nit might go through that second\nfirewall back to my corporate network.\n\n96\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.660\nAnd same thing for\ntraffic that's leaving my network.\n\n97\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.510\nThey're gonna go through that first\nfirewall, through this little area here,\n\n98\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.480\nand out through that second\nfirewall to the Internet.\n\n99\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.190\n&gt;&gt; And Mike,\n\n100\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060\nhelp me out here because you already\nhelped us with the one acronym there.\n\n101\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.460\nI see LAN, and\nit is defined as local area network.\n\n102\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.230\nI also see three sets of letters\nup there as well called a DMZ.\n\n103\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.340\nYou wanna help me out with that one?\n\n104\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.787\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea, I just type those out.\n\n105\n00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:16.590\nNo, a DMZ is the name I'm gonna give\nthat area between those two firewalls.\n\n106\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.910\nIt's known as a demilitarized zone.\n\n107\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.910\nIt has other names,\ndepending on who you're talking to or\n\n108\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.240\nwhat book you're reading.\n\n109\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.270\nYou might see it referenced as\na screened subnet, right, so\n\n110\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.600\na subnet between those two firewalls.\n\n111\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.900\nYou also might see it referenced\nas a perimeter network,\n\n112\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.790\nbecause it is on the perimeter\nof your network.\n\n113\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.000\nAnd just like a demilitarized zone\nin the physical world, right,\n\n114\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.380\nit's like a buffer space there.\n\n115\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.430\nThis is an area of my network that I'm\ngonna allow certain things to happen\n\n116\n00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.620\nthat I would not allow on my Internet,\nback here behind this second firewall.\n\n117\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.330\nFor example, I've got a website.\n\n118\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.250\nPeople come to my website to buy\nmy product, so I can make money.\n\n119\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.160\nSo I need to allow public,\nanonymous access to that website.\n\n120\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.130\nWell, I can't allow\npublic anonymous access\n\n121\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.330\nto my internal network on\nmy corporate LAN, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.100\nSo there,\nyou start to see some of the differences.\n\n123\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.660\nOn this front firewall, it's not\ngonna be configured quite as strict.\n\n124\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.510\nIt's gonna allow certain things through,\n\n125\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.430\nlike that public anonymous\naccess to that web front-end.\n\n126\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.890\nThis back firewall is gonna be\nconfigured a lot more stringent.\n\n127\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.140\nIt's not gonna allow that\nkind of thing through.\n\n128\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.330\nOnly certain machines or certain traffic\nis gonna be allowed to actually penetrate\n\n129\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.600\ninto the corporate network back here,\nthat private part, my intranet.\n\n130\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.960\nSo whatever you call it, DMZ,\nscreened subnet, perimeter network,\n\n131\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.320\nit acts as a little bit of buffer\nbetween you and the outside world.\n\n132\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.100\nIt's also where we put our\nresources that need public access.\n\n133\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.530\nOr another one you might see is\nwhat's called an extranet, right?\n\n134\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.280\nVery similar to what I've\ngot drawn here with the DMZ.\n\n135\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.770\nI might have a partner organization.\n\n136\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.340\nAnd maybe I'm a supplier of raw materials,\nand\n\n137\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.350\nthey're a manufacturer and\nthey need to purchase this stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.630\nAnd so I set up an area of my network\nwhere their employees can come in and\n\n139\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.880\nsee how much raw materials we have,\nplace orders, and look at ship dates and\n\n140\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.182\nthings like that.\n\n141\n00:07:14.182 --> 00:07:18.930\nI wanna provide that to them, but I don't\nwant that company's employees coming into\n\n142\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.950\nmy local area network back into\nmy intranet, don't need that.\n\n143\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.960\nSo I make it part of my network,\nnot quite publicly available.\n\n144\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920\nIt's like the screen subnet or a DMZ\nmight be available to anonymous access.\n\n145\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.560\nMy extranet is only available\nto Company XYZ from the outside.\n\n146\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.880\nOr I probably have several\npeople that I sell to.\n\n147\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.530\nSo my entire list of companies\nthat I provide raw materials to,\n\n148\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.820\nthey might have access to my extranet.\n\n149\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.321\nThe public's not allowed\ninto the extranet, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:56.471\nSo it's a part of my network that I can\nmake available to the outside basically.\n\n151\n00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.996\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now that local area network that\nyou've got in your diagram there, or\n\n152\n00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:03.865\nthe intranet as you've been talking about,\nI notice you got a few devices in there.\n\n153\n00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:08.441\nAnd does it matter whether I'm\na A small home environment.\n\n154\n00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:11.440\nWe're not talking business here or\na corporate environment.\n\n155\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.980\nLAN generally is not restricted,\n\n156\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.040\nor is it, to the amount of\ndevices you have on that network.\n\n157\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.800\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n158\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.010\nIt can be just a single node\nback there with no firewall.\n\n159\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.960\nMaybe you've got a router that you\npicked up from your cable provider or\n\n160\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.940\nyour Internet service provider and\nthen you plug straight into that.\n\n161\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.780\nHopefully not.\n\n162\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.690\nHopefully you know better than that.\n\n163\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.690\nBut then you've got at least some kind of\nrouter and or switch sitting back there.\n\n164\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.170\nBut absolutely,\na single node would still be an intranet.\n\n165\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.410\nIt would still be using LAN-based\nprotocols to communicate with, well,\n\n166\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.060\nnobody else.\n\n167\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.740\nBut let's say you added a second node,\nright?\n\n168\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.480\nAnd now your LAN is\na little more functional.\n\n169\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.000\nBut even with a single node you\nwould still be considered a LAN.\n\n170\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.800\nSo it's really all about the fact that\nit's under my administrative control and\n\n171\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.730\nthat it's geographically in one spot,\nI guess.\n\n172\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.750\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm watching this for the very\nfirst time, I don't have to worry about\n\n173\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.260\nbeing confused if this is a LAN because\nit has XYZ devices versus this is\n\n174\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.210\na LAN because it's got three floors and\nit's a corporate owned entity.\n\n175\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.610\nIt's just like you said,\ngeographical location and\n\n176\n00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.090\njust being under the administrative\ncontrol of or whoever runs the network.\n\n177\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n178\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.210\nAll right so now let's take a step up\nfrom LAN and we're gonna go to WAN.\n\n179\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.420\nSo LAN was local area network.\n\n180\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.850\nWe talk about a WAN,\nwe're talking about a wide area network.\n\n181\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.340\nAnd the names, if you start to pick up\non the names kind of gives you a hint,\n\n182\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.210\nright, wide area.\n\n183\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.280\nThat tells me it's probably gonna be\na little more geographically dispersed.\n\n184\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.410\nAnd so what I've got on my screen\nnow is our business has grown.\n\n185\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.480\nWe've got an office in New York.\n\n186\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.010\nWe've got another office in London.\n\n187\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.560\nAnd we've got another office in Sydney.\n\n188\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.310\nNow what you'll notice, or should notice\nhere I can get my mouse to play along.\n\n189\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.400\nIs, let's take just this New York for\na second.\n\n190\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.900\nNotice it looks very similar, right,\nto what we were just looking at for a LAN?\n\n191\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.310\nBecause I've basically copied and\npaste my drawing.\n\n192\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.310\nBecause it is, New York is a LAN,\nthat is a local area network there.\n\n193\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.540\nBut my organization has three of those.\n\n194\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.440\nHas one over here in London and\nanother one in Sydney.\n\n195\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.300\nAnd I apologize.\n\n196\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.110\nI hope I'm not making you sick there.\n\n197\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.360\nWe'll stop with the zooming around.\n\n198\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.220\nSo I've got basically\nthree local area networks.\n\n199\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.670\nOne in London, one in New York,\nAnd one in Sydney.\n\n200\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.360\nNow I need to tie these guys together,\nbecause people in London need to access\n\n201\n00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.620\nresources in New York and\nSydney and vise versa.\n\n202\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.630\nSo when we start bringing\nthese office together,\n\n203\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:44.230\nstart connecting them, now we're talking\nabout our wide area network, all right?\n\n204\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.185\nWide area networks or\nWANs travel across or\n\n205\n00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:54.160\ndesigned to connect geographically\ndispersed locations, all right.\n\n206\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160\nThey do use a different set of protocols\nwhich will come too here in just a minute.\n\n207\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.448\nI wanna make sure we get\nthe concept down first.\n\n208\n00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo wide area network is really\nnothing more than an collection of\n\n209\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.970\nlocal area networks kinda connected\ntogether cuz we have enterprise admins.\n\n210\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.630\nSo New York is under my control.\n\n211\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.460\nLondon is also under my control.\n\n212\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.410\nSydney is also under my control.\n\n213\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.500\nAnd by our definition of LAN,\nwe said if it was a network under a single\n\n214\n00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.010\nadministrative control,\nit should be a LAN.\n\n215\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.750\nIt was the second part of that LAN\ndefinition that's getting us, right?\n\n216\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.740\nIt's not in a geographic or\nsingle geographic location.\n\n217\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.920\nNow we're talking about\nthree different locations.\n\n218\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.610\nSo still under one administrative control\nbut now I'm geographically dispersed.\n\n219\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.160\nNow were talking about\nthe wide area network.\n\n220\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.964\nAnd we do have to be a little bit\ncareful with this because really when\n\n221\n00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:42.903\nwe talk about the wide area network,\nwe're talking about this part,\n\n222\n00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:45.440\nthe stuff that's in\nfront of this firewall,\n\n223\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.229\nits all of the things that are connecting\nthese three local area networks together.\n\n224\n00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:55.500\nThis is still my LAN back here,\nthis is another LAN, this is another LAN.\n\n225\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.850\nIt's a separate set of technologies\nthat's connecting those LANs and\n\n226\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.220\ncreating my WAN, or my wide area network.\n\n227\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.880\nWe have separate administrators and\nin a larger environment,\n\n228\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.570\nI know a lot of us are in the smaller\nshops and we wear all the hats.\n\n229\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.020\nBut in some organizations,\n\n230\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.850\nyou have LAN administrators that deal with\nLAN protocols and LAN troubleshooting.\n\n231\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.460\nYou also have WAN administrators that\ndeal with the WAN side of things.\n\n232\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.610\nAnd when they're troubleshooting,\nthey look at this demarcation point here,\n\n233\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.630\nthis firewall, and that's how they decide.\n\n234\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.520\nIf it's on one side of the firewall,\nhey LAN admins, it's your problem,\n\n235\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.160\nyou deal with it.\n\n236\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.970\nIf it's on the other side of the firewall,\nhey WAN admins,\n\n237\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.730\nit's your problem,\nyou deal with it, right?\n\n238\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.650\nSo the WAN is that wide area network\nthat's tieing those local area\n\n239\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.640\nnetworks together.\n\n240\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.720\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned the connections.\n\n241\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.800\nSo, Mike, when you say that, hey, it's\non your side, you take care of it, hey,\n\n242\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.530\nit's on your side, you take care of it,\n\n243\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.490\nyou're not really necessarily talking\nabout just the point of responsibility.\n\n244\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.530\nBut you've already mentioned that these\ncommunication types are completely\n\n245\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.120\ndifferent, so one set of\ncommunication protocols is gonna be\n\n246\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.740\nhandled by one set of administrators\nversus somebody else.\n\n247\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.410\nI did have another question,\nbecause you and I both have LANs, right?\n\n248\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n249\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.500\nWhy is, would that be considered a WAN?\n\n250\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.200\nOr would that not be considered a WAN?\n\n251\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.360\nYou have your home network,\nI have my home network.\n\n252\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Well we won't tell him, but\nwhen his network's under my control,\n\n253\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.445\nwhich is after midnight typically,\nthen it's a WAN.\n\n254\n00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:14.090\n[LAUGH] Very good question.\n\n255\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.650\nAnd no,\n\n256\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.830\nit's not a WAN because it's not under\nthe same administrative control, right.\n\n257\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.020\nYou could consider Wes and\nI, separate organizations.\n\n258\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.570\nWe both have LANs and\n\n259\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.010\nwe're both tied to the same Internet but\nwe're not sharing resources.\n\n260\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.520\nWe're not under the same\nadministrative control so\n\n261\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.090\nwe would not be considered a WAN.\n\n262\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.780\nWe are going across a WAN because\nreally the Internet is a WAN, right?\n\n263\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.990\nBut that wouldn't in itself\nwould be considered a WAN.\n\n264\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.960\nGreat question.\n\n265\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.910\nNow there's some others that I didn't draw\nup that we should probably be familiar\n\n266\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.970\nwith just in case they ask us.\n\n267\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.620\nAnd so we can sound intelligent if\nsomebody else uses these crazy terms.\n\n268\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.200\nI think people just sit up at night and\n\n269\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.670\ndream of ways to expand\nthese acronym bases.\n\n270\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.700\nBut there's something called\na MAN a metropolitan area network\n\n271\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.070\na WAN covers a wide geographical space.\n\n272\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.430\nWhat if I took this offices,\nlet's say this was in New York, but\n\n273\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.940\nthis was actually East New York and\n\n274\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.600\nthis was West New York and\nthis was South New York, all right?\n\n275\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.730\nAnd said of being New York,\nSydney, and London.\n\n276\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.330\nAll right?\n\n277\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.520\nIf they're all three local area networks,\nthree different buildings, three different\n\n278\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.910\ngeographical locations tied together\nwith WAN technologies, but in the same\n\n279\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:32.450\nmetropolitan area, it would be considered\na MAN, a metropolitan area network.\n\n280\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.620\nNow If we get that specific or not,\nI don't think it's all that big of a deal.\n\n281\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.520\nBut it's still using WAN technologies.\n\n282\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.170\nIt's just that we can define the\ngeographic distribution a little better.\n\n283\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.330\nWe can say it's all contained\nwithin this one metropolitan area.\n\n284\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.790\nBut it's still WAN technology.\n\n285\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.690\nSo really a MAN is just a subset of a WAN.\n\n286\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.860\nIt's a different classification\nof a WAN or wide area network.\n\n287\n00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.210\nSame thing we're talking about a CAN or\na campus area network.\n\n288\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.170\nIf I own a lot of property\nlike a university.\n\n289\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.360\nI might have separate LANs at\neach one of my buildings, right?\n\n290\n00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.590\nFood Science building has its own LAN.\n\n291\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.630\nI'm trying to think of some of the others.\n\n292\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.620\nI didn't go to college, no.\n\n293\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.560\nSome of the others,\nyou got Financing over in one building.\n\n294\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.420\nEach one of those can be different LANs.\n\n295\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.650\nTie those together using WAN technologies,\nand now I've got a campus area network.\n\n296\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.680\nAnd really that's why we differentiate.\n\n297\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.780\nWell, because in a metropolitan area\nnetwork, if I'm connecting LANs.\n\n298\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.020\nDifferent buildings in\na metropolitan area,\n\n299\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.130\nI most likely don't own the links between\nthe two buildings in that downtown area.\n\n300\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.465\nOr between downtown east and\ndowntown downtown west.\n\n301\n00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:43.815\nI can't just go and get a ditch digger and\ncut a cable or cut a trench and\n\n302\n00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:48.616\nrun a line between my two buildings,\nright, I've got to go and rent lines or\n\n303\n00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:52.765\nlease lines from somebody with\nthat metropolitan area network.\n\n304\n00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:58.167\nIf it's a university campus or a large\nindustrial park and I own all the land\n\n305\n00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:02.995\nI can now dig a tunnel and not a tunnel\nbut trench and lay down cable.\n\n306\n00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:07.388\nAnd even though I'm using WAN technologies\nto connect those two buildings It's under\n\n307\n00:16:07.388 --> 00:16:08.057\nmy control.\n\n308\n00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:12.278\nSo that's where we would say it's a campus\narea network not a metropolitan area\n\n309\n00:16:12.278 --> 00:16:13.750\nnetwork, all right.\n\n310\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.050\nEven though technically I guess your\ncampus could be a little more dispersed\n\n311\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.980\nthan a metropolitan.\n\n312\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.919\nSo it's really about who owns the lines\nthat are linking those lands at\n\n313\n00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:22.669\nthat point.\n\n314\n00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:23.880\nAnd then there's another one.\n\n315\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.730\nI know, Wes,\nyou're familiar with this one.\n\n316\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.680\nThe whole PAN,\nyou know what that one stands for?\n\n317\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n318\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.933\nThat is a little young kid that\nflies around with pixie dust.\n\n319\n00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:33.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, guys.\n\n320\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.390\nPAN, personal area network.\n\n321\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.359\nAnd I believe we do see this in the realm\nof things like Bluetooth communications,\n\n322\n00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.530\nthat's one that comes to mind?\n\n323\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, right?\n\n324\n00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:44.660\nA lot of us have these now, even though\nwe've probably never heard that term.\n\n325\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.450\nBut a personal area network\nwould be your phone,\n\n326\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.309\ntalking to your headset,\ntalking to your watch,\n\n327\n00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:54.480\nthat also talks to your sneakers to\nkeep track of how far you've walked.\n\n328\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.815\nAll of that is networked together\nusing a radio frequency, Bluetooth,\n\n329\n00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:02.166\nshort wave radio,\nto network those devices together.\n\n330\n00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.150\nAnd they don't communicate.\n\n331\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.023\nWell hopefully if we keep things secure,\n\n332\n00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:08.083\nthey're not communicating with\nWes's phone or Wes's sneakers.\n\n333\n00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:11.383\nRight, that's my own\npersonal area network.\n\n334\n00:17:11.383 --> 00:17:13.704\n&gt;&gt; I've gotta love it when you say my\nsneakers have a network connection.\n\n335\n00:17:13.704 --> 00:17:14.910\nThat's interesting.\n\n336\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.582\nNow I see where you've gone\nhere with the land technology,\n\n337\n00:17:18.582 --> 00:17:20.645\nsingle geographical location.\n\n338\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:24.624\nThe WAN technology multiple\ngeographical locations.\n\n339\n00:17:24.624 --> 00:17:29.304\nMAN, maybe a whole entire\ncity campus owned by a single\n\n340\n00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:32.410\nacademic entity, if you will.\n\n341\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.738\nLet me guess, pan.\n\n342\n00:17:33.738 --> 00:17:36.287\nIts gonna be your personal\ngeographical location.\n\n343\n00:17:36.287 --> 00:17:40.325\n&gt;&gt; That's right, wherever you are,\nIts the network that you take with you.\n\n344\n00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.477\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some of our pan's are larger than\n\n345\n00:17:42.477 --> 00:17:45.170\nothers, I say, you just have to\nlook at my gut and you can tell.\n\n346\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.357\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I was gonna say,\n\n347\n00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:51.102\nbeing six something there six, two,\nhe's got a different frequency that he\n\n348\n00:17:51.102 --> 00:17:53.531\nuses to get from his tennis\nshoes up to his earbud.\n\n349\n00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit longer, so.\n\n350\n00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.203\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n351\n00:17:56.203 --> 00:17:59.475\nthose are some of the network types\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n352\n00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:01.804\nAgain, make yourself flash cards,\ndo what you gotta do.\n\n353\n00:18:01.804 --> 00:18:06.786\nFor LAN, WAN, CAN, MAN, and PAN are the\nfive acronyms that I want you to be\n\n354\n00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:11.140\nfamiliar with as you're preparing for\nthis exam.\n\n355\n00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.510\nAnd just in general.\n\n356\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.970\nAll right, next thing we want to talk\nabout Wes is gonna be network topologies.\n\n357\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.210\nSo within that network,\n\n358\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:24.710\nwe're going to define how these devices,\nlet's get back over to LAN here.\n\n359\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.810\nHow are these devices connected?\n\n360\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.470\nHow they're laid out that's what\nwe call our network topology.\n\n361\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.060\nAnd those are some important\ndecisions that we've gotta make\n\n362\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.010\nif we're setting up a network.\n\n363\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.780\nIt's also important to understand what\nwe're currently using when it's time to\n\n364\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.440\ntroubleshoot.\n\n365\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.020\nWhen we're trying to\nfigure out what is wrong.\n\n366\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.120\nOr when we're trying to\nprotect that network.\n\n367\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.380\nWe need to know that topology.\n\n368\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:53.570\nHow those packets are being transmitted\nback and forth between these devices.\n\n369\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.970\nWhat interconnectivity devices are there.\n\n370\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.030\nWhat they're allowing, what they're\nnot allowing, and things like that.\n\n371\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.476\nSo let's take a look.\n\n372\n00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:04.456\nI have another handy dandy drawing.\n\n373\n00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:06.469\nAnd we don't wanna save any of those.\n\n374\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.560\nFor our topologies.\n\n375\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.440\nAnd this first one, Wes,\nwhat do you call that one?\n\n376\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.620\n&gt;&gt; That one looks like,\n\n377\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.440\nwith the linear format, I'm gonna say\nthat's probably what's known as a bus.\n\n378\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.210\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, sir,\nyou get a gold star for the day.\n\n379\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.190\nThat's gonna be what\nwe call a bus network.\n\n380\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.670\nAnd this is one of the oldest forms, or\n\n381\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.660\none of the oldest topologies we\nhave when it comes to networking.\n\n382\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.950\nWas it ThickNet, I guess, was using, was\na big one with this way back in the day?\n\n383\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.280\nBack when I first started getting\ninto computers and networks.\n\n384\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.360\nWe use something called Thicknet\nthat ran behind the desk.\n\n385\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.629\nSomething we're probably don't\nneed to worry about nowadays.\n\n386\n00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:48.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, unless you're in a museum,\n\n387\n00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:51.886\nI highly doubt you're gonna see anything\non the old Thinnet and Thicknet, for sure.\n\n388\n00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:57.300\nAnd Mike, now, I'm pretty familiar with\nthe fact that these had some problems.\n\n389\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.720\nIn the terms of scalability,\nwere these type of networks scalable to,\n\n390\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.460\nsay if I had a massively\nlarge organization?\n\n391\n00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, it kinda depends on what\nwe're talking about I guess.\n\n392\n00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.274\nLet's talk about some of\nthe good things about this bus,\n\n393\n00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.506\nand we'll see how it scales up, right?\n\n394\n00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:16.040\nOne nice thing about a bus network like\nthis is you have less cables, right?\n\n395\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.380\nI take this one long cable here,\nand I can run\n\n396\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.972\nit around through each one of the offices,\nbehind a row cubicles, or whatever.\n\n397\n00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:27.760\nAnd then when I add a node, I simply\ntake a short cable, run it from the node\n\n398\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.118\nto that cable that's already laying,\nprobably right behind my cubicle there.\n\n399\n00:20:31.118 --> 00:20:33.930\nI just tap it down,\nmaybe old vampire tabs or\n\n400\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.840\na T connector of some kind,\nto connect those together so.\n\n401\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.560\nIn one respect it was kinda nice because\nI had fewer cables to deal with,\n\n402\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.000\nbut the downside of the bus technology or\n\n403\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.260\nthe bus topology I should say,\nis a couple of things.\n\n404\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.290\nOne, they're all connected.\n\n405\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.800\nSo, if we ever have a break in the cable,\n\n406\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.171\nnow let's see if I can draw a break,\nlet's say I break it right here.\n\n407\n00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:03.685\nThat's not very good.\n\n408\n00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:07.250\nLet's make it a little bit bigger so\nwe can see this guy.\n\n409\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:14.310\nLet's say we grab a, kinda like that, and\nwe get a break in the cable there right?\n\n410\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.604\nWes, what's gonna happen to all\nthe communication between these devices?\n\n411\n00:21:18.604 --> 00:21:22.841\n&gt;&gt; I want to say one cable, one break,\nmeans the whole entire network disappears,\n\n412\n00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:24.035\ncommunication wise.\n\n413\n00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n414\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.890\nIf that cable breaks,\neverybody loses communication.\n\n415\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.108\nNow, think about this.\n\n416\n00:21:30.108 --> 00:21:33.630\nWes was saying,\ndoes this scale up to a large network?\n\n417\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.230\nSure, I can take that cable and\n\n418\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.600\nI can run it around behind\neverybody's desk in the building.\n\n419\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.010\nAnd there are some limitations\nto the distance we can go.\n\n420\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.148\nBut let's say theoretically, that we run\nthis cable behind every little office in\n\n421\n00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:48.174\nour entire building and\neverybody's patched down to that.\n\n422\n00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:50.077\nOne little cable break,\n\n423\n00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:54.981\nsomebody rolls over that with\na heavy cart or cable gets kinked.\n\n424\n00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.740\nNow, everybody in the entire\nbuilding has lost communication.\n\n425\n00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.460\nThe entire network is down, right?\n\n426\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.980\nThat was a big problem\nwith these bus networks,\n\n427\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.620\nas I get rid of our little stripe.\n\n428\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.626\nThe other issue that we had run into,\nor we had to deal with,\n\n429\n00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:13.504\nwas these guys needed terminators.\n\n430\n00:22:13.504 --> 00:22:17.443\nWhen we dealt with buses we had to\nterminate the ends now this would actually\n\n431\n00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:19.644\nplug in to something in my server closet.\n\n432\n00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:23.800\nBut we had to make sure we terminated\nthe ends because we would give what was\n\n433\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.956\ncalled, what is the technical term?\n\n434\n00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Signal reflection.\n\n435\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.010\n&gt;&gt; Signal reflection, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.290\nWhen if I speak,\n\n437\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.640\nlet's say this computer sends out some\ndata, that travels both directions.\n\n438\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.250\nDown this line, everybody hears it.\n\n439\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.350\nIf it gets to here and\nthere's no terminator, well it gets\n\n440\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.380\nto the end of this raw line, the signal\nactually starts coming back, and imagine\n\n441\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.650\nyou ever drop something you take a bucket\nof water and you drop something in there.\n\n442\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.120\nYou got these nice neat\nripples going out but\n\n443\n00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200\nas soon as those ripples hit the wall of\nthe bucket, they start reflecting back in.\n\n444\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.330\nNow I've got some ripples\nstill making their way out.\n\n445\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.141\nI've got some ripples coming back in,\nand the ripples start crossing and\n\n446\n00:23:03.141 --> 00:23:05.365\nit gets kinda this weird pattern on there.\n\n447\n00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:07.770\nIt's the exact same thing\nthat's gonna happen here.\n\n448\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.681\nThe problem with our communications,\nwith electronic communications is,\n\n449\n00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:15.713\nthose crossing of the ripples like that\nIt's basically scrambling the data and\n\n450\n00:23:15.713 --> 00:23:18.861\nI'm not going to be able to make\nsense out of what's going on.\n\n451\n00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:23.810\nI'll lose that, what's a good word for\nit, you just can't interpret it.\n\n452\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.630\nSo you can't read the data.\n\n453\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.620\nSo basically nobody can communicate again.\n\n454\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.890\n&gt;&gt; You know I make the joke here that\nyou're probably only going to see them in\n\n455\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.318\na museum, but I was watching some of\nthe earlier days when this was the network\n\n456\n00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:35.819\ntechnology on some kind of show.\n\n457\n00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:39.786\nAnd one of the earlier inventors,\ninventors of this product said, you can\n\n458\n00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:43.421\nalways tell when somebody wanted a break\ncuz all they have to do is reach down and\n\n459\n00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.484\npull one of those\nterminators off the line.\n\n460\n00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:49.389\nAnd then everybody's faces would slowly\ncome up from their cubes wondering why's\n\n461\n00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:50.310\nthe network down.\n\n462\n00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.993\nSo I can see this would be a fun time at\nthe office when this network didn't work.\n\n463\n00:23:53.993 --> 00:23:55.232\n&gt;&gt; And the scary thing was Wes,\n\n464\n00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:57.977\nwhat if I broke this cable here\ndoes that bother my network too?\n\n465\n00:23:57.977 --> 00:23:59.926\n&gt;&gt; It brings the whole network\nto still a single cable.\n\n466\n00:23:59.926 --> 00:24:02.292\n&gt;&gt; That's right cuz this\nwhole thing you can imagine,\n\n467\n00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:04.622\nis the signal going out\nacross all of these cables.\n\n468\n00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:07.931\nSo It's not just a break in the main line.\n\n469\n00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:12.248\nIf Wes wanted that break, [LAUGH]\nliterally, and breaks the cable there,\n\n470\n00:24:12.248 --> 00:24:13.860\nyeah, everybody is down.\n\n471\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.070\nSo buses had their place in history.\n\n472\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.180\nYou don't see them that often anymore.\n\n473\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.820\nLet's move onto a little more modern\nlayout, a little modern topology.\n\n474\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.990\nAnd that's gonna be our star.\n\n475\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.920\nAnd you can see,\n\n476\n00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.990\nit gets the name from the pattern that it\nmakes when we kinda draw it out like this.\n\n477\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.640\nBut the big difference between a bus and\n\n478\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.180\na star is I now have a central\nconnectivity device.\n\n479\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.430\nI have something tying all\nof these things together.\n\n480\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.650\nSo instead of there\nbeing that backbone and\n\n481\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.690\neverybody T-ing into\nthis backbone down here.\n\n482\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:53.392\nWe've got this one device in the middle,\nand everything plugs into that one device.\n\n483\n00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:56.287\nAnd this is what we would\ncall a star topology.\n\n484\n00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:59.047\nNow that device in\nthe middle could be a hub,\n\n485\n00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:01.965\ncould be a switch,\ncould be a bridge, right?\n\n486\n00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:05.170\nWe'll talk about these\ndevices as we go along.\n\n487\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.540\nAdvantages to this layout, well, is\ngoing to be the fact that, what happens,\n\n488\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.440\nWes, if this cable breaks here?\n\n489\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, with a connectivity device,\nI think it isolates just that one\n\n490\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.330\nnode that's connected to the device\nfrom the rest of the network.\n\n491\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.360\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n492\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.250\nSo that one node would be down.\n\n493\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.180\nNobody could communicate with this node.\n\n494\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.060\nThis node could communicate with\nnobody else, but that's it.\n\n495\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.440\nThe other three nodes on this network\nare still communicating just fine.\n\n496\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.260\nSo it ends up creating this point-to-point\nconnection between the node and\n\n497\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.070\nthat central connectivity device.\n\n498\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.240\nWhich eliminates my need for\none, for terminators.\n\n499\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.910\nAnd two, the single cable break\nbrings down the entire network.\n\n500\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:42.610\nFlexibility.\n\n501\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.350\nWhen I need to plug in a new node, as long\nas there's an extra port on this guy,\n\n502\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.180\nI can just pop a new node out here.\n\n503\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.180\nAnd connect it up, and\nwe're good to go, all right?\n\n504\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.428\nDownside is to connect that node,\nI had to make a home run.\n\n505\n00:25:56.428 --> 00:25:58.850\nAnd I'm not talking about hitting\nit out of the park, right?\n\n506\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.200\nI've gotta run a wire from that person's\noffice, that new computer he just got,\n\n507\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.820\nup the wall, over the attic, down in.\n\n508\n00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.410\nWherever that central\nconnectivity device is,\n\n509\n00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.310\nI've gotta connect that\nmachine to it somehow, right?\n\n510\n00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.950\nSo a lot more cable involved when we\ndeal with setting up star topologies.\n\n511\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.009\n&gt;&gt; Now it's interesting, and\nI think you did this on purpose here.\n\n512\n00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:21.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now you showed us the first one which\n\n513\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.179\nwas probably one that we will\nnever really see anymore.\n\n514\n00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:25.690\nBecause it's just not utilize anymore.\n\n515\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.587\nNow this almost is the polar reverse.\n\n516\n00:26:27.587 --> 00:26:30.733\nHow common is this type of\nnetwork in today's day and age?\n\n517\n00:26:30.733 --> 00:26:32.010\n&gt;&gt; This is just about everywhere.\n\n518\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.862\nJust about every network you\nrun into is gonna be switched,\n\n519\n00:26:34.862 --> 00:26:36.905\nwhat they call switched Ethernet.\n\n520\n00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:41.369\nMeaning that we're running star topologies\nwith a central connectivity device.\n\n521\n00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:42.885\nAlmost always a switch.\n\n522\n00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:46.455\nHubs, which we're gonna talk about later,\nyou rarely see those anymore.\n\n523\n00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:49.970\nBridges you really don't see\nthose much anymore except for\n\n524\n00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.802\nin special needs situations.\n\n525\n00:26:51.802 --> 00:26:56.752\nBut to Wes's point, yeah, just about every\nsingle network is gonna be laid out in\n\n526\n00:26:56.752 --> 00:27:00.000\na star using a central\nconnectivity device.\n\n527\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.760\nWell, Mike,\nI know we got a lot more to go.\n\n528\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.610\nYou guys out there that are sharp probably\nseen that we've got a lot more of those\n\n529\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.580\ndiagrams there.\n\n530\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.760\nYou can see all the little tabs.\n\n531\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.750\nBut I'll tell you what we\ndon't have time for right now.\n\n532\n00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.920\nAnd that's the time on that clock.\n\n533\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.567\nSo Mike, were you gonna go ahead and\nwrap this up?\n\n534\n00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.670\nAnd come back in a part two, and\n\n535\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.650\nwe'll continue along in\nour network fundamentals?\n\n536\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.570\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n537\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good, well,\nthat's a perfect place to stop.\n\n538\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.320\nThank you, Mike, for being here.\n\n539\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.832\nWe'll see you guys, hopefully,\nsee you in the next episode.\n\n540\n00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:28.895\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI have been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n541\n00:27:28.895 --> 00:27:29.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n542\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.908\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n543\n00:27:30.908 -->
