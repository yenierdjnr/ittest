[CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.700\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.880\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.972\nAnd today, we are continuing through our\nepisode on GIA Security Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:22.745\nYeah, GIA, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:26.620\nI don't even know if I'm gonna get this\nright ever through the whole entire thing.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.090\nIt's GSAC, and\nthat's the GIAC Security Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.140\nAnd before I ruin that acronym anymore,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.260\nbring Mike Roderick up here.\n\n11\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.260\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, it is a mouthful.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.980\nIt's a lot to say.\n\n14\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.161\nBut this is the GIAC, the Global\nInformation Assurance Certification, GIAC.\n\n15\n00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.786\nAnd then one of the certifications,\n\n16\n00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:52.390\nthat's basically the overall governing\nbody, if you will, the GIAC.\n\n17\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.850\nAnd then they've created their\ncertifications, one of them being GSEC,\n\n18\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.200\nor Security Essentials,\nGIAC Security Essentials, or GSEC.\n\n19\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.930\nThat's what we're doing today.\n\n20\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.100\nAnd in this particular one,\n\n21\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.710\nwhere we're basically starting\nwith our network fundamentals.\n\n22\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.506\nSo we're gonna start at the beginning and\nkinda work our way through.\n\n23\n00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:14.430\nThis is cuz of a different class and the\nfact that we do a broad range of stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.115\nWhen we're studying for GSEC, we have\nto be familiar with everything from\n\n25\n00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.930\nthe fundamentals up to some\nof the more advanced topics.\n\n26\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.348\nAnd so as we go through this, you might\nthink, wow, that's really simple,\n\n27\n00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:25.250\nwhat class is this?\n\n28\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.020\nOr that's really advanced.\n\n29\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.220\nKeep in mind that this\nkind of covers a lot,\n\n30\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.230\nit's got a broad base of knowledge for\nthis exam, if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.425\nSo, we're gonna start in the beginning,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.519\nwe're gonna do our network fundamentals.\n\n33\n00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.096\nSome terminology that we\nneed to be familiar with and\n\n34\n00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:44.138\njust some basic network and concepts that\nwithout, you can't secure a network,\n\n35\n00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:45.677\nyou cannot secure your nodes.\n\n36\n00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:48.635\nYou can't secure your enterprise\nif you don't understand\n\n37\n00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:50.180\nthe basic fundamentals of it.\n\n38\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.100\nYou can't communicate efficiently with\nother people when you're talking about\n\n39\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.420\nproblems or issues or\nideas if you don't have that terminology.\n\n40\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.230\nSo always important to start with\nthat foundational knowledge,\n\n41\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.190\nand we're gonna start with\nbasically network types, right?\n\n42\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.200\nWe need to be familiar when we’re talking\nabout our network, and somebody says,\n\n43\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.000\nwell, are you talking about your LAN?\n\n44\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.790\nOr are you talking about your WAN?\n\n45\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.990\nWhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n46\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.250\nSo those are some acronyms that I just\nthrew out at you, and let’s define them.\n\n47\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.782\nWe’re gonna start with LAN,\nL-A-N, or local area network.\n\n48\n00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:25.089\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\nI’ve got a little drawing that kinda\n\n49\n00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.420\nrepresents, or supposed to represent,\na local area network.\n\n50\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.140\nAnd Wes, I know when I define a local area\nnetwork, it's basically everything that's\n\n51\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.290\nin my little geographical region,\nlike my building here.\n\n52\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.900\nAnd you can see in this drawing\nI've got a router, some switches.\n\n53\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.752\nI got a client subnet over here.\n\n54\n00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:46.380\nI've got maybe a server backbone,\na wireless access point, wireless clients.\n\n55\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.750\nBut those are all here in this building.\n\n56\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.450\nThis building might be a single-floor,\nit might be multiple floors.\n\n57\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.710\nRight, but it's one geographic location.\n\n58\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.282\nRight, and that's typically how I\ndefine a local area network, right?\n\n59\n00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n60\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.020\nI think about that geographic location in\na privately owned, self-contained network.\n\n61\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.009\nAnd what I mean by that is both Mike and\nI,\n\n62\n00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.190\nwell, we have our own local area networks.\n\n63\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.495\nHe's got one at his house, and I've been\non it before, whether he knows it or not.\n\n64\n00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've got one at my house, but\n\n65\n00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.620\nthey're self contained, and\nthey are private entities.\n\n66\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.340\nWhich means he's gonna manage\nhis local area network,\n\n67\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.070\njust like I'm gonna manage mine.\n\n68\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.715\nIt doesn't have to be a home\nnetwork either, right?\n\n69\n00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.390\nThis could also,\nwhere we're going with this,\n\n70\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.810\nis that this could also be in\na business environment as well.\n\n71\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwe've got our local area network,\n\n72\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.650\neverything that's kinda, like you said,\nunder one management, all tied together.\n\n73\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.676\nAnd the big key here is using LAN\nprotocols, which we haven't come to yet.\n\n74\n00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.520\nWe're gonna talk about\nthose in just a minute.\n\n75\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.438\nBut there's a set of protocols that\nwe'll use on our local area network.\n\n76\n00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:50.060\nAll right, now your local area network\ncan take some different forms, right?\n\n77\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.769\nI've got this part back\nhere labeled intranet,\n\n78\n00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.160\nyou can see it's kinda behind a firewall.\n\n79\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.590\nThis is a very typical\nsmall business environment,\n\n80\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.950\nwe've got a firewall protecting\nyourself from the outside.\n\n81\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.360\nHelping me control that traffic that's\ncoming into my local area network.\n\n82\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.570\nCuz we're attached to the outside world,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.952\nVery few networks are not attached to\nthe world wide web, to the Internet.\n\n84\n00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.060\nSo I can get out there and\ngain access to other resources.\n\n85\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.040\nBut behind that firewall,\nthat's my local area network.\n\n86\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.020\nEverything back there is under one\nset of administrative control.\n\n87\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.960\nNow your local area network\nmight include some other parts.\n\n88\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.620\nYou might have a second firewall\nin between you and the Internet.\n\n89\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.650\nAnd between those firewalls, there's\na little space, I've got two, right?\n\n90\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.901\nI've got one back here, I've got one here,\n\n91\n00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.470\nthe Internet would be\nout here to the right.\n\n92\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.588\nSo as traffic comes in,\nit goes through this first firewall, and\n\n93\n00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:43.640\nit kind of gets to this intermediate area.\n\n94\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.858\nAnd then if allowed,\n\n95\n00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:49.230\nit might go through that second\nfirewall back to my corporate network.\n\n96\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.660\nAnd same thing for\ntraffic that's leaving my network.\n\n97\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.510\nThey're gonna go through that first\nfirewall, through this little area here,\n\n98\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.480\nand out through that second\nfirewall to the Internet.\n\n99\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.190\n&gt;&gt; And Mike,\n\n100\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060\nhelp me out here because you already\nhelped us with the one acronym there.\n\n101\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.460\nI see LAN, and\nit is defined as local area network.\n\n102\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.230\nI also see three sets of letters\nup there as well called a DMZ.\n\n103\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.340\nYou wanna help me out with that one?\n\n104\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.787\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea, I just type those out.\n\n105\n00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:16.590\nNo, a DMZ is the name I'm gonna give\nthat area between those two firewalls.\n\n106\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.910\nIt's known as a demilitarized zone.\n\n107\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.910\nIt has other names,\ndepending on who you're talking to or\n\n108\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.240\nwhat book you're reading.\n\n109\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.270\nYou might see it referenced as\na screened subnet, right, so\n\n110\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.600\na subnet between those two firewalls.\n\n111\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.900\nYou also might see it referenced\nas a perimeter network,\n\n112\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.790\nbecause it is on the perimeter\nof your network.\n\n113\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.000\nAnd just like a demilitarized zone\nin the physical world, right,\n\n114\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.380\nit's like a buffer space there.\n\n115\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.430\nThis is an area of my network that I'm\ngonna allow certain things to happen\n\n116\n00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.620\nthat I would not allow on my Internet,\nback here behind this second firewall.\n\n117\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.330\nFor example, I've got a website.\n\n118\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.250\nPeople come to my website to buy\nmy product, so I can make money.\n\n119\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.160\nSo I need to allow public,\nanonymous access to that website.\n\n120\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.130\nWell, I can't allow\npublic anonymous access\n\n121\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.330\nto my internal network on\nmy corporate LAN, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.100\nSo there,\nyou start to see some of the differences.\n\n123\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.660\nOn this front firewall, it's not\ngonna be configured quite as strict.\n\n124\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.510\nIt's gonna allow certain things through,\n\n125\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.430\nlike that public anonymous\naccess to that web front-end.\n\n126\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.890\nThis back firewall is gonna be\nconfigured a lot more stringent.\n\n127\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.140\nIt's not gonna allow that\nkind of thing through.\n\n128\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.330\nOnly certain machines or certain traffic\nis gonna be allowed to actually penetrate\n\n129\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.600\ninto the corporate network back here,\nthat private part, my intranet.\n\n130\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.960\nSo whatever you call it, DMZ,\nscreened subnet, perimeter network,\n\n131\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.320\nit acts as a little bit of buffer\nbetween you and the outside world.\n\n132\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.100\nIt's also where we put our\nresources that need public access.\n\n133\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.530\nOr another one you might see is\nwhat's called an extranet, right?\n\n134\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.280\nVery similar to what I've\ngot drawn here with the DMZ.\n\n135\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.770\nI might have a partner organization.\n\n136\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.340\nAnd maybe I'm a supplier of raw materials,\nand\n\n137\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.350\nthey're a manufacturer and\nthey need to purchase this stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.630\nAnd so I set up an area of my network\nwhere their employees can come in and\n\n139\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.880\nsee how much raw materials we have,\nplace orders, and look at ship dates and\n\n140\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.182\nthings like that.\n\n141\n00:07:14.182 --> 00:07:18.930\nI wanna provide that to them, but I don't\nwant that company's employees coming into\n\n142\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.950\nmy local area network back into\nmy intranet, don't need that.\n\n143\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.960\nSo I make it part of my network,\nnot quite publicly available.\n\n144\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920\nIt's like the screen subnet or a DMZ\nmight be available to anonymous access.\n\n145\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.560\nMy extranet is only available\nto Company XYZ from the outside.\n\n146\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.880\nOr I probably have several\npeople that I sell to.\n\n147\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.530\nSo my entire list of companies\nthat I provide raw materials to,\n\n148\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.820\nthey might have access to my extranet.\n\n149\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.321\nThe public's not allowed\ninto the extranet, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:56.471\nSo it's a part of my network that I can\nmake available to the outside basically.\n\n151\n00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.996\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now that local area network that\nyou've got in your diagram there, or\n\n152\n00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:03.865\nthe intranet as you've been talking about,\nI notice you got a few devices in there.\n\n153\n00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:08.441\nAnd does it matter whether I'm\na A small home environment.\n\n154\n00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:11.440\nWe're not talking business here or\na corporate environment.\n\n155\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.980\nLAN generally is not restricted,\n\n156\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.040\nor is it, to the amount of\ndevices you have on that network.\n\n157\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.800\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n158\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.010\nIt can be just a single node\nback there with no firewall.\n\n159\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.960\nMaybe you've got a router that you\npicked up from your cable provider or\n\n160\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.940\nyour Internet service provider and\nthen you plug straight into that.\n\n161\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.780\nHopefully not.\n\n162\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.690\nHopefully you know better than that.\n\n163\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.690\nBut then you've got at least some kind of\nrouter and or switch sitting back there.\n\n164\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.170\nBut absolutely,\na single node would still be an intranet.\n\n165\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.410\nIt would still be using LAN-based\nprotocols to communicate with, well,\n\n166\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.060\nnobody else.\n\n167\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.740\nBut let's say you added a second node,\nright?\n\n168\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.480\nAnd now your LAN is\na little more functional.\n\n169\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.000\nBut even with a single node you\nwould still be considered a LAN.\n\n170\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.800\nSo it's really all about the fact that\nit's under my administrative control and\n\n171\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.730\nthat it's geographically in one spot,\nI guess.\n\n172\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.750\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm watching this for the very\nfirst time, I don't have to worry about\n\n173\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.260\nbeing confused if this is a LAN because\nit has XYZ devices versus this is\n\n174\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.210\na LAN because it's got three floors and\nit's a corporate owned entity.\n\n175\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.610\nIt's just like you said,\ngeographical location and\n\n176\n00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.090\njust being under the administrative\ncontrol of or whoever runs the network.\n\n177\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n178\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.210\nAll right so now let's take a step up\nfrom LAN and we're gonna go to WAN.\n\n179\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.420\nSo LAN was local area network.\n\n180\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.850\nWe talk about a WAN,\nwe're talking about a wide area network.\n\n181\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.340\nAnd the names, if you start to pick up\non the names kind of gives you a hint,\n\n182\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.210\nright, wide area.\n\n183\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.280\nThat tells me it's probably gonna be\na little more geographically dispersed.\n\n184\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.410\nAnd so what I've got on my screen\nnow is our business has grown.\n\n185\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.480\nWe've got an office in New York.\n\n186\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.010\nWe've got another office in London.\n\n187\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.560\nAnd we've got another office in Sydney.\n\n188\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.310\nNow what you'll notice, or should notice\nhere I can get my mouse to play along.\n\n189\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.400\nIs, let's take just this New York for\na second.\n\n190\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.900\nNotice it looks very similar, right,\nto what we were just looking at for a LAN?\n\n191\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.310\nBecause I've basically copied and\npaste my drawing.\n\n192\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.310\nBecause it is, New York is a LAN,\nthat is a local area network there.\n\n193\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.540\nBut my organization has three of those.\n\n194\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.440\nHas one over here in London and\nanother one in Sydney.\n\n195\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.300\nAnd I apologize.\n\n196\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.110\nI hope I'm not making you sick there.\n\n197\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.360\nWe'll stop with the zooming around.\n\n198\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.220\nSo I've got basically\nthree local area networks.\n\n199\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.670\nOne in London, one in New York,\nAnd one in Sydney.\n\n200\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.360\nNow I need to tie these guys together,\nbecause people in London need to access\n\n201\n00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.620\nresources in New York and\nSydney and vise versa.\n\n202\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.630\nSo when we start bringing\nthese office together,\n\n203\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:44.230\nstart connecting them, now we're talking\nabout our wide area network, all right?\n\n204\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.185\nWide area networks or\nWANs travel across or\n\n205\n00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:54.160\ndesigned to connect geographically\ndispersed locations, all right.\n\n206\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160\nThey do use a different set of protocols\nwhich will come too here in just a minute.\n\n207\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.448\nI wanna make sure we get\nthe concept down first.\n\n208\n00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo wide area network is really\nnothing more than an collection of\n\n209\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.970\nlocal area networks kinda connected\ntogether cuz we have enterprise admins.\n\n210\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.630\nSo New York is under my control.\n\n211\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.460\nLondon is also under my control.\n\n212\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.410\nSydney is also under my control.\n\n213\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.500\nAnd by our definition of LAN,\nwe said if it was a network under a single\n\n214\n00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.010\nadministrative control,\nit should be a LAN.\n\n215\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.750\nIt was the second part of that LAN\ndefinition that's getting us, right?\n\n216\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.740\nIt's not in a geographic or\nsingle geographic location.\n\n217\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.920\nNow we're talking about\nthree different locations.\n\n218\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.610\nSo still under one administrative control\nbut now I'm geographically dispersed.\n\n219\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.160\nNow were talking about\nthe wide area network.\n\n220\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.964\nAnd we do have to be a little bit\ncareful with this because really when\n\n221\n00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:42.903\nwe talk about the wide area network,\nwe're talking about this part,\n\n222\n00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:45.440\nthe stuff that's in\nfront of this firewall,\n\n223\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.229\nits all of the things that are connecting\nthese three local area networks together.\n\n224\n00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:55.500\nThis is still my LAN back here,\nthis is another LAN, this is another LAN.\n\n225\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.850\nIt's a separate set of technologies\nthat's connecting those LANs and\n\n226\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.220\ncreating my WAN, or my wide area network.\n\n227\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.880\nWe have separate administrators and\nin a larger environment,\n\n228\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.570\nI know a lot of us are in the smaller\nshops and we wear all the hats.\n\n229\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.020\nBut in some organizations,\n\n230\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.850\nyou have LAN administrators that deal with\nLAN protocols and LAN troubleshooting.\n\n231\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.460\nYou also have WAN administrators that\ndeal with the WAN side of things.\n\n232\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.610\nAnd when they're troubleshooting,\nthey look at this demarcation point here,\n\n233\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.630\nthis firewall, and that's how they decide.\n\n234\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.520\nIf it's on one side of the firewall,\nhey LAN admins, it's your problem,\n\n235\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.160\nyou deal with it.\n\n236\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.970\nIf it's on the other side of the firewall,\nhey WAN admins,\n\n237\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.730\nit's your problem,\nyou deal with it, right?\n\n238\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.650\nSo the WAN is that wide area network\nthat's tieing those local area\n\n239\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.640\nnetworks together.\n\n240\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.720\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned the connections.\n\n241\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.800\nSo, Mike, when you say that, hey, it's\non your side, you take care of it, hey,\n\n242\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.530\nit's on your side, you take care of it,\n\n243\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.490\nyou're not really necessarily talking\nabout just the point of responsibility.\n\n244\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.530\nBut you've already mentioned that these\ncommunication types are completely\n\n245\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.120\ndifferent, so one set of\ncommunication protocols is gonna be\n\n246\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.740\nhandled by one set of administrators\nversus somebody else.\n\n247\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.410\nI did have another question,\nbecause you and I both have LANs, right?\n\n248\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n249\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.500\nWhy is, would that be considered a WAN?\n\n250\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.200\nOr would that not be considered a WAN?\n\n251\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.360\nYou have your home network,\nI have my home network.\n\n252\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Well we won't tell him, but\nwhen his network's under my control,\n\n253\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.445\nwhich is after midnight typically,\nthen it's a WAN.\n\n254\n00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:14.090\n[LAUGH] Very good question.\n\n255\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.650\nAnd no,\n\n256\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.830\nit's not a WAN because it's not under\nthe same administrative control, right.\n\n257\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.020\nYou could consider Wes and\nI, separate organizations.\n\n258\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.570\nWe both have LANs and\n\n259\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.010\nwe're both tied to the same Internet but\nwe're not sharing resources.\n\n260\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.520\nWe're not under the same\nadministrative control so\n\n261\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.090\nwe would not be considered a WAN.\n\n262\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.780\nWe are going across a WAN because\nreally the Internet is a WAN, right?\n\n263\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.990\nBut that wouldn't in itself\nwould be considered a WAN.\n\n264\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.960\nGreat question.\n\n265\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.910\nNow there's some others that I didn't draw\nup that we should probably be familiar\n\n266\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.970\nwith just in case they ask us.\n\n267\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.620\nAnd so we can sound intelligent if\nsomebody else uses these crazy terms.\n\n268\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.200\nI think people just sit up at night and\n\n269\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.670\ndream of ways to expand\nthese acronym bases.\n\n270\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.700\nBut there's something called\na MAN a metropolitan area network\n\n271\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.070\na WAN covers a wide geographical space.\n\n272\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.430\nWhat if I took this offices,\nlet's say this was in New York, but\n\n273\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.940\nthis was actually East New York and\n\n274\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.600\nthis was West New York and\nthis was South New York, all right?\n\n275\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.730\nAnd said of being New York,\nSydney, and London.\n\n276\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.330\nAll right?\n\n277\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.520\nIf they're all three local area networks,\nthree different buildings, three different\n\n278\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.910\ngeographical locations tied together\nwith WAN technologies, but in the same\n\n279\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:32.450\nmetropolitan area, it would be considered\na MAN, a metropolitan area network.\n\n280\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.620\nNow If we get that specific or not,\nI don't think it's all that big of a deal.\n\n281\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.520\nBut it's still using WAN technologies.\n\n282\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.170\nIt's just that we can define the\ngeographic distribution a little better.\n\n283\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.330\nWe can say it's all contained\nwithin this one metropolitan area.\n\n284\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.790\nBut it's still WAN technology.\n\n285\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.690\nSo really a MAN is just a subset of a WAN.\n\n286\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.860\nIt's a different classification\nof a WAN or wide area network.\n\n287\n00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.210\nSame thing we're talking about a CAN or\na campus area network.\n\n288\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.170\nIf I own a lot of property\nlike a university.\n\n289\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.360\nI might have separate LANs at\neach one of my buildings, right?\n\n290\n00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.590\nFood Science building has its own LAN.\n\n291\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.630\nI'm trying to think of some of the others.\n\n292\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.620\nI didn't go to college, no.\n\n293\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.560\nSome of the others,\nyou got Financing over in one building.\n\n294\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.420\nEach one of those can be different LANs.\n\n295\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.650\nTie those together using WAN technologies,\nand now I've got a campus area network.\n\n296\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.680\nAnd really that's why we differentiate.\n\n297\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.780\nWell, because in a metropolitan area\nnetwork, if I'm connecting LANs.\n\n298\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.020\nDifferent buildings in\na metropolitan area,\n\n299\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.130\nI most likely don't own the links between\nthe two buildings in that downtown area.\n\n300\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.465\nOr between downtown east and\ndowntown downtown west.\n\n301\n00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:43.815\nI can't just go and get a ditch digger and\ncut a cable or cut a trench and\n\n302\n00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:48.616\nrun a line between my two buildings,\nright, I've got to go and rent lines or\n\n303\n00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:52.765\nlease lines from somebody with\nthat metropolitan area network.\n\n304\n00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:58.167\nIf it's a university campus or a large\nindustrial park and I own all the land\n\n305\n00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:02.995\nI can now dig a tunnel and not a tunnel\nbut trench and lay down cable.\n\n306\n00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:07.388\nAnd even though I'm using WAN technologies\nto connect those two buildings It's under\n\n307\n00:16:07.388 --> 00:16:08.057\nmy control.\n\n308\n00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:12.278\nSo that's where we would say it's a campus\narea network not a metropolitan area\n\n309\n00:16:12.278 --> 00:16:13.750\nnetwork, all right.\n\n310\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.050\nEven though technically I guess your\ncampus could be a little more dispersed\n\n311\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.980\nthan a metropolitan.\n\n312\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.919\nSo it's really about who owns the lines\nthat are linking those lands at\n\n313\n00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:22.669\nthat point.\n\n314\n00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:23.880\nAnd then there's another one.\n\n315\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.730\nI know, Wes,\nyou're familiar with this one.\n\n316\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.680\nThe whole PAN,\nyou know what that one stands for?\n\n317\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n318\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.933\nThat is a little young kid that\nflies around with pixie dust.\n\n319\n00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:33.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, guys.\n\n320\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.390\nPAN, personal area network.\n\n321\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.359\nAnd I believe we do see this in the realm\nof things like Bluetooth communications,\n\n322\n00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.530\nthat's one that comes to mind?\n\n323\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, right?\n\n324\n00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:44.660\nA lot of us have these now, even though\nwe've probably never heard that term.\n\n325\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.450\nBut a personal area network\nwould be your phone,\n\n326\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.309\ntalking to your headset,\ntalking to your watch,\n\n327\n00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:54.480\nthat also talks to your sneakers to\nkeep track of how far you've walked.\n\n328\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.815\nAll of that is networked together\nusing a radio frequency, Bluetooth,\n\n329\n00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:02.166\nshort wave radio,\nto network those devices together.\n\n330\n00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.150\nAnd they don't communicate.\n\n331\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.023\nWell hopefully if we keep things secure,\n\n332\n00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:08.083\nthey're not communicating with\nWes's phone or Wes's sneakers.\n\n333\n00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:11.383\nRight, that's my own\npersonal area network.\n\n334\n00:17:11.383 --> 00:17:13.704\n&gt;&gt; I've gotta love it when you say my\nsneakers have a network connection.\n\n335\n00:17:13.704 --> 00:17:14.910\nThat's interesting.\n\n336\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.582\nNow I see where you've gone\nhere with the land technology,\n\n337\n00:17:18.582 --> 00:17:20.645\nsingle geographical location.\n\n338\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:24.624\nThe WAN technology multiple\ngeographical locations.\n\n339\n00:17:24.624 --> 00:17:29.304\nMAN, maybe a whole entire\ncity campus owned by a single\n\n340\n00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:32.410\nacademic entity, if you will.\n\n341\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.738\nLet me guess, pan.\n\n342\n00:17:33.738 --> 00:17:36.287\nIts gonna be your personal\ngeographical location.\n\n343\n00:17:36.287 --> 00:17:40.325\n&gt;&gt; That's right, wherever you are,\nIts the network that you take with you.\n\n344\n00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.477\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some of our pan's are larger than\n\n345\n00:17:42.477 --> 00:17:45.170\nothers, I say, you just have to\nlook at my gut and you can tell.\n\n346\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.357\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I was gonna say,\n\n347\n00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:51.102\nbeing six something there six, two,\nhe's got a different frequency that he\n\n348\n00:17:51.102 --> 00:17:53.531\nuses to get from his tennis\nshoes up to his earbud.\n\n349\n00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit longer, so.\n\n350\n00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.203\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n351\n00:17:56.203 --> 00:17:59.475\nthose are some of the network types\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n352\n00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:01.804\nAgain, make yourself flash cards,\ndo what you gotta do.\n\n353\n00:18:01.804 --> 00:18:06.786\nFor LAN, WAN, CAN, MAN, and PAN are the\nfive acronyms that I want you to be\n\n354\n00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:11.140\nfamiliar with as you're preparing for\nthis exam.\n\n355\n00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.510\nAnd just in general.\n\n356\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.970\nAll right, next thing we want to talk\nabout Wes is gonna be network topologies.\n\n357\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.210\nSo within that network,\n\n358\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:24.710\nwe're going to define how these devices,\nlet's get back over to LAN here.\n\n359\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.810\nHow are these devices connected?\n\n360\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.470\nHow they're laid out that's what\nwe call our network topology.\n\n361\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.060\nAnd those are some important\ndecisions that we've gotta make\n\n362\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.010\nif we're setting up a network.\n\n363\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.780\nIt's also important to understand what\nwe're currently using when it's time to\n\n364\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.440\ntroubleshoot.\n\n365\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.020\nWhen we're trying to\nfigure out what is wrong.\n\n366\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.120\nOr when we're trying to\nprotect that network.\n\n367\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.380\nWe need to know that topology.\n\n368\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:53.570\nHow those packets are being transmitted\nback and forth between these devices.\n\n369\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.970\nWhat interconnectivity devices are there.\n\n370\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.030\nWhat they're allowing, what they're\nnot allowing, and things like that.\n\n371\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.476\nSo let's take a look.\n\n372\n00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:04.456\nI have another handy dandy drawing.\n\n373\n00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:06.469\nAnd we don't wanna save any of those.\n\n374\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.560\nFor our topologies.\n\n375\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.440\nAnd this first one, Wes,\nwhat do you call that one?\n\n376\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.620\n&gt;&gt; That one looks like,\n\n377\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.440\nwith the linear format, I'm gonna say\nthat's probably what's known as a bus.\n\n378\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.210\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, sir,\nyou get a gold star for the day.\n\n379\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.190\nThat's gonna be what\nwe call a bus network.\n\n380\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.670\nAnd this is one of the oldest forms, or\n\n381\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.660\none of the oldest topologies we\nhave when it comes to networking.\n\n382\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.950\nWas it ThickNet, I guess, was using, was\na big one with this way back in the day?\n\n383\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.280\nBack when I first started getting\ninto computers and networks.\n\n384\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.360\nWe use something called Thicknet\nthat ran behind the desk.\n\n385\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.629\nSomething we're probably don't\nneed to worry about nowadays.\n\n386\n00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:48.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, unless you're in a museum,\n\n387\n00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:51.886\nI highly doubt you're gonna see anything\non the old Thinnet and Thicknet, for sure.\n\n388\n00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:57.300\nAnd Mike, now, I'm pretty familiar with\nthe fact that these had some problems.\n\n389\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.720\nIn the terms of scalability,\nwere these type of networks scalable to,\n\n390\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.460\nsay if I had a massively\nlarge organization?\n\n391\n00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, it kinda depends on what\nwe're talking about I guess.\n\n392\n00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.274\nLet's talk about some of\nthe good things about this bus,\n\n393\n00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.506\nand we'll see how it scales up, right?\n\n394\n00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:16.040\nOne nice thing about a bus network like\nthis is you have less cables, right?\n\n395\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.380\nI take this one long cable here,\nand I can run\n\n396\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.972\nit around through each one of the offices,\nbehind a row cubicles, or whatever.\n\n397\n00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:27.760\nAnd then when I add a node, I simply\ntake a short cable, run it from the node\n\n398\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.118\nto that cable that's already laying,\nprobably right behind my cubicle there.\n\n399\n00:20:31.118 --> 00:20:33.930\nI just tap it down,\nmaybe old vampire tabs or\n\n400\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.840\na T connector of some kind,\nto connect those together so.\n\n401\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.560\nIn one respect it was kinda nice because\nI had fewer cables to deal with,\n\n402\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.000\nbut the downside of the bus technology or\n\n403\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.260\nthe bus topology I should say,\nis a couple of things.\n\n404\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.290\nOne, they're all connected.\n\n405\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.800\nSo, if we ever have a break in the cable,\n\n406\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.171\nnow let's see if I can draw a break,\nlet's say I break it right here.\n\n407\n00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:03.685\nThat's not very good.\n\n408\n00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:07.250\nLet's make it a little bit bigger so\nwe can see this guy.\n\n409\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:14.310\nLet's say we grab a, kinda like that, and\nwe get a break in the cable there right?\n\n410\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.604\nWes, what's gonna happen to all\nthe communication between these devices?\n\n411\n00:21:18.604 --> 00:21:22.841\n&gt;&gt; I want to say one cable, one break,\nmeans the whole entire network disappears,\n\n412\n00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:24.035\ncommunication wise.\n\n413\n00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n414\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.890\nIf that cable breaks,\neverybody loses communication.\n\n415\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.108\nNow, think about this.\n\n416\n00:21:30.108 --> 00:21:33.630\nWes was saying,\ndoes this scale up to a large network?\n\n417\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.230\nSure, I can take that cable and\n\n418\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.600\nI can run it around behind\neverybody's desk in the building.\n\n419\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.010\nAnd there are some limitations\nto the distance we can go.\n\n420\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.148\nBut let's say theoretically, that we run\nthis cable behind every little office in\n\n421\n00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:48.174\nour entire building and\neverybody's patched down to that.\n\n422\n00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:50.077\nOne little cable break,\n\n423\n00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:54.981\nsomebody rolls over that with\na heavy cart or cable gets kinked.\n\n424\n00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.740\nNow, everybody in the entire\nbuilding has lost communication.\n\n425\n00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.460\nThe entire network is down, right?\n\n426\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.980\nThat was a big problem\nwith these bus networks,\n\n427\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.620\nas I get rid of our little stripe.\n\n428\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.626\nThe other issue that we had run into,\nor we had to deal with,\n\n429\n00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:13.504\nwas these guys needed terminators.\n\n430\n00:22:13.504 --> 00:22:17.443\nWhen we dealt with buses we had to\nterminate the ends now this would actually\n\n431\n00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:19.644\nplug in to something in my server closet.\n\n432\n00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:23.800\nBut we had to make sure we terminated\nthe ends because we would give what was\n\n433\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.956\ncalled, what is the technical term?\n\n434\n00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Signal reflection.\n\n435\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.010\n&gt;&gt; Signal reflection, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.290\nWhen if I speak,\n\n437\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.640\nlet's say this computer sends out some\ndata, that travels both directions.\n\n438\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.250\nDown this line, everybody hears it.\n\n439\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.350\nIf it gets to here and\nthere's no terminator, well it gets\n\n440\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.380\nto the end of this raw line, the signal\nactually starts coming back, and imagine\n\n441\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.650\nyou ever drop something you take a bucket\nof water and you drop something in there.\n\n442\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.120\nYou got these nice neat\nripples going out but\n\n443\n00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200\nas soon as those ripples hit the wall of\nthe bucket, they start reflecting back in.\n\n444\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.330\nNow I've got some ripples\nstill making their way out.\n\n445\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.141\nI've got some ripples coming back in,\nand the ripples start crossing and\n\n446\n00:23:03.141 --> 00:23:05.365\nit gets kinda this weird pattern on there.\n\n447\n00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:07.770\nIt's the exact same thing\nthat's gonna happen here.\n\n448\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.681\nThe problem with our communications,\nwith electronic communications is,\n\n449\n00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:15.713\nthose crossing of the ripples like that\nIt's basically scrambling the data and\n\n450\n00:23:15.713 --> 00:23:18.861\nI'm not going to be able to make\nsense out of what's going on.\n\n451\n00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:23.810\nI'll lose that, what's a good word for\nit, you just can't interpret it.\n\n452\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.630\nSo you can't read the data.\n\n453\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.620\nSo basically nobody can communicate again.\n\n454\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.890\n&gt;&gt; You know I make the joke here that\nyou're probably only going to see them in\n\n455\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.318\na museum, but I was watching some of\nthe earlier days when this was the network\n\n456\n00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:35.819\ntechnology on some kind of show.\n\n457\n00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:39.786\nAnd one of the earlier inventors,\ninventors of this product said, you can\n\n458\n00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:43.421\nalways tell when somebody wanted a break\ncuz all they have to do is reach down and\n\n459\n00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.484\npull one of those\nterminators off the line.\n\n460\n00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:49.389\nAnd then everybody's faces would slowly\ncome up from their cubes wondering why's\n\n461\n00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:50.310\nthe network down.\n\n462\n00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.993\nSo I can see this would be a fun time at\nthe office when this network didn't work.\n\n463\n00:23:53.993 --> 00:23:55.232\n&gt;&gt; And the scary thing was Wes,\n\n464\n00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:57.977\nwhat if I broke this cable here\ndoes that bother my network too?\n\n465\n00:23:57.977 --> 00:23:59.926\n&gt;&gt; It brings the whole network\nto still a single cable.\n\n466\n00:23:59.926 --> 00:24:02.292\n&gt;&gt; That's right cuz this\nwhole thing you can imagine,\n\n467\n00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:04.622\nis the signal going out\nacross all of these cables.\n\n468\n00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:07.931\nSo It's not just a break in the main line.\n\n469\n00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:12.248\nIf Wes wanted that break, [LAUGH]\nliterally, and breaks the cable there,\n\n470\n00:24:12.248 --> 00:24:13.860\nyeah, everybody is down.\n\n471\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.070\nSo buses had their place in history.\n\n472\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.180\nYou don't see them that often anymore.\n\n473\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.820\nLet's move onto a little more modern\nlayout, a little modern topology.\n\n474\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.990\nAnd that's gonna be our star.\n\n475\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.920\nAnd you can see,\n\n476\n00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.990\nit gets the name from the pattern that it\nmakes when we kinda draw it out like this.\n\n477\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.640\nBut the big difference between a bus and\n\n478\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.180\na star is I now have a central\nconnectivity device.\n\n479\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.430\nI have something tying all\nof these things together.\n\n480\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.650\nSo instead of there\nbeing that backbone and\n\n481\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.690\neverybody T-ing into\nthis backbone down here.\n\n482\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:53.392\nWe've got this one device in the middle,\nand everything plugs into that one device.\n\n483\n00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:56.287\nAnd this is what we would\ncall a star topology.\n\n484\n00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:59.047\nNow that device in\nthe middle could be a hub,\n\n485\n00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:01.965\ncould be a switch,\ncould be a bridge, right?\n\n486\n00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:05.170\nWe'll talk about these\ndevices as we go along.\n\n487\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.540\nAdvantages to this layout, well, is\ngoing to be the fact that, what happens,\n\n488\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.440\nWes, if this cable breaks here?\n\n489\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, with a connectivity device,\nI think it isolates just that one\n\n490\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.330\nnode that's connected to the device\nfrom the rest of the network.\n\n491\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.360\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n492\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.250\nSo that one node would be down.\n\n493\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.180\nNobody could communicate with this node.\n\n494\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.060\nThis node could communicate with\nnobody else, but that's it.\n\n495\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.440\nThe other three nodes on this network\nare still communicating just fine.\n\n496\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.260\nSo it ends up creating this point-to-point\nconnection between the node and\n\n497\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.070\nthat central connectivity device.\n\n498\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.240\nWhich eliminates my need for\none, for terminators.\n\n499\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.910\nAnd two, the single cable break\nbrings down the entire network.\n\n500\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:42.610\nFlexibility.\n\n501\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.350\nWhen I need to plug in a new node, as long\nas there's an extra port on this guy,\n\n502\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.180\nI can just pop a new node out here.\n\n503\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.180\nAnd connect it up, and\nwe're good to go, all right?\n\n504\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.428\nDownside is to connect that node,\nI had to make a home run.\n\n505\n00:25:56.428 --> 00:25:58.850\nAnd I'm not talking about hitting\nit out of the park, right?\n\n506\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.200\nI've gotta run a wire from that person's\noffice, that new computer he just got,\n\n507\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.820\nup the wall, over the attic, down in.\n\n508\n00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.410\nWherever that central\nconnectivity device is,\n\n509\n00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.310\nI've gotta connect that\nmachine to it somehow, right?\n\n510\n00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.950\nSo a lot more cable involved when we\ndeal with setting up star topologies.\n\n511\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.009\n&gt;&gt; Now it's interesting, and\nI think you did this on purpose here.\n\n512\n00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:21.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now you showed us the first one which\n\n513\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.179\nwas probably one that we will\nnever really see anymore.\n\n514\n00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:25.690\nBecause it's just not utilize anymore.\n\n515\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.587\nNow this almost is the polar reverse.\n\n516\n00:26:27.587 --> 00:26:30.733\nHow common is this type of\nnetwork in today's day and age?\n\n517\n00:26:30.733 --> 00:26:32.010\n&gt;&gt; This is just about everywhere.\n\n518\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.862\nJust about every network you\nrun into is gonna be switched,\n\n519\n00:26:34.862 --> 00:26:36.905\nwhat they call switched Ethernet.\n\n520\n00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:41.369\nMeaning that we're running star topologies\nwith a central connectivity device.\n\n521\n00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:42.885\nAlmost always a switch.\n\n522\n00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:46.455\nHubs, which we're gonna talk about later,\nyou rarely see those anymore.\n\n523\n00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:49.970\nBridges you really don't see\nthose much anymore except for\n\n524\n00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.802\nin special needs situations.\n\n525\n00:26:51.802 --> 00:26:56.752\nBut to Wes's point, yeah, just about every\nsingle network is gonna be laid out in\n\n526\n00:26:56.752 --> 00:27:00.000\na star using a central\nconnectivity device.\n\n527\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.760\nWell, Mike,\nI know we got a lot more to go.\n\n528\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.610\nYou guys out there that are sharp probably\nseen that we've got a lot more of those\n\n529\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.580\ndiagrams there.\n\n530\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.760\nYou can see all the little tabs.\n\n531\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.750\nBut I'll tell you what we\ndon't have time for right now.\n\n532\n00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.920\nAnd that's the time on that clock.\n\n533\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.567\nSo Mike, were you gonna go ahead and\nwrap this up?\n\n534\n00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.670\nAnd come back in a part two, and\n\n535\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.650\nwe'll continue along in\nour network fundamentals?\n\n536\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.570\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n537\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good, well,\nthat's a perfect place to stop.\n\n538\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.320\nThank you, Mike, for being here.\n\n539\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.832\nWe'll see you guys, hopefully,\nsee you in the next episode.\n\n540\n00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:28.895\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI have been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n541\n00:27:28.895 --> 00:27:29.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n542\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.908\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n543\n00:27:30.908 -->

00:00:11.791\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.110\nwe are continuing through our\nGIAC security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.780\nThat's right, Mike.\n\n8\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.619\nI said it right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.827\nGSAC here.\n\n10\n00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:26.883\nWe're coming back at you with a part\ntwo in networking fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:29.550\nAnd, who better to help us\nout here than Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.420\nHow you doing, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.530\nAnd yeah, we left off talking\nabout number topologies.\n\n15\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.390\nAnd we're just gonna\ndive right back in and\n\n16\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.930\ncontinue our discussion\non number topologies.\n\n17\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.050\nSo let's jump right back on my screen,\nand pick up where we left off.\n\n18\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.000\nWe began our discussion on star,\nthat star topology.\n\n19\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.467\nWe've got that on my screen here.\n\n20\n00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:54.543\nYou can see every device connects back\nto that central connectivity device.\n\n21\n00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.405\nTalk about having to add a new node.\n\n22\n00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.912\nWe gotta run extra cable to\nconnect that node back to\n\n23\n00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:01.020\nthat central connectivity device.\n\n24\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.130\nWe also talked about the upsides of\nour star is going to be the fact that\n\n25\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.820\nevery node has a point-to-point connection\nback to that central connectivity device.\n\n26\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.150\nSo we cut a cable,\nthe entire network doesn't go down, right,\n\n27\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.900\njust that one node goes down.\n\n28\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.090\nThere is a downside though.\n\n29\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.910\nThere is a single point of failure\nin a star topology, isn't there Wes?\n\n30\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.660\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, I gotta say, looking at\nthis diagram it's probably gonna be that\n\n31\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.630\ncentral connectivity device that all\nthe other devices are connected.\n\n32\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.700\nI can only imagine that if we lose that,\n\n33\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.510\nwell nobody on the network's\ngonna communicate, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.560\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n35\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.410\nWe take that thing down and\neverybody loses connectivity.\n\n36\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.158\nSo you do end up with a single point\nof failure when you're setting up\n\n37\n00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:42.921\na basic switch ethernet or\nusing that star topology.\n\n38\n00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:46.119\nSo it is something that you're\ngonna have to be cautious about.\n\n39\n00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.767\nWhen you think about\nyou're creating networks,\n\n40\n00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.928\nkeep in mind that they can become\na single point of failure.\n\n41\n00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.295\nNow another type of network topology\nthat we need to be familiar with,\n\n42\n00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:56.672\nis something called a mesh.\n\n43\n00:01:56.672 --> 00:01:58.966\nNow start with what's\nknown as a partial mesh.\n\n44\n00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:03.552\nAnd in a partial mesh, what they mean is\nthat our nodes are connected to more than\n\n45\n00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.500\none other node, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.563\nExample, in this partial mesh,\n\n47\n00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:11.776\neach one of these nodes is connected\nto two partners instead of one.\n\n48\n00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:15.660\nAnd the idea is that it provides\na little bit of redundancy, right?\n\n49\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.385\nIf I lose this cable, I can't go this\nway to communicate over to here,\n\n50\n00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:26.237\nbut I could go around the long way and\nstill communicate, so\n\n51\n00:02:26.237 --> 00:02:30.235\nI didn't lose complete\ncontact with that node.\n\n52\n00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:34.115\nAnd again, this is what I call a partial\nmesh cuz it's not a full mesh.\n\n53\n00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:35.590\nI'll come to that here in just a second.\n\n54\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.380\nI will tell you that\nthis is not very common.\n\n55\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.580\nYou're not gonna see this in just\nabout any corporate environment,\n\n56\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.510\nLAN environment,\nmeshes are not gonna be all that common.\n\n57\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.163\nAnd it's really cuz of\nthe complexity of setting it up,\n\n58\n00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:49.583\nand the amount of equipment.\n\n59\n00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:53.730\nIn this one here each one of these\nnodes has to have two network adapters.\n\n60\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.780\nEach one of these nodes has two\ncables running out of the back of it,\n\n61\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.000\nback to wherever to connect\nto these other nodes.\n\n62\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.440\nSo it's not very common.\n\n63\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.550\nIf we take that from a partial to full\nyou'll really start to see why we don't\n\n64\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.550\nuse these typically in\na corporate environment.\n\n65\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.162\nHere's five nodes, all right,\nand this is a full mesh,\n\n66\n00:03:12.162 --> 00:03:16.017\nnow every node is connected to\nevery other node, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:20.181\nSo you can see that each node has four\nconnections coming out of it because\n\n68\n00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:23.525\nthere's five nodes,\nI'm already connected to myself,\n\n69\n00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:28.340\nI don't need a connection for that so\nif there's five nodes I'm one of them.\n\n70\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.420\nI need four connections to\nconnect everybody else.\n\n71\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.203\nThere's a little formula you can use.\n\n72\n00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:38.402\nIs n * (n-1)/2, so\nI got 5 * (5-1) which is 4,\n\n73\n00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:43.992\ndivided by 2, 5 * 4 is 20,\ndivided by 2 is 10,\n\n74\n00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:50.940\nthat is 10 connections that I'm\ndealing with there, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.600\nAnd where was I going with that?\n\n76\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.370\nSo yeah,\nthe complexity is just ridiculous.\n\n77\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.460\nI mean one,\n\n78\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.690\nwhen's the last time you saw a client with\nfour network adapters in it, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.350\nWhat if I add a client?\n\n80\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.890\nNow all of a sudden,\n\n81\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.080\nI've gotta add another network adapter\nto every single machine on my network,\n\n82\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.446\nrun a new cable from every single machine\non my network, back to that new node,\n\n83\n00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:13.530\nprobably not gonna happen.\n\n84\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike.\n\n85\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.940\nThe only time I've actually seen\na full mesh, come to think about it,\n\n86\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.470\nwas in wireless laptop communications\nwhere we didn't have an accent.\n\n87\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.550\nWe didn't have the central connectivity\ndevice that you showed us in the star, so\n\n88\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.890\nwe just put the network adapters in a kind\nof a mode where they could all talk to\n\n89\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.580\neach other, and that's really\nthe only place I've ever seen it.\n\n90\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the only other place you'll see\na full mesh is on your WAN side of things.\n\n91\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.767\nHere, it is a little more common to do\na full mesh, all right, because one,\n\n92\n00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:42.900\nI'm typically leasing lines and\nthey're already there.\n\n93\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.330\nI can just say hey, I need\na connection from Seattle to Chicago.\n\n94\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.520\nI need a connection from Chicago to\nBoston, and I need one from Boston.\n\n95\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.830\nAnd you get the idea.\n\n96\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.220\nSo here where you can see each one of\nthese might be a different geographical,\n\n97\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.450\none of my offices in different towns,\neach office is connected to each other\n\n98\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.070\noffice so that if I lose this connection\nhere, well they could still go\n\n99\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.310\naround the bend and communicate\nif they absolutely had to, right?\n\n100\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.290\nI can have it set up to where it\nfalls back to that other route,\n\n101\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.520\nmake that other route little more costly\ncuz it's gotta go further along but\n\n102\n00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.970\nat least they've got a backup path\nto get to that other location.\n\n103\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.320\nSo a cable cut,\na loss of connectivity from one ISP,\n\n104\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.470\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nmy whole office is down.\n\n105\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.290\n&gt;&gt; So when you talked about\nadministration and complexity,\n\n106\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.630\nso if I understand it right, a full mesh,\n\n107\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.290\nyou're talking about an exponential\nincrease if I just add one node.\n\n108\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.280\nSo cost and\nmaintenance goes through the roof.\n\n109\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.720\nBut the benefit seems to be as more of\na resiliency to failure, like in the WAN\n\n110\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.620\nenvironment where you're saying, where\none connection to one site goes down,\n\n111\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.640\nI still have connection whether it's\nthrough a completely different provider,\n\n112\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.760\nbut at least I have options.\n\n113\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.800\nThere so, resiliency.\n\n114\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n115\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.430\nResiliency is the key.\n\n116\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.300\nWe see that, actually,\nthe Internet is a really good example.\n\n117\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.130\nIt might not be a full, complete,\n100% mesh, but it's definitely a mesh.\n\n118\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.615\nWhen my packets leave my computer and\nthey're going out to some website,\n\n119\n00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:09.730\nABC.com, they don't all\nnecessarily go the same route.\n\n120\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.420\nThey take the best route\nthat they can at the time.\n\n121\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.310\nThe route that the first packet\ntook might not be the best route\n\n122\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.380\nwhen the second packet leaves.\n\n123\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.052\nIt might decide that this is gonna\nbe a faster route, right, and\n\n124\n00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:24.540\nbecause the way the Internet is layed out,\nit's kinda like a big spiderweb and\n\n125\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.225\nthere's many, many routes you can go,\nso it is a mesh of sorts.\n\n126\n00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:32.623\nAll right, so we dug in terminology-wise,\nmesh network, when you start connecting\n\n127\n00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:35.832\nall the nodes, all the other nodes,\nyou can do a partial mesh.\n\n128\n00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.589\nNone of these are gonna be very\ncommon inside a LAN unless its\n\n129\n00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:44.100\nsome critical security controls,\nor I might see that, yeah, again,\n\n130\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.370\nI'm trying to think of something.\n\n131\n00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.380\nI've never seen one inside a LAN.\n\n132\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.120\nUsually, you're gonna see this\non the WAN side of things.\n\n133\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.410\nOther topologies that we might deal with\nare gonna be ring topologies, right?\n\n134\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.420\nA ring, you can see why it gets its\nname from the drawing here, vvery\n\n135\n00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.930\nnode is connected to what we would call an\nupstream partner and a downstream partner.\n\n136\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.825\nAnd then the traffic\nflows around that ring.\n\n137\n00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:12.730\nA token ring is a really good\nexample of a ring topology,\n\n138\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.020\nanother one that we don't\nsee as often anymore.\n\n139\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.630\nDo we, Wes?\n\n140\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n141\n00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.310\nI think I know where\nyou're going with this.\n\n142\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.200\nIs that the old?\n\n143\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.454\nAnd I just love to say this,\nFDDI, we're talking about?\n\n144\n00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:25.706\nSorry, guys, for the acronym soup.\n\n145\n00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:26.850\nIt's geek humor here.\n\n146\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.440\nBut the fiber distributed data interface,\nI believe is what it was called.\n\n147\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah good old FDDI.\n\n148\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.710\nThe rings, they kinda make sense,\nyou've got a little bit, well it depends.\n\n149\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.420\nYou really gotta be careful with this one.\n\n150\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.060\nThis ring set up as it is,\nif I lose this connection right here,\n\n151\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.793\neverybody's down, right?\n\n152\n00:07:43.793 --> 00:07:46.920\nIt shares a lot in terms\nof the bus topology.\n\n153\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.985\nIf you took a bus and just folded it over\non itself, took off the terminators and\n\n154\n00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:54.000\nconnect the ends, you now have a ring.\n\n155\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.893\nEverybody is tied into that one cable\nthat's running around this ring.\n\n156\n00:07:58.893 --> 00:08:02.076\nSo if I break that ring\nwe lose connectivity.\n\n157\n00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:06.761\nNow you start getting into some of\nthese technologies like FDDI They\n\n158\n00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:09.727\ncould do a FDDI, they could do dual rings.\n\n159\n00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:13.298\nOne ring was typically not used,\nit was just there for redundancy.\n\n160\n00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:17.059\nThat way if the outer ring failed, the\ninner ring could pick it up, or sometimes,\n\n161\n00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:20.022\nthey would actually use both\nrings to double up on throughput.\n\n162\n00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:23.230\nBut then if one failed,\nthey still had a single ring.\n\n163\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.650\nSo you do see some scenarios like that.\n\n164\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if I understand right, Mike,\nthe other thing too is the maximum speed\n\n165\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.760\nthat you're gonna eventually get,\nso like you said, double it up.\n\n166\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.888\nAnd don't worry about the numbers here,\nit's not really important,\n\n167\n00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:35.820\nI don't think, for the exam.\n\n168\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.140\nBut the fact of the matter is,\nyou had a maximum speed.\n\n169\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.541\nAnd that technology was\nfiber optic technology.\n\n170\n00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:44.456\nSo I can only imagine that the expense\nwas just through the roof.\n\n171\n00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:47.849\nAnd I can also think that today we\nhave cheaper technologies that can do\n\n172\n00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:48.720\nthe same speeds.\n\n173\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.080\nThe other one that I've also thought\nabout too is something known, and\n\n174\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.130\nanother acronym here,\n\n175\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.780\nFCAL, fiber channel alternating loop,\nwhich is a WAN technology.\n\n176\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.830\nBut personally,\nI've never actually used it.\n\n177\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's why you see these a lot in, or\n\n178\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.460\nmore so, in the WAN side of things.\n\n179\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.060\nThere are ring technologies that\naren't fiber that we can use in a LAN.\n\n180\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.707\nAnd a lot of older networks use this\nring topology before switches, and\n\n181\n00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:21.147\nEthernet became so easy and flexible to\nwork with, the ring was a viable solution.\n\n182\n00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:22.940\nI had a bus, I had a ring.\n\n183\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.545\nRing was just one choice I could make.\n\n184\n00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:25.820\nAnd so you did see it.\n\n185\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.550\nThe other great thing about the ring,\nor one of its upsides,\n\n186\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.310\nwas it was a deterministic.\n\n187\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.841\nYes, deterministic protocol, which\nmeant that everybody is gonna get time.\n\n188\n00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:42.794\nAnd these are some more terms that\nwe probably should be familiar with.\n\n189\n00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:45.520\nNetwork fundamentals,\nwe might as well throw it in here.\n\n190\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.040\nWhen we talk about these networks,\nthey can either be contention based, where\n\n191\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.750\nyou have to fight for time on the network,\nwhich is what our Ethernet is today.\n\n192\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.323\nOr they can be deterministic,\nwhich means everybody gets a turn, and\n\n193\n00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:01.726\nit doesn't matter.\n\n194\n00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:05.182\nWith the contention based, if you're\nnot quick enough to raise your hand or\n\n195\n00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:08.584\nif you're one of the shy guys sitting\nin the corner, you might never talk,\n\n196\n00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:11.050\nbecause you gotta fight for\ntime out there.\n\n197\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.890\nWell, with ring technology,\nit's deterministic.\n\n198\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.828\nThere's a token that gets passed around\nthe ring, and when that ring comes to you,\n\n199\n00:10:17.828 --> 00:10:21.840\nit's like that little children's game\nwhere you have a stick, I forget that.\n\n200\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.970\nIf you've got the stick, you're the one\nthat can talk, it's a same thing.\n\n201\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.000\nWhen you got the ring,\nyou can put your data in there, and\n\n202\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.800\nyou can send it on to the destination.\n\n203\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.060\nEverybody in the ring just looks at it,\nnot for me, and\n\n204\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.790\npasses it on to the next one\ntill that person gets it.\n\n205\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.960\nNow there are lots of little things\nyou can do within there, like hey,\n\n206\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.490\nI see the rings going by,\nit's full, I really need to speak.\n\n207\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.468\nI'm gonna flag it, and hopefully, I'll\nget it next when they're done with it.\n\n208\n00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:47.370\nBut I've gotta pass it on for\nnow because it's not my data.\n\n209\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.910\nWhy's that so great?\n\n210\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:55.170\nWell, in situations where I've got,\nI always think of industrial applications,\n\n211\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.280\nwhere I've got switches that\nare controlled, let's imagine this.\n\n212\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.990\nImagine, I always love the steel mills\nup in the northeastern United States.\n\n213\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.589\nThey've got these huge vats of liquid\nsteel being poured out, right,\n\n214\n00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:08.465\nby these big huge machines.\n\n215\n00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:13.360\nAnd whatever it's poured into gets full,\nthat thing needs to stop and\n\n216\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.680\nstop pouring molten lava,\nmolten steel into that mold.\n\n217\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.600\nWell, what if that switch was saying, hey,\nI'm full and trying to shut it off, but\n\n218\n00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.790\nWes was streaming videos?\n\n219\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.270\nHe's downloading some movie from\nthe Internet, and the network's busy and\n\n220\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.640\nthe switch is trying to talk,\nbut it can't.\n\n221\n00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.800\nSteadily pouring molten steel\nacross the floor of the,\n\n222\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.220\nI just see a picture of people running and\nyeah.\n\n223\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.588\n&gt;&gt; You dont want contention in the kill\nswitch to the nuclear power plant, right?\n\n224\n00:11:38.588 --> 00:11:42.080\n[LAUGH] So yeah, Mike, the other thing\nthat I thought about, and help me out\n\n225\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.330\nwith this one, is that one of the reasons\nyou might say, well, why is that?\n\n226\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.130\nThat seems very inefficient, and I'm\ngonna stand up and I'm gonna yell, hey,\n\n227\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.740\nI gotta send information.\n\n228\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.017\nAnd if I get it, I get it, and if I don't,\nI don't, contention based, right,\n\n229\n00:11:53.017 --> 00:11:55.864\nversus hey, you are going to get this\namount of time is that the devices\n\n230\n00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:58.547\nthemselves, right,\nare contention based switches and stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:58.547 --> 00:12:01.440\nThat contention makes them\na little bit cheaper, right?\n\n232\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.659\nThey don't have to put a lot of logic\nwhere if you're gonna make a determination\n\n233\n00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.230\nthat Mike, you're gonna talk now.\n\n234\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.680\nOkay, you stop, I'm gonna talk now.\n\n235\n00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.760\nThat device has to have more logic,\nand it can really skyrocket the price.\n\n236\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, the rules of\nthe language itself now have to change.\n\n237\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.160\nI have to teach everybody when\nthey can and when they can't talk.\n\n238\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.512\nWhat's allowed and what's not allowed,\nwhereas contention based, and\n\n239\n00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:23.570\nsay look, talk when you can, good luck.\n\n240\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.326\nAll right, and there's not a lot to it.\n\n241\n00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:26.900\nAll right, so let's get back to our rings.\n\n242\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.350\nAgain, we don't wanna go too far into it.\n\n243\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.090\nWe need to understand the basics,\n\n244\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.550\nif somebody says they're\nrunning a ring network, or\n\n245\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.760\nyou take over an enterprise and\nthey've got some ring topology in there.\n\n246\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.570\nYou need to understand what they mean by\nthat, some of the downfalls that I could\n\n247\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.170\nface, some of the pitfalls\nI might face with that.\n\n248\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.000\nSome of the goods and the bads of that\nprotocol, or that topology, I should say.\n\n249\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.332\nI've got another one here\ncuz this is also a ring.\n\n250\n00:12:50.332 --> 00:12:52.310\nI know, it doesn't look like a ring,\ndoes it?\n\n251\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.550\nYou're like, wait, Mike,\nwhat are you smoking?\n\n252\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.230\nThat is a ring.\n\n253\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.380\nBut because it's got a central\nconnectivity device,\n\n254\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.270\nthat's a special device.\n\n255\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.180\nNormally, a ring doesn't have\na central connectivity device.\n\n256\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:10.590\nBut with this ring, this is what they call\na multi-station access unit, or an MSAU.\n\n257\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.240\nAnd each device is basically\nstarred back to this.\n\n258\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.165\nBut internally,\nthe ring is built, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:23.820\nSo you're not seeing the ring,\nthe ring is inside that little box.\n\n260\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.230\nAnd the ring is being maintained.\n\n261\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.930\nAnd when this guy talks, you can\nimagine it coming in, going around,\n\n262\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.480\ncoming back out, going back in,\ncoming around, going out, right?\n\n263\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.500\nI mean it really is maintaining that ring.\n\n264\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.060\nThe cool thing about it is\nthe wiring is a lot easier.\n\n265\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.820\nI've got one loop, one wire coming\nout of each one of those nodes.\n\n266\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.240\nConnectivity wise within MSAU, here,\nif the ring breaks, everybody's down.\n\n267\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.820\nHere, if this cable breaks, well,\nthe MSAU can just skip that port,\n\n268\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.660\nand make sure the ring is still\ncontiguous internally, all right?\n\n269\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.950\nSo it eliminates some of that failure\nissue I have with the ring topology.\n\n270\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.350\nIt's still a ring,\nit's still deterministic.\n\n271\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.650\nIt still passes a token, depending on\nwhat protocol we're using on that ring.\n\n272\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.170\nBut just understand that a ring\ndoesn't have to be physically a ring.\n\n273\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.558\nAnd that brings me to another\nthing we should talk about.\n\n274\n00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:25.062\nWhen we talk about topologies,\nwe can talk about physical topology and\n\n275\n00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:30.028\nlogical topology,\na distinction that we need to make, right?\n\n276\n00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:31.895\nI'm trying to think of\na good example here.\n\n277\n00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:35.947\nPhysical topology,\nwe're talking about how it's laid out,\n\n278\n00:14:35.947 --> 00:14:40.420\nwhereas logical topology is how\nthe data is actually flowing.\n\n279\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.540\nThe drawing I've got up right now is\nactually a pretty good example of that.\n\n280\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.960\nPhysically, this represents a star, right,\neven though I've moved all the points up\n\n281\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.480\nto the stop of the star, it's an odd\nlooking star, but it's still a star.\n\n282\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.470\nSpokes coming out of that central\nconnectivity, so, physically, it's a star,\n\n283\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.080\nbut logically,\n\n284\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.000\nit's a ring because the packets\nare flowing from one node to the next.\n\n285\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.800\nThey just happen to be coming\nthrough this central connectivity.\n\n286\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.170\nSo do keep that in mind when we're talking\nabout topologies, you might wanna say,\n\n287\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.840\nphysically, we are this, but logically,\nit's behaving like this, right?\n\n288\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.800\nSo that's probably\nenough about topologies.\n\n289\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.400\nAgain, the big ones you need to be\nfamiliar with are gonna be bus, and\n\n290\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.000\nthen star, and then ring,\nand then mesh, right?\n\n291\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.770\nAnd we can do hybrids, I should mention\nthat term because you might see\n\n292\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.260\na hybrid topology or\na question about hybrid topologies.\n\n293\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.750\nIf I take two stars, right,\nI got that central connectivity device.\n\n294\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.390\nLet's see if I can do\nthis on the fly here.\n\n295\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.430\nLet me grab my arrow.\n\n296\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:43.010\nLet's say we took this star,\nand we made another star,\n\n297\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:49.752\nand then we ran a cable between\nthese two guys here, all right.\n\n298\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.770\nLet's not do red, we'll do white there.\n\n299\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.560\nAnd now what do I got?\n\n300\n00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.830\nWell I've really got a hybrid.\n\n301\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.574\nBecause I've got a bus\nbetween these two guys.\n\n302\n00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:03.994\nAnd you can imagine a third one or\na fourth one, right?\n\n303\n00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:06.076\nA bus connecting my switches.\n\n304\n00:16:06.076 --> 00:16:08.677\nBut then each switch is a star, right?\n\n305\n00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:09.628\nSo now I've got a hybrid.\n\n306\n00:16:09.628 --> 00:16:12.477\nI've got bus star hybrid topology.\n\n307\n00:16:12.477 --> 00:16:15.330\nSo you can take any of these topologies\nand mix them around together.\n\n308\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.987\nYou can put them in a bag, shake them up,\nand pour them out and see what you get.\n\n309\n00:16:17.987 --> 00:16:18.885\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n310\n00:16:18.885 --> 00:16:19.906\nA lot of planning involved.\n\n311\n00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:22.833\nYou wanna think about the pros, the cons,\nwhat you're trying to accomplish.\n\n312\n00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.974\nWhat we need when you're\ntalking about these topologies.\n\n313\n00:16:24.974 --> 00:16:28.500\n&gt;&gt; And you might ask yourself,\nwell where would I ever see a hybrid?\n\n314\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.920\nYou see Mike just drag a line\nreal quick between these two.\n\n315\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.870\nAnd he's right when it says, you got\na lot of different things in motion here.\n\n316\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.710\nWhere would you might see one of those?\n\n317\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.069\nOne of the things I think\nis like company mergers.\n\n318\n00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:43.955\nWhere a parent company, well, now a parent\ncompany comes in and buys another company.\n\n319\n00:16:43.955 --> 00:16:45.076\nAnd they've got something in place.\n\n320\n00:16:45.076 --> 00:16:47.797\nAnd it is not broken,\nwe won't fix it til it is broke.\n\n321\n00:16:47.797 --> 00:16:50.419\nAnd they are using something else and\nthey kind of attached to the two.\n\n322\n00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:50.936\nAnd then for\n\n323\n00:16:50.936 --> 00:16:54.466\nthe meantime, they can get by without\nupgrading everything on the one network.\n\n324\n00:16:54.466 --> 00:16:58.019\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, or take an enterprise that\nmaybe contains multiple floors, right?\n\n325\n00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:00.457\nI might have a switch on each floor.\n\n326\n00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:04.187\nAnd each node on that floor connects\nback to the switch on the same floor.\n\n327\n00:17:04.187 --> 00:17:08.369\nSo three floors, three switches, each node\nconnected to its own switch respectively.\n\n328\n00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:12.809\nAnd then a bus between the three floors\nconnecting those three switches.\n\n329\n00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:14.469\nThat's a hybrid topology.\n\n330\n00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:15.866\nCuz I've got a bus connecting my switches.\n\n331\n00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:18.505\nWhich has the same issues\nthat a normal bus has.\n\n332\n00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:21.721\nIf I lose the connection\nbetween those two switches.\n\n333\n00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:25.110\nAll three of those switches can no\nlonger communicate with each other.\n\n334\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.100\nSo, again, things to ponder when\nwe're talking about topologies.\n\n335\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.610\nAll right, now let's talk about some of\nthese devices that we have to deal with.\n\n336\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.170\nLet me grab another drawing.\n\n337\n00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:42.075\nAll right, so the first device\nI wanna talk about is a hub.\n\n338\n00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:45.922\nAnd a hub is on the bottom end of\nthe intelligence, if you will.\n\n339\n00:17:45.922 --> 00:17:48.260\nWhen it comes to these\ninterconnectivity devices.\n\n340\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.189\nAnd I'll explain as we go.\n\n341\n00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:56.190\nA hub doesn't look at the traffic or\nthe data or the packets or anything.\n\n342\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.790\nAn electrical signal comes in one port.\n\n343\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.170\nThat electrical signal is just re-routed\nout every other port on that hub,\n\n344\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.590\nall right?\n\n345\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.430\nSo for example here, I've got six\nnodes all connected back to this hub.\n\n346\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.360\nNode one sends some data in.\n\n347\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.710\nThat data will come out every other\nnode that's connected to that hub.\n\n348\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.237\nWhether it's broadcast traffic,\nwhether it's unicast, doesn't matter.\n\n349\n00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:23.602\nThe hub doesn't make any decisions.\n\n350\n00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:27.680\nIf something comes in, it just\nimmediately spits it out the other ports.\n\n351\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.807\nThat's all it does.\n\n352\n00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:32.281\nWhich was great way back in the beginning.\n\n353\n00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.504\nIt was a great way to do a star.\n\n354\n00:18:34.504 --> 00:18:39.272\nTo move from that bus type\ntopology to that star topology.\n\n355\n00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:42.451\nGot a central connectivity device,\nmade it really easy.\n\n356\n00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:45.657\nIf I had a hub in the middle of the office\nand somebody brought in a new computer.\n\n357\n00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:48.163\nAll I had to do was run a cable\nfrom their computer to the hub.\n\n358\n00:18:48.163 --> 00:18:53.260\nAnd it was now communicating with all\nthe other devices connected to that hub.\n\n359\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.130\nThe downside of a hub though, is the fact\nthat it doesn't make any decisions.\n\n360\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:02.319\nThat all that data gets spit out every\nother port and so it becomes noisy.\n\n361\n00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:03.583\nIt's not that the hub becomes noisy.\n\n362\n00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:09.088\nBut the network is gonna get saturated a\nlot quicker with a lot of extra traffic or\n\n363\n00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:10.085\nextra noise.\n\n364\n00:19:10.085 --> 00:19:14.661\nBecause it'd be like getting in a room\nwith, let's say you take five people and\n\n365\n00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:15.770\nput them in a room.\n\n366\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.804\nAnd everybody's talking.\n\n367\n00:19:16.804 --> 00:19:19.140\nIt's hard to hear each other person.\n\n368\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.700\nThere's three or\nfour conversations going on.\n\n369\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.160\nBut you can still talk.\n\n370\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.085\nBring ten more people,\nput them in the room.\n\n371\n00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:27.235\nBring ten more people,\nput them in the room.\n\n372\n00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:31.295\nPretty soon it becomes difficult to make\nout one conversation from the other.\n\n373\n00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.838\nAnd I'm trying to talk to Wes.\n\n374\n00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.740\nAnd I have to wait because,\nfirst this person's talking to Wes.\n\n375\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.817\nAnd I see them finish and I go to talk.\n\n376\n00:19:38.817 --> 00:19:42.215\nAnd before I can talk somebody else was\nquicker and they're talking to Wes.\n\n377\n00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:45.200\nIt becomes a challenge\nto even communicate.\n\n378\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.310\nAnd the same thing is\nhappening here on our network.\n\n379\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.520\nWith a hub like this,\nit does become a challenge to communicate.\n\n380\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.020\nAll right, so hubs,\n\n381\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.640\nsimple device that just pass all\ntraffic out every single port.\n\n382\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:04.890\nWe go to bridges, and bridges are a way\nthat we can kind of pick it up a notch.\n\n383\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:10.220\nA bridge is typically used to\ncreate separate broadcast domains,\n\n384\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.660\nright, to bridge networks together.\n\n385\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:19.690\nWhat's cool about a bridge is it actually\nlooks at what's called the MAC address.\n\n386\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.553\nAnd we haven't gotten into addressing yet,\nbut it keeps a table.\n\n387\n00:20:22.553 --> 00:20:24.630\nWes, do you remember the abbreviation CAM,\nI believe?\n\n388\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.720\n&gt;&gt; CAM, no, I'm not sure.\n\n389\n00:20:29.712 --> 00:20:31.235\nGosh, that term eludes me now.\n\n390\n00:20:31.235 --> 00:20:33.173\nBut basically the little\ntable that it keeps.\n\n391\n00:20:33.173 --> 00:20:34.510\nYou might have another term for it.\n\n392\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.634\n&gt;&gt; I just call it a MAC table.\n\n393\n00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:36.227\n&gt;&gt; MAC table.\n\n394\n00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:36.889\nOkay.\n\n395\n00:20:36.889 --> 00:20:39.416\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically the bridge keeps\n\n396\n00:20:39.416 --> 00:20:40.151\na little table.\n\n397\n00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:42.845\nAnd it looks at this data as it comes in.\n\n398\n00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:46.630\nAnd it figures out what MAC\naddresses lie at what ports.\n\n399\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.192\nAnd so what happens is when\nthere's unicast traffic.\n\n400\n00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:55.685\nIt can keep that traffic on\nthe same side or allow it to cross.\n\n401\n00:20:55.685 --> 00:20:57.068\nYou could almost divide this.\n\n402\n00:20:57.068 --> 00:21:00.262\nLet's see if I can draw a line\nright down the middle here.\n\n403\n00:21:00.262 --> 00:21:01.629\n[SOUND] Okay.\n\n404\n00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.290\nWe'll just draw a little line down there.\n\n405\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.969\nAnd so when I send traffic in,\nif it's destined for\n\n406\n00:21:06.969 --> 00:21:09.547\na MAC address that's on this side.\n\n407\n00:21:09.547 --> 00:21:12.417\nWell then that bridge will allow\nthat traffic to come out to all\n\n408\n00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.529\nthe ports on this side.\n\n409\n00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:16.280\nBut not the other side, all right?\n\n410\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.092\nIt's not gonna allow\nthat traffic over here.\n\n411\n00:21:18.092 --> 00:21:20.611\nIt means it wasn't destined for\nthese three on the right.\n\n412\n00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:22.270\nBut they don't even need to hear it.\n\n413\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.220\nThere's no need for them to hear it.\n\n414\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.940\nIf it was destined for the other\nside then it'll allow it through.\n\n415\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.980\nIt'll see the MAC address is\nlocated on the other side and\n\n416\n00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.700\nit'll allow it to go through.\n\n417\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.250\nSo that's basically what a bridge does.\n\n418\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:38.400\nIt allows me to connect to networks or\nto isolate basically two networks.\n\n419\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.410\nI can keep track of who's on one side and\nwho's on the other side.\n\n420\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.780\nAnd I can only allow that traffic to\nthe other side if it's destined for\n\n421\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.260\none of the nodes on the other side.\n\n422\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.865\nAll right?\n\n423\n00:21:48.865 --> 00:21:53.610\nWhen we get into a switch, so\na switch is a step up from a hub.\n\n424\n00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.432\nIt's a whole lot smarter than a hub.\n\n425\n00:21:55.432 --> 00:22:00.380\nIt can actually look at the data, the\ntraffic that's coming in and out of it.\n\n426\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.400\nAnd it can read it at layer two.\n\n427\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.540\nThe switch is what we\ncall a layer two device.\n\n428\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.821\nIt's looking at the MAC address or\nthe media access control addresses.\n\n429\n00:22:08.821 --> 00:22:12.965\nAnd the way a switch works is\nit has what we call a CAM table.\n\n430\n00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:15.434\nAnd Wes,\ndo you remember what CAM stands for?\n\n431\n00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:18.555\n&gt;&gt; That's the content-addressable memory.\n\n432\n00:22:18.555 --> 00:22:21.121\nI guess it's where the device\nitself stores information.\n\n433\n00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:21.836\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n434\n00:22:21.836 --> 00:22:25.064\nIt's right.\nAnd a switch learns over time.\n\n435\n00:22:25.064 --> 00:22:29.619\nWhen a packet comes in, each node is\nconnected to a single port on that switch.\n\n436\n00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:32.514\nAnd when that traffic comes\nfrom that node to the switch.\n\n437\n00:22:32.514 --> 00:22:35.810\nThe switch looks at that source address,\nthat source MAC address.\n\n438\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.577\nAnd it starts making a little table.\n\n439\n00:22:37.577 --> 00:22:42.275\nAnd says okay, the guy that sent traffic\ninto this port, this is his MAC address.\n\n440\n00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:46.865\nSo I can infer from that that if I ever\nhave anything to send to that MAC address,\n\n441\n00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.515\nit's out that port, right.\n\n442\n00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:52.592\nSo he's building up this little table,\nlearning who's connected to each port.\n\n443\n00:22:52.592 --> 00:22:56.762\nAnd when unicast traffic comes into that\nport, like this green arrow here, right?\n\n444\n00:22:56.762 --> 00:23:00.640\nWhen it comes in, it can look at the\ndestination address on that trap packet.\n\n445\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.218\nAnd it can say, I know what port he's out.\n\n446\n00:23:03.218 --> 00:23:05.992\nAnd send it out just that particular port.\n\n447\n00:23:05.992 --> 00:23:08.930\nNotice the yellow arrow is\nonly coming to this node here.\n\n448\n00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.370\nWhich is great.\n\n449\n00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.715\nWe talked about Ethernet\nbeing contention based.\n\n450\n00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:14.595\nI've gotta fight for time on the network.\n\n451\n00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:17.650\nWell, notice these other four nodes.\n\n452\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.690\nThey had no idea this\nconversation was going on.\n\n453\n00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.608\nThat traffic never hit their\npoint-to-point link between them and\n\n454\n00:23:23.608 --> 00:23:24.424\nthat switch.\n\n455\n00:23:24.424 --> 00:23:26.386\nAnd that's what makes switches so great.\n\n456\n00:23:26.386 --> 00:23:28.339\nAnd this is why we see them so often.\n\n457\n00:23:28.339 --> 00:23:30.166\nOne, they've come down in price.\n\n458\n00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:33.695\nThe technology has become\na lot less expensive.\n\n459\n00:23:33.695 --> 00:23:36.273\nWay back in the day I\ncouldn't afford a switch.\n\n460\n00:23:36.273 --> 00:23:37.276\nSo I had to put a hub in there.\n\n461\n00:23:37.276 --> 00:23:40.815\nAnd just deal with the fact that it didn't\nhelp me control the noise on my network.\n\n462\n00:23:40.815 --> 00:23:43.381\nNowadays, why would you ever buy a hub?\n\n463\n00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:46.017\nA hub, if you can find one,\nis probably more than a switch anyway.\n\n464\n00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:46.617\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n465\n00:23:46.617 --> 00:23:49.962\nwe don't get that massive conference call\nline that you were talking about when you\n\n466\n00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:51.362\nwere mentioning the hub, right.\n\n467\n00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:54.022\nWhere if one person talks\neverybody hears it.\n\n468\n00:23:54.022 --> 00:23:56.471\nAnd if you've got multiple people talking,\nwe can't get anything done.\n\n469\n00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:59.867\nBecause of the fact that this device\nis making a logical decision.\n\n470\n00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:02.228\nAnd saying, hey Mike, I know you need it.\n\n471\n00:24:02.228 --> 00:24:04.835\nBut the five other people over here,\nit's not to them.\n\n472\n00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:06.529\nWe start to see performance gains in this.\n\n473\n00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:07.340\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n474\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.887\nSo you take that room of people It's like\nme grabbing Wes and saying hey Wes come\n\n475\n00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:14.490\nhere and moving off into a corner or into\nlittle separate little office there and\n\n476\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.150\nsaying all right,\nwe're gonna have this conversation.\n\n477\n00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.280\nI don't have to deal with,\nthe other people don't need to hear it.\n\n478\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.137\nI'm not interfering with\nanything they're doing.\n\n479\n00:24:21.137 --> 00:24:23.610\nThey're not interfering\nwith my conversation.\n\n480\n00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.220\nIt's much nicer and neater.\n\n481\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.600\nBroadcast traffic, traffic that\ndoes not have a destination, right?\n\n482\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.070\nBroadcast means I'm sending it\nout to the network, to everybody.\n\n483\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.470\nThere's no specific node for\nthe destination.\n\n484\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.520\nWell a switch can't do anything\nwith that because I don't know\n\n485\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.040\nwhose address it's going to so all I\ncan do is just spit it out every port.\n\n486\n00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.650\nSo broadcast traffic still\ngoes out every port.\n\n487\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.720\nUnicast traffic is now limited\nto the destination port.\n\n488\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.250\nAnd again, this is what you're gonna\nsee in just about every modern network,\n\n489\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.320\nlocal area network that you work in,\nin some form or fashion.\n\n490\n00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.680\nLast interconnectivity device I\nwanna talk about is a router.\n\n491\n00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.020\nAnd the router is the genius of the bunch\nhere, compared to the hub and the switch.\n\n492\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.680\nA router works at layer three.\n\n493\n00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.440\nNow some of you might, if you've got\na little experience, you might think wait,\n\n494\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.180\nI've got layer three switches, Mike.\n\n495\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.704\nThere are some layer three switches\nthat kind of cross the line\n\n496\n00:25:17.704 --> 00:25:20.934\nbetween switches and routers, all right?\n\n497\n00:25:20.934 --> 00:25:25.160\nFor the exam, for network fundamentals,\nwe wanna think about what a hub is,\n\n498\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.120\nwhat a switch is, what a router is.\n\n499\n00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.520\nSo I understand that there\nare devices that cross that line, but\n\n500\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.670\nbefore you can understand those\ndevices being merge together.\n\n501\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.810\nYou gotta understand the individuals,\nwhat they were before they got merge.\n\n502\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.125\nSo that is why I'm kinda\ndealing with these separately.\n\n503\n00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:42.005\nSo let's say a router's gonna\nbe our layer three device.\n\n504\n00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:47.190\nIt's moving up the network stack or\nworking up one layer in the OSI model.\n\n505\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.630\nIt's looking at the IP address,\ndepending on the protocol we're using, but\n\n506\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.220\nit's looking at the network address,\nnot the MAC address,\n\n507\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:00.500\nwhich means a router can actually route\npackets from one network to another.\n\n508\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.250\nSomething we didn't mention with a switch,\n\n509\n00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.820\nlet's jump back over to here,\nall these nodes are on the same network.\n\n510\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.480\nThey all have to be on\nthe exact same network.\n\n511\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.200\nWe're gonna talk about addressing, and\n\n512\n00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.750\nhow I can determine that,\nin just a little bit.\n\n513\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.250\nBut these are all on the same network,\nall right?\n\n514\n00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.730\nI can't connect two different networks\nwith a switch, it won't work.\n\n515\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.824\nSwitches don't allow me to get out to\nthe internet because the internet's\n\n516\n00:26:22.824 --> 00:26:24.112\na different network, right?\n\n517\n00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:29.630\nSo a switch is only used within a network\nto connect nodes on the same network.\n\n518\n00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.440\nWell, I might have a situation where\nI've got more than one network\n\n519\n00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.710\nthat I need to connect.\n\n520\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.890\nHow do we do that?\n\n521\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.300\nWe do that with routers.\n\n522\n00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.450\nRouters are the ones that can,\nagain, look at the network address.\n\n523\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.169\nAnd they can make decisions based on that.\n\n524\n00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:45.678\nAnd it looks like, I don't know\nwhat I did with my arrows, but\n\n525\n00:26:45.678 --> 00:26:46.800\nthey are all wrong on here.\n\n526\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.287\nI think I was copying pasting and\nforgot to adjust.\n\n527\n00:26:51.287 --> 00:26:51.990\nNo, maybe I didn't.\n\n528\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.070\nI think I got it right.\n\n529\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.100\nSo let's talk about the way a router\nhandles traffic, all right?\n\n530\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.770\nSo same thing.\n\n531\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.610\nI gotta node that's sending out some data,\n\n532\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.160\nand let's say the destination\nis this node over here.\n\n533\n00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.785\nIt's on a different network.\n\n534\n00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:09.110\nWhen I send that packet, I'm gonna send\nit to what's known as my default gateway\n\n535\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.850\nwhich is connected to\nmy switch right here.\n\n536\n00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:12.780\nAnd that's a router.\n\n537\n00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.670\nA router is gonna be your default\ngateway or at least one port on there.\n\n538\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.526\nThe router then looks at the destination\nand says, that's going over to Subnet 2.\n\n539\n00:27:21.526 --> 00:27:22.658\nI know where that is.\n\n540\n00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:25.680\nI'm connected to it via\nthis cable over here.\n\n541\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.840\nAnd he can send it out.\n\n542\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.973\nAnd to the switch, the router interface is\njust another node on that switch, right?\n\n543\n00:27:31.973 --> 00:27:36.635\nSo I really have one, two, three,\nfour devices connected to this switch.\n\n544\n00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:41.810\nI also have one, two, three,\nfour devices connected this switch.\n\n545\n00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.020\nThe routers connected to both switches.\n\n546\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.334\nSo he's got an address\nthat's valid on this subnet.\n\n547\n00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:50.200\nHe's got another address that's\nvalid on this subnet over here.\n\n548\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.650\nAnd the router can then route packets\nbetween the networks, all right?\n\n549\n00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.130\nAnother thing routers do for us, besides\nthe ability to connect two separate\n\n550\n00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.940\nnetworks, is they create what we\ncall contention domains, right?\n\n551\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:09.310\nWhere, broadcast traffic doesn't go\nthrough a router, by default, right?\n\n552\n00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.280\nThat can be adjusted, but by default,\na router drops broadcast traffic.\n\n553\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.150\nSo if I send out a packet that's\ndestined for the network address,\n\n554\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.960\neverybody on my network hears it,\nthis node hears it, this node hears it.\n\n555\n00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.030\nEven the router would hear it cuz he\nis on my network, he's on this switch.\n\n556\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.330\nBut the router's not gonna\nlet it go any further.\n\n557\n00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.210\nRemember what a switch does?\n\n558\n00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.220\nA switch says, it's going to the network,\n\n559\n00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.850\nI'm just gonna put it out every port,\neverybody should get it.\n\n560\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.140\nThe router says, it's not going\nany further than me, all right?\n\n561\n00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.710\nBecause I know that beyond\nme is not the same network.\n\n562\n00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.759\nSo when you send broadcast to the network,\nwhy would I let it go any further than me?\n\n563\n00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.383\nIt's a different network on\nthe other side of me, all right?\n\n564\n00:28:50.383 --> 00:28:52.380\nSo it creates those contention domains.\n\n565\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:57.095\nIt limits that broadcast, that noise,\nto this particular subnet.\n\n566\n00:28:57.095 --> 00:28:59.610\nUnicast traffic can still\nget through just fine.\n\n567\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.470\nBroadcast traffic will be\nstopped there at that router.\n\n568\n00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.690\nSo when we're looking at it, you know,\n\n569\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.770\nrouters are kind of\nthe genius of the bunch.\n\n570\n00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.520\nAgain, they can make more decisions.\n\n571\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.740\nThey can do much more than\nwhat we just talked about.\n\n572\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.510\nBut for now,\nthat's what we understand about a router,\n\n573\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:18.340\nis that it connects different networks,\nwhen we're looking at network addresses.\n\n574\n00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.680\nEven to similar networks.\n\n575\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.300\nRouters can be,\n\n576\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:25.040\nwhat we call, gateway routers where they\nconnect different types of networks.\n\n577\n00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.360\nMaybe one's running ethernet,\none's running token ring.\n\n578\n00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.600\nThis router could connect between the two.\n\n579\n00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.240\nSo, routers are the smart\nones of the bunch.\n\n580\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.130\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell that's a lot of great information.\n\n581\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.640\nAnd if this is the first time\nyou've been into networking,\n\n582\n00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.505\nif you've never done this before,\nwe want you to go back and\n\n583\n00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:44.920\nre-watch a couple of these videos so\nyou know, that you know what's going on.\n\n584\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.870\nNow, I can say that we've got more\ninformation on when it comes to networking\n\n585\n00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.070\nfundamentals here in the GSEC series.\n\n586\n00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.200\nHowever, I'm looking at the time clock,\nMike,\n\n587\n00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.810\nand I think we're flexing\nthe muscles there on the clock.\n\n588\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.340\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n589\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:57.990\nBut before we do,\n\n590\n00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.690\ndo you have any additional words you\nwould think on maybe the network devices?\n\n591\n00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.670\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of any.\n\n592\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n593\n00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.270\nWell, that's a great place to wrap up.\n\n594\n00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.770\nWe appreciate you, Mike, being here.\n\n595\n00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.800\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n596\n00:30:09.800 -->

00:00:11.549\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.290\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.770\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.540\nwe are moving through our GIA security,\nGIAC security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.000\nApparently, an acronym\nthat I can not speak.\n\n8\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.840\nWe're actually coming back for a part\nthree here at networking fundamentals and\n\n9\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.430\njoining us for and tackling that obstacle\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.300\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.860\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.940\nAnd yeah, there's a lot to it, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.980\nWe were talking about networking\nfundamentals, a lot of things that we've\n\n15\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.470\ngotta make sure we are familiar with\nbefore we move on to the more complex or\n\n16\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.770\nthe higher level topics.\n\n17\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.710\nSo in the previous episodes\nwe've done a lot already.\n\n18\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.050\nWe've talked about basic network\ntypes like LANs and WANs.\n\n19\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.010\nWe talked about topologies, bus,\nstar, mesh, talked about devices,\n\n20\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.550\ninterconnectivity devices, hubs,\nswitches, routers, bridges.\n\n21\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.260\nNext thing we need to tackle\nas Wes liked to say it.\n\n22\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.850\nWe're going to look at addressing or\ntackle the problem of addressing, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.740\nCuz somehow I've got to\naddress these notes.\n\n24\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.260\nIf we're gonna send and receive data\nthen I have to have a way to address\n\n25\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.730\nthe different devices that are gonna\nbe able to receive or send data, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.700\nIf I'm gonna send you data then I\nneed to know what the address is, so\n\n27\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.620\nI can send it to you.\n\n28\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.130\nIf I want anything back, you better have\nmy address so you can send it back to me.\n\n29\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.078\nSo if you had to address our devices, and\n\n30\n00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.127\nthere's different addressing\nschemes we're gonna look at.\n\n31\n00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:37.924\nWe're gonna look at IPv4 and\nIPv6 in this particular episode, or\n\n32\n00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:40.120\nthis next couple of episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.410\nCuz there is a lot to it.\n\n34\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Now you've talked about in the past,\nyou've talked about some of\n\n35\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.410\nthe types of networks that we've had\nout there, like you've mentioned.\n\n36\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.790\nWe've talked about topologies.\n\n37\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.390\nNow, why do we need an address?\n\n38\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.470\nWhy do I even need an address, Mike?\n\n39\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, like I was saying.\n\n40\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830\nIt's just so I can send and\nreceive information.\n\n41\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.200\nLet's go to the mail system, right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.360\nIf you want to send\nyour mother a postcard,\n\n43\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.740\nyou need to know her address, right?\n\n44\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.360\nYou need to know where she is.\n\n45\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.400\nSo, you can write that on that postcard,\nput it in the mail and\n\n46\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.550\nthen that mail person can then deliver\nthat postcard to wherever it is,\n\n47\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.680\nwhatever address you put on there.\n\n48\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.290\nSo, without an address, I can't\nreally send and receive information.\n\n49\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.230\nAnd so, and\nthat's the whole joy of computers.\n\n50\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.060\nIf there's one computer,\nit really doesn't need an address.\n\n51\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.970\nYou're not talking to anybody,\nnobody is talking to you.\n\n52\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.210\nBut as soon as we came up with\ntwo computers which was way,\n\n53\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.309\nway back in the day, right?\n\n54\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.760\nWe needed an addressing scheme and there\nhas been one around of course since then.\n\n55\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.200\nAgain, we're gonna look at IPv4 and\nits successor IPv6 because that is out.\n\n56\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.550\nIt's out there,\nwe need to be familiar with it.\n\n57\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.930\nIt's being used whether you like it or\nnot.\n\n58\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.850\nYou're probably using it\nwhether you know it or\n\n59\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.190\nnot depending on what operating\nsystem you're running.\n\n60\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.010\nSo we need to be familiar with that\nas well, because IPv4 will slowly\n\n61\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.920\nstart to disappear and\nof course it goes along with like wins,\n\n62\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.330\nWindows internet name service if\nyou're not familiar with that one.\n\n63\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.440\nIts been around for a long time ever since\nI've been in computers I think I've been\n\n64\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.600\nsaying wins is going to disappear one day,\nand yet it's still there.\n\n65\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I remember in fact\na company that we used to work for\n\n66\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.520\nwhen I first started out Mike and\nI did work together.\n\n67\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.300\nAnd I remember you saying that and you've\ndefinitely been in computers longer and\n\n68\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.630\nI've been saying it too, but\nit definitely rears its head now.\n\n69\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.480\nMike, with any you mentioned\na mail carrier system.\n\n70\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410\nIf we're gonna deliver mail,\nat least here in the states,\n\n71\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.280\nif you're watching from a different\nlocation it might be slightly different.\n\n72\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.340\nIt's got some kind of format and\nkind of structure.\n\n73\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.280\nSo we're gonna have to probably know\nthe structure if we're gonna work with\n\n74\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.860\nthese addresses.\n\n75\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.260\nIs that where we're gonna start today?\n\n76\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and so let's start\neven one step further back than that\n\n77\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.190\nis the numbering systems themselves.\n\n78\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.990\nCuz we don't actually use\nwhat we're familiar with.\n\n79\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.610\nWe do in a way, right?\n\n80\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.890\nWhat I'm talking about is\na base ten numbering system,\n\n81\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.160\nbeen around since\nthe beginning of history.\n\n82\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.820\nIt's one of the oldest numbering\nsystems that old base ten,\n\n83\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.590\nour decimal numbering system.\n\n84\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.600\nTen possibilities per digit,\nzero through nine.\n\n85\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.130\nWe're almost all of us should\nbe familiar with that.\n\n86\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.050\nBut a couple of other numbering systems\nthat we need to be familiar with as\n\n87\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.430\nwe learn to work with computers.\n\n88\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.300\nAnd especially in addressing,\nis gonna be base two, binary.\n\n89\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.290\nAs well as base 16, or hexadecimal.\n\n90\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.530\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nI'll show you what we've got.\n\n91\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.420\nBase ten, again, what we're familiar with.\n\n92\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.010\nOur decimal numbering system.\n\n93\n00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.160\nTen possibilities per digit,\nzero through nine.\n\n94\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.060\nBinary is a base two numbering system,\ntwo possibilities per digit, 0 and a 1.\n\n95\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.000\nAnd then we've got our hexidecimal, which\nis base 16, which is gonna go 0 through 9,\n\n96\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.390\nwhere we kind of run out of single\ndigit numbers to represent, so\n\n97\n00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.050\nwe had to switch over to letters.\n\n98\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.930\nAnd go A through F all right.\n\n99\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.500\nF would actually be a 15 right, 0 counts.\n\n100\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.320\nSo there's 16 digits, 0 through F all\nright, so don't forget about 0 up there.\n\n101\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.250\nAnd what we need to be\nable to do is convert\n\n102\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.860\nbetween the different numbering systems.\n\n103\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.760\nCuz depending on what we're\nlooking at determines what\n\n104\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.240\nnumbering system we're gonna be using.\n\n105\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.740\nFor example, in a Windows operating\nsystem, when you go into your network\n\n106\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.480\nproperties and you statically map an IP\naddress, you're not typing in hexidecimal.\n\n107\n00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.760\nYou're not typing in binary.\n\n108\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.950\nYou're typing in decimal.\n\n109\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.870\nBut when you're looking in a packet,\nin a packet capture utility like TCPDUMP,\n\n110\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.770\nor Wireshark, and you're reading\nthe source and destination address.\n\n111\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.640\nGuess what?\n\n112\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.780\nThey're in hexadecimal and\nall of it gets converted back to binary at\n\n113\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.880\nsome point because the computers only\ncare about ones and zeroes, ons or offs.\n\n114\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.410\nThat's all they deal with.\n\n115\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.890\nAll the other stuff is really for\n\n116\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.400\nare readability programmability if\ni can slow down and say that, and\n\n117\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.010\nspace saving because writing out 1000's\nand 1's and 0's is a pain in the butt.\n\n118\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.760\nSo really the other number systems are for\n\n119\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.280\nour benefit,\nthe computers just go with binary.\n\n120\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.070\nSo lets talk a little bit about\nconverting from one to the other.\n\n121\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.910\nLet's start with hex while we're here.\n\n122\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.020\nBecause this is one I think that most\npeople are not as familiar with.\n\n123\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.230\nRemember hexadecimal is\na base 16 numbering system.\n\n124\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.630\nAnd the way this is gonna work,\n\n125\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.390\nis each hexadecimal digit,\nis gonna take four bits.\n\n126\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.880\nFour binary bits to represent, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.000\nWhich is actually called a nibble..\n\n128\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.970\nAll right cuz a byte is eight bits,\nso four bits is a nibble.\n\n129\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.740\nBut that's another story,\nwe'll talk about that some other day.\n\n130\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.690\nSo to be able to convert again,\n\n131\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.350\neach hexadecimal digit is gonna be\nrepresented by four binary digits.\n\n132\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.810\nSo a 0 in hexadecimal is a 0 in binary,\nbut notice how I've got four 0s there.\n\n133\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.980\nNot just a single 0.\n\n134\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.750\nWe want to make sure we always\nhave four bits sitting there.\n\n135\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.460\nIf I jump down to a 9,\nyou guys are probably familiar with this.\n\n136\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.200\nWe'll go over it in just a second,\nbut a 9 in binary is 1 0 0 1.\n\n137\n00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.510\nA 10 in binary is 1 0 1 0.\n\n138\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.790\nA 15 in binary is 1 1 1 1.\n\n139\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.710\nSo when you look at these,\na 15 an F and a 1 1 1 1.\n\n140\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.900\nAll three are the same number\nin different numbering formats.\n\n141\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.190\nIt's a 15 in decimal, it's an F in\nhexadecimal, and it's a 1 1 1 1 in binary.\n\n142\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.070\nSo three different ways to represent\nthe exact same number, right?\n\n143\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.310\nNow, lets look at our hexidecimal,\nI'm sorry,\n\n144\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.280\nour binary place values first\ncuz we are gonna need to know\n\n145\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.415\nthat before we can start working\nwith converting back and forth.\n\n146\n00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.740\nSo I'm gonna start over here on the what\nwe call the least significant bit and\n\n147\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.820\nwork my way from right to left.\n\n148\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.513\nThat first digit in binary is worth 1.\n\n149\n00:07:40.513 --> 00:07:47.368\nThe next place value in binary is worth 2,\nand then 4, and then 8.\n\n150\n00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:48.899\nAnd what's next Wes, help me out.\n\n151\n00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:55.515\n&gt;&gt; 16, 32, 64 and 128.\n\n152\n00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:56.980\nNow, these Place Values.\n\n153\n00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.787\nThe thing that I remember would be\nbecause that's about all I remember from\n\n154\n00:08:00.787 --> 00:08:01.760\nschool, really.\n\n155\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.798\nIs that the Place Values you talk\nabout in base ten, you mention,\n\n156\n00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:08.050\nthat what we see every day,\nis the ones place, the tens place.\n\n157\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.762\nHundreds and thousands, so in binary,\nthat's close to what we're saying here.\n\n158\n00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:15.170\n&gt;&gt; It's the exact same thing\nas we ride in a binary number,\n\n159\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.820\nwe just look at what\ncolumn basically is in.\n\n160\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.950\nWhat that place value is, and\nwith binary, it's pretty simple,\n\n161\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.690\nit's either zero or one.\n\n162\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.900\nZero is saying off, one is on.\n\n163\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.721\nSo, if that bid is off, then that number\ndoesn't count, if that bid is on, or\n\n164\n00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:32.122\na one, it does count.\n\n165\n00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:38.335\nLet me give you an example,\nlet's take the number, something like 200.\n\n166\n00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:43.800\nAll right, so we want the number 200, let\nme move that down, represents in binary.\n\n167\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.686\nSo, when you're doing number like this,\nconverting from decimal to binary,\n\n168\n00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.368\nwe simply gonna use subtraction,\n\n169\n00:08:49.368 --> 00:08:52.618\nand you're gonna start from the most\nsignificant bit and go down.\n\n170\n00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:54.154\nAll right, so the number is 200.\n\n171\n00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.901\nIs that greater than or less than 128?\n\n172\n00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:01.910\nCan I subtract 128 from my number?\n\n173\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.523\nYes, I can.\nThat means I can turn that bit on.\n\n174\n00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:06.258\nSo, we'll make that a one.\n\n175\n00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:11.196\nAnd then I'm simply gonna\nsubtract 200 minus 128,\n\n176\n00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.171\nwhich gives me-\n&gt;&gt; 72.\n\n177\n00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:16.124\n&gt;&gt; 72, all right?\n\n178\n00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:18.911\nSo, 72 is the answer, I'm trying to think,\nlet me just highlight that, so\n\n179\n00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:20.707\nwe can see that's the answer and\nnot the problem.\n\n180\n00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:22.651\nSo 72, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.036\nSo, the next number is 64.\n\n182\n00:09:24.036 --> 00:09:27.740\nCan I get 64 out of 72?\n\n183\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.940\nYes, I can.\n\n184\n00:09:30.124 --> 00:09:31.769\nSorry, yeah,\nthat's going behind my head a little bit.\n\n185\n00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:37.397\nThere's my math over here, so 200 minus\n128 leaves me with a remainder of 72.\n\n186\n00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:43.092\nSo, that means I can subtract 64 from 72,\nso I'm going to turn that bit on,\n\n187\n00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:48.447\nand that should not be red, some old\nformatting left over from somewhere.\n\n188\n00:09:48.447 --> 00:09:50.639\nLet's go with our black there.\n\n189\n00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.168\nSo, we'll turn that bit on.\n\n190\n00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:55.064\n&gt;&gt; And that leaves us with eight-\n&gt;&gt; I [CROSSTALK]\n\n191\n00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:58.279\n&gt;&gt; We'll just fix this whole column real\n\n192\n00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:58.986\nquick.\n\n193\n00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:01.389\nLet's make sure we default\nthat back to black.\n\n194\n00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:05.547\nAll right, so\nthen we'll subtract out 64 from 72,\n\n195\n00:10:05.547 --> 00:10:09.180\nwhich leaves me, six, seven, eight, right?\n\n196\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.642\nIf I did my math right there.\n\n197\n00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:12.369\nSo, eight is, again, the answer.\n\n198\n00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:15.870\nI'm not gonna bother color coding it,\ntoo much trouble.\n\n199\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.630\nSo, can I subtract 32, or\ncan I subtract 32 out of eight?\n\n200\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.414\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.\n\n201\n00:10:20.414 --> 00:10:22.494\n&gt;&gt; No, 32 won't come out of there.\n\n202\n00:10:22.494 --> 00:10:23.970\nSo, we're gonna have to turn that bit off.\n\n203\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.522\nI can't use the 32.\n\n204\n00:10:25.522 --> 00:10:27.353\nWhat about, can I get 16 out of eight?\n\n205\n00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:28.800\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a no go as well.\n\n206\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, so leave that bit off.\n\n207\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.280\nCan I get eight out of eight?\n\n208\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we can use that.\n\n209\n00:10:32.267 --> 00:10:32.787\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n210\n00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:34.324\nSo, we'll turn that one on.\n\n211\n00:10:34.324 --> 00:10:35.419\nBut now we have nothing left, Mike.\n\n212\n00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:38.404\n&gt;&gt; Eight minus eight, exactly, is zero.\n\n213\n00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.804\nSo, can I get four out of zero?\n\n214\n00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:43.270\nNo, can't get anything out of zero, right?\n\n215\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.120\nSo, the rest of them are gonna be zeroes.\n\n216\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.070\nAnd there we go.\n\n217\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.868\nThis, one, one, zero, zero,\none, zero, zero, zero.\n\n218\n00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:53.204\nIs 200 in binary?\n\n219\n00:10:53.204 --> 00:10:55.371\nRight, so we can come over here and\nwe can write that out.\n\n220\n00:10:55.371 --> 00:11:02.769\n11001000 is going to be\nthe binary representation of 200.\n\n221\n00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:05.600\nAll right, and it works just the opposite.\n\n222\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.430\nWhat if we didn't know\nwhat that number was?\n\n223\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.585\nAll right, let's say we did this for\nconverting the other way, right?\n\n224\n00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:21.822\nLet's say I had the binary\nnumber 10110110, right?\n\n225\n00:11:21.822 --> 00:11:25.550\nI need to know what that is in decimal.\n\n226\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.860\nWell, instead of subtracting,\nnow we're gonna add the place values.\n\n227\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.400\nSo I've got the 128 strand on, all right?\n\n228\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.560\nI can see a one there, so\nthat's going to be 128 plus,\n\n229\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.030\nno 64s, that one's turned off.\n\n230\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.206\nThere's a 32 turned on.\n\n231\n00:11:40.206 --> 00:11:45.771\nSo, we'll do 32, and then we've got\n16 is turned on, so we'll do that.\n\n232\n00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.830\nAnd again, sorry about the green there.\n\n233\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.260\nThere's a four, there's a two.\n\n234\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.109\nBut there's no eights, and there's no\nones, eights turned off, ones turned off.\n\n235\n00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:58.365\nSo, if we take those numbers and\njust a real quick auto sum, bada bing.\n\n236\n00:11:58.365 --> 00:11:59.485\n&gt;&gt; I got 178, or 182?\n\n237\n00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.446\n&gt;&gt; 182, did I do that right?\n\n238\n00:12:01.446 --> 00:12:02.293\n&gt;&gt; No, you did that right.\n\n239\n00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:08.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so 182 is this number in binary.\n\n240\n00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.560\nSee how that works?\n\n241\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.310\nSo, all we're gonna do is\ntake our decimal value, and\n\n242\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.880\nstart subtracting to convert it into\nbinary, taking each place value,\n\n243\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.210\nturning it on if we can, and then\nsubtracting that from the original number,\n\n244\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.450\nseeing what we have left,\nseeing if I can turn the next bit on.\n\n245\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.470\nTo convert from binary back to decimal,\n\n246\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.840\nI'm just adding up the place values,\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.250\nIt's just like you would in\nthe base ten numbering system.\n\n248\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:36.190\nThe number 240, for example, well,\nthere's a two in the 100s spot.\n\n249\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.150\nSo that means I've got 100 and 100.\n\n250\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.880\nThere's a four in the ten spot.\n\n251\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.186\nSo that's 10, 10, 10, 10.\n\n252\n00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:46.075\nThere's zero in the one spot.\n\n253\n00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.224\nSo, there's zero ones.\n\n254\n00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:53.641\nIf I add all of those up,\nwe get 240, right?\n\n255\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.130\nSo I mean, it's not a new concept,\nit's just a different numbering system.\n\n256\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.250\nAnd there's only two\npossibilities per digit.\n\n257\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.590\nThat's what you have to get used to,\nand what the place values are.\n\n258\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.480\nNow Wes, did you see the pattern in this?\n\n259\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.410\nThere was a pattern in there.\n\n260\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.794\nThe first one was a one, then a two,\nthen a four, then an eight.\n\n261\n00:13:08.794 --> 00:13:12.637\n&gt;&gt; One of things I've noticed is moving\nfrom the left, or you said the least\n\n262\n00:13:12.637 --> 00:13:17.070\nsignificant bit back to the right, is that\nit starts with one and then it doubles.\n\n263\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.667\nAnd I've also noticed that\nit's eight bits wide.\n\n264\n00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:22.036\n&gt;&gt; Yes, except for\nwe're going from the right to the left.\n\n265\n00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.108\n&gt;&gt; I say left,\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n266\n00:13:23.108 --> 00:13:26.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:13:26.768 --> 00:13:27.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n268\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.660\nwhat if we went to this digit?\n\n269\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.900\nWhat place value do you think\nthis digit in binary would be?\n\n270\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.982\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say 256.\n\n271\n00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:36.238\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if I were to go one more,\nwhat do you think that one's gonna be?\n\n272\n00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:37.094\n&gt;&gt; 512?\n\n273\n00:13:37.094 --> 00:13:42.466\n&gt;&gt; 512, and the next one'd be 1,024 and\n2,048 and 4,096 and 8192, right?\n\n274\n00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:45.582\nIt just keeps doubling over and\nover and over again.\n\n275\n00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:48.350\nAnd so,\nno matter how big your binary number is,\n\n276\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.630\nyou can figure out what\nthe place value is.\n\n277\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.930\nLuckily for us though,\nwhen it comes to addressing,\n\n278\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.100\ncuz that's really what we're doing here,\nwe're not learning just numbering systems.\n\n279\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.630\nWe're dealing with IPv4 addresses, and\n\n280\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.630\nwe divide up this address\ninto eight bit chunks.\n\n281\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.670\nSo I'll show you in just a second.\n\n282\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.600\nSo really,\nthese are what you need to know.\n\n283\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.400\nThese eight places values, if you can\nmemorize those you're good to go.\n\n284\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.800\nAll right, again, this isn't network plus.\n\n285\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.210\nWe're gonna move on from this.\n\n286\n00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.720\nIf this is something you're rusty with,\nor you haven't seen before,\n\n287\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.110\nmake sure you go and do some research,\njump into our course library.\n\n288\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.380\nWatch network plus, watch our subnetting\nshows as we get into subnetting here.\n\n289\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.280\nMake sure you brush up on this, cuz it\nis important that you understand it.\n\n290\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.170\nAll right, now, let's look at hexadecimal,\n\n291\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.420\nhexadecimal is a little\nmore difficult to convert.\n\n292\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.960\nThere are some mathematical\nformulas you can\n\n293\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.500\nuse to convert straight from\nhex to decimal, all right?\n\n294\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:45.670\nIt has to do with multiplying it by\nthe place value, it gets a little complex.\n\n295\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.800\nIt's not that bad once you\nplay around with it, but\n\n296\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.810\nI'm gonna show you just\na real easy way to do it,\n\n297\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.190\nbecause we're not becoming\nmathematicians for this exam, right?\n\n298\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.440\nI need to be able to look at a packet,\nand see these numbers in hex, and\n\n299\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.110\nconvert them so that I can figure\nout what the source IP address is,\n\n300\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.150\nor the destination IP address is, or\nwhat flag is set, and things like that.\n\n301\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.360\nThat's really what I\nneed to be able to do.\n\n302\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.160\nSo, we don't have to\ntake this to the extreme.\n\n303\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.570\nSo, the easiest way I find\nto work with converting\n\n304\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.480\nhex into decimal is to go hex binary,\nbecause that's pretty easy, and\n\n305\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.290\nthen binary to decimal,\nbecause that's pretty easy.\n\n306\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.010\nAnd the same thing,\nif I wanted to go to decimal to hex,\n\n307\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.720\nI would convert my decimal into binary,\nand then my binary into hex.\n\n308\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.700\nThat's just me, if you want to\nplay around with the formulas\n\n309\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.230\nwhere you can calculate out going\nstraight from hex to decimal, feel free.\n\n310\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.724\nSo, let's just take a number, random\nnumber here, I've got a bunch of ones and\n\n311\n00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:42.442\nzeroes as my binary number that I\nwanna convert into hexadecimal.\n\n312\n00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:48.010\nWhat we have to remember is each\nhexadecimal digit is four binary bits.\n\n313\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.293\nAll right, so that means every\nfour binary bits is gonna be\n\n314\n00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:53.841\nconverted into a single hexadecimal digit.\n\n315\n00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:57.324\nSo what I need to do with this number\nis break it up into chunks of four,\n\n316\n00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:57.950\nall right.\n\n317\n00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.080\nSo I just start from the right and\nwork my way over.\n\n318\n00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.620\nThe last four numbers, 0, 0, 1, 1.\n\n319\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.781\nThe next set of four numbers, 1, 0, 1, 0.\n\n320\n00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:08.940\nAnd then 0011 and then 1111.\n\n321\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.990\nSo this number just broken up\ninto groups of four, right.\n\n322\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.596\nNow that I've got it four bits,\nit's easy to convert it to hex.\n\n323\n00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:21.685\nA 1111 is an F, it's 15.\n\n324\n00:16:21.685 --> 00:16:25.250\nA 0010, think about your binary.\n\n325\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.850\nRight here.\n\n326\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.120\nLet's even do it without my\ncheat sheet chart over there.\n\n327\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.730\nI wanna convert 1010 to hex.\n\n328\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.400\nWell 1010, whoops.\n\n329\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.350\nYeah, I goofed that one up.\n\n330\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.540\nLet's delete that.\n\n331\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.809\nLet's say we got a 1010.\n\n332\n00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:49.540\nAll right, we'll add those up cuz we know\nwe're gonna convert to decimal, so we add.\n\n333\n00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.727\nI've got an 8, I don't have any 4s,\nI've got a 2, I don't have any 1s.\n\n334\n00:16:55.727 --> 00:17:03.140\n8 + 2 is 10, so I'm gonna guess that a\n1010 is a 10, which I know in hex Is an A.\n\n335\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.151\nAnd I would've guessed correctly, right?\n\n336\n00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:06.165\nSo you see how that's working?\n\n337\n00:17:06.165 --> 00:17:10.523\nWe're just converting that,\nso the 1111 becomes an F.\n\n338\n00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:14.887\n0010 becomes a 2, 1010 is an A.\n\n339\n00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:19.742\n0011, that's a 2, and\na 1, totaled up as a 3.\n\n340\n00:17:19.742 --> 00:17:24.972\nSo this number in binary can be\nrepresented by an F2A3 in hexadecimal,\n\n341\n00:17:24.972 --> 00:17:25.840\nall right?\n\n342\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.770\nSo that's how we're gonna convert.\n\n343\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.430\nAnd the same thing if I was\ngoing the opposite way.\n\n344\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.547\nAn F, if I had this, F2A3.\n\n345\n00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:39.390\nI would just take the first letter,\nan F, and I would say an F's a 1111.\n\n346\n00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.933\nAnd then a 2 is 0010.\n\n347\n00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:44.100\nAn A is 1010.\n\n348\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.360\nA 3 is 0011.\n\n349\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.950\nPlug all these back together,\nand I get this, right.\n\n350\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.120\nSo relatively easy to convert back and\nforth, just practice a little bit is\n\n351\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.850\nall I can say,\nbreak yourself out a little spreadsheet.\n\n352\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.610\nAlthough I will tell you Excel is probably\na little more difficult to work with this.\n\n353\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.077\nBecause it's not designed to\ntreat numbers as text, so\n\n354\n00:18:03.077 --> 00:18:07.078\nyou will have to format your sheet\na little bit to play with that.\n\n355\n00:18:07.078 --> 00:18:08.220\nAll right, so good enough.\n\n356\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.610\nWe've got our numbering systems down Pat.\n\n357\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.950\nLet's start by taking a look at what\nthe heck an IPv4 address is, right.\n\n358\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:21.256\nAn IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4,\nor IPv4 for short.\n\n359\n00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:23.943\nThis is the addressing\nscheme we've used really,\n\n360\n00:18:23.943 --> 00:18:26.500\nsince the dawn of computer networks.\n\n361\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.320\nSo it's been around for a long time.\n\n362\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.120\nAnd the way it works, an IPv4 address,\n\n363\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.160\nif we take a look at my screen,\nis a 32-bit binary number, right?\n\n364\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.760\nThat means I've got 32 ones and or\nzeros that make up an IPv4 address.\n\n365\n00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.700\nAnd that's what I have\nrepresented up here at the top.\n\n366\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.440\nThis is the an example of an IPv4 address.\n\n367\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.126\nBut that's kind of crazy, right?\n\n368\n00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:53.792\nYou're looking at that,\nhey Wes what's your IP address?\"\n\n369\n00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:57.900\n&gt;&gt; 110011101- I have no clue.\n\n370\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n371\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.075\nLet's type that into a properties dialog\nbox on our operating system, right?\n\n372\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:08.970\n1101001 wait, was that a 1 or a 0?\n\n373\n00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.485\nCrud, now let me start over.\n\n374\n00:19:10.485 --> 00:19:14.020\n110, yeah,\nno that's not gonna work, right?\n\n375\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.740\nComputers might be great with\nthat string of 1's and 0's.\n\n376\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.600\nHumans, not so much.\n\n377\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.670\nSo we're gonna do a bunch of things to\nmake it a lot easier for us to work with,\n\n378\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.520\nand we need to be able to recognize and\nwork with it.\n\n379\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.470\nSo the first thing we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna divide this thing up.\n\n380\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:33.650\n32 of anything is a lot, we're gonna\ndivide it up into chunks of 8 bits each.\n\n381\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.370\nThere's 32 bits total,\nso 32 divided by 8 is 4.\n\n382\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.800\nThat means I'm gonna\nget 4 chunks of 8 bits.\n\n383\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.632\n8 bits is actually a byte, so\nI've got 4 bytes, it's a 4 byte address.\n\n384\n00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:52.868\nRight, so I took this number\nright here and divided it up and\n\n385\n00:19:52.868 --> 00:19:57.940\nI separated those eight bits with\na period, or a decimal point.\n\n386\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.475\nThis is known as the dotted\ndecimal notation.\n\n387\n00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:02.555\nAnd it's how we write our IP addresses.\n\n388\n00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:04.405\nBut we still don't do it this way,\ndo we Wes?\n\n389\n00:20:04.405 --> 00:20:05.325\n&gt;&gt; No I don't think so.\n\n390\n00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:09.655\nI think we have to make it a little bit\nmore discernible for us humans here.\n\n391\n00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:10.505\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n392\n00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:12.445\n&gt;&gt; Didn't help me much but thank you.\n\n393\n00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:13.335\n&gt;&gt; I tried.\n\n394\n00:20:13.335 --> 00:20:14.615\nAll right, so let's do that.\n\n395\n00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:15.335\nAnd what are we gonna do?\n\n396\n00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:20.375\nWe're gonna use what we just learned and\nconvert this into decimal, right.\n\n397\n00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:23.305\nSo I've got eight bits here,\nI know my place values.\n\n398\n00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:29.750\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, right,\nso we would just add them up.\n\n399\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.690\nI've got a 128 turned on,\nI've got a 64 turned on,\n\n400\n00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.270\nthere's no 32's, no 16's, no 8's,\nno 4's, no 2's, no 1's, so that's it.\n\n401\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.130\n128 and 64 is 192, all right.\n\n402\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.990\nSo we're just gonna put a 192.\n\n403\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.210\nLet's clear that out.\n\n404\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.153\nExcel's not playing along with me.\n\n405\n00:20:49.153 --> 00:20:51.160\nWe'll call that 192.\n\n406\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.222\nAnd let's do this.\n\n407\n00:20:52.222 --> 00:20:55.605\nWe're gonna make everything\na little bit bigger, so\n\n408\n00:20:55.605 --> 00:20:58.548\nMike's tired old eyes\ncan actually see this.\n\n409\n00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:02.959\nAll right, so\nthose 8 bits convert to a 192.\n\n410\n00:21:02.959 --> 00:21:05.226\nAnd then we just move\non to the next one and\n\n411\n00:21:05.226 --> 00:21:07.840\nwe completely ignore the one we just did.\n\n412\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.000\nWe start all over, this is 0,\nthis is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.\n\n413\n00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.920\nThe other stuff on either side,\nwe completely ignore.\n\n414\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.240\nWe focus on one octet at a time.\n\n415\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.636\nAnd that's what it's known as is an octet,\nbecause it's 8 bits.\n\n416\n00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:25.538\nAll right, so there's a 128, no 64s,\n\n417\n00:21:25.538 --> 00:21:30.573\nI do have a 32, so 128 and 32 is 160.\n\n418\n00:21:30.573 --> 00:21:36.202\nThere's no 16s but there is an 8,\nso 160 + 8 is 168.\n\n419\n00:21:36.202 --> 00:21:41.197\nNo 4s, no 2s, no 1s,\nso that must be a 168.\n\n420\n00:21:41.197 --> 00:21:42.855\nAll right, can I cheat and\nhelp with the next one?\n\n421\n00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:44.862\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Because I remember your hexidecimal\n\n422\n00:21:44.862 --> 00:21:47.638\nrepresentation, so I'm gonna go,\nhm, I think that's a 10.\n\n423\n00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:50.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a 10, very good.\n\n424\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.954\nIt's an 8 and a 2, which would be a 10.\n\n425\n00:21:52.954 --> 00:21:54.530\nAnd then the last one, Wes?\n\n426\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.090\n&gt;&gt; That is, what?\n\n427\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.900\nThat is a 1 in the ones place,\nno 2's, that's a 5.\n\n428\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.400\n&gt;&gt; That is a 5.\n\n429\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.020\nAll right?\n\n430\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.150\nMy chance to throw in my favorite\nbinary joke, well one of them.\n\n431\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.630\nIt's sad that I probably have\nmore than one binary joke.\n\n432\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.001\nBut what's a binary high five?\n\n433\n00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:11.527\nOkay?\n\n434\n00:22:11.527 --> 00:22:12.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 1, 0, 1.\n\n435\n00:22:12.543 --> 00:22:14.260\nThat's a high five.\n\n436\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.430\nYeah, lame, I know.\n\n437\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.900\nAll right, but anyway, moving on.\n\n438\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.120\nThis is why they don't\npay me to write jokes.\n\n439\n00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.110\nSo now we can see that this number.\n\n440\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.050\nAgain I'd have my decimal points in there.\n\n441\n00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.131\nSo I have a period there,\nperiod there, period there.\n\n442\n00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:31.015\nAnd if I wanted to write\nit out like a human,\n\n443\n00:22:31.015 --> 00:22:33.695\nlet me just find a scratchy place here.\n\n444\n00:22:33.695 --> 00:22:40.860\n192.168.10.5, all right.\n\n445\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.170\nSo there's my IP address.\n\n446\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.620\nThat, at least to me,\n\n447\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.240\nyou guys tell me, is a lot easier\nthan working with that, right?\n\n448\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.800\nSame exact number.\n\n449\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.240\nIt's the same exact number.\n\n450\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.820\nIt's just a different\nrepresentation of the number.\n\n451\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.280\nSo that's an IPv4 address.\n\n452\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.100\nNeed to be able to recognize that.\n\n453\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.410\nIf you're studying for this exam,\n\n454\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.530\nhopefully you've done\na little bit of this.\n\n455\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.530\nAnd you recognize an IPv4 address.\n\n456\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.580\nA couple other things I wanna point out\nbefore we move on into what a subnet\n\n457\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.730\nmask is.\n\n458\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:15.260\nAnd that is, that if you take eight bits,\nwhat is the biggest number you can write?\n\n459\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.740\nWhat do you think, Wes?\n\n460\n00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.310\n&gt;&gt; My thought is you fill every\nsingle place value up with a one.\n\n461\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.121\nAnd if I had to add that up,\nI'm gonna cheat here and\n\n462\n00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:28.056\nI'm gonna say it's probably 255.\n\n463\n00:23:28.056 --> 00:23:28.586\nMy thought.\n\n464\n00:23:28.586 --> 00:23:29.853\n&gt;&gt; 255 would be the answer, right?\n\n465\n00:23:29.853 --> 00:23:32.234\nWonder if you just add them up,\n\n466\n00:23:32.234 --> 00:23:37.831\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1,\n255 is the number.\n\n467\n00:23:37.831 --> 00:23:41.872\nSo all 1's, if all eight bits\nare turned on It's a 255 and\n\n468\n00:23:41.872 --> 00:23:44.611\nI cannot go any higher than that, right.\n\n469\n00:23:44.611 --> 00:23:48.060\nThere's no more bits, a 0 and\na 1 are the only allowed values.\n\n470\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.680\nI can't put a 2 in there and double up\non the 8's or anything like that, right.\n\n471\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.300\n255 is the biggest number I can make.\n\n472\n00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.290\n&gt;&gt; So, in any exam, whether we're talking\nabout GSEC, we're talking about any exam.\n\n473\n00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.030\nIf they tell me, they give me all 1s, and\nthey say, what is this binary number?\n\n474\n00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.380\nAnd I see anything over 255,\n\n475\n00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.070\nI can just scratch that off\nas being the right answer.\n\n476\n00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.610\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n477\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.865\nIf you're talking about 8 bits.\n\n478\n00:24:06.865 --> 00:24:09.570\nIf you're talking about an IPv4 address,\nabsolutely.\n\n479\n00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.346\nObviously we can write bigger numbers\nout with binary, but not with 8 bits,\n\n480\n00:24:13.346 --> 00:24:13.950\nall right.\n\n481\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.240\nYou see this all the time in computers.\n\n482\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.630\nWhen you talk about an older system\nthat can only do 256 colors.\n\n483\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.540\nWhy?\n\n484\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.420\nBecause it only had 8 bits to store\na value to represent the color.\n\n485\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.400\nSo there's 256 unique values,\nif you count the zero, right?\n\n486\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.750\nAll zeros, all the way up to all ones.\n\n487\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.530\nYou can't have any more colors, than that.\n\n488\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.610\nUnless you went to a 16-bit system, right?\n\n489\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.240\nRemember when our game systems\nmoved up from 8 bit to 16 bits.\n\n490\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.916\nThink, we went from 255 possible colors,\nor 256, to 65,535 possible colors.\n\n491\n00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:49.230\nIt was huge, man,\nall of sudden my games were great.\n\n492\n00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.880\nSo you'll see these numbers pop up all\nover the place once you get into the world\n\n493\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.770\nof computers.\n\n494\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.095\nAnd it all comes back to bytes and\nbits and then ones and zeros.\n\n495\n00:24:58.095 --> 00:24:59.760\nIt's a great system.\n\n496\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.160\nAll right, so that's our IPv4 address.\n\n497\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.590\nNow, we said 255 is the biggest number.\n\n498\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:12.270\nSo if we wanted to look at it one way,\nyou could say IPv4 addresses\n\n499\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:19.212\ncan range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255,\nright?\n\n500\n00:25:19.212 --> 00:25:23.600\nI mean, technically, that is\nthe maximum range of IPv4 addresses.\n\n501\n00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.350\nThere's a lot of stuff that's not used or\ncan't be used and rules, but just in\n\n502\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:34.080\na very strict sense, possibilities, you\ncan go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.\n\n503\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.453\nWhich, you know that number, I'm sure.\n\n504\n00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:37.611\n&gt;&gt; What the 255.255?\n\n505\n00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:40.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many possible\nnumbers is that all together?\n\n506\n00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:44.920\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna catch me on this one,\n4.294 billion and change.\n\n507\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.920\n&gt;&gt; You got the 4 right,\nthat's all I care about.\n\n508\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's 4.3 billion.\n\n509\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.071\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, it's 4.3 billion\naddresses or 4.2 something,\n\n510\n00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:52.600\nsomething possible addresses.\n\n511\n00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.070\nYou can figure it out by doing.\n\n512\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.270\nWell here, you know what, Wes.\n\n513\n00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.260\nI have Excel in front of me.\n\n514\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.711\nEquals, we'll do 2 to the power of 32.\n\n515\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.585\nAnd we get 4,294,967,296\npossible addresses.\n\n516\n00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:10.054\n&gt;&gt; That was close when\nit comes to ItProTV.\n\n517\n00:26:10.054 --> 00:26:10.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, give or take a million.\n\n518\n00:26:10.904 --> 00:26:12.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you were off by\na hundred thousand or so.\n\n519\n00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:15.318\nI think we can accept that,\nright guys and girls?\n\n520\n00:26:15.318 --> 00:26:19.756\nAll right, anywho, now when we work\nwith these numbering systems the IANA,\n\n521\n00:26:19.756 --> 00:26:23.470\nWes help me with this one,\nI always blank out on this one.\n\n522\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:28.450\n&gt;&gt; It's IANA, that is I-A-N-A,\nInternet Assigned Numbering Authority.\n\n523\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.\n\n524\n00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.650\nWhen they developed this system, right,\nthey tried to put in a system in place\n\n525\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.510\nthat would help us use these numbers,\nassign these numbers cuz\n\n526\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.240\nthis is an organization, I needed\nan IP addresses for all of my systems.\n\n527\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.290\nSo what numbers you gonna give me?\n\n528\n00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.816\nWell I'm just gonna give you a random,\nor you can have 1124 and 37,\n\n529\n00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:50.444\n42, 55, 128 and 192, right.\n\n530\n00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:52.660\nSo we had to have a way to assign these.\n\n531\n00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.230\nYes, Wes.\n\n532\n00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.420\n&gt;&gt; And that's really,\nif I wanna make a phone call,\n\n533\n00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.840\nright, I go out and I buy a cellphone.\n\n534\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.260\nI don't just randomly pick a slew of\nnumbers and apply it to the phone and\n\n535\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.922\nsay, now you're gonna call me, Mike.\n\n536\n00:27:02.922 --> 00:27:05.180\nIt's gonna be 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\n537\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.880\nThere's gotta be some structure.\n\n538\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.740\nSo essentially I get my number from\n\n539\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.750\nsome kind of body that's\nauthorized to give that.\n\n540\n00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.870\nSo not much difference here.\n\n541\n00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:13.890\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n542\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:19.740\nSo what the IANA did was they divided\nthat pool of numbers from 0 to 255,\n\n543\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.520\nall the way through, into classes.\n\n544\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.670\nClass A through class E.\n\n545\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.390\nSo, we've got five classes,\nA, B, C, D, and E.\n\n546\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.090\nThe first three classes\nare classes that we use for\n\n547\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.780\naddressing nodes on our networks class A,\nclass B, class C.\n\n548\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.690\nClass D is a reserve range.\n\n549\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.400\nSort of, it's set aside from multicast.\n\n550\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.200\nWe still use it to assign\naddresses to nodes, but above and\n\n551\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.372\nbeyond they're IP address\nthat they already have.\n\n552\n00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:51.170\nAnd multicast address is, if you want\nto take part in a video conference or\n\n553\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.740\nsomething like that.\n\n554\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.310\nSo there's a range of addresses\nset aside for that class D.\n\n555\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.500\nAnd then class E is experimental,\nit's a reserved class,\n\n556\n00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.480\nI call it experimental,\nsince E, kinda, right.\n\n557\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.689\nIt makes it easy to remember,\nbut those are reserved just for\n\n558\n00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:10.983\nexperimentation and testing and things\nlike that with an IANA and the IETF.\n\n559\n00:28:10.983 --> 00:28:14.130\nSo we're not allowed to use those either,\nall right.\n\n560\n00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.910\nSo what we need to be able to do is one,\nrecognize what class an IP address is\n\n561\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.830\nbecause we haven't learned\nabout subnet masks yet, but\n\n562\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.110\nthere are default subnet masks\nthat go with the classes.\n\n563\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.150\nSo you need to be able to recognize\nwhat class an IP address is in.\n\n564\n00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Now one of the things I noticed Mike\nabout these classes is that you only have\n\n565\n00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:38.070\na single octet or a single eight\nbits out of four of those chunks.\n\n566\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.950\nWhy is that?\n\n567\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Because when we're dealing with just\ntrying to determine what class the IP\n\n568\n00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.690\naddress is from, then all we need\nto look at is the first eight bits.\n\n569\n00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.130\nThe others are inconsequential.\n\n570\n00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.780\nSo what we're trying to determine here,\nall right?\n\n571\n00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.670\nSo if we take those first eight bits.\n\n572\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:57.460\nIf the very first bit is a zero,\nthen it's a class A, all right?\n\n573\n00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.220\nNotice none of the others\nhave a 0 in the first bit.\n\n574\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.880\nSo if the first bit is a 0,\nit is a class A.\n\n575\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.900\nAnd the first address is 00000001.\n\n576\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.604\nAll right, the last one would be 01111111.\n\n577\n00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:15.610\nSo we could convert that back to decimal.\n\n578\n00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.260\nAnd Wes, that's gonna go from 1 to\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you,\n\n579\n00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.470\nyou're challenging my math guys out there.\n\n580\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.290\nLet's try this one.\n\n581\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.090\nI'm gonna guess and say it's 127.\n\n582\n00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.232\n&gt;&gt; It is 127.\nNow I'm gonna\n\n583\n00:29:24.232 --> 00:29:28.321\nshow you a real quick cheat that doesn't\nhave anything to do with your exam, but\n\n584\n00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:31.189\nif all the bits are turned on and\nthe last one here is a 0,\n\n585\n00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:34.021\nit's gonna be one step down\nfrom whatever this bit is.\n\n586\n00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:36.980\nSo this is 128,\nthat means all the rest again,\n\n587\n00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.520\nthat's probably just gonna\nconfuse us at this point.\n\n588\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.090\nThere is lots of cool little shortcuts you\ncan learn with binary once you understand\n\n589\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.651\nthe basics.\n\n590\n00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:48.381\nSo, let me just back off the shortcuts,\nlearn it the right way,\n\n591\n00:29:48.381 --> 00:29:50.060\nthen learn your shortcuts.\n\n592\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.946\nSo 127 you would be correct,\nadd all those up.\n\n593\n00:29:51.946 --> 00:29:55.866\n6432168421 is 127.\n\n594\n00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:59.400\nAll right, class B,\nwe're gonna look at the first two bits.\n\n595\n00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.750\nThe first bit's a 1, but\nthe second bit's going to be a 0.\n\n596\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.250\nNotice none of the others\nhave a 0 in that second bit.\n\n597\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:13.690\nSo if the first bit's a 1, but the second\nbit's a 0, it has to be a class B address.\n\n598\n00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.898\nAnd if we convert that first number back\ninto decimal, what do we get there, Wes?\n\n599\n00:30:17.898 --> 00:30:19.457\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe're gonna try it again, 128.\n\n600\n00:30:19.457 --> 00:30:20.251\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n601\n00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:23.770\n&gt;&gt; And then I would say\nthe second one is gonna be 191.\n\n602\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.300\n&gt;&gt; 191, you would be correct, sir.\n\n603\n00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.390\nAll right, and then class C,\nthe first two bits are 1.\n\n604\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.120\nThe third bit is a 0.\n\n605\n00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.700\nAgain, notice that none of\nthe others go 1 1 0, right?\n\n606\n00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.390\nSo if it has a 1 1 0 at\nthe beginning of the first octet,\n\n607\n00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.380\nit has to be a class C address.\n\n608\n00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.379\nAnd that goes from what?\n\n609\n00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:46.238\n&gt;&gt; 192 to 223, I believe.\n\n610\n00:30:46.238 --> 00:30:47.853\nSo 192 to 223.\n\n611\n00:30:47.853 --> 00:30:49.798\n&gt;&gt; 223, exactly.\n\n612\n00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:52.140\nAnd then just for giggles,\nwe'll fill these out.\n\n613\n00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.746\nWhat was that one?\n\n614\n00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:55.517\n&gt;&gt; That's 224, I believe it's to 240.\n\n615\n00:30:55.517 --> 00:31:00.898\nAnd the E, or experimental range like you\ncall it, is the 241 to 255 cuz like Mike\n\n616\n00:31:00.898 --> 00:31:06.451\nsaid earlier, we got 1s at every single\nplace, highest value, it's gotta be 255.\n\n617\n00:31:06.451 --> 00:31:09.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and again, I'm not so\nworried about these.\n\n618\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.100\nIt's really these three that you need\nto be able to recognize right away.\n\n619\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.020\nAnd honestly,\n\n620\n00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.900\nwe rarely break it back from decimal\nto binary to figure this out, right?\n\n621\n00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.436\nYou look at the first number and if\nit's a 140, well it's in between 128 and\n\n622\n00:31:23.436 --> 00:31:26.018\n191, it's a class B address, all right.\n\n623\n00:31:26.018 --> 00:31:31.020\nIf it's 197, well, that's in between here,\nthat's a class C address, right?\n\n624\n00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.660\nSo as long as you know where\nreach range starts and stops.\n\n625\n00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:38.560\nThis is so you can figure out\nwhere each range starts and stops.\n\n626\n00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.083\nBut once you do, you've memorized\nthis part and you're good to go,\n\n627\n00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:43.986\nthat's really all you need to have.\n\n628\n00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:46.250\nAll right, so we got this classful system.\n\n629\n00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:52.383\nAnd then along with that class came\na default subnet mask, all right.\n\n630\n00:31:52.383 --> 00:31:54.695\nAnd let's see if I got it.\n\n631\n00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:55.320\nThere it is right there.\n\n632\n00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.730\nWith class A, well actually,\nI take that back.\n\n633\n00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.470\nYou know what?\n\n634\n00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.500\nWe didn't even talk about what\nthe heck a subnet mask is first.\n\n635\n00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.740\nSo we need to do that.\n\n636\n00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.840\nBut Wes I know, Wes is giving\nme the hand signals over here.\n\n637\n00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.750\nI think we're a little short on time.\n\n638\n00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:08.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n639\n00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.150\nWe are pushing the envelope and flexing\nthe muscles on the clock out there.\n\n640\n00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:11.940\nBut we've got so\n\n641\n00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.720\nmuch great, more fundamental information\nthat you really need to know and\n\n642\n00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.120\nyou gotta get under your belt if you're\ngonna be in any networking environment.\n\n643\n00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.430\nAnd if you're gonna deal with computers,\n\n644\n00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.220\nif you don't know, you don't understand\nnetworking, chances are the only thing\n\n645\n00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.350\nyou're gonna do is deliver the computer\nand somebody is gonna sign off for it.\n\n646\n00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.170\nSo we've got a lot more to come but Mike,\nlooks like we're gonna have to go into\n\n647\n00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.260\na part four here, so\nwhat do you say we go ahead.\n\n648\n00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.050\nWe'll wrap this one up and then we'll\ncome back and we'll do a part four.\n\n649\n00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n650\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Mike, as always we\nappreciate having you in the studios.\n\n651\n00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.000\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching out there.\n\n652\n00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.300\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n653\n00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n654\n00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.192\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n655\n00:32:47.192 --> 00:32:53.236\n[MUSIC]\n\n656\n00:32:53.236 -->

00:00:11.840\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.565\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:15.875\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.507\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our GIAC Security Fundamentals,\n\n7\n00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:20.701\nand we've been looking at,\n\n8\n00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.106\nwell, networking fundamentals\nthe past few episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.401\nAnd there's a lot of information you need\nto get under your belt if you're gonna be\n\n10\n00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.520\ntackling this exam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.455\nSo to help clarify some of these subjects\nis none other than Mr Mike Roderick.\n\n12\n00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:31.489\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.000\nAnd yeah, we got a little bit more to do\nwhen it comes to network fundamentals.\n\n15\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.730\nSo we left off in the previous episode,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n16\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.970\nwatch those, right?\n\n17\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.180\nWe left off in that previous episode,\nwe learned about the IPv4 address itself.\n\n18\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.380\nWe'd looked at the different classes,\nthe way it was divided up by the IANA,\n\n19\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.170\nwe learned how to recognize a Class A,\na Class B, a Class C address.\n\n20\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.750\nNext thing we're gonna talk about is\nsomething known as a subnet mask.\n\n21\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.330\nBecause an IPv4 address on its\nown is actually useless, right?\n\n22\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.470\nWe need something known as a subnet\nmask to go with that IPv4 address\n\n23\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.120\nbecause an IPv4 address represents\ntwo things, not just one, right?\n\n24\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.030\nWe said it was an address for your node or\nfor your device, but in that address,\n\n25\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.240\nthere's actually two parts to it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.045\nPart of it represents the network\nyou're on, so the network ID.\n\n27\n00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:29.414\nPart of that address represents the node,\nor we could call it the host ID, but\n\n28\n00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:32.306\nremember, I mean,\nanything that has IP address,\n\n29\n00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:36.705\nright, a phone, a tablet, a PC,\na router, anything that gets an address.\n\n30\n00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:39.124\nSo, part of the address\nrepresents the network.\n\n31\n00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:41.672\nPart of the address represents the node,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:44.966\nwe've gotta be able to figure\nout where that division is.\n\n33\n00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:48.081\nHow do I know which numbers\nrepresent the network portion and\n\n34\n00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.765\nwhich numbers represent the node portion?\n\n35\n00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:54.240\nAnd before we go into how we can do that,\nlet's talk about the why.\n\n36\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.780\nWhen we look at an address,\nI always use a mail analogy.\n\n37\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.263\nIf we look at the houses on my street,\n\n38\n00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:04.723\neverybody on my street\nshares part of the address.\n\n39\n00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:09.300\nMy address is 3925 Northwest 62nd Avenue.\n\n40\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.330\nThe guy on the next to me is\nalso Northwest 62nd Avenue.\n\n41\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.460\nThe guy across the street\nfrom me is Northwest 62nd,\n\n42\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.390\nthe guy on the other side of\nme is Northwest 62nd, right?\n\n43\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.200\nWe all share the same street part.\n\n44\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.220\nBut we each have a unique number.\n\n45\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.450\nMy house is 3925.\n\n46\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.880\nThe guy next to me is 3923.\n\n47\n00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.234\nThe other side is 3927, right?\n\n48\n00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:35.918\nSo part of my address represents my\nnetwork if you will, right, my street.\n\n49\n00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:40.739\nThe other part of the address represents\nmy individual house on that street,\n\n50\n00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.010\nall right?\n\n51\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.630\nAnd that part has to be unique.\n\n52\n00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.350\nIf there were two 3925\nNorthwest 62nd Avenue,\n\n53\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.242\nhow could the postman, or post woman, or\n\n54\n00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:55.136\npost person deliver an address or\ndeliver a piece of mail to 3925?\n\n55\n00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:58.470\nThere's two houses that\nare 3925 Northwest 62nd.\n\n56\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.630\nThat wouldn't work.\n\n57\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.290\nIt's the same thing in IPs.\n\n58\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.085\nAll the computers that are on the same\nnetwork have the same network portion of\n\n59\n00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.500\ntheir IPv4 address.\n\n60\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.119\nBut the node portion has to be unique, so\n\n61\n00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.930\nthat I can uniquely identify each\nindividual node on that network.\n\n62\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.780\nGo to a different network, they're gonna\nhave a different network address and\n\n63\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.100\nthen each node on that network\nwould have a unique one.\n\n64\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.050\nAnd those unique parts is where\nit gets a little confusing\n\n65\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.240\ncan be reused on a different network.\n\n66\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.410\nI said there could not be two 3925\nNorthwest 62nd Avenues, right,\n\n67\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.770\nbecause that wouldn't work.\n\n68\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.940\nCould there be a 3925\nNorthwest 61st Avenue?\n\n69\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.060\nDifferent street,\nI can reuse the house number.\n\n70\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.180\nDifferent network,\nI can reuse the node portion, right?\n\n71\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.080\nSo when we talk about\na particular network,\n\n72\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080\nthe node portion has to be unique.\n\n73\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.604\nBut those node portions can be reused\non a different network, cuz overall,\n\n74\n00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:56.264\nthe address would still be unique.\n\n75\n00:03:56.264 --> 00:04:03.240\n3925 Northwest 62nd Avenue, 3925 Northwest\n61st Avenue, those are still unique.\n\n76\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.030\nI can still deliver mail to one or\nthe other, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.230\nSo that's my quick little analogy.\n\n78\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.740\nNow the question is,\nhow do we divide that address?\n\n79\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.435\nHow do we figure out what is the network\nportion and what is the node portion?\n\n80\n00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:16.875\nWe used subnet masks.\n\n81\n00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:22.755\nSubnet masks are binary strings\nthat help us divide that number.\n\n82\n00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:27.913\nAnd the way it works is a subnet mask,\nstarting from the left, all right,\n\n83\n00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:32.895\nis gonna be 1s, until you get to\nthe first 0, wherever that might be.\n\n84\n00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.030\nI'm not telling you how many 1s there are.\n\n85\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.290\nBut at some point,\nthis string of 1s is gonna turn to 0s, and\n\n86\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.550\nit'll be 0s from the rest of the way.\n\n87\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.700\nThat is a rule of subnet masks,\nthe 1s are contiguous.\n\n88\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.660\n1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, from that point,\nthere cannot be anymore 1s.\n\n89\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.850\nIt has to be 0s for the rest of the way.\n\n90\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.847\nSo if the first eight bits are 1,\nand then the ninth bit is a 0,\n\n91\n00:04:55.847 --> 00:04:59.481\nthe rest of them,\nthe next 23 bits are all gonna be 0s.\n\n92\n00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:02.771\nYou can never have another 1\nafter a 0 in subnet masks,\n\n93\n00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:06.250\nnot talking about IP addresses,\nin the subnet mask.\n\n94\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.260\nSo just remember, 1s when you get to\nthe first 0, 0s the rest of the way.\n\n95\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.330\nNow there are some default masks\nthat go along with those classes\n\n96\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.360\nwe just learned about.\n\n97\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.610\nAnd let's take a look at my screen here,\nso we can see what they are.\n\n98\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.766\nThis is a subnet mask, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:28.364\nIt's written in decimal like this,\n255.000.\n\n100\n00:05:28.364 --> 00:05:32.500\nIn binary, well, the 255 is all 1s.\n\n101\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.970\nAnd then the next set is a 0,\nwhich is all 0s.\n\n102\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.710\nAnd notice, once they're 0s,\nthere will never be anymore 1s.\n\n103\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.612\nSo with the Class A,\nthe default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0,\n\n104\n00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:47.030\neight 1s, 24 0s, all right.\n\n105\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.260\nThe line that divides\nthe network portion and\n\n106\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.950\nthe node portion is where\nthe 1s turn into 0s.\n\n107\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.820\nSo in that case, it's right here.\n\n108\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.750\nAnything to the left of that line is\ngonna represent the network portion.\n\n109\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.580\nAnything to the right is\ngonna represent the node.\n\n110\n00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.113\nAnd I'll show you how we\ncalculate it in just a minute, but\n\n111\n00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:13.990\nlet's go through the rest of\nthe default subnet masks.\n\n112\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.334\nFor a Class B, it's 255.255.0.0,\n\n113\n00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:23.340\nso all 1s, all 1s, 0s, 0s.\n\n114\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.305\nThe line would be drawn right here,\nwhere the 1s change to 0s,\n\n115\n00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:30.905\nthat's that dividing line\nbetween left side is network,\n\n116\n00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:34.145\nright side of that line is gonna be node,\nall right?\n\n117\n00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:37.824\nAlthough that's probably backwards on\nthe camera, but you know what I'm saying.\n\n118\n00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:41.837\nAnd then Class C is 255.255.255.0.\n\n119\n00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:46.072\nSo all 1s, all 1s, all 1s, and\nthen the last one is all 0s, so\n\n120\n00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.730\nthat gets divided right there, all right.\n\n121\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.890\nSo that means if somebody\ngives you a Class A address,\n\n122\n00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.315\nif we're using our default system,\nif they give me a Class A address,\n\n123\n00:06:56.315 --> 00:07:00.940\nthey don't have to tell me the subnet\nmask, I know that it's 255.000.\n\n124\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.891\nIf they give me a Class C address,\n\n125\n00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:07.930\nI know that the subnet mask\nis 255.255.255.0, all right?\n\n126\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.164\nBut we need to be able to\ncalculate this out because\n\n127\n00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.320\nit's gonna get a little tricky.\n\n128\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.942\nWell, let's see how I can do this,\nlet's just take an address here.\n\n129\n00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:24.472\nWe'll do 192.168.10,\n\n130\n00:07:24.472 --> 00:07:29.494\nand did it a third time.\n\n131\n00:07:29.494 --> 00:07:32.378\nThere's none left,\nI can't do it one more time, .54.\n\n132\n00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:38.733\nAll right, now,\nthe default subnet mask is 255.255.255,\n\n133\n00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:42.808\nI just left the periods out that time,\nright?\n\n134\n00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:43.780\nDid you see that?\n\n135\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.484\n0, right?\n\n136\n00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:51.510\nWell I said where the 1s end and\nthe 0s begin, that's the dividing line.\n\n137\n00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.116\nSo there we go, that means\nthe network portion is 192.168.10.\n\n138\n00:07:56.116 --> 00:08:02.359\nThe node portion is 54, cuz this is\nwhere the 1s end and the 0s begin.\n\n139\n00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:06.976\nNow if they ask you what is the network\nID, well, we know where the line is\n\n140\n00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:11.370\ndivided, we know that it's\nanything on the left of that line.\n\n141\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.340\nBut when we write it out,\nwe still have to include all four octets.\n\n142\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.326\nSo the 192 was on the network side,\nthe 168 was on the network side.\n\n143\n00:08:20.326 --> 00:08:22.023\nThe 10 was on the network side,\n\n144\n00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:25.840\n54's on the node side, so\nthat's not part of my network address.\n\n145\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.540\nSo I just put a 0 to represent that\nlast block because it's not part, right?\n\n146\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.346\nIt was on the other side of that line.\n\n147\n00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:37.380\nSo there is my network address,\n192.168.10.0, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.840\nAll nodes that are on that network\nare gonna share this part of the address.\n\n149\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.793\nSo I might have another system 192.168,\n\n150\n00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:52.533\noops, see if I can make this line up,\n\n151\n00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:57.024\n1,6 can't type today, 10.154.\n\n152\n00:08:57.024 --> 00:08:59.136\nOpp, I already used 54,\nlet's do something different.\n\n153\n00:08:59.136 --> 00:08:59.710\n32, all right?\n\n154\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.000\nAgain, same subnet mask is gonna apply,\nso the dividing line is right here.\n\n155\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.401\nNotice how they're both on the same,\nlet's color that,\n\n156\n00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:11.955\nlet's put this dividing line in so\nwe can see it permanently.\n\n157\n00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:15.890\nAll right.\n\n158\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.399\nSo notice how both of these computers\nshare the same network address\n\n159\n00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:23.890\n192.168.10, 192.168.10.\n\n160\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.760\nNotice how their host number,\nor node ID, is different.\n\n161\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.680\nOne's 54, one is 132, all right.\n\n162\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.670\nBut they're one the same network,\n\n163\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.630\nand that's what you need\nto be able to figure out.\n\n164\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.950\nAre these two devices on\nthe same network or not?\n\n165\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.830\nAnd we simply do it by simply using\nthe subnet mask to divide the address.\n\n166\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.800\nAnd with the Classful system,\nit's extremely easy.\n\n167\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.320\nWith a class A, the first octet is\ngoing to be part of the network.\n\n168\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.450\nThe last three are part of the node,\nright.\n\n169\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.410\nWe could draw a line here.\n\n170\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.010\nLet's just do that.\n\n171\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.470\nWe'll draw a line right there.\n\n172\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.373\nOn a Class B, it's gonna be right here.\n\n173\n00:10:04.373 --> 00:10:07.911\nAnd on a Class C,\nit's gonna be right here.\n\n174\n00:10:10.447 --> 00:10:14.200\nAll right, oops, somehow that did\nnot do what I wanted it to do.\n\n175\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.760\nLet's change that back to black and\ngray, there we go.\n\n176\n00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.201\nSo you can see where\nthose dividing lines are.\n\n177\n00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:25.868\nSo if somebody gives you, how easy\nis that, if they give me 10.1.25.45.\n\n178\n00:10:25.868 --> 00:10:28.180\nAll right, what is the network ID?\n\n179\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.670\nWell if it's a classful system, only\nthe first octet is part of the network.\n\n180\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.600\nEverything else is part of the node.\n\n181\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.700\nSo the network ID is 10.0.0.0, right.\n\n182\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.540\nThe first octet is the only one\nthat's part of the network address.\n\n183\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.890\nThat makes sense, I think.\n\n184\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.710\nSeems easy, right?\n\n185\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.130\nAnd it is, here.\n\n186\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.650\nBut here's the downside of it all.\n\n187\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:56.090\nThe whole classical system, yeah,\nit went out the window around 1995 or so.\n\n188\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.540\nIt's been a little while.\n\n189\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.450\nWe still teach it because\nit's still out there.\n\n190\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.450\nIt's still used in a way but\nhonestly we've gone to something new which\n\n191\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.475\nis known as classful\ninterdomain routing or CIDR for\n\n192\n00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:13.160\nshort, CIDR.\n\n193\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.560\nThe class list says we're not\ngonna do classes anymore.\n\n194\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.210\nWe're gonna do away with that.\n\n195\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.870\nThe problem was, I'll give you\na little history on IP real quick,\n\n196\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.280\na brief history,\nis this system was not very scalable.\n\n197\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.090\nBecause here's what happens, if all of\nthese octets are for my network Id.\n\n198\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.060\nThen only this last octet is for\nmy node Id.\n\n199\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.620\nHow many possible node\nIds can I come up with?\n\n200\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.990\nHow many unique numbers can\nI create with eight bits?\n\n201\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.070\nThe smallest one is 0, the biggest\none is 255, so what does that leave?\n\n202\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.700\nOr how many numbers is that?\n\n203\n00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.690\n&gt;&gt; I believe that's 254,\n256 total possible.\n\n204\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.650\n&gt;&gt; 256 and then there's some rules\nthat say you can't use 0 for a host.\n\n205\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.240\nYou also can't use 255 for a host, so\nwe have to take two of those away.\n\n206\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.710\nWe're left with 254, so I can only have\n254 nodes on that Class C network.\n\n207\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.550\nI run out of numbers.\n\n208\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:12.290\nThere's no more unique numbers to\nassign the 255th, 56th, 57th hosts.\n\n209\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.466\nCan't do it.\n\n210\n00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:16.760\nAll right, so\nas an organization if I go to the IANA and\n\n211\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.389\nI say I need some IP addresses, they're\ngonna say would you like a class C.\n\n212\n00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:26.810\nI have 375 hosts, a class C is not gonna\nwork, can we move up to the next one?\n\n213\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.610\nSure we can give you a class B.\n\n214\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.400\nHow many hosts can I have on a class B?\n\n215\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.900\nWell now I have 16 bits representing the\nnetwork, 16 bits representing the node.\n\n216\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.585\nWes, guesses on how much that is?\n\n217\n00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:43.774\n&gt;&gt; 65,350.\n\n218\n00:12:43.774 --> 00:12:46.774\n&gt;&gt; 500 and-\n&gt;&gt; Wait a second, 65,534, I believe\n\n219\n00:12:46.774 --> 00:12:49.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, right around there, 436.\n\n220\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.130\nBut yeah, 65,500 and some odd hosts.\n\n221\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.429\nI only had 300 and\nsomething hosts on my network.\n\n222\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.135\nThe class C was too small\nby about a hundred, so\n\n223\n00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:03.690\nthey gave me a class B which is 65,535.\n\n224\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.591\nI'm using 300 and something,\nthat means the other 65,200,\n\n225\n00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:10.451\nour mind but I'm not using them,\nthey're wasted,\n\n226\n00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:13.909\nnobody else can use them because\nthey've been assigned to me.\n\n227\n00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:17.689\nI'm never gonna have 65,000 hosts but\nthey're all my addresses and\n\n228\n00:13:17.689 --> 00:13:19.620\nyou can't have them, all right.\n\n229\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.730\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, that's very selfish of you\nman and so I can only imagine that this is\n\n230\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.800\na very wasteful system that we\nhad because at the time I mean,\n\n231\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.920\nwell there weren't many.\n\n232\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.241\nThere weren't even, maybe, what,\n\n233\n00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.401\nfive companies on the backbone\nof the Internet to begin with.\n\n234\n00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.870\nSo we're probably gonna\nneed another method, right?\n\n235\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n236\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.720\nAnd they saw it coming a long time ago.\n\n237\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.260\nThis was back in the early 90s.\n\n238\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.506\n93, I think, is when the first RFC,\n\n239\n00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:43.810\nor one of the first RFCs,\ncame out about addressing this problem.\n\n240\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.970\nNo pun intended,\nin dealing with our shortage of addresses.\n\n241\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.493\nBecause companies were getting a class\nB address even though they only\n\n242\n00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:51.696\nhad 1,000 nodes.\n\n243\n00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:54.950\nSo there's 64,000 wasted addresses.\n\n244\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.540\nWe could see, it didn't take\na visionist to see we're gonna run\n\n245\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.500\nout before long as the Internet\nexploded and all that.\n\n246\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.840\nSo they came up with something new, and\nthat was what's called the classless.\n\n247\n00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.290\nWe're gonna drop that\nwhole classful system.\n\n248\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.710\nWe're gonna go\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n249\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.357\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nsay, rather than use default subnet masks,\n\n250\n00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:21.082\nlike all Class As use a 255.0.0.0 and\nClass Bs, 255.255.0.0.\n\n251\n00:14:21.082 --> 00:14:22.015\nWe said, why?\n\n252\n00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:26.000\nWhy don't we just decide that, hey,\nwe know it's gonna start with ones.\n\n253\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.920\nAnd then somewhere along the line\nit's gonna change to zeros and\n\n254\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.550\nit's gonna be zeros\nthe rest of the way out.\n\n255\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:35.050\nWhat if I could take that line and not\nhave to leave it on one of those octets.\n\n256\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.900\nWhat if I could move it around?\n\n257\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.770\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.590\nAnd all I have to do is really\ntell you how many ones are there.\n\n259\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.300\n&gt;&gt; Because if I tell you there's 18 1s.\n\n260\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.693\nWell the first octet's 8.\n\n261\n00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:47.100\nI was at 10 left.\n\n262\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.080\nThe second octet's another 8.\n\n263\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.110\nSo that's 16.\n\n264\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.225\nI get two left.\n\n265\n00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:54.407\nThere's gonna be two bits in\nthat third octet that are 1s.\n\n266\n00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:56.270\nAnd then the rest are gonna be 0s.\n\n267\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.945\nSo all I really had to do,\nyou know there's 32 numbers, 32 1s and 0s.\n\n268\n00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:04.000\nIf I tell you there are 18 1s,\nyou write down 18 1s.\n\n269\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.660\nAnd then whatever it takes to\nget to 32 numbers for 0s, right?\n\n270\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.470\nJust fill the rest of it out,\npad the rest of it, with 0s.\n\n271\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.750\nThat is classless inter-domain routing.\n\n272\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.485\nWe're no longer tied to breaking\nthe subnet mask right on that octet.\n\n273\n00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:20.355\nAnd that freed it up because let's\nlook at my computer again and\n\n274\n00:15:20.355 --> 00:15:21.988\nthink about the logic behind that.\n\n275\n00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:26.515\nI said there's 65,000\nbecause we have 16 bits,\n\n276\n00:15:26.515 --> 00:15:30.398\nthere's 65,000 possible hosts, well.\n\n277\n00:15:30.398 --> 00:15:36.450\nSo the formula is actually because there's\ntwo, it's a base II numbering system.\n\n278\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.320\nSo it's 2 to the power\nof the number of bits.\n\n279\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.600\nSo in other words, 2 to the 16th power.\n\n280\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.690\nThe little 16 above the 2, right?\n\n281\n00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.544\nIs 65,535, or\nsomething right around there.\n\n282\n00:15:49.544 --> 00:15:52.080\nWhen I said there was 255 possible hosts.\n\n283\n00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.810\n2 to the power of 8 is 256, right.\n\n284\n00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.226\nSo that's how we calculate that out.\n\n285\n00:15:57.226 --> 00:16:03.194\nSo now if I can move this around,\n255 wasn't enough, 65,000 was too many.\n\n286\n00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:05.401\nWhat if I could move it somewhere in here?\n\n287\n00:16:05.401 --> 00:16:07.554\nWell, how could I move that number?\n\n288\n00:16:07.554 --> 00:16:10.675\nHow could I put 1s in, say,\nthe first four digits, well,\n\n289\n00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:13.120\nlet's just say the first two digits,\nright?\n\n290\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.910\nMove it over just a little bit.\n\n291\n00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:21.782\nWell, if I turn those first two digits\ninto 1s, What is this number now?\n\n292\n00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:26.388\n11000000 is 192.\n\n293\n00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:28.159\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n294\n00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.447\nWe got a custom subnet mask.\n\n295\n00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:37.298\n255.255.192, now the dividing line is\nright here where those 1s go to 0s.\n\n296\n00:16:37.298 --> 00:16:41.932\nNow I only have 8 and 6, that's 14 0s.\n\n297\n00:16:41.932 --> 00:16:44.890\nSo our 14 bits to work with\nthe host portion of the address.\n\n298\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.670\n2 to the 14th is a lot\nless than 2 to the 16th.\n\n299\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.620\nI don't know what that number is,\nWes, you got it?\n\n300\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.519\n&gt;&gt; No, I do not.\n\n301\n00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:57.390\n&gt;&gt; 2 to the power of 14 is,\n[LAUGH] Excel's not calculating for me.\n\n302\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:02.490\nLet's turn on, I turn my whole\nsheet into text, there we go.\n\n303\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.795\nEquals 2 to the power of 14,\nthat's 16,384.\n\n304\n00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:12.170\nIt's a lot better that 65,000,\nstill too many.\n\n305\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.440\nI could borrow or\nI could take away a few more.\n\n306\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.575\nWhat if I put one more 1 in there, right?\n\n307\n00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:21.117\nSo now, it's 128 plus 64,\n\n308\n00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:27.326\nwhich is 192 plus 32,\nwhich will be 224, right?\n\n309\n00:17:27.326 --> 00:17:28.382\n&gt;&gt; And boy, that bumps it up 32,000.\n\n310\n00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:32.434\n&gt;&gt; So this number goes to a 1.\n\n311\n00:17:32.434 --> 00:17:39.040\nAnd so now, we've only got 8, 9,\n10, 11, 12, 13 on the host bits.\n\n312\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.760\nSo now, only 8,000 possible hosts, right?\n\n313\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.710\nThat's a lot better.\n\n314\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.680\nI'm only getting 8,000\naddresses from IANA.\n\n315\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.930\nThey can give those other\naddresses to somebody else, right?\n\n316\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.270\nThat's the idea behind CIDR.\n\n317\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.220\nClassless interdomain routing,\nCIDR, and we notate it differently.\n\n318\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.480\nRather than just assuming cuz with\nclass A, B, and C, if I saw a 10\n\n319\n00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.690\nin the first octet or a 12, I knew it\nwas a class A, I knew the subnet mask.\n\n320\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.510\nWe talked about the default subnet masks,\nright?\n\n321\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.640\nBut now if we're talking about\nclassless interdomain routing,\n\n322\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.920\nhow do I tell you what my subnet is?\n\n323\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.439\nYou can't just look at it and go,\nthat's a Class B, and assume 255.255.0.0.\n\n324\n00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:21.700\nWe're not using the classes anymore.\n\n325\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.870\nSo what I need to tell you instead is,\nhow many bits are in my subnet mask,\n\n326\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.250\nhow many 1s are in there.\n\n327\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.190\nSo what we do is let's say we wanted\nto use this subnet mask, all right.\n\n328\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:38.430\nThat's 8 bits plus 8 bits plus three more\n1s, that's 16, 17, 18, that's 19 bits.\n\n329\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:46.849\nSo I'd write my address\nsomething like this, 172.16.\n\n330\n00:18:46.849 --> 00:18:48.403\nWhat can I put in there?\n\n331\n00:18:48.403 --> 00:18:55.136\nLet's say 128.0/18.\n\n332\n00:18:55.136 --> 00:18:59.210\nRight, so now you know what my network\naddress is and what my subnet mask is.\n\n333\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.830\nOr if this was an actual host address,\n\n334\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:06.745\nit might look something more like this,\nall right?\n\n335\n00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:10.500\n/18, so\nyou know what the subnet mask is now.\n\n336\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.100\nSo that's CIDR, or\nClassless Interdomain Routing, and\n\n337\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.440\nthat extended the lifetime of IP\nbefore by several years because it\n\n338\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.380\nfreed up a lot of addresses, and\nit was backwards compatible.\n\n339\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.580\nWe didn't have to really change anything\non the way routers worked out on\n\n340\n00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.265\nthe Internet.\n\n341\n00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:28.600\nThey could actually start aggregating\nroutes a little more efficiently.\n\n342\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.990\nIt was a pretty cool\nsolution to a problem.\n\n343\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.803\nIt was meant as a temporary solution, it\nwas never meant to be a permanent solution\n\n344\n00:19:35.803 --> 00:19:40.294\nor a fix for IPv4, because the address\nspace is still too limited in IPv4.\n\n345\n00:19:40.294 --> 00:19:45.580\nYou only have, what did we say, 4 billion,\n200 some odd million addresses.\n\n346\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.210\nAnd I think I read something by Cisco\none time, they figured, on average,\n\n347\n00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.090\npeople have five or six devices.\n\n348\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.800\nAnd there's how many people in the world?\n\n349\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.175\nMultiply that by five?\n\n350\n00:19:54.175 --> 00:19:56.060\n4 billion addresses isn't gonna cut it.\n\n351\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.770\nI can't uniquely identify every machine\nout there on the network or in the world.\n\n352\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.200\nThere's not enough numbers to give\nevery single node a unique IP address.\n\n353\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.650\nSo they came up with something else to\nadd to IPv4 to extend it even more, and\n\n354\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.320\nthat was something called private ranges.\n\n355\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.710\nWithin each class, there's actually a\nrange of addresses that are set aside that\n\n356\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.800\nwe can use internally, without worrying\nabout conflicting with anybody else.\n\n357\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.980\nRemember, the whole point is these\naddresses have to be unique.\n\n358\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.140\nI can't use the same address Wes is using.\n\n359\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.110\nI can't tell these computers apart.\n\n360\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.929\nHow do I know what address you're using\nat your organization on the other\n\n361\n00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:32.940\nside of the world?\n\n362\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.070\nI have no idea.\n\n363\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.960\nI can't just pick a number and\nstart using it and\n\n364\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.590\nhope that nobody else in the entire\nworld is using that IP address, right?\n\n365\n00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.380\nAnd do that successfully, guess\na unique number thousands of times for\n\n366\n00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.840\nall the computers on my network.\n\n367\n00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.550\nIt's not gonna happen, right?\n\n368\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.140\nSo what they did was they\nsaid you know what we'll do,\n\n369\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.369\nwe'll set aside certain numbers\nthat you can use internally, and\n\n370\n00:20:53.369 --> 00:20:56.440\nthen you don't have to worry\nabout conflicting with anybody.\n\n371\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.875\nCuz these numbers will never go out to the\nInternet, we're gonna tell these boarder\n\n372\n00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:05.090\nrouters if it starts with this, do not\nlet it go out to the Internet, all right?\n\n373\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.660\nAnd that's what these are, class A,\n\n374\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.351\nanything that starts with a 10 is\nconsidered private, non-routable.\n\n375\n00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:16.908\nWithin the class B,\nit's 172.16 with a /12.\n\n376\n00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:25.244\nSo 172.16.00 all the way\nto 172.31.255.255.\n\n377\n00:21:25.244 --> 00:21:28.422\nClass C, 192.168.00 /16, so\n\n378\n00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:33.950\nthat's 192.168.00 through 192.168.255.255.\n\n379\n00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.360\nYou can use these internally all day long.\n\n380\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.380\nYou will never conflict with anybody else,\nall right, that's not in your same\n\n381\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.690\nlocal area network because those\naddresses are never gonna go out.\n\n382\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.740\nNow that brings in a whole another\nconversation that's another day.\n\n383\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:53.308\nBecause if I've got an address on\nmy device that's 192.168.10.12,\n\n384\n00:21:53.308 --> 00:21:55.050\nthat's not routable.\n\n385\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.230\nIf I go and open up my browser,\nhow is it gonna go out to the Internet and\n\n386\n00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.370\nget my web page and\n\n387\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.300\nbring it back to me if my IP address is\nnot allowed to go out on the Internet?\n\n388\n00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.360\nWe do something called network\naddress translation, and\n\n389\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.440\nwe temporarily translate it into a public\nIP address that you can use to go out,\n\n390\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.720\nget your web page, come back, and\nthen you have to give up that address.\n\n391\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.030\nIt allows me to use very\nfew public IP addresses,\n\n392\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.550\nshare them basically, and kind of give\nthem out to my clients as needed.\n\n393\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.890\nAnd then they give it\nup when they're done.\n\n394\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.160\nSo it's a pretty cool system, but\nthat's a whole another conversation.\n\n395\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.570\nFor addressing, I need to make sure\nyou can recognize a private address,\n\n396\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.210\nthat's really the big thing here.\n\n397\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.310\nIf you see an address that\nstarts with a 192.168,\n\n398\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.600\nyou need to immediately go,\nthat's a private address.\n\n399\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.800\nThere's no wonder you can't get out to the\nInternet, cuz you're never gonna get out\n\n400\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.320\nwith that address unless we implement\nsome other technology, right?\n\n401\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.060\nSo that's what I wanna\nmake sure you understand.\n\n402\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.950\nWhat the private addresses are,\nalso that CIDR notation,\n\n403\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.040\nhow we denote that the subnet mask.\n\n404\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.141\nWe just list the number of 1s\nthat are in that subnet mask.\n\n405\n00:22:57.141 --> 00:23:01.210\nAll right, Wes,\nI think we've pounded IPv4 pretty good.\n\n406\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.500\nWe've got another addressing\nscheme to go through,\n\n407\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.640\nbut probably not enough time\nleft to hit it just yet.\n\n408\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you're right.\n\n409\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.795\nWe've got so much information that we\nwanna make sure that you have, but\n\n410\n00:23:11.795 --> 00:23:14.550\nthen again, we can't fit all\nsometimes in a half hour segment.\n\n411\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.912\nSo it does look like we are gonna come\nback for another segment here, and\n\n412\n00:23:17.912 --> 00:23:20.338\nwe're gonna come back for\na part four, I believe.\n\n413\n00:23:20.338 --> 00:23:22.826\nAnd Mike, do you have anything else\nyou'd like to throw in this one, or\n\n414\n00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:25.140\nwe're gonna cliff hanger it and\nmake them wait for the next part?\n\n415\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.285\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll leave them hanging\non the edge of their seats.\n\n416\n00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:30.975\nWe've still got subnetting and\nIPv6 to do, so don't go too far.\n\n417\n00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:33.375\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Mike,\nthanks for being here with us.\n\n418\n00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.305\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n419\n00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:38.865\nWe're gonna go ahead and take the time to\nsign out for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n420\n00:23:38.865 -->

Francisco [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.296\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.658\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:14.375\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:18.065\nI’m your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n7\n00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:22.785\nGIAC Security Fundamentals, and\nthe topic that we’ve been looking at over\n\n8\n00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.775\nthe past few episodes has\nbeen networking fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:26.905\nSo, we've got some more to go.\n\n10\n00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.941\nSo, joining us back in the studios is Mr.\nMike Rogers.\n\n11\n00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.060\nMike how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.389\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, doing great [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:35.517\nHope you guys out there are not getting\ntired of network fundamentals just yet,\n\n14\n00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:36.878\ncuz we have a little bit more to go.\n\n15\n00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:40.831\nAll right, we've been talking about IPv4,\nwe got one more thing,\n\n16\n00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.483\nwe need to cover with IPv4, and then we\ngot IPv4 successor to deal with as well.\n\n17\n00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:49.039\nAll right, so\nback to IPv4 we've talked about classful,\n\n18\n00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.240\nwe talked about classless, we talked about\nthe subnet mask and a couple of rules.\n\n19\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.863\nOnes from the left until you get to\nthe zeros and zeros all the way out.\n\n20\n00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.939\nWe talked about how that\nsubnet mask is responsible for\n\n21\n00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:07.540\ndividing the IP address into\na network portion and a node portion.\n\n22\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.510\nWe didn't really cover any Binary ANDing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.710\nThat's gonna be one that I'm\ngonna leave for you guys.\n\n24\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.440\nAnd what you're gonna have to pay\nattention to is, when you're using\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.000\nclassless inter domain routing, we start\nbreaking it in the middle of an octet,\n\n26\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.770\nit does become a little more tricky\nto figure out what the network ID is.\n\n27\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.280\nBecause on some of those bits in\nthe octet are on the network side.\n\n28\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.000\nSome of those bits are on the host side.\n\n29\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.980\nSo when you have a number\nlike 152 in that octet,\n\n30\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.870\nand now you're dividing in the middle.\n\n31\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.011\nThink of a binary version of 152.\n\n32\n00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:43.835\nThere's a 1 out there and a 128,\nthat's gonna be on the network side.\n\n33\n00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:47.050\nBut some of the other bits\nare on the node side, right?\n\n34\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.540\nSo it becomes a little more tricky to\nfigure out what the network ID is.\n\n35\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.906\nSo do practice your ANDing,\nyour binary math.\n\n36\n00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:57.858\nIf you're one of our members, you can get\ninto our library, and you can check out,\n\n37\n00:01:57.858 --> 00:01:59.459\nI know Don and a couple of others.\n\n38\n00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.510\nWes, you've done a couple shows on\nsub netting and in-binary ANDing.\n\n39\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.160\nSo make sure you check those out.\n\n40\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.990\nReal quick refresher on sub netting,\nright?\n\n41\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.930\nWe've talked about how\nwe've got a shortage,\n\n42\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.340\nthat it wasn't the most efficient system.\n\n43\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.960\nAnother way that we deal with that,\nbesides the classless inter domain\n\n44\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.199\nrouting, and the private ranges,\nthat really extended the lifetime of IPv4.\n\n45\n00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:28.075\nAnother thing we can do to make what we\nget a little more efficient is subnet\n\n46\n00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:29.106\nit up, right?\n\n47\n00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:33.516\nWe know a Class C, for example,\nhas 255 possible addresses or 254,\n\n48\n00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.780\nexcuse me, possible addresses on it.\n\n49\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.010\nI don't want 254 nodes\nin a single network,\n\n50\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.780\nthere's a lot of contention going on.\n\n51\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.590\nI might wanna divide that up further.\n\n52\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.420\nWell I can't get any other classes,\nI can't do that through IANA.\n\n53\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.040\nWhat I can do is I can take that and\ndivide it up myself, by borrowing some of\n\n54\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.910\nthe bits that I'm used to using for\nthe host and using them for a subnet ID.\n\n55\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.430\nLet me show you do I\nmean here on my screen.\n\n56\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.208\nSo I've got a spreadsheet and let's\nsay we got an address from the IANA or\n\n57\n00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.358\nICANN of 203.175.10.0.\n\n58\n00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:12.968\nAnd we'll do classless, we're gonna\nsay that it was a 24 bit subnet mask.\n\n59\n00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:14.610\nAnd it went all the way to there.\n\n60\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.780\nSo my network address, easy one to\nfigure out where the ones stop and\n\n61\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.990\nthe zeros begin.\n\n62\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.388\nMy network address is 203.175.10.0.\n\n63\n00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:28.998\nI got eight bytes left to work with my\nhost, means I've got a possible 254 hosts,\n\n64\n00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:33.368\ncuz I can't use all zeros and\nI can't use all ones for the host ID.\n\n65\n00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:36.280\nBut I wanna divide this up even further.\n\n66\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.730\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna borrow a couple of bits.\n\n67\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.630\nThis part stays the same, right?\n\n68\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.330\nThat was assigned to me by IANA or\nICANN or my ISP or whomever.\n\n69\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.760\nSo that part stays the same, I can only\nplay around with these eight bits here.\n\n70\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.347\nI'm gonna take let's say\ntwo of these bits, and\n\n71\n00:03:54.347 --> 00:03:58.010\nit depends on how many\nsubnets you wanna make.\n\n72\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.100\nIf I take one bit from the host.\n\n73\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.970\nNow say I'm gonna use that for a subnet.\n\n74\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.200\nHow many unique subnets\ncan I come up with?\n\n75\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.594\nOr how many possible values can I have?\n\n76\n00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:08.162\nA zero or a one?\n\n77\n00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:12.080\nSo I can only have two subnets there,\na zero or a one.\n\n78\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.640\nI get the other seven bits for the host.\n\n79\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.313\n2 to the 7th, 2 times 2 is 4,\n8, 16, 32, 64, 128.\n\n80\n00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:26.780\nI have two subnets with about 128 minus 2,\nso 126 hosts on each subnet.\n\n81\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.900\nIf I borrow two bits,\nnow how many subnets can I come up with?\n\n82\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.040\n0 0, 0 1, 1 0, and 1 1.\n\n83\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.510\nI got four unique numbers that I\ncan create using those two bits.\n\n84\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.420\nSo I can create four subnets\nby borrowing two bits.\n\n85\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.385\nIf I borrowed three bits from the host,\nwell,\n\n86\n00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:52.767\nnow I can have 001, 010, 100, 011.\n\n87\n00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:54.150\nI'm not gonna go through all of them.\n\n88\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.933\nIt would be 2 to the 3rd.\n\n89\n00:04:56.933 --> 00:04:59.260\n2 times 2 is 4, times 2 is 8.\n\n90\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.690\nI'd have eight subnets,\nthat I can create borrowing three bits.\n\n91\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.250\nBut every time I borrow a bit\nto make my subnet ID bigger,\n\n92\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.700\nso I can make more subnets,\nwhat am I taking those bits from?\n\n93\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.750\nThe host portion of the address.\n\n94\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.060\nSo if I borrow three\nbits to raise subnet IDs,\n\n95\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.200\nI've only got five bits left for my hosts.\n\n96\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.414\nAnd if I have five bits, 2 to the 5th.\n\n97\n00:05:23.414 --> 00:05:26.242\n2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16, 32.\n\n98\n00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:30.785\nNow, I can have up to eight subnets,\nbut only, 2 to the 2 is 4, 8,\n\n99\n00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:35.252\n16, 32, I couldn't remember,\nbut only 32 host per subnet.\n\n100\n00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.320\nYou see what I'm saying?\n\n101\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.435\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n102\n00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:41.941\nYou can create more and more subnets,\nbut now, you're have less bits left for\n\n103\n00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.930\nthe host portion of that address.\n\n104\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.980\nAnd here's an example, I borrowed two.\n\n105\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.670\nSo, I've got the first is 0001.\n\n106\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.676\n10 and 11.\n\n107\n00:05:51.676 --> 00:05:56.446\nAnd then my first host, well, 00001,\n\n108\n00:05:56.446 --> 00:06:00.343\nmy last host, 11110, right?\n\n109\n00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:02.659\nBecause I can't do all ones and\nI can't do all zeroes.\n\n110\n00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.520\nSo if we were to convert that back,\nthis number is a one.\n\n111\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.550\nAnd this number would be a 62.\n\n112\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.705\nMy next ID is 01.\n\n113\n00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.710\nI've only got six bits left for the host.\n\n114\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.350\nSo my first host is 000001, but\n\n115\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.430\nwhen I turn this octet back into decimal,\nI'm not looking at just this host portion.\n\n116\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.260\nI'm looking at all eight bits, so\nthe last octet would actually be 65,\n\n117\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.130\nright, for that particular host.\n\n118\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.390\nThat's again where it starts\ngetting a little tricky.\n\n119\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.988\nSome of the bits are on\nthe subnet ID side,\n\n120\n00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:41.303\nsome of the bits are on the host side.\n\n121\n00:06:41.303 --> 00:06:44.718\nSo it becomes where you can't just\nsimply look at the number, and\n\n122\n00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:48.510\ngo, yeah, that's the network ID,\nthat's the host portion.\n\n123\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.740\nYou really gotta do your Binary math,\nand start doing your ANDing.\n\n124\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.612\nSo do make sure you check that out.\n\n125\n00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:57.820\nAll right, and that's probably enough for\nsub-netting for this.\n\n126\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.939\nAgain, if you need a refresher on that,\nmake sure you go to the course library and\n\n127\n00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.950\nbone up on sub-netting cuz, they very\nwell could ask you a couple questions.\n\n128\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.800\nThey probably not gonna make\nyou subnet but they might say,\n\n129\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.966\nhow many host can you\nhave on this network, or\n\n130\n00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:14.630\nsome question like that and\nyou gotta understand the way this works.\n\n131\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.460\n&gt;&gt; And Mike that kind of like, puts\neverything in a perspective what you've\n\n132\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.010\nbeen telling us about,\nwhy would we even care about Binary.\n\n133\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.190\nYou say, I as a human recognize only\ndecimal well then I am a human,\n\n134\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.100\nwell I think I am [LAUGH].\n\n135\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.040\nWhy do I just stay with the decimal.\n\n136\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.640\nWhy do I even care about the binary?\n\n137\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.860\nNow it kinda comes back to totality,\n\n138\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.880\nas to why we need to understand\nthat that Binary is there.\n\n139\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.383\nAnd kinda understand what those bits are\ndoing, so it's starting to make sense now.\n\n140\n00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:39.130\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.\n\n141\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.469\nAll right, so let's move on to the new\nIP addressing scheme that's out,\n\n142\n00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.723\nand that is IPv6, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:46.723 --> 00:07:50.892\nIPv6 is the successor to IPv4.\n\n144\n00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:55.112\nWe've said a couple times, there are only\n4 billion plus addresses in the IPv4\n\n145\n00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:58.725\nworld, and that's assuming you\ncould use every single one of them.\n\n146\n00:07:58.725 --> 00:07:59.469\nWhich we can't.\n\n147\n00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:02.393\nWe saw a class d and\nclass e were kind of off limits.\n\n148\n00:08:02.393 --> 00:08:06.450\nSo that 4 billion, I mean,\nalready a big chunk has been pulled out.\n\n149\n00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.998\nSo you can see, definitely, not enough\nunique numbers in that addressing scheme.\n\n150\n00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.460\nSo IPv6 solves that problem.\n\n151\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.260\nIPv6, and let's go ahead and take a look\nat my screen here because it's easier\n\n152\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.820\nto see it, to start to visualize it.\n\n153\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.389\nWhereas IPv4 is a 32 bit binary number, so\n\n154\n00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:31.280\n32 1s and 0s,\nIPv6 is a 128 bit binary number.\n\n155\n00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.935\nThat's right, four times the number of\nbits in an IPv4, IPv6 address, right?\n\n156\n00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:42.487\nNow if we wanna figure out how many\npossible unique numbers I can come up\n\n157\n00:08:42.487 --> 00:08:46.267\nwith 128 bits,\nthat would be 2 to the power of 128,\n\n158\n00:08:46.267 --> 00:08:51.130\nwhich is another number we typically know,\nWes, you remember that one?\n\n159\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.064\n&gt;&gt; What was it, 2 to the power of 128,\ngoodness, this is 340 undecillion,\n\n160\n00:08:56.064 --> 00:08:58.920\nand yes, I did say that,\nthat is a big number.\n\n161\n00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.520\n&gt;&gt; It is a huge number.\n\n162\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.310\nAn undecillion, if you don't know it,\n\n163\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.460\nI had to look it up\nthe first time I heard it.\n\n164\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.130\nGo check out Wikipedia or\nsomething like that.\n\n165\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.460\nAn undecillion is basically a 1 and\n\n166\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.344\nthen 000,000, until you have 12 commas.\n\n167\n00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:18.460\nNot 12 0s, 12 commas, right?\n\n168\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.220\nSo just do that one time, take a piece\nof paper out, go one comma, 000,\n\n169\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.990\ncomma, and keep going until you have\na number that has 12 commas in it.\n\n170\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.690\nYou'll probably have to go to\nthe next line of your piece of paper,\n\n171\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.180\nthat's an undecillion.\n\n172\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.190\nWe don't have one undecillion,\nwe have 340 undecillion addresses.\n\n173\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.193\nSo they're kind of future\nproofing us with this one, right?\n\n174\n00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:41.760\nThey're saying we're not gonna\nmake that same mistake again.\n\n175\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.247\nBy the time we run out of these addresses,\n\n176\n00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:48.535\nwe'll be doing holographic quantum\nsome other kind of addressing.\n\n177\n00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.225\nWe won't even need this kind of stuff.\n\n178\n00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:53.995\n&gt;&gt; I've heard of an analogy cuz I had\nto do this one time, like Mike says,\n\n179\n00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:54.755\ngo to Wikipedia.\n\n180\n00:09:54.755 --> 00:09:58.795\nI heard somebody say one time that if\nyou took all of the IPv4 addresses and\n\n181\n00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:02.400\nyou converted each individual one into\nits own grain of sand, we can take all of\n\n182\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.770\nthat sand, and we could put it very\ncomfortably in a small moving truck and\n\n183\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.220\nhave a lot of space left over.\n\n184\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.597\nHowever, if we did that to the IPv6 block,\nand\n\n185\n00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:12.570\nthere's 340 undecillion\nthat Mike's talking about,\n\n186\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.732\nconverting each possibility into a grain\nof sand, it would take a container that is\n\n187\n00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:20.670\n1.3 billion times the circumference of\nour Earth to contain all that sand.\n\n188\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.320\nSo future proof,\nI think that's an understatement.\n\n189\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it comes out to so\n\n190\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.438\nmany million addresses per square\nmeter of the Earth's surface.\n\n191\n00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:36.210\nAnd that wasn't the goal actually of the\nIANA was to make a pool huge of addresses,\n\n192\n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.600\nI mean, let's just make it bigger and\nbigger and bigger, and where do you stop?\n\n193\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.520\nIt was really getting a number big enough\n\n194\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.780\nthat allows me to do\nsome really neat things.\n\n195\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.350\nWhere I can start segregating that number,\n\n196\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.340\nusing part of it to represent\ngeographical regions.\n\n197\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.500\nOr it ends up making routing\na lot more efficient.\n\n198\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.480\nThat's a big problem we\nhave in the IPv4 world\n\n199\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.770\nis that the routers on the internet\nhave to maintain literally hundreds of\n\n200\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.960\nthousands of routes to get packets from me\nto whatever random website I wanna go to.\n\n201\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.487\nWe get into IPv6, and because of the way\nthis is numbered, the number's so big.\n\n202\n00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:15.662\nI can use some of those numbers,\nnot to represent network,\n\n203\n00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:18.980\nnot to represent node, but\nto represent a routing district.\n\n204\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.120\nOr I'm not sure, I'm trying to\nthink of the exact terminology,\n\n205\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.180\nbut it's kind of like a zip code, right?\n\n206\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.617\nWhen you mail a letter, the post\noffice that you're sending it from,\n\n207\n00:11:28.617 --> 00:11:30.771\nwhen it gets picked up\nby your mail carrier,\n\n208\n00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:33.760\nthey don't look at the street\naddress of where it's going.\n\n209\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.128\nThey look at the zip code, and they know\nthat's the other side of the country,\n\n210\n00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:38.910\nand boom, they send it.\n\n211\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.360\nWhen it gets to that postal office on\nthe other side of the country that handles\n\n212\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.760\nthat zip code, they can worry about the\nmore detailed portion of the address and\n\n213\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.020\nget it delivered to the final destination.\n\n214\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.145\nIt's the same way these IPv6\nnumbers are gonna work.\n\n215\n00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:54.140\nThose routers get this packet coming in,\nthey look at the destination.\n\n216\n00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.050\nThey go, they just look at the first, they\ndon't have to look at the entire number.\n\n217\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.090\nThey can look at the first part and go,\nthat's that over there in Australia.\n\n218\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.730\nBoom, and send it.\n\n219\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.000\nOnce it gets to that ISP or\nthat carrier over there,\n\n220\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.630\nthey can deal with the more\ndetailed portion of the address and\n\n221\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.130\nactually deliver that final\nleg of its journey, right?\n\n222\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.090\nSo, and again,\n\n223\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:16.040\nthat's the non-technical explanation\nof some of the features of IPv6.\n\n224\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.380\nBut it's one of the cool things that\nwe get from having such a large number,\n\n225\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.960\nso it's not just about making enough\nunique addresses to cover all the devices.\n\n226\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.840\nIt's about making\na number that's scalable,\n\n227\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.660\nthat also helps with the routing.\n\n228\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.840\nBecause as the Internet gets bigger and\nbigger and more and\n\n229\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.290\nmore nodes are on the network, it's\nthe routing that's gonna slow us down.\n\n230\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.080\nAnd this is gonna help speed that back up,\nall right?\n\n231\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.810\nAll right, so\nwe got this 128 bit binary number.\n\n232\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.760\nWe said 32 1s and\n0s was too many to write, so\n\n233\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.730\n128 is definitely too many to write.\n\n234\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.870\nSo we're gonna have to change that up.\n\n235\n00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.550\nBut if I put it in decimal notation, it's\nstill going to be a pretty large number.\n\n236\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.530\nSo, what we're going to do is\nchange that to hexadecimal.\n\n237\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.630\nWe'll write IPv6 addresses in hexadecimal.\n\n238\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.570\nRemember, a hexadecimal character\ndigit is 4 bits, all right?\n\n239\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.737\nSo we can take 128 bits,\n\n240\n00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:20.434\ndivide it by 4, and that gives me 32.\n\n241\n00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:23.840\nSo I'm gonna have 32\nhexadecimal characters.\n\n242\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.160\nThat's a little more reasonable.\n\n243\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.426\nThat's a number that I can type, that I\ncould memorize, maybe [LAUGH], maybe not,\n\n244\n00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:36.040\nbut it's a little bit large for that, but\nit's a lot easier to work with, right?\n\n245\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.920\nTo look at, to type in,\nand things like that.\n\n246\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.524\nSo we'll just convert it into hexadecimal,\nso\n\n247\n00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:45.946\nwhat we do is like I've\ngot on my screen here,\n\n248\n00:13:45.946 --> 00:13:50.469\nthis whole number like that\nis your IPv6 address, right?\n\n249\n00:13:50.469 --> 00:13:53.540\nThat's 128 1s and 0s.\n\n250\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.440\nWhat I've done is I've taken 4 bits and\nput it here, the next 4 bits, put it here.\n\n251\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.400\nSo I took that 128 bits,\n\n252\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.510\ndivided it up into little chunks\nof 4 bits each, all right?\n\n253\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:11.529\nNow that I've got 4 bits, we know that\na hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits,\n\n254\n00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:18.003\nso I can just take each one of those and\nconvert it, 1101 is a D, 10010 is a 2.\n\n255\n00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:22.374\nSo I just went down this whole thing and I\ndo have to kind of scroll a little bit to\n\n256\n00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:27.700\nsee it all, right, all I did was convert\nthose 4 bits into a hexadecimal digit.\n\n257\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.350\nThen we take that and we divide it up\nbecause one string of 32 hexadecimal\n\n258\n00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.050\ncharacters is still a little bit awkward,\nso we're gonna divide that up.\n\n259\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.000\nJust like we took our decimal number and\n\n260\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.550\ncreated octets, divided those bits up\ninto 8 bit chunks with decimal points,\n\n261\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.679\nwe're gonna take this and divide it\nup into 4 hexadecimal characters.\n\n262\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.510\nWhich would be 16 bits, and we're gonna\ndivide that up 16 bits at a time,\n\n263\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.540\nusing colons, not decimals.\n\n264\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.080\nWe're gonna use a colon.\n\n265\n00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.840\nSo, we call this one coloned hexadecimal\nversus dotted decimal in our IPv4.\n\n266\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.222\nDotted decimal because we're using dots,\nand it's a decimal numbering system.\n\n267\n00:15:12.222 --> 00:15:13.400\nColoned hexadecimal,\n\n268\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.930\ncolons as the separator, hexadecimal\nas the numbering system, all right?\n\n269\n00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.360\nSo that whole long number here,\nthis 128 bits,\n\n270\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.110\ncan actually be represented right\nthere in hexadecimal, all right?\n\n271\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.084\nSo that is an IPv6 address.\n\n272\n00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:33.000\nNow even that is a little bit long, right?\n\n273\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.160\nIt's kind of awkward to write out.\n\n274\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.870\nSo there are shortcuts to writing IPv6\naddresses and working with IPv6 addresses.\n\n275\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.680\nSo let's take a look at those next.\n\n276\n00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:47.245\nAll right, so there's a couple\nof different tricks we can use\n\n277\n00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:48.275\nto shorten that up.\n\n278\n00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:51.855\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit, so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n279\n00:15:51.855 --> 00:15:54.807\nHere's an address, an IPv6 address.\n\n280\n00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:58.871\nAnd the first thing we can do\nis we can drop leading 0s.\n\n281\n00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:03.760\nWe know that every group has\nfour hexidecimal digits in it.\n\n282\n00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.310\nLike this second group here is 0db8.\n\n283\n00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.840\nThis third one is 0000.\n\n284\n00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.916\nThe next one is 0001.\n\n285\n00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:15.600\nWhat I can do is I can just\ndrop off the leading zeros.\n\n286\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.043\nNotice how I just have db8.\n\n287\n00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:18.570\nThere's no zero.\n\n288\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.660\nAll right,\njust this next one is just a 0, it's :0:.\n\n289\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.160\nI've dropped off the first three zeros.\n\n290\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.930\nThe next one which was 0001,\nbecomes just a 1.\n\n291\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.840\nI can drop the leading zeros,\n\n292\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.940\nbecause we know we can assume that\nthere's always four characters, and\n\n293\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.500\nif you drop one out it had to have been\na 0, it's the only thing that's allowed.\n\n294\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.600\nSo, leading zeros can be dropped.\n\n295\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.960\nAnd now, we can see, I have a much\nshorter version of that same address.\n\n296\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.080\nIt can be put back together\neasily by saying, wait,\n\n297\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.270\nthere's only three characters, db8?\n\n298\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.907\nThere must have been a zero out there.\n\n299\n00:16:55.907 --> 00:16:58.430\nThis one is just a single zero.\n\n300\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.080\nThere should have been four characters, so\n\n301\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.530\nI'll just put three zeros\nout in front of it, right?\n\n302\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.000\nSo we can rebuild it very easily,\ncomputers can rebuild it very easily,\n\n303\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.460\nyet it makes it a lot shorter and\neasier for us to write.\n\n304\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.863\n&gt;&gt; You know Mike, I didn't even really\nmention this, but I've seen that the IPV4\n\n305\n00:17:12.863 --> 00:17:16.183\nwas essentially doing the same thing\nwithout even thinking about it, right?\n\n306\n00:17:16.183 --> 00:17:22.340\nYou had a 192.168.10.54 yet,\nthose are supposed to be three zeros.\n\n307\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.150\nBut, they don't include them, right?\n\n308\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.380\nThey don't say 0-54 or 0-0-1.\n\n309\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.860\nSo, the concept looks like\nit's close to the same.\n\n310\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very, very similar.\n\n311\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.330\nExactly right.\n\n312\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.890\nAnd this one can be shortened to.\n\n313\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:39.184\nBecause another cool thing we can do is if\nwe have multiple blocks of zeros in a row,\n\n314\n00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:39.733\nright.\n\n315\n00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:41.256\nHere I've dropped all the leading zeros.\n\n316\n00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:46.064\nSo it's 0:0: 0:1.\n\n317\n00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:49.183\nWell all these zeros that in a row,\n\n318\n00:17:49.183 --> 00:17:53.925\nI can simply drop them out and\nleave the outer colon.\n\n319\n00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:57.839\nSo notice what I did here,\nright there if you can see that.\n\n320\n00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:59.250\nIt's 2001:db8:0:1::1.\n\n321\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.190\nAll right?\n\n322\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:08.372\nAnd why does that work?\n\n323\n00:18:08.372 --> 00:18:15.290\nWell because we know the rules say there\nare eight groups in an IPv6 address.\n\n324\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:22.540\nThere is only one, two, three, four, five\nin the address I've have written here.\n\n325\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.320\nSo that colon colon must represent\nthe three missing groups of zeros, right?\n\n326\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.280\nIt's that simple.\n\n327\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.950\nIf you got blocks of zeros in a row,\nyou can just leave them all out.\n\n328\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.790\nJust put colon, colon and\n\n329\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.230\nI can figure out how many zeros should've\nbeen there by what's still there.\n\n330\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.410\nFive groups left that means there's three\ngroups missing, they were all zeros.\n\n331\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now if I'm looking at\nan IPv6 address let's say on an exam.\n\n332\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.610\nI'm sitting on that hot seat.\n\n333\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.680\nMan, I'm sweating it and I see an IPv6,\nwhat I think is an IPv6 question,\n\n334\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.880\nand it's got two of\nthe colon colons there.\n\n335\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.270\nIs that a valid IPv6 address?\n\n336\n00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.900\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, and it is not.\n\n337\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.510\nLet's take a look.\n\n338\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.985\nWell let's talk about why and\nwe'll take a look as well as why or\n\n339\n00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:07.098\nI'll show you why you can't do that.\n\n340\n00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:09.776\nHere's another address,\n\n341\n00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:15.710\n2001:db8:0:0:1234:0:0:1.\n\n342\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:20.460\nAnd you might think to yourself,\nblocks of zeroes in a row, I can just drop\n\n343\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.140\nthose zeros out and leave the outer colons\nso we could do something like this.\n\n344\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:31.214\n2001:db8:: representing those\nfirst set of continuous zeroes,\n\n345\n00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:38.750\n1234:: representing the second block\nof contiguous zeros and then a 1.\n\n346\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.470\nWell, that's following your rules Mike.\n\n347\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.700\nYou said if I had zeros in a row,\nI could just drop them all out and\n\n348\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.230\nleave the outer two colons and\nwe're good to go.\n\n349\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.100\nThe problem is when you try to rebuild\nit you don't know where the zeros go.\n\n350\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.490\nYes, I do.\n\n351\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.200\nNo, you don't know how\nmany zeroes go where.\n\n352\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.400\nThat's the problem.\n\n353\n00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.540\nIf you just had this, didn't have\nany of the other information, and\n\n354\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:06.920\nI said put that address back, write it out\nall 128 or all 32 accessible characters.\n\n355\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.040\nHow would you do it?\n\n356\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.430\nWell how many blocks do I have left?\n\n357\n00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.560\nOne, two, three, four, so\nthere's four missing blocks.\n\n358\n00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.356\nWe know those are blocks of zeros.\n\n359\n00:20:18.356 --> 00:20:20.670\nI've got two colons here and\nI've got two colons here.\n\n360\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:26.770\nThe problem is, was it three blocks of\nzeroes here and one block of zeros here?\n\n361\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.500\nOr was it one block of zeros here,\nand three blocks of zeros here?\n\n362\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.721\nOr was it two here and two here?\n\n363\n00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:38.027\nYou have no way of knowing, there's\nnothing left to help you figure that out,\n\n364\n00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:40.290\nso it cannot be put back together.\n\n365\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.370\nSo you can only do the colon\ncolon once in an address.\n\n366\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.740\nEven if you have two separate\nareas of contiguous zeros,\n\n367\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.540\nyou have to pick which one, all right.\n\n368\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.010\nUsually, the longer of the two is the one\nI'm going to do the colon colon for\n\n369\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.520\ncuz its less typing and\nless writing, all right.\n\n370\n00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.109\nSo, both of these would be acceptable.\n\n371\n00:20:58.109 --> 00:21:00.205\nOops, we wanna get out of that.\n\n372\n00:21:00.205 --> 00:21:05.689\n2001:db8::1234, since I've\nalready used the colon colon,\n\n373\n00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:08.956\nI cannot use the colon\ncolon to replace this.\n\n374\n00:21:08.956 --> 00:21:11.730\nSo, :0:0:1.\n\n375\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:18.111\nOr I could have gone the other way,\n2001 db8:0:1234::1.\n\n376\n00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:22.110\nSo you can only do the colon colon\nonce in a single IPv6 address.\n\n377\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.170\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n378\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.310\nSo you say, okay, if it's easier to type,\n\n379\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.850\nI'll take, in this case, the majority\nof the blocks that I can shorten.\n\n380\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.120\nBut I can also still abbreviate cuz\nlike you said, with the leading zeros,\n\n381\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.738\nwe can go a little bit farther than that.\n\n382\n00:21:34.738 --> 00:21:35.547\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It's just really up to us.\n\n383\n00:21:35.547 --> 00:21:39.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n384\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.677\nLook at the first one we did up here,\n2001:dv8:0:1:0:0:0:1.\n\n385\n00:21:44.677 --> 00:21:49.610\nI could have put the colon, colon right\nhere and drop this block of zeros.\n\n386\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.490\nBut then I'd have to write\nall three of these zeros cuz\n\n387\n00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.250\nI can't do the colon colon again.\n\n388\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.520\nSo I said, you know what,\nit's easier if I drag this zero and\n\n389\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.660\nuse the colon colon to\nrepresent these three zeros.\n\n390\n00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.720\nIt's much less typing to do,\nmuch less entry to do, right?\n\n391\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.400\nSo those are a couple of\ntricks you can do with IPv6.\n\n392\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.200\nDrop your leading zeros,\ncondense a block of zeros to a single\n\n393\n00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.560\nzero which is basically the same\nthing of dropping your leading zeros.\n\n394\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.330\nAnd then use colon colon for\nmultiple blocks of zeros in a row.\n\n395\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.940\nBut only once.\n\n396\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.630\nNext with IPv6, let's talk about prefixes.\n\n397\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.030\nIPv6 doesn't use subnet masks\nlike we talked about with IPv4.\n\n398\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.260\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n399\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.960\nIt basically takes that CIDR notation and\nbrings that over with it.\n\n400\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.240\nWhat we're gonna do with IPv6 is we're\ngonna use that similar notation,\n\n401\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.220\na slash and then a number,\n\n402\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.940\nto represent how many bits are part\nof what's called the prefix.\n\n403\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.200\nAn IPv6 address is 128 bits.\n\n404\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.050\nAnd really it's divided in a half.\n\n405\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:04.460\nThe first 64 bits are for network ID,\nrouting, subnet IDs all that staff.\n\n406\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.900\nThe last 64 bits are for your host.\n\n407\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.102\nTherefore, identifying a unique host,\nthose will always be unique, the last 64.\n\n408\n00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:15.710\nSo we're really basically\ndividing it into half\n\n409\n00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:20.680\nwhich means most IPv6 addresses are gonna\nbe written down with a slash 64.\n\n410\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.902\nIndicating that the first 64\nbits are on that side and\n\n411\n00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:28.710\nthey're gonna represent things like\nrouting prefix, global routing prefix or\n\n412\n00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:34.130\ncompany ID, or subnet mask or, I'm sorry\nnot subnet mask, subnet ID, network ID.\n\n413\n00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.130\nThe last 64 are gonna be for\nyour host portion.\n\n414\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.410\nThere are a few prefixes that\nwe should really just know.\n\n415\n00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.587\nAnd that's what I've got\nup on my screen here.\n\n416\n00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:46.720\nThese are our special numbers.\n\n417\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.539\nLike in IPv4, we have special numbers.\n\n418\n00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:53.343\nWe know that a 0.0.0.0 is\nan unspecified address,\n\n419\n00:23:53.343 --> 00:23:56.601\nwe know that 127001 is\na loop back address,\n\n420\n00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:01.201\nwe know that a 169254 something,\nsomething is APIPA, right?\n\n421\n00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:05.491\nSo there are special numbers\nin IPv4 Also in IPv6.\n\n422\n00:24:05.491 --> 00:24:09.103\n::1/128.\n\n423\n00:24:09.103 --> 00:24:10.968\nWow, what does that mean?\n\n424\n00:24:10.968 --> 00:24:15.008\nWell, :: that means everything is a zero,\nexcept for the very last lock.\n\n425\n00:24:15.008 --> 00:24:20.955\nSo that's basically 127 0s and\na 1 for the last bit.\n\n426\n00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:24.117\nAnd it's saying 128,\nthey're saying the entire number,\n\n427\n00:24:24.117 --> 00:24:25.679\nnone of its ever gonna change.\n\n428\n00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:27.158\nThe whole thing is your prefix.\n\n429\n00:24:27.158 --> 00:24:31.500\nThat is your loopback address in IPv6 ::1,\nalright?\n\n430\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.735\nUnspecified is ::/128.\n\n431\n00:24:33.735 --> 00:24:41.238\n::, no numbers at all, that means you\ngot 128 0s, and that's it, right?\n\n432\n00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:48.167\nIn IPv4 it was easy, we could type 0.0.0.0\nto specify an unspecified address, wow.\n\n433\n00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:49.485\n&gt;&gt; That's redundancy.\n\n434\n00:24:49.485 --> 00:24:52.883\n&gt;&gt; That is.\nTo indicate an unspecified address.\n\n435\n00:24:52.883 --> 00:24:58.207\nTry doing 0000:0000:0000:000,\n\n436\n00:24:58.207 --> 00:25:01.450\nuntil you have 132 0s.\n\n437\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.750\nWell, that's ridiculous.\n\n438\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.800\nSo how about just ::, right?\n\n439\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.570\nThat means they're all zeros,\nit's unspecified.\n\n440\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.720\nAny IPV6 address that starts with\nan FE80 is considered link local.\n\n441\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.800\nAnd that means it's the same thing\nas a private IP address in IPV4.\n\n442\n00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:19.690\nAll right?\n\n443\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.550\nWe got those private,\nnon-routeable addresses that\n\n444\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.180\nare not allowed to go out to the Internet\nthat you can use internally.\n\n445\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.820\nAnd they won't conflict with anybody else.\n\n446\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.850\nWe have the same thing IPv6.\n\n447\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.500\nIt's an FE80.\n\n448\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.570\nAnything that starts with FE80 is not\nallowed to go out to the Internet.\n\n449\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.740\nIt's considered local to\nthat particular subnet.\n\n450\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.065\nWe also have unique locals that\ncan be routed internally but\n\n451\n00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:43.470\nnot out to the Internet.\n\n452\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.260\nThose are fc00.\n\n453\n00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.310\nMulticast is anything\nthat starts with an FF00.\n\n454\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.130\nGlobal Unicasts start with 2000,\nall right?\n\n455\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.590\nA Global Unicast address,\nthis is one that can be routed.\n\n456\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.380\nThis is like an IPv4 public IP address.\n\n457\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.540\nIt has to be unique throughout\nthe entire world and\n\n458\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.620\nit is routeable out there on the internet.\n\n459\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.600\nAnd then there's one for documentation.\n\n460\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.810\nWhen you read things about IPv6,\nwhen you go read the RFCs from the IETF or\n\n461\n00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.480\nsomething like that which I know\neverybody out there is doing.\n\n462\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.950\nI know I love to do that.\n\n463\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.826\nThey'll use example addresses.\n\n464\n00:26:21.826 --> 00:26:28.180\n2001:db8 is set aside for that purpose,\nso that anytime you see that, you know\n\n465\n00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.795\nthis is an example and I need to replace\nit with actual IPv6 addresses, right?\n\n466\n00:26:32.795 --> 00:26:38.679\nSo 2001:db8::, means the rest of its 0s,\nis gonna be for documentation.\n\n467\n00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.820\nAll right.\nLast thing we're going to talk\n\n468\n00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.410\nabout with IPv6 is going to be subnetting.\n\n469\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.350\nBut unfortunately,\n\n470\n00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.110\nit's going to take me more than the time\nthat Wes is telling me that I've got left.\n\n471\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.860\nSo I'm going to turn it back over to Wes.\n\n472\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.540\nLet him close it out.\n\n473\n00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.457\nWe're going to have to come back for yet\nanother part of network fundamentals.\n\n474\n00:26:57.457 --> 00:27:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Well what can you say about that,\nno questions needed, Mike.\n\n475\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.432\nSo that's a great place to wrap up, we do\nappreciate, Mike, as always you being here\n\n476\n00:27:04.432 --> 00:27:07.860\nin the studio with us and\nwe do appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n477\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.700\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n478\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.393\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n479\n00:27:15.393 --> 00:27:21.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n480\n00:27:21.384 -->

00:00:08.333\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.700\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting episode\nhere at ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.990\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our GIAC security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.850\nAnd we've been really in networking\nfundamentals here for a few episodes and\n\n8\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.460\nwell, we're back with the part six because\nthere's plenty of information you have to\n\n9\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.620\nget under your belt if you're\ngonna tackle this exam.\n\n10\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.870\nAnd joining us for\nthis endeavor is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.080\nMike, how you doing today, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.880\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.450\nAnd yeah,\nwe've got a little bit more to go.\n\n15\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.810\nWe've covered a lot so far when it\ncomes to these network fundamentals.\n\n16\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.470\nAll stuff that we probably\nshould be at this point,\n\n17\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.760\nat least a little familiar with.\n\n18\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.330\nJust wanna make sure we cover it all so\nyou know what you don't know, or anything\n\n19\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.710\nyou're not familiar with make sure you\ngo out and do a little more studying on.\n\n20\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.428\nWe've talked about network types,\nnetwork topologies,\n\n21\n00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:57.590\ninterconnectivity devices,\nwe looked at protocols on LAN and WAN.\n\n22\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.205\nWe looked at IPv4 pretty extensively,\nand now we've been going over IPv6.\n\n23\n00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:05.828\nSo we got a little bit\nmore to do with IPv6.\n\n24\n00:01:05.828 --> 00:01:11.178\nWe still need to make sure we\nunderstand how to subnet IPv6.\n\n25\n00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.980\nAnd you might think to yourself,\ngosh here we go,\n\n26\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.910\nhow in the world are we\ngonna subnet with IPv6?\n\n27\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.653\nWe got 128 bytes, there's no subnet mask,\nthis is gonna be crazy.\n\n28\n00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:23.462\nAnd actually Wes, I'll tell you,\n\n29\n00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:26.940\nI think it's even easier\nthan subnetting with IPv4.\n\n30\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.858\nWith IPv4 it was limited space,\nyou only had 32 bits.\n\n31\n00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:34.671\nAnd the reasons that they made\nthis IPv6 address space so\n\n32\n00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:39.500\nbig, or the number so large,\nis not just to give a lot of addresses.\n\n33\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.930\nThey understand that 340 undecillion\naddresses is way overkill.\n\n34\n00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.330\nThat's millions of addresses per\nsquare meter of the Earth's surface,\n\n35\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.670\nand we just don't need that many.\n\n36\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.320\nSo why is that number so big?\n\n37\n00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.480\nWell, it's because we can\nnow chunk that number up.\n\n38\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.910\nAnd use parts of it for other things.\n\n39\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.600\nAnd when I say other things,\nI mean routing.\n\n40\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.290\nAnd I think we hinted\non that the other day.\n\n41\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.900\nWe talked a little bit about\nhow much more efficient.\n\n42\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.470\nIt can look at the first part of the\naddress and go that's going to Australia.\n\n43\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.280\nAnd boom, send it on it's way and\nnot look at the rest of the address.\n\n44\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940\nOnce it gets to one of the ISPs\nover there in Australia,\n\n45\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.320\nthey can look at the more detailed\nportion of the address and\n\n46\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.780\ndeliver it to the proper network\nthere on that ISPs controls.\n\n47\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.130\nSo it makes the backbone routers much more\nefficient, which makes everything faster.\n\n48\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.680\nAnd with the growth of the Internet and\nthe number of\n\n49\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.190\nthings that we add to it everyday,\nevery little bit we can do helps.\n\n50\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.220\nSo that's gonna ease the burden.\n\n51\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.980\nI think last time I checked, and these\nnumbers are probably not all that current,\n\n52\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.550\nthey were 300,000 routes that these\nrouters had to maintain with IPv4.\n\n53\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.930\nThat's a lot of routes to look through.\n\n54\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.170\nYou think a packet comes in,\nit's got a destination address and\n\n55\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.840\nthis router has to go\nthrough those different\n\n56\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.470\nroutes to figure out which\nway to send it to get there.\n\n57\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920\nThat's a lot of processing it has to do,\nit takes time.\n\n58\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.990\nAnd that's the kind of thing\nwe can speed up with IPv6.\n\n59\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.600\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, that was one of the things\nyou had mentioned in a previous part here\n\n60\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.070\nin networking fundamentals.\n\n61\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.290\nThat that was the purpose of\nclassless interdomain routing, for\n\n62\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.750\nroute summarization.\n\n63\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.870\nI don't have to know all of these routes\non my ISP, if you've got 500 routes into\n\n64\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.690\none company, I really only need one so\nwe can shorten down the backbone routing\n\n65\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.250\ntables and now with IPv6,\nyou almost help eliminate that, right?\n\n66\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you know it's funny, I was\nreading an article, just a side note,\n\n67\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.850\nabout some of the top 20, we'll say\nviolators, but people that haven't\n\n68\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.610\ndone what they really want them to\ndo with the aggregation of routes.\n\n69\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.110\nIn fact some of these companies\nhave gone the opposite way.\n\n70\n00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.750\nAnd my internet service provider,\n\n71\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170\nCox Communications,\nwas one of them on the list.\n\n72\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.350\nIt kind of made me chuckle.\n\n73\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.350\nBut anyway,\nthey'll try to break things up.\n\n74\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.820\nThey don't want to aggregate everything\nfor security reasons, for management\n\n75\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.940\nreasons, sometimes it's more beneficial\nto them to try to segregate things out.\n\n76\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.520\nBut that again,\ndoes add more to the routing.\n\n77\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.245\nSo IPv6 is gonna help with that hopefully\nand when it comes to subnetting,\n\n78\n00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.895\nhonestly I think it's a little\nbit easier to deal with.\n\n79\n00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:03.975\nBecause we're not dealing with that IPv4\naddress, where I've got so many bits for\n\n80\n00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:08.285\nthe network, so many bits for the host,\nand if I want a subnet that address that I\n\n81\n00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:12.965\ngot from the IANA, I've got to borrow\nsome of those host bits and use those to\n\n82\n00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:16.795\nsubnet, which reduces the number of\nhosts that I can have on that subnet.\n\n83\n00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:22.210\nWith IPv6, we've got 16 bits\ndedicated to subnetting, 16 bits.\n\n84\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.650\nNow if we do the math on that,\n\n85\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.630\n2 to the 16th is, Wes, you know\nthat one off the top of your head?\n\n86\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.156\n&gt;&gt; Say it one more time.\n\n87\n00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.350\n&gt;&gt; 2 to the 16th,\nI'll put into the test here.\n\n88\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, 2 to the power of 16.\n\n89\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.125\nLet me see if I've got this right.\n\n90\n00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:36.659\n&gt;&gt; I know you got it.\n\n91\n00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.170\n&gt;&gt; 16 bits, is that 65,535?\n\n92\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.410\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes, it is.\n\n93\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.462\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just making sure there.\n\n94\n00:04:43.462 --> 00:04:45.815\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n95\n00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:49.115\nthat's a lot of subnets\nthat I can work with.\n\n96\n00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.515\nDon't have to worry about\nrunning out of subnets.\n\n97\n00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:55.305\nSo really because those\nfour hexadecimal digits,\n\n98\n00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:59.530\n16 bits are just sitting there to use for\nsubnets.\n\n99\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.920\nI can really just do anything I\nwant with those bits, honestly.\n\n100\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.860\nSo let's take a look I'll show you\nwant I mean and I'll make a little bit\n\n101\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.730\nmore sense out of me saying just,\nyou can do whatever you want with it.\n\n102\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.790\nWell Mike, that doesn't help me.\n\n103\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.500\nSo when we look at an IPv6 address,\nand we looked at this the other day.\n\n104\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.480\nWe know that it's a 128 bits and\n\n105\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.500\nwe're gonna divide it right in the middle\nwith a slash 64 the end of it.\n\n106\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.840\nThe first 64 bits are used for the\nrouting, the global prefixes, the company\n\n107\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.770\nidentification and the subnetting,\nthe last 64 bits are used for the host.\n\n108\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.700\nAnd so, out of the first four groups,\nthe first 64 bits,\n\n109\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.260\nthe last group, and\nI can't really highlight it.\n\n110\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.960\nBut this group right here, that,\n\n111\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.200\nthose are the four hexadecimal\ndigits set aside for subnetting.\n\n112\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.530\nThe first part of this address is my\nglobal prefix that lets the routers know\n\n113\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.890\nthat it's a globally unique\nroutable IPv6 address.\n\n114\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.760\nThen you've got bits that are set\naside for the company ID,\n\n115\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.380\nthis will be assigned to you by the ISP or\nthe provider of the IPv6 address.\n\n116\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.690\nYou'll get a unique identifier for\nyour organization.\n\n117\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.440\nThat's gonna go in here, and\n\n118\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.730\nthen these last four digits of the first\n64 are gonna be set aside for subnetting.\n\n119\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.690\nSo basically these right here are for\nsubnetting.\n\n120\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.830\nSo I can do whatever I want with\nthese bits, however I see fit.\n\n121\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.730\nIf I just need a couple of subnets,\nI can say that those four 0s,\n\n122\n00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.800\nmaybe I wanna do 0001.\n\n123\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.201\nAnd that's it, there's one subnet.\n\n124\n00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.910\n0002, and there's another subnet.\n\n125\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.210\n0003, and there's another subnet.\n\n126\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.300\nAnd I've got 65,000 of\nthese that I can create.\n\n127\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.260\nBecause remember these\nare hexadecimal digits, so\n\n128\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.990\neventually we'll do something like this.\n\n129\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.930\nWe'll do a dot, dot, dot.\n\n130\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.100\nAnd we'll say it goes all the way up to,\nwhat, ffff.\n\n131\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.560\nSo we could go all the way up to that.\n\n132\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.443\nSo that's a little bit\nabout how we've set it up,\n\n133\n00:06:59.443 --> 00:07:04.170\nlet me give you a little case\nstudy that I've got for us here.\n\n134\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.970\nLet me find it IPv6 sub heading,\nhere we go.\n\n135\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.310\nSo let's say, for\n\n136\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.570\nexample we get an address from our\nISP that's this one right here.\n\n137\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.220\nNow remember the db8 is for\n\n138\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.890\ndocumentation, this one wouldn't\nbe used out there on the internet.\n\n139\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.625\nBut 2001 db8 1234::/48.\n\n140\n00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:25.710\nThat's generally what you're gonna get\n\n141\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.770\nwhen you request a block\nof IPv6 addresses is a /48.\n\n142\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.390\nNow, where's that divided?\n\n143\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.700\nIf we look back over here,\nthese right here.\n\n144\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.110\nThese are the first 48 bits.\n\n145\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.040\nAnd again, that leaves the next 16 bits\nall the way up to that 64th bit for\n\n146\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.750\nmy sub netting.\n\n147\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.620\nSo this block is to use for sub netting.\n\n148\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.095\nSo if we take just that block there that\n0000, I think that was too many zeros.\n\n149\n00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:57.412\n0000, and I broke them out, so\nhere's those four hexadecimal digits.\n\n150\n00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:59.951\nThen I converted them to binary,\n\n151\n00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:03.861\ncuz remember each hexadecimal\ndigit is four bits.\n\n152\n00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.819\nAnd so how do I wanna do this?\n\n153\n00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.273\nMaybe I want to do We can do sites.\n\n154\n00:08:08.273 --> 00:08:12.540\nIn this case we're gonna look at sites,\nsubsites and subnets basically.\n\n155\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.770\nSo, let say I'm an organization and\nI wanna break this up.\n\n156\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.020\nAnd I wanna create some sites or\nI can really do like I said,\n\n157\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.040\nI could do whatever I want.\n\n158\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.280\nI could use this entire first octet for\nsites.\n\n159\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.070\nI can do anything I want.\n\n160\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.630\nFor example, let's say that the red,\nI want to use red for my sites and\n\n161\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.410\nthen green for my subsites and\nthen I'll use orange for my subnet.\n\n162\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.090\nSo I'm gonna take the first\ntwo bits all right, and\n\n163\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.220\nI'm going to use those for my sites.\n\n164\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.780\nSo that means I could\ndo 2 to the power of 4.\n\n165\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.460\nI could have oops.\n\n166\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.476\n2 to the power of 2 sorry,\n\n167\n00:08:51.476 --> 00:08:56.400\nequals 2 to the power of 2 because\nthere's two values per place.\n\n168\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.860\nSo I could have four sites and then I'll\nuse the next two bits for sub sites.\n\n169\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.400\nThat means guess how many I can have,\n2 to the power of 2.\n\n170\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.850\nAll right, 4 subsites.\n\n171\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.090\nAnd then for subnets I've got [LAUGH],\n\n172\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.850\nit just makes me giggle, 4, 8,\n12 bits left for the actual subnets.\n\n173\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:23.060\nSo we'll say equals 2 to the power of 12,\nthat's 4,096 subnets.\n\n174\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.340\nSo I could have 4 sites,\nmaybe northeast, northwest,\n\n175\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.816\nsoutheast and southwest, if we were\ndividing up the United States for example.\n\n176\n00:09:31.816 --> 00:09:36.400\nWithin each one of those sites,\nI could have 4 sub sites, so I could take\n\n177\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.280\nthe southeast and I could take these three\nstates up here and divide that up into 4\n\n178\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.562\nand then within each one of those sub\nsites, I could have 4,096 subnets.\n\n179\n00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:51.620\nAll right, probably never going to need\nthat many and don't forget it's not like\n\n180\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:57.450\nwith IPv4 where when I create this I'm\nborrowing from the host I still have,\n\n181\n00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.790\nwe haven't touched the last\n64 bits over here.\n\n182\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:08.560\nI still have 64 bits for\nhosts on each one of those subnets.\n\n183\n00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.690\nDo we ever calculate that out?\n\n184\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:16.031\nWhat is 2 to the 64th, let's just\ntry that, =2 to the power of 64.\n\n185\n00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:21.770\nYeah, it's too big, it's gonna show\nit in scientific notation there.\n\n186\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.820\nIt's a large, large number,\nwe've got 19 0s out behind this thing.\n\n187\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.067\nSo, on each one, all 4,096 subnets\n\n188\n00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:36.980\nper subsite per site can\nhave that many hosts on it.\n\n189\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.310\nRidiculous, right?\n\n190\n00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.140\nWhat if you wanted to have more sites?\n\n191\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.745\nWell, we'll just say,\nlet's use 4 bits for the sites.\n\n192\n00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:50.668\nSo = 2 to the power of 4,\nI could do 4 sites and\n\n193\n00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:55.100\nthen we could use the next 4 for\nsub sites,\n\n194\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:01.649\nwhich again is gonna be the same thing,\n= 2 to the power of 4.\n\n195\n00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.219\nAnd then I'll have only 8 bits\n[LAUGH] left for the host.\n\n196\n00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:07.444\nAgain, makes me giggle,\n= 2 to the power of 8.\n\n197\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.840\nSo I get a 256, right?\n\n198\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.780\nNow the site prefix is gonna\nchange depending on what you're\n\n199\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.970\ntalking about, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.770\nIn other words if I'm\nlooking at the site level,\n\n201\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.510\nwell we already know we got 48 bits\nin front of this address, right.\n\n202\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.720\nWe weren't touching the first 48.\n\n203\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.250\nThat was assigned to us by INA,\nIANA or whomever.\n\n204\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.700\nAnd then we've got the 16 bits we're\nmessing with, right after that 48 bits.\n\n205\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.790\nSo, /48 got us right up until\nthe beginning right to before\n\n206\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:45.310\nthis hexadecimal digit and borrowing two\nmore bits there to use for my sites.\n\n207\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.627\nSo when I'm talking at the site level,\n\n208\n00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:50.726\nthis would be a slash,\nwhat are we looking at there?\n\n209\n00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:55.903\n48, 52.\n\n210\n00:11:55.903 --> 00:11:58.482\nIs that right?\nDid I do that math right?\n\n211\n00:11:58.482 --> 00:11:59.450\nNo I'm sorry, there'd be 50, right?\n\n212\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:05.230\nWe're only borrowing 2 bits from\nthat next hexadecimal digit there.\n\n213\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.935\nSo, which is 4 bits, so\nonly 2, so it'll be 50.\n\n214\n00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.150\n48 + 2 is 50, yeah, so it'll be /50.\n\n215\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.660\nSorry, I had to double check\nmy math in my brain there.\n\n216\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.550\nIf we were talking about the subsite,\nthe prefix would be a /52,\n\n217\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.680\nright, to bring it to right to here to\ninclude these 4 bits in the prefix.\n\n218\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.790\nAnd when we get down to our subnet,\n\n219\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.800\nit would be a /64 to include all\nof these bits in the prefix.\n\n220\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.190\nIn this case, the sites would be a /52,\n\n221\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.690\ncuz we're taking the next 4 bits,\nso 48 + 4 is 52.\n\n222\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.840\nIf we were talking about our\nsubsite level then we would do,\n\n223\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.655\nthere would be another 4, so 52, 56.\n\n224\n00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:51.417\nFor that, again,\nthe subnet would be a /64.\n\n225\n00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:54.720\nSo hopefully you get the idea from that,\nall right.\n\n226\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.570\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now, are you telling me that in\neach one of those 4,096 subnets I can\n\n227\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:05.890\nhave, and I found the number out,\n18 quintillion devices.\n\n228\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.850\nThat is insanity.\n\n229\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Straight insane.\n\n230\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.800\n&gt;&gt; We're not subnetting for\nthe same reasons anymore, right.\n\n231\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.730\nI mean back in our IPv4 days,\nwe subnetted to create contention domains\n\n232\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.810\nto limit the amount of competition\nwe had for network time.\n\n233\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.320\nWhich it still works,\n\n234\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.770\nbut hopefully you're never gonna put\n18 quintillion devices on a subnet.\n\n235\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.190\nBecause it would still be too much\ntraffic on an ethernet based network.\n\n236\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.680\nSo it's really not quite the same there.\n\n237\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.110\nI shouldn't say it's not the same, because\neven though we know we'll never put that\n\n238\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.590\nmany on, we're still creating\nsubnets to make sure that hey,\n\n239\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.900\nall those guys over in that department,\nthey can communicate with each other.\n\n240\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.670\nBut their broadcast traffic isn't\ngonna interfere with ours, or\n\n241\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.620\nanything like that, right?\n\n242\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.920\nSo that's subnetting.\n\n243\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.090\nAgain, this is really a little\nbit of a complex way to do it.\n\n244\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.190\nYou've gotta be a pretty large\norganization to need to divide this up\n\n245\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.590\ninto sites, and then subsites,\nand then subnets.\n\n246\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.080\nAnd you definitely don't have\nto go through all that, right?\n\n247\n00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.900\nRemember what I did over here?\n\n248\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.894\nI could simply take that fourth group,\nand just put a 0001/ 64,\n\n249\n00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:18.470\nand there's a subnet, plain and\nsimple like we did in IPv4 before.\n\n250\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.630\nNo sites, sub sites, subnet,\njust a subnet, right?\n\n251\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:27.750\nAnd then another subnet 2, and another\nsubnet 3, another sub net, 000a, okay.\n\n252\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.390\nYou could have a site for each state,\nyou could have a site for\n\n253\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.510\neach country if you\nwanted to in the world.\n\n254\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.980\nI mean it's really flexible,\n\n255\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.020\nthat's what's cool about this is you can\ndo whatever you need to do with this.\n\n256\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.620\nJust keep in mind if I wanted to do,\n\n257\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.030\nlet's say I wanted to do\ncountry codes more or less.\n\n258\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.750\nWhoops, let me get rid of this.\n\n259\n00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.890\nLet's say that we're in three\ndifferent countries, and\n\n260\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:57.270\nI want to do subnets, but I want each\ncountry to kind of be its own site.\n\n261\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.776\nWell, I could decide, I'm going\nto just say, out of these 4 bits,\n\n262\n00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:05.689\none is going to be for\nthe first country we're in, 001.\n\n263\n00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:06.850\nSo there's one subnet.\n\n264\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.520\nAnd then, same country difference of,\n\n265\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.370\nnow maybe two different\ncities in that same country.\n\n266\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.652\nBut then our other country,\nwe're gonna do 2001.\n\n267\n00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:22.960\nAnd 200 all the way up to f or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n268\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.140\nSo, whatever works best for\nyour organization.\n\n269\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.610\nThat is really what you gonna do.\n\n270\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.400\nAgain, we're not really getting\ninto the logic and the,\n\n271\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.750\nas much as I wanna make sure that you just\nunderstand that with an IPv6 address,\n\n272\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.280\nthere are 16 bits set aside for\nsubnetting.\n\n273\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.010\nWe're not moving a subnet mask\nto borrow bits from those.\n\n274\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.600\nThose four hexadecimal digits,\nthose 16 bits are solely for subnetting.\n\n275\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.050\nThat's what the protocol IPv6,\nthat's in the definition of IPv6.\n\n276\n00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.510\nThose are ours to play with for\nour subnets.\n\n277\n00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.200\n&gt;&gt; Mike I want to bring you to\na thought you said earlier.\n\n278\n00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.352\nYou said with IPv6 today we're not really\nsubnetting from one of the things that we\n\n279\n00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:04.566\nused to subnet it,\nwell we still do subnet.\n\n280\n00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:07.747\nIn IPv4, and one of the things\nyou mentioned was contention.\n\n281\n00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:11.252\nNow, when I think contention,\nthe first thing that comes to mind for\n\n282\n00:16:11.252 --> 00:16:15.790\nme is IPv4 broadcast communications, and\none communication, like you said earlier,\n\n283\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.744\ngoes out to everybody on the network.\n\n284\n00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:19.372\nIf I can talk directly to you,\n\n285\n00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:23.295\nthen that's really saturating my\nnetwork with unnecessary traffic.\n\n286\n00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:26.155\nIs that something that we're gonna\nhave to worry about inside of IPv6?\n\n287\n00:16:26.155 --> 00:16:28.365\nAnd more specifically,\nthe broadcast communications?\n\n288\n00:16:28.365 --> 00:16:29.205\n&gt;&gt; It's really not.\n\n289\n00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:32.646\nOne of the cool things about IPv6 is the\nway it assigns addresses and the fact that\n\n290\n00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:36.102\nyou can have multiple addresses, something\nwe haven't even talked about yet.\n\n291\n00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:39.547\nWith IPv4, you've got a single IP address,\nyou use that for\n\n292\n00:16:39.547 --> 00:16:42.596\nall of your communications,\nwhether its uni-cast,\n\n293\n00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:47.521\nmulti-cast, broadcast, whatever the case\nmay be, you only have one IPv4 address.\n\n294\n00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:49.959\nWith IPv6,\nyou end up with multiple addresses.\n\n295\n00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:53.874\nIf you do an IP config, or an IF\nconfig on your machine right now, and\n\n296\n00:16:53.874 --> 00:16:56.005\nyou're on a network that has IPv6,\n\n297\n00:16:56.005 --> 00:17:00.099\nI should say you're running\nan operating system that is using IPv6.\n\n298\n00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:04.595\nLike our Windows operating systems\nnow are all running ever since what,\n\n299\n00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:08.630\nVista or XP Server VAC 3, but\nVista, it's on by default.\n\n300\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.808\nAnd if you open up a command prompt,\n\n301\n00:17:09.808 --> 00:17:11.434\nin fact, here,\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n302\n00:17:11.434 --> 00:17:13.814\nI'm on Windows 10 machine.\n\n303\n00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:17.900\nI'll open up a little command prompt,\nmake this font a little bit bigger.\n\n304\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.640\nSo everybody out there can see it.\n\n305\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.140\nI didn't make it all that big, but we'll\ndo an IP config, and what you're gonna\n\n306\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.950\nsee is that on my network adaptor,\nwhich is here, all right?\n\n307\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.500\nI have an IPv4 address,\nbut look right above that.\n\n308\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.954\nI have an IPv6 address, all right?\n\n309\n00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:44.281\nNow, it starts with an FE80, and it\ntells me right over here what it is, but\n\n310\n00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:49.050\njust looking at the address, I immediately\nknow FE80 is a link local address.\n\n311\n00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.490\nThis is self generated.\n\n312\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.230\nMy machine came up with\nthis address on its own.\n\n313\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:57.410\nEvery IPv6, every machine that supports\nIPv6, for every network adaptor,\n\n314\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.400\nwill generate a link local address, it's\njust FE80/10, if I remember correctly,\n\n315\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.880\nbut the first 64 bits, it's FE80 and\nthen the rest is all 0s.\n\n316\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.142\nAnd then the last 64 bits are randomly\ngenerated by your machine,\n\n317\n00:18:12.142 --> 00:18:16.497\nmuch like a Pippa in the old days,\nback in the IPv4 days, all right.\n\n318\n00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:20.468\nThis is what's called a link local, and\nthis is what your machine will use when\n\n319\n00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:23.850\nit's talking to other machines\non the same network, right?\n\n320\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.270\nBecause they're local,\nI don't have to route to get to it.\n\n321\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.300\nIf they're on my subnet,\nI can use this address.\n\n322\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.100\nSo your machine will end up,\nI don't have a global address.\n\n323\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.139\nWe're not providing IPv6\naddresses here in the studio, but\n\n324\n00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:38.302\nI can talk locally with another\nmachine that's running IPv6.\n\n325\n00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:42.928\nAnd so to get back to Wes' question there\non that global address, I don't have to\n\n326\n00:18:42.928 --> 00:18:48.340\nworry about broadcast traffic, because\nIPv6 doesn't do broadcasts that way.\n\n327\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.825\nWhat we'll do is we'll send out a message\non our link local address to all the other\n\n328\n00:18:52.825 --> 00:18:56.415\ndevices that are on the same link as us,\nso they'll all get that.\n\n329\n00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:59.329\nSo I don't know if that\nreally answers your question.\n\n330\n00:18:59.329 --> 00:19:02.290\nIt doesn't really do\na broadcast in the same way.\n\n331\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:08.410\nIt doesn't send it out to 255.255.255.255,\nit's anybody that's out there.\n\n332\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.680\nIt sends it to the local address for\nthat subnet.\n\n333\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now, you've really thrown a rock\nin the com pond of understanding here and\n\n334\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.250\nthere's ripples.\n\n335\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.370\nSo you're telling me that with IPv6,\nit's smart enough to know that if I said,\n\n336\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.060\nlocal traffic,\nI'm gonna send it out this IP address.\n\n337\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.240\nBut in the case of where\nwe've got a global,\n\n338\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.710\nif you guys don't remember that,\ngo back and\n\n339\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.390\ncheck that episode where he talked\nabout the different type of addresses.\n\n340\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.800\nBut if I have a global unicast address,\nthe computer and\n\n341\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.600\nIPv6 are smart enough to know,\nuse that to route it off my network, but\n\n342\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.660\nif I'm talking local,\nyou're gonna use this address.\n\n343\n00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.990\nSo I guess the confusion for me now is\nyou can have more than one address, and\n\n344\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.450\nthe computer and IPv6 are smart enough\nto know which one to use at what time.\n\n345\n00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and generate it themselves.\n\n346\n00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:50.243\n[CROSSTALK] They come out with\ntheir own unique, in fact,\n\n347\n00:19:50.243 --> 00:19:52.922\nhere's another cool thing, right,\nthe global unique address.\n\n348\n00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:56.023\nWith IPv4,\nwe had to make sure we went to IANA,\n\n349\n00:19:56.023 --> 00:20:01.080\nthat we got that block of addresses, so\nthat way, they knew those were mine.\n\n350\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.120\nThey were in use,\nthey wouldn't give it to anybody else.\n\n351\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.560\nThey were unique for me.\n\n352\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.717\nWith IPv6, when you go to the IANA,\nremember what I said, you get,\n\n353\n00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:13.940\nwhere's my little tab there,\nyou're gonna get something like this.\n\n354\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:19.480\nJust the prefix, all right,\nnothing about what the last 64 bits.\n\n355\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.780\nAnd so on your network,\nwhat you'll do is you'll run, typically,\n\n356\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.720\nyour router runs an advertisement.\n\n357\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.700\nAnd so all of your devices on your network\nwill talk to your router and say hey,\n\n358\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.940\nis there an IPv6 advertisement?\n\n359\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:37.122\nAnd the router's gonna say, yes,\nhere's our company's prefix,\n\n360\n00:20:37.122 --> 00:20:42.406\n2001:dba:1234/64, all right, or 0000/64.\n\n361\n00:20:42.406 --> 00:20:47.190\nAnd then what your node is gonna do is\ngenerate the last 64 bits on its own.\n\n362\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.477\nSo, and then it plugs them together and\nit's got a 128 bit address.\n\n363\n00:20:50.477 --> 00:20:55.558\nSo, in the end, your computer's\ngenerating its own globally unique,\n\n364\n00:20:55.558 --> 00:20:57.400\nroutable IPv6 address.\n\n365\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.800\nI didn't have to do anything.\n\n366\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.070\nAll I had to do was set up\nthe router with the advertisement.\n\n367\n00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.902\nThat is pretty impressive.\n\n368\n00:21:02.902 --> 00:21:05.363\nDHCP can also handle IPv6.\n\n369\n00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:09.595\nAnd if we wanna get specific,\nI can make sure that Wes'\n\n370\n00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:14.640\nmachine gets 0000000000000001, right?\n\n371\n00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.313\nI mean, I can do that with DHCP and IPv6.\n\n372\n00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:20.369\nBut typically,\nwe're just letting the nodes\n\n373\n00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:25.160\ngenerate their own last 64 bits as\nways to check and see if it's in use.\n\n374\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.335\nBut the odds of a collision are so\nsmall because with 64 bits,\n\n375\n00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:30.305\nyou said it was what?\n\n376\n00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:31.874\n&gt;&gt; It was 18 quintillion.\n\n377\n00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:32.478\n&gt;&gt; 18 quintillion.\n\n378\n00:21:32.478 --> 00:21:34.301\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not gonna try the rest\nof the number, we'll stop at there.\n\n379\n00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:35.395\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n380\n00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.795\nit's like I'm pretty sure\nthe number's gonna be unique.\n\n381\n00:21:37.795 --> 00:21:39.932\nNobody else has generated\nthe same number as me.\n\n382\n00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.299\nSo IPv6 has a lot of advantages.\n\n383\n00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:46.724\nAnother one that we haven't talked\nabout is built-in security, right?\n\n384\n00:21:46.724 --> 00:21:51.357\nIPv6 has IP sec built into it.\n\n385\n00:21:51.357 --> 00:21:54.643\nAnd you might say, well, Mike,\nwe've had IP sec for a little while,\n\n386\n00:21:54.643 --> 00:21:55.850\nwe can use it with IPv4.\n\n387\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.480\nSo nothing special there,\nwhy are you getting excited?\n\n388\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.180\nWell, because with IPv4, when it was\noriginally developed back in the 70s and\n\n389\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.800\n80s at Arp and Ed, their security\nwasn't in the forefront, right?\n\n390\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.600\nIt wasn't what we were thinking about,\nso IPv6 was added later on,\n\n391\n00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.290\nmuch, much later actually.\n\n392\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.880\nAnd it was kinda shoehorned in to IPv4.\n\n393\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:23.230\nWhich works, but not nearly as efficient\nwhen you take an IP protocol like IPv6 and\n\n394\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.930\nyou design it with IP sec in mind.\n\n395\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.422\nSo it's built into the actual\nprotocol security,\n\n396\n00:22:29.422 --> 00:22:32.130\nIP sec,\nthe ability to encrypt the payload.\n\n397\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.530\nThe ability to do authentication\nheader and verify\n\n398\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.130\nthat the packet hasn't been modified\naccidentally or maliciously in transit.\n\n399\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.600\nAll that's built into IPv6.\n\n400\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.290\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm looking at a router, and\nI don't know time frames here, but\n\n401\n00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.640\nlet's just theoretically say,\nmaybe it's a 20 year old.\n\n402\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.831\nAnd you probably wouldn't\nwanna use it anyways.\n\n403\n00:22:48.831 --> 00:22:53.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it says it's IPv4 compliant,\n\n404\n00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:58.000\nthen it might or might not support IP sec.\n\n405\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.860\nHowever, if it's IPv6 compliant,\nthen they're required to have some\n\n406\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.802\nmechanisms that you can implement IP\nsec and then secure that traffic.\n\n407\n00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:09.303\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit has to in order to be IPv6 support,\n\n408\n00:23:09.303 --> 00:23:13.771\nit has to support IP sec, so\na lot of really cool things with IPv6.\n\n409\n00:23:13.771 --> 00:23:17.800\nWe're seeing,\nit's slowly being rolled out.\n\n410\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.320\nI know here we had IPv6 day,\nit's been a little while now,\n\n411\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.860\nwhere they tried to shut down IPv4 and\njust see how many things wouldn't work.\n\n412\n00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.440\nAnd it was quite a few, I mean,\nit didn't go all that well.\n\n413\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.511\nBut it's a slow process,\nand we think, well, why?\n\n414\n00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:35.350\nI mean, at my house, for example,\nthe router I've got supports IPv6.\n\n415\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.050\nAll the machines on my\nnetwork support IPv6.\n\n416\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.837\nBut my problem is my DVD\nplayer doesn't support IPv6,\n\n417\n00:23:43.837 --> 00:23:48.405\nand my game consoles don't support IPv6.\n\n418\n00:23:48.405 --> 00:23:50.399\nSo if I turn off IPv4 in my home network,\n\n419\n00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:53.500\nthose machines are no longer\ngonna be able to connect.\n\n420\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.900\nYou go globally, and\nyou think there's organizations that have\n\n421\n00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.330\nto upgrade to everything to support IPv6,\nit's gonna cost them lots of money.\n\n422\n00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.190\nThere's routers and backbone routers that\n\n423\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.350\nare supported by companies that are not\nfor profit, or things like that where they\n\n424\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.520\ndon't have the money to just all\nof a sudden go, IPv6 is here.\n\n425\n00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.660\nLet's go out and spend all this money and\nupgrade everything all at once.\n\n426\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.870\nIt's a slow roll out process.\n\n427\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.753\nYou'll probably see,\nI don't know, check your ISP.\n\n428\n00:24:20.753 --> 00:24:23.950\nTry turning off IPv4 on your home machine.\n\n429\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.620\nSee if you're getting\nan advertisement first.\n\n430\n00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.896\nDo an IP config, and\nsee if you're getting a global prefix,\n\n431\n00:24:28.896 --> 00:24:31.025\nsomething that starts with a 2 or a 3.\n\n432\n00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:35.473\nRemember, the first three bits\nare set aside for that, so try it.\n\n433\n00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:39.217\nTurn off IPv4 on your home network and\nsee what happens,\n\n434\n00:24:39.217 --> 00:24:43.350\nbut hopefully in the next few years,\nit's gonna be a decade.\n\n435\n00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:48.320\nI don't know, I'm just guessing, I'm not\na fortune teller when it comes to this,\n\n436\n00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.382\nbut slowly over time, IPv4 will be\ntransitioned out completely and\n\n437\n00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:53.726\nreplaced with IPv6.\n\n438\n00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.760\n&gt;&gt; And I think of things like third world\ncountries, up-and-coming countries,\n\n439\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.601\nI have the benefits,\nwe live here in the States.\n\n440\n00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:02.333\nMaybe some of you are watching are in the\nStates, or maybe in some of the European\n\n441\n00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:05.917\nnations and stuff that have been on\nthe advancement of these technologies.\n\n442\n00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:09.284\nI can only imagine that you have some\nthird world countries that are like, man,\n\n443\n00:25:09.284 --> 00:25:12.210\nwe finally got Internet, and\nnow we've got to upgrade everything.\n\n444\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.630\nSo I can see why finances and\n\n445\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.150\njust the movement of technology might\nnot be as fast in those places.\n\n446\n00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.190\nNow Mike, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n447\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.904\nBut before we sign out, do you have any\nadditional advice you'd like to give in\n\n448\n00:25:23.904 --> 00:25:25.934\ngeneral about networking fundamentals,\n\n449\n00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:28.432\nor maybe even additional\ninformation about IPv6?\n\n450\n00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:31.706\n&gt;&gt; I would say play around with it,\ntake a look at it.\n\n451\n00:25:31.706 --> 00:25:36.390\nLike I said, experiment on your home\nnetwork, do some IP config or IF config.\n\n452\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.720\nSee if you've got IPv6 there.\n\n453\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.680\nThe main thing is, don't be scared of it,\nit's a much bigger number, but\n\n454\n00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.130\nin the end, binary is binary.\n\n455\n00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.200\nDoing the way we subnet,\n\n456\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.030\nit's still the same, binary math,\nwe're not doing it quite the same way.\n\n457\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:58.690\nBut in the end, it's just a bigger\naddress base, and because it's\n\n458\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:04.160\nmostly automated, it's actually easier to\nwork with than IPv4, in my humble opinion.\n\n459\n00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.512\nBecause I can set it, set my advertisement\nup with my company prefix, and\n\n460\n00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:11.340\nthen let the nodes do all\nthe rest of the work themselves.\n\n461\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.699\nWe can still statically\nmap nodes with IPv6.\n\n462\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.010\nSo just start getting used to it, because\nit's gonna be here sooner than you think,\n\n463\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.880\nyou're gonna have to use it.\n\n464\n00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that's a wealth of\nknowledge on

00:00:12.949\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to\n\n4\n00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.115\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.831\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.120\nwe're continuing through our\nGIAC security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.950\nAnd we're going to be talking\nabout a service right now,\n\n8\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.610\nthat is one of the most important\nservices out there in the Internet,\n\n9\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.990\nthat lets us find just about everything.\n\n10\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.600\nAnd joining us in the studios\nis none other than Mike Roger.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.510\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.570\nThanks for having me, and you're right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.340\nOne of my favorite topics, and I know I\nsay that about several different topics,\n\n15\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.940\nbut it is, it's definitely up there in\nmy top 5 because DNS is, as Wes said,\n\n16\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.570\njust an extremely important service.\n\n17\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.340\nIt really allows our networks\nto function like they do.\n\n18\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.600\nWithout it, we'd have a difficult time.\n\n19\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.170\nI mean, it wouldn't be impossible but\nit would be much more difficult.\n\n20\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.870\nWhy is that?\n\n21\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.970\nWell, let's talk about what DNS is, what\nit does for us that makes it so important.\n\n22\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.960\nFirst, let's define the acronym, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.200\nDNS is Domain Name System and\nthe idea behind DNS is.\n\n24\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.500\nThis is, what's a good way to say this?\n\n25\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.290\nComputers deal with numbers, ones and\nzeros is really all they care about.\n\n26\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.630\nThey don't care what you call your\ncomputer, they wanna know it's IP address,\n\n27\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.820\nfor example, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.180\nAnd we've seen that,\nwe write it in decimal or hex, but\n\n29\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.510\nit gets broken down to ones and\nzeros in the end.\n\n30\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.510\nSo computers deal with numbers, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.570\nBut as humans, we deal with names\nmuch better than we do with numbers.\n\n32\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.040\nAnd I can give you a great example,\nlook at your phone, right?\n\n33\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.180\nIf I go to call my father,\nI don't know about you Wes,\n\n34\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.600\nbut if I need to call my dad, I go to\nmy contacts, and I look him up by name.\n\n35\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.070\nThere's dad and I touch him,\nI don't know his phone number.\n\n36\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.870\nI honestly don't even know my own father's\nphone number, but he's in my contacts.\n\n37\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.020\nI can look him up by name, got all\nthese contacts that I look up by name.\n\n38\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.930\nI don't need to memorize everybody's phone\nnumber, cuz I've got a system on my phone,\n\n39\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.210\nmy contact app, that when I tell\nit what name I'm trying to call,\n\n40\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.790\nit can look it up in its little table.\n\n41\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.280\nAnd say okay,\nthat name is this phone number, and\n\n42\n00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920\nit can call that phone number, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.930\nAnd now I can connect to my dad,\nand we can talk.\n\n44\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.090\nWell DNS is doing the same thing for us\nwhen it comes to resources on our network.\n\n45\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.240\nIt allows us to connect to resources\nby name, because names are easier for\n\n46\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.250\nus to remember.\n\n47\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.290\nEven though in the end,\nit's all done by IP address.\n\n48\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.880\nWhen you connect to your favorite search\nengine or your favorite shopping site,\n\n49\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.180\nwhat do you type in\nthe address bar up there?\n\n50\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.080\nYou're not typing 12.1.47.142, right?\n\n51\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.281\nYou're typing www.google.com or\n\n52\n00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.750\nwww.newegg.com, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n53\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380\nWell your computer can\nnot connect to a name,\n\n54\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.180\nthere's no way it can connect to a name.\n\n55\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.940\nSo what it has to do is take that name\nyou've typed in and somehow resolve it,\n\n56\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.259\nlook it up and figure out what the IP\naddress is for www.google.com.\n\n57\n00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.207\nThat means somewhere there's\nthis list of names and\n\n58\n00:02:55.207 --> 00:03:00.040\nIP addresses, that it can look it up in,\nand figure out what the IP address is.\n\n59\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.550\nAnd that's what DNS does.\n\n60\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.200\nDNS is our phone book for our computers.\n\n61\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.690\nIt's a mapping of host names, fully\nqualified domain names to be specific,\n\n62\n00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.950\nfully qualified domain names,\nor FQDMs, to IP addresses.\n\n63\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.490\nSo when you type that in, what's happening\nin the background is your computer is\n\n64\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.470\nsending out a query, and a query, or\na DNS query is just a question that's\n\n65\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.480\ngiven to a DNS server, says hey, my user's\ntrying to connect to www.google.com.\n\n66\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690\nWhat the heck is the IP address of that?\n\n67\n00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.870\nYour server, or\nthat DNS server that you're talking to,\n\n68\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.480\nis gonna go through a series of\nsteps to locate that name and\n\n69\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.670\nfind that IP address and\nthen return it to your machine.\n\n70\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.460\nAnd your browser magically\ngoes to www.google.com.\n\n71\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.830\nThat's what DNS is all about.\n\n72\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.970\nAnd without it,\ncould I still connect to Google?\n\n73\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.170\nAbsolutely.\n\n74\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.760\nIf I know the IP address, right.\n\n75\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.140\nYou can try it.\n\n76\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.750\nPing something.\n\n77\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.710\nOpen up a command prompt, or here.\n\n78\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.380\nI say try it,\nwhy don't I try it and show you.\n\n79\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.190\nHow about that?\n\n80\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.110\nLet me open up a command prompt here,\non my machine.\n\n81\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.040\nAll right, so first let me make\nthis a little bit bigger so\n\n82\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.210\nit's gonna be easier for\nmy old eyes to see.\n\n83\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.900\nWe'll bump that up and change my layout so\nit still fits on the screen.\n\n84\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.650\nSomething like that,\nhopefully it will work, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.830\nI don't think you guys can see out there.\n\n86\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.890\nI'm gonna ping Google,\nif I could spell it .com.\n\n87\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.240\nAnd I'm not really worried about the pings\nas much as what's happening here.\n\n88\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.770\nI typed in a name, computers cannot\nconnect to a name, they can't ping a name,\n\n89\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.800\nso my computer had to take that name I\ntyped in, and turn it into an IP Address.\n\n90\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.320\nSo it used DNS to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.570\nWell now I've got the IP Address\nof Google, so let's do this.\n\n92\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.330\nLet me open up a browser.\n\n93\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.323\nWe'll switch to a different page, MSN.com.\n\n94\n00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:58.049\nAnd let's see what happens if\nI go to my address bar and\n\n95\n00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:03.261\ntype in 4.59.90.247.\n\n96\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.810\nNow look it there.\n\n97\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.760\nI went to Google.\n\n98\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.020\nSo by typing that ip address\nI was able to get to it.\n\n99\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.030\nSo the point to that little exercise\nwas you can get by without DNS.\n\n100\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.230\nIf you know the ip address of every\nresource you want to connect to.\n\n101\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.770\nBut therein lies the rub.\n\n102\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.810\nHow many IP Addresses do you know?\n\n103\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.930\nRight?\nDo you know the IP Address of Newegg,\n\n104\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.210\nFacebook or\nwhatever other website you wanna go to.\n\n105\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.430\nOf your mail server of your\ncompany's Internet portal.\n\n106\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.830\nWell those are all members\nthat now I have to memorize.\n\n107\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.340\nWith DNS, I can remember google means\nsearch and new egg means computer parts.\n\n108\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.380\nEasy for me.\n\n109\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.780\nI can't remember that google has 4 dots,\nI can't even remember\n\n110\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.744\ntyping it in 30 seconds ago,\nI'm going to have to look again for\n\n111\n00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.920\nthat 59.90.47 that's one of their many,\nmany IP Addresses.\n\n112\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.470\nSo, the point is DNS\nmakes it much easier for\n\n113\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.610\nus because we can type in\nfriendly human readable names and\n\n114\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.180\nin the background DNS can convert that\ninto an IP Address and we can connect.\n\n115\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.440\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, is this something that\nwe have to set up if we're gonna\n\n116\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.160\nbe working with our networks?\n\n117\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.090\nIs this something we're\ngonna have to set up, and\n\n118\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.790\nis there a certain level of infrastructure\nthat we might need to be aware of,\n\n119\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.610\nto kind of understand the ins and\nouts of what's going on here?\n\n120\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.660\n&gt;&gt; There definitely is, and\nin this particular series,\n\n121\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.390\nwe're not getting super in depth into DNS.\n\n122\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.675\nWe've got some other shows in our library.\n\n123\n00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:22.580\nWe definitely cover that in our\nserver classes and things like that.\n\n124\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.370\nWe've got a DNS tech skills\nshow that you can check out.\n\n125\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.060\nFor GIAC and for specifically\nif I can say that the GSEB exam.\n\n126\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.280\nThey want a high level understanding\nof the DNS architecture.\n\n127\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.340\nSo, we just need to understand the big\npieces of DNS and how it works.\n\n128\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.680\nSo, lets talk about it in a general way.\n\n129\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.350\nSo we've said that DNS is\nbasically a phone book.\n\n130\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.700\nOne of the cool things about DNS\nis how incredibly scalable it is.\n\n131\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.730\nThe Internet could\ndouble in size tomorrow,\n\n132\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.620\nand in some cases it almost does,\nit seems like.\n\n133\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.000\nAnd DNS would keep on trucking,\nit wouldn't even skip a beat.\n\n134\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.740\nIt's really an amazingly\nwell thought-out plan.\n\n135\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.320\nIt's just organized.\n\n136\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.660\nDNS is a what we call a distributed,\nhierarchical database, all right,\n\n137\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.980\nwhich means that it's distributed.\n\n138\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.550\nThere's not just one server out there\nthat hosts all this information.\n\n139\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.610\nIt's distributed and it's hierarchical.\n\n140\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.250\nThere's different levels,\nit's like a pyramid if you will almost.\n\n141\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.130\nSo let's start locally and\nthen we're gonna jump to the top and\n\n142\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.900\nwork our way down of this pyramid.\n\n143\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.120\nSo first of all, in your organization,\nyou're responsible for\n\n144\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.010\nyour own computer's names and\nIP Addresses.\n\n145\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.390\nIn other words, what that means is as\nan organization like ITProTV here,\n\n146\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.780\nwe are gonna run our own DNS server,\nall right.\n\n147\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.440\nNow when I say you're responsible,\n\n148\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.250\nyou might run it in house,\nthis might be out in the cloud.\n\n149\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.570\nThis might be through a third party\nprovider that's hosting your DNS\n\n150\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.350\ninformation for you.\n\n151\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.810\nBut you are responsible.\n\n152\n00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.343\nWhether you pay somebody to do it or\nyou do it yourself,\n\n153\n00:07:55.343 --> 00:07:58.327\nyour organization is gonna\nmaintain your own DNS information.\n\n154\n00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:02.036\nSo for all the different devices\non our network here at ITProTV,\n\n155\n00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:03.420\nthere's a DNS server.\n\n156\n00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.806\nThat hosts what's called a zone,\na portion of the namespace,\n\n157\n00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:10.966\nfor all those devices\nthat end in itpro.tv.\n\n158\n00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:14.710\nLike my computer's name\nis mikeslaptop.itpro.tv.\n\n159\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.527\nWes's laptop, I don't know what\nit's called, deathstar.itpro.tv.\n\n160\n00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:24.895\nSo all those computers,\nall those devices that end in itpro.tv.\n\n161\n00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:27.451\nI've got a server that has a zone file.\n\n162\n00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:32.210\nAnd in there are all those names and\nall their IP addresses.\n\n163\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.210\nSo if I'm looking for anything on my\nnetwork, I can talk to our DNS server.\n\n164\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.040\nAnd I can say,\nwhat's the IP address of Wes's laptop?\n\n165\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.340\nIt can look it up and it can find it.\n\n166\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.760\nSo each organization is gonna do that.\n\n167\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.494\nAnd this is why I say the Internet\ncould double tomorrow.\n\n168\n00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.815\nWe could have hundreds of\nthousands of new companies.\n\n169\n00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:53.742\nAnd the DNS infrastructure really doesn't\nsee that big of a workload increase.\n\n170\n00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:57.833\nBecause all those new companies\nare running their own DNS servers,\n\n171\n00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:00.380\nhosting their portion of the namespace.\n\n172\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.741\nSo far, we've got our own\nDNS server with our names.\n\n173\n00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:06.196\nSo if I need to look up any\nother device on our network,\n\n174\n00:09:06.196 --> 00:09:09.640\nI can talk to my DNS server and\nI can get that IP address.\n\n175\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.030\nBut I sometimes need to connect to\nresources that aren't part of my network,\n\n176\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.070\nlike Google or Microsoft or Technet.\n\n177\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.517\nOr in my off time, we start going to\nNewegg and to other places like that.\n\n178\n00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:24.390\nAnd those are outside my organization.\n\n179\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.660\nAnd Newegg has their own DNS server\nwith all the names of their devices and\n\n180\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.200\ntheir IP addresses.\n\n181\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.220\nMicrosoft has their own DNS server.\n\n182\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.260\nMy DNS server doesn't know\nanything about www.microsoft.com.\n\n183\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.197\nIt doesn't end in itpro.tv.\n\n184\n00:09:39.197 --> 00:09:42.060\nI maintain my own little\nportion of the namespace.\n\n185\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.600\nMicrosoft has their DNS servers that\nhandle their portion of the namespace.\n\n186\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.150\nSo if I wanna connect\nto www.microsoft.com,\n\n187\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.290\nwhat I really need to do is talk\nto Microsoft's DNS servers.\n\n188\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.320\nCuz my DNS server is not\ngonna know the answer.\n\n189\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.230\nSo then the question becomes,\n\n190\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.430\nhow do I find out the IP address\nof Microsoft's DNS server?\n\n191\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.260\nBecause the only way I can\nconnect to it is by IP address.\n\n192\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.675\nSo how do I find it?\n\n193\n00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:15.950\nAnd that's where that distributed\nhierarchical structure comes into play.\n\n194\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.140\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nwe'll see what I mean by that.\n\n195\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.890\nSo here's my organization down\nhere in the bottom right.\n\n196\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.562\nI've got my little DNS server,\nitpro.tv DNS.\n\n197\n00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:31.096\nAnd so nodes here on my network can\nfind other nodes on my network by\n\n198\n00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:33.083\ntalking to this DNS server.\n\n199\n00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:37.510\nAnd it's going to give them the IP\naddress and they can communicate.\n\n200\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.960\nBut if I wanna go to a resource\nover here on Microsoft,\n\n201\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.280\nthen I'm gonna need to find\nMicrosoft's DNS server.\n\n202\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.000\nOr if I wanna go to Contoso,\nI need to talk to Contoso's DNS server.\n\n203\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.190\nSo the way this works is your node\ndoesn't actually do the work.\n\n204\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.750\nLike if this was my laptop here\non the bottom right, my client,\n\n205\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.054\nmy node is not going to be the one that\nactually looks the information up.\n\n206\n00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:02.216\nHe's gonna send a query\nto my DNS server and say,\n\n207\n00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:05.467\nwhat's the IP address\nof www.microsoft.com?\n\n208\n00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:07.186\nWell, my DNS server doesn't know.\n\n209\n00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:11.490\nBecause he only handles\nnames that end in itpro.tv.\n\n210\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.580\nBut what he does know is how to find\nthe very top of the DNS infrastructure.\n\n211\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.095\nAnd that is known as the root.\n\n212\n00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.915\nAt the very top of our pyramid,\n\n213\n00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:25.045\nof our hierarchical infrastructure,\nthere's root DNS servers.\n\n214\n00:11:25.045 --> 00:11:29.385\nThese are the big bad boys\nthat sit atop the DNS pyramid,\n\n215\n00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:31.155\nif you will, or that hierarchy.\n\n216\n00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:35.960\nNow, the root servers\ndo not know the answer\n\n217\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.290\nof what is the IP address\nof www.microsoft.com.\n\n218\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.830\nThere is no one server that knows\nabout every name and every IP address.\n\n219\n00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.620\nIt just wouldn't work.\n\n220\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.620\nIt would not be scalable.\n\n221\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.150\nJust think about your phone systems.\n\n222\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.135\nI live here in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n223\n00:11:51.135 --> 00:11:53.850\nAnd I can go get a phone book for\nGainesville, Florida.\n\n224\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.200\nAnd I can look up any name\nthat's part of Gainesville.\n\n225\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.470\nBut in there, there's no numbers for\nTampa or Jacksonville.\n\n226\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.660\nIf I wanted a phone book that\nhandled the entire state of Florida,\n\n227\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.970\nit'd be a little thick.\n\n228\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.120\nWhat if I wanted a phone book that\nhandled the entire United States?\n\n229\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.300\nI couldn't pick it up.\n\n230\n00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.942\nAnd trying to look up a name in there,\nit would be near impossible.\n\n231\n00:12:11.942 --> 00:12:15.350\nImagine a phone book that had every\nname and number in the world.\n\n232\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.804\nIt just wouldn't be feasible.\n\n233\n00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:18.660\nIt wouldn't work, and\nit's the same thing with DNS.\n\n234\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.550\nThere is no one server that maintains\nevery single name and IP address.\n\n235\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.340\nThey've divided it up into these\nlittle chunks of responsibility\n\n236\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.250\nto make it scalable,\nto make it very responsive.\n\n237\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.821\nSo the root at the very top,\nlike I said, that is the very top.\n\n238\n00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:40.120\nUnderneath the root, we have what\nwe call our top level domains.\n\n239\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.842\nThese are ones that you're familiar with,\nwhether you know it or not.\n\n240\n00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:47.267\n.com, .gov, .biz, .edu, .au,\n\n241\n00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:52.090\n.tv, all those last part extensions.\n\n242\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.530\nEach one of those is a top level domain.\n\n243\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.740\nAnd ICANN or IANA, I can never remember\nwho's responsible for that now cuz\n\n244\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.310\nit's changed recently, is responsible for\ncreating new ones as they see fit.\n\n245\n00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:10.825\nYears ago, if anybody goes back,\nthere wasn't .tv and .me and .party.\n\n246\n00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:16.333\nIt was basically just .com, .biz,\n.gov, .edu and .net, I think.\n\n247\n00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.172\nThose were the big ones that we had.\n\n248\n00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:22.794\nBut they keep adding more and more because\nwe were starting to run out of names.\n\n249\n00:13:22.794 --> 00:13:26.741\nThere was only so many names you\ncould create that ended in .com.\n\n250\n00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:29.850\nSo they create additional\ntop level domains.\n\n251\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.354\nThese are maintained by\norganizations out there.\n\n252\n00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:39.619\nIt's not a company like Microsoft or\nITProTV that maintains these.\n\n253\n00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.983\nI wanna say that not all\nof them are not for profit.\n\n254\n00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:45.410\nBut they're global organizations,\ntypically, that maintain these.\n\n255\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd give you one quick one off\nthe top of my head just because I had to\n\n256\n00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:48.797\nlook it up the other day.\n\n257\n00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:51.610\nIt's funny that you mentioned that,\nit's Verisign.\n\n258\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.980\nVerisign is one, and\nthey're a major company guys.\n\n259\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.160\nAs you progress through your IT career,\nyou'll hear about them.\n\n260\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.140\nThey do a lot of things, but\nI was really surprised to find out.\n\n261\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.833\nI think they're in control of .com and\n.tv right now.\n\n262\n00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.705\nWhich are some of the big\nones that you're mentioning.\n\n263\n00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:08.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, so\nyou got organizations like that,\n\n264\n00:14:08.022 --> 00:14:11.210\nthat are maintaining these\ntop level DNS servers.\n\n265\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.430\nSo let me explain the way this works.\n\n266\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.255\nSo what the root does, again, the root\ndoesn't know all the details about\n\n267\n00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.328\nindividual machines and IP addresses.\n\n268\n00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:21.800\nBut it's too much to have one big list.\n\n269\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800\nSo what do we do?\n\n270\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.094\nWe take all the names out there.\n\n271\n00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:27.129\nAnd we divide them up by\nthat top level domain.\n\n272\n00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:31.710\nAnything that's a .com name can\nbe handled by this guy over here.\n\n273\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.207\nIf it's .gov name, by this guy over here.\n\n274\n00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:38.020\n.net DNS servers, .tv DNS servers.\n\n275\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.240\nSo when my client queries for\nwww.microsoft.com,\n\n276\n00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.120\nhe sends it to my DNS server.\n\n277\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.990\nMy DNS server doesn't know.\n\n278\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.592\nSo he goes all the way out to the root.\n\n279\n00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:51.965\nAnd says, hey, my user is trying\nto find www.microsoft.com.\n\n280\n00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:53.830\nDo you know the IP address?\n\n281\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.650\nThe root says, I don't.\n\n282\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.760\nBut what I do know is the IP\naddress of the .com DNS server.\n\n283\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.800\nSince the name you're looking up ends in\n.com, why don't you go check with him?\n\n284\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.790\nThis is known as a referral\nto another DNS server.\n\n285\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.430\nSo all the root has to do is know how\nto find the top level DNS servers,\n\n286\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.110\nthe top level domain DNS servers.\n\n287\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.037\nAll this guy has to do is know\nhow to find these guys here.\n\n288\n00:15:20.037 --> 00:15:21.460\nAnd, of course, there's more of them.\n\n289\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.920\nI didn't draw out .party and\n.tv and all that fun stuff.\n\n290\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.690\nBut that's really all\nthe root does is point you to\n\n291\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.910\nthe good starting point there.\n\n292\n00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.968\nSo the root server responds back\nto my DNS server at itpro.tv.\n\n293\n00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:37.971\nAnd says,\nI don't know what www.microsoft.com is.\n\n294\n00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.100\nBut I do know the DNS server\nthat handles the .com names.\n\n295\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.450\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n296\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.230\nHere's his IP address.\n\n297\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.038\nSo my DNS server says, thank you, Mr.\nRoot, I appreciate it.\n\n298\n00:15:47.038 --> 00:15:49.064\nAnd he goes and talks to the .com server.\n\n299\n00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:54.000\nAnd says, hey, my user is trying\nto find www.microsoft.com.\n\n300\n00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.951\nWhat's the IP address of that server?\n\n301\n00:15:55.951 --> 00:16:00.676\nWell, .com server actually doesn't know\nthe IP address of every machine that\n\n302\n00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:01.599\nends in .com.\n\n303\n00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:06.610\nWhat he does know is how to find\nall the DNS servers that handle\n\n304\n00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:12.690\nthe second level or what we call\nthe second level of DNS domain names.\n\n305\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.350\nAnd that's not the word I want,\nthe second level domains I should say,\n\n306\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.699\nhe knows how to find them.\n\n307\n00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:20.271\nHe knows where the microsoft.com\nDNS server is,\n\n308\n00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:24.900\nhe knows where the google.com DNS server\nis, he knows the IP address of these guys.\n\n309\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.080\nHe knows the newegg.com's DNS server's\nIP address, so if you're looking for\n\n310\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.950\na name that ends in .com,\nyou go check with him.\n\n311\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.928\nHe doesn't know the answer but\n\n312\n00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:37.361\nhe can again refer you to\nthe appropriate DNS server.\n\n313\n00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:41.845\nNow, if the name I was looking for\nended in a .gov, then the root would\n\n314\n00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:47.040\nof given me the IP address of the .gov\nDNS server, top level DNS server.\n\n315\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.962\nAnd I would have asked him and he wouldn't\nof known the individual IP address, but\n\n316\n00:16:51.962 --> 00:16:56.972\nhe knows who handles dmv.gov, right, and\nhe can point me to the right DNS server.\n\n317\n00:16:56.972 --> 00:17:02.710\nSo, in this case the .com server says, I\ndon't the IP address of www.microsoft.com.\n\n318\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.973\nBut I do know the IP address\nof microsoft.com's DNS server,\n\n319\n00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:07.745\nwhy don't you go check with him?\n\n320\n00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:12.238\nSends the IP address back to my DNS\nserver, my DNS server then says, okay\n\n321\n00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:17.650\nthank you very much .com server, I will go\ncheck with the microsoft.com DNS server.\n\n322\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.630\nAnd he sends a third query,\nhe says hey Microsoft DNS server,\n\n323\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:25.459\ndo you know the IP address\nof www.microsoft.com?\n\n324\n00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:30.780\nThe microsoft.com DNS says,\nas a matter of fact I do, I know about all\n\n325\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.230\nthe machines that end in microsoft.com,\nI know their names and IP addresses.\n\n326\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.510\nHere is the IP address for\nwww.microsoft.com.\n\n327\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.552\nSo finally after all of these queries,\n\n328\n00:17:42.552 --> 00:17:47.380\nmy DNS server now has the IP\naddress of www.microsoft.com.\n\n329\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.830\nHe gives it back to the client,\nmy client then can\n\n330\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.930\nuse that IP address to talk to\nthe www.microsoft.com server, web server.\n\n331\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.649\nAnd return the webpage and magically\nmicrosoft.com appears on my browser.\n\n332\n00:18:00.649 --> 00:18:03.667\n&gt;&gt; Now that's interesting Mike because\nI would have thought looking at a web\n\n333\n00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.210\nbrowser, I'm gonna read, right.\n\n334\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.490\nLeft to right, but what you're telling me\nhere is when it goes through the process\n\n335\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.730\nof trying to resolve that name through\nthe questions you're telling me.\n\n336\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.892\nIt starts from the right and\nit works its way back to the first\n\n337\n00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:19.066\nportion of whatever the address or\nthe name is in this case.\n\n338\n00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:21.865\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's exactly right,\nit starts at the .com.\n\n339\n00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:25.717\nAnd when we talk about a fully\nqualified domain name, all right.\n\n340\n00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:30.108\nA fully qualified domain name includes\nthe hostname and the DNS suffix, so\n\n341\n00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:32.720\nmy hostname is mikeslaptop.\n\n342\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.470\nIt's the name of my machine, right?\n\n343\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.088\nIt's actually dagobah, but I'm embarrassed\nto tell people that sometimes.\n\n344\n00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:44.052\nSo I'll tell you guys since I already did,\nmy machine's name is dagobah and\n\n345\n00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:48.090\nthat's its hostname, but\nit belongs to ITPro.TV domain.\n\n346\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:53.827\nSo my DNS suffix is ITPro.TV, so\nmy fully qualified domain name\n\n347\n00:18:53.827 --> 00:18:59.579\nis putting those two together,\ndagobah.ITPro.TV, right?\n\n348\n00:18:59.579 --> 00:19:02.953\nThat's an FQDN,\nnow technically what we don't see a lot of\n\n349\n00:19:02.953 --> 00:19:07.850\nthe times is at the end of the name,\nthere's actually a trailing period.\n\n350\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:14.216\nIt's technically if you wanna be\ncorrect it's dagobah.ITPro.TV.,\n\n351\n00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:19.567\nthere's actually a dot after that,\nwww.microsoft.com.\n\n352\n00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:24.376\nWell that dot at the very end is the root,\nthat's what says this is the top and\n\n353\n00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:29.810\nit will never be anything further to the\nright of that, is this is the very top.\n\n354\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:35.180\nAnd then to the left of that you've got\nyour top level domains, com, biz, gov.\n\n355\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.110\nTo the left of that you've got your second\nlevel domains, the ones that we have to\n\n356\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.530\nregister, and that's another thing\nthat I wanna make sure we understand.\n\n357\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.134\nThose second level domains,\nMicrosoft, ITPro, Contoso,\n\n358\n00:19:47.134 --> 00:19:50.500\nNewegg, Google, those are registered.\n\n359\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.610\nThat way when you register a name like\nthat you're saying, I'm gonna use this\n\n360\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.470\nportion of the namespace, ITPro.tv,\nnobody else can use it, right.\n\n361\n00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.360\nThat's how we make sure that I\ncan't run a microsoft.com and\n\n362\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.510\ntry to pretend to be microsoft.com,\nMicrosoft's registered that domain,\n\n363\n00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.630\nthat's theirs to use and\nI can't use it, all right.\n\n364\n00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.106\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike you mentioned IP\naddresses had to be unique.\n\n365\n00:20:12.106 --> 00:20:16.101\nSo now what you're saying is that if I've\ngot a domain name we're gonna have some\n\n366\n00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:17.828\nconflict if they're not unique.\n\n367\n00:20:17.828 --> 00:20:22.704\nSo one of the reasons ICANN,\nthe big dogs there, maybe allocate these\n\n368\n00:20:22.704 --> 00:20:27.430\nto registrars and then like you said,\nI have to register that name.\n\n369\n00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.950\nSo now it goes in a listing and there\naren't any conflicts out there, right?\n\n370\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.000\nWe can't have Microsoft going to two\ncompletely different companies or\n\n371\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.155\nGoogle or\nwe're gonna have some kind of conflict.\n\n372\n00:20:36.155 --> 00:20:38.460\nSo that namespace has to be unique.\n\n373\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does and it helps us,\nit's a lot like first names and\n\n374\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.080\nlast names or family names, right.\n\n375\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.188\nMy name is Mike, but that's not unique,\nthere's a lot of Mikes out there.\n\n376\n00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:51.262\nAnd when I'm with my family or\nwhatever they can say Mike and\n\n377\n00:20:51.262 --> 00:20:54.560\nI'm gonna respond and\nit's the only Mike that responds.\n\n378\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.294\nBut if we're in a crowd of people if\nI say, Mike it's not specific enough,\n\n379\n00:20:58.294 --> 00:21:01.574\nthere can be several Mikes and\nmight get replies from all of them.\n\n380\n00:21:01.574 --> 00:21:05.637\nWhen you add my last name to it, Mike\nRodrick, well now that's unique to me and\n\n381\n00:21:05.637 --> 00:21:08.671\nthey'll make sure they're\ntalking to the correct Mike.\n\n382\n00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:12.931\nAnd it's the same thing with DNS, the host\nname is a lot like our first name or\n\n383\n00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:14.670\nour given name, right?\n\n384\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.774\nMy machine is Dagobah, but you might have\na laptop named Dagobah as well, all right.\n\n385\n00:21:19.774 --> 00:21:25.344\nBut my machine belongs to ITPro.tv, that's\nkinda like my surname or my last name,\n\n386\n00:21:25.344 --> 00:21:31.084\nso Dagobah in and of itself is not unique,\nbut Dagobah.ITPro.TV is unique, right?\n\n387\n00:21:31.084 --> 00:21:34.627\nSo when we combine those up we\nget that FQDN that is unique, and\n\n388\n00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:38.130\nwhen we resolve a name I\nneed to know that last part.\n\n389\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.060\nLet's say you've got a mail server\nthat's named mail01, all right, so\n\n390\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.850\nI go home and\nhere at ITProTV we've got mail01.ITPro.TV.\n\n391\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.090\nSo I'm going to configure my mail\napplication, I can't just put mail01,\n\n392\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.020\nthere could be several organizations\nthat have machines named mail01.\n\n393\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.280\nI need to use the fully qualified domain\nname for that, mail01.ITPro.TV so\n\n394\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.810\nthat it knows which mail01 to\ncommunicate with, or to talk to.\n\n395\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.700\nAll right, so I think we've got\nthe basics down there as far as.\n\n396\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:17.230\nThe root is the very top, then below\nthat we've got the top level domains,\n\n397\n00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.730\nand then below that we've got our\nsecond level or our registered domains.\n\n398\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.703\nSomething else we should point out is that\nonce you've registered your portion of\n\n399\n00:22:25.703 --> 00:22:29.370\nthe namespace, we have ITpro.TV, okay.\n\n400\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.720\nCan't go any further to the right\nbecause .TV., that's the root,\n\n401\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.830\nthe very top, but\nto the left is completely open.\n\n402\n00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:43.730\nOnce I've registered that second level\ndomain, ITPro.TV, that's unique to me.\n\n403\n00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.811\nWhat if I wanna make a child domain?\n\n404\n00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:50.966\nI could do labs.ITPro.TV and\nsales.ITPro.TV,\n\n405\n00:22:50.966 --> 00:22:57.646\nI could do east.labs.ITPro.TV,\nand west.labs.ITPro.TV,\n\n406\n00:22:57.646 --> 00:23:01.874\nI could do dev.east.labs.ITPro.tv.\n\n407\n00:23:01.874 --> 00:23:06.330\nI can keep going to the left\nas far as I want, all right.\n\n408\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.670\nOnce you've registered that name,\nagain think of it like a pyramid,\n\n409\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.420\nat the top there's the root and\nbelow that is .TV.\n\n410\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.660\nBelow that is ITPro.TV, and as we go\ndown below that, that's all me, from\n\n411\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:25.150\nthat point down is my responsibility, that\nITPro.TV and anything that left of it.\n\n412\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.730\nI have to run DNS servers to maintain\nthose, what we call resource records.\n\n413\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.981\nA resource record is the actual\nentry in the DNS server that\n\n414\n00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:38.685\nsays dagobah.ITPro.TV is 10.1.5.12,\nall right.\n\n415\n00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:40.967\nThat's what's called a resource record,\n\n416\n00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:45.410\nspecifically that type of record would be\nknown as an a record or a host record.\n\n417\n00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:51.621\nOr a quad a record in IPv6, because it's\nfour times larger than in IPv4, right?\n\n418\n00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:55.792\nSo a versus quad a,\n32-bits versus 128-bits,\n\n419\n00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:59.068\nall right so that's our infrastructure.\n\n420\n00:23:59.068 --> 00:24:02.482\nThe only other thing probably\nthat they might get you\n\n421\n00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:07.061\non the exam is the whole concept of\nRecursive and iterative queries and\n\n422\n00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:12.200\nI believe I still have a drawing around\nhere that was it right there wasn't it?\n\n423\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.860\nAll right, let's use this one.\n\n424\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.650\nRecursive and iterative queries.\n\n425\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.750\nI said when you send a question to\na DNS server it's known as a query.\n\n426\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.010\nThere's two different types\nof queries we'll use.\n\n427\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:29.080\nThere are recursive queries and\nthere are iterative queries.\n\n428\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:35.000\nWhen you send a recursive query,\na recursive query requires an answer.\n\n429\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.030\nIt's like she sells,\nsea shells by the sea shore.\n\n430\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.950\nRecursive query requires an answer,\nall right.\n\n431\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.040\nThat's just the way I remember\nrecursive requires there's\n\n432\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.380\na little way that I kinda\nkeep those straight.\n\n433\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.100\nWhat I mean by that is when I send\na recursive query I'm saying hey DNS.\n\n434\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.980\nWhat is IP address of\nsay www.google.com and\n\n435\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.740\ndon't come back with out an answer,\nall right.\n\n436\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.620\nWhere recursive query says here's\nwhat I'm looking for and you go and\n\n437\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.820\ndo all of the work.\n\n438\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.950\nAll right, and let me know.\n\n439\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.640\nIn fact, I'm gonna jump over\nto a different slide here.\n\n440\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.490\nThis one is gonna show\nme a little bit better.\n\n441\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.830\nWe don't need the forwarding just yet,\nthat's another concept.\n\n442\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.710\nSo, here's my laptop.\n\n443\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.820\nAnd I'm gonna type in, well,\n\n444\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.970\nwe'll change to www since that's what\nI've got on the slide, www.microsoft.com.\n\n445\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.590\nSo, I send a query,\nthat'll be this arrow right here.\n\n446\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.220\nTo my DNS server, and\nit's a recursive query.\n\n447\n00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.940\nIt says I need the IP\naddress of www.microsoft.com.\n\n448\n00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.240\nBecause another type of\nquery is an iterative query.\n\n449\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.960\nAnd iterative query can either\naccept the answer as a result or\n\n450\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.157\na referral to another DNS server.\n\n451\n00:25:43.157 --> 00:25:46.339\nBut for the client when you're\ntyping in www.microsoft.com\n\n452\n00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:49.860\nin your browser a referrals\nnot going to do you any good.\n\n453\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.700\nYou need the IP address so that\nthe browser can open up that web page.\n\n454\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.260\nSo you send a recursive query,\nyou say, hey,\n\n455\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.510\nthis is the IP address I need go find\nit and let me know when you're done.\n\n456\n00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.520\nSo your DNS server takes over the job and\nsays, all right, and he goes and\n\n457\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.700\nhe talks to the root,\nlike we talked about earlier.\n\n458\n00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.300\nAnd he says, what's the IP\naddress of www.microsoft.com?\n\n459\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.710\nNotice this is a green arrow.\n\n460\n00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.480\nIt's an iterative query.\n\n461\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.580\nHey root, either tell me the IP\naddress I'm looking for or\n\n462\n00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.510\ntell me somewhere else I can look.\n\n463\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.180\nYou're not expecting the root\nto do all the work for you.\n\n464\n00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.842\nYou're not saying, hey, what's\nthe IP address of www.microsoft.com?\n\n465\n00:26:26.842 --> 00:26:28.710\nGo figure it out and\nlet me know when you're done.\n\n466\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.840\nThe root is gonna tell you whatever.\n\n467\n00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.280\nIt doesn't have time for that.\n\n468\n00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.420\nSo you send an iterative query that says,\ngive me the answer or\n\n469\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.680\nat least refer me to somebody else.\n\n470\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.570\nSo that's when he replies with\nthe IP address of the .com\n\n471\n00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.870\ntop level domain server, DNS server.\n\n472\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.050\nThen my DNS server sends another\niterative query to the .com server,\n\n473\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.440\nsays what's the IP address\nof www.Microsoft.com,\n\n474\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.790\nit replies I don't know but\nhere's a referral.\n\n475\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.360\nRemember iterative can accept\nthe answer for a referral and\n\n476\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.150\nit refers him to\nthe microsoft.com DNS server.\n\n477\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.040\nAnd so, my DNS server says\nyes let me go talk to him.\n\n478\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.160\nHe knows the answer.\n\n479\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.670\nHe's able to look up www.microsoft.com\nbecause he is the microsoft.com\n\n480\n00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.510\nDNS server, he knows the answer.\n\n481\n00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.860\nSo, he replies with the answer.\n\n482\n00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.740\nRemember iterative can either\naccept a reform or the answer.\n\n483\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.102\nNow my DNS Server has the answer which\nfinally gets passed back to the client,\n\n484\n00:27:27.102 --> 00:27:28.630\nall right?\n\n485\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.710\nAnd now I know the IP address and\nmy browser opens up.\n\n486\n00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.110\nAll this is happening,\njust think about that for a second.\n\n487\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.740\nEvery time you type in an address in\nyour little lap top or your computer.\n\n488\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.740\nYou're sending a query to DNS and\n\n489\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.180\nall of this other stuff is\nhappening in the background, right?\n\n490\n00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.050\nAnd then finally, your DNS server gets\nthe answer and gives it back to you.\n\n491\n00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.350\nNow, think about how long it takes\nwhen you open up a browser and\n\n492\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.920\ntype in a name,\nhow long it takes to get to that webpage.\n\n493\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.380\nAnd I know, sometimes our ISPs are slow\nand our machines are slow, but\n\n494\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.490\nin general, it's less than seconds, right?\n\n495\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.500\nIt's pretty darn quick and\nit's a pretty impressive system.\n\n496\n00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, with this process here,\nif I've asked that question, and\n\n497\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.680\nI've asked the DNS server here in your\nnetwork that you show us for ITPro.TV, and\n\n498\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.470\nI say, what is the IP address\nof Microsoft, www.microsoft.com?\n\n499\n00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.320\nIf I need to go there again,\ndo I need to ask that question again,\n\n500\n00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.790\ndo I have to ask the DNS\nserver the question again?\n\n501\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.130\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nand the answer would be no.\n\n502\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.200\nOne of the things it allows us\nto speed up name resolution\n\n503\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.140\nis something called caching.\n\n504\n00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:33.670\nEvery DNS server caches\nanswers that it gets.\n\n505\n00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.210\nAnd cache, C-A-C-H-E,\nnot C-A-S-H, C-A-C-H-E,\n\n506\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:42.010\nis temporary, just like the cash in your\nwallet, [LAUGH] is what I like to say It's\n\n507\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.990\ntemporary storage, but it does allow it to\nremember the answer for a little while.\n\n508\n00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.110\nAnd so what happens,\nlet's say what Wes said.\n\n509\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.710\nI went to www.Microsoft.com.\n\n510\n00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.360\nMy DNS server went through all of\nthis work, got the answer for me,\n\n511\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.010\nand gave it back to me.\n\n512\n00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.080\nAnd then,\nWes decides to go to www.Microsoft.com.\n\n513\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.960\nWell when he sends a query\nto the ITProTv's DNS server,\n\n514\n00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.280\nITProTV says wait a second.\n\n515\n00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.860\nI just got that answer from Mike\nnot more than two seconds ago,\n\n516\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.180\nlet me pull it out of my cache,\nand here you go.\n\n517\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.130\nAnd it never even left the local network,\nit already knew the answer because\n\n518\n00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.060\nsomebody else had asked the same question,\njust a few seconds ago.\n\n519\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.770\nNow how long if cashes that for\n\n520\n00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.830\nis determined by the DNS server in this\ncase it would be Microsoft DNS server,\n\n521\n00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.205\nalong with answer that he gave me when he\nsaid hey where is the IP address of www.\n\n522\n00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:38.550\nMicrosoft.com, by the way you can\nhold on to that answer for 5 minutes.\n\n523\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.140\nYou can cache it for five minutes, after\nthat, I'm gonna need you to throw it away.\n\n524\n00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.360\nAnd so, if Wes waited for six minutes and\n\n525\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.970\nthen decided to go to www.microsoft.com my\nDNS server would have to go through this\n\n526\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.930\nprocess again, because Microsoft said\nI can only hold it for five minutes.\n\n527\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.710\nI threw the answer away.\n\n528\n00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.320\nAnd now,\nwe are going to the process again, right.\n\n529\n00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.670\nNow you might be thinking, that is silly.\n\n530\n00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.110\nWhy would you throw it away?\n\n531\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.880\nWhy won't you just save\nthe answer forever?\n\n532\n00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.310\nBecause everything change, right.\n\n533\n00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.340\nI can't hold on an answer forever,\n\n534\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.490\nbecause if Microsoft's IP address\nchanges I need to know that.\n\n535\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.730\nAnd so, if I keep that for days or\nweeks or months, there's a good chance.\n\n536\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.610\nOr load balancing, they don't want me\nhitting the same server every single time.\n\n537\n00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.330\nEvery time I talk to DNS,\nthey might give me a different answer.\n\n538\n00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.720\nThey've got Hundreds of Web servers.\n\n539\n00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.470\nAnd so, when I say heres the IP\naddress of www.microsoft.com\n\n540\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.310\nthere actually rotating\nthrough several IP addresses.\n\n541\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.000\nThey not always giving you\nthe same answer to try spread\n\n542\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.900\nlittle across multiple servers.\n\n543\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.830\nWell, if you cast the answer forever.\n\n544\n00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.120\nYou would never use any of\ntheir other web servers.\n\n545\n00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.520\nYou'd always be connecting\nto the same one and\n\n546\n00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.360\nthat would defeat the purpose\nof load balancing.\n\n547\n00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.740\nSo, Wes in correct in the fact that\nthere is a process known as caching\n\n548\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.210\nthat can speed this up.\n\n549\n00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.780\nYour machine even caches it,\nthat's another cool thing.\n\n550\n00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.280\nNot only does your DNS server cache it,\nso if a third employee\n\n551\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.390\nonce we go to the same website we dont\nhave to look at it we can talk to DNS.\n\n552\n00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.170\nDNS already knows the answer cuz Wes\njust went there 30 seconds ago he knows\n\n553\n00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.143\nthe answer.\n\n554\n00:31:11.143 --> 00:31:16.460\nBut my machine cached a two when I\ngot the answer from my DNS server.\n\n555\n00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.040\nMy DNS server cached for\nlets say five minutes.\n\n556\n00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.980\nBut I cache it for five minutes as well.\n\n557\n00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.930\nSo, if I close my browser and\nthen go, shoot.\n\n558\n00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.680\nI forgot to write down that link.\n\n559\n00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.260\nAnd I open my browser back up, and\nI go right back to www.microsoft.com.\n\n560\n00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.355\nI don't even have to talk to DNS DNS.\n\n561\n00:31:31.355 --> 00:31:33.935\nI could look in my own local cache and\n\n562\n00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:38.665\nI can go straight back to Microsoft.com,\nwhich again, speeds up the process, right.\n\n563\n00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:40.545\nIt makes it much, much faster.\n\n564\n00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:44.375\nAnd that's occurring all throughout DNS,\nthat whole caching process.\n\n565\n00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:47.865\n&gt;&gt; I tell you man, it's glad to know\nwe have a service helping us out and\n\n566\n00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:50.335\nbacking us up like the domain name system.\n\n567\n00:31:50.335 --> 00:31:52.290\nNow, Mike, looking at the clock.\n\n568\n00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.250\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n569\n00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.070\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional advice you might like to throw\n\n570\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.495\nabout there when it comes to DNS?\n\n571\n00:31:59.495 --> 00:32:01.630\n&gt;&gt; No, like I said, for\nthis particular exam,\n\n572\n00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.780\nthey want you to have a high-level\nunderstanding of the architecture itself.\n\n573\n00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.730\nSo that means pay attention to what\nwe were talking about, the root,\n\n574\n00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.610\nthe top level domains, and\n\n575\n00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.270\nthen my DNS servers that we run\nare those second level domains.\n\n576\n00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.910\nUnderstand a little bit\nabout the query process so\n\n577\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:22.420\nwe know that if I've got my local DNS\nserver and I can resolve local names.\n\n578\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.920\nBut if I can't connect to\nthe root from my DNS server,\n\n579\n00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.790\nI won't be able to resolve external name.\n\n580\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.760\nSo, if we're troubleshooting DNS for\nexample, and I can resolve local names but\n\n581\n00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.380\nnot external names, I need to take\na look at my DNS server and see.\n\n582\n00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.080\nWhy it can't start that process,\ngo to the root and work its way down.\n\n583\n00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.335\nOn a Windows DNS server,\nthere's actually a little file,\n\n584\n00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:46.270\nDNS.cache that stores the IP\naddress of all those root servers.\n\n585\n00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.630\nIf that got erased, deleted,\n\n586\n00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.960\nchanged, whatever, your DNS server might\nnot be able to connect to the root.\n\n587\n00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.805\nIf I can't start at the top and\nwork my way down, I'll never find that\n\n588\n00:32:54.805 --> 00:32:58.758\nmicrosoft.com DNS server, and I won't be\nable to resolve those external names.\n\n589\n00:32:58.758 --> 00:33:01.930\nSo, other than that,\n\n590\n00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.694\nno, I just thought that DNS is one\nof the cooler services out there.\n\n591\n00:33:04.694 --> 00:33:05.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is.\n\n592\n00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.470\nWell, Mike, that's a great place\nto wrap this one up, thank you for\n\n593\n00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.570\nbeing here in the studios, thank you for\nyou, the viewer, watching.\n\n594\n00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.350\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.311\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:08.302\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n3\n00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:11.874\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:14.637\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:16.320\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.730\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.324\nwe're continuing through our\nGIAC security essentials, GSEC.\n\n8\n00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:25.165\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:25.930\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.040\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.850\nAnd yay, more fun stuff with GIAC.\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.980\nAnd this one, we're gonna be\nlooking at protocols and packets.\n\n14\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd we're gonna start by going\nback to the very beginning.\n\n15\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.670\nFor a lot of you,\nsome of you probably don't remember.\n\n16\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.590\nWell, I shouldn't say that, but it might\nhave been a while since you've looked\n\n17\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.870\nat what we're getting ready to talk about,\nand that is the good old OSI model.\n\n18\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.230\nI know I say that, and\na lot of people start shivering.\n\n19\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.980\nNo, not that again.\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.450\nBut let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n21\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.120\nAgain, we're not gonna go\ninto depth on the OSI model.\n\n22\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.820\nAt this point, we should have\na good understanding of what it is,\n\n23\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.380\nwhat it represents.\n\n24\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.344\nI just wanted a real quick refresher,\nwhen we talk about the OSI model,\n\n25\n00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:13.006\nand we broke up into different layers,\nyou've got seven of them.\n\n26\n00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:17.000\nRight, if we start up there at the top,\nyou've got that application layer and\n\n27\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.297\nthen presentation, session, transport,\nnetwork, I have to shape for that one,\n\n28\n00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:22.950\nmake sure I've got that right.\n\n29\n00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.550\nNetwork, data link, and then physical,\nthose are our different layers.\n\n30\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.280\nAnd when an application\nwants to send data,\n\n31\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.070\nright, it's got to take that data and\npass it down from the application layer,\n\n32\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.740\nwhich is where our user interface is,\nit's where we deal with our applications.\n\n33\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.310\nIf it needs to send data across\nthe network, it's gotta be prepared, and\n\n34\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.650\nit has to go through\nthese different layers.\n\n35\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.810\nIt gets all packaged up,\nbundled up, modified, transformed,\n\n36\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.310\nwhatever needs to be done to it,\nencrypted maybe, that kind of thing.\n\n37\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.278\nGets all the way down to\nthat physical layer, and\n\n38\n00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:54.625\nthen it goes across the network.\n\n39\n00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:59.058\nAnd then it comes back up the other side\nand eventually gets put back together in\n\n40\n00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.945\na way that the application\ncan then interpret it and\n\n41\n00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.110\ndisplay it on your recipient's end.\n\n42\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.300\nNow, it's a little more\ncomplicated than that, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.788\nIf we've really looked at it,\n\n44\n00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:12.942\nthere's a lot of cross communication\nat the actual layer, where\n\n45\n00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:17.110\nthe session layer on one side is talking\nto the session layer on the other side.\n\n46\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.683\nThe transport layer, same thing.\n\n47\n00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:22.335\nSo there's a lot more to it, it's not that\nit neatly falls down through the stack and\n\n48\n00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:23.642\nthen back up the other stack.\n\n49\n00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.390\nBut it's an easy way to look at it and\ncomprehend it.\n\n50\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.460\n&gt;&gt; Man, I tell you,\nwhen I first learned this,\n\n51\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.840\nthat was a misconception\nI had of the OSI model.\n\n52\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.748\nI thought it was straight\ndown the seven layers and\n\n53\n00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:34.120\nstraight back up the seven layers.\n\n54\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.891\nBut like you mentioned,\nsession layer's a great example.\n\n55\n00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.270\nIf you need a session-oriented,\nsomething like TCP,\n\n56\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.421\nwhich I know we're gonna get into,\nand I'm kinda jumping ahead on Mike.\n\n57\n00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.469\nBut it stops right there and it says\nhold on a second, let me go out and\n\n58\n00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.033\nI'll start that session for you.\n\n59\n00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.410\nAnd then once that's built up,\nthen we go through that layer.\n\n60\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.780\nSo we do kind of a hopscotch, right?\n\n61\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n62\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.230\nBut when you're learning this and\n\n63\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.740\nwhen you wanna talk about it conceptually,\nthis is an easy way to represent it.\n\n64\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.370\nAnd then to throw us all for a loop,\nright, the OSI model is a, Stan or Wes,\n\n65\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.170\ndo you know what OSI stands for?\n\n66\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.350\n&gt;&gt; I do, it is the open\nsystems interconnection model.\n\n67\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.810\nAnd one thing's funny is the group\nthat's overseeing this and\n\n68\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.960\nactually started in 1984 is called\nthe ISO, so that's how I remembered it.\n\n69\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.266\nMirror image backwards,\nthe ISO created the OSI.\n\n70\n00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.320\nBoy, I'll tell you what,\nwe are not shy on alphabet soup today.\n\n71\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.545\n&gt;&gt; We are not.\n\n72\n00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:29.763\nAnd the interesting thing is, this is\na model, and it's like any other standard.\n\n73\n00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:32.232\nIf everybody follows the standard,\n\n74\n00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:36.460\nthings work together really nicely,\nthey play along nicely.\n\n75\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.549\nBut you don't have to implement\nit exactly like this, in fact,\n\n76\n00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.730\nwhat we see is the TCP/IP doesn't\nfollow this exactly, right?\n\n77\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.130\nWhen we look at the TCP/IP model,\nthere's actually four layers, right?\n\n78\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.160\nBut all of these layers are actually\npresent, which is interesting.\n\n79\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.460\nSo let me flip over to\nanother screen here, and\n\n80\n00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.250\nwe'll take a quick peek at this diagram.\n\n81\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.760\nAnd this is just showing us,\non the left, I've got the OSI model.\n\n82\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.430\nOn the right, I've got the TCP/IP model.\n\n83\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.680\nAnd you can see that\nthe application layer on the TCP/IP\n\n84\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010\nactually performs all the functionality\nof the application layer,\n\n85\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.810\nthe presentation layer, and\nthe session layer in the OSI model.\n\n86\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.110\nThe transport is a one to one mapping,\nthe network is still a one to one mapping,\n\n87\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.160\nbut they call it Internet,\ninstead of network in the TCP/IP model.\n\n88\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.920\nAnd then the host to network is\nthe data link in physical, mm, right?\n\n89\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.610\nBut again, everything is going\nto perform the same way.\n\n90\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.470\nThere is a session that's brought up\nwhen you're doing TCP/IP, all right, so\n\n91\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.230\nthat that part is in there.\n\n92\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.050\nIt's just they combine\nsome of these together,\n\n93\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.720\nand it's not super important again.\n\n94\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.135\nThis is a network plus, so\nthey're not, hopefully,\n\n95\n00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:51.310\ngonna be testing us on the intricacies\nof the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.\n\n96\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.600\nBut it is something that we need to\nunderstand, we need to be familiar with.\n\n97\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.670\nEspecially when we start\nlooking at packets,\n\n98\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.030\nright, when we start taking apart packets.\n\n99\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.386\nBecause as a security professional and\nfor passing the GSEC from GIAC,\n\n100\n00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:08.669\nwe're gonna need to be able to\nlook at raw packet dumps and\n\n101\n00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.506\nbe able to interpret some of that\ninformation that's in there.\n\n102\n00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:17.140\nAnd this is something that probably\na lot of you might not have done before.\n\n103\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.020\nNot gone that deep into looking\nat raw packet data, right?\n\n104\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.200\nWe rely a lot on our GUIs and\nthings like that.\n\n105\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.280\nBut there are times if you're\ndoing incident response, if you're\n\n106\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.860\ntrying to investigate a potential attack,\nyou need to get in and look at those.\n\n107\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.367\nYou need to understand what's going on,\nsee what they're trying to do,\n\n108\n00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:39.269\npossibly prevent something.\n\n109\n00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:42.935\nOr be able to patch against it,\nso very important that we, again,\n\n110\n00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:45.865\nhave a basic concept of\nwhat's going on here.\n\n111\n00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:49.125\nAnd then we're gonna take\na look again at breaking down\n\n112\n00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:53.630\nsome of the header information in some of\nthe different fields in an actual packet.\n\n113\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.520\nNow the next thing I wanna talk\nabout is just IP in general.\n\n114\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.110\nInternet protocol is a protocol, and\nlet's define protocol real quick.\n\n115\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.530\nJust a set of rules that governs our\ncommunications or how we communicate.\n\n116\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.290\nWe know there's several\ndifferent protocols.\n\n117\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.350\nAnd it's kind of like a language, right,\nit's a set of rules that allow two nodes,\n\n118\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.800\nfor example,\nto communicate with each other.\n\n119\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.020\nThink about it as a human language,\nright, Wes and I both speak English,\n\n120\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.820\nwe can communicate relatively well when my\nmouth is working the way it's supposed to.\n\n121\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.750\nAs we've all seen,\nsometimes I get a little tongue tied.\n\n122\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.280\nBut if I spoke English and\n\n123\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.840\nWes only spoke German, we'd have\na harder time communicating, right?\n\n124\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.720\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n125\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.110\nProtocols are a set of rules that\nboth ends have to understand\n\n126\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.640\nto be able to follow those rules and\ncommunicate successfully.\n\n127\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.930\nIf one end is speaking one protocol,\nthe other end is speaking a different\n\n128\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.150\nprotocol, they're not gonna be\nable to communicate, right?\n\n129\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.520\nSo a protocol's the set of rules\nthat governs how we communicate.\n\n130\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.460\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the things that\ngoes right back to the TCPI model and\n\n131\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.160\nthe OSI model right there that you're\nshowing us, is that consistency.\n\n132\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.880\nSo you get the inner operability\nin your communications.\n\n133\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.986\nIf you step outside the bounds of that,\nwell yeah, you can, but\n\n134\n00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:05.756\ndoesn't necessarily mean you're gonna\ncommunicate with everything [CROSSTALK].\n\n135\n00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:10.128\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, now IP is a protocol\nthat works down in the network or\n\n136\n00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:15.860\nthe Internet layer, we'll go ahead and\nstick with the TCP/IP model, I guess.\n\n137\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.150\nIt's more appropriate for us.\n\n138\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.450\nBut it's gonna be down in there in\nlayer 3 at that Internet layer.\n\n139\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.095\nAnd really, IP is responsible,\nInternet protocol is responsible for\n\n140\n00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:33.069\nrouting, for delivering packets from one\nnetwork to another, as well as addressing.\n\n141\n00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.592\nThis is where our network addresses\nare put on these packets,\n\n142\n00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:40.398\nwhich is what allows them to be\nrouted from one network to another.\n\n143\n00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:45.357\nSo that's the primary purpose of\nthat IP protocol, addressing and\n\n144\n00:07:45.357 --> 00:07:48.608\nrouting those packets, right?\n\n145\n00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:52.500\nNow, we're gonna take a look at\nraw packets in a little while.\n\n146\n00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.983\nBut first, before we go there, let's talk\nabout them and kind of break them out.\n\n147\n00:07:56.983 --> 00:07:58.463\nSo then when we get ready to look at them,\n\n148\n00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:00.389\nwe'll understand what\nthe heck We're looking at.\n\n149\n00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.667\nSo in the objective for\n\n150\n00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:05.835\nthis exam they do call out what we're\ngetting ready to talk about so do make\n\n151\n00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:10.204\nsure you spend some time here this is one\nof the areas that a lot of us will need to\n\n152\n00:08:10.204 --> 00:08:14.272\nfocus on because it's not something\nwe're used to doing all the time.\n\n153\n00:08:14.272 --> 00:08:19.495\nIt might be newer to us, we've maybe\nnever used a packet capture utility and\n\n154\n00:08:19.495 --> 00:08:24.652\ndealt with raw packets so make sure you\ndo prepare adequately for the exam.\n\n155\n00:08:24.652 --> 00:08:29.115\nSo when we talk about packets again\nthis is just a little drawing I\n\n156\n00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:33.390\nwhipped up just to kinda show\nus the concept or the idea.\n\n157\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.420\nIt was sorta visible in my other drawing\n\n158\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.930\nwhere you notice in here the data\nis this yellow, you know what?\n\n159\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.320\nAnd I failed to start zoom it again.\n\n160\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.810\nSo let's go ahead and\nfire up zoom it real quick, so\n\n161\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.460\nthat I can zoom in to some of\nthese areas for everybody.\n\n162\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.520\nThere we go.\n\n163\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.630\nSo you can see that yellow is the data.\n\n164\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.230\nThat's the pay load, what we want to\ndeliver from one end to the other.\n\n165\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.970\nAnd then at each one of these layers, it's\nlike that data is getting encapsulated.\n\n166\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.630\nNow this isn't completely accurate.\n\n167\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:13.260\nNot every layer adds a header,\nAdds a foot, or they might do one or both.\n\n168\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.860\nBut conceptually it's nice to see it this\nway, cuz you can really think about it as\n\n169\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.860\nthat data goes down through those layers,\nit gets wrapped up, right?\n\n170\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.335\nAt the presentation layer,\nit puts all the presentation information.\n\n171\n00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:28.793\nAnd then it goes down into the session\nlayer, there's another layer around that.\n\n172\n00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:32.015\nSo you can just think of this keep\nwrapping that data up and more and\n\n173\n00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:35.655\nmore information gets down at the bottom,\ngets center-cross the network at the other\n\n174\n00:09:35.655 --> 00:09:39.300\nside we're basically stripping each\none of those layers off, right?\n\n175\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.910\nThe network layer is pulling\nthis information off and\n\n176\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.350\nthen sending that packet\nup to the transport layer.\n\n177\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.070\nPulls its information out, uses it,\n\n178\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.570\ndoes what it needs to do with it and\nthen sends it up to the next layer.\n\n179\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.520\nSlowly removing everything until we\nget back up to the application layer\n\n180\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.630\nwhere we've got the data ready for\nthe application.\n\n181\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.320\nAnd that's what I was trying to show\nhere as well when we're dealing with\n\n182\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.830\nthe TCP/IP model and our four layers.\n\n183\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.890\nYou've got the application layer,\nright, which is gonna have that data.\n\n184\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.740\nAs it gets down to the transport\nlayer we're gonna add a TCP or\n\n185\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.020\nUDP header, and we'll talk about\nwhat's in there here in just a minute.\n\n186\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.200\nThat adds that to that Bit of data.\n\n187\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.530\nAnd at this point at the transport layer,\n\n188\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.490\nwe're really dealing with what we\nwould call segments, all right?\n\n189\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.920\nAs it's dividing cuz there are rules to\nhow much can fit into a single packet.\n\n190\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.460\nSome of these terms though you hear people\nusing them a little interchangeably\n\n191\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:47.880\nsegments packets, datagrams, frames,\nhonestly it really isn't I think,\n\n192\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.720\nlet me just double check on that other\ndrawing, I think I put it out here, yeah.\n\n193\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.530\nYou can see it's really called data\nas we go down through the first three\n\n194\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.670\nlayers there.\n\n195\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.910\nAt that transport layer,\nwe end up with what's called segments.\n\n196\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.120\nAnd then when it gets\ndown to the third layer,\n\n197\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.840\nthe network layer it's either a packet or\na datagram.\n\n198\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.010\nAnd then the data link\nlayer calls it a frame.\n\n199\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.020\nAnd then once we get down to the physical\nlayer, it's just ones and zeros,\n\n200\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.850\nit's bits that are streaming\nacross to make that.\n\n201\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.190\nSo just some terminology there.\n\n202\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.730\nAnd obviously, most people again,\n\n203\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.580\nwill call it a packet no matter what layer\nits at and most people are okay with that.\n\n204\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.890\nIf you wanna get specific\nwhere they ask you on the exam\n\n205\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.500\nto segment at that transport layer its a\npacket or data gram at that network layer.\n\n206\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.130\nLets not zoom in,\nlets go back to the spreadsheet, and so\n\n207\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.730\nthen we got our segment here wit hour\nTCP UDP header information put on there.\n\n208\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.608\nAnd then you've got your Internet layer,\n\n209\n00:11:43.608 --> 00:11:47.092\nremember with TCP/IP model,\nthere's only four layers.\n\n210\n00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:50.250\nWe got Internet, which is basically\nnetwork from the OSI model.\n\n211\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.230\nAnd we're gonna get our IP header put on\nthere, and this is where like source and\n\n212\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.810\ndestination address are gonna be located.\n\n213\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.670\nAnd the green parts, sorry, can't move\nmy mouse while I've got this zoomed in.\n\n214\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.007\nYou'll notice that the data\nat the application there,\n\n215\n00:12:04.007 --> 00:12:10.520\nwhen it gets down to the transport layer\nthat green box is the data, right?\n\n216\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.080\nAnd then it adds the TCP or\nUDP header to it.\n\n217\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.740\nAnd then, when that drops down into\nthe Internet layer, where it says IP data,\n\n218\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.200\nthat's the original data,\nand the TCP/UDP header.\n\n219\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.750\nRight, now becomes the IP data so\nthis whole, and let me zoom out.\n\n220\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.860\nThis whole thing right here\nbecomes the IP data and\n\n221\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.850\nthe IP header gets put\non the front of that.\n\n222\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.870\nAnd then this whole thing becomes the\nframe data and the frame header gets put\n\n223\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.810\non and a frame footer gets put on\ndown there at that link layer,\n\n224\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.230\nat the very bottom there, all right?\n\n225\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.050\nSo a little bit about how these packets\nare working and how are forming.\n\n226\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.010\nAnd again you hear me say packets, how\nwe're forming our segments, our packets,\n\n227\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.890\nour datagrams, our frame that\nare getting ready to go across.\n\n228\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.530\nNow let's take a look\nat what we're gonna see\n\n229\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.500\nwhen we start looking\nat these raw packets.\n\n230\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.750\nAll right, when we look at TCP header.\n\n231\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.580\nSo if we're talking about a TCP protocol,\n\n232\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.870\nand let's define that cuz I\ndon't think we've done that yet.\n\n233\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.910\nWe said ip is our internet protocol.\n\n234\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.560\nTCP is transmission control protocol.\n\n235\n00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.860\nTCP slash IP which most of\nyou have probably heard of\n\n236\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.650\nis actually a protocol suite\nmade up of several protocols.\n\n237\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.290\nTCP and UDP,\nTCP being transmission control protocol,\n\n238\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.300\nUDP being user datagram protocol.\n\n239\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.190\nThese are transport protocols,\nthese occur up at layer for, right?\n\n240\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.450\nWhere we're actually worried\nabout transportation,\n\n241\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.030\ngetting it from one end to the other.\n\n242\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.500\nAnd the information we're\ngonna find in those headers,\n\n243\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.110\nthat's getting added on, right?\n\n244\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.320\nWhen we look here,\nwhat is getting added in a TCP packet?\n\n245\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.990\nOr what's getting added in a UDP packet?\n\n246\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.700\nWhat can we look for?\n\n247\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.310\nWhat kind of information\ncan we get out of there?\n\n248\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.030\nWell in our TCP header,\nwe've got several bits of information.\n\n249\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.320\nWe've got a source port and\na destination port, right?\n\n250\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.100\nNotice there's no address, why not?\n\n251\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.670\nAny guesses?\n\n252\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.590\n&gt;&gt; I would say maybe because it hasn't\nbeen passed down to the layer with\n\n253\n00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.830\nthe addresses get at it on.\n\n254\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.020\nIt's just a guess.\n\n255\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit would be a very good educated guess.\n\n256\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.780\nHe's teasing you,\nhe knows all of these inside and out.\n\n257\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.136\nBut yes, it hasn't made it down\nto the addressing layer, right?\n\n258\n00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:30.275\nBut the port this is has to\ndo with the application and\n\n259\n00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:31.205\nthat's already known, right?\n\n260\n00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:34.365\nIt's already made it down from\nthe application session presentation\n\n261\n00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:35.855\ndown in the transport.\n\n262\n00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:39.395\nYou get your source port and\nyour destination port and\n\n263\n00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:44.005\nI written out like the bit numbers, so\nyou can see like the first 16 bits,\n\n264\n00:14:44.005 --> 00:14:49.130\n0 through 15 are what we're\ngonna use to identify\n\n265\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.500\nthe source port at the destination\nport will then would be 16 to 31.\n\n266\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.200\nSo the next 16 bits there,\nwe've got our sequence number and\n\n267\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.210\nwith TCP/IP or TCP specifically we\nput sequence numbers on there and\n\n268\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:09.100\nthe sequence numbers are what we used to\nhelp get the packets back in the right\n\n269\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.180\norder and make sure we've\ngot all the packets, right?\n\n270\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:18.600\nBecause TCP is what we call\na reliable transport protocol.\n\n271\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.980\nIn other words it has ways of validating\nmaking sure that the packets,\n\n272\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.475\nall of the packets arrived at the other\nend and when we send data out, right?\n\n273\n00:15:28.475 --> 00:15:31.000\nWith across the Internet for example.\n\n274\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.010\nNot every packet goes down the same path,\n\n275\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:38.300\nwe don't use as much any\ncircuit switched networks.\n\n276\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.800\nIf you have a dedicated lease line,\nthat might be a different story.\n\n277\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.286\nBut most of the time when we're\ngoing across the Internet\n\n278\n00:15:46.286 --> 00:15:50.523\nour packets take the best\nroute at the time.\n\n279\n00:15:50.523 --> 00:15:52.408\nSo as your package are hidden first\nrouter, some of them might go this way and\n\n280\n00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:53.823\nall over sudden then that\nstarts getting congested, and\n\n281\n00:15:53.823 --> 00:15:55.401\nthey rather decide there is\na better route going the other way.\n\n282\n00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:58.475\nSo some of the packets gets the other\nway I was thinking like it's a maze and\n\n283\n00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:01.253\nthey're all trying to get to the same\nend or in the same endpoint but\n\n284\n00:16:01.253 --> 00:16:02.660\nthey can go to different routes.\n\n285\n00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.440\nWhich means they might get\nthere at different times,\n\n286\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.242\nthey might get there out of order.\n\n287\n00:16:07.242 --> 00:16:12.571\nThe sequence of numbers is how we can\nend up putting those guys back together.\n\n288\n00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.737\nThe acknowledgement number,\n\n289\n00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:20.649\nthis is something that used because TCP is\nalso a connection-oriented protocol and\n\n290\n00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:24.990\nso what that means is TCP is\nconnection oriented, reliable.\n\n291\n00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.820\nIt means we're going to establish an\nactual session and we're going to verify\n\n292\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.760\nthat the packets made it to the other\nend and that they are intact.\n\n293\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.970\nThey're not modified,\nnothing got corrupt during transmission.\n\n294\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.100\nAnd if something is corrupt or\nit'll end up dropping,\n\n295\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.080\nit'll silently drop it and\nrequest that packet again.\n\n296\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.240\nBut the acknowledgement number\nis how the sending end knows\n\n297\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.370\nthat the receiving end got the packet,\nright?\n\n298\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.340\nSo I send data, I basically wait for the\nother end to tell me, okay, I've got that.\n\n299\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.280\nAnd now you can send the next one, right?\n\n300\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.750\nSo the acknowledgement number again\nis acknowledging a particular\n\n301\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.990\npack of sequence that was delivered.\n\n302\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.460\nHey, I've got this one.\n\n303\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.350\nLet's send the next one.\n\n304\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.330\nOkay, I've got this one.\n\n305\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.530\nSend the next one.\n\n306\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.660\nWe've got some more information.\n\n307\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.660\nData offset.\n\n308\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.460\nNow some of these are, I’m a little rusty.\n\n309\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.480\nData offset, when you fragment a packet.\n\n310\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.290\nAll right, sometimes again Ethernet has\nrules about how much data can be out\n\n311\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.080\ninto a packet.\n\n312\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.040\nI’ve got more data that will\nfit into a single packet or\n\n313\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.120\nshould I say a single frame.\n\n314\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.555\nIt will start, well now I take that back.\n\n315\n00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:36.580\nWe're talking about segments\nhere is what I should be saying.\n\n316\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.530\nAs we, if we have more information I\ncan put in a single segment, right,\n\n317\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.930\nwe'll have to break it up.\n\n318\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.460\nAnd then, at the other end,\nthey've gotta put it back together.\n\n319\n00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.910\nAnd the data offset is how\nit puts it back together.\n\n320\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.910\nIt tells, this frame or\n\n321\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:56.490\nthis segment starts at bit by I don't\nknow, 1532 or something like that,\n\n322\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.400\ntelling it hey, this is the next\nchunk in line from the beginning.\n\n323\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.140\nWhat is the offset, all right?\n\n324\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd you can imagine like\nlittle boxes getting lined up,\n\n325\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.110\nthat offset will tell you, hey,\nput this one way out here.\n\n326\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.210\nThis comes at this point.\n\n327\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.130\nGosh, I'm trying to think.\n\n328\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.230\nI'll have to look up res.\n\n329\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.820\nI wanna say it was reserved and\nit's actually not used.\n\n330\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.280\nBut I'll have to double-check\non that one for you guys.\n\n331\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.160\nFlags are another thing that\nwe use in TCP/IP or TCP.\n\n332\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.660\nWhen you send a packet,\nyou can raise certain flags.\n\n333\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.340\nThere's certain bits that I can turn on or\noff.\n\n334\n00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.832\nAnd I've got those listed\nout here off to the side.\n\n335\n00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:41.960\nThese guys, right here, are the six\nprimary flags that we deal with.\n\n336\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.877\nUrge, act push, reset, syn, and fin.\n\n337\n00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:53.471\nAnd I'll tell you urge and push,\nyou don't see them as much anymore.\n\n338\n00:18:53.471 --> 00:18:56.435\nUrg, was urgent was a way,\nif I set this flag,\n\n339\n00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:58.870\nthe packet could be marked as urgent.\n\n340\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.470\nHopefully, give it a little bit\nmore priority as it travelling.\n\n341\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.960\nThe push was a way to say, as soon\nas this gets filled up, send it, or\n\n342\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.830\nwith this data go ahead and send it.\n\n343\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.060\nDon't worry about filling\nthe segment up all the way.\n\n344\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.680\nAnd at the other end, the push would say,\ngive this to the application immediately.\n\n345\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.730\nDon't worry about trying to wait for\nanything else to put things back together.\n\n346\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.860\nGo ahead and push it through.\n\n347\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.598\nSee those being use that much anymore.\n\n348\n00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:27.040\nThe acknowledgement is,\nif you're sending an acknowledgment,\n\n349\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.750\nthat will get turned on.\n\n350\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:33.290\nThe SYN flag is a synchronization flag or\na Synchronization request.\n\n351\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.530\nWe'll come right back to that cuz\nI want to talk about the three way\n\n352\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.480\nhandshake with TCP.\n\n353\n00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.900\nThe RST is reset, and that's for\nresetting a connection.\n\n354\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.960\nAnd then the FIN is for\nfinishing a connection.\n\n355\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.580\nHey, there's no more data to be sent.\n\n356\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.670\nLet's go ahead.\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.910\nmark this as finished.\n\n358\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.838\nReset, you'll typically see when\na connection is no longer needed,\n\n359\n00:19:57.838 --> 00:20:02.508\nit can respond with a reset\nto basically start that over.\n\n360\n00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:06.444\nOr let's used a lot of times when we do\nping sweeps, if you ping an open port\n\n361\n00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:10.205\nversus a closed port, you're looking\nto see if you get a reset or not.\n\n362\n00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:13.256\nIt's kinda letting you know whether\nthat port's opening and listening or\n\n363\n00:20:13.256 --> 00:20:14.959\nwhether it's closed and not listening.\n\n364\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.830\nWhere was I going with that?\n\n365\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.950\nYeah, so those are six flags.\n\n366\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:20.630\nAnd I'll actually show you.\n\n367\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.890\nYou see that's what's really cool\nabout using something like Wire Chart.\n\n368\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.690\nYou can see all this.\n\n369\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.610\nThis is what's inside.\n\n370\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.580\nWhen we start looking at\nthe raw packet information.\n\n371\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.790\nNow, the two I really wanna focus on\nhere are gonna be the SYN and the ACK.\n\n372\n00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.920\nBecause these are important when\nwe're learning about TCP and\n\n373\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.010\nthe way this protocol works.\n\n374\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:43.560\nAnd what makes it connection oriented\nis what's known as the TCP three\n\n375\n00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.100\nway handshake, right?\n\n376\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.884\nThis is what allows the sending and\nreceiving node to establish a connection\n\n377\n00:20:49.884 --> 00:20:54.780\nso that they can start sending and\nreceiving data back and forth.\n\n378\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.758\nThe sending node, the originating node,\n\n379\n00:20:57.758 --> 00:21:02.070\nsends a packet to the destination and\nthe send flag is raised.\n\n380\n00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:07.320\nIn other words the bid for\nS-Y-N is turned on, it's a one, right?\n\n381\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.880\nWhen the other end gets that it's\nbasically saying, hey I wanna synchronize\n\n382\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.910\nwith you, I wanna get our numbers lined up\nso that we can start sending data back and\n\n383\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.860\nforth, and keep track of packets and\nput them back together properly.\n\n384\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.970\nSo let's synchronize.\n\n385\n00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.970\nIt's requesting a synchronization.\n\n386\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:21.850\nAnd there's a syn,\n\n387\n00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.110\nthere's a number that goes here, there's a\nsequence number that's gonna go in there.\n\n388\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.974\nHere's my sequence number that I'm on.\n\n389\n00:21:28.974 --> 00:21:32.254\nThe other end, the receiving end,\nreceives that syn flag,\n\n390\n00:21:32.254 --> 00:21:35.600\nthe flag where the syn flag raised and\nit's gonna respond with\n\n391\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.061\nan acknowledgement, saying hey, I got\nyour request for your synchronization.\n\n392\n00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:44.980\nI see your synchronization number, and\nI'm gonna acknowledge that, that I got it.\n\n393\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.890\nAnd I'm also gonna send you\na synchronization request.\n\n394\n00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.320\nSo the receiving end is acknowledging\nthe sync request that it got,\n\n395\n00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.390\nplus sending back its own send request.\n\n396\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.680\nAll right, that is known as the SYN ACK\npacket because there is a SYN and\n\n397\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.230\nan acknowledgement turned on.\n\n398\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.660\nBoth of those bits would be 1s.\n\n399\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.000\nThe original sending node that started\nthis whole thing receives that SYN ACK and\n\n400\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.790\nsays, okay thank you for\nacknowledging my synchronization request.\n\n401\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.870\nAnd I see your synchronization request,\nlet me go ahead and acknowledge you back\n\n402\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.880\nand it sends back an ACK packet, one\nwith the acknowledgement flag turned on.\n\n403\n00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.450\nSo there's three steps,\n\n404\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.670\nthere's a synchronization request,\nan acknowledgement and\n\n405\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.220\nanother synchronization request,\nand then a final acknowledgment.\n\n406\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.613\nAnd once those three steps take place and\nare successful,\n\n407\n00:22:37.613 --> 00:22:44.170\nwe now have a successful TCP session setup\nor we now have, yeah session setup, right?\n\n408\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.224\nAnd that's known as the TCP\nthree way handshake or\n\n409\n00:22:47.224 --> 00:22:50.880\nyou hear people talking as the SYN,\nSYN-ACK ACK, right?\n\n410\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.486\nBecause the first packet\nhad the SYN flag raised.\n\n411\n00:22:53.486 --> 00:22:55.860\nThe second one was the SYN and the ACK.\n\n412\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.970\nThe third one was the ACK.\n\n413\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.390\nSo, SYN, SYN ACK, ACK, to establish that.\n\n414\n00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.530\nSo, and like I said, we need to be\nable to look inside these packets.\n\n415\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.440\nWhy?\n\n416\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.440\nWell, because there's different\ntypes of attacks that can occur, and\n\n417\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.340\nif we know what we're looking for,\nwe can spot some of these.\n\n418\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.400\nFor example, there's what's\ncalled the SYN flood attack.\n\n419\n00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.950\nWhere I send multiple SYN requests and\nyou're in is going to be back SYN ACK\n\n420\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.010\nbecause that's the second step\nin the three-way handshake but\n\n421\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.910\nI'm never going to respond\nwith the final act, right?\n\n422\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.310\nAnd I can spoof all kinds of IP addresses\nto make it look like that this request is\n\n423\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.950\ncoming from different people and on your\nend, the receiving end he's done his job.\n\n424\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.180\nHe's done the SYN ACK and now he's waiting\nfor the third step which should be\n\n425\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.410\nthe other end sending an acknowledgement,\nbut it never comes.\n\n426\n00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.246\nBut it's just sitting there waiting.\n\n427\n00:23:43.246 --> 00:23:45.411\nAnd servers, for example, only have so\n\n428\n00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:50.131\nmuch memory that they can use to hold what\nthey call these half-open requests, right?\n\n429\n00:23:50.131 --> 00:23:53.945\nThey're unfinished Connection requests and\nif I can send enough\n\n430\n00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:57.774\nof them to your server,\nI could potentially run it out of memory.\n\n431\n00:23:57.774 --> 00:24:02.570\nAnd it can't accept anymore new requests\nbecause its waiting for a hundred and\n\n432\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.150\nthousands or whatever it is to\ntake you [INAUDIBLE] memory.\n\n433\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.650\nIt's waiting for\nall these half open request to finish, so\n\n434\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.360\nit can free them up and\nmove them to the connected, right?\n\n435\n00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.720\nInstead of just waiting.\n\n436\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.943\nSo that now Is not quiet\nas easy as it sounds,\n\n437\n00:24:16.943 --> 00:24:20.614\nthere is a lot more tricks\nto getting that to work.\n\n438\n00:24:20.614 --> 00:24:24.260\nThere's also a lot of defenses\nagainst attacks like that where we\n\n439\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.451\ncan routers now can see that there was\nnever an acknowledgement sent back.\n\n440\n00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:32.418\nOr really what these routers will do is,\nthey'll see the sin come in,\n\n441\n00:24:32.418 --> 00:24:36.253\nthey'll see the servers send back\nthe sin ac, they'll go ahead and\n\n442\n00:24:36.253 --> 00:24:38.830\nsend the final ac back\nto their owner server.\n\n443\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.200\nBecause it's not gonna hurt\nanything because the receiving and\n\n444\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.440\ngot the final acknowledgement.\n\n445\n00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.860\nHe thinks, great,\nwe've got our three way done.\n\n446\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.920\nFinally the receiving note, or the sending\nnote if it was legitimate does send an ac.\n\n447\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.750\nSo now it's got two acs for\nthe same synac.\n\n448\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.200\nBut that doesn't hurt anything.\n\n449\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.312\nAnd it allowed the server to free\nup that memory to get rid of that\n\n450\n00:24:59.312 --> 00:25:00.506\nhalf open connection.\n\n451\n00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:03.440\nAgain, that's probably more than\nwe need to know for this part.\n\n452\n00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.420\nBut it's just an example of why we\nneed to be able to look at these.\n\n453\n00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.230\nIf I see a lot of packets coming in and\nI see Syn, SIN/AC and no acknowledgement.\n\n454\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.340\nAnd the more Syn, SIN/ACK and\nno acknowledgements, no final acts.\n\n455\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:20.054\nThat could be an attempt for\nsomebody to do something malicious.\n\n456\n00:25:20.054 --> 00:25:23.465\nAll right, so\nwe our TCP header information,\n\n457\n00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:26.265\nI didn't finish going through here,\n\n458\n00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:32.228\nwindow size basically decides how much\ninformation can be put in to that packet.\n\n459\n00:25:32.228 --> 00:25:36.802\nYou get your header and data check sums,\nthese are basically hashes that allow me\n\n460\n00:25:36.802 --> 00:25:41.442\nto validate the information, make sure\nthat header wasn't modified in any way,\n\n461\n00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:45.810\neither maliciously or accidentally\nthe data itself is still intact.\n\n462\n00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.292\nRemember TCP is a reliable protocol,\nI wanna make sure that that\n\n463\n00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:55.276\ninformation gets to the other end as\naccurately as it was when I sent it.\n\n464\n00:25:55.276 --> 00:25:57.399\nWe've got an urgent pointer.\n\n465\n00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:01.374\nWhich really again isn't, if I'm not\nmistaken, it's not used much anymore,\n\n466\n00:26:01.374 --> 00:26:05.880\nbut it flags it as urgent, and then\nthere's some options that'd be configured.\n\n467\n00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.402\nWe're not gonna go into\nany of that just yet.\n\n468\n00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:11.237\nAll right, so now let's take a look\nat UDP, and we're gonna go in, and\n\n469\n00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.241\nI'm gonna show you actual packets,\nand we'll look at this information.\n\n470\n00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.791\nI just wanna go through this\nfirst to kind of prepare us so\n\n471\n00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:22.700\nwe know what we are looking at cuz it's\nnot in this pretty highlighted colored\n\n472\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.815\nformats when we're looking\nat the raw packets.\n\n473\n00:26:25.815 --> 00:26:31.710\nUDP, you can see is a little bit light\non the fields in that UDP header.\n\n474\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.870\nUDP, as I said earlier,\nis the User Datagram Protocol.\n\n475\n00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.055\nIt's another transport protocol\nused to move our data but\n\n476\n00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:40.005\nit's a little different from TCP.\n\n477\n00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:44.734\nIt is part of the TCP/IP suit\nof utilities or of protocols.\n\n478\n00:26:44.734 --> 00:26:50.410\nBut UDP is unreliable, connectionless.\n\n479\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.420\nWhere TCP is reliable,\nconnection oriented.\n\n480\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.120\nMeaning that we establish a session,\nwe keep track of\n\n481\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.560\nthe packets that we're sending, we're\nmaking sure they get to the other end.\n\n482\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.910\nUDP is basically send it and forget it.\n\n483\n00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.966\nIt's best effort.\n\n484\n00:27:03.966 --> 00:27:07.712\nI'm gonna send it, I'm gonna do\neverything I can to get it ready and\n\n485\n00:27:07.712 --> 00:27:12.140\nmake sure it's good to go and I'm gonna\nsend it but once I've sent it I'm good.\n\n486\n00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.633\nWell I hope it gets there,\nbest effort, right.\n\n487\n00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:16.916\nI'm not going to check\nto see if you've got it,\n\n488\n00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:20.356\nI'm not going to verify that it got\nthere intact or anything like that.\n\n489\n00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:24.030\nAll right, that is UDP or\nuser data protocol and\n\n490\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.486\nyou might think why the heck would\nwe ever wanna protocol like that,\n\n491\n00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:32.493\nwhat would we use it for\nwhy don't we use TCP for everything?\n\n492\n00:27:32.493 --> 00:27:36.556\nWell there's a lot of times,\nwhen we won't need that extra over head,\n\n493\n00:27:36.556 --> 00:27:37.854\nthat TCP introduces.\n\n494\n00:27:37.854 --> 00:27:40.910\nAll right, the delay, the way,\nI have to send packets,\n\n495\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.942\nand then wait for you to acknowledge them,\nbefore I can send more packets.\n\n496\n00:27:44.942 --> 00:27:48.068\nRight, with TCP, with UDP,\nI can, boom boom boom,\n\n497\n00:27:48.068 --> 00:27:50.980\nsend them out there as\nfast as I can get them.\n\n498\n00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.880\nHope they get there, and\n\n499\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:57.110\nI really do hope they get there, but if\nthey don't I'm sorry, but it'll be okay.\n\n500\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you know,\none of the things I think of, Mike,\n\n501\n00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:03.924\nyou know when I'm talking about TCP or\nUDP I think of things like TCP.\n\n502\n00:28:03.924 --> 00:28:06.200\nSo why do we need connection\noriented services?\n\n503\n00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.981\nWell if you think about it, traditional\nprotocols like file transfer protocol,\n\n504\n00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:13.650\nFTP, they need to be connection oriented\nbecause you want to get those files and\n\n505\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.490\nyou don't want them corrupted right?\n\n506\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.115\nSo you want connection oriented.\n\n507\n00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:20.505\nBut if I've got something like\na voice over protocol session,\n\n508\n00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:25.555\na voip session, I don't need to rebuild\npackets as much as it's time sensitive.\n\n509\n00:28:25.555 --> 00:28:27.103\nAnd I need to get them there fast.\n\n510\n00:28:27.103 --> 00:28:28.436\nSo like Mike was saying,\n\n511\n00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:32.382\nall that extra stuff that's in TCP is\ngonna take a little a bit to process.\n\n512\n00:28:32.382 --> 00:28:36.267\nAnd when you need that real time\ninformation, newer protocols, like VoIP,\n\n513\n00:28:36.267 --> 00:28:38.440\ndo better with a little\nbit of packet lost.\n\n514\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.790\nNot worrying about what\ngot lost in the wash.\n\n515\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.216\nJust give them to me really fast.\n\n516\n00:28:42.216 --> 00:28:45.715\nSo, you could see why somebody\nmight use the UDP because, well,\n\n517\n00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:47.951\nthere's a less information to process.\n\n518\n00:28:47.951 --> 00:28:48.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n519\n00:28:48.725 --> 00:28:51.718\nYou're talking about voice and\nsure if I lose a packet,\n\n520\n00:28:51.718 --> 00:28:53.830\nit's gonna make it sound a little bad.\n\n521\n00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.430\nThere might be a little pop or crackle or\n\n522\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.100\nsomething or I might miss\na little bit in the conversation.\n\n523\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.360\nBut it's much better than\nslowing everything down and\n\n524\n00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.190\nhaving to wait for each one.\n\n525\n00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.530\nI don't have time for that, right?\n\n526\n00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.530\nIt's not like Wes said,\nit's a great example with the file.\n\n527\n00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.570\nI'm downloading a file all these\npackets are getting stacked up,\n\n528\n00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.882\nthe files getting rebuilt.\n\n529\n00:29:12.882 --> 00:29:16.322\nIf the first one's there, the last one's\nthere the middle one's are missing I don't\n\n530\n00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:19.960\ncare I'm gonna wait until everything gets\nhere before I try to open the file anyway.\n\n531\n00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.780\nWith voice I need it as it's\ncoming in as fast as possible.\n\n532\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.890\nStreaming media is another one where we'll\nsee udp being used because same thing,\n\n533\n00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.854\nour video that you've watching it might\ncrackle or pop if you drop a few packets,\n\n534\n00:29:33.854 --> 00:29:34.885\nbut it's okay.\n\n535\n00:29:34.885 --> 00:29:37.309\nWhere as if it's a file and\nI drop a few packets,\n\n536\n00:29:37.309 --> 00:29:39.200\nthere's chunks of my file missing.\n\n537\n00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.360\nThat's not gonna work out too well, right?\n\n538\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.088\nSo yeah, definitely use for udp.\n\n539\n00:29:43.088 --> 00:29:45.399\nIt's when you don't need\nthat extra overhead and\n\n540\n00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.330\nyou can get away with\na few missed packets.\n\n541\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.520\nIt's again, connectionless.\n\n542\n00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.064\nMeaning, we're not\nestablishing a connection.\n\n543\n00:29:52.064 --> 00:29:53.353\nI'm not checking with the other end.\n\n544\n00:29:53.353 --> 00:29:56.419\nAnd doing a three way handshake and\nintroducing myself.\n\n545\n00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:58.105\nI'm just sending them and\nhoping they get there.\n\n546\n00:29:58.105 --> 00:30:00.720\nYou might not even be online.\n\n547\n00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.402\nWhen we do, what's another one,\n\n548\n00:30:02.402 --> 00:30:05.306\nI think some of the mail delivery\nwill be done through that.\n\n549\n00:30:05.306 --> 00:30:07.938\nBecause it's a forwarding,\nit's able to hold onto it and\n\n550\n00:30:07.938 --> 00:30:09.882\nforward it when the other end gets online.\n\n551\n00:30:09.882 --> 00:30:13.690\nSo that's UDP or User Datagram Protocol.\n\n552\n00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.495\nAnd you can see in the packet.\n\n553\n00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.120\nIf we take a look at my screen here.\n\n554\n00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.880\nDefinitely not as much\ninformation up in that header.\n\n555\n00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.780\nWe've got our source port,\nour destination port, our length, and\n\n556\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.400\nthen our header and data checks them.\n\n557\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.927\nAnd that's all we're gonna\nfind in that UDP header.\n\n558\n00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:34.208\nAnother analogy just in case, I know this\nis one that comes harkens back in the days\n\n559\n00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:39.110\nof good old Network Plus, if you've been\nstudying for any of those comp TA exams.\n\n560\n00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.600\nWas the mail system, right?\n\n561\n00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.870\nWhen you do the regular US postal mail,\nyou'll throw that envelope in\n\n562\n00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:50.390\nyour mailbox, you thow the flag up and you\nhope the mailman comes by and picks it up.\n\n563\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:54.060\nAnd you hope it makes it to the end\nwhich you have no way of knowing, right?\n\n564\n00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.250\nNothing that you did there.\n\n565\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.470\nI mean, you can call the person,\n\n566\n00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.250\nyou can go out of band and\nyou can do some follow up on your own.\n\n567\n00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.884\nBut you don't really have any way of\nverifying that that letter got delivered,\n\n568\n00:31:03.884 --> 00:31:08.510\nso that would be UDP, is the same thing\nas snail mail or good old US postal mail.\n\n569\n00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.600\nAnd I don't mean that that\nyou guys are slow, USPS.\n\n570\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.886\nI really enjoy your services.\n\n571\n00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:20.344\nAnd then TCP connection oriented reliable\nit's more like registered mail, all right?\n\n572\n00:31:20.344 --> 00:31:23.918\nI'm going to take this letter down to the\nPost Office and I'm going to tell them,\n\n573\n00:31:23.918 --> 00:31:25.876\nI want this to be signed for\nat the other end.\n\n574\n00:31:25.876 --> 00:31:29.095\nAnd when they send that,\nthere has to be a receiver.\n\n575\n00:31:29.095 --> 00:31:33.210\nSomebody has to sign for it at the other\nend saying, yes, we received it.\n\n576\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.670\nWe've got this, all right?\n\n577\n00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.960\nThat's that connection oriented,\nreliable delivery.\n\n578\n00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.950\nSo that would be more like TCP.\n\n579\n00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.330\n&gt;&gt; And adding something like delivery\nconfirmation, right, may be because it\n\n580\n00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.605\ntells the end, you sent me a letter,\nyou went through all that extra paperwork.\n\n581\n00:31:48.605 --> 00:31:51.773\nPaied a little extra money but\nyou want to know that,\n\n582\n00:31:51.773 --> 00:31:53.794\nhey I got that letter it arrived.\n\n583\n00:31:53.794 --> 00:31:57.928\nIn the state that it was supposed to so\nyou get something like delivery\n\n584\n00:31:57.928 --> 00:32:02.932\nconfirmation on the carrier says hey hey\nMike yeah, we delivered that mail to Wes.\n\n585\n00:32:02.932 --> 00:32:06.734\nNow obviously I know that the other end\nof the recipients is not gonna do that,\n\n586\n00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:09.326\nit's more the network\nprotocol TCP that does that.\n\n587\n00:32:09.326 --> 00:32:10.494\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n588\n00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:12.406\nAll right West,\nwe got a few more to go through but\n\n589\n00:32:12.406 --> 00:32:14.425\nI do think we're getting\nclose on time aren't we?\n\n590\n00:32:14.425 --> 00:32:17.772\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah you guys couldn't see\nme given him the evil eye on that one,\n\n591\n00:32:17.772 --> 00:32:20.172\nI was too busy talking and\nchewing up that clock as well.\n\n592\n00:32:20.172 --> 00:32:24.007\nSo like you guys see, we are coming\nto the end of another episode, but\n\n593\n00:32:24.007 --> 00:32:27.530\nwe do have a lot more to go when\nwe look at protocols and packets.\n\n594\n00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.107\nWe got a nice little list here that\nyou guys are gonna have to understand.\n\n595\n00:32:31.107 --> 00:32:35.016\nSo Mike, we'll go ahead, and how about\nwe just call this one quits here, and\n\n596\n00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:37.795\nwe'll come back with a packet or\ntwo, a packet or two.\n\n597\n00:32:37.795 --> 00:32:38.443\n&gt;&gt; A packet two, I like that.\n\n598\n00:32:38.443 --> 00:32:41.450\n&gt;&gt; A packet two, how about a episode two.\n\n599\n00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.920\nSo, Mike, as always, we appreciate you\nbeing here in the studios with us and\n\n600\n00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.540\nwe do appreciate you\nthe viewer out there watching.\n\n601\n00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.843\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here for ITPro.TV.\n\n602\n00:32:50.843 --> 00:32:52.470\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n603\n00:32:52.470

continuing through our\n\n8\n00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.210\nGIAC Security Essentials, GSEC.\n\n9\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.765\nAnd joining us inside of the [LAUGH]\nstudio today is none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:25.570\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.500\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes, thanks for\n\n13\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.440\nhaving me back and yep, continuing\non with good old GSEC, fun stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.640\nIn these previous episodes,\nwe were looking at packets,\n\n15\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.090\nright, we were actually\nlooking at raw packets.\n\n16\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.140\nWe started out looking at IP,\nthe protocol,\n\n17\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.400\nwe talked about how it\nworked a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.120\nWe talked about the OSI model,\n\n19\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.730\nwe compared it with the TCP/IP model,\nthe four layers versus the seven layers.\n\n20\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600\nAnd we started looking at some of the\ninformation we're gonna see in the headers\n\n21\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.210\nof these packets as far an IP packet,\nor the IP header, the TCP header.\n\n22\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.140\nAnd we left off there I think,\nso let's go back to that.\n\n23\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.236\nWe'll do a little flashback and\ntake a look and\n\n24\n00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.076\nwe still need to look at that TCP header.\n\n25\n00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:08.210\nWe also need to look at a UDP header and\nan ICMP header.\n\n26\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.290\nAnd then what I wanna do is,\nat some point,\n\n27\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.630\nget into a couple of actual\npacket capture utilities.\n\n28\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.470\nWe're gonna demonstrate Wireshark and\nanother one called TCPDumper.\n\n29\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.480\nI'm gonna be using WinDump cuz I got\na Windows machine here, but same thing.\n\n30\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.272\nAnd we'll talk more about\nthat as we get there.\n\n31\n00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:26.928\nSo let's go back to our headers, cuz we\nneed to understand what information is in\n\n32\n00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:30.290\nthese headers, know where to look for\nthis information.\n\n33\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.539\nThen we'll capture some packets and we'll\nlook at how we can read the packets and\n\n34\n00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.486\neven do some hex decoding, woohoo!\n\n35\n00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.045\nAll right, so back to TCP again,\n\n36\n00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.840\nI'm pretty sure we looked at\nthis in the previous episode.\n\n37\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.473\nSo the real quick rehash,\nsource port, destination port,\n\n38\n00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:46.976\npretty straightforward there, right.\n\n39\n00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.814\nLet's back up,\nlet's not say that's straightforward.\n\n40\n00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:53.400\nLet's make sure we're aware of what\nthey mean by that port number.\n\n41\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.767\nWe know, we've talked about the fact\nthat a node needs an address.\n\n42\n00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.555\nJust like when you mail somebody a letter\nor postcard, you need the address so\n\n43\n00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:02.373\nthat it can get to that destination.\n\n44\n00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:06.982\nYou need a return address if they're gonna\nbe sending a postcard back or replying.\n\n45\n00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:09.683\nSame thing in computers,\nour computers need addresses.\n\n46\n00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.885\nWe've talked about the IPv4,\nwe've talked about IPv6,\n\n47\n00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:15.720\nas our two addressing schemes\nthat we use currently.\n\n48\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.710\nBut when we establish a socket, and\na socket is basically a TCP connection,\n\n49\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.030\nthere's really three\nthings that are involved.\n\n50\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.980\nAnd I shouldn't say a TCP connection,\nit's really any connection.\n\n51\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.430\nBut there's three things involved\nwhen you create a socket,\n\n52\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.280\nwhich is a connection between two nodes.\n\n53\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.336\nThat's protocol, IP address,\nand port number.\n\n54\n00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:39.800\nRight, protocol might be TCP.\n\n55\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.414\nAddress might be,\nit would be the destination address,\n\n56\n00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:45.692\nthe one you're trying to connect to,\n192.168.10.24.\n\n57\n00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:49.835\nAnd then the port number, colon, after\nthe address, colon and then a port number.\n\n58\n00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:54.954\nAnd a node has 65,535 ports and\nyou can think of\n\n59\n00:02:54.954 --> 00:03:01.246\neach one of those ports,\nthat's right, I said 65,535.\n\n60\n00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:07.671\nAnd each one of those ports you could\nconsider a doorway into your computer.\n\n61\n00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:12.661\nIt's what allows your computer, or\nmore specifically, our networking stack,\n\n62\n00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:14.123\nto multitask, right?\n\n63\n00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:17.888\nIf you have multiple applications open,\nyou've got your email application open,\n\n64\n00:03:17.888 --> 00:03:19.970\nyou're sending and receiving emails.\n\n65\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.420\nYou also have your browser open and\nyou're pulling down web pages.\n\n66\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.046\nYou might also have a file transfer going\non, maybe you're going to get the latest\n\n67\n00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:31.281\nISO for some Linux or what have you,\nall this is going on.\n\n68\n00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:35.786\nWell all that data that's coming into your\nsystem is coming into the same address.\n\n69\n00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:37.900\nRight, you've got one\naddress on your system.\n\n70\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.278\nSo when that packet comes in and\nthis little bit of data, right,\n\n71\n00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:44.640\nthat we've chopped it up and\nbroke it into those little frames and\n\n72\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.330\nsent it along the way, when that gets to\nyour computer, where does it go, right?\n\n73\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.810\nIt's that port number that tells me,\nthat's port 80, that's web traffic,\n\n74\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.050\nthat's going to my browser.\n\n75\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.773\nThat's the default application anyway for\nthat port 80 traffic.\n\n76\n00:03:57.773 --> 00:04:00.473\nIt's 110 or 25, okay, that's mail traffic,\n\n77\n00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.210\nthat's going to that mail application,\nright?\n\n78\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.170\nSo it allows our networking\nstack basically to multitask and\n\n79\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.410\nto be doing more than one\nthing at the same time.\n\n80\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.580\nWe’ll come back and we’ll talk a little\nbit more about those port numbers,\n\n81\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.480\ncuz we wanna define a couple\nranges in there as well.\n\n82\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.057\nBut in our TCP header,\nthat’s what they’re referring to.\n\n83\n00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:24.804\nWhen they say source port and\ndestination port, well that’s the port\n\n84\n00:04:24.804 --> 00:04:28.640\nthe data's coming from,\nwhatever the sending node port it's using.\n\n85\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.080\nAnd then the receiving node,\nthe destination port.\n\n86\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.250\nThe sequence number, I think we\ntalked about that as well, again,\n\n87\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.420\njust doing a rehash.\n\n88\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:43.760\nThat's how we put the TCP segments\nback together on the receiving end.\n\n89\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.000\nIt's also how we can tell that\nthe traffic belongs to this conversation.\n\n90\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.820\nBecause there is an order to\nthe sequence number, and after you've\n\n91\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.180\nsent me one packet, that next packet,\nthere's an expected sequence number to it.\n\n92\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.910\nAnd if the other end\ndoesn't get it right or\n\n93\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.180\nif the packet coming in is not at\nthe right sequence number, that's\n\n94\n00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.120\nsomething that's gonna tell my computer\nhey, something's up, something's wrong.\n\n95\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.300\nThat is not coming from the same person,\nor\n\n96\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.380\nit's got the wrong sequence number\non there, we can drop that.\n\n97\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.894\nWhich leads me to a whole nother\nconversation that we need to have.\n\n98\n00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:16.370\nBut I think we'll save that for,\n\n99\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.169\nwe've got another one we're\ngonna talk about different types\n\n100\n00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.170\nof attacks cuz there's a lot of attacks\nthat use that, man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n101\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.970\nAnd one of the most famous ones,\n\n102\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.390\nthe Mitnick,\nI'm gonna say this name wrong, Shimomura.\n\n103\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.160\nI'll get that name right\nbefore we get to that episode.\n\n104\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.860\nBut the big attack that Kevin Mitnick\nwas responsible for, the hack that he,\n\n105\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.380\nI guess we don't have to say\nallegedly because he did the time.\n\n106\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.820\n[LAUGH] And I'm pretty sure he\nadmits to actually doing this.\n\n107\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.820\nBut one of the things that he\nused was sequence numbers.\n\n108\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.882\nI'll show you how, or\ntell you how, in a little while.\n\n109\n00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:56.360\nAcknowledgement number, we talked\nabout how TCP is a reliable protocol.\n\n110\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.440\nThat means that that packet gets there,\n\n111\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.430\nI've got to acknowledge\nthat I got that packet.\n\n112\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.700\nThose are gonna have\nan order to them as well.\n\n113\n00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.071\nAnd then you got your data offset, your\nreserved space, which is always a zero.\n\n114\n00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:13.460\nYou got your flags, and we mentioned\nthose, urge, act, push, reset, send, fin.\n\n115\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.895\nI don't think I told you what those did,\nwe'll talk a little bit more about those.\n\n116\n00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:23.120\nWindow size, because sometimes we can end\nup using what they call sliding windows.\n\n117\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.860\nIf the receiving end can handle\nmore data per packet, and\n\n118\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.600\nit's still inside the legal rules for\nthe protocol, we can adjust that.\n\n119\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.440\nIf they can't receive data fast enough,\nI can send\n\n120\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.650\na lot faster than they can receive,\nwe could slide those windows down.\n\n121\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.110\nHeader and data checksums for verifying\nthat the data still has integrity.\n\n122\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.918\nThe urgent pointer to mark flag or\nthat packet or that segment as urgent.\n\n123\n00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:47.230\nAnd then there's some options that\ncan be configured that we're not\n\n124\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.952\nconcerned with here.\n\n125\n00:06:47.952 --> 00:06:52.120\nAll right, so we talked about that,\nnow let's look at, and I believe we also,\n\n126\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.790\ndid we do the UDP as well?\n\n127\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.991\nOkay, so I'm basically just repeating\nthe last episode, let's move on.\n\n128\n00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:00.966\nUDP was pretty straightforward, source and\ndestination port, length, and header and\n\n129\n00:07:00.966 --> 00:07:02.330\ndata checksum.\n\n130\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.070\nAnd then we've got our ICMP header, and\nthis one we haven't talked about yet.\n\n131\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.950\nICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol,\nright?\n\n132\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.230\nThis is a type of packet that\nwe can send that, really,\n\n133\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.720\nwe use it a lot for\ntesting network connectivity.\n\n134\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.990\nRight, you guys have heard of pinging, or\n\n135\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.030\nif you ping a destination to see if\nit's up, to see if it's responding.\n\n136\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.419\nUse it to test for live hosts on\na network when we're doing ping sweeps.\n\n137\n00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.447\nWe use it for for troubleshooting,\nhey I can't get to the file server,\n\n138\n00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:31.417\nI ping its IP address.\n\n139\n00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:36.674\nWell it's up, it's responding, so\nsomething else is the problem.\n\n140\n00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:40.650\nThere's several different\ncodes that go along with ICMP.\n\n141\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.958\nWe were talking about number 8?\n\n142\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:44.691\nIs that right Wes?\n\n143\n00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:45.443\nDo you remember?\n\n144\n00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:48.490\n&gt;&gt; No, I-\n&gt;&gt; 8 is the echo in echo request?\n\n145\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.115\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, yep.\n\n146\n00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:53.750\n&gt;&gt; So type 8, there's different, and\nthat is what this is for, the type and\n\n147\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.674\nthe code determine what type.\n\n148\n00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:59.189\nCuz it also can be used for\nsynchronization and\n\n149\n00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:01.180\na couple of other things.\n\n150\n00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.423\nBut primarily what we're using ICMP for\nis For\n\n151\n00:08:04.423 --> 00:08:07.928\nnetwork connectivity tests,\nthings like that.\n\n152\n00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:12.350\nChecksums, I never really\nunderstood why we got the checksum.\n\n153\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.730\nI guess to make sure the ICMP\nheader format still has integrity.\n\n154\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.630\nThere's not a lot of data\ninvolved in an ICMP packet.\n\n155\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.150\nAlthough don't be fooled\nthinking that it can't hold data,\n\n156\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.935\nall right,\nbecause a ping packet can hold data.\n\n157\n00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:28.830\nThere is a payload area.\n\n158\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.869\nI wanna say it'll hold up to\nlike 50 some odd bytes in there.\n\n159\n00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:39.476\nAnd it can be used maliciously because\nwe're not expecting a ping packet to have\n\n160\n00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:42.535\na payload, but they do have payload areas.\n\n161\n00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:45.625\nAs well, a lot of companies will\nblock pings because of some denial\n\n162\n00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.265\nservice attacks can be\nused using pings and\n\n163\n00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:54.065\nbecause we can use it as\na covert channel to move data.\n\n164\n00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:56.510\nNobody's looking inside\nthose ping packets.\n\n165\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.750\n&gt;&gt; You had mentioned a format\ninside of the TCP header.\n\n166\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.670\nAnd it made me think of ICMP because of\nthe fact that it's used to slow down.\n\n167\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.280\nYou said, if we've got stuff that's\nsitting in that network buffer with\n\n168\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.400\nthe buffer on the network adapter and\nit can't process information fast enough.\n\n169\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.372\nWell, what's it gonna do?\n\n170\n00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:14.240\nIt's gonna call back to the source and\nit's gonna, hey,\n\n171\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.110\nslow down here a little bit.\n\n172\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.040\nAnd that's essentially what ICMP is doing.\n\n173\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.120\nMaking sure that you got even-flow control\non that network so that if you are in\n\n174\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.400\ndanger of dropping packets, again\nthe buffer's getting full at about 75%.\n\n175\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.820\nThat network buffer fires off\na signal back to the source and\n\n176\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.640\nsays, hold on a second, you gotta\nslow down, I can't keep up with you.\n\n177\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.390\nKinda like when I talk\na little bit too fast,\n\n178\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.850\nMike's gotta say, well hold on a second,\nlet's just stand back and\n\n179\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.420\nlet's consider what's being\nmentioned right here.\n\n180\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.110\nWell, it's the same thing that\nthe internet control message protocol\n\n181\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.430\nhelps us do, right?\n\n182\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.300\nHelps us to keep those\npackets flowing evenly and\n\n183\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.010\nmaking sure that we're\nnot dropping packets.\n\n184\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n185\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.200\nIt was, what,\na squelch I think they called it?\n\n186\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.650\nIn fact,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n187\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.430\nI pulled up a page from IANA, the Internet\nAuthority of Names and Addresses.\n\n188\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.640\nDid I get that right?\n\n189\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.790\nInternet assigned numbers authority.\n\n190\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, there we go.\n\n191\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.380\nI always get those backwards when\nWes is here to fix me on those.\n\n192\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.140\nAnd, let me zoom in just a wee bit, of\ncourse I didn't get it to zoom it running.\n\n193\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.070\nAlways and\nforever having an issue with that program.\n\n194\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:18.890\nI love that program.\n\n195\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.860\nIt doesn't like to start up automatically.\n\n196\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.777\nSo let's fire that up so we can\nactually see what Mike is referring to.\n\n197\n00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:30.420\nOne day I'll double check\nthat before our show starts.\n\n198\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.390\nThere we go.\nAnd\n\n199\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.740\nthese are some of the different echo type.\n\n200\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.650\nAnd by no means you have to\nmemorize this list for the exam.\n\n201\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.995\nI just wanted to show you when it\nsays type in that header field,\n\n202\n00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:41.095\nthis is what it's referring to.\n\n203\n00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:44.475\nAnd you can see about halfway\ndown that list, Type 8- Echo.\n\n204\n00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:50.075\nThat's the one we're typically using but\nyou might want to look at this.\n\n205\n00:10:50.075 --> 00:10:53.110\nAnd when you're doing your\npacket capturing, and\n\n206\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.140\nyou're seeing different\ntypes of packets go by, and\n\n207\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.190\nyou know you don't use ICMP\n4 timestamp information.\n\n208\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.820\nAnd you see some type 13s going by.\n\n209\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.080\nYou can make firewall rules\nto block that kind of thing.\n\n210\n00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.730\nBut you wanna allow type 8 ICMP\npackets cuz those are echos and\n\n211\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.990\nyou do use those for testing connectivity.\n\n212\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.870\nI'm saying you might use those, right?\n\n213\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.980\nSo just to understand that there\nare different types involved with those\n\n214\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.190\nInternet Control Message Protocol or\nICMP packets.\n\n215\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.870\nAll right, and\nwe also looked I believe at the IP,\n\n216\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.400\nmaybe not,\nmaybe we didn't look at the IP header yet.\n\n217\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.559\nSo let's take a look at this one.\n\n218\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.920\nIP, right?\n\n219\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.230\nOur internet protocol.\n\n220\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.620\nWe got your version, your header length.\n\n221\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.570\nI'll just kind of go across the top there.\n\n222\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.790\nService type, total length.\n\n223\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.880\nIdentification, flags.\n\n224\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.060\nFragment offset for when we have to\nbreak it up into smaller pieces.\n\n225\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.060\nI've got a TTL there,\nwhich is a time to live.\n\n226\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.490\nTells me how many hops basically that\npacket can take before it's dropped.\n\n227\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.770\nYour protocol, header checksum for\nchecking to make sure we have integrity.\n\n228\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:01.080\nAnd then source IP address and destination\nIP address and then options and padding.\n\n229\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.190\nAnd the two big ones there is that source\nIP address and destination IP address.\n\n230\n00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.870\nCuz if you go back to TCP, all right,\n\n231\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.620\nnowhere on here did we have a source\naddress and destination address.\n\n232\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.870\nWe've got source port,\ndestination port, but\n\n233\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.845\nI don't have any type of IP address,\nwhere's the address?\n\n234\n00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:23.460\nRemember that's IP's job,\nIP is responsible for\n\n235\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.820\nsetting the addressing as well as\ndoing the routing of these packets,\n\n236\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.930\nor helping with the routing\nof these packets.\n\n237\n00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.860\nSo as it's falling down through\nthat OSI model, transport layer,\n\n238\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.240\nthat's where my transports\nprotocols like TCP and UDP occur.\n\n239\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.010\nAnd the same thing with UDP.\n\n240\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.080\nAll right,\nwe don't have an address on here yet.\n\n241\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.530\nThat's the next layer down.\n\n242\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.410\nWe get into that networking layer.\n\n243\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.680\nThat's where IP resides and\nthat's where the actual source and\n\n244\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.950\ndestination address are appended\nto that packet in the IP header.\n\n245\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.590\nAnd remember that gets wrapped out\nin front, so I've got my TCP header.\n\n246\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.410\nBut that information just comes straight\ndown here, and then out in front of that\n\n247\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:06.360\nis the IP header where I've got the source\naddress and that destination address.\n\n248\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.840\nSo a lot of different information that's\nfound in these packets for this exam.\n\n249\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.690\nDo study up on this a little bit,\n\n250\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.905\nit's one of those things that\nwe don't deal with all the time.\n\n251\n00:13:16.905 --> 00:13:23.075\nAnd so you're gonna wanna know where\nsome of these fields are within these,\n\n252\n00:13:23.075 --> 00:13:25.305\nwhen we're looking at that\nraw packet information.\n\n253\n00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.319\nI'll make this spreadsheet available.\n\n254\n00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:30.667\nWe'll make sure we make it\navailable with the show notes so\n\n255\n00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:35.825\nthat you guys can use this to study\nfrom as you wanna break those down.\n\n256\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.490\nAll right, next thing I do want to\ntalk about Wes is actually going to be\n\n257\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.410\nour IP service ports, right?\n\n258\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.855\nWe talked a little bit ago about\nhow there's 65,535 ports, and\n\n259\n00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:53.335\neach one of those is\nbasically a doorway in.\n\n260\n00:13:53.335 --> 00:13:56.045\nCuz technically your computer\ncould make a connection,\n\n261\n00:13:56.045 --> 00:14:00.245\na socket, on each one of those\nports to different addresses.\n\n262\n00:14:00.245 --> 00:14:03.840\nSo it could be connected multiple times,\nobviously 65,000\n\n263\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.430\nconnections would be a lot to your\ncomputer, it would probably be swamped.\n\n264\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.379\nBut the point is theoretically\neach one of those is a doorway in,\n\n265\n00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.219\njust not all at the same time.\n\n266\n00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:16.530\nAnd it's important that we understand\nthe ranges of these ports.\n\n267\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.211\nThe way they are defined by the IANA.\n\n268\n00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:25.030\nThe first 1,024, the first 1,024 ports,\n\n269\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:31.260\nwhich means port 0 through 1,023,\ndon't forget about port 0,\n\n270\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.060\nthe first 1,024, 0 to 1,023,\nare my well known ports, right?\n\n271\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.280\nI don't know why I'm getting\na brain cramp there.\n\n272\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.310\nThese are my well known ports.\n\n273\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.380\nAnd these are ones that have really\nbeen assigned to particular jobs.\n\n274\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.927\nLike port 80, is for\nHTTP traffic and port 443 is for\n\n275\n00:14:50.927 --> 00:14:56.140\nHTTPS, port 25 is SMTP,\nport 20 and 21 is FTP.\n\n276\n00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.390\nWe could go on and on and on.\n\n277\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.860\nNo, I don't know all 1,023.\n\n278\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.420\nThat's, or 24, that's Wes' job over there.\n\n279\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.190\nHe knows them all.\n\n280\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.350\nSo start at 1 and\ngo on through the list there, Wes.\n\n281\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.396\n&gt;&gt; 1 second, gonna have to\nslow down to catch all those.\n\n282\n00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:12.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you didn't catch that,\n\n283\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.920\nhe went through all 1,023 right then and\nthere.\n\n284\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.850\nNo, I'm kidding, you obviously don't need\nto memorize all 1,024 of these ports.\n\n285\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.941\nOr, I keep saying 1,023, 1,024.\n\n286\n00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.300\nWe'll use 1,024 for nice, round numbers.\n\n287\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.420\nYou don't need to know all those ports.\n\n288\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.070\nYou should definitely know\nthe common ones though.\n\n289\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:35.074\nI'm talking about web, and\nsecure web, and DNS, and DHCP.\n\n290\n00:15:35.074 --> 00:15:40.312\nLet's say DNS 53, DHCP 67,\nSecure web traffic 443,\n\n291\n00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:45.450\nNetBIOS137, those kind of\nports we need to understand,\n\n292\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.787\nwe need to know those, so\nthat when you look into the traffic and\n\n293\n00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:56.120\nwhen you look in to that data,\nyou understand what that is.\n\n294\n00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.953\nOr if you're responsible\nsetting a firewall.\n\n295\n00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:00.278\nAll right, the boss comes to you and says,\n\n296\n00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:03.711\nlook we don't want any ftp traffic\ncoming from the outside in.\n\n297\n00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:07.409\nOkay, great, I'll go write a firewall\nrule to block FTP traffic.\n\n298\n00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:09.334\nWell, I better know the port number,\n\n299\n00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:13.080\nbecause that's how I'm gonna tell\nthat firewall what to block, right?\n\n300\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.390\nIs by that associated port number.\n\n301\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Let me give you a classic example.\n\n302\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.450\nEarlier today,\nyou might be watching this recorded.\n\n303\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.300\nBut earlier today we were actually talking\nabout that very thing, Mike, when it comes\n\n304\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.060\nto doing full zone transfers,\nbetween a primary and a secondary server.\n\n305\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.340\nAnd that's one of the things that our\nother host, Don had mentioned that.\n\n306\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.325\nYou could potentially have to\nopen port 50 TCP, the port 53,\n\n307\n00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:41.335\nin order to do one of those zone transfers\nbetween your primary and master.\n\n308\n00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.425\nSo you can see or your, excuse me,\nI'm sorry, your primary and\n\n309\n00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:45.095\nyour secondary DNS server.\n\n310\n00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:48.835\nSo you can see in a situation like that\nand especially something like G-sec,\n\n311\n00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:50.345\nwhere it's security related.\n\n312\n00:16:50.345 --> 00:16:53.205\nYeah, it's all about knowing those\nports for the firewall for sure.\n\n313\n00:16:53.205 --> 00:16:53.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n314\n00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:58.305\nThey could of asked you directly hey,\nwhat's the port for secure web traffic?\n\n315\n00:16:58.305 --> 00:16:59.445\nProbably not.\n\n316\n00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:02.983\nThey might say that hey,\nJoe Admin, set up some rules or\n\n317\n00:17:02.983 --> 00:17:08.269\nis gonna set up some rules for allowing\nsecure traffic, which rules should he use?\n\n318\n00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:09.951\nAnd then they'll give\nyou a couple rules and\n\n319\n00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.510\nyou gotta pick the one that has\nthe right port number in it, right?\n\n320\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.090\nSo knowing the port number\nis definitely be beneficial.\n\n321\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:18.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and I guess you could\nlook at that right from an administrative\n\n322\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.724\nand even a tech perspective, right?\n\n323\n00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:23.341\nIf you're running some kind of software\nscouring your network, you're gonna wanna\n\n324\n00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:26.720\nget a feel for one of the machines and\nservices that are running on your network.\n\n325\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.390\nThey're commonly identified by these TCP,\nUDP ports, right?\n\n326\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.570\nSo for instance,\nif I do a scan across the network.\n\n327\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.380\nI see port 88 for kerberos, excuse me,\nif I'm not saying that right.\n\n328\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.290\nI see something like port 389 and\nport 686,\n\n329\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:43.820\nI know that they're running some kind\nof Active Directory infrastructure.\n\n330\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.360\nSo we can kind of tell that we're in\nsome kinda Windows based network.\n\n331\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.190\nAnd I can tell you from an administrative\npoint, if you don't know it, that's okay.\n\n332\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.190\nThousands of hackers and attackers do.\n\n333\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.880\nSo it is definitely something\nyou have to get on board with.\n\n334\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you bring up a great point.\n\n335\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.450\nNot just for looking at traffic, but\nfor when you're doing port scans.\n\n336\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.680\nUnderstanding what those results mean,\nlooking at those port numbers that\n\n337\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.690\nare opening and listening can\ntell you a lot about the system.\n\n338\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.970\nThat's what we call\nfingerprinting the system and\n\n339\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.640\nfingerprinting an operating system,\nas Wes said.\n\n340\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.850\nYou see some ports that are common\nto Windows based services and\n\n341\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.320\nI can tell it's a Windows machine.\n\n342\n00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.340\nOr I have a good educated guess at least,\nthat that's a Windows machine, right?\n\n343\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.230\nVersus maybe it's a Linux machine\ncuz I see these ports open.\n\n344\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.810\nSo understanding those port\nnumbers is very, very important.\n\n345\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.320\nSo as I said,\nthe first 1,024 are your well-known ports.\n\n346\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.740\nThese have really been assigned\nto particular services.\n\n347\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.242\nFrom 1,024 on up to I've gotta remember,\nWes.\n\n348\n00:18:41.242 --> 00:18:43.327\n40-\n&gt;&gt; 49,151.\n\n349\n00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:44.464\n&gt;&gt; 151-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n350\n00:18:44.464 --> 00:18:46.312\n&gt;&gt; This is why we have this guy,\n\n351\n00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:47.472\nhe is the master.\n\n352\n00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:49.295\n49,151.\n\n353\n00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:53.706\nSo from 1024, 49,151,\nthese are my registered ports.\n\n354\n00:18:53.706 --> 00:18:57.330\nThese are ports that you and I, if we\nwrote an application could actually talk\n\n355\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.040\nto IANA about registering one of those\nports for our particular application.\n\n356\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.080\nSaying hey, this is our port,\nwe wanna use it.\n\n357\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.750\nIt's not like you get exclusive use to it.\n\n358\n00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.230\nAnybody can use the port.\n\n359\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.050\nBut you might have software that you\nwanna make sure uses a common port,\n\n360\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.650\ndo all the installs.\n\n361\n00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.320\nIt's easy to tell people hey,\nyou aren't running a software.\n\n362\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.510\nOpen up this particular port and\nthat port's kind of registered to you.\n\n363\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.620\nAgain, it's not like you get\nexclusive access to the port.\n\n364\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.043\nBut it's just what everybody else does say\nI'm writing software port 632 is already\n\n365\n00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.003\ntaken by this application,\nI'm gonna use a different port.\n\n366\n00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.499\nRight, that kind of thing.\n\n367\n00:19:33.499 --> 00:19:36.878\nAnd then from 49,192 then.\n\n368\n00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:38.503\n&gt;&gt; 49,152.\n\n369\n00:19:38.503 --> 00:19:44.378\n&gt;&gt; Or sorry, 152, all the way up to\n65,535, these are dynamic ports.\n\n370\n00:19:44.378 --> 00:19:48.360\nThese are the ones that can be opened\nup by applications as they need.\n\n371\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.760\nNow a lot of times when you have\nan application, it uses a specific port.\n\n372\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.780\nThat's all well and good but most of\nthese applications can multithread.\n\n373\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.070\nThey can do multiple\nthreads at the same time.\n\n374\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.080\nI can transfer that data that\nmuch faster if I could get some\n\n375\n00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.200\nadditional sockets created.\n\n376\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.810\nBut I only have one port.\n\n377\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.320\nSo what'll happen is the application'll\nopen up its main port.\n\n378\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.650\nBut then it can also open up multiple\nadditional sockets on those dynamic ports.\n\n379\n00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.920\nAnd those out there, like I said,\nthose dynamic ports, anybody can use.\n\n380\n00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.560\nThey're typically used temporarily.\n\n381\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.610\nThey're brought up used and\nthen take them back down.\n\n382\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.150\nJust throw an old one was good old,\nwhat was it,\n\n383\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.800\nWorld of Warcraft, I date myself here.\n\n384\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.250\nWhen you used to get the updates, yeah,\n\n385\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.420\nI told you what port to open up to be able\nto get your updates for this application.\n\n386\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.740\nBut I've also said, if you can allow\nit to use dynamic ports as well,\n\n387\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.980\nit can speed up the thoroughput.\n\n388\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.640\nAnd you just allow it to open up\nmultiple dynamic ports as it sees fit.\n\n389\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.580\nSo typically if we're doing port scans, if\nwe're seeing traffic in those high range\n\n390\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.090\nports, it's usually ports that\nare opened up for additional throughput.\n\n391\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.350\n&gt;&gt; And state packet inspection firewalls,\nright, I know SPI, boy that's\n\n392\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.030\nanother acronym we'll talk about it, but\nat some point I'm sure within this series.\n\n393\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.992\nThat's how they keep track\nof things like your TCP,\n\n394\n00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:11.785\nwe talked about the three way handshake,\nright?\n\n395\n00:21:11.785 --> 00:21:14.183\nLet me go ahead and\nact like a firewall here.\n\n396\n00:21:14.183 --> 00:21:18.256\nIf I know that coming back in to the\nnetwork, well, let me take a guess here,\n\n397\n00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:19.605\n65,000, right?\n\n398\n00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:24.517\nI've seen two of those send request\ncome in from the same destination\n\n399\n00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:29.258\nport than the firewall can say,\nwait a second now, wait a second,\n\n400\n00:21:29.258 --> 00:21:32.160\nI just got two send request here.\n\n401\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.420\nThis could be some kind of attack, so I'm\ngonna drop one of those based on the fact\n\n402\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.470\nthat I know where it's\ndestination is bound for.\n\n403\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n404\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.390\nAll right, so you know know your ports and\n\n405\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.640\nmore importantly know\nthose ranges as well.\n\n406\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.974\nAt least a good ballpark, 49151.\n\n407\n00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:52.445\nIt was that cut off from\nregister to dynamic.\n\n408\n00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:58.225\n1024 is cut off from the first one from\nthe well known into the registered,\n\n409\n00:21:58.225 --> 00:21:59.405\nso pay attention to those.\n\n410\n00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:01.975\nAgain, not only would it help\nyou secure your network, but\n\n411\n00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:04.935\nas well when you're parsing information,\nreading log files,\n\n412\n00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:07.555\nreading packet captures and\nthings like that.\n\n413\n00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:11.000\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of our IP service ports.\n\n414\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.720\nThe next thing we are going to do,\n\n415\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.140\nI wanna take a look at a couple\nof packet capture utilities.\n\n416\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.800\nAnd we're gonna show you how they work,\nhow we capture this data, but\n\n417\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.455\nmore importantly how we can\ntake a look at the data.\n\n418\n00:22:23.455 --> 00:22:26.545\nNow we're not gonna spend\nan entire week on this topic, so\n\n419\n00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:28.695\nit's gonna be a pretty high level.\n\n420\n00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:32.165\nBut we're gonna go back,\nit's very important that we understand\n\n421\n00:22:32.165 --> 00:22:35.875\nhow to look and\nfind information within these packets.\n\n422\n00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:42.320\n[COUGH] All right, so let's start\nwith something called Wire Shark.\n\n423\n00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.300\nSo I'm gonna fire up this application,\nfor those of you who have been around for\n\n424\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.260\na little while.\n\n425\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.530\nYou'll remember this one is ethereal or\nhowever you choose to pronounce that,\n\n426\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.800\nbecame Wire Shark,\none of my personal favorites.\n\n427\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.010\nBut almost all packet capture utilities,\nnetwork monitors, network sniffers,\n\n428\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.090\npacket sniffers, packet capture utilities.\n\n429\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.680\nThey're all referring to the same thing.\n\n430\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.810\nThey're talking about grabbing\nraw packets off of the wire, so\n\n431\n00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.940\nthat we can analyze them.\n\n432\n00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.580\nWhere we can see all the header\ninformation, the payload information,\n\n433\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.740\nthe checksum information,\nwe can see all that in there.\n\n434\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.270\nThey all work about the same,\nso once you find your favorite,\n\n435\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.770\ntypically you stick with that, but you\ncan usually jump from one to the other.\n\n436\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.070\nThe difference will be in\nhow you apply filters,\n\n437\n00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.740\nwe have to worry about what's\ncalled capture filters.\n\n438\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.820\nWe also look at what we call display\nfilters, the output, is it a text based\n\n439\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:39.630\nutility, is there a command line utility,\nis it a GUI, doesn't have a GUI available.\n\n440\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.570\nThose are really what we're\ngonna see as the differences.\n\n441\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.160\nNetwork monitor,\nI can't forget that one, right?\n\n442\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.200\nThat's one that Microsoft\nships with one of its OSs.\n\n443\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.088\nOr you can go out and\ndownload from Microsoft.\n\n444\n00:23:48.088 --> 00:23:53.208\nSo Wire Shark, again just happens\nto be one of my personal faves,\n\n445\n00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:56.200\nbut any one would really do the trick.\n\n446\n00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.036\nThis is a graphical one,\nbeen around for quite some time and\n\n447\n00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:04.733\nwhen we go to capture data We typically\nhave to tell it a couple of things.\n\n448\n00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:07.059\nWe have to tell it what network\nadapter I wanna listen on,\n\n449\n00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:09.830\nbecause I've got multiple\nnetwork adapters potentially.\n\n450\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.771\nIn this laptop,\nI've got a wired connection,\n\n451\n00:24:11.771 --> 00:24:14.876\nI've got a wireless connection,\nI've got a couple of virtual connections\n\n452\n00:24:14.876 --> 00:24:17.754\nfrom my virtual machines that\nare running in Hyper-V on this laptop.\n\n453\n00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:19.403\nI've got my loopback adapter.\n\n454\n00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:21.476\nProbably wouldn't be too\nexciting to listen to that one.\n\n455\n00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:26.480\nWhat else, I've got my Bluetooth, right?\n\n456\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.020\nAnd actually Wireshark, I was just\nnoticing this, Wes, when I installed\n\n457\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.610\nWireshark this last time, they've got\na new beta going right now, with a USB\n\n458\n00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.810\ncapture so that they can capture traffic\ngoing across USB, which is interesting.\n\n459\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.353\nThere's a lot of weird,\nI shouldn't say weird, but\n\n460\n00:24:41.353 --> 00:24:45.227\nthere are a lot of interesting\nthings being done with USB.\n\n461\n00:24:45.227 --> 00:24:48.855\nYou might have seen some of this\nout there in the news recently.\n\n462\n00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:52.320\nBeing able to hack computers\nby taking something,\n\n463\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.920\nbuilding something special and\nthen plugging it into the USB port and\n\n464\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.070\nbeing able to wake that machine up and\nactually grab data off of it.\n\n465\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.670\nInteresting, we'll just say.\n\n466\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.520\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting.\n\n467\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.930\nIn another episode, you explained PKI and\nwe talked about one of those\n\n468\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.950\nroot CAs that got attacked and exploited.\n\n469\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.272\nIt was one of the USB attacks,\nthey believe.\n\n470\n00:25:13.272 --> 00:25:14.724\nThat was a side note there, yeah.\n\n471\n00:25:14.724 --> 00:25:16.261\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, interesting.\n\n472\n00:25:16.261 --> 00:25:17.402\nAll right, so Wireshark,\n\n473\n00:25:17.402 --> 00:25:20.090\nwhat I'm gonna do, I'm just gonna\nfire both of these tools up.\n\n474\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.200\nAnd then we're gonna come back in another\nepisode and really take a look at what's\n\n475\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.860\ngoing on, how we're doing it,\nand analyzing the actual packets.\n\n476\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.560\nSo here with Wireshark,\nI'm just gonna grab my network adapter.\n\n477\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.920\nAnd you'll see that immediately,\nI start getting packets, all right?\n\n478\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.390\nThat's what each one of these little\nlines is, an actual packet in here.\n\n479\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.749\nAnd one of the things we have to think\nabout with packet capture utilities is,\n\n480\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.920\ncan we put our network\nadapter in promiscuous mode?\n\n481\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.430\nPromiscuous mode, let's talk about how\nnormally a network adapter behaves.\n\n482\n00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.240\nWe've talked about how our network\nadapters are assigned addresses, and\n\n483\n00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.800\nthat's how it sends and receives data.\n\n484\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.330\nAnd as data travels across the network,\nkeep in mind,\n\n485\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.420\nsome of the people don't\nthink about it sometimes.\n\n486\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.448\nEthernet is contention based, right?\n\n487\n00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:10.174\nAnd that means that if I spit\nsomething out onto the network,\n\n488\n00:26:10.174 --> 00:26:13.245\nevery node on my subnet\nbetween router to router,\n\n489\n00:26:13.245 --> 00:26:16.950\nso everything in between\nthere actually hears that.\n\n490\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.205\nIt's an electrical signal, right, it's not\nlike I'm hollering out hello, hey there.\n\n491\n00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:24.112\nIt's an electrical voltage\nspike that I am sending out.\n\n492\n00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:28.399\nAnd so that wire leaves my computer,\ngoes into the switch,\n\n493\n00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:33.045\ngoes to all the other ports in the switch,\nand then travels out.\n\n494\n00:26:33.045 --> 00:26:37.210\nSo when I turn that electricity on\nbasically it goes down that wire and out.\n\n495\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:42.790\nNow the switch can control whether or\nnot that voltage goes out those ports.\n\n496\n00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.620\nBut let's talk about if\nwe didn't have a switch.\n\n497\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.460\nLet's say we've got a hub.\n\n498\n00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.910\nRemember we talked about hubs and\nhow they just let all signal go through,\n\n499\n00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.490\nthey don't look at addresses or anything.\n\n500\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.490\nSo on a hubbed network,\nwhen my computer speaks,\n\n501\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.580\nevery node on that network hears it,\nright?\n\n502\n00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.500\nBut only those that have the destination\naddress on the packet that matches\n\n503\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.880\nare gonna actually receive the packet and\nread the packet.\n\n504\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.610\nThe other nodes what they're gonna see,\nthey see the packet as well.\n\n505\n00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.310\nBut they're saying that's not my\naddress on the destination and\n\n506\n00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.470\nthey silently drop it.\n\n507\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.090\nThey just ignore it basically, right?\n\n508\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.622\nAnd so if I was gonna capture traffic, if\nI wanna capture traffic, the only traffic\n\n509\n00:27:23.622 --> 00:27:28.221\nI'm gonna see that's actually getting into\nmy computer is if it has the destination\n\n510\n00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:31.680\naddress of my computer,\nwhich might not be all that exciting.\n\n511\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.939\nI need to see what everybody\nelse on my network is doing.\n\n512\n00:27:33.939 --> 00:27:36.129\nI wanna see if there's any\nbad guys on my network.\n\n513\n00:27:36.129 --> 00:27:40.332\nI wanna see what Wes put it in his email\nabout me cuz I know he doesn't encrypt\n\n514\n00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:41.078\nthat stuff.\n\n515\n00:27:41.078 --> 00:27:42.798\nHow do I get that traffic, right?\n\n516\n00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:46.000\nThat's where we need what's\ncalled promiscuous mode.\n\n517\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.430\nWe say, all right,\nI wanna listen to everything,\n\n518\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.400\neven if it's not destined for me.\n\n519\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.830\nIf the destination address does not match\nmy network address, grab it anyway, right?\n\n520\n00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.110\nThat's promiscuous mode.\n\n521\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.810\nAnd that's not the normal\nbehavior of network adaptors.\n\n522\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.160\nSo to run these packet capture utilities,\n\n523\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.470\nyour network adapter has to support\ngoing into promiscuous mode.\n\n524\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.198\nThis one, for example, Wireshark, will\nturn on promiscuous mode in your network\n\n525\n00:28:09.198 --> 00:28:12.620\nadapters for you,\nwhich most of them will do.\n\n526\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.110\nNow another thing we've gotta consider\nis the switch cuz what I'm saying,\n\n527\n00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.905\nwas if it were on a hub, I could see\nall the traffic on my subnet, right?\n\n528\n00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:24.400\nBecause that's what hubs do,\nthey just spit everything out every port.\n\n529\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.805\nBut we've talked about\nthe advantages of a switch.\n\n530\n00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.275\nI get port to port connectivity.\n\n531\n00:28:28.275 --> 00:28:31.675\nBasically, a point to point connection\nbetween me and that switch.\n\n532\n00:28:31.675 --> 00:28:35.455\nAnd the switch is keeping track of\nwhat MAC address is out that port.\n\n533\n00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:38.115\nIt looks at the incoming traffic\nfrom that port, and says, well,\n\n534\n00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:41.895\nif the source address is this, and\nit's coming in from that port,\n\n535\n00:28:41.895 --> 00:28:44.065\nthat MAC address must\nreside out that port.\n\n536\n00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:49.470\nSo when traffic is coming into the switch,\nit looks at that destination MAC address,\n\n537\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.950\nlooks at its content\naddressable memory table.\n\n538\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.640\nCAM table, and\nit says that's going to Mike's laptop.\n\n539\n00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.470\nHe's out port 20, and allow it to go out\nport 20, but not out port 19 or 18 or\n\n540\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.520\n17, right.\n\n541\n00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.520\nIt keeps the traffic down\nwhich is a great thing.\n\n542\n00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.364\nBut what it also means is even if I put\nmy network adapter in promiscuous mode,\n\n543\n00:29:10.364 --> 00:29:13.930\nI'm still not gonna see any traffic\nexcept the stuff that was bound to me in\n\n544\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:14.990\nthe first place.\n\n545\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.242\nWhich is not what I'm trying to find.\n\n546\n00:29:17.242 --> 00:29:21.988\nSo switched ethernets, which is the most\ncommon form of ethernet in your business\n\n547\n00:29:21.988 --> 00:29:27.036\nenvironment today, are gonna really hamper\nyour packet capture abilities, right?\n\n548\n00:29:27.036 --> 00:29:30.090\nWe get on wireless,\nthat's a different story.\n\n549\n00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.960\nBecause that's unbound media and\nwe can see a lot.\n\n550\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.150\nBut if in a wired network on a switch,\n\n551\n00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.990\nyou're not gonna see too\nmuch exciting stuff.\n\n552\n00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.260\nAnd yes, you're the one that you're trying\nto capture that data, if you're trying to\n\n553\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.180\ncapture your own data, which kinda\nseem silly because it's your data.\n\n554\n00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.570\nYou don't really need to capture it.\n\n555\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.577\nI don't know.\nAnyway, my point is on switched ethernet,\n\n556\n00:29:50.577 --> 00:29:52.571\nyou do have to take additional steps.\n\n557\n00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:57.058\nAnd that means a lot of times a switch can\nbe configured to do what they call port\n\n558\n00:29:57.058 --> 00:30:01.824\nmirroring, or when it dumps all traffic\nout of a particular port specifically for\n\n559\n00:30:01.824 --> 00:30:04.030\nthe purpose of monitoring.\n\n560\n00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.623\nYou might have to do something like\nthat in order to see that traffic.\n\n561\n00:30:07.623 --> 00:30:08.775\nI know for a while,\n\n562\n00:30:08.775 --> 00:30:12.820\nfor example, one of the companies\nI worked for, we did just that.\n\n563\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.970\nWe had one of the ports acting as\na monitoring port on the switch and\n\n564\n00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.360\nall traffic was mirrored.\n\n565\n00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.188\nThe traffic would go to its normal port,\nand when I'm saying port,\n\n566\n00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:27.130\nit's in switch port,\nnot port as in TCP/IP port, right?\n\n567\n00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.520\nThe traffic was destined for\nMike's computer.\n\n568\n00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.050\nThen the switch would allow it to go\nout the port that Mike's computer was\n\n569\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:32.940\nhooked up to.\n\n570\n00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.970\nBut it would duplicate it and\nalso send it to that mirroring port.\n\n571\n00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.840\nAll right, so\nthat the boss could capture that data and\n\n572\n00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.934\nsee what webpages I was going\nto in the middle of the day.\n\n573\n00:30:41.934 --> 00:30:43.145\nYeah, not good.\nAlmost got fired over that, no,\n\n574\n00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:43.688\nI'm kidding.\n\n575\n00:30:43.688 --> 00:30:48.603\nBut that's the idea, is in switched\nyou're gonna have to figure out a way\n\n576\n00:30:48.603 --> 00:30:51.550\nto be able to get in-between that traffic.\n\n577\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.350\nAnother solution would be to take a hub,\nand get in between your router and\n\n578\n00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.680\nthe switch, and put a hub in there, right.\n\n579\n00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.780\nAnd then plug your monitoring computer\nInto that hub, cuz you're basically seeing\n\n580\n00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.240\nall the data before it gets to the switch\nor after it leaves the switch.\n\n581\n00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.770\nSo you're just getting to a point in\nthe network where you can see all that\n\n582\n00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.960\ntraffic, right?\n\n583\n00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.220\nSo something you've gotta think about\nwhen you're running your active captures,\n\n584\n00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.530\nwhatever you're trying to do,\n\n585\n00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.270\nyou gotta get to where you\ncan see the actual traffic.\n\n586\n00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.490\nSo you've gotta understand how hubs work,\nhow switches work, how routers work.\n\n587\n00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.100\nCuz that's gonna determine what\ntraffic you get to see or not.\n\n588\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that's a lot of great\ninformation, but I know one thing.\n\n589\n00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:33.040\nYou started running the packet capture\nutility, but you still haven't showed us.\n\n590\n00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.676\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n591\n00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:35.221\n&gt;&gt; I have to tell you we're probably\n\n592\n00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:36.827\ngonna have to go into a part three.\n\n593\n00:31:36.827 --> 00:31:39.708\nAnd we're gonna have to leave everybody\njust waiting on the edge of their seat if\n\n594\n00:31:39.708 --> 00:31:41.353\nthey've never see what\na packet looks like.\n\n595\n00:31:41.353 --> 00:31:43.419\nSo what do you say we go ahead and\nwe'll stop it here.\n\n596\n00:31:43.419 --> 00:31:47.868\nWe'll go into a part three maybe, and\nthen come back and you can kind of show us\n\n597\n00:31:47.868 --> 00:31:51.580\nthe DNA, if you will,\nof a packet that you've been capturing.\n\n598\n00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.820\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n599\n00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthat's a perfect place to wrap this up.\n\n600\n00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.180\nMike, as always,\nwe appreciate you being here.\n\n601\n00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.050\nWe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n602\n00:31:59.050 -->

00:00:24.190\nAnd who better than to help us\nwith this topic, other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.280\nMike Rodrick himself, thank you for\njoining us today Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.240\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.932\nI'm sure there's a few other\npeople that might be better.\n\n12\n00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:31.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.760\n&gt;&gt; That I'd like to learn from,\n\n14\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.850\nno, I'm kidding.\n\n15\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.923\nExcited to be here, yeah, continuing\non with our GAIC Security Essentials.\n\n16\n00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:42.270\nAnd, as Cherokee said, we're gonna be\ntalking about network security in general.\n\n17\n00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.834\nReally looking at a couple of\ndifferent things that when we think\n\n18\n00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.810\nabout network security,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n19\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.370\nAnd usually we're talking about the\ndifferent types of appliances that we can\n\n20\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.480\nput in place to help keep our networks\nsecure and just other general methods that\n\n21\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.380\nwe can do to secure our\nnetwork communications, right?\n\n22\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.020\nBecause when we think about it,\nall of our data, our usernames and\n\n23\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.025\npasswords, all of that is traveling\nback and forth across our network.\n\n24\n00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.830\nAnd we've gotta keep that\nsafe from the bad guy,\n\n25\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.730\nboth external and internal, one of those\nthings we don't wanna forget about.\n\n26\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.010\nSo, yeah, in this module, again, just\nlooking at some of the basic devices we\n\n27\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.890\ncan use to help keep our network secure.\n\n28\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.234\nAnd that's gotta start with, any\nconversation that deals with securing our\n\n29\n00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.025\nnetworks, almost always has to\nstart with firewalls, right?\n\n30\n00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:30.630\nCuz those are one of the most basic\nthings we can put in place to\n\n31\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.805\nhelp keep our network safe.\n\n32\n00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.258\nAnd they've been around for\na long time, but they act really,\n\n33\n00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:40.980\nour first line of defense in most cases,\nas far as keeping our networks secure.\n\n34\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you think about it logically,\nthat is just the actual design and\n\n35\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.470\nthe layouts.\n\n36\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.170\nThat's what people come\nin contact with first,\n\n37\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.850\nor users trying to\nconnect to your network.\n\n38\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\nwe call it our perimeter defense, and\n\n39\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.410\nthat's not to say that we won't use\nfirewalls in other places, right?\n\n40\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.340\nBut one of the most common placements for,\nand\n\n41\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.280\nif you're going to have one firewall for\nyour network,\n\n42\n00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.670\nthat's where it's most likely gonna go,\nis on the border of your network.\n\n43\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.040\nBut we talk about putting firewalls\nin place between trusted and\n\n44\n00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.980\nuntrusted networks, which is usually our\ncorporate network and the Internet, right,\n\n45\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.090\nthe outside world, everybody else.\n\n46\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.440\nBut that also, not to take away from using\nthem internally where I might have more or\n\n47\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.930\nless trusted portions of my network,\nI can definitely put a firewall there.\n\n48\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.652\nSo, we're really talking about,\nfirewalls usually separate trust levels.\n\n49\n00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:34.900\nAll right, when we're talking\nabout networks which segregate out\n\n50\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.218\nbased on our trust or\nour security requirements.\n\n51\n00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:43.480\nSo you might have a firewall in\nbetween your client network and\n\n52\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.210\nsome of your more sensitive servers,\n\n53\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.070\nwhich controls that traffic that's allowed\nto reach in there and talk to those guys.\n\n54\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.730\nAnd maybe I've got servers that users\ndon't directly talk to but they've got\n\n55\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.310\nan application that is allowed to retrieve\ndata from these servers back there.\n\n56\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.760\nSo I can set up a firewall what only\nallows traffic from the application and\n\n57\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.950\nnot from a user just\nbrowsing to say a share or\n\n58\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860\nsomething like that on those machines.\n\n59\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.600\nSo don't get to focused and say\nfirewalls only go on the perimeter, but\n\n60\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.510\nthat is the most common placement for\nthem.\n\n61\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.300\nWe also have network based firewalls and\nhost based firewalls all right.\n\n62\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.770\nMost of our operating systems\nnow come with firewalls that we\n\n63\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.250\ncan run on an individual machine.\n\n64\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.430\nAnd the concept is the same but\n\n65\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.410\na network based firewall is kind\nof protecting the entire network.\n\n66\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.490\nWhereas a host based firewall would\nonly be protecting that individual host.\n\n67\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.960\nHonestly, though, we see the only issue\nyou run into, right, like running host\n\n68\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.960\nbased firewalls, is let's say I've gotta\nmake an exception for an application.\n\n69\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.450\nNow I've gotta do it on\nthat host based firewall or\n\n70\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.000\nmultiple host based firewalls and\non my network based firewall.\n\n71\n00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.879\nSo when you run them on a host, it's\nusually one that needs an extra layer of\n\n72\n00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.930\nprotection above and beyond maybe what\nthat network firewall is giving you.\n\n73\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.390\nAll right, so\nfirewalls what the heck is a firewall?\n\n74\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.876\nIt's not a wall of fire\nalthough that would be cool and\n\n75\n00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:06.876\nit would stop most packets from coming in.\n\n76\n00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:11.009\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of confusing Mike because if\nyour boss were to give you a budget and\n\n77\n00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.981\nsay okay I need you to design\na portion of our network and\n\n78\n00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.493\nsaid I want you to pick up some\nfirewalls and just left it at that.\n\n79\n00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:20.385\nIt's kind of like going to a car lot and\npicking out a car, there's so many\n\n80\n00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.730\ndifferent features and you really need\nto know what you're looking for, right.\n\n81\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.440\n&gt;&gt; It really is, yes, and when we talk\nabout firewalls, we can talk about first\n\n82\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.210\ngeneration, second generation,\nthird generation, next generation.\n\n83\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.270\nAnd each one is really just adding\ncapabilities to what that firewall can do.\n\n84\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.900\nSo let's talk about,\nas far as the objectives go for this exam,\n\n85\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.300\nthey wanna talk about the different types\nof firewalls that we might run into.\n\n86\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.070\nAnd so we should talk about packet\nfilters, circuit level filters or\n\n87\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.140\ncircuit level gateways,\nstateful inspection, application gateways,\n\n88\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.240\ndeck generation firewalls, all these\nwould be different types of firewalls.\n\n89\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.250\nAnd packet filtering, right,\nand we'll come back and\n\n90\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.790\nwe'll talk about a couple of these\nconcepts like stateful versus packet\n\n91\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.040\nfiltering and in-depth of what\nthey are in just a minute.\n\n92\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.030\nBut let's talk about firewalls in general.\n\n93\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.320\nWhen we say we've got\na packet level firewall,\n\n94\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.050\nthis is what we would call\na first gen firewall.\n\n95\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.480\nThis is what firewalls did in the very\nbeginning, that was all they did.\n\n96\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.430\nAnd it was a lot, don't get me wrong, it\nwas a very important part of our security.\n\n97\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.630\nBut basic firewalls filter\ntraffic based on rules, right.\n\n98\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.210\nAs those packets are coming\nin in that firewall,\n\n99\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.730\nthat firewall is the entry\nway into your network.\n\n100\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.030\nAnd as each one of those packets comes in,\nthey're inspected.\n\n101\n00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.990\nThey're looked at by the firewall, by the\nsoftware that's running on that firewall.\n\n102\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.040\nAnd based on a set of rules that\nwe've configured on that firewall,\n\n103\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.760\nthey're gonna decide whether to allow or\ndrop, allow those packets to go through or\n\n104\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.790\ndrop those packets and\nnot allow them to come through.\n\n105\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.230\nAnd with a first gen firewall or\nwhat we call a packet filtering firewall,\n\n106\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.800\nall we really did was look at the source\nand destination IP address and\n\n107\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.740\nthe port numbers as well.\n\n108\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.810\nThere's a little bit more, and\nwe'll talk about that in a minute but\n\n109\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.772\nthat was really all they were looking at,\nit was very basic.\n\n110\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.380\nWho's this coming from,\nwho's it going to, type of information.\n\n111\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.230\nWhich was good, it still helped, right?\n\n112\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.870\nThis allowed me to do things like, there's\na known bad network out there that's been,\n\n113\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.940\nlet's say we've been getting scanned,\nand we had some attacks on our network,\n\n114\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.350\nand they've come from this\none IP address range.\n\n115\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.600\nWe can then make a rule on our firewall\nthat says look drop all packets\n\n116\n00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.070\nfrom this particular IP address or\nthis particular IP range.\n\n117\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.120\nAnd those packet filtering\nfirewalls could do that.\n\n118\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.780\nThey look at the packet they read\nthe TCP header they see the source of\n\n119\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.990\nIP address and\nthey say no we're dropping that.\n\n120\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.970\nOr looking at private IP addresses\ncoming from my outside of my network,\n\n121\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.180\nwhere private IP address\nshouldn't be coming from.\n\n122\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.162\nInternal, non routable, right?\n\n123\n00:06:55.162 --> 00:06:58.820\nWe've talked,\nwe know about those classes within our IP\n\n124\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.740\naddress ranges that are private,\nnon routable addresses.\n\n125\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.970\nWhat the bad guys will do is\nthat they will try to spoof\n\n126\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.530\nan address to get past\nyour firewall rules.\n\n127\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.640\nSo, from an outside facing\nport on your firewall,\n\n128\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.150\nin comes a packet that has a source IP\naddress of 192.168, something, something.\n\n129\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.890\nWe know that shouldn't be happening,\nright?\n\n130\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.070\nThat's an example of an attack\nthat somebody's trying to do.\n\n131\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.166\nAnd a packet filter could catch that,\ncould stop that from happening.\n\n132\n00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:28.054\nAll right,\nyou've got circuit level gateways and\n\n133\n00:07:28.054 --> 00:07:33.570\ncircuit level gateways really\nmonitor the TCP handshake process.\n\n134\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.640\nThey're going to watch the syn.\n\n135\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.040\nWe should know at this point\nabout the TCP three-way handshake\n\n136\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.290\nthat occurs when you\nestablish a TCP connection.\n\n137\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.480\nYou've got your syn packet that goes out\nwhen you request to make the connection.\n\n138\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.274\nThe other end is supposed to respond with\na syn-ack with acknowledgement of your\n\n139\n00:07:50.274 --> 00:07:51.627\nsynchronization request.\n\n140\n00:07:51.627 --> 00:07:54.777\nAnd the synchronization requests\non their own, of their own,\n\n141\n00:07:54.777 --> 00:07:57.104\nand then a final\nacknowledgement going back.\n\n142\n00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:59.824\nAcknowledging their\nsynchronisation request and\n\n143\n00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:03.790\nthose three packets are known\nas the TCP three way handshake.\n\n144\n00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.750\nAnd a circuit level\ngateway can monitor and\n\n145\n00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.410\nsee that established connection and\nthen keep track of that.\n\n146\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.450\nAnd I say, okay this is a connection that\nhas been established between host and\n\n147\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.270\nhost are two different nodes,\nand now all subsequent traffic,\n\n148\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.250\nI can allow through without having\nto do any further inspection,\n\n149\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.200\nit's an established TCP connection.\n\n150\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.790\nThen you've got stateful inspections.\n\n151\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.570\nAnd this really where we came into\nthe second generation, all right.\n\n152\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.630\nThis was the next evolution in our\nfirewalls that started out as simply\n\n153\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.110\npacket filters, and\nnow we're gonna give them the ability to\n\n154\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.440\nlook inside the packet, take a look\nat the content of the packet itself.\n\n155\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.940\nThey can also monitor the TCP handshake or\nthe TCP connection,\n\n156\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.680\nwhich actually, in the end reduces a\nlittle bit of overhead on those firewalls,\n\n157\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.560\nbecause what they do is they look for\nthe SIM packets.\n\n158\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.950\nThe packet where the acknowledgement\npacket is not raised or\n\n159\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.310\nset to zero,\nthey know that's the initial packet.\n\n160\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.920\nThey can watch that, see that connection\nestablished, and now any other\n\n161\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.590\npackets that come through that are part of\nthat conversation can be allowed because\n\n162\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.580\nthey already know it's part of\nan established successful connection.\n\n163\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.681\n&gt;&gt; By looking at that information,\n\n164\n00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.966\nwould they be able to prevent any\nkind of hijacking attack session?\n\n165\n00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:22.796\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a little bit, they can.\n\n166\n00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.927\nWhen we talk about, well,\n\n167\n00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:29.569\nit really depends on how\nthe attack is being done, I guess?\n\n168\n00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.122\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n169\n00:09:30.122 --> 00:09:35.888\n&gt;&gt; But it can help make sure that all\nthose packets belong to that conversation,\n\n170\n00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:38.026\nas far as the stateful does.\n\n171\n00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:39.112\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n172\n00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.390\n&gt;&gt; And they can again look at the content\ninside those packets as well.\n\n173\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.630\nThen you have application gateways.\n\n174\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.265\nAnd application gateways are what we would\n\n175\n00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:50.680\nconsider that third\ngeneration of firewalls.\n\n176\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.470\nThese were application specific,\nthey went higher up on that OSI model and\n\n177\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.500\ncould look at data at those higher levels,\nwhich gave me the ability to inspect\n\n178\n00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.870\ndata that was coming in to that\nweb application, for example.\n\n179\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.250\nBecause I know there's certain rules\nI wanna allow or not allow allow, so\n\n180\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.260\nit goes a little bit above and\n\n181\n00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.790\nbeyond just general packet inspection,\nnow we're looking at those higher levels.\n\n182\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.870\nAnd then you get your next generation\nfirewalls, or your NGFWs, right?\n\n183\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.620\nWhich [COUGH] really start\ncombining a lot of technologies.\n\n184\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.750\nWe get, what's the word I'm looking for,\n\n185\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:33.720\nthe gosh the safe inspection wow brain\ncramp there we were just talking about it.\n\n186\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.340\nWe get the staple inspection capabilities\nbut we also start adding in application\n\n187\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.725\nfirewall capabilities, we also add in\na deeper packet inspection, where they\n\n188\n00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:48.535\ncan go further inside, and take a closer\nlook at what's going on in those packets.\n\n189\n00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:50.415\nAs well as possibly\nintrusion detection and\n\n190\n00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:54.620\nintrusion prevention systems,\nkinda all rolled up into one.\n\n191\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.294\nAnd this is what you're seeing now,\n\n192\n00:10:56.294 --> 00:11:00.399\nthese next-generation firewalls which can\nsimplify things, because you start rolling\n\n193\n00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:03.220\nthings into what now I've only\ngot that one device to deploy.\n\n194\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds like we're building\nupon as we're travelling up the OSI,\n\n195\n00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:09.580\nnot really having to sacrifice anything\nwith these higher-level devices.\n\n196\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n197\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.590\nThe only downside to using, anytime we\nstart talking about combining roles into\n\n198\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.650\na single device now all of a sudden\nit becomes a point of failure for\n\n199\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.350\nmore than one service.\n\n200\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.220\nSo if it happens to go down, not only\ndo we lose our, if we had a packet\n\n201\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.825\nfilter firewall and then a web application\nfirewall running somewhere else, and\n\n202\n00:11:28.825 --> 00:11:30.970\nif one failed the other one is still up.\n\n203\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.060\nOr if I intrusion detection prevention\nsystem was a separate device,\n\n204\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.990\nthen if the firewall went down, intrusion\nprevention detection are still running.\n\n205\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.840\nNow that we've combined them all into one,\n\n206\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.070\nit is starting to become\na single point of failure.\n\n207\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.740\nBut usually the benefits outweigh\nthe risks associated, and\n\n208\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.550\nwe can do things to provide fault\ntolerance for that as well.\n\n209\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.330\nSo when it comes to firewalls, and\nagain that's just a quick look at some of\n\n210\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.690\nthe different types of firewalls\nthat we should be familiar with.\n\n211\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.460\nYou need to decide what it\nis that you're going to do.\n\n212\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.747\nAs Cherokee mentioned earlier on,\nlet's say the boss comes to you and\n\n213\n00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:10.444\nsays we need a firewall,\ngo out and get one.\n\n214\n00:12:10.444 --> 00:12:12.225\nWow, okay the choices\nare I've got this little,\n\n215\n00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:13.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Home firewall that I can go get\n\n217\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.350\nfor 40 bucks.\n\n218\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.870\nI've got this-\n&gt;&gt; Enterprise level, massive device.\n\n219\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This next\n\n220\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.640\ngeneration firewall that's got\nall the bells and whistles,\n\n221\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.700\nand great dashboards, and\nblinky lights, and everything.\n\n222\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.454\nBut it's gonna cost me\nthousands of dollars, and\n\n223\n00:12:30.454 --> 00:12:33.310\nan additional per-user license,\nor something crazy like that.\n\n224\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.140\nSo there's a lot to think about-\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately,\n\n225\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.273\nwe usually have a budget, right?\n\n226\n00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:39.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hopefully we've got a budget.\n\n227\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.600\nAnd what you have to think about is,\n\n228\n00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.050\nwhat is it that I'm really\ntrying to do with this?\n\n229\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.070\nAnd that's what you're gonna look at.\n\n230\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.560\nIf all I need is to do some stateful\npacket inspection, and I've\n\n231\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.127\nalready got other solutions for intrusion\ndetection protection and things like that.\n\n232\n00:12:53.127 --> 00:12:54.465\nThen I maybe you don't have to go out and\n\n233\n00:12:54.465 --> 00:12:57.135\nbuy that high end next\ngeneration firewall.\n\n234\n00:12:57.135 --> 00:13:00.685\nSo, you're gonna look at what it is you're\ntrying to accomplish with that firewall.\n\n235\n00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:03.850\nYou're not gonna get a next generation\nfirewall to protect the web application,\n\n236\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.055\nyou'd want a web application firewall,\nthat's what they're designed to do.\n\n237\n00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:11.790\nSo, try to figure out what it is you're\ntrying to do, and then go from there.\n\n238\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.220\nPros to firewalls.\n\n239\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.400\nI didn't even list anything on my notes.\n\n240\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.660\nI don't even know what to say.\n\n241\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.340\nThere's too many, right.\n\n242\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.540\nWithout a firewall, people have free\nreign into your internal network, right.\n\n243\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.090\nIt is that wall that we put up to prevent\nthe outside from being able to come\n\n244\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.410\ninto my network, any port they want,\nany IP address they want, right.\n\n245\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.010\nSo it is our first line in defense.\n\n246\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.300\nNow cons, I can think of a few with cons.\n\n247\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.730\nCons, you wanna think about not so much\nif there's a con of running a firewall.\n\n248\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.780\nBut there are some things that they can\n\n249\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.240\ngive us a false sense of\nsecurity if we're not careful.\n\n250\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.110\nThey don't protect\nagainst internal attacks.\n\n251\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.670\nIf you're running a firewall\nat the edge of your network.\n\n252\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.300\nIf I'm already inside and I'm an employee\nthat's disgruntled I go to attack our file\n\n253\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.120\nserver or our database server, I'm never\ngoing through the firewall, I'm inside.\n\n254\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.060\nSo that firewall's not gonna do\nanything to stop that type of attack.\n\n255\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.460\nDoesn't protect against authorized\nmalicious users, all right.\n\n256\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.120\nIf I'm allowed to be at home and work from\nhome and come through that firewall and\n\n257\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.770\nconnect to resources,\nwell just because I'm angry and\n\n258\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.470\nI wanna launch an attack\nthe firewall's not gonna ask me,\n\n259\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.620\nhey what's your state of\nmind before you connect.\n\n260\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.210\n&gt;&gt; How do you feel today?\n\n261\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.000\n&gt;&gt; Are you in a bad mood?\n\n262\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.130\nAre you gonna be doing an attack,\nor are you doing legitimate work?\n\n263\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.670\nIf I'm authorized, I'm authorized,\nand it's gonna allow me through.\n\n264\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.910\nWhat I do once I get through,\nthat's on the end user so\n\n265\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.400\nthe firewall can't do anything about that.\n\n266\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.160\nAnd then you've got, they don't\nprotect from all external exploits.\n\n267\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.570\nAnd you think, wait Mike, you just said we\nput this on the edge of our network and\n\n268\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.380\nit keeps us safe from\nthe outside out there.\n\n269\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.848\nWe are good to go with that firewall.\n\n270\n00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:55.960\nWell, sort of, we can use it to close\nthe ports that we're not using or\n\n271\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.230\nthat we don't need open.\n\n272\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.670\nWe can use it to inspect packets as\nthey come through on the ports that we\n\n273\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:06.070\nare allowing, but because a lot\nof service run on similar ports.\n\n274\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.210\nAnd one of the problems is that that port\nhas to be open and so now the bad guy can\n\n275\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.340\ntry to take advantage of that service,\nfind a flaw in a service that's got that\n\n276\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.640\nport open on my firewall and\nit can't do anything about that, right?\n\n277\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.410\nIf we close port 80, we close it for\n\n278\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.040\neverything, not just Farmville that my\nusers wanna play, that's another issue.\n\n279\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.360\nHow do I block Farmville but\n\n280\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.690\nstill allow port 80 because I've got\na web server that has to be reached?\n\n281\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.630\n&gt;&gt; Well that's kind of the concept\nwith having the additional features\n\n282\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.530\nhaving all of these extra blinky lights\nand bells and whistles as you put it.\n\n283\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.609\nIt might become a little bit\nmore difficult to configure.\n\n284\n00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:45.428\nSo that's another thing we want to think\nabout is just any malconfigurations or\n\n285\n00:15:45.428 --> 00:15:47.710\nmisconfigurations on that device as well.\n\n286\n00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.808\n&gt;&gt; Yes miscongfigurations\nare the death of firewalls.\n\n287\n00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:50.329\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n288\n00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:51.399\n&gt;&gt; It does all the time.\n\n289\n00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.719\nI mean it's very easy to\nmisconfigure your rules or\n\n290\n00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:59.271\nleave them in default configuration or\nif you're new to firewalls and\n\n291\n00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:03.740\nyou start making rules,\nyou look at them in the right order.\n\n292\n00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.190\nThose firewalls, the way they process\nthe rules is from top to bottom.\n\n293\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.090\nAnd as soon as they find a rule that\nmatches they don't go any further,\n\n294\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.670\nthis rule matches the current packet and\nso\n\n295\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.630\nI'm gonna use this rule to decide\nwhether to allow or drop that packet.\n\n296\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.010\nSo if I give my rules out of order,\nI can end up, let's say,\n\n297\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.040\nwe've got,\nour bottom rule should be denial.\n\n298\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.850\nIf it's made it to every other rule and\nnone of them matches the current packet,\n\n299\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.000\nthen the very last rule should\nreally be drop everything, but\n\n300\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.440\nwhat if I get that drop\neverything up to the front?\n\n301\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.111\nWell now nothing's ever gonna get through\nmy firewall because the first rule it\n\n302\n00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:40.882\ncomes to says hey, drop everything.\n\n303\n00:16:40.882 --> 00:16:44.281\nIt's not gonna look at that and go, this\none matches but maybe I'll go a little\n\n304\n00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:47.335\nfurther to see if there's anything\nthat matches better, all right?\n\n305\n00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:51.012\nOr the reverse, you end up getting\none of your general rules that's\n\n306\n00:16:51.012 --> 00:16:53.720\npretty open you put that\nup towards the front, and\n\n307\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.770\nnow all of a sudden everything's\nmaking it through your firewall.\n\n308\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.460\nBecause it's never reaching\nthe rest of your rules.\n\n309\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.660\nSo misconfiguration, Cherokee, is a big,\nbig problem with our firewalls.\n\n310\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.040\nAll right, we talked about\nwhere to place them, already,\n\n311\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.200\nbetween your trusted and\nun-trusted networks.\n\n312\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.760\nTypically that means my corporate\nnetwork and the internet.\n\n313\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.724\nBut as I said, we use them internally as\nwell to segregate out certain portions of\n\n314\n00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:20.251\nmy network that have more\nsensitive information.\n\n315\n00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:22.831\nOr anywhere we need to control access to,\nor\n\n316\n00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:27.215\nwhat type of traffic is allowed to\ngo into that portion of the network.\n\n317\n00:17:27.215 --> 00:17:30.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like with a database or any kind\nof sensitive financial information that\n\n318\n00:17:30.305 --> 00:17:32.315\nnot all employees should have access to.\n\n319\n00:17:32.315 --> 00:17:33.325\nWhatever your network needs.\n\n320\n00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:34.645\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n321\n00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:37.400\nAll right, now, let's talk a little\nbit more about packet filtering.\n\n322\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.767\nI said I'd go back and\ntake a little deeper discussion on that.\n\n323\n00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:43.542\nWhen we talk about packet filtering,\n\n324\n00:17:43.542 --> 00:17:47.530\nwe're talking about working with protocols\nis one thing they can filter on.\n\n325\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.590\nSo we're up there at the network layer or\nIP layer, or I'm sorry,\n\n326\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.130\nthe IP header in the network layer.\n\n327\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.060\nI can say, look, there shouldn't be any\nFTP traffic coming through this firewall.\n\n328\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.330\nSo we can look at the protocols that\nare being used in those packets.\n\n329\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.470\nWe can look at the source address,\nwe can look at the destination address.\n\n330\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.270\nSo, up there again in that height IP\nlayer, that's on the network, I'm sorry,\n\n331\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.430\nthe IP header, sorry.\n\n332\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.070\nThe IP header is where the source and\n\n333\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:19.380\ndestination, IP address is gonna be\nfound that's in network layer OSI model.\n\n334\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.200\nWe can also look at\nthe port number on those.\n\n335\n00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.010\nAnyway, are port and\nprotocol kinda the same thing?\n\n336\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.120\nYes and no.\n\n337\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.330\nI mean we understand that there\nare certain port numbers assigned\n\n338\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.050\nto protocols, but that doesn't mean\nwe can't change that up, right?\n\n339\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.549\nSo not always at web traffic\ndoesn't always go across port 80.\n\n340\n00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:42.602\nI'll use port 8080 if I've got more than\none website that I am listening to I might\n\n341\n00:18:42.602 --> 00:18:45.770\nuse multiple and I have to have\nadditional port numbers assigned.\n\n342\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.330\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention is it TCP versus UDP or\nboth?\n\n343\n00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n344\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.320\nIs it secure or 443?\n\n345\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.810\nSource and destination port then, again\non TCP, UDP headers, connection status.\n\n346\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.265\nWe can look at the TCP header and\nthe transport layer.\n\n347\n00:19:04.265 --> 00:19:06.335\nAnd see what our connection status is.\n\n348\n00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:09.000\nWe can look at that three-way handshake,\nsee if it's been acknowledged and\n\n349\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.580\nsynchronized.\n\n350\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.700\nPacket filtering, keep in mind though,\n\n351\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.820\npacket filtering does not\ndo any stateful inspection.\n\n352\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.295\nWe're not looking at a payload.\n\n353\n00:19:17.295 --> 00:19:20.175\nWe're only looking with packet filtering,\n\n354\n00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:24.265\nwe're only talking about looking at the IP\nheader and the TCP and UDP headers.\n\n355\n00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:26.355\nThat's as far as it's allowed to go.\n\n356\n00:19:26.355 --> 00:19:27.765\nIt just doesn't know anymore, right?\n\n357\n00:19:27.765 --> 00:19:31.295\nBecause, remember, this is one of\nour first generation firewalls and\n\n358\n00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.555\nthat was about all they could do.\n\n359\n00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:36.215\nDidn't have the processing power\nto do much more than that anyway.\n\n360\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.740\nStateful, and we mentioned that was\nour second generation firewalls.\n\n361\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.040\nNow, we are talking about looking\ninto the payload area, and we can\n\n362\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.770\nlook at all the different levels of the\nOSI model, really this allows me to again,\n\n363\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.399\nlook for known code for attacks.\n\n364\n00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.480\nAnything malicious that might\nbe hiding in those payloads.\n\n365\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.810\nAgain, with stateful,\nit does monitor the first packet and\n\n366\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.230\nthe connection, looking for\nthe syn flag without the ack flag.\n\n367\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.470\nWhen the ack flag,\nthe acknowledgement flag is set to zero\n\n368\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.340\nthat denotes the beginning\nof a conversation.\n\n369\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.010\nAnd then all subsequent packets to and\n\n370\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.620\nfrom same address are gonna be allowed,\nbecause it's keeping track of that state.\n\n371\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.550\nIt's gonna say okay, Mike and\nCherokee have an established conversation.\n\n372\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.489\nAnd I don't have to inspect the source and\ndestination information,\n\n373\n00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:33.505\nas long as it matches that\nfirst one we're good to go.\n\n374\n00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:37.071\nCan still look inside the packets to make\nsure we're not doing anything bad but\n\n375\n00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.787\nit allows those to passes part\nof that initial connection.\n\n376\n00:20:39.787 --> 00:20:44.251\nThis is one of the reasons why the bad\nguys always want you to click on\n\n377\n00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:46.177\nsomething from the inside.\n\n378\n00:20:46.177 --> 00:20:47.521\n&gt;&gt; To initiate that communication?\n\n379\n00:20:47.521 --> 00:20:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because I can't get out through\nyour firewall into your network.\n\n380\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.060\nBut if you initiate\nthe connection from the inside and\n\n381\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.960\nyour firewall sees that packet going out.\n\n382\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.190\nThere's that first packet that goes out,\nthe send request without\n\n383\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.950\nan acknowledgment, zero for\nthe acknowledgment flag.\n\n384\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.800\nTraffic that's coming back is\npart of that conversation.\n\n385\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.720\nAnd now it's gonna be allowed, right.\n\n386\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.660\nSo the bad guy just needs you to reach\nout and say hello from the inside.\n\n387\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.710\nSo that the firewall will then say that's\npart of an established connection,\n\n388\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.180\nwe'll go ahead and\nlet that traffic pass through.\n\n389\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.350\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like Adele, Hello,\nFrom The Other Side?\n\n390\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n391\n00:21:21.485 --> 00:21:23.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; From The Other Side.\n\n392\n00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.170\nAll right, what else, proxies.\n\n393\n00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.490\nProxy server could be a forward proxy,\ncould be a reverse proxy.\n\n394\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.670\nA proxy typically performs many services.\n\n395\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.350\nNetwork address translation\nbeing one of them.\n\n396\n00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.590\nBut usually, we see proxies being used,\n\n397\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.960\nif we're talking about forward proxies,\nnormal proxies.\n\n398\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.530\nDidn't have to say that until they\ncame out with reverse proxies and\n\n399\n00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.640\nnow we've got to specify, forward proxy.\n\n400\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.527\nBut a proxy is one that we funnel all\nof our internet based traffic through.\n\n401\n00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:58.045\nLike from our corporate network, any user,\nany machine that needs internet access,\n\n402\n00:21:58.045 --> 00:22:01.839\nwe configure the proxy server\nin their internet settings.\n\n403\n00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:03.985\nAnd instead of sending it\nto the default gateway,\n\n404\n00:22:03.985 --> 00:22:06.890\nbasically the proxy server\nbecomes the default gateway.\n\n405\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.040\nFor your nodes, your end users.\n\n406\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.360\nAnd when that packet gets there,\nthe proxy server can do several things.\n\n407\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.690\nIt can do packet inspection.\n\n408\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.660\nIt can look inside that packet and see\nwhat web request you're trying to do and\n\n409\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.957\nsay, no, Facebook is not allowed,\nand drop the packet, and\n\n410\n00:22:21.957 --> 00:22:23.382\nnot let you go any further.\n\n411\n00:22:23.382 --> 00:22:27.755\nSo, you see proxies being used to\ncontrol what portion of the web my users\n\n412\n00:22:27.755 --> 00:22:29.057\nare allowed to go to.\n\n413\n00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:33.472\nIt also, as I said, does network\ntranslation I can use private internal IP\n\n414\n00:22:33.472 --> 00:22:38.326\naddresses, non routable IP addresses\ninternally, we are talking about IPD4.\n\n415\n00:22:38.326 --> 00:22:43.119\nAnd when I send my request to the proxy\nserver it's gonna remove my non\n\n416\n00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:45.200\nroutable IP address.\n\n417\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.940\nPlace its publicly routable\nIP address in its place,\n\n418\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.220\nsend the request out to say Google.\n\n419\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.280\nComes back not to me but\nto the proxy, because remember,\n\n420\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.780\nmy address has been removed.\n\n421\n00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.930\nGoogle knows nothing about me,\n\n422\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.370\nit thinks the proxy server\nis requesting the web page.\n\n423\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.860\nSo it sends it back to the proxy,\nthen the proxy through using a table,\n\n424\n00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.440\nhe wrote down my IP address\nbefore he took it off.\n\n425\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.990\nAnd I gave it, basically, a random\nport number to remember who was what.\n\n426\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.830\nAnd it says Google, yeah, that was Mike.\n\n427\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.880\nLet me take my IP address off and put his\nback on there and allow it to go back\n\n428\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.930\nthrough the network and I get Google,\nbut Google's not aware of me.\n\n429\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.415\nIt's a way to obfuscate your\ninternal network design.\n\n430\n00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:27.401\nMy IP addresses, they're non-routable\nanyway, they're not gonna go out.\n\n431\n00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:30.934\nBut even if they were public,\nthey would be translated and so\n\n432\n00:23:30.934 --> 00:23:34.380\nit would hide my internal\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\n433\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.475\nPlus, give me the ability, again,\nto control where my users are able to go.\n\n434\n00:23:39.475 --> 00:23:41.585\nI see proxies, well,\njust about everywhere now.\n\n435\n00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:45.384\nBut a few years ago, they were mostly\nused in schools and governments,\n\n436\n00:23:45.384 --> 00:23:47.931\nanywhere where they had\nto have tight control.\n\n437\n00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:52.155\nI don't need my students browsing to\ncertain sites, if you know what I mean.\n\n438\n00:23:52.155 --> 00:23:56.739\nSo we can use that proxy to just stop\nthose requests before they ever even Leave\n\n439\n00:23:56.739 --> 00:23:57.595\nour network.\n\n440\n00:23:57.595 --> 00:24:00.754\nYou go out to the VA and do some\ntraining and Facebook's not allowed,\n\n441\n00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:02.420\neBay's not allowed.\n\n442\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.658\nAll those places, those are not supposed\nto be monitoring their option at work.\n\n443\n00:24:07.658 --> 00:24:10.702\nSo those sites are blocked and\nthey're using a proxy to do that.\n\n444\n00:24:10.702 --> 00:24:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, We don't really have\nto have a dedicated device to this.\n\n445\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.720\nSome of the firewalls that you spoke of\nmay even have network address translation\n\n446\n00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.730\nas a feature integrated, built-in.\n\n447\n00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.108\nSo don't get confused by that, right?\n\n448\n00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:26.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact, if you guys,\nmost everybody out there,\n\n449\n00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:30.631\non their home network, probably has\na little D-Link or Linksys, and\n\n450\n00:24:30.631 --> 00:24:34.960\nyou're gonna call it a wireless\naccess point, right?\n\n451\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.060\nBut it's really a multi-function device.\n\n452\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.430\nWhen you look at those devices, you look\nat the back of it, you got a WAN port and\n\n453\n00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.870\nthen four LAN ports.\n\n454\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.301\nSo there's a one port switch.\n\n455\n00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:44.900\nThere's a one port router.\n\n456\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.618\n&gt;&gt; Like a switch, a wireless access point.\n\n457\n00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:48.835\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, yeah, there's a there's\na one port router going on in there.\n\n458\n00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:50.724\nThere's a four port\nswitch going on in there.\n\n459\n00:24:50.724 --> 00:24:52.835\nThere's a wireless access\npoint going on there.\n\n460\n00:24:52.835 --> 00:24:54.143\nThat was my signal for antennas.\n\n461\n00:24:54.143 --> 00:24:55.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sticking up.\n\n462\n00:24:55.025 --> 00:24:56.007\nThose are little antennas\nif you didn't know.\n\n463\n00:24:56.007 --> 00:24:57.008\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:24:57.008 --> 00:24:57.767\n&gt;&gt; And it's doing\n\n465\n00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:01.919\nnetwork address translation because we're\nusing private addresses internally,\n\n466\n00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.905\nyet we still have Internet access.\n\n467\n00:25:03.905 --> 00:25:08.105\nAnd it's probably doing DHCP\non top of being a firewall and\n\n468\n00:25:08.105 --> 00:25:10.200\ndoing port forwarding and\nthings like that.\n\n469\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.257\nSo, Cherokee, you're absolutely right.\n\n470\n00:25:12.257 --> 00:25:16.800\nAn ad is typically not deployed on\nits own, it's part of another device.\n\n471\n00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.200\nAnd nowadays, with these newer firewalls,\n\n472\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.110\nit might be that that one device\ndoes everything like our little.\n\n473\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.680\nIt's kind of funny you think about it,\n\n474\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.890\nour home devices have had all of this\nrolled up into one for a long time.\n\n475\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.540\nBut those aren't quite\nenterprise level devices.\n\n476\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.550\nThey can't handle the amount of traffic\nthat we would see in an enterprise.\n\n477\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.399\nBut now you look at these next generation\nfirewalls and they are beefy enough.\n\n478\n00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:42.923\nThey've got the processing power and\nthe RAM to be able to perform all\n\n479\n00:25:42.923 --> 00:25:47.790\nof those functionalities and\nnot degrade our performance too bad.\n\n480\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.640\nThat is one thing you look at,\nwhen you're doing a firewall set-up or\n\n481\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.170\nyou're buying a firewall, is performance.\n\n482\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.077\nThe deeper the inspection I do on the\npackets, the more time it's gonna take.\n\n483\n00:25:57.077 --> 00:26:01.176\nAnd if you're talking about every\nsingle packet coming into that network,\n\n484\n00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:03.490\nthat's a lot of work, right?\n\n485\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.058\nSo it can really slow your network down,\nif you try to do too much on an older\n\n486\n00:26:08.058 --> 00:26:11.318\ndevice, or\nthe device just wasn't designed to do.\n\n487\n00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:15.233\nAnd you look at some of those stateful\ninspection firewalls and they\n\n488\n00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:19.500\nwere on the edge of their performance,\nand they would slow traffic down.\n\n489\n00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.613\nAnd so you could step back what it was\ndoing as far as the packet inspection,\n\n490\n00:26:23.613 --> 00:26:25.656\nkind of help with your performance.\n\n491\n00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:29.905\n&gt;&gt; While also talking about performance,\nwhen you're talking about proxies,\n\n492\n00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:34.088\nsomething else that's pretty cool as\nfar as helping increase performance or\n\n493\n00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:38.395\ndecrease latency within your network would\nbe that if an end user went to go out to\n\n494\n00:26:38.395 --> 00:26:42.575\nthe Internet to grab and pull down a\ncatalog, maybe they had to order parts for\n\n495\n00:26:42.575 --> 00:26:45.960\ninventory for\na production company or something.\n\n496\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.520\nAnd maybe I got to work first,\nand then Mike got to work second.\n\n497\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.220\nBut we wouldn't necessarily need Mike to\ngo all the way out to the Internet because\n\n498\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.310\nthat proxy could also\ncache that information,\n\n499\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.130\nthus speeding up that internal\ncommunications, so there's another, yeah.\n\n500\n00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a big benefit.\n\n501\n00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:04.296\nCuz, I mean, most of your users, as you\nsay, are going to a lot of the same pages,\n\n502\n00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:06.880\nespecially if they're work-related pages.\n\n503\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.950\nSo by caching those on the proxy,\nyou never even leave the network.\n\n504\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:10.750\nIt's fantastic.\n\n505\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.372\nSo they can definitely\nhelp with performance.\n\n506\n00:27:13.372 --> 00:27:16.100\nAll right, Cherokee,\nI know we've got more to talk about,\n\n507\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.766\nbut I see you giving me that signal.\n\n508\n00:27:17.766 --> 00:27:18.635\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\nIt happens.\n\n509\n00:27:18.635 --> 00:27:19.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Mike.\n\n510\n00:27:19.722 --> 00:27:21.260\nBut we are out of time.\n\n511\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.520\nBut, ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned\nwe do have more GIAC headed your way.\n\n512\n00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.110\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n513\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.376\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n514\n00:27:28.376 --> 00:27:28.933\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n515\n00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:30.439\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n516\n00:27:30.439 --> 00:27:38.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n517\n00:27:38.181 -->

00:00:12.210\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.772\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:18.025\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.836\nThis is actually a part two where we will\nbe continuing looking at different types\n\n7\n00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:22.914\nof network security.\n\n8\n00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:25.504\nWith us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.762\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.566\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.437\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:32.391\nSo in this episode, as Cherokee said,\n\n13\n00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:36.245\nwe're continuing on with our network\nsecurity, looking at different types\n\n14\n00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:40.478\nof devices that we've put in place to keep\nour network safe as well as technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:42.677\nAnd that's kinda where\nwe're gonna go next.\n\n16\n00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:47.109\nWe wanna talk about VPNs or\nvirtual private networks.\n\n17\n00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.518\nThey call out on our objectives that\nwe're gonna need to have a high-level\n\n18\n00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.676\nunderstanding of VPNs or\nvirtual private networks.\n\n19\n00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:56.121\nAnd so, let's do.\n\n20\n00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.684\nLet's talk about them, so\nwe can have that high-level understanding.\n\n21\n00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:03.671\nWhen we talk about a VPN or a virtual\nprivate network, I guess first, we have to\n\n22\n00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:07.792\nthink about why we need them, and then\nwe'll talk about where we might put them.\n\n23\n00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:12.357\nAnd the reason we have these virtual\nprivate networks is because we\n\n24\n00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:17.345\nare taking advantage of unprotected\npublic network to transport data.\n\n25\n00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:22.759\nFor example, let's say I work with company\nXYZ and I'm allowed to go home and\n\n26\n00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.945\nthen connect back to the work network and\ndo work from home.\n\n27\n00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:30.996\nThe problem is,\nI'm connected to the Internet at home.\n\n28\n00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:32.860\nMy work is connected to the Internet.\n\n29\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.740\nThe Internet's one big fat mesh network,\nso it makes sense that I should be able to\n\n30\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.949\nconnect to my work network form home,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:40.128\nThe wiring is there,\n\n32\n00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:44.330\nthe electrical signal can make it from\nmy house to work no matter where it is.\n\n33\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.907\nBut the problem is I'm sending that signal\nover public networks out of my control.\n\n34\n00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:54.546\nAnd there's other people\non those networks and\n\n35\n00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:58.783\nthose people might not be as scrupulous or\nas nice as we would like them to be.\n\n36\n00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:02.254\nAnd so that means if I'm not protecting\nthat data that I'm sending across there,\n\n37\n00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.484\nsomebody could potentially\nsee that information.\n\n38\n00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:09.786\nCapture it and have access to my data.\n\n39\n00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:10.996\nSo we wanna protect it.\n\n40\n00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.901\nWe want to encapsulate it.\n\n41\n00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:16.160\nWe basically, when we say,\nmaking a tunnel.\n\n42\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.134\nWe say, virtual private network.\n\n43\n00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:20.677\nWe're gonna create a private network,\nbut it's virtual.\n\n44\n00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:24.453\nWe're not actually running\na cable from my house to work.\n\n45\n00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:29.146\nWe're using a protocol that's going\nto encapsulate those normal TCP\n\n46\n00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:31.780\npackets inside a tunneling protocol.\n\n47\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.758\nAnd that's what's giving us the tunnel,\nif you will.\n\n48\n00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:39.182\nSo those packets are protected as\nthey travel across the network,\n\n49\n00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:45.320\ngiving us in a sense a private network\nbetween my house and my corporate network.\n\n50\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.115\nThat's the idea behind a VPN.\n\n51\n00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:50.649\nWhen we look at VPNs,\nwe can really set them up one of two ways.\n\n52\n00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.973\nThe one I was just describing is what\nwe would call a remote access VPN,\n\n53\n00:02:54.973 --> 00:02:59.977\nbecause I'm accessing the internal\ncorporate network from a remote location.\n\n54\n00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:01.272\nBe that my house.\n\n55\n00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:08.065\nBe that Starbucks or the airport, or\nwherever I might have internet access.\n\n56\n00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:10.879\nI can try to establish this\nremote access connection.\n\n57\n00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.970\nBut they can also be used in what we call\na site-to-site connection, where I have\n\n58\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.885\na corporate office and a branch office,\nfor example, and people at the branch\n\n59\n00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:23.069\noffice need to make a connection back to\nthe corporate office to access resources.\n\n60\n00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.022\nThat's where most of my file\nservers are and that information,\n\n61\n00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.054\nthey don't have that at the branch office.\n\n62\n00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:32.364\nSo they're gonna run across the public\nnetwork to my corporate office.\n\n63\n00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:36.969\nWell, I don't want each user having to\nestablish their own VPN connection back to\n\n64\n00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.316\nthe corporate office.\n\n65\n00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:40.948\nWhat we can do is we can\nestablish a permanent or\n\n66\n00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:43.385\nsemi-permanent tunnel between the two.\n\n67\n00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.479\nWe'll have VPN endpoints\nat the corporate office and\n\n68\n00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:50.544\nthe branch office, and then we\nestablish a VPN tunnel between those.\n\n69\n00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.973\nAnd then my users at the branch office,\n\n70\n00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:57.021\ntheir traffic goes unprotected\nacross the branch area network,\n\n71\n00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.806\nto the VPN endpoint, then through\nthe tunnel between the two VPN endpoints,\n\n72\n00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:06.016\nand then gets stripped out of,\nthe encapsulation gets ripped off.\n\n73\n00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:08.766\nIt's a normal TCP packet on\nthe other end as it travels\n\n74\n00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:11.285\nacross the corporate\nnetwork on the other side.\n\n75\n00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:15.488\nSo we have established this tunnel between\ntwo endpoints where the data is protected\n\n76\n00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.046\nas it travels across that\npublic infrastructure.\n\n77\n00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:21.997\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, this seems like a better\noption than something that we'd see in\n\n78\n00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.851\nthe past, like an always-on circuit or\na lease line.\n\n79\n00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:28.828\nBecause using those protocols, I can\ngo ahead and build up that tunnel for\n\n80\n00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:32.114\ncommunication and\nthen tear it down on an as-needed basis.\n\n81\n00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:36.647\nSo I don't have that always on ping by the\nwhat usually mileage and then bandwidth,\n\n82\n00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:37.894\nit's pretty costly.\n\n83\n00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:40.699\nBut now we see a more efficient,\nlike a more effective,\n\n84\n00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.516\nmore cost-effective mechanism\nthat we can use today.\n\n85\n00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe VPN can really be setup, by the way.\n\n86\n00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:50.250\nIt could be a demand dial-type\nconnection that you're setting up or\n\n87\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.551\nit could be as you said, a more permanent\nsolution between those two endpoints.\n\n88\n00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:58.078\nNow, let's see where\nwe're gonna do with this.\n\n89\n00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:00.150\nSo we were talking about\nthe types of VPNs that we have.\n\n90\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.190\nReally again, for this exam,\n\n91\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.748\nlet's just focus in on remote\naccess VPNs and site-to-site VPNs.\n\n92\n00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:10.766\nNow, technologies that we use, they\nlist a few of them that I wanna go over.\n\n93\n00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.554\nThe first one, we're actually\ngonna come back to the first one.\n\n94\n00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:18.694\nThe first one is IPsec or Internet\nProtocol Security, shortened up to IPsec.\n\n95\n00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:23.442\nThey also talk about L2TP,\nwhich is a Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n96\n00:05:23.442 --> 00:05:27.485\nTalk about PPTP, which is our\nPoint to Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n97\n00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:31.824\nWe also have SSH, TLS.\n\n98\n00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:35.531\nWe have,\nwhat's the other one I wanna mention?\n\n99\n00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:37.734\nI already said,\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n100\n00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:38.679\n&gt;&gt; Did you say L2TP?\n\n101\n00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:41.959\n&gt;&gt; And I did say, L2TP, right, SSL, TLS.\n\n102\n00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.196\nOpenVPN would be another\none that they mentioned-\n\n103\n00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.742\n&gt;&gt; Lightweight protocol?\n\n104\n00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:48.668\n&gt;&gt; In the objectives.\nYep, it's a open source VPN solution.\n\n105\n00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:51.407\nSSH can be used to create a tunnel, right.\n\n106\n00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:53.391\nAnything that we're using really,\n\n107\n00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:56.655\nany protocol that we can use to\nencapsulate those packets and\n\n108\n00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:00.565\nprovide protection for them would\nbe considered a tunneling protocol.\n\n109\n00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:03.437\nBut those are the main ones, the ones we\nneed to be familiar with for this exam.\n\n110\n00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:04.761\nAnd so let's talk about them.\n\n111\n00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.249\nI'm gonna kinda start at the back or\nat the early on and\n\n112\n00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.042\nkinda work my way forward.\n\n113\n00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:15.253\nPPTP, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\nis probably one\n\n114\n00:06:15.253 --> 00:06:21.777\nof the older tunneling mechanisms or\ntunneling protocols that we could use.\n\n115\n00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:24.110\nAgain, it stands for\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n116\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.901\nAnd it uses PPP for its encryption,\n\n117\n00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:31.470\nPoint-to-Point Protocol's\nencryption capability.\n\n118\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.119\nSo it's built in to PPTP.\n\n119\n00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.840\nPPTP is very common,\nsupported by almost all devices,\n\n120\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.145\ncuz it's been around for so long.\n\n121\n00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:44.263\nThe good think to know about PPTP\nis it does have built-in encryption\n\n122\n00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:45.259\ncapabilities.\n\n123\n00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.224\nAnd you'll understand why\nwhen I come to the next one,\n\n124\n00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:50.490\nlike why does he make\nthat such a big deal?\n\n125\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.836\nBecause L2TP, which came out after PPTP,\nis my Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n126\n00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:59.352\nAnd another great tunneling protocol,\nwe can use it in our VPNs, but\n\n127\n00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:03.429\nit didn't have any built-in encryption\ncapabilities, which is kind of odd.\n\n128\n00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:05.518\nBut it leveraged something else.\n\n129\n00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:07.059\nYou had to bring something along with it.\n\n130\n00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.303\n99% of the time, that's gonna be IPsec.\n\n131\n00:07:10.303 --> 00:07:15.300\nYou almost always see it written\nL2TP/IPsec, because L2TP\n\n132\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.307\nwithout IPsec is kind of just\nlike sending your data out there.\n\n133\n00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:24.398\nIt can do some authentication of either\nend, but it's not encrypting the data.\n\n134\n00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:28.542\nAnd that's one of the main priorities\nas I'm traveling across that public\n\n135\n00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:33.213\ninfrastructure is having the ability to\nenable encryption to protect the payload,\n\n136\n00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:34.744\nthe data in those packets.\n\n137\n00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:36.973\nSo keep that in mind, L2TP is great, but\n\n138\n00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:41.141\nyou need to bring something else along\nif you're gonna provide encryption.\n\n139\n00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:42.864\nSSL and TLS.\n\n140\n00:07:42.864 --> 00:07:45.860\nThese are relatively new\nto the tunneling protocols.\n\n141\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.707\nI mean, they've been around.\n\n142\n00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:47.917\nSSL's been around.\n\n143\n00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:54.358\nTLS is kind of the replacement for\nSSL once 3.0 has proved vulnerable.\n\n144\n00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:59.344\nBut they can be used for\nVPN solutions as well.\n\n145\n00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:03.348\nAnd nice thing about that\nUsing something like SSL or\n\n146\n00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:08.444\nTLS to do your VPNs is they're\nnormally going across port 443,\n\n147\n00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:11.940\nwhich is already open on most firewalls.\n\n148\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.000\nThat's an issue you can run into with\nthings like PBTP, which is what?\n\n149\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.220\n17, 23 and L2TP which I think is 1701,\nor I might have those backwards.\n\n150\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.870\nBut those are,\nif all the firewalls between me and\n\n151\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.340\nthe other end of the VPN are under\nmy control, might not be a problem.\n\n152\n00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.030\nBut what if I have to go through\na public firewall somewhere.\n\n153\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.550\nThose ports might not be open.\n\n154\n00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.140\nThey might not be passing PPTP traffic.\n\n155\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.000\nSo with SSL or TLS,\nwe usually don't have a problem with\n\n156\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.585\nblocking that traffic because 80 and\n443 are usually available.\n\n157\n00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:45.500\nAlright?\n\n158\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.860\nWhat else do we want to talk about though?\n\n159\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.900\nSo that's probably good for that.\n\n160\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.920\nWe'll go back to IPSEC, as I mentioned\nIP sec is, we can actually create IPSEC\n\n161\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.940\ntunnels or we can use IPSEC along\nwith L2TP to provide that encryption.\n\n162\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.520\n&gt;&gt; Additional security.\n\n163\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.595\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and with IPSEC, one of the\ngreat things about IPSEC is the fact that\n\n164\n00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:12.765\nit works really low on the, gosh,\nwhat is it, layer two, layer three?\n\n165\n00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:14.775\nIt's really low on the OSI model,\n\n166\n00:09:14.775 --> 00:09:18.165\nwhich means the applications\ndon't have to be aware.\n\n167\n00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:21.665\nWhen we look at SSL or TLS,\n\n168\n00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:25.425\nit's our browser that's actually\nsetting that up and doing that.\n\n169\n00:09:25.425 --> 00:09:30.510\nOur browser has to support SSL or TLS, or\nwhatever application we're talking about.\n\n170\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.020\nIt needs to support that.\n\n171\n00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.390\nWhen we talk about IPSEC,\n\n172\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.990\nit's way down on the OSI model and\nit's application independent.\n\n173\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:43.250\nThe application doesn't have to understand\nIPSEC because it sends its data and then\n\n174\n00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.080\nas my data travels down through the OSI\nmodel, eventually it gets its encryption.\n\n175\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.200\nIt gets passed across a network and then\nas we work up that model on the receiving\n\n176\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.680\nend, the encryption is removed well before\nit ever makes it up to the application and\n\n177\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.840\nsession presentation layers up there.\n\n178\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.580\nSo the application is completely\nindependent from the encryption.\n\n179\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.710\nWhich means you can take even old\napplications that don't support any type\n\n180\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.215\nof encryption and protect their\ndata using something like IPSEC.\n\n181\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.240\nAll right?\n\n182\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.060\nI will mention briefly, like I said,\n\n183\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.210\nthey don't really go into detail on\nthis but let's make sure we understand\n\n184\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.730\nthat IP sec has a couple of different\nmodes that can run this in.\n\n185\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.280\nIt's got what's called transport mode and\ntunnel mode.\n\n186\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.500\nAnd when we look at transport mode, only\n\n187\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.900\nthe packet information is going to be,\n\n188\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.920\nthe payload I should say is gonna\nbe encrypted in transport mode.\n\n189\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.270\nAnd what that means, really,\n\n190\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.430\nto us is that the original\nheader is not getting modified.\n\n191\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.520\nWhich means things like NAT shouldn't\nhave a problem working with this.\n\n192\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.960\nWe get into tunnel mode, now we're talking\nabout encapsulating the entire packet.\n\n193\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.670\nYou can kind of think of transport mode,\nif you took a packet.\n\n194\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.990\nYou said all right,\nhere's the header, here's my payload.\n\n195\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.730\nI'm gonna take the payload,\n\n196\n00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.650\ncut it off, slip another little IPsec\nheader in there and then the payload.\n\n197\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.718\nMy original header's still\nout there in the beginning.\n\n198\n00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:10.309\nWith tunnel mode we are going to\ntake the entire packet header,\n\n199\n00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:13.170\npayload and the whole she bang.\n\n200\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.110\nAnd then we're going to put\nthe IP header in the very front.\n\n201\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.330\nAnd encapsulate the entire thing.\n\n202\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.940\nWhich gives you more protection as far\nmaking sure that there are headers get\n\n203\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.690\nmodified and things like that but\n\n204\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.010\nit also means it can cause problems with\nthings like network address translation.\n\n205\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.440\nThere's workarounds for\nthat, there's NAT-T.\n\n206\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.740\nIt's nothing new,\nthis has been around for a while.\n\n207\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.870\nBut just wanted to make you\naware of those two modes.\n\n208\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.970\nYou also have,\nyou can either setup IPsec and\n\n209\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.540\nwhat's called authentication header or\nESP.\n\n210\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.950\nAuthentication header.\n\n211\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.080\nOr ESP, encapsulation security payload.\n\n212\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.870\nOnly does integrity.\n\n213\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.350\nIt's making sure that stuff\nhasn't been modified.\n\n214\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.560\n&gt;&gt; Using a hash algorithm.\n\n215\n00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Using hashes exactly.\n\n216\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.876\nBut it does not do anything to\nprotect the data for confidentiality.\n\n217\n00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:05.040\nSo it's a good example, what do you\nget from authentication header,\n\n218\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.420\nwell you get data integrity bit you\ndo not get data confidentiality,\n\n219\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.430\nyou do ESP, security pay load, you'll\nstill get the authentication header,\n\n220\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.400\nyou'll still get the integrity but\nyou also get the encryption or\n\n221\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.710\nthe confidentiality, so we talk about\nwhat does this protocol provide?\n\n222\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.630\nThe telemode is gonna be integrity\nas well as confidentiality.\n\n223\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Alright Cherokee, so\n\n224\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.420\nthat takes care of our\ntunneling protocols,\n\n225\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.610\nlet's move on in to what we\ncall web app security and\n\n226\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.600\nwhen it comes to web app security\nwe probably have an idea now.\n\n227\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.870\nWeb applications, or web traffic,\ntravels across port 80 by default,\n\n228\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.680\n443 for my HTTPS.\n\n229\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:57.010\nHTTP, hypertext transport protocol, is the\nlanguage we use to move web data, right?\n\n230\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:03.090\nWhen I type in a URL in my\nbrowser I'm using HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n231\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.860\nThe code for\n\n232\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:09.090\nthe web pages themselves, that's HTML,\nthe hypertext markup language.\n\n233\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.930\nThat's what the actual pages are written\nin, that's not the transport protocol.\n\n234\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.440\nSo a transport for\nour web is gonna be either HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n235\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:23.180\nWhen we look at securing that\nbecause HTTP if I can slow down and\n\n236\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.160\nsay that is plain text.\n\n237\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.680\nRight?\nThat means that information is\n\n238\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.180\nnot protected, not encrypted,\nno confidentiality.\n\n239\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.295\nAnybody gets in between you and\nthe web server.\n\n240\n00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:35.995\nWho ever you're having that conversation\nwith can intercept those packets and\n\n241\n00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:37.265\nread them as plain as day.\n\n242\n00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:40.955\nThey can simply look at the packets and\nsee exactly what you're browsing,\n\n243\n00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:42.995\nwhat web page, what have you.\n\n244\n00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:45.255\nWe're gonna secure that and\n\n245\n00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:50.030\nput a little s at the end of that and\nnow we have secure HTTP or HTTPS,\n\n246\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:56.170\nhyper text transfer protocol secure and\nnow that it will be encrypted, right?\n\n247\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.440\nAs long as both ends\nare using the same protocols.\n\n248\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.340\nNow we're talking about the two\ndifferent protocols we use here.\n\n249\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.460\nWe're talking about SSL or\nsecure socket layer.\n\n250\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.400\nAnd TLS, transport layer security.\n\n251\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.890\nAnd you know depending on if you go\nout there and read on this stuff and\n\n252\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:19.050\nit can be a little confusing because\nthey'll tell you that TLS is SSL.\n\n253\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.130\nOr a lot of places will tell\nyou that it is and it isn't.\n\n254\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.750\nYou know, they're not the same letter so\nthey can't be exactly the same right?\n\n255\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.530\nNow, SSL was developed\nby Netscape back in,\n\n256\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.370\nI wanna say 98, something like that,\nit's been a little while.\n\n257\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.120\n&gt;&gt; It's antiquated.\n\n258\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little old.\n\n259\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.130\nBut TLS was developed to\ndo a couple of things.\n\n260\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.927\nOne, standardize the SSL and\ntake it away from it not\n\n261\n00:14:47.927 --> 00:14:53.150\nbeing a What's the word I'm looking for?\n\n262\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.020\nNow it's just standard,\n\n263\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.790\nit's not just Netscape's-\n&gt;&gt; Proprietary\n\n264\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.260\n&gt;&gt; Proprietary protocol anymore, yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then you have all these different\n\n266\n00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.220\nversions of it.\n\n267\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.530\nTLS was trying to get away from that.\n\n268\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.560\nAnd it also did some things to improve SSL\n\n269\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.180\nto make it stronger because it\nwas developed quite a while ago.\n\n270\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.210\nNow SSL's gone through\na few modifications.\n\n271\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.270\nYou had SSL1, SSL2, SSL3.\n\n272\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:21.260\nA lot of people will tell you\nthat TLS1.0 is SSL 3.1, right?\n\n273\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.790\nIt's just the next thing.\n\n274\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.130\nThey've had to change the letters for\nany potential\n\n275\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.330\nlegal ramifications that might come,\nif they continue to use the name SSL.\n\n276\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.860\nCuz maybe somebody gets back in and\nsays, we're gonna sue you know.\n\n277\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.040\nAnyway, that's neither here nor there.\n\n278\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.160\nWe don't care about that.\n\n279\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.960\nThe one thing I will make sure\nwe understand with these two is\n\n280\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.670\nthey're not the same.\n\n281\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.390\nThey're not compatible with each other.\n\n282\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.420\nIf they're, the protocols are the same.\n\n283\n00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.483\nOr, that's not a good way of saying-\n&gt;&gt; Here,\n\n284\n00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:51.554\nlet me just look at it\nfrom this perspective.\n\n285\n00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:53.534\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Because I know I've set up devices, and\n\n286\n00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:55.550\nlike when you were talking\nabout our firewalls.\n\n287\n00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.072\nAnd if we have any kind of\nRemote authentication servers.\n\n288\n00:15:59.072 --> 00:16:01.281\nAnd what kind of connections\nam I gonna allow for\n\n289\n00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.500\nmy remote users to be\nconnecting to my network.\n\n290\n00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:10.440\nI can say, I am allowing SSL version 1.0,\nSSL version 2.0, and TLS.\n\n291\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.860\nSo, I'm allowing all three.\n\n292\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.350\nMeaning that that particular connection\nserver, the authentication server,\n\n293\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.900\nmay allow, may be backwards compatible\nwith those older protocols.\n\n294\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.260\nBut, it weakens.\n\n295\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.230\nOr I guess you have to look at\nit from a security perspective.\n\n296\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.490\nDo I want to allow those older,\nmore antiquated protocols,\n\n297\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.560\nthose devices running those protocols,\nto be connecting to my network.\n\n298\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.510\nAnd that's just a question you'll\nhave to ask yourself or your company.\n\n299\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's a decision you've gotta make, and\n\n300\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.800\nhopefully it's nothing before\n[LAUGH] TLS is allowed anymore.\n\n301\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.430\n&gt;&gt; You know what, we joke Mike but\nI'm not even kidding.\n\n302\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.020\nThe other night I was checking out and\nI want to say it was Best Buy's site but\n\n303\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.830\ndon't quote me on this, but\nI'm pretty sure it was Best Buy.\n\n304\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.765\nAnd I as soon as I checked out and\nswitched over to\n\n305\n00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:57.930\nSSL secure socket slayer and\nI was thinking, wouldn't they know better.\n\n306\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.555\nBut you know we do still\nsee the use out there.\n\n307\n00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:03.645\n&gt;&gt; Like you said it's for compatibility.\n\n308\n00:17:03.645 --> 00:17:06.465\n&gt;&gt; If I'm an e-commerce site-\n&gt;&gt; I wanna stop my sales.\n\n309\n00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:09.785\n&gt;&gt; Of course I want to use the best,\nlatest, and greatest secure protocols.\n\n310\n00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:13.755\nBut I also don't want to prevent someone\nwho is still using Windows XP in that\n\n311\n00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:17.700\nold browser from being able to connect to\nmy site and being able to set up at least\n\n312\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.765\na semi secure connection is\nbetter than no security at all.\n\n313\n00:17:20.765 --> 00:17:22.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n314\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.860\nYou think.\nAt\n\n315\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.621\nleast that's what I'm gonna\ntry to convince myself.\n\n316\n00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.228\n&gt;&gt; E for effort.\n\n317\n00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:26.045\n&gt;&gt; I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:26.746\nBut yeah, exactly.\n\n319\n00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:28.749\nThat's what we got to think, E for effort.\n\n320\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.210\nSo anyway the point is, if one is speaking\nSSL and the other is speaking TLS,\n\n321\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.270\nit's not gonna work.\n\n322\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.210\nIf I have my browser or my configuration\nor my machine is, do not use SSL,\n\n323\n00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.260\nonly use TLS and if your web\nserver doesn't understand TLS yet,\n\n324\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.110\nyou've only got it configured\nto use SSL two and three.\n\n325\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.410\nYou're not going to be able to set\nup secure communications there.\n\n326\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.290\nThey are different enough to\nwhere they are not compatible.\n\n327\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.910\nAnd and they did that on purpose.\n\n328\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.800\nAll right it wasn't an gosh\nwe goofed type thing.\n\n329\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.710\nWe wanted to get away.\n\n330\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.530\nOne of the problems with making\nthings backwards compatible.\n\n331\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.320\nIs you're bringing all\nthe vulnerabilities with you.\n\n332\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.260\nAt some point you've got to\ndraw a line in the sand and\n\n333\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.420\nsay look we can not\ncontinue to support this.\n\n334\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.190\nIt's too old.\n\n335\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.450\nIt's too outdated.\n\n336\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.510\nWe're sorry.\n\n337\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.990\nYou need to get with the rest\nof the world and catch.\n\n338\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.090\nSo, drawing that line,\nthat's kind of what TLS is.\n\n339\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.150\nThis is it.\n\n340\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.900\nFrom here on, we're moving forward.\n\n341\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.140\nWe're going to call it\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n342\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.920\nWhat else do we want to\nknow about those guys.\n\n343\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.850\nSo updated, standardized SSL.\n\n344\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.800\nAs far as, and again I don't know that\nthey would get you on this on the exam.\n\n345\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.040\nBut do understand that at this point\nas of recording this information\n\n346\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.230\nSSL 3.0 is proven to be insecure.\n\n347\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.220\nIt has vulnerabilities that\ncan be taken advantage of.\n\n348\n00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.240\nShouldn't really be used anymore.\n\n349\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.776\nIt is for backwards compatibility,\nbut we should move on.\n\n350\n00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:58.544\nTLS 1.0 again was kind of\nlike SSL 3.1 if we will but\n\n351\n00:18:58.544 --> 00:19:03.728\nTLS I can't remember,\nI want to say two but\n\n352\n00:19:03.728 --> 00:19:09.230\nmuch better than using SSL active content.\n\n353\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.220\nWhen it comes to web application security,\nwe've got to mention active content.\n\n354\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.610\nThis is the pretty stuff\nyou see on your webpage.\n\n355\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.420\nThe moving things.\n\n356\n00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.630\nTypically some kind of scripting\nlanguage like JavaScript, or Java,\n\n357\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.500\nor Active X if anybody\nstill uses Active X.\n\n358\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.460\nFor buttons and things like that.\n\n359\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.510\nIt's what gives web pages functionality.\n\n360\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.510\nAnd before we had anything else,\n\n361\n00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.110\nwe go way back in the day, you open\nup a web page and it was just static.\n\n362\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.670\nIt was a background color,\nsome fonts, maybe a picture\n\n363\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.990\nMaybe a moving gif of some kind-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like those.\n\n364\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.760\nWhat do they call those.\n\n365\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.490\nCrazy fruit salad where they have the\nblack background, and the hot pink, and\n\n366\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.420\nthe yellow, and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.060\n&gt;&gt; All these are matching crazy colors.\n\n368\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.840\nCrazy for selling.\n\n369\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Kinda strange if you go back and\n\n371\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240\nlook at some of those sites.\n\n372\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.870\nBut yeah,\nback then it was that's all we have.\n\n373\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.065\n&gt;&gt; This is so cool.\n\n374\n00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.440\nOver-sharing information.\n\n375\n00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little MIDI music\ngoing on in the background.\n\n376\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.700\nWho doesn't love good MIDI music.\n\n377\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.300\nBut with active pages,\n\n378\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.320\nwe started providing a little\nbit fancier stuff, right?\n\n379\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.720\nWe had interactivity, dynamic content,\nwhere when I go to a website it says, Hey,\n\n380\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.560\nwelcome back, Mike.\n\n381\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.010\nThere's a new book in\nyour favorite category.\n\n382\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.800\n&gt;&gt; Pretty interactive.\n\n383\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.530\n&gt;&gt; Or\ndrop down list that I can use to flip.\n\n384\n00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.590\nAny kind of that interactivity, that's the\ndynamic content or as they're gonna call\n\n385\n00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.480\nit here, active content,\ndynamic content, kind of the same thing.\n\n386\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.530\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, not trying to throw you off.\n\n387\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.499\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, that's all right.\n\n388\n00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:34.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I use dynamic and\n\n389\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.450\nin the objectives they\ncall it active content.\n\n390\n00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but either way, we're talking\nabout things that really take some kind of\n\n391\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.600\nuser input, whether that's a click or\nfilling in a field and a form.\n\n392\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.930\nAnd it changes something\nabout the web page.\n\n393\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.470\nOr things move on the web page\nbased on timing in a script.\n\n394\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.420\nAnd the problem is that the bad\nguys can then take advantage of\n\n395\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.560\nthe scripting languages.\n\n396\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.450\nAnd they were creating that\nthat active content with and\n\n397\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.730\nthen that becomes a vulnerability and\nwe see this all over the place.\n\n398\n00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.620\nWell, what's the latest one you\nknow it's flash is a common one.\n\n399\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.550\nFlash is great.\n\n400\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.630\nI love playing with flash, you could make\nlittle you know, animations and stuff.\n\n401\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.830\nAnd it made web pages a little more\nexciting if you're using it there.\n\n402\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.230\nBut It has some vulnerabilities\nassociated with it, it's a little older.\n\n403\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Some companies will just say,\nlook, it's prohibited.\n\n404\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.640\nBecause really, if you think about it,\nit's coding, and extra coding means that\n\n405\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.270\nthere's a potential you're just\nincreasing that surface attack area.\n\n406\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nit's something that's allowed to run.\n\n407\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.890\nAnd so any time you've got\nsomething that can execute or\n\n408\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.920\nrun, ff I can get my code in there,\nit's not gonna be a good day for you guys.\n\n409\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.850\nSo that's the problem with active content.\n\n410\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.350\nYes, it gives us fancy pages.\n\n411\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.750\nIt makes our webpage nice, makes it\ninteractive, but it can also be, or\n\n412\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.800\nlead to vulnerabilities because they're\ngonna take advantage of the language\n\n413\n00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.750\nthat's being used to provide\nthat active content.\n\n414\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.930\nSo it's not so much the web server\nthat's the vulnerability in this case.\n\n415\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.170\nIt's the scripting that we're using\nto provide that active content.\n\n416\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.110\nWeb servers are just in general,\n\n417\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.880\nweb servers are a very big Target for\na couple of reasons.\n\n418\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.050\nPrimarily because they\nare almost always exposed.\n\n419\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.120\nAnd we've got internal web\nservers that we might use for\n\n420\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.090\nin house calendars and\nappointments, things like that.\n\n421\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.755\nBut for the most part.\n\n422\n00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:30.365\nOr we set up a web server so that the\npublic can come and buy our product, or\n\n423\n00:22:30.365 --> 00:22:34.735\nlearn about our company, or watch our\nvideos, like you guys are doing now.\n\n424\n00:22:34.735 --> 00:22:39.525\nSo they have to be exposed to the outside\nworld, and that right there means,\n\n425\n00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.430\nwe've got an attack.\n\n426\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.700\nThat people from the outside\ncan hit it legitimately.\n\n427\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.050\nBut that means they can\nalso do other things.\n\n428\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.140\nThey can try to do things\nit wasn't designed to do,\n\n429\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.520\ntake advantage of the fact that we\nhave to be listening for connections.\n\n430\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.850\nA web server that's not listening for\n\n431\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.860\nconnections is not gonna\nserve too many web pages.\n\n432\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.420\nSo I mean it has to be\nlistening as its job.\n\n433\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.490\nThe bad guys are gonna try\nto take advantage of that.\n\n434\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.340\nThat file server on my internal\nnetwork has no public exposure.\n\n435\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.040\nIt doesn't have a public IP address,\nit doesn't have services that are running\n\n436\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.010\nthat are listening, or\nconnections from the outside.\n\n437\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.810\nA lot less attack or a lot less\nissues that I have to deal with.\n\n438\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.550\nThat web server on the other hand,\n\n439\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:22.490\neverybody can see it,\neverybody's gonna try to target that.\n\n440\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.300\nI'll show you guys a quick web page here,\nit's just the OWASP top ten.\n\n441\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.610\nThese guys put out some great content,\nI'll scroll back up to the top here.\n\n442\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.530\nThe Open Web Application Security Project,\nyou can Google or use your favorite search\n\n443\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:41.290\nengine to find them, but\nthey deal with Web server security.\n\n444\n00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.220\nAnd they put out a top-ten list\nthat they update every so often.\n\n445\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.270\nAnd in the exams,\n\n446\n00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.740\nthey talk about understanding what some\nof the common attacks are on web servers.\n\n447\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.964\nI thought well, what better to\nshow you than the OWASP top-ten.\n\n448\n00:23:53.964 --> 00:23:58.190\nBecause these are the top-ten attacks that\nare being performed against web servers.\n\n449\n00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.675\nThey've got the 2010 list\nover here on the left.\n\n450\n00:24:00.675 --> 00:24:06.247\nThe 2013 list over here on the right,\nif I can get my bar to go away.\n\n451\n00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:10.135\nAnyway, love it when my little\ndrop down bar comes down,\n\n452\n00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:13.620\nand then doesn't wanna go back up,\nthere it goes.\n\n453\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.467\nTop one is injection, and\nyou can see this both on 2010 and 2013.\n\n454\n00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:19.832\nHere we're talking about\ncommand injection,\n\n455\n00:24:19.832 --> 00:24:22.900\na lot of you might've heard\nof this as SQL injection.\n\n456\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.470\nDoesn't necessarily have to be SQL,\n\n457\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.700\ncommand injection's\nprobably a better term.\n\n458\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.710\nBut because we're taking input, most\nwebsites if you're gonna place orders or\n\n459\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.730\nhave a blog, or anything like that\nthat's gonna accept input from a user,\n\n460\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.900\nespecially an unauthenticated user,\nwe run the risk.\n\n461\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.240\nAnd really, I shouldn't say\nthe authentication part cuz it doesn't\n\n462\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.660\nhave much to do with that,\nbut we've got a field.\n\n463\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.990\nUsers can type in and\n\n464\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.800\nthat information gets sent back\nto the backend to be processed.\n\n465\n00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.108\nAny time I've got that scenario going\non I run the risk of injection.\n\n466\n00:24:55.108 --> 00:24:58.940\nBecause I'm gonna try to figure out a way\nto, you've asked for my first name and\n\n467\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.850\nlast name.\n\n468\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:04.945\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put\nan apostrophe dash dash or one equals one.\n\n469\n00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:09.380\nAnd I'm gonna basically say select\nall from, and drop your tables or\n\n470\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.840\nsomething like that.\n\n471\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.463\nWe can start inserting commands.\n\n472\n00:25:12.463 --> 00:25:16.684\nSo one of the primary attacks\nis against web servers.\n\n473\n00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:21.040\n&gt;&gt; And I think the biggest defense\nagainst that would be input validation.\n\n474\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.272\nBut in real life LAN, sometimes we\nhave deadlines, and [LAUGH] sometimes\n\n475\n00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:31.608\ncompanies are kind of looking at\nquantity not quality, unfortunately.\n\n476\n00:25:31.608 --> 00:25:33.993\nAnd that's just what happens there.\n\n477\n00:25:33.993 --> 00:25:34.999\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\n\n478\n00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:39.961\nit's honestly, it's relatively easy to\ndefend against cuz as you said, it's just,\n\n479\n00:25:39.961 --> 00:25:44.470\nshould they be allowed to put special\ncharacters in that last name field.\n\n480\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.100\nAnd then the answer is most likely no,\nexcept for maybe a hyphen.\n\n481\n00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.699\nThere are many ways we can do what we\ncall input validation on those fields to\n\n482\n00:25:52.699 --> 00:25:54.468\nprevent that kind of attack.\n\n483\n00:25:54.468 --> 00:25:56.408\nAnd I'm not gonna list all of these here,\n\n484\n00:25:56.408 --> 00:25:58.810\nI mean you guys have got\nthem on your screen.\n\n485\n00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.380\nBut cross-site scripting\nis another big one.\n\n486\n00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:06.790\nThis is where we're going to try\nto find a vulnerable web server,\n\n487\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.150\nand then load up our\nattack on the web server.\n\n488\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.358\nAnd then when the legitimate user hits\nthat web page, they're gonna get attacked.\n\n489\n00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:16.930\nSo we're bouncing, basically bouncing\nit or loading the attack up, and\n\n490\n00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.690\nthen letting the attack take place from\nthe web server via cross-site scripting.\n\n491\n00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.610\nSecurity misconfiguration is another\nbig problem with web servers.\n\n492\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't look like\nwe're at a shortage here.\n\n493\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.780\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n494\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.993\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like we're at\na shortage, it's like go ahead,\n\n495\n00:26:29.993 --> 00:26:30.931\npick your poison, right?\n\n496\n00:26:30.931 --> 00:26:34.473\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, there's so\nmany to choose from,\n\n497\n00:26:34.473 --> 00:26:36.559\nmisconfiguration is a big one.\n\n498\n00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:42.365\nCross-site request forgeries are bad,\nunvalid redirects and forwards.\n\n499\n00:26:42.365 --> 00:26:46.120\nI mean the list just goes, as you said it,\nCherokee, it just goes on and on and on.\n\n500\n00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.742\nAnd most of these, the funny thing is,\nif you look at them,\n\n501\n00:26:48.742 --> 00:26:51.220\nthat the first three\nhaven't changed since 2010.\n\n502\n00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.567\nThey'll mostly be, the new list is\ncoming out, should be out soon,\n\n503\n00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:58.261\nI wanna say it was 2016, so\nhopefully they're compiling their data and\n\n504\n00:26:58.261 --> 00:26:59.842\ngetting ready for a new report.\n\n505\n00:26:59.842 --> 00:27:04.998\nOdds are injection, cross-site\nscripting will be in the top three.\n\n506\n00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:11.602\nAnd not a huge change as\nwe go from 2010 to 2013.\n\n507\n00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:14.835\nAll right, so you can take that list down,\njust wanted to show you that,\n\n508\n00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:16.703\nspoofing is a big problem with web pages.\n\n509\n00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:21.201\nPretending to be somebody you're not,\nwhether that's through cookie tampering,\n\n510\n00:27:21.201 --> 00:27:23.710\nor cookie stealing or\ncross-site forgeries.\n\n511\n00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.843\nPretending that I am somebody that I'm not\nso that I can get access to a web page or\n\n512\n00:27:27.843 --> 00:27:28.969\naccess that server.\n\n513\n00:27:28.969 --> 00:27:34.648\nThey talk about repudiation, again,\nwhich is kind of along the same thing.\n\n514\n00:27:34.648 --> 00:27:39.586\nNon-repudiation is making sure\nthat I know who I'm talking to or\n\n515\n00:27:39.586 --> 00:27:42.834\nthe originator of the data is verifiable.\n\n516\n00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:45.690\nRepudiation would mean\nthat I didn't have that,\n\n517\n00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.390\nit could be talking to a phishing server\nthat was pretending to be Bank of America.\n\n518\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.090\nInformation disclosure happens\nthrough attacks on web servers,\n\n519\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.730\nbecause our web servers store\ndata about their visitors.\n\n520\n00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.850\nIt might be user names and passwords that\nare used to authenticate to that website.\n\n521\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.976\nCould be credit card information,\nbecause I know you guys like to check that\n\n522\n00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:13.517\nbox that says remember me and save my\ncredit card, set up my one-click shopping.\n\n523\n00:28:13.517 --> 00:28:14.295\nNo, no.\n\n524\n00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:14.985\n&gt;&gt; How'd you know?\n\n525\n00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.532\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, [LAUGH] right?\n\n526\n00:28:16.532 --> 00:28:20.085\nIt's like, I know it's a pain to go and\nget your wallet or your purse and\n\n527\n00:28:20.085 --> 00:28:23.250\npull the credit card out,\ntype in that number.\n\n528\n00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.680\nIt is a pain, right?\n\n529\n00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.447\nBut the alternative is to store\nyour credit card with that site,\n\n530\n00:28:29.447 --> 00:28:31.755\nwhich most of the time is okay.\n\n531\n00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:34.040\nUntil they get compromised, right?\n\n532\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.840\nThat's the problem, is if you go and you\nstore your information on some of these\n\n533\n00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.230\nweb sites and then their database gets\ncompromised, your information is released.\n\n534\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.710\nHow many have gotten the calls from\nyour bank that says, hey look,\n\n535\n00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.720\nwe're issuing you a new card.\n\n536\n00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.660\nNo indication of an attack or\nnothing has happened, but your information\n\n537\n00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.160\nwas part of this database that was\nreleased by such and such company.\n\n538\n00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.510\nAnd there's the chance that your\ninformation is now out there, so\n\n539\n00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.800\nwe're gonna send you a new card and\na new number, right?\n\n540\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.340\nThat's usually where we get compromised.\n\n541\n00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.140\nThe transaction is secure,\nI mean we've got HTTPS, and\n\n542\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.650\nit's doubtful anybody's getting in between\nus and decrypting that information.\n\n543\n00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.870\nThe problem is, is I've chosen to\nstore that information up there.\n\n544\n00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.690\nAnd their web servers,\ntheir database servers are vulnerable\n\n545\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.878\nto attack from the outside and\ninternally, and that poses the risk.\n\n546\n00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:25.870\nDenial-of-service is another\ncommon attack on a website.\n\n547\n00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.860\nIf I can't attack your website, and deface\nit, and put my pretty picture up on your\n\n548\n00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:36.340\nmain page, or Mickey Mouse or whatever,\nthen I'll just break it down.\n\n549\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.280\nI'll make sure that nobody can go to your\nwebsite, that's a denial-of-service.\n\n550\n00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.020\nAlso, you can have what's called\na distributed denial-of-service attack.\n\n551\n00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.990\nSame thing except now,\na denial-of-service,\n\n552\n00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.090\nthe attack is usually\ncoming from one machine.\n\n553\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.810\nDistributed means I'm gonna have\na botnet or a zombie farm or\n\n554\n00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.220\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n555\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.270\nI'm gonna have multiple machines,\nI'm gonna distribute the attack.\n\n556\n00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.100\nBecause a lot of times, if I'm gonna\ndo a DoS, a denial-of-service,\n\n557\n00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.200\nthat means I wanna try to consume all\nthe resources on that web server so\n\n558\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.310\nthat it can't do its normal job and\nrespond to requests.\n\n559\n00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.710\nWell, that means I need more\nresources than the web server.\n\n560\n00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.510\nBecause if I'm trying to suck\nup all its resources, but\n\n561\n00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.130\nit has more resources\nthan I have available,\n\n562\n00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.100\nI'm gonna run out of bandwidth for\nexample, before the web server does.\n\n563\n00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.510\nSo my denial-of-service is not gonna work.\n\n564\n00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.550\nBut if I can take a 100 or a 1,000 or\n10,000 machines, and have them\n\n565\n00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:32.560\nall attack that web server at once, now I\nhave more resources than the web server.\n\n566\n00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.440\nAnd hopefully I'm gonna win this battle,\ncome out on top, and the web server's\n\n567\n00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.750\ngonna choke and it's not gonna be able\nto respond to legitimate requests.\n\n568\n00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.340\nFor this exam, again, denial-of-service,\nyou're consuming resources so\n\n569\n00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.510\nthat the service cannot\ndo its normal function.\n\n570\n00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.260\nIn the case of a web server,\nits normal function is to serve web pages.\n\n571\n00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.000\nSomebody sends a GET request and\nit should respond with that web page.\n\n572\n00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.610\nI'm gonna make it so\nbusy that it cannot respond,\n\n573\n00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.879\nbecause it just doesn't\nhave the resources.\n\n574\n00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.308\nEvalation, did I type that?\n\n575\n00:31:02.308 --> 00:31:03.297\n&gt;&gt; Elevation.\n\n576\n00:31:03.297 --> 00:31:04.394\n&gt;&gt; Elevation, okay, I was gonna say.\n\n577\n00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:08.197\n&gt;&gt; And that's weird because sometimes you\nhave here elevation of privilege, but\n\n578\n00:31:08.197 --> 00:31:11.490\nI've also read sometimes people\nwill say privilege escalation.\n\n579\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.780\nSo just kinda be aware\nof both of those terms.\n\n580\n00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, either one will work, right?\n\n581\n00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n582\n00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:17.063\n&gt;&gt; It's just saying hey,\n\n583\n00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:19.900\nlook, here's what I've got right now,\nI'm allowed to do this and this.\n\n584\n00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.961\nBut I wanna get to the point where I\ncan do this, this, and this, right?\n\n585\n00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:27.426\nI can do A as the current user,\nbut I wanna be able to do B and\n\n586\n00:31:27.426 --> 00:31:30.170\nthat's gonna take more credentials.\n\n587\n00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.740\nSo I might compromise an account\nthat has normal user access.\n\n588\n00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.270\nSo I got a user name and password through\nwhatever nefarious means I've used.\n\n589\n00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.504\nAnd I get logged in and realize, I don't\nhave any administrative rights, it's okay.\n\n590\n00:31:43.504 --> 00:31:47.712\nI'm in the door now, my next task\nis to escalate my credentials or\n\n591\n00:31:47.712 --> 00:31:52.456\nelevate my credentials, as they say here,\nand that just means, again,\n\n592\n00:31:52.456 --> 00:31:57.604\ntrying to move up to an account that has\nmore credentials than the one I've got.\n\n593\n00:31:57.604 --> 00:32:02.206\nDefense-wise for web servers, well,\nYou've got IDSs and IPSs, we've talked\n\n594\n00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:06.690\nabout those already, intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n595\n00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.530\nI know we'll talk about more about\nthem in an upcoming episode.\n\n596\n00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:16.420\nWireless application firewalls,\nwe talked about those as well.\n\n597\n00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.375\nCherokee we're almost done,\nI know we're running out of time here.\n\n598\n00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:23.104\nThe last topic I wanna talk\nabout is wireless security, and\n\n599\n00:32:23.104 --> 00:32:26.100\nI know everybody's heard\nthe horror stories.\n\n600\n00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:32.479\nThey think wireless, they think insecure,\nand not really true but somewhat.\n\n601\n00:32:32.479 --> 00:32:35.930\nI mean we know why people think that.\n\n602\n00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.150\nWhen it comes to risks for\nwireless security,\n\n603\n00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.210\nthe biggest one, it's one Cherokee\nmentioned earlier, misconfiguration.\n\n604\n00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.340\nI know we were talking about,\nI think, VPNs then,\n\n605\n00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.780\nbut same thing goes in your\nwireless access points.\n\n606\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.590\nJust misconfiguring them,\nnot choosing the right protocol,\n\n607\n00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:53.140\nor not enabling security at all\non your wireless access point,\n\n608\n00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.600\nleaving it open is just asking for\nsomebody to take over your network.\n\n609\n00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.960\nSo misconfiguration, big problem.\n\n610\n00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.005\nPhysical boundaries can be a problem\nas well, because it's an unbound media,\n\n611\n00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:09.595\nI set an access point right here,\nand I'm in the middle of our office.\n\n612\n00:33:09.595 --> 00:33:12.668\nAnd I think, okay, now everybody\nin the office will have wireless.\n\n613\n00:33:12.668 --> 00:33:14.935\nBut how far does that signal go, right?\n\n614\n00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:18.742\nIt doesn't know that my office\nstops at this wall here.\n\n615\n00:33:18.742 --> 00:33:23.850\nIt goes until it attenuates so far that\nyou can't pick up the signal anymore,\n\n616\n00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.720\nwhich is typically well beyond\nwhat they'll rate it for.\n\n617\n00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.689\nSo what I'm trying to say here is,\nyou have to keep in\n\n618\n00:33:30.689 --> 00:33:34.944\nmind that there's no physical boundary,\nI say that and I know some of you.\n\n619\n00:33:34.944 --> 00:33:36.185\n&gt;&gt; You can adjust your power settings.\n\n620\n00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:39.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah some-\n&gt;&gt; If it's bleeding into your neighbors\n\n621\n00:33:39.437 --> 00:33:40.878\nrent space there.\n\n622\n00:33:40.878 --> 00:33:44.125\n&gt;&gt; You know it's a common, it's actually\none of the things we were gonna talk about\n\n623\n00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:46.130\nwith misconceptions because you.\n\n624\n00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.955\nHonestly I would tell you that\nyou shouldn't play with those.\n\n625\n00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Placement is more key there.\n\n626\n00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, placement is a better thing.\n\n627\n00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.160\nThe problem with changing the power,\n\n628\n00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.660\nif you up the power cuz you\nthink I want more signal.\n\n629\n00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.459\nThese devices are usually already\ntowards their limit as far as what\n\n630\n00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:01.465\nthey can handle.\n\n631\n00:34:01.465 --> 00:34:06.280\nRemember, more power means heat, you're\ngonna end up burning the device out.\n\n632\n00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.980\nAnd your gain on how far the signal\ngoes isn't going to be that great.\n\n633\n00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.180\nWe're really talking about\nfine tuning the power.\n\n634\n00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:17.360\nDropping it down a little bit\nas well with raising it up,\n\n635\n00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.240\nyou can actually cause your access\npoint to start dropping packets.\n\n636\n00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.390\nAnd you end up hurting performance.\n\n637\n00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:26.324\nSame thing, dropping it down\ncan definitely drop it down.\n\n638\n00:34:26.324 --> 00:34:31.796\nBut you drop it down too much, and all of\na sudden your coverage is not the same.\n\n639\n00:34:31.796 --> 00:34:35.524\n&gt;&gt; So it's better to just pre plan, and\ngo around, perform a site survey, and\n\n640\n00:34:35.524 --> 00:34:36.937\nthen choose your location.\n\n641\n00:34:36.937 --> 00:34:40.327\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the site surveys,\nlooking at where your coverage is and\n\n642\n00:34:40.327 --> 00:34:41.815\nadjusting your placement.\n\n643\n00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:44.340\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Adding more is gonna be a better bet\n\n644\n00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.010\nfor controlling that.\n\n645\n00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.840\nAnd why are we worried about it?\n\n646\n00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.630\nBecause I don't really want my signal\ngoing out into the parking lot too far,\n\n647\n00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.780\nwhere somebody can sit out there and\n\n648\n00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.220\nattack my network without\nme knowing about it.\n\n649\n00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.654\nOr reaching into the office next to me,\nand them using all my bandwidth cuz they\n\n650\n00:34:58.654 --> 00:35:01.970\ndon't wanna pay for their own\nwireless access point and network.\n\n651\n00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.160\nSo we wanna control that.\n\n652\n00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.600\nPhysical security as well,\nif I can touch your wireless access point,\n\n653\n00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.110\nit's no longer your wireless access point,\nright?\n\n654\n00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:14.150\nI can reset it at the bare minimum,\nI can hold the button down and\n\n655\n00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.620\nblow away a lot of your configurations.\n\n656\n00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.571\nDepending on the access point, I know.\n\n657\n00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:18.000\n&gt;&gt; Vandalize it, sure.\n\n658\n00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just do a denial of\nservice on it by unplugging it.\n\n659\n00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:24.400\nPhysical security trumps everything else.\n\n660\n00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.438\nRogue access points, this is when,\n\n661\n00:35:26.438 --> 00:35:30.470\nCherokee I have told you we don't\ndo wireless here, it's not allowed.\n\n662\n00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.180\nAnd she's like,\nI've got to have my laptop on wireless, so\n\n663\n00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.270\nshe brings in an access point and\nplugs it under her desk.\n\n664\n00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.219\nAnd now she's got wireless, and\nshe can spin around in her chair and\n\n665\n00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:40.531\nnot get tangled in the wires.\n\n666\n00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:43.837\nBut the problem is,\nis she's not a security person.\n\n667\n00:35:43.837 --> 00:35:47.187\nHypothetically, I know you are,\nI shouldn't use you as an example.\n\n668\n00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:53.684\nBut now the wireless access point\nbasically in it's default configuration,\n\n669\n00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:59.699\nit's got no policies on it, it's just\na big gaping hole in my security.\n\n670\n00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.796\nIt's not gonna be monitored, yeah you've\ngotta monitor your wireless traffic,\n\n671\n00:36:02.796 --> 00:36:05.810\nyou've got to see what's going on,\nsee who's connecting.\n\n672\n00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:10.400\nWeak encryption methods, we know WEP,\nfor example, Wired Equivalent Privacy,\n\n673\n00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.250\nis horribly weak at this day and age.\n\n674\n00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.300\nWe've got too much processing power,\nthat's just not strong enough.\n\n675\n00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.530\nOff hours is another one\nwe have to deal with.\n\n676\n00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.820\nSome organizations turn their\naccess points off at night,\n\n677\n00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.010\nbecause I don't need\nanybody being able to,\n\n678\n00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.152\nthey can't get in, I've got the doors\nall locked, the alarm system's set.\n\n679\n00:36:32.152 --> 00:36:34.151\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; We've got crazy Dobermans running\n\n680\n00:36:34.151 --> 00:36:35.003\naround inside.\n\n681\n00:36:35.003 --> 00:36:36.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you do get in you're\n\n682\n00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.997\ngonna get eaten, right?\n\n683\n00:36:36.997 --> 00:36:39.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to, you're sitting\n\n684\n00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:43.309\nout in the parking lot in the comfort of\nyour car, hitting my wireless network, and\n\n685\n00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:45.853\nattempting to break in and\nget in and do whatever you want.\n\n686\n00:36:45.853 --> 00:36:46.427\nSo yes,\n\n687\n00:36:46.427 --> 00:36:51.944\nsome companies will power down their\nwireless access points during off hours.\n\n688\n00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:54.074\nWar driving,\nyeah I know you've heard that term,\n\n689\n00:36:54.074 --> 00:36:58.080\nthat's just driving around looking for\naccess points that I can try to attack.\n\n690\n00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.250\nEavesdropping, man in the middle attack.\n\n691\n00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.820\nThese are a lot easier\non wireless networks,\n\n692\n00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.960\nbecause they don't have to get in between\nyou somehow in that conversation.\n\n693\n00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.380\nOn a wired network, I've gotta somehow\nget in between you and the other end.\n\n694\n00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.550\nUnbound media, however, it's just\nfloating out in space, if you will.\n\n695\n00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.440\nSo I can sit there and I can intercept\nthose packets on their way to\n\n696\n00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.329\nthe access point, and\nI can try to do man in the middle attacks.\n\n697\n00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.073\nLast thing I wanna talk\nabout with wireless,\n\n698\n00:37:23.073 --> 00:37:26.770\nthe misconceptions that\nthey talk about here.\n\n699\n00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.458\nDisabling the SSID broadcast,\n\n700\n00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:32.155\nthere's a few things people always\nsay to do to secure your networks.\n\n701\n00:37:32.155 --> 00:37:35.680\nDisable the SSID broadcast,\nuse your Mac filtering.\n\n702\n00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.860\nAll right, let's just make sure we\nunderstand what those accomplish so\n\n703\n00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.900\nthat you understand what\nthe security benefit is.\n\n704\n00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.573\n&gt;&gt; And what they do not accomplish.\n\n705\n00:37:42.573 --> 00:37:43.771\n&gt;&gt; And what they don't do exactly.\n\n706\n00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:44.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n707\n00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.559\n&gt;&gt; Because, on their own,\n\n708\n00:37:46.559 --> 00:37:49.250\nthey're not gonna help you that much.\n\n709\n00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.895\nCombined with other methods,\nthey're definitely worth doing.\n\n710\n00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:57.012\nAnd if you disable the SSID broadcast,\nSSID Security Set Identifier,\n\n711\n00:37:57.012 --> 00:37:59.040\nthis is what shows up in your list.\n\n712\n00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.890\nWhen you open up your phone and you see\nall those wireless networks in the area,\n\n713\n00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.360\nthat's because the access\npoints do beaconing.\n\n714\n00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.085\nThey broadcast out information about\nthemselves, including their name,\n\n715\n00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:12.994\ntheir SSID, what channel, what their\nsecurity method is, things like that.\n\n716\n00:38:12.994 --> 00:38:17.248\nYour devices, your laptop, your phones,\nwhat have you, pick that information up,\n\n717\n00:38:17.248 --> 00:38:20.060\nshow you a list,\nyou click on it, you connect.\n\n718\n00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.060\nAssuming you know the password,\ndepending on the security configuration.\n\n719\n00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.940\n&gt;&gt; And it's not illegal to go ahead and\n\n720\n00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.950\nsniff those management frames\nwhich are in cleartext.\n\n721\n00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.665\nSo if someone gets that SSID,\nthen they have that information.\n\n722\n00:38:31.665 --> 00:38:34.505\nNow I can go ahead and\ncraft the packet to make it seem as\n\n723\n00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:36.895\nthis is a legitimate access point,\nlike an evil twin.\n\n724\n00:38:36.895 --> 00:38:38.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n725\n00:38:38.031 --> 00:38:39.005\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n726\n00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:39.555\nPeople think, well,\n\n727\n00:38:39.555 --> 00:38:43.915\nif I disable the broadcast of the SSID,\nnobody's gonna find my access point.\n\n728\n00:38:45.155 --> 00:38:46.085\nYes and no, right,\n\n729\n00:38:46.085 --> 00:38:49.810\nit's not gonna show up in my list,\nbecause it's not beaconing anymore.\n\n730\n00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.230\nBut all I have to do is wait for\n\n731\n00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.730\na legitimate user to connect\nto your access point.\n\n732\n00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.560\nNow there's traffic going back and forth\nbetween somebody that knew the name and\n\n733\n00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.470\nwas able to connect to it,\nthere's traffic going back and forth.\n\n734\n00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.020\nIn the header of the packet, unencrypted,\nno matter what encryption level you choose\n\n735\n00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.380\nfor your wireless traffic,\nin the header is the SSID.\n\n736\n00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.570\nSo I'm gonna get the SSID,\nit's just a matter of time.\n\n737\n00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.400\nThe disabling of it actually\nmakes it more difficult for\n\n738\n00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.350\nyour legitimate users to connect.\n\n739\n00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:20.037\nIt causes other issues, too,\nif we had more time, I could tell\n\n740\n00:39:20.037 --> 00:39:24.853\nyou how it actually ends up forcing your\nclients to do almost a reverse beaconing.\n\n741\n00:39:24.853 --> 00:39:27.988\nAnd they're always looking for\nthe network, so it helps, but\n\n742\n00:39:27.988 --> 00:39:30.550\nI don't think it's\nthe end all in security.\n\n743\n00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.480\nMAC filtering, same thing,\npain in the butt.\n\n744\n00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.890\n&gt;&gt; More administrative work.\n\n745\n00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n746\n00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.822\n&gt;&gt; Trying to administer that,\n\n747\n00:39:35.822 --> 00:39:39.028\nmaking sure that every time you get\na new device, you get the MAC address,\n\n748\n00:39:39.028 --> 00:39:40.500\nand you put it on that list.\n\n749\n00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.313\nIn a high secure environment, where I'm\ngonna control who's allowed to connect to\n\n750\n00:39:45.313 --> 00:39:47.911\nthis, yeah, it's probably a good method.\n\n751\n00:39:47.911 --> 00:39:51.666\nBut in a network where devices change,\npeople are bringing their phones,\n\n752\n00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:54.330\ntheir iPads, their laptops, their tablets.\n\n753\n00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.629\nAnd they all expect to connect?\n\n754\n00:39:55.629 --> 00:39:58.749\nI can't imagine trying to manage\nthat mac Filtering a list.\n\n755\n00:39:58.749 --> 00:40:00.614\nAnd guess what?\n\n756\n00:40:00.614 --> 00:40:04.597\nGuess what's in the header of the packet\nthat's not encrypted no matter what\n\n757\n00:40:04.597 --> 00:40:05.980\nyou choose?\n\n758\n00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.020\nThe MAC address.\n\n759\n00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.640\nSo let's say you're doing\nMAC address filtering.\n\n760\n00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.800\nWell Cherokee, I know,\nis allowed to connect to the access point.\n\n761\n00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.090\nSo I'm gonna wait until she\nmakes a wireless connection.\n\n762\n00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.640\nI'm gonna sniff that traffic.\n\n763\n00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.210\nIn the header is Cherokee's MAC address.\n\n764\n00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.170\nNow I'm gonna change my MAC address\nto the same, and guess what?\n\n765\n00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.250\nI'm now Cherokee as far as the wireless\naccess point is concerned.\n\n766\n00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:30.820\nOr at least my MAC address is now on the\nlist of approved or allowed connections.\n\n767\n00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.620\nAnd I'm gonna connect.\n\n768\n00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.420\nSo understand that those can be combined\nwith other methods to provide security.\n\n769\n00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.690\nBut just doing, disabling\nthe broadcast of the SSID on it's own?\n\n770\n00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.120\nThat's not gonna provide\nyou any security there.\n\n771\n00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.470\nAlso, two last things.\n\n772\n00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.000\nThe Bluetooth,\n\n773\n00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.170\nI know another big misconception is\nthat if my Bluetooth is turned off.\n\n774\n00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.520\nOr it's not set to be discoverable,\nnobody can find my device.\n\n775\n00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.486\nNot true, right?\n\n776\n00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:59.214\nRemember, Bluetooth is just another,\nit's 2.4ghz, it's wireless RF,\n\n777\n00:40:59.214 --> 00:41:01.810\njust like what we use with our laptops.\n\n778\n00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:02.930\nI know it's called Bluetooth, and\n\n779\n00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.070\neverybody thinks it's\na completely different thing.\n\n780\n00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.330\nIt's radio frequency, it's the same thing.\n\n781\n00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.250\nSo those packets are unbound media,\nall of the same thing.\n\n782\n00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:15.480\nBut the interesting thing\nabout the undiscoverables,\n\n783\n00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.940\nis that there are ways to get devices\nto give up their information.\n\n784\n00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.890\nEven if they're not turned\non as discoverable.\n\n785\n00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.450\nBecause it'll give you part of\nthe information, and then hide the rest.\n\n786\n00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.020\nBut there's so few,\nyou can go through all the OIDs for\n\n787\n00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.940\nBluetooth devices in a matter of minutes.\n\n788\n00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.300\nAnd I can force all those devices to\nsend back their information to me.\n\n789\n00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.330\nAnd now I know they're out there.\n\n790\n00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.290\nAnd Bluetooth is not short-range.\n\n791\n00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.260\nI mean, people say it's short-range only.\n\n792\n00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.934\nYes, Bluetooth Class 3, right?\n\n793\n00:41:44.934 --> 00:41:46.340\nI think it goes backwards.\n\n794\n00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:53.634\nClass 3 Bluetooth radio's 10 feet,\nClass 2 30 feet, Class 1.\n\n795\n00:41:53.634 --> 00:41:56.121\nNow I've put myself in the spot.\n\n796\n00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:59.150\n100 meters?\n\n797\n00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.230\nIt's pretty lengthy, it's a good distance.\n\n798\n00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.530\nAnd then we can turn around, and\n\n799\n00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:06.370\nwe can hook these Bluetooth\ndongles to an external antenna.\n\n800\n00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.173\nAnd now I can pick up your\nBluetooth signal for a mile.\n\n801\n00:42:08.173 --> 00:42:12.015\nI mean, so don't get under that\nconception, or that misconception,\n\n802\n00:42:12.015 --> 00:42:14.210\nthat Bluetooth stays right here.\n\n803\n00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.390\nAnd unless you're within three feet of me,\nyou're not going to be able to do it.\n\n804\n00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.830\nWhy are we worried about that?\n\n805\n00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.140\nThings like Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking.\n\n806\n00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.880\nWhere I can try to connect to your device\nand make your device give up information.\n\n807\n00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.870\nGo through your contacts,\ngo through your calendars-\n\n808\n00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.110\n&gt;&gt; SMS messages.\n\n809\n00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:29.930\nAll of the good stuff.\n\n810\n00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.360\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so Bluetooth,\n\n811\n00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.290\nwe have to take Bluetooth security\ninto consideration as well.\n\n812\n00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.600\nAnd I promise I'll stop there.\n\n813\n00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.480\nI could go on and\non about wireless security.\n\n814\n00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.220\nBut for the exam, I think this is\nprobably what we need to focus on.\n\n815\n00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you've delivered on\nyour promise there of your high level\n\n816\n00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.280\nnetwork security.\n\n817\n00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.184\nSo thank you for that, Mike.\n\n818\n00:42:48.184 --> 00:42:50.610\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in today.\n\n819\n00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.370\nBut that's it for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n820\n00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.760\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n821\n00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n822\n00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.289\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n823\n00:42:57.289 --> 00:43:04.870\n[MUSIC]\n\n824\n00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.830\n&gt;&gt;

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.000\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essential Series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.040\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.030\nIn this episode we'll be looking\nat vulnerability scanning.\n\n6\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.120\nAnd with us today we have Mr. Mike Rodrick\nin studios to help us with this topic.\n\n7\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.462\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n8\n00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:29.001\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for\nhaving me Cherokee, glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.990\nVulnerability scanning, right.\n\n10\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.440\nYou know when it comes to, well I'm trying\nto think of a good way to start this out.\n\n11\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.218\nI guess first we should probably define,\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n12\n00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:44.063\nAnd when we're talking about vulnerability\nscanning we're talking about\n\n13\n00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:48.373\ntaking a machine, a web server,\na client, it could be anything and\n\n14\n00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:52.040\nscanning it looking for\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n15\n00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.639\nMuch the same way we do antivirus\nwith the old definitions based,\n\n16\n00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.332\nthat's what these\nvulnerability scanners do.\n\n17\n00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:02.778\nThey have database full of known\nvulnerabilities and they're gonna scan\n\n18\n00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:07.224\nyour system and they're gonna compare\nagainst that database looking for\n\n19\n00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:09.340\nthose known vulnerabilities.\n\n20\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.860\nAnd then they're gonna report back to you\nwhat vulnerabilities they've found and\n\n21\n00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240\nwe use this to find those\nvulnerabilities before the bad guys do.\n\n22\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.410\nThat's the idea anyway, I want to scan my\nmachines, look for vulnerabilities and\n\n23\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.760\nthen patch them, maybe,\nI guess we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n24\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.950\nPatch them up so\nthat other people can't find them.\n\n25\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.330\nAnd take advantage of them.\n\n26\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.570\nBecause known vulnerabilities,\nmost of them have\n\n27\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.480\nexploits written that can take\nadvantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n28\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.240\nSo if somebody finds a vulnerability,\nlet's say your web server is vulnerable to\n\n29\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.400\nsuch and such buffer overflow,\nthen they can go get the exploit,\n\n30\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.090\nthere's probably one already written or\nthey can write their own.\n\n31\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.150\nThat'll take advantage of that buffer\noverflow, they know exactly how much data\n\n32\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.690\nto send, where to inject their commands so\nthat their command can get executed.\n\n33\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.420\nAnd if there's an exploit written for\nit already, it's usually a matter of just\n\n34\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.670\ntweaking a little bit and\nthen executing it against that machine.\n\n35\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.653\nSo the idea is we wanna look at our\nsystems, find the vulnerabilities so\n\n36\n00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:13.071\nthat we can do something about it.\n\n37\n00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:17.339\nAll right, now when we look at\nvulnerability management and\n\n38\n00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.686\nwe're talking about a whole system,\na cycle, or a process or\n\n39\n00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:26.893\nset of procedures that we're gonna\ngo through to manage vulnerability.\n\n40\n00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:32.550\nVulnerability scanning would be just one\nstep In that said cycle or procedure.\n\n41\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.299\nSo when we talk about over, over, man!\n\n42\n00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.720\nI am having trouble talking today.\n\n43\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.950\nVulnerability management, there we go,\nI got it out of my mouth.\n\n44\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.970\nThere's a few steps that\nwe wanna talk about.\n\n45\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.630\nIdentifying your assets, categorizing\nyour assets, scanning your assets,\n\n46\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.460\nanalyzing or ranking your risk, patch\nmanagement, and then post-scan, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.950\nAnd let's take each one of\nthose a step at a time here.\n\n48\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.290\nSo first thing you have to\ndo is identify your assets.\n\n49\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.083\nMake sense, right?\n\n50\n00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.420\nI need to know what I have out there.\n\n51\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.590\nIf there's servers that I don't know\nI have, then I'm not monitoring them,\n\n52\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.400\nI'm not managing them, I'm not taking\ncare of them I'm not protecting them.\n\n53\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.860\nSo in order to do\nvulnerability management,\n\n54\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.220\nthe first thing we really need\nto do is get a good inventory.\n\n55\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.630\nNow, that might be done manually or\nsome type of application.\n\n56\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.618\n&gt;&gt; Risk analysis?\n\n57\n00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, like some type of network\nscanner that goes out and finds all\n\n58\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.640\nthe different devices that respond, or\ntypically a combination of the two.\n\n59\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.380\nThere's several network mappers,\nSolarWinds,\n\n60\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.870\nthere's several others out there that make\nnetwork Scanners that are looking for\n\n61\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.490\nnodes on your network that\ncan help you map things out.\n\n62\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.970\nFinding all your end points,\nfinding all your routers,\n\n63\n00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.444\nbasically giving an idea what you have.\n\n64\n00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:52.920\nAnd if this is not part of your network\ndocumentation already, shame on you.\n\n65\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.320\nYou really should know what\ndevices are supposed to be there.\n\n66\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.210\nBecause if you don't know\nwhat's supposed to be there,\n\n67\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.460\nthen you can't tell me\nwhat shouldn't be there.\n\n68\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.024\nAll right or\nat least it makes it very difficult.\n\n69\n00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:07.660\nSo it's almost like a baseline if\nyou will for your network devices.\n\n70\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.250\nYou've gotta know what's there.\n\n71\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.710\nSo once I've identified all of my assets,\nI know that we've got 25 servers,\n\n72\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.387\nwe've got 1,000 clients,\nwe've got five access points.\n\n73\n00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:18.736\nWe've got a couple of routers, firewall.\n\n74\n00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:23.370\nOnce I get that down, then we're\ngonna start categorizing our assets.\n\n75\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.530\nBecause different assets have different\nsensitivity levels if you will or\n\n76\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.480\nneeds for security or different\nsecurity levels would be a good thing.\n\n77\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.045\nWe protect routers differently\nthan we protect our web servers,\n\n78\n00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.370\ndifferent tools, different methods for\nprotecting those.\n\n79\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.154\nMy laptops that we give to\nour salespeople to travel\n\n80\n00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:49.970\nwhen they go on their\ndrives are data-sensitive.\n\n81\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.308\nThey don't keep anything on them.\n\n82\n00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:55.282\nMaybe they're re-imaged once a week and\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n83\n00:04:55.282 --> 00:04:56.395\nAll this stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:59.281\nAll data's stored on\na centralized file servers or\n\n85\n00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.150\ncloud services so there's no data on them.\n\n86\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.070\nSo maybe they're not quite as critical or\nas sensitive as my SQL Servers,\n\n87\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.080\nmy web backends and things like that.\n\n88\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.940\nSo we kinda have to categorize\nour assets based on how\n\n89\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.090\nthey need to be protected or\nwhat level of protection they need.\n\n90\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.590\nCritical or non-critical, then, once we've\ncategorized them, we can start scanning.\n\n91\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.207\nAnd the scanning is, you know,\nthe part they're talking about here.\n\n92\n00:05:28.207 --> 00:05:29.760\nYou know, the vulnerability scan.\n\n93\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.765\nNow you're using, typically,\nsome type of tool to do a scan.\n\n94\n00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:34.710\nThere's several out there.\n\n95\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.855\nSome free, some of them are paid.\n\n96\n00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:39.953\nYou have things like Open Box,\n\n97\n00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:44.630\nwhich is a an open source vulnerability\nscanner that you can run.\n\n98\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.345\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer Is\na vulnerability scanner for\n\n99\n00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:50.200\nWindows-based systems.\n\n100\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.270\nOpenVAS would do both Windows,\nand Linux, and other OSes.\n\n101\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.000\nNessus is another big one,\n\n102\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.770\nTenable Security makes a product\ncalled Nessus, N-E-S-S-U-S.\n\n103\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.270\nAnd it's a very common or\nvery popular vulnerability scanner.\n\n104\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.980\nBut you pay for that one,\nthat's one that you have to license.\n\n105\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.350\nIs one better than the other?\n\n106\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.290\nWell, yes, a lot of times you get what you\npay for but a lot of times what you're\n\n107\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.800\nlooking at in the paid versions is more\nthan just the scanner engine right?\n\n108\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.446\nWhereas open vas is a nice scanning\nengine, Nessus makes beautiful reports and\n\n109\n00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:28.021\npie charts and clickable links, things\nthat I could turn in as a deliverable if\n\n110\n00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:32.490\nI was doing a penetration test which\nwe're going to talk about a little bit.\n\n111\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.169\nYou know, that differentiates\nit from some of those other\n\n112\n00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.420\nfree ones that you might\nget that can't do that.\n\n113\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.097\nI'm gonna have to do something\nelse to generate my own report.\n\n114\n00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.507\n&gt;&gt; You're just getting that raw data.\n\n115\n00:06:40.507 --> 00:06:41.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n116\n00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:42.702\nsometimes it can be difficult to read.\n\n117\n00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:43.871\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n118\n00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:47.840\nAnd your C-level people don't like\nlooking at numbers and stuff like that.\n\n119\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.270\nThey wanna see pretty pie charts.\n\n120\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it makes it easier.\n\n121\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.950\nIf I'm going in there and asking for\nmoney, If I've got a pie chart and\n\n122\n00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.440\na big chunk of that pie is vulnerable\nto such and such, I could say, look,\n\n123\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.160\nif we spend this money we can\neliminate these vulnerabilities.\n\n124\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.133\nTakes a big chunk out and it's gonna be\na much easier sell than if I just go In\n\n125\n00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:10.604\nthere with a text based output from one\nof these lesser vulnerability scanners.\n\n126\n00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:13.972\nSo I don't wanna say that paid are better\nthan free or free are better than paid or\n\n127\n00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:14.890\nanything like that.\n\n128\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.440\nBut just understand that when\nyou're searching for one of these,\n\n129\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.420\nyes, you're gonna base it on\nprice depending on your budget.\n\n130\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.947\nBut you're also looking at\nwhat are the features and\n\n131\n00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:24.678\nsupport that they give you as well.\n\n132\n00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:29.641\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, would we classified\nthese as a form of a passive technique\n\n133\n00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:35.040\nbecause when that output comes to us,\nand depending on who we present it to.\n\n134\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.656\nUsually we do have a decision maker\nto go ahead and get approval for\n\n135\n00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:41.430\nthat purchase to help improve such and\nsuch.\n\n136\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.920\nBut that's gonna be something\nthat we do manually.\n\n137\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.088\nIt's not that this piece of software\nsees that vulnerability and\n\n138\n00:07:47.088 --> 00:07:50.502\nthen takes some kind of action to\ncorrect it, so this is more passive.\n\n139\n00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.750\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's definitely something\nwhere you're gonna get the report back.\n\n140\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.090\nAnd then you're gonna take it through our\nnext step and decide what is you wanna do.\n\n141\n00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.835\nA lot of them though, like Nessus.\n\n142\n00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:03.822\nAnd let me see, before you pull up my\nscreen, let me flip over and yeah,\n\n143\n00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:07.012\ngo ahead and\npull up my screen This is an example of\n\n144\n00:08:07.012 --> 00:08:09.735\nyou can download a trial\nversion from Teneble and\n\n145\n00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:13.860\ntry their product out to see if\nit's what you want on your network.\n\n146\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.130\nAnd again in this exam we're not trying\nto sell anyone a particular product or\n\n147\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.660\nanything like that, but because most\nvulnerability scanners are similar.\n\n148\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.681\nYou know one, you kinda know.\n\n149\n00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:25.962\nAnd we wanna learn the basic\nfunctionality, but here's an example.\n\n150\n00:08:25.962 --> 00:08:27.195\nLike I said, I ran this a while ago.\n\n151\n00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:30.990\nI think my trial's actually ended but\nI can still see my report.\n\n152\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.820\nAnd so I clicked on scans and\nI clicked on the name of own of my hosts.\n\n153\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.094\nAnd let me zoom in a little bit for\nyou a little bit there.\n\n154\n00:08:36.094 --> 00:08:40.250\nI can see, there's my host ten,\nzero, 100, 200.\n\n155\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.910\nThen I've got this pretty little bar\nthat's showing me my vulnerabilities.\n\n156\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.601\nIf I zoom back out so I can actually click\non our hover, if I hover over the 5,\n\n157\n00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:49.645\ntells me I've got medium, there's 5.\n\n158\n00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:55.138\nI got 1 low and 57 infos, and\nit doesn't look like any high.\n\n159\n00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:56.561\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n160\n00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:57.310\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing, right?\n\n161\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a relatively new 2016 install\n\n162\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.050\nwith all it's patches, so\nthere's not a lot just yet.\n\n163\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.190\nBut then I can click on this medium.\n\n164\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.020\nAnd it takes me over to this report here,\nI can see.\n\n165\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.336\nDNS server cache snooping,\nlet me zoom in for you,\n\n166\n00:09:11.336 --> 00:09:15.282\nDNS server cache snooping\nremote information disclosure.\n\n167\n00:09:15.282 --> 00:09:17.040\nWell, that doesn't sound good.\n\n168\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.000\nAnd it's listing it as medium.\n\n169\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.935\nSo now what I can do is click on this,\nand it's going to take me,\n\n170\n00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:25.140\nwhere it's going to give me a description,\ntells me what the problem is.\n\n171\n00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.420\nWhy did my server match\nthis vulnerability?\n\n172\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.650\nDown below, what can I do about it?\n\n173\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:36.143\nContact the vendor of the DNS software for\na fix is their solution so\n\n174\n00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:40.470\nin this case it's gonna be\nme talking to the vendor.\n\n175\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.590\nLet's see if I can find another one here,\ncertificate cannot be trusted, purchase or\n\n176\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.010\ngenerate a proper certificate for\n\n177\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.802\nthis service so\ngetting back to Cherokee's question there.\n\n178\n00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:54.274\nThey're not gonna fix them for you,\nbut the good ones will tell you\n\n179\n00:09:54.274 --> 00:09:57.630\nwhat your mitigation step might be,\nwhich is definitely nice.\n\n180\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.894\nIf not, if I'm using one of those ones\nthat doesn't give me this information,\n\n181\n00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:03.150\nwell at least I've got\nthe name of the vulnerability.\n\n182\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.000\nI can now go out and\nlook it up and do my research and\n\n183\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.160\nfind out what the vulnerability includes,\nand how I can prevent or\n\n184\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.510\nat least try to mitigate\nsome of that risk.\n\n185\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.430\nSo having a good vulnerability scanner,\nvery important.\n\n186\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.866\nIt's also important that we\nrun these scans often, right.\n\n187\n00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:22.705\nAnd I'm not talking every hour maybe,\nbut you run them,\n\n188\n00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.810\nit's not something that we run once.\n\n189\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.410\nWe run them and\nthen we go through our steps and\n\n190\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.350\nthen we run them again periodically.\n\n191\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.000\nWe install new software.\n\n192\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.050\nConfigurations change.\n\n193\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.656\nPatches come out that aren't applied,\nnot to every machine maybe.\n\n194\n00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:41.326\nSo we wanna make sure we're doing this\non a regular basis as part of a process.\n\n195\n00:10:41.326 --> 00:10:44.254\nDon't do it once and then forget\nabout it and never run it again.\n\n196\n00:10:44.254 --> 00:10:45.790\nSo let's go back to our steps there.\n\n197\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.280\nIdentify your assets,\ncategorize your assets.\n\n198\n00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.655\nScan your assets, like we saw there.\n\n199\n00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:55.395\nAnd I didn't actually run the scan, but\nyou just tell it, here's the IP address or\n\n200\n00:10:55.395 --> 00:11:00.050\nthe IP address range that I want to scan,\nand it's going to do it's thing.\n\n201\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.600\nYou do want to make sure your\ndefinitions are up to date.\n\n202\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.310\nJust like antivirus software, these are\nbased on definitions, and it so you want\n\n203\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.991\nto make sure you're going out and getting\nthe latest and greatest definitions.\n\n204\n00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:12.442\nSo that I can scan my machines for those.\n\n205\n00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:16.333\nOnce we're done with the scan\nthen we rank our risk and\n\n206\n00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:21.270\nyou can see from tenable for\nexample tried to do that for me.\n\n207\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:26.190\nWe saw in the vulnerability report that\nI had several mediums, I had one low,\n\n208\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.476\nand then I had a few informational.\n\n209\n00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:32.697\nI didn't have any highs,\nbut that could have been\n\n210\n00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:37.800\na ranking there if I had one\nthat was a high level of risk.\n\n211\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.700\nSo, we want to categorize them.\n\n212\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.340\nAnd the reason we do this is because\nwe can't fix everything all at once.\n\n213\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.917\nWe have to have some way\nto prioritize our efforts.\n\n214\n00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:49.354\nWhere are we going to spend our time?\n\n215\n00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:50.975\nWhere are we going to spend our money?\n\n216\n00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:54.191\nWhat are we gonna get the most bang for\nyour buck, if you will.\n\n217\n00:11:54.191 --> 00:12:00.328\nAll right, we might see one risk\nthat has a relatively high impact.\n\n218\n00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:04.040\nIf somebody does takes advantage of this\nrisk, then this vulnerability that it's\n\n219\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.280\nfound, it could cause serious\nproblems in our organization.\n\n220\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.850\nBut the likelihood of that\noccurring is very low.\n\n221\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.020\nSo we end up making a risk\nmatrix where we have impact,\n\n222\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.120\nlow, medium, and high, for example.\n\n223\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.350\nAnd then we have likelihood,\nlow, medium, and high.\n\n224\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.420\nAnd so a risk with a low impact and\n\n225\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.170\nlow likelihood, we're probably gonna\nmove to the bottom of the list.\n\n226\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.610\nI'll deal with that,\nif ever, when I get to it.\n\n227\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.090\nBut those risks that\nhave a high impact and\n\n228\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.030\na high likelihood those\nare the ones I need to do first.\n\n229\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.170\nBecause if somebody basically I'm\nsaying if something happens and\n\n230\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.740\nsomebody finds this vulnerability and\ntakes advantage of it.\n\n231\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.990\nIt's going be a serious impact on our\norganization period that's going to mean\n\n232\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.410\nconfidential information is leaked out or\n\n233\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.080\nsomebody has access, we can face\nHIPAA fines whatever the case may be.\n\n234\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.980\nHigh impact and high likelihood.\n\n235\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.030\nIt's a vulnerability that is\neasy to take advantage of or\n\n236\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.760\nit's exposed to the Internet so\nthe odds of somebody finding it,\n\n237\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.440\nif it's on my web server\nfront end are high.\n\n238\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.180\nSo the likelihood of it occurring is high.\n\n239\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.120\nNow I've got a risk that's\nvery likely to happen.\n\n240\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.550\nAnd, if it does happen,\nit's gonna cost me a lot.\n\n241\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.879\nThat's where I want to start.\n\n242\n00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.000\nSo, that's what prioritizing\nrisk is all about.\n\n243\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.661\nAnd yeah, it goes into risk management,\nrisk assessment, and\n\n244\n00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:23.500\nthat's not what we're getting into here.\n\n245\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.990\nBut it is important to understand,\nit's part of doing vulnerability scans.\n\n246\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.440\nBecause you're gonna get a report back,\nlike you saw for mine,\n\n247\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.260\nthat's gonna have lots of\nvulnerabilities on there.\n\n248\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.630\nWhere do I start?\n\n249\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.740\nWell, the ones that have\nthe biggest impact and\n\n250\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.560\nare most likely to happen,\nthat's where you're gonna start.\n\n251\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.870\nAnd then you work your\nway down through those,\n\n252\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.270\ndepending on how your\norganization sees fit.\n\n253\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.982\nI'll keep going through those high impact,\nmedium likelihood and\n\n254\n00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:53.294\nthen, maybe I jump over to medium impact,\nhigh likelihood.\n\n255\n00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:56.239\nAnd eventually, I work my way down\nto low impact, low likelihood.\n\n256\n00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:58.680\nBecause again, you can't fix everything.\n\n257\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.670\nWe've got budgets that\nwe have to stay within.\n\n258\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.040\nWe've got man hours and things like that,\nthat we have to consider.\n\n259\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.087\nSo we wanna try to figure out the best\napproach, and that is starting\n\n260\n00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:12.848\nwith the riskiest, the highest impact,\nand working our way down, all right?\n\n261\n00:14:12.848 --> 00:14:16.187\nOnce we've ranked the risk,\nthen we do our patch management or\n\n262\n00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:19.715\nwhatever it is we need to fix those\nvulnerabilities that we found.\n\n263\n00:14:19.715 --> 00:14:22.896\nPatch management is\na conversation in of itself, but\n\n264\n00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:25.451\nwe've gotta keep our machines up to date.\n\n265\n00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:29.635\nI mean vendors put out patches\nwhen vulnerabilities get found,\n\n266\n00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.850\nthey typically get reported to the vendor.\n\n267\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.460\nNot always because bad guys find them and\nmaybe don't want to report them but\n\n268\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:42.370\nmost vendors have programs that do nothing\nbut look for vulnerabilities in a product.\n\n269\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:48.150\nA lot of them have bug tracker\nthat you can get involved with.\n\n270\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.580\nWhere, if I find a bug,\nI can report it to the organization,\n\n271\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.020\nthe software vendor, and they might even\nhave, they have bug bounty programs.\n\n272\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.390\nThey might even pay me.\n\n273\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.159\nIn fact, the one I read about-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Some of them\n\n274\n00:14:58.159 --> 00:14:58.857\nare getting pretty high.\n\n275\n00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.675\n[CROSSTALK] Microsoft, and\nwho was the other company.\n\n276\n00:15:01.675 --> 00:15:02.267\n&gt;&gt; A lot of them do.\n\n277\n00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.071\nA lot of the-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Well,\n\n278\n00:15:03.071 --> 00:15:04.088\nnow that Microsoft's acquired Facebook,\n\n279\n00:15:04.088 --> 00:15:05.248\nit might have been Facebook,\nI can't remember.\n\n280\n00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:05.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n281\n00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:07.727\nthere was one I was\nreading about last week,\n\n282\n00:15:07.727 --> 00:15:10.425\nwhere the person got paid $18,000 for\nturning the bug.\n\n283\n00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:11.831\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Some of\nthem are up to $1 million.\n\n284\n00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.117\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n285\n00:15:13.117 --> 00:15:16.045\nI mean, you could make a living\ndoing this if you were good at it.\n\n286\n00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:19.853\nI mean, there's a lot of effort\ninvolved in finding bugs.\n\n287\n00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.558\nBut yeah.\n\n288\n00:15:21.558 --> 00:15:25.474\nBut the point I wanted to make here,\nis that when vulnerabilities are found,\n\n289\n00:15:25.474 --> 00:15:29.148\neither by the vendor themselves, or\nby a third party they've hired, or\n\n290\n00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:33.520\nsomebody that's just submitting\nsomething through a bug bounty program.\n\n291\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.400\nWhen they get those, they don't go, wow,\n\n292\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.700\nyou found a vulnerability,\nhere's your check, and throw it aside.\n\n293\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.110\nThey immediately start working on\na way to fix that, to patch that.\n\n294\n00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.260\nTo get it out to the people that\npaid money for their product, so\n\n295\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.529\nthat they're no longer vulnerable to that.\n\n296\n00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:51.796\nAll right, but\nif I'm not getting my updates regularly,\n\n297\n00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:55.876\nthen I'm vulnerable to things that\nthere's already patches made for.\n\n298\n00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:58.456\nSo you have to make sure you're\nkeeping things up to date.\n\n299\n00:15:58.456 --> 00:16:03.797\nThat means your operating system,\nwhatever we have to do to update those.\n\n300\n00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.950\nYour applications that you're running,\nthose have to be updated.\n\n301\n00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.780\nThey have their own vulnerabilities.\n\n302\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.181\nWhat else was I gonna say with that?\n\n303\n00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:16.023\nThe firmware on inter connectivity\ndevices, routers and switches and\n\n304\n00:16:16.023 --> 00:16:17.590\naccess points.\n\n305\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.810\nThat has to be kept up to date,\n\n306\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.340\nbecause that's how they patch theirs\nis they release new firmware to fix\n\n307\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.100\nvulnerabilities that they found\nin their OS for their device.\n\n308\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.190\nSo, important stay on\ntop of patch management.\n\n309\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.975\nThen we typically do a post scan.\n\n310\n00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:38.885\nLet's see, so I ran the scan on DC1,\nIt showed me this vulnerability.\n\n311\n00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:39.985\nI did my research.\n\n312\n00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:42.705\nI found that there was actually a fix for\nit.\n\n313\n00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:47.464\nI had to change a registry key and\ndisable this in the interface,\n\n314\n00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:50.320\nand I've done, did it work, right?\n\n315\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.295\nNow I need to scan it again to see if\nit still shows up as a vulnerability.\n\n316\n00:16:54.295 --> 00:17:00.220\nIf I did it correctly, or\nmy method that I chose to do works,\n\n317\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.050\nthen I shouldn't see that vulnerability\nin the report any more, right?\n\n318\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.350\nOr if I went out and got the patch that's\nsupposed to fix that vulnerability,\n\n319\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.440\nthen it shouldn't show up\nin the report any more.\n\n320\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.460\nSo I just wanna confirm.\n\n321\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.146\nYou wanna run that scan again to make sure\nthat your efforts were successful and\n\n322\n00:17:14.146 --> 00:17:17.558\nthat you did indeed remove\nthat vulnerability, right?\n\n323\n00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:23.068\nSo, there’s a cycle there, it's identify\nyour assets, categorize them, because\n\n324\n00:17:23.068 --> 00:17:28.440\nsome machines I might scan once a day\nother machines I might scan once a month.\n\n325\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.180\nCategorize them, scan them.\n\n326\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.860\nDo your risk assessment or\nyour ranking of the risk.\n\n327\n00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.820\nWhether you use your vulnerability\nscanner's ranking or\n\n328\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.850\nyou do your own ranking.\n\n329\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.700\nDo your patch management, and\nthen scan it again, right?\n\n330\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.690\n&gt;&gt; And just to clarify, I don't think it\nwas a million dollars per vulnerability.\n\n331\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.070\nIt might have been like annually.\n\n332\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.200\nIt just depends on the level,\nyou'll do fine, value you get paid.\n\n333\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nI mean I know people that that's what\n\n334\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.520\nthey do.\n\n335\n00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.510\nIs they just do, they hammer\nweight applications and look for\n\n336\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.750\nvulnerabilities and\nthey try to make their money doing that.\n\n337\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.570\nAnd it's a good thing,\nit can be kinda fun, too.\n\n338\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.200\nBut you gotta like sitting in front\nof a computer, crunching numbers and\n\n339\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.520\nusing fuzzers and [LAUGH]\ndisassemblers and all that fun stuff.\n\n340\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.960\nBut it is a good time,\nbut that's another class.\n\n341\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.260\nLet's see what else they talk about\nwith vulnerability management.\n\n342\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.500\nHost identification, port scanning.\n\n343\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.200\nWe talk about host identification,\ntalk about port scanning,\n\n344\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.220\ntalking about looking on our network to\nfind out what machines we have out there.\n\n345\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.630\nAs well as determining what\nports those machines have open.\n\n346\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.910\nMost services that are providing\na service to the network bind to a port.\n\n347\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.690\nThey listen on that port, and\n\n348\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.929\nthey accept incoming requests to\nprovide whatever service it is.\n\n349\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.420\nLike DHCP on 67 or DNS on 53 or\nweb traffic on port 80, right?\n\n350\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.400\nSo if I scan a machine and\n\n351\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.310\nI see that port 80 is open, I think this\nmachine is probably running a web server.\n\n352\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.180\nWait a second, that's my file server.\n\n353\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.780\nThere should be no web services on there.\n\n354\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.870\nSomething is wrong, right?\n\n355\n00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.770\nDing, ding ding.\n\n356\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.270\nThe alarms go off.\n\n357\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.530\nWhy is port 20 and\n21 open on this machine?\n\n358\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.720\nWe don't use FTP in this network.\n\n359\n00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.990\nSo, identifying your host and\nusing your port scanners.\n\n360\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.150\nNow, one of my favorite\ntools to use to do this kind\n\n361\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.680\nof thing is probably everybody\nelse's favorite tool as well.\n\n362\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.100\nAnd that would be Nmap.\n\n363\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.885\nNmap is a great tool to\nfind your live hosts,\n\n364\n00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:34.940\nit'll do your host identification,\nas well as doing your port scan.\n\n365\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.680\nSo I'll show you a quick demo, I mean\nhopefully you've seen Nmap at this point.\n\n366\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.840\nIf not,\nit's a great tool to go out and get.\n\n367\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.410\nThere's a Windows port for it,\nit's a Linux based or a Nix based tool.\n\n368\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.270\nI can do an Nmap, oops, if I can type.\n\n369\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.180\nLet me bump that font up just a wee bit.\n\n370\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.340\nThere we go.\n\n371\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.230\nI'll do an nmap -help for example.\n\n372\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:03.730\nI can go out and get the different\nswitches that are available for Nmap.\n\n373\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.490\nNmap is an extremely powerful tool.\n\n374\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.280\nIt does, and I know I'm scrolling by fast,\nyou're not expected to read any of that.\n\n375\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.930\nNmap is a very powerful tool.\n\n376\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.160\nIt does a lot more than\njust port scanning.\n\n377\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.000\nHas its own scripting engine in there.\n\n378\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.860\nThe Nmap scripting engine.\n\n379\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.410\nIt can scan for vulnerabilities as well,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n380\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.220\nIt has built in scripts that can\ndo SMB vulnerability scanning\n\n381\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.730\nif you choose to do so.\n\n382\n00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:32.300\n&gt;&gt; No Mike, if we begin to run some type\nof port scan we start enumerating and\n\n383\n00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.900\nchecking each port sequentially here.\n\n384\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.120\nSome intrusion detection systems or\n\n385\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.410\nintrusion prevention systems may\nflag this as an actual attack so\n\n386\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.770\nwe probably wanna be cautious as\nto where we're running this tool.\n\n387\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, don't do this, I did\nsay go get it right and play with it.\n\n388\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.665\nNot in your work environment,\ndon't do it there.\n\n389\n00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.800\nDo this in a little sandbox.\n\n390\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.450\nDo it in a virtual environment.\n\n391\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.570\nDo it on your home network,\nwhere you can't get in trouble.\n\n392\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.240\nBecause it does generate some traffic.\n\n393\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.380\nAnd if you do, like Cherokee says, if you\ndo a port scan on your web server and\n\n394\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.260\nyour network admins or\nwhoever's running intrusion detection or\n\n395\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.700\nprevention systems,\nyou can definitely set off alarms.\n\n396\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.130\nAnd it probably violates\nyour acceptable use policy,\n\n397\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.900\nunless you're on the IT security team and\nyou have authorization to do it.\n\n398\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.080\nThat's the key,\nmaking sure you have permission for\n\n399\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.200\nwhatever tool you happen to be using.\n\n400\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.820\nSame thing with vulnerability scanners.\n\n401\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.110\nMight as well mention that now as well.\n\n402\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.890\nDon't just go download\na vulnerability scanner trial, and\n\n403\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.760\nstart scanning machines on\nyour corporate network.\n\n404\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.370\nSomebody's gonna come talk to you,\n\n405\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.020\nunless you have permission\nto do that sort of thing.\n\n406\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.179\nLet me do you a real quick here,\nyou know if I do Nmap and\n\n407\n00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:50.719\nyou do have to spell it correctly\nN-M-A-P we could do a dash S-N,\n\n408\n00:21:50.719 --> 00:21:55.233\nand let's do 10.0.100.0/24.\n\n409\n00:21:55.233 --> 00:21:57.262\nAnd we'll let this guy run.\n\n410\n00:21:57.262 --> 00:21:59.193\nI don't even know,\nI think I've got a couple of VMs up and\n\n411\n00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:00.089\nrunning on that network.\n\n412\n00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:02.250\nWe'll see what it comes back with.\n\n413\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.563\nSN is just doing a ping sweep basically,\n\n414\n00:22:05.563 --> 00:22:09.758\nthe old capital P switch that\nwe used to use is now N.\n\n415\n00:22:09.758 --> 00:22:13.718\nBut what this is doing is I'm telling\nNmap to take every IP address\n\n416\n00:22:13.718 --> 00:22:18.615\non the 10.0.100.0/24 networks,\nso 255, 256 addresses,\n\n417\n00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:24.330\nand it's pinging them, and it's gonna\ncome back and tell me which ones respond.\n\n418\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.680\nKeep in mind it doesn't necessarily\nmean a host is up or down, right.\n\n419\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.460\nIf it's up and not responding to pings,\nit might change my results.\n\n420\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.120\nThere's other things you can do with\nan Nmap or TCP connect scans and\n\n421\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.040\nthings like that, stealth scans,\nother types of scans you can do.\n\n422\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.160\nJust wanted to show you one\nhere to kinda get you the idea.\n\n423\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.420\nBut I can see it came\nback with some results.\n\n424\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.320\nSo what do I have?\n\n425\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:54.160\nThere's one, host is up,\nand that was this one here.\n\n426\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.601\nSo ten I got zero or 100.10.\n\n427\n00:22:56.601 --> 00:22:58.832\nI got 100.200.\n\n428\n00:22:58.832 --> 00:23:01.489\nI got 100.201.\n\n429\n00:23:01.489 --> 00:23:05.193\nAnd I got 100.15 is up.\n\n430\n00:23:05.193 --> 00:23:07.387\nIt take about 30 seconds to scan.\n\n431\n00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:12.168\nSo it's showing me, helping me discover\ndevices out there on my network.\n\n432\n00:23:12.168 --> 00:23:17.440\nIf I wanna do a port scan with Nmap,\nI can take one of those live hosts now and\n\n433\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.530\nI can say Nmap, let's just do a It'll\n\n434\n00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.500\ntake it a minute but\nwe'll let it finish while we talk.\n\n435\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.270\nSo I'm taking the IP address cuz\nI saw that it was up, right?\n\n436\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.496\nAnd I'm gonna do a -A, which does\na combination of several different things.\n\n437\n00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:43.010\nIt's gonna do a port scan,\nit's also gonna do OS detection,\n\n438\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.390\nit's also gonna do versioning on\nthe different ports that are open.\n\n439\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.730\nTrying to figure out not\nonly is that port open but\n\n440\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.220\nwhat service that is\nrunning behind that port.\n\n441\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.550\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll let that run.\n\n442\n00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.830\nWhile we continue to talk I'll make\nthat a little bit bigger there.\n\n443\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.520\nWe'll let that go.\nThat will take it a minute doing that -A\n\n444\n00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.694\nagainst that host.\n\n445\n00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:06.934\nShould take it While,\nLet's see what else we've got to do.\n\n446\n00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:09.990\nThe last thing I want to talk about while\nwe're waiting for this scan to finish, and\n\n447\n00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.150\nwe talked about NMAP.\n\n448\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.560\nRemember, NMAP can do limited\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n449\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.650\nReally, you're usually talking about\nthings like Nessus or openvas or\n\n450\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:25.020\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer when\nit comes to doing vulnerability scans.\n\n451\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.502\nNMAP primarily does your port scans,\nlike I said,\n\n452\n00:24:28.502 --> 00:24:31.370\nit is got some pretty cool capabilities\nand it being a scripting language,\n\n453\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.080\nyou can really pretty much do\nwhatever you want with it.\n\n454\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.180\nPenetration testing.\n\n455\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.570\nI do want to take a second to\nmention penetration testing and\n\n456\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.450\ntalk about the difference because a lot\nof people will try to use the term\n\n457\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.850\nvulnerability scanning and\npenetration testing interchangeable.\n\n458\n00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.610\nAnd they're not,\nthey're not the same thing, all right.\n\n459\n00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:57.370\nA vulnerability scan is scanning for\na known set of vulnerabilities.\n\n460\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.260\nIt's got a definition or database\nthat's storing these definitions and\n\n461\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.410\nscanning those and it's telling you yes or\nno, if any of those match.\n\n462\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.150\nThat's it, it's not going any further,\n\n463\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.760\nit's not trying to capitalize on\nthe vulnerability that it found.\n\n464\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Use social engineering.\n\n465\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's not putting anything\ntogether exactly Cherokee, and\n\n466\n00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.780\nthat's the thing with penetration testing.\n\n467\n00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.392\nPenetration testing, vulnerability\nscanning is a part of penetration testing,\n\n468\n00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:26.800\nbut that's not all penetration\ntesting is about, right?\n\n469\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.760\nPenetration testing is now gonna say, hey,\n\n470\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.180\ncan I take that vulnerability and\nget somewhere with it?\n\n471\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.845\nI see that you've got a server facing\nthe outside that has a vulnerability\n\n472\n00:25:36.845 --> 00:25:39.485\nnow I'm going to see if I can\nexploit that vulnerability and\n\n473\n00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:42.465\nget access to your web server and\nhow far can I get there.\n\n474\n00:25:42.465 --> 00:25:43.425\nAnd, like Cherokee said,\n\n475\n00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:46.415\nit doesn't bring in the human\nelement whereas pen testing does.\n\n476\n00:25:46.415 --> 00:25:49.581\nVulnerability scanning might find\nthat you have this vulnerability.\n\n477\n00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:54.325\nPenetration testing, I'm gonna be\nable to say, you know, we've got that\n\n478\n00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:59.630\nvulnerability and this vulnerability and\ncombined with a little social engineering,\n\n479\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.340\nI might be able to take all three of\nthese things and perform an attack.\n\n480\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.430\nBut the vulnerability scan is never\ngonna show you that vulnerability,\n\n481\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:11.600\nthe one that took the human thinking or\nproblem-solving to find, all right.\n\n482\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.655\nSo penetration testing is much more\nthorough than vulnerability scanning is\n\n483\n00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:17.970\ngonna be, very important part\nof maintaining our network.\n\n484\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.670\nAll right, let's take a look at\nthe results of my NMAP scan,\n\n485\n00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.370\nhere's where I ran that command.\n\n486\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.480\nAnd I can see where it's come back, and\nit's showing me the different ports that\n\n487\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.020\nare opened and it's also showing me\nwhat it thinks is behind those ports.\n\n488\n00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.080\nA lot of times, you can guess by\n\n489\n00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.190\nseeing port 3389, by seeing 53,\nby seeing 389, and 636.\n\n490\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:49.060\nI'm like, okay this is probably a Windows\nmachine running active directory, 389,\n\n491\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.810\n636 are my active directory and\nsecure active directory connections.\n\n492\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:58.754\nDNS on port 53, 389 is my default\nremote desktop protocol of Windows,\n\n493\n00:26:58.754 --> 00:27:02.322\nso I'm pretty sure this is\nprobably a Windows device.\n\n494\n00:27:02.322 --> 00:27:05.360\nYou know, it's giving me information\nabout the operating system.\n\n495\n00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.660\n&gt;&gt; So all this is really focusing\non that one particular machine, and\n\n496\n00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.130\nwe could call it fingerprinting.\n\n497\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.380\nWhereas obtaining network\ninformation would be footprinting.\n\n498\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n499\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.350\nI can see it's done some\nOS guessing down here.\n\n500\n00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.570\nIt's funny how down here it says it might\nbe Windows 10, it might be Windows 7,\n\n501\n00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.770\nit might be Windows 7 Service Pack 1.\n\n502\n00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.440\nUp here it's really sure\nthat it's 2016 data center,\n\n503\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.670\nit's nailed it down to the build number,\nright?\n\n504\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:40.870\nSo you can get an idea of just doing\nthe OS guessing versus combining that with\n\n505\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.430\nport scanning and then versioning on those\nport scans and doing a verbose option.\n\n506\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.340\n&gt;&gt; More definitive outcome there?\n\n507\n00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and really this is where it\nfound a lot of it, was SMB OS discovery.\n\n508\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.710\nNow this is actually\nthe name of the script\n\n509\n00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:55.920\nthat it's running in the background.\n\n510\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.190\nIt ran two different SMB scripts,\nSMB security mode and SMB OS discovery.\n\n511\n00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.911\nAnd I could run those scripts on their\nown, I could do an nmap-script--\n\n512\n00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:10.130\nsmb-os-discovery and just run that script\nagainst the particular IP address.\n\n513\n00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.370\nThe capital A happens to\ninclude those scripts.\n\n514\n00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.030\nBut you can see, it's pulling\nback information about the name,\n\n515\n00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.180\nabout the domain I belong to,\nthe account use.\n\n516\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.860\nSo it looks like I've got guest access for\nSMB enabled.\n\n517\n00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.250\nSo that's the idea of doing a port scan,\nwe already solved the results\n\n518\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:33.430\nfrom my reports and we got to see\nthe end results of a vulnerability scan.\n\n519\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.050\nSo, a couple different tools and\n\n520\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.480\na lot of information there\nabout vulnerability scanning.\n\n521\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nexplaining that to us today, Mike.\n\n522\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.460\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but stay tuned,\n\n523\n00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.160\nwe do have more GIAC headed your way.\n\n524\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.180\nFor this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign-off.\n\n525\n00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.302\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n526\n00:28:48.302 --> 00:28:49.558\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n527\n00:28:49.558 --> 00:28:53.142\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on

00:00:12.142\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITVProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:15.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.850\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.380\nIn this episode we'll be\nlooking at intrusion detection\n\n7\n00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.490\nin intrusion prevention systems.\n\n8\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.010\nWith us today we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.310\nThan you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.926\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here so formal.\n\n11\n00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:28.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:29.831\nMike Rodrick, I like it.\n\n13\n00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.700\nAll right, but thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.310\nGlad to be here, excited as always.\n\n15\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.380\nWe're doing our GIAC G-Sec certification.\n\n16\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.420\nOr I guess that's a little redundant,\nsince GSEC includes GIAC.\n\n17\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.480\nBut you guys know why you're here.\n\n18\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.212\nAnd Cherokee is absolutely right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:46.763\nWe're gonna be talking about IDS and\nIPS in this particular episode.\n\n20\n00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.810\nAnd we'll even do a bit\nof a demonstration, or\n\n21\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.930\na very simple demonstration\non an IDS system.\n\n22\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.810\nSo let's define those terms, make sure\nwe're familiar with what those acronyms\n\n23\n00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.700\nstand for and the difference between them,\ncuz I think that is a confusing point for\n\n24\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.270\npeople that are newer to\nthis type of technology,\n\n25\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.852\ntrying to understand what the difference\nis between an IDS and an IPS.\n\n26\n00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:12.220\nAnd we'l talk about some pros and\ncons of the systems.\n\n27\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.260\nAnd also some deployment considerations,\n\n28\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.730\nwhere we wanna think about\nputting these in our network.\n\n29\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.990\nSo let's start by again\ndefining those terms.\n\n30\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.013\nAs Cherokee told you\nin the very beginning,\n\n31\n00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:27.069\nwe're talking about intrusion detection\nsystems and intrusion prevention systems.\n\n32\n00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.040\nSo IDS, intrusion detection system,\nIPS, intrusion prevention system.\n\n33\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.420\nVery similar, but there is a subtle, yet\nvery important difference between the two.\n\n34\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.270\nWhen we talk about\nan intrusion detection system,\n\n35\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.060\nwe're talking about something that we can\nplace on our network or on a host and\n\n36\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.400\nit's going to detect Intrusions, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.045\nNow if we think about that word,\ndetect, what do you think Cherokee?\n\n38\n00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.310\nDoes that mean anything to you?\n\n39\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.010\n&gt;&gt; Sound the alarm, let someone know.\n\n40\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n41\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's doing just that.\n\n42\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.210\nIt's gonna watch for us or with us,\nthat's probably a better term.\n\n43\n00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.120\nAnd it's going to give us an alert\nin the event that something matches\n\n44\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.280\none of its definitions of what\nit should be looking for, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.030\nIf we're looking for at signs of attack,\nmalware, things like that.\n\n46\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120\nBut we wanna think about when\nwe talk about detect, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.630\nwe say that it can alert you.\n\n48\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.100\nWhat I want you to really think about is,\nthis means it's a passive system.\n\n49\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.050\nIt will detect or it can detect an attack,\nor attack behavior, or malware.\n\n50\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.764\nAnd it can log that information.\n\n51\n00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:39.760\nThat's it, it's a passive system.\n\n52\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.790\nIt doesn't do anything\nto contain the attack or\n\n53\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.690\ntry to mitigate the attack or\nanything like that.\n\n54\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.820\nAll it's going to do is say hey,\nCherokee, there's an attack.\n\n55\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.330\nYour DNS server was scanned ten\ntimes in the last two minutes.\n\n56\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.400\nYou know?\nOr\n\n57\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.950\nthere was this sort of\nbehavior occurring here.\n\n58\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.340\nIt's gonna let you know that it happened.\n\n59\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.900\nYou're gonna have a record\nof what happened.\n\n60\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.730\nBut it's already happened and this isn't\ngonna know a thing to help you stop it.\n\n61\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.580\nAll right?\nThat doesn't mean it's not a good thing.\n\n62\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.260\nDon't get me wrong, it's very important.\n\n63\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.629\nWe like our IDS's and we still use them\nand sometimes in combination with IPS's.\n\n64\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.370\nAnd I'll talk about why,\nand where we might do that.\n\n65\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.950\nSo they're very useful items.\n\n66\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.840\nI don't wanna make it sound like I'm\nsaying that these aren't any good,\n\n67\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.970\nbecause all they do is detect.\n\n68\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.620\nThat's a very important part of it.\n\n69\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.052\nAs a security personnel\nworking with cyber security,\n\n70\n00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:40.020\nwe have a lot of data to sift through,\nlog files.\n\n71\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.430\nThere's a ton of information coming at us\nfrom all different sources, server logs,\n\n72\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.790\nclient logs, router logs,\nfirewall logs, network activity logs.\n\n73\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.350\nI mean it's just coming from everywhere.\n\n74\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.000\nSo anything that I can do to help automate\nthat process using an IDS to help me\n\n75\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.930\nmonitor those kind of things and alert\nme when something goes on is a very good\n\n76\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.400\nthing, because there's gonna be a lot of\ninformation that's not an alert, right?\n\n77\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700\nLooking at log files, we know that\nthe majority of the information in the log\n\n78\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.000\nfiles is gonna be normal activity\nthat's supposed to be occurring.\n\n79\n00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.230\nAnd we gotta sift through there and find\nthe details of when there's something that\n\n80\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.410\nwas, out of normal or\nshould not be occurring.\n\n81\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.120\nSo IDS's are good, but\nthey are passive system.\n\n82\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.600\nSo we gotta understand what\ntheir capabilities are.\n\n83\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080\nWhen we're making our plan,\nwhat we wanna put?\n\n84\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.620\nHow we're gonna protect our system?\n\n85\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.050\nWe've got to understand if I put\nan IDS in, this is what it's gonna do.\n\n86\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.520\nI can't expect anymore out of it.\n\n87\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.790\nAs I've said it's a passive system.\n\n88\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.120\nThey can be placed either in line.\n\n89\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.021\nMeaning that all traffic can flow through\nthe IDS, or they can be placed what\n\n90\n00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:45.996\nthey call out of band, or where we have\nalmost like a, well, you can hook it up\n\n91\n00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:50.742\nto a switch with a port bearing port so\nthat all traffic is sent as normal but\n\n92\n00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:55.185\nalso goes out to the IDS system,\nto where it's seeing all traffic but\n\n93\n00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:59.200\nthe traffic is not flowing\nspecifically through the device.\n\n94\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.790\nAnd that's an important\nthing to think about.\n\n95\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.860\nWhen we talk about IDS's and IPS's and\n\n96\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.010\nwe talk about performance,\nright, if all of my network.\n\n97\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.760\nLet's say I decide to put\nthis right behind my firewall\n\n98\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.840\nat the edge of my network.\n\n99\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290\nThat means all traffic that's coming\ninto my network is going through there.\n\n100\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.660\nNow, can that device handle\nthat amount of bandwidth?\n\n101\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.730\nHow much traffic do I have coming in?\n\n102\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.010\nAnd it's not doing like a firewall\nmight be just looking at source and\n\n103\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.450\ndestination, and deciding whether\nit's gonna pass it or drop it.\n\n104\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.020\nYou know?\n\n105\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.110\nIt's doing inspections on these packets,\nand that's very in sense of process and\n\n106\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.850\nit can slow things down.\n\n107\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.700\nIt can become a bottle neck, so\nwe do have to be careful with that.\n\n108\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.840\nIf I put it out of bound, or out of band,\nexcuse me, now the traffic can still flow.\n\n109\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.320\nIf the IDS gets overwhelmed and can't\nkeep up, we might miss some information.\n\n110\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.630\nBut it's not gonna shut my network down.\n\n111\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.330\nThings still flow, people can still work.\n\n112\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.490\nThey don't notice that\nthe IDS has gone down.\n\n113\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.100\nIt doesn't affect the network\nperformance in any way.\n\n114\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.230\nIf we start talking about\nintrusion prevention systems,\n\n115\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.780\nwell now you're probably se,\ngoing with that term right?\n\n116\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.910\nPrevention, hmm, that sounds a little\nmore active than detection, right?\n\n117\n00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.710\nAnd it is.\n\n118\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.121\nA prevention system can detect\nan attack or malicious behavior but\n\n119\n00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:18.089\nit can try to do something\nabout it to prevent it.\n\n120\n00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.004\nAll right, now I do wanna be careful\nwith the term prevention because if I've\n\n121\n00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:25.170\ndetected the attack,\nthat means it's already started.\n\n122\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.683\nRight, something is already going on.\n\n123\n00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:29.505\nSo when I say prevention or\nwhen they say prevention,\n\n124\n00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.018\nwe're not preventing it from ever\nhappening in the first place but\n\n125\n00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:36.110\nwhat we can do is prevent\nit from going any further.\n\n126\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.350\nWe can contain it.\n\n127\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.230\nWe can maybe spot it before it\nactually causes any damage or\n\n128\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.120\nthey access anything sensitive.\n\n129\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.500\nAnd that's what we mean\nby prevention there.\n\n130\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.720\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, let's say I had an IPS\ndetect some kind of port scan activity.\n\n131\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.660\nAnd perhaps the IPS\nsystem was able to detect\n\n132\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.770\nthe source IP address that was\ninitiating that port scan.\n\n133\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.730\nSo by blocking on the fly,\n\n134\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:06.362\nchanging the firewall settings to\nblock traffic from that particular IP.\n\n135\n00:07:06.362 --> 00:07:08.440\nThen maybe,\nis that what you're talking about here?\n\n136\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.200\nI'm taking some kind of\naction to try to mitigate or\n\n137\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.900\nprevent that attack from even occurring?\n\n138\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.355\n&gt;&gt; That is a perfect explanation.\n\n139\n00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:16.900\nThat's exactly what it's going to do.\n\n140\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.070\nAnd we can set different rules.\n\n141\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.890\nWe can say, look.\n\n142\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.880\nIf we see scanned, or\nport scans from the same IP address.\n\n143\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.690\nMore than three times within\na ten minute period or\n\n144\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.810\nwhatever kind of rules we wanna set up-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n145\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.120\n&gt;&gt; We can detect that behavior and\n\n146\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.970\nthen do something like you\nsaid block that IP address.\n\n147\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.660\nOr it might be an internal machine\nthat all of a sudden is generating\n\n148\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.300\na lot of FTP traffic, right?\n\n149\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.840\nWhich is usually a good sign that\nI've got data exfiltration going on.\n\n150\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.226\nMaybe it shuts the network adapter down.\n\n151\n00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:46.843\nMaybe not on the machine itself but\n\n152\n00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:50.355\nit shuts that port down on the switch\nthat that machine is connected to, and\n\n153\n00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:52.889\nit's gonna stop that traffic from flowing,\nright?\n\n154\n00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.846\nSo it's exactly what\nan IPS is going to do.\n\n155\n00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:57.525\nWe consider them active.\n\n156\n00:07:57.525 --> 00:07:59.764\nRather than passive cuz\nthey can do things.\n\n157\n00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:02.750\nThey can still send us alerts\njust like an IDS does.\n\n158\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.660\nThey'll still alert us.\n\n159\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.420\nThey'll still log everything.\n\n160\n00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.800\nBut again, they're gonna be able to\npotentially do something about it,\n\n161\n00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.170\nall right?\n\n162\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.329\nNormally, intrusion prevention\nsystems are placed inline.\n\n163\n00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:20.189\nBecause if they're gonna do something\nabout it, that traffic flowing\n\n164\n00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:24.887\nthrough them is gonna let them be\nproactive about this information,\n\n165\n00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:29.990\nwhich also means they can become\na bottleneck, so we do have to watch that.\n\n166\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:36.070\nIt can be obviously very performance\nintensive or workload intensive.\n\n167\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:41.170\nNow there are pros and cons to both\nIDSs and IPSs, so let's go over those.\n\n168\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.308\nAnd we talk about IDSs, let's start there.\n\n169\n00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:46.920\nWe'll talk about pros and cons for\nthe intrusion detection systems.\n\n170\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.380\nA pro would be they can detect both\nexternal and internal attacks, right?\n\n171\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.316\nDepending on where they're placed, really\ndetermines what they're able to detect.\n\n172\n00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:03.680\nOne thing I didn't mention there are host\nbase, IDSs, and IPS, or a HIPs, or HIDs.\n\n173\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.590\nThere are network based\nintrusion detection and\n\n174\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.150\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n175\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.630\nHIPs, host based intrusion prevention,\nHIPs and HIDs.\n\n176\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n177\n00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:14.121\nI gotta remember all these networks.\n\n178\n00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:17.466\n&gt;&gt; I know, the NIPs and NIDs,\nit's kind of like a tongue twister here.\n\n179\n00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:19.124\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n180\n00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:22.805\nBut you can have host based or network\nbased intrusion detection systems or\n\n181\n00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.810\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n182\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.422\nAnd the thing to keep in mind there\nis what they're gonna protect.\n\n183\n00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:30.249\nIf it's a host based detection or\nprevention system,\n\n184\n00:09:30.249 --> 00:09:34.613\nthen it's only monitoring that host,\nits behavior, traffic that's coming in and\n\n185\n00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:36.160\nout of that particular host.\n\n186\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.437\nAnd it'll protect that machine but\nnothing else.\n\n187\n00:09:38.437 --> 00:09:42.139\nNetwork based would monitor\nall of the network traffic.\n\n188\n00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:46.461\nSo no particular host, but\nthe traffic flowing across the network.\n\n189\n00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.375\nSo many times we'll implement both.\n\n190\n00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:51.853\nWe'll have some network based intrusion\nprevention systems monitoring\n\n191\n00:09:51.853 --> 00:09:53.205\nthe network traffic.\n\n192\n00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:57.918\nBut also on some of my more sensitive\nmachines, my mission critical servers that\n\n193\n00:09:57.918 --> 00:10:02.913\nhave different information or financial\ninformation, or that are prime targets for\n\n194\n00:10:02.913 --> 00:10:07.169\nattacks, I might run host based\nsystems on those particular machines.\n\n195\n00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:10.322\nSo we kinda get double coverage there,\nall right?\n\n196\n00:10:10.322 --> 00:10:14.354\nBut back to the pros and cons with\nthe IDSs, internal and external attacks,\n\n197\n00:10:14.354 --> 00:10:17.252\ncentralized management for\ncorrelation of attacks,\n\n198\n00:10:17.252 --> 00:10:20.930\nwhich is another good thing\nbecause it's seeing everything.\n\n199\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.794\nWe can go to that device, read those logs\nand reports that it's gonna generate.\n\n200\n00:10:24.794 --> 00:10:27.572\nAnd it's gonna be from the entire network,\nso\n\n201\n00:10:27.572 --> 00:10:30.860\nit makes it a little bit\neasier to work with.\n\n202\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.918\nIt does add to our defense\nin-depth strategy.\n\n203\n00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:36.559\nIt's definitely not our one little silver\nbullet, that's all we're gonna do and\n\n204\n00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:38.170\nwe don't need anything else.\n\n205\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.536\nBut it does add to our\ndefense in-depth and\n\n206\n00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:43.045\nit gives us the ability\nto quantify attacks.\n\n207\n00:10:43.045 --> 00:10:47.551\nBecause we're gonna have the information\nabout the attack, what was going on,\n\n208\n00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:49.400\nwe can see that information.\n\n209\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.353\nIf it's something that's repeated,\nwe have records of that.\n\n210\n00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:57.688\n&gt;&gt; Perform a historical analysis\nof the different types of attacks,\n\n211\n00:10:57.688 --> 00:11:00.825\nthen you can potentially\nprevent those from reoccurring.\n\n212\n00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:01.439\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It makes sense.\n\n213\n00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:03.813\n&gt;&gt; It might impact your risk management.\n\n214\n00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:05.268\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n215\n00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:09.825\n&gt;&gt; Because I might think, well, this kind\nof risk or this particular threat or\n\n216\n00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:14.922\nvulnerability, we classify it as\na medium impact, low probability, right?\n\n217\n00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:18.640\nBut now, come to find out after running\nan IDS for a few months, we see that,\n\n218\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.254\nwow-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It\n\n219\n00:11:19.254 --> 00:11:19.833\nhappens more than we thought.\n\n220\n00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:21.597\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, surprise, surprise.\n\n221\n00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.788\nAnd now all of the sudden we're like,\nwell,\n\n222\n00:11:23.788 --> 00:11:25.760\nwe need to change that on my risk matrix.\n\n223\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.198\nAnd maybe put a little priority\non implementing a fix for\n\n224\n00:11:29.198 --> 00:11:33.307\nthis particular vulnerability,\nso it does give us that ability.\n\n225\n00:11:33.307 --> 00:11:35.997\nCons, false negatives,\nand false positives,\n\n226\n00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:39.096\nthese are gonna be the big\nproblems with these systems.\n\n227\n00:11:39.096 --> 00:11:40.946\nBot that it's a insurmountable problem,\nbut\n\n228\n00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:42.853\nit is something that we\njust have to be aware of.\n\n229\n00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:45.039\nWhen we talk about a false positive and\n\n230\n00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:49.890\na false negative, there's really four\nresponses you can get from these systems.\n\n231\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.150\nTrue positive, true negative,\nfalse positive, false negative, right?\n\n232\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:57.176\nA true positive means I got an alert and\nthere was an attack.\n\n233\n00:11:57.176 --> 00:12:01.392\nA true negative means I didn't get\nan alert and there was no attack.\n\n234\n00:12:01.392 --> 00:12:03.148\nGreat, great,\nboth of those are really good to get.\n\n235\n00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:06.649\nA false positive means I got an alert but\nthere was no attack.\n\n236\n00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:10.941\nIt could've been just a misconfiguration,\nor a misinterpretation.\n\n237\n00:12:10.941 --> 00:12:15.238\nIt could be some behavior that's\nacceptable on our network but\n\n238\n00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:19.020\nnot normal, so\nthe system didn't know about it.\n\n239\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.417\nBut it's let us know there was a problem.\n\n240\n00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:22.734\nAnd we do our research and\n\n241\n00:12:22.734 --> 00:12:26.165\nwe come to find out there was not\nany type of malicious behavior.\n\n242\n00:12:26.165 --> 00:12:30.678\n&gt;&gt; So I guess depending on the different\ntype of analysis engine that that\n\n243\n00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:35.956\nintrusion detection or prevention system\nwould be using, depending on the style\n\n244\n00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:41.025\nthat you used, it may create more or\nless false positives, false negatives.\n\n245\n00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:45.181\nFor example, if you're using something\nlike a behavioral or heuristic space,\n\n246\n00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.601\nthey may have that tuning period\nthat originally, like you said,\n\n247\n00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.810\nthey may detect something\nthat seems like an anomaly.\n\n248\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.624\nBut as time progresses, they see, okay.\n\n249\n00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:56.882\nMaybe this person does\nthis on a regular basis or\n\n250\n00:12:56.882 --> 00:12:59.370\nthis system calls out to\nthis system every so often.\n\n251\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.324\nAnd that's classified as normal behavior.\n\n252\n00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:03.428\n[LAUGH] Whatever normal means, right?\n\n253\n00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:06.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, whatever normal means but\nthat is exactly right.\n\n254\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.502\nUsually setting these systems up,\nit's a learning process or, as you said,\n\n255\n00:13:10.502 --> 00:13:11.379\na tuning period.\n\n256\n00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:16.738\nAnd so you're gonna be overwhelmed,\nespecially as you said,\n\n257\n00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:24.300\nthe behavioral based, the behavioral based\nmodels where they are using behaviors.\n\n258\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.590\nAnd they've gotta learn your network.\n\n259\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.760\nIf it's signature based, then it's a\nmatter of just keeping those signatures up\n\n260\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.590\nto date, making sure you have\nthe latest and greatest.\n\n261\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.895\nIt could be that you've written\nsome of your own signatures and\n\n262\n00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:37.130\nyou've miswritten them,\nmisconfigured them.\n\n263\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.130\nYou've got some signatures\nfrom other partners or\n\n264\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.602\nsomething and\nmaybe they don't work on your network.\n\n265\n00:13:43.602 --> 00:13:46.220\nSo those could all end up\ngenerating those false positives.\n\n266\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.090\nFalse positives are better\nthan false negatives.\n\n267\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.529\nFalse positives will generate more work.\n\n268\n00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.944\nBecause now I've gotta go in and\ndo my research and\n\n269\n00:13:52.944 --> 00:13:55.000\nfind out if it was an attack or not.\n\n270\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.963\nBut I'd much rather be alerted\nabout something that is okay and\n\n271\n00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.816\nnot malicious than to\nnot get alerted at all.\n\n272\n00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:02.630\n&gt;&gt; And having no clue.\n\n273\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is a false negative.\n\n274\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.991\nNo alert, negative on the alert but\nthere was an attack.\n\n275\n00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:13.370\nOr there was something that should've been\nalerted on occurring and it didn't happen.\n\n276\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.020\nThat's a false negative and\nfinding false negative is not easy.\n\n277\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.435\nFinding false positives is easy because\nyou get the alert and you go, what's this?\n\n278\n00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:21.212\nThen you go look at it.\nNow,\n\n279\n00:14:21.212 --> 00:14:23.490\nall of a sudden it's not anything bad.\n\n280\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.470\nSo, okay,\nI can mark that off as a false positive.\n\n281\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.450\nI can fine tune my rules or\nwhatever it is.\n\n282\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.560\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n283\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.790\nIt doesn't give me an alert on false\nnegatives so I'm not gonna know, hey,\n\n284\n00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.930\nlook, it stopped this and\nit shouldn't have.\n\n285\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.850\nOr it alerted me on this and\nit shouldn't have.\n\n286\n00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.470\nIt's just not gonna say anything.\n\n287\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.160\nAnd now I've gotta find that attack or\n\n288\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.910\nmalicious behavior some other way and\nthen realize why didn't my IDS notify me?\n\n289\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.140\nGo back, and now try to figure that out,\nand redo my rules, or\n\n290\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.490\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n291\n00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.420\nSo false negatives are really\ntroublesome with these systems.\n\n292\n00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.020\nBut I was reading an interesting\narticle the other day about this and\n\n293\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.060\nthere's a common misconception\nthat these systems are too new.\n\n294\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.560\nThey produce too many false positive, too\nmany false negatives to make them useful.\n\n295\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.280\nIt's hogwash.\n\n296\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.315\nIn my opinion, in my humble opinion.\n\n297\n00:15:13.315 --> 00:15:14.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I think most security\n\n298\n00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:17.740\nprofessionals' opinions,\ndon't listen to that.\n\n299\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.335\nThat's people that either don't know or\nhaven't dealt with them before,\n\n300\n00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:24.289\nbecause they are good systems.\n\n301\n00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:27.586\nAnd I need all the help I can get\nwhen it comes to getting alerts and\n\n302\n00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:29.308\ncorrelating this information.\n\n303\n00:15:29.308 --> 00:15:36.018\nSo, don't take those articles\nmore than a grain of salt.\n\n304\n00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:36.936\nAll right, anyway.\n\n305\n00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.775\n&gt;&gt; If you did,\nI'd be skinny and rich by now.\n\n306\n00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:40.359\nOr whatever they say.\n\n307\n00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.902\nAll the buttons that you gotta click for\nthose headlines, yeah.\n\n308\n00:15:42.902 --> 00:15:45.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right, what else?\n\n309\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.565\nIf I talk about false positives,\nfalse negatives.\n\n310\n00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:53.354\nA downside of IDS, or a con,\nis that it does detect and not react.\n\n311\n00:15:53.354 --> 00:16:00.072\nSo it could be considered a con.\n\n312\n00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:03.700\nBut honestly if you're buying an intrusion\ndetection system you all ready know that\n\n313\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.510\nupfront it's not gonna react.\n\n314\n00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.700\nIt's gonna be well I guess you could\nsay it's reactive, not preventative.\n\n315\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.340\nIt'd be maybe a better way to say it.\n\n316\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.661\nIt is reacting by alerting you, but\nit's not doing anything about the attack.\n\n317\n00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:18.420\n&gt;&gt; Defensive not offensive maybe,\nin my mind.\n\n318\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe something like that.\n\n319\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.185\nWe'll try that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:21.808\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n321\n00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:24.030\nrequires full time monitoring.\n\n322\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.510\nWell, just about everything does.\n\n323\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.499\nI don't know if that's really a con.\n\n324\n00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:32.024\nWe do need to have people that are trained\nthough in reading the information that is\n\n325\n00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.081\ngetting spit out.\n\n326\n00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:36.690\nAnd it is gonna be a lot of information.\n\n327\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:42.639\nSo just be prepared, it's gonna be\nan enormous amount of data to be analysed.\n\n328\n00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:48.053\nAnd they can be susceptible to what\nwe call slow attacks all right?\n\n329\n00:16:48.053 --> 00:16:52.118\nI heard some people say the slow and\nlow technique all right?\n\n330\n00:16:52.118 --> 00:16:57.360\nBecause what the bad guys are gonna\ntry do is slow their attack down.\n\n331\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.342\nI've said,\nI've mentioned a couple of times,\n\n332\n00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:04.634\nI've hinted at some of the ways these\nrules might read where they say,\n\n333\n00:17:04.634 --> 00:17:09.220\nif there's repeated connection attempts\nto a particular port number from\n\n334\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.539\nthe same IP address, within a ten\nminute period, then send me alert.\n\n335\n00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:17.780\nIf a number exceeds five in a ten minute\nperiod, then I want alert, right?\n\n336\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.581\nOne attempt is not gonna alert me,\n\n337\n00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:24.003\nbecause that could be just somebody that's\nsupposed to be making that connection.\n\n338\n00:17:24.003 --> 00:17:28.401\nThey mistyped the password or who knows,\nbut if it happens again, and again, and\n\n339\n00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:31.294\nwithin a short period of time,\nI need to be notified.\n\n340\n00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:32.934\nI need to check and see what's going on.\n\n341\n00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:40.050\nBut the bad guys know this too, they know\nhow do we set up our IDSs and our IPSs.\n\n342\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.360\nAnd what do they do?\n\n343\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.716\nThey slow their attack down.\n\n344\n00:17:42.716 --> 00:17:46.875\nWhen I run a portscan with nmap,\nwe don't use timing five insane,\n\n345\n00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.519\nyou use timing one right?\n\n346\n00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.868\nA little- t1, that says here,\nsend out one ping.\n\n347\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.727\nSend out another ping, right?\n\n348\n00:17:55.727 --> 00:17:59.399\nAnd that's an eternity in computers,\nif you're just waiting a few seconds or\n\n349\n00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:01.570\neven a little bit longer between those.\n\n350\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:07.783\nAnd maybe, just maybe the IDS won't\ndetect it as one attack, right?\n\n351\n00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:12.652\nBecause of the different rules and\na time that's set up in there.\n\n352\n00:18:12.652 --> 00:18:15.240\nAnd that's something that we\ncan tune though as well right.\n\n353\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.741\nWe can catch onto that and\nwe can start reducing that time,\n\n354\n00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:22.820\nall right I had this setup,\nI got this attack, I wasn't notified.\n\n355\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.535\nNow I'm gonna say if there's more than\nfive within five minutes instead of ten\n\n356\n00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:27.490\nminutes.\n\n357\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.430\nBut now I might get more false\npositives because I've got valid,\n\n358\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.190\nor authorized people failing\nwith their password attempt.\n\n359\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.352\nSo it's a tuning process, trying to find\nwhere I'm not gonna get false positives\n\n360\n00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:40.597\nbut I'm not gonna miss anything, either.\n\n361\n00:18:40.597 --> 00:18:44.401\nWhen we look at IPSs,\nreally a lot of the same pros and\n\n362\n00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:48.898\ncons with IPSs, they do work up\nat the application layer, but\n\n363\n00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:53.780\nthey can prevent attacks rather\nthan just reacting to them,.\n\n364\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.730\nThat's the big advantage to an IPS,\nthat's why they cost more,\n\n365\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.620\nthat's why they're a lot more\nin configuration as well.\n\n366\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.760\nAnd remember what I said about prevention,\n\n367\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.140\nit's preventing the spread,\npreventing the attack from succeeding.\n\n368\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.000\nBut usually there has to be something\nthat we detected in the first place.\n\n369\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.466\nSo the initial phase of\nthe attack is underway, or\n\n370\n00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:18.940\nthe footprinting part\nof the scanning part.\n\n371\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.920\nMaybe not the actual attack, but just\nunderstand that something has occurred and\n\n372\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.240\nthen the prevention system kicks in.\n\n373\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.139\nAnd hopefully stops it in it's tracks,\nor prevents it from spreading to other\n\n374\n00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:32.268\nmachines on my network,\nthat's the idea there.\n\n375\n00:19:32.268 --> 00:19:33.573\nWhat else?\n\n376\n00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:38.053\nWe can use behavioral approaches,\nwith IDSs it's all signature based,\n\n377\n00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.250\nmatching those definitions.\n\n378\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:46.134\nWith IPSs we can do behavior based where\nwe do start out with a flat baseline and\n\n379\n00:19:46.134 --> 00:19:48.396\nwe let it learn our network and\n\n380\n00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:54.391\nwe slowly eliminate the false positives\nuntil we don't receive any anymore.\n\n381\n00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:58.600\nWe receive very few and now it kind\nof knows what my network baseline is.\n\n382\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.042\nWhat's normal for our network and\nthen it can start doing its job.\n\n383\n00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:10.318\nIt's defense in depth, real-time\nevent correlation is another pro.\n\n384\n00:20:10.318 --> 00:20:16.360\nCons with IPS's can create\nnetwork bottle necks.\n\n385\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.253\nRight I said that when we do\nIDS's that they're put in line,\n\n386\n00:20:19.253 --> 00:20:23.800\nI'm sorry IPS's they're put in line,\nthe prevention systems are in line.\n\n387\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.620\nThis is what gives them the ability\nto say shut off network connectivity\n\n388\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.280\nif they need to.\n\n389\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.570\nSo that they can become a bottle neck if\nthere's a lot of traffic flowing, and\n\n390\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.900\nwe have to monitor that kinda thing.\n\n391\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.120\nCan the IPS that we have keep up with\nthe amount of traffic that we deal with?\n\n392\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.390\nOtherwise we gotta change placements\non them or upgrade the IPS itself,\n\n393\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.500\nmore processor, more memory,\nwhatever it is that we have to do.\n\n394\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.940\nAlso, another big con of IPSs is\nthat they can create false positives\n\n395\n00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.060\nthat create serious problems if\nautomated responses are used.\n\n396\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.460\nNow think about that for a second.\n\n397\n00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.284\nWe've already said that with an IDS a\nfalse positive is a bad thing because it's\n\n398\n00:21:05.284 --> 00:21:08.603\nan alert on something that's\nnot actually an attack.\n\n399\n00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:13.310\nAnd we do our research and\nwe go silly IDS that's not an attack.\n\n400\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.100\nYou can ignore that one right?\n\n401\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.060\nBut if I'm using an IPS, and\nwe've set up mitigation techniques,\n\n402\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.330\nI've got rules that say, if this\nbehavior occurs, shut this port down or\n\n403\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.700\nsegregate this network off or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n404\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.713\nNow a false positive becomes\na little bigger issue.\n\n405\n00:21:32.713 --> 00:21:35.484\nBecause before a false positive would\nbe just me getting an alert and\n\n406\n00:21:35.484 --> 00:21:37.100\ngoing that's nothing to worry about.\n\n407\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.440\nI understand what that is\nwe'll figure that out.\n\n408\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.590\nWith an IP access active a false positive\nbecomes all of a sudden that's servers\n\n409\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.350\nbeen shut off from the network to prevent\nthe spread of malware that didn't exist.\n\n410\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.280\nUsers can't access the services any more.\n\n411\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.200\nWe have downtime until we figure out,\nwas this an attack, or\n\n412\n00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000\nwas this a false positive?\n\n413\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.270\nSo all of a sudden a false positive\nbecomes a much bigger Issue\n\n414\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.180\nwith the IPSs if we've set up\nautomated responses to those alerts.\n\n415\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.700\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n416\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.944\nIt's why we have to tune the systems and\n\n417\n00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:16.501\ntune them regularly to make sure that we\ndon't get those kind of things, so that\n\n418\n00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:21.417\nwe don't have unnecessary downtime because\nthe IPS sent out a false positive right.\n\n419\n00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:24.604\nLast thing I think we'll hit\nbefore we get into our demo here,\n\n420\n00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:28.610\ncuz I know we're getting short,\nis talking about deployment strategies.\n\n421\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:29.920\n&gt;&gt; I think you had a picture for us.\n\n422\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.000\n&gt;&gt; And I do, Cherokee.\n\n423\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.180\nLet's check that out.\n\n424\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.280\nLet's see there we go.\n\n425\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.250\nLet's pull up that pretty picture that\nwe were talking about before the show.\n\n426\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.066\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n427\n00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.644\n&gt;&gt; That's nice, right?\n\n428\n00:22:39.644 --> 00:22:41.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was fun to draw.\n\n429\n00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:43.790\nI'm not good at drawing but\nI do like to draw.\n\n430\n00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:48.570\nAll right, so\nwhat I've got here is just a general idea\n\n431\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.730\nof where I might go about putting my IDSs,\nIPSs, right?\n\n432\n00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.190\nDepending on what I'm trying to do.\n\n433\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.390\nSo let's just take a break it down here.\n\n434\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.751\nI've got my corporate network\nhere in kind of the left center.\n\n435\n00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:02.010\nAnd then off of that I\nhave my data center right?\n\n436\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.344\nSo I might put an ids/,\nand I'll just say my PSs,\n\n437\n00:23:06.344 --> 00:23:09.658\nIDS/IPS, you guys can get the idea.\n\n438\n00:23:09.658 --> 00:23:13.331\nAnd I might put one of those,\nwhat we call them, our sensors,\n\n439\n00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:17.315\nbecause typically have\na centralized management console.\n\n440\n00:23:17.315 --> 00:23:21.160\nThat goes on a particular node\nthat I use to manage my IDS/IPSs.\n\n441\n00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.670\nAnd then we have sensors that we put in.\n\n442\n00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.930\nThose are the devices that either go\ninline or off of a mirrored port.\n\n443\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.956\nSo I would place a sensor in\nbetween my corporate network and\n\n444\n00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:33.810\nthe data center because these\nare sensitive machines.\n\n445\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.510\nThese have corporate secrets,\nthey have healthcare information or\n\n446\n00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.840\nfinancial information\nthat I have to protect.\n\n447\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.760\nSo I need to know what's going on, and\n\n448\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.080\nI wanna make sure I'm alerted\nif anything strange is going on.\n\n449\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.111\nSo we've got one in between our data\ncenter and our corporate network.\n\n450\n00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:52.816\nWe've got one between\nour remote office and\n\n451\n00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:55.386\nour corporate network a good idea there.\n\n452\n00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:57.937\nWe've got one between our extranet right?\n\n453\n00:23:57.937 --> 00:24:01.019\nOur partner network that we've set up So\nthat our vendors,\n\n454\n00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:05.160\nour partner organizations, can access\nour certain resources on our network.\n\n455\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.010\nAnd we all know nothing bad ever happens\nfrom allowing third parties to access your\n\n456\n00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.960\nnetwork [COUGH], Target,\n[COUGH] Home Depot.\n\n457\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.790\nRight?\n\n458\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.020\nNothing bad happens there, no.\n\n459\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.050\nSo yeah,\nwe need to monitor that kind of thing.\n\n460\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.780\nThe DMZ, where I'm allowing\npublic access to my resources,\n\n461\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.300\nmy web server front ends,\nmy mail server front ends.\n\n462\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.260\nI want an IDS or IPS there.\n\n463\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:33.240\nBetween the internet and my firewall,\nor on the other side of that firewall.\n\n464\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.285\nBehind the firewall,\n\n465\n00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:36.990\nthat means all traffic that actually\nmake it through the firewall.\n\n466\n00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.350\nGive the firewall a chance\nto filter some of it.\n\n467\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.230\nAnd then all traffic coming through\nwould go through that device.\n\n468\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.630\nAnd then maybe also on\nmy management network,\n\n469\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.430\nback where I have my node\nthat runs the software\n\n470\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:52.110\nthat I use to control all of these sensors\nand correlate all of this information.\n\n471\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:58.270\nSo one or multiple of those might be\nwhere we choose to place these and\n\n472\n00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.277\ntypically what we see when we\nread best practices from NIST or\n\n473\n00:25:02.277 --> 00:25:04.634\nCERT, at least here in the U.S.,\n\n474\n00:25:04.634 --> 00:25:10.080\nthey say when you're looking at this come\nup with your plan, have your strategy.\n\n475\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.300\nThis is in an ideal world.\n\n476\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.320\nI would like sensors in all these places.\n\n477\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.218\nBut it's not gonna happen.\n\n478\n00:25:14.218 --> 00:25:14.970\nYou're not gonna go out and\n\n479\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.750\nbuy every one of these at one time most\nlikely unless you've got deep pockets.\n\n480\n00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.860\nSo you then prioritize those.\n\n481\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.550\nAnd where am I gonna get the most bang for\nmy buck?\n\n482\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.000\nOr what is the most sensitive\ninformation that I've got to protect?\n\n483\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.510\nSo that one to the data center might be\none that I really want to put in place,\n\n484\n00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:37.710\nbecause that's gonna help me comply\nwith HPPA or or or something like that.\n\n485\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.930\nSo by placing that one there,\nat least I can be compliant.\n\n486\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.980\nI don't have to worry about fines and\nthings like that.\n\n487\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.980\nEventually, I'd like to put these\nin these other places as well, but\n\n488\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.510\nif I can only afford one,\nmaybe that's the first one we put.\n\n489\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:54.070\nSo taking a look at where\nthe incidents would have\n\n490\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.719\nthe highest impact can help me decide\nwhere I wanna place these first.\n\n491\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.350\nEntry in the sensitive domains if you set\na resource domains entry points to that.\n\n492\n00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.320\nJust in general between trusted and\n\n493\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.300\nuntrusted networks like we\nsaw here in the diagram.\n\n494\n00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.200\nBut again don't think you have\nto put all of these at once.\n\n495\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.490\nIt's great if you can don't get me wrong\nif you can convinced the C level people to\n\n496\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.770\ngive you the budget to do that, go for it.\n\n497\n00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.580\nBut if not and you need to tell them,\nthat we need to do this,\n\n498\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.280\nbut they're looking at the numbers\ngoing no way, explain to them, hey,\n\n499\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.760\nwe can do this piecemeal, we can step by\nstep gradually get to where we wanna be,\n\n500\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.370\nby implementing it one piece at a time.\n\n501\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.120\n&gt;&gt; Or, like Mike,\nwe talked about in the previous episode,\n\n502\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.860\ntalking about vulnerability scanners,\nsometimes when you have those,\n\n503\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.870\ngenerate those reports and even putting\nit into a nice graphical representation.\n\n504\n00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.190\nAnytime guys you can equate that to money,\n\n505\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.480\nthen that's really gonna\nsolidify your argument.\n\n506\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.450\nWhen you can quantify that\ndata with a numerical figure,\n\n507\n00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.933\nwhen you're talking dollar signs,\nit makes sense sometimes to them.\n\n508\n00:26:57.933 --> 00:27:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,you know [LAUGH]\nanytime you talk to the C levels,\n\n509\n00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:05.090\nI mean because I'm not saying anything\nbad if you guys out there are C level.\n\n510\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz they'd be smart\nbusiness people, right?\n\n511\n00:27:06.965 --> 00:27:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nI mean you've taken project management and\n\n512\n00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.170\nbusiness classes and things like that.\n\n513\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.990\nAnd we understand that as\na security professional, right?\n\n514\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:19.440\nMy goal is to look out for the next four\nhours, eight hours, 24 hours, 48 hours.\n\n515\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.550\nMy managers are looking out a week\nat a time or what have you.\n\n516\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.190\nThe sea level execs are the ones that\nare looking at a year at a time,\n\n517\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.570\nfive years at a time,\nlong term goals and things like that.\n\n518\n00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.040\nSo of course,\nyou're looking at the bottom line and\n\n519\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.710\nmaking sure that hey we're still getting\naround, in a year and in five years so\n\n520\n00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.430\nthere’s nothing wrong with that it’s just.\n\n521\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.410\nBut yeah dollar signs definitely\nhelp because they can see,\n\n522\n00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.170\nwhat we always want to try\nto show is the impact.\n\n523\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.560\nWhat are we gonna get for this, what\nis and that's sometimes hard to show in\n\n524\n00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:57.020\nsecurity to convince people to spend money\nwhen there’s no immediate gain or result.\n\n525\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.110\nWhat I'm doing is I'm preventing losses.\n\n526\n00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.640\nSo you don't see any financial gain.\n\n527\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, IPS and IDS would\ndefinitely fall under this category.\n\n528\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.490\nYou don't have that initial,\nthat immediate return on investment here.\n\n529\n00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.250\n&gt;&gt; No,\nall you're gonna get is a lack of loss.\n\n530\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.700\nWhich is a good thing but\nsometimes that's hard to do.\n\n531\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's hard to convey that, exactly.\n\n532\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.825\n&gt;&gt; Right, so.\n\n533\n00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:18.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it can be difficult.\n\n534\n00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.330\nBut never fear, you can get it done.\n\n535\n00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.640\nAll right, so I'll just mention, I guess\nactually, why don't we just save that for\n\n536\n00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.360\nthe next one, Cherokee.\n\n537\n00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.400\n&gt;&gt; We've got a couple demos that you\nwanted to do, but we are out of time.\n\n538\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.060\nSo that's okay.\n\n539\n00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.550\nYou can stay tuned and\nwe'll come back right here at ITProTV.\n\n540\n00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.320\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n541\n00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.320\nSo remember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n542\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:38.999\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n543\n00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:42.176\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPROTV.\n\n544\n00:28:42.176 -->

00:00:10.418\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.120\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat intrusion detection and\n\n7\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.660\nthe intrusion prevention systems.\n\n8\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.360\nBut this is actually a part II,\nwhere we're continuing up and\n\n9\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.070\npicking right back up from\nthat previous conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.450\nWith us today,\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.660\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.970\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.070\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.630\nAnd yeah, got a little bit under our belts\nthere talking about good old IDS and\n\n15\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.830\nIPS systems.\n\n16\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.830\nAnd now we're gonna do a little\ndemonstration for you guys out there.\n\n17\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.240\nShow you just a real quick config\non an IDS or IP, actually,\n\n18\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.630\nthis will be an IDS system.\n\n19\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.290\nDefinitely not here to learn\neverything to do with them.\n\n20\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.570\nThere's entire classes on\nsetting these kind of things up,\n\n21\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.020\nbut I thought a little hands-on\nmight be a nice little break.\n\n22\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.910\nThen we're gonna get back\ninto the lecture mode, and\n\n23\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.270\nwe're gonna talk about\nsomething called honeypots.\n\n24\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.950\nSo, if you like your honey,\nstay tuned for that.\n\n25\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730\nAll right, so\nwhen we talk about IDS's and IPS's,\n\n26\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.670\nthere are several out there\nthat you can choose from.\n\n27\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.940\nSome of them are made up of\nsoftware that you might install,\n\n28\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.550\nothers might be an appliance\nthat you put in your rack or\n\n29\n00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.410\nput in your network somewhere and\npatch down.\n\n30\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.830\nIt really depends, I have an example here\non my screen if you want to pull that up.\n\n31\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.590\nI've got TripWire, which is a very\npopular one, has been around for\n\n32\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.960\na long, long time.\n\n33\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.590\n&gt;&gt; I like the name,\nit kind of implies really stealthy and-\n\n34\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes you think.\n\n35\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.180\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense, right?\n\n36\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.390\n&gt;&gt; Like you're setting a booby trap,\nright, and stuff like that.\n\n37\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.150\nI like it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.540\nAnd the other one is Snort, and\n\n39\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330\nthe Snort's always a funny one-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n40\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.490\nthere you go, yep [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.720\n&gt;&gt; On the other end of the spectrum\n\n42\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.230\n&gt;&gt; But everybody knows the pig,\n\n43\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.930\nI mean it is one of,\na very very popular one.\n\n44\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.360\nPrimarily because this one\nis an open source one.\n\n45\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.050\nIt's freely available,\nit's very well supported by the community.\n\n46\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.050\nIt started out as a sniffer,\nand it has evolved,\n\n47\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.898\nit has gone through several evolutions.\n\n48\n00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:09.740\nIt is now-\n&gt;&gt; And I think it's just now even\n\n49\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.229\nbought that manner it paid quite a\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, put a little chunk out there for\n\n50\n00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.060\nthat and it's now an idea.\n\n51\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.690\nSo we're IPs, you can really run\nSnort in several different modes.\n\n52\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.480\nYou can do just sniffer mode.\n\n53\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.450\nYou can do an IDS mode,\nyou can do IPS mode.\n\n54\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.880\nAnd again, like I said, it's open source\nand freely available, there's very good\n\n55\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.990\ncommunity support, with, like,\ncommunity rule sets that you can get.\n\n56\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.430\nFantastic, really good stuff, and it's\na great way to get your feet wet in this,\n\n57\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.010\nbecause it's so full featured yet\nstill available.\n\n58\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.200\nYou know, there are others, like Tripwire\nhas trials that you can work with.\n\n59\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800\nSo you can go out and find a particular\none that you're thinking about buying.\n\n60\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.940\nI definitely recommend that.\n\n61\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.160\nLooking at the research data that's on\nthese particular intrusion detection,\n\n62\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.910\nintrusion protection systems.\n\n63\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.930\nTalking to other people that might\nhave put these into place and\n\n64\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.140\nsee what they think.\n\n65\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.720\nHow easy is it work with, how successful\nis it, once you have it fine tuned,\n\n66\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.900\nhow often do you find that you're\ntuning it or getting false positives?\n\n67\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.600\nThose kind of questions can help you\nnarrow down your focus or your search for\n\n68\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.530\nthe right IDS or IPS for you.\n\n69\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.950\nSo, let's do this,\nlet's do a little demonstration.\n\n70\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.200\nWhat I've got here is that we're just\ngoing to do a very very simple one,\n\n71\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.760\nI've got a Kali Linux machine\nthat I've installed Snort on.\n\n72\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.220\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nthe configuration file, and\n\n73\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.370\nthe rules that we can use within this.\n\n74\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.600\nAnd then we're gonna test it out and\nsee if it actually works, all right.\n\n75\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.530\nSo what I wanna do, I'm gonna start by\nswitching into the directory, just to make\n\n76\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.750\nit a little bit easier for Mike,\ncuz he's not the best typer in the world.\n\n77\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.030\nOops, that was not what I wanted,\nsee I'm already making mistakes.\n\n78\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.930\nAnd inside that Snort directory I\ncan see two really important things,\n\n79\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.300\nlot of important stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.410\nI can see snort.conf, and\na folder called rules, right?\n\n81\n00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.250\nWe'll come back around to\nthose in just a second.\n\n82\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.890\nWhat I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna make my own configuration file.\n\n83\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.390\nAnd so I'm going to use nano,\n\n84\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.980\ndoesn't matter, vi, vim,\nwhatever editor you wanna use.\n\n85\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.940\nAnd I'm going to call this one snort-,\nI don't know,\n\n86\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.310\nlet's call it snort-test.conf, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.210\nAnd it's gonna create this file for\nme, cuz this file doesn't exist yet.\n\n88\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.008\nAnd I'm gonna type in here, include\nswitch, where are we gonna put that.\n\n89\n00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:25.480\nEtsy, Rulem, Snort, Switch.\n\n90\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.228\nAnd I'll just put it\nright there in the rules.\n\n91\n00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:31.430\nICMP-test.rules.\n\n92\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.950\nAll right.\n\n93\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.190\nSo really simply,\nin the configuration file,\n\n94\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.480\nI'm saying hey include this file.rules.\n\n95\n00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.518\nAll right?\n\n96\n00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:44.940\nAnd the file.rules, in my case,\nICMP-test.rules, that's where I defined\n\n97\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.080\nwhat it is that I want it to detect and\ngive me a log entry for, all right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.121\nSo, very simple configuration file,\nwe'll go ahead and save that.\n\n99\n00:04:57.612 --> 00:05:02.911\nAnd, We can see I now have a file,\n\n100\n00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:07.020\nshould somewhere in here,\ncalled snort-test.conf.\n\n101\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.360\nSo I've got my configuration file.\n\n102\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.700\nNow, what I wanna do,\nis I need to make that rules file,\n\n103\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.260\ncuz I pointed it to a file\nthat doesn't exist yet.\n\n104\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.120\nSo let's make that.\n\n105\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.340\nLet's do nano or ano.\n\n106\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.725\nWe'll do nano, nano.\n\n107\n00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:21.830\n[LAUGH] And we're gonna call this\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n108\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.280\ndo like a robot arm when you say that.\n\n109\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.850\n&gt;&gt; Do I?\n\n110\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Nano, nano.\n\n111\n00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.353\n&gt;&gt; Nano, nano, nano, sorry.\n\n112\n00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:29.027\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n113\n00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.299\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n114\n00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:32.919\nicmp-test.rules.\n\n115\n00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.038\nI need to make sure I name it whatever\nI told the configuration file to look\n\n116\n00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.190\nfor, right?\n\n117\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.290\nThat's what it's gonna look for.\n\n118\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.070\nAnd then I'm gonna write my rule.\n\n119\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.280\nAnd the rules are, I will say,\nthis one is gonna be relatively simple.\n\n120\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.420\nThey can get extremely complex.\n\n121\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.190\nI have seen books on snort and\nsnort rules that are over that thick.\n\n122\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.880\nSo especially if you can do\nan intrusion prevention system,\n\n123\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.040\nwhere not only do I have to write\nrules for what to look for, but\n\n124\n00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.580\nthen what to do in the event that\none of these gets triggered.\n\n125\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.030\nSo, I can get very very complex, and this\nis the great thing about having community\n\n126\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.110\nsupport, or\nif you go with a commercial paid solution.\n\n127\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.240\nAll right.\nSo anyway,\n\n128\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.970\nmy rule is simply gonna be, alert that's\ntelling it what category, where to log it.\n\n129\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.470\nI wanna put it in the alerts log,\nand I'm gonna call this one ICMP,\n\n130\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.790\nwhere we're looking for ICMP packets.\n\n131\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.420\nRight, so\nanything that's an ICMP protocol.\n\n132\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.630\nThat's where I'm actually specifying\ntheprotocol of the packet.\n\n133\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.720\nSo it'll be looking at the packets,\nand if it sees a packet go by,\n\n134\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.580\nwith a protocol of ICMP,\nthat's gonna trigger this.\n\n135\n00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.280\nWell, that's the first part of the rule,\nthat's gonna match that.\n\n136\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.020\nAnd then, I'm gonna do any, any,\nthis is gonna be my source.\n\n137\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.650\nAll right?\n\n138\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.880\nAnd it's IP address and then port.\n\n139\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.509\nSo it could be an IP range, like a whole\nsubnet address, you know, cider notation,\n\n140\n00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.090\n198.168.0.0/24, or\nit could be a single IP address.\n\n141\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.360\nAnd then port number.\n\n142\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.740\nIt could be a range of port numbers,\na single port number, or in my case, any.\n\n143\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.080\nSo, I'm leaving this one wide open,\njust to make it very simple to work with.\n\n144\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.107\nSo, any IP address,\nany port number, going to,\n\n145\n00:07:12.107 --> 00:07:17.280\nand I'll do a little -&gt; a little arrow,\nany any.\n\n146\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.020\nAnd again,\nmaybe I want to be more specific.\n\n147\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.010\nI only need to know if somebody's\ntrying to ping my file server or\n\n148\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.170\nmy database server, right?\n\n149\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.440\nI'm just keeping it very wide open for\nthis example.\n\n150\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.860\nAnd then open parentheses, msg colon, and\n\n151\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.370\nthen whatever in the entry in\nthe log you want it to say.\n\n152\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.860\nThis is things I can use when I go back\nto do my correlation, do my filtering.\n\n153\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.050\nAll right,\nthis is what I'm gonna see in the message.\n\n154\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.550\nSo I wanna put something in here that's\ngonna be meaningful that'll allow me to go\n\n155\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.270\nback and process this information.\n\n156\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.280\nI'm simply gonna put ICMP Packet for\nthis little test that we're doing.\n\n157\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.764\nI'll end my quote, I'll put a semicolon.\n\n158\n00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:58.185\nSo I've got my message colon and\nin quotes the actual message semicolon.\n\n159\n00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:01.963\nThere's two more values I wanna put\ninside these parentheses One is gonna be\n\n160\n00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:05.045\nthe snort ID, and\nthe other's gonna be the revision number.\n\n161\n00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:08.783\nThe snort ID or SID,\nwhich is really confusing for\n\n162\n00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:14.630\nus Windows people, but\nthis is not a SID, security identifier.\n\n163\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.566\nIt's a snort ID We can use\nreally any number, but\n\n164\n00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:25.094\nwe should start with a million, because\nI can't remember the exact break down,\n\n165\n00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:30.086\nbut the first 100 I think\nare already registered by Snort,\n\n166\n00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:34.886\nthe program itself, and\nthen they've left a lot of room for\n\n167\n00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:40.580\npre-defined, pre-built rules\nthat come in with your system.\n\n168\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.550\nSo all of those already have\nan ID assigned to them.\n\n169\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.300\nSo what you wanna do is just go\nup to a million and start there,\n\n170\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.610\nthat's best practices from Snort.\n\n171\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.950\nSo we'll do one million and one.\n\n172\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.360\nDid I do that right?\n\n173\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.100\nYeah that's 1 million and 1.\n\n174\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.890\nOkay, semi colon and then what I would do\nif these were my custom rules I'd start\n\n175\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.220\nthere 1 million 1,\n1 million 2 and etc., etc.\n\n176\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.770\nAnd then the last is rev colon, for\n\n177\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.340\nrevision number not all that,\nwell I shouldn't say it's not important.\n\n178\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.200\nWhat this is is really used internally,\nif I go back and\n\n179\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.800\nmodify this rule later I might change\nit to revision two or revision three.\n\n180\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.720\nThis is for change management because\nI'm gonna want to keep track of\n\n181\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.880\nas I change these rules I need to remember\nwhat I change, when I changed it.\n\n182\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.440\nAll of a sudden I start getting\na lot of false positives or\n\n183\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.080\neven worse false negatives.\n\n184\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.980\nMaybe I did something as a rule that\nwasn't so good and I need to go back and\n\n185\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.960\nchange it.\n\n186\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.560\nHow do I know what version\nof the rule worked?\n\n187\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.940\nWell, we didn't have these issues\nwhen we were on revision two.\n\n188\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.440\nYou moved us to revision three,\nyou changed something in there, and\n\n189\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.830\nMike you goofed it all up so\nlet's go back to revision two.\n\n190\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.040\nSo just to help us keep track of\nwhat's going on and that's it.\n\n191\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.081\nI'll go ahead and save that file.\n\n192\n00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:59.420\nAnd now we have our two files, right.\n\n193\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.950\nSo we've got a very simple configuration\nthat says include this set of rules.\n\n194\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.820\nAnd then my set of rules\ncontains one rule, looking for\n\n195\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:11.010\nICM packets from any to any\nlogin entry in the alerts log.\n\n196\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.240\nAll right, now that we've got\nall that set up we run Snort.\n\n197\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.860\nThe command to run Snort is simply Snort,\nI don't have to do an,\n\n198\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.940\nlet me double check my interfaces\nhere make sure we're still on if 0,\n\n199\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.130\nwhich we are So my is gonna be snort-i.\n\n200\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.530\nI only have one interface so\nI can probably leave dash i off.\n\n201\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.330\n&gt;&gt; You're just justifying that?\n\n202\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you had more than one you can specify.\n\n203\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:44.160\nYou might have a management\ninterface going to that IDS machine.\n\n204\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.270\nAnd you don't really need it\nlistening on that one for example,\n\n205\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.100\nyou want it listening on the one\nthat's attached to the port mirror\n\n206\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.842\non your switch.\n\n207\n00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:54.740\nIt tells what interface you want, and\nthen a -c for the configuration file.\n\n208\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.750\nAnd that's gonna be at c/snort,\nwhat did we call it?\n\n209\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.700\nicmp rules, icmp-test.rules.\n\n210\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.570\nActually, I'm sorry, that's my,\nwhat did we call it?\n\n211\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.180\nWe called it, snort-test, sorry.\n\n212\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.225\nI was like, what did we call it?\n\n213\n00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:13.880\nsnort-test.com, that's\nthe configuration file.\n\n214\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.290\nAnd that's the one that's gonna\npoint to the icmp-test.rules.\n\n215\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.955\nAnd then for the -log, or\n-l, for my log location,\n\n216\n00:11:23.955 --> 00:11:28.800\n/var/log/snort will put\nin that default location.\n\n217\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.770\nAnd we should be good to go,\nwe'll hit Enter.\n\n218\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.900\nAnd there it goes, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:40.250\nIt is now capturing packets, you can thumb\nback up through here and you can see\n\n220\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.130\nlike I said this is an incredibly simple\nconfiguration file so you don't see a lot.\n\n221\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.290\nBut it'll normally tell you hey\nloading up these rules, these rules,\n\n222\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.210\nthese rules, if there were any issues\nstarting it up, things like that.\n\n223\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.400\nI do like my little asky pig that\nthey've got right there, that's so cute.\n\n224\n00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah he's cute.\nI wanna real pig.\n\n225\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.640\n&gt;&gt; You want little one of those\nlittle tiny Vietnamese pot bellies.\n\n226\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I do, but they get big.\n\n227\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I had a friend that thought he got\none of those little miniature pigs and\n\n228\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.810\na few years later you\nrealize that it’s not.\n\n229\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it ended up getting as big as this\n\n230\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.280\ndarn table\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n231\n00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.880\nI had one that grew up to\nthree hundred pounds so.\n\n232\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.780\n&gt;&gt; And they make great guard dogs.\n\n233\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.980\nI mean this thing would sit\nunder my friend’s trailer, and\n\n234\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.350\nyou wouldn’t even know it was there until\nyou got close and it would come up and\n\n235\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.315\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn’t want one after me.\n\n236\n00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:27.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It’s a little intimidating.\n\n237\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.247\nThey are large animals.\n\n238\n00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Anyway sorry, and digress,\nback to, we'll get off pigs and\n\n239\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.150\ntalk about snort the only pig\nthat should matter in this show.\n\n240\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.990\nSo let's flip over to another machine.\n\n241\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.700\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n242\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:45.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm simply gonna ping that Cali\nmachine that's running Snort, all right.\n\n243\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.520\nSo we'll let that go for a second.\n\n244\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.480\nWe'll flip back over to,\nnot to the webpage but to Cali.\n\n245\n00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.180\nAll right, now it's giving me some\nwarnings about pre-processors.\n\n246\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.600\nI haven't loaded up any pre-processors,\nagain very small config file.\n\n247\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.500\nPre-processors help it filter out some of\nthe traffic, if you're looking for SMTP,\n\n248\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.060\nyou might put pre-processors that say, you\nknow only if it's SMTP in this or that.\n\n249\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.580\nSo just a set of rules\nthat can help with that.\n\n250\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.980\nFor us though let's do let me see,\noops not from this window, Mike.\n\n251\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.260\nActually I can kill Snort at this point.\n\n252\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.960\nWe don't need it anymore.\n\n253\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.040\nSo we'll control c for killing Snort.\n\n254\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.290\nNormally I'd launch that\nas a background process and\n\n255\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.010\nthat would just continue to run.\n\n256\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.580\nOnce you stop it you can scroll\nback up and you can see statistics,\n\n257\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.700\npackets per minute, some total usage IO,\nbreakdown by protocol,\n\n258\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:47.270\nand hopefully we'll see\nsome ICMP discards.\n\n259\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.849\nI don't see any ICMP's there we go.\n\n260\n00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:50.008\nShoo, I was like, boy,\n\n261\n00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:54.120\nthis is a waste of a lab if we didn't\nget any ICMP packets in there all right.\n\n262\n00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.890\nNow let's go check out the alert.\n\n263\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:01.704\nLet's cat the log which we stuck in\n\n264\n00:14:01.704 --> 00:14:07.380\nwhat var log alert, right?\n\n265\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.430\nNo.\nWhat do we call it?\n\n266\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.618\nSnort alert.\n\n267\n00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:15.840\nAll right, and there we go.\n\n268\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.810\nThis is the log entry, so\nthere's where I issued my command.\n\n269\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.363\nAnd I can see a few things of interest\nin here, one, notice my Snort Id,\n\n270\n00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:26.780\nthere's 1,000,001.\n\n271\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.390\nSo I can see what rule it is\n\n272\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.190\nthat caused this packet to be\nlogged in this particular log file.\n\n273\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.890\nI can see the message that I typed in,\nright.\n\n274\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.922\nAnd then I can see the source address\nof where it came from, the destination,\n\n275\n00:14:42.922 --> 00:14:46.950\nwhere it was going to, and then of course\na little bit information about the type of\n\n276\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:53.340\nICMP, time synchronization, time request,\nor this was an echo request or type eight.\n\n277\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:15:00.430\nAnd then I can see the echo reply,\nfrom my Cali box back to the source,\n\n278\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.430\nand then of course Windows by default\nsends four so I see four echo requests and\n\n279\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:10.970\nfour echo replies, and then I kill\nSnort and so it would stop logging.\n\n280\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.954\nBut there you go very simple demonstration\non how you can setup an IDS to monitor.\n\n281\n00:15:14.954 --> 00:15:15.955\n&gt;&gt; Free.\n\n282\n00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:19.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah free ideas to monitor traffic.\n\n283\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.410\nYou make your rules and\nthen you fire it up and it does its thing.\n\n284\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.550\nAnd then you have to periodically,\nyou have to continuously review these.\n\n285\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.130\nNow real quick before we move\ninto honey pots, I will show you,\n\n286\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.115\nshould be in here, let's take a look\nat a actual configuration file.\n\n287\n00:15:34.115 --> 00:15:38.310\nCuz I don't want you to think like hey all\nyou have to do is type one line include,\n\n288\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.065\nmake one little rule and you're good\nto go, and your network will be safe.\n\n289\n00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:44.349\nLet's cat that snort.com.\n\n290\n00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike you mentioned the community\nthe different forms available out there.\n\n291\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.520\nAre these configuration\nfiles available for\n\n292\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.890\ndownload or\njust have you created them yourself?\n\n293\n00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:53.733\nWhere did you get that?\n\n294\n00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:55.402\n&gt;&gt; This one actually came with Snort.\n\n295\n00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:59.305\nBut then once you sign up for\nthe community addition you get a You get\n\n296\n00:15:59.305 --> 00:16:02.387\naccess to the community and\nthey'll create rules.\n\n297\n00:16:02.387 --> 00:16:05.513\nAnd you usually just add\nto this configuration.\n\n298\n00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:09.570\nThe configuration file\nis very well commented.\n\n299\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.300\nA lot of things are commented out,\nif they're not necessary,\n\n300\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.540\nyou can come in here and what you have\nto do, when you first set up snort,\n\n301\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.020\nis just sit here and go through this file.\n\n302\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.850\nIt's like I said,\nit's very well commented,\n\n303\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.970\nthere's great help on the snort page.\n\n304\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.881\nAnd you can take a look at What you might\nor might not want to change in this file.\n\n305\n00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:31.265\nBut you can see as I scroll\nthrough it one is pretty long,\n\n306\n00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:34.450\ntwo they give you instructions right here.\n\n307\n00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.644\nThese are the things that you will\nneed to do to create your own config,\n\n308\n00:16:37.644 --> 00:16:41.709\nset your network variables, configure your\ndecoders, configure the base detection,\n\n309\n00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.311\nconfigure your pre processors, your\nrule set, your shared object rule set.\n\n310\n00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:49.912\nAnd then this was step one, and\nthen right down here, I can see, look,\n\n311\n00:16:49.912 --> 00:16:53.160\nhere's step one set the network variables.\n\n312\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.600\nAnd this allows you to specify\nwhat you're protected.\n\n313\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.840\nIn this case, home net is the network\nyou're trying to protect all right?\n\n314\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.298\nAnd so when I'm writing my rules,\nI can use variables,\n\n315\n00:17:04.298 --> 00:17:06.147\ninstead of actual IP ranges.\n\n316\n00:17:06.147 --> 00:17:09.227\nSo I can define it once in the comp file,\nand\n\n317\n00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:12.630\nthen reuse that variable within my rules.\n\n318\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.510\nThat way if I have to update things,\nif our subnet changes, or\n\n319\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.060\nif I wanna take this configuration\nto another location and use it,\n\n320\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.490\nlike at a branch office,\nall I have to do is modify the variable.\n\n321\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.480\nThe rules will still work cuz the rules\nsay, any packets that are ICMP instead\n\n322\n00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.940\nof saying any, any it would say home_net\nany for any IP address in this range.\n\n323\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.475\nSo just an example again\nwe're not here to learn-\n\n324\n00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:37.050\n&gt;&gt; Stores.\n\n325\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.511\nHow to configure stores exactly.\n\n326\n00:17:38.511 --> 00:17:40.350\nThat could take us a long time.\n\n327\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.420\nThe other thing I'll just point out\nreal quick is if I scroll down,\n\n328\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.870\nwe'll see once I get to the rules section.\n\n329\n00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:52.240\nThere we go.\n\n330\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.650\nYou can see it's including some rules.\n\n331\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.236\nThese rules that don't have a pound\nsymbol in front of them all right.\n\n332\n00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:00.430\nIt's actually gonna load those up.\n\n333\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.256\nIt's gonna look in the variable rule path,\nwhich is defined as etsy,\n\n334\n00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:07.382\nsnort rules right?\n\n335\n00:18:07.382 --> 00:18:11.200\nBut these others that have a pound in\nfront of them it's not including them.\n\n336\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.470\nSo if I went and\nwanted to use that blacklist.rules,\n\n337\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.900\nI would just take\nthe pound sign out of here.\n\n338\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.380\nOf course I have to get in my editor.\n\n339\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.768\nBut I can just remove move the pound\nsign it could uncomment those lines and\n\n340\n00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:23.871\nit would include them.\n\n341\n00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.889\nSo the configuration file, and\n\n342\n00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:30.400\nthe last thing I will show you here\nis going to be some of the rules.\n\n343\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:37.180\nLet's do, what do we got, that's in\nthat rules folder, and let's look for,\n\n344\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:43.320\nthey've got some IPMC rules I know,\nSomething, there's ICMP info rules.\n\n345\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.620\nThere's one in there.\n\n346\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.920\nHere's a simple example of some ICMP.\n\n347\n00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.271\nThis is their default ICMP intro.\n\n348\n00:18:49.271 --> 00:18:49.930\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n349\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nthere's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n350\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.420\nBut you can see like this first one.\n\n351\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.490\nOnce we learn that rule\nthat I just showed you,\n\n352\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.640\nyou guys could decipher this yourself,\nright.\n\n353\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.430\nAlert, now you know what\nlog it's going into.\n\n354\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:07.610\nProtocol ICMP okay we knew that,\nand it says from external net,\n\n355\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.620\nyou guys can probably guess that's\na variable from the configuration file.\n\n356\n00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.095\nAnd normally we leave external net\nas blank or 000 anything that's\n\n357\n00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:23.288\nnot home net basically, and\nthen any port going to home net any port\n\n358\n00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:28.978\nI want you to put ICMPIRDP router\nadvertisement if it's an ICMP type 9.\n\n359\n00:19:28.978 --> 00:19:31.370\nWhat else can we see?\n\n360\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.420\nThere's a reference.\n\n361\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:37.050\nYou can see this is we only included\nthe sid and the rev in our rule but\n\n362\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.350\nnotice they're putting references so\n\n363\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.730\nthey can actually in the message if\nsomebody else is looking at that log.\n\n364\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.915\nThey can say, what is this?\n\n365\n00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:48.317\nBug track 578, they can go out,\nbreak out their search engine,\n\n366\n00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:50.000\nfind information about that.\n\n367\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.238\nSo a lot of cool things you can do, but\nI wanted to show you this is just one of\n\n368\n00:19:53.238 --> 00:19:55.926\nthe several rules sheets that\nthey have in there by default.\n\n369\n00:19:55.926 --> 00:20:00.450\nAnd you can see they can be expensive.\n\n370\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.910\nYou get into the IPS rules, and\nthey start getting really complex.\n\n371\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.740\nAll right, so good for that.\n\n372\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.048\nThat is our demo for\nyour intrusion prevention system.\n\n373\n00:20:10.048 --> 00:20:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n374\n00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.730\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, intrusion detection systems.\n\n375\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.592\nLet's finish off this episode\ntalking about honey pots.\n\n376\n00:20:16.592 --> 00:20:17.267\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm hungry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:17.767\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:20.026\n&gt;&gt; I know many of you out there we need\n\n379\n00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:21.889\nthe prove and trigger too.\n\n380\n00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:24.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:27.183\n&gt;&gt; Honeypots are a very interesting thing,\n\n382\n00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:28.690\nthey're really cool.\n\n383\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.130\nA honey pot is just a way to,\nwell they have several uses right.\n\n384\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.662\nWhen we think about a honeypot,\n\n385\n00:20:35.662 --> 00:20:38.572\nwhat we're really trying to do\nis attract attackers right.\n\n386\n00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:41.210\nYou think about it,\nyou put the honeypots out right.\n\n387\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.830\nThat's the I hesitate\nto use the word bait,\n\n388\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.070\nbecause that can imply\nsome legal considerations.\n\n389\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.760\nBut you really are.\n\n390\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.519\nYou're setting out the honey to try to\nattract things, like bears or flies.\n\n391\n00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.810\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a moral.\n\n392\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:59.070\nI've heard people discuss and\ndebate on whether network admins or\n\n393\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.930\nnetwork engineers should\neven consider using them.\n\n394\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.710\nBut you know what, I say go for it.\n\n395\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.130\nIf there are attackers out there,\nwhy not protect yourself?\n\n396\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.720\nYou know what I mean?\n\n397\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n398\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.650\nAnd what you they're worried\nabout is entrapment.\n\n399\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.206\nAnd when start looking about the laws for\nentrapment, in the U.S. anyway.\n\n400\n00:21:15.206 --> 00:21:19.100\nLet's make sure I'm only talking about\nU.S. I don't know the other laws.\n\n401\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.790\nThe law says,\nif a law enforcement officer coerces\n\n402\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.570\nsomebody to take part\nin an illegal activity.\n\n403\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.750\nWell, we can stop right there.\n\n404\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.390\nCherokee, are you a law\nenforcement officer?\n\n405\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.443\n&gt;&gt; I am not\n&gt;&gt; Neither am I, so\n\n406\n00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:35.810\ndont have to worry about intrapet do we?\n\n407\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.548\nI mean honestly, now until the laws are\nstill catching up with the digital age, so\n\n408\n00:21:40.548 --> 00:21:42.882\nthere could be more to that eventually,\n\n409\n00:21:42.882 --> 00:21:47.002\nmight even be some things around\nthe book that I dont know about yet, but\n\n410\n00:21:47.002 --> 00:21:51.420\nthat's basically were we can stop as\nwe are not law enforcement personnel.\n\n411\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.880\nNow there are some moral\nimplications you know?\n\n412\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.220\nAre we enticing them But honestly,\n\n413\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.500\nwhen you're setting up a honeypot,\nyou're putting it inside your network.\n\n414\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.645\nThey're breaking into your network.\n\n415\n00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:05.170\nAll I'm trying to do is attract them\naway from my production servers.\n\n416\n00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.640\nSo they're gonna break into my network\nwhether I had the honeypot there or\n\n417\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.510\nnot, right?\n\n418\n00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.490\nNow there are some that are out on the\ninternet that are catching traffic that\n\n419\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.120\nmaybe they could be considered.\n\n420\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.136\nBut again, as far as the law is concerned\ncurrently, if you're not law enforcement,\n\n421\n00:22:19.136 --> 00:22:22.998\nthen you cannot participate in entrapment\nor you can't be accused of entrapment.\n\n422\n00:22:22.998 --> 00:22:26.870\nBut anyway, that aside,\nlet's talk about it.\n\n423\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:32.720\nSo honey pots are used for\ntwo reasons, for research and\n\n424\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.770\nfor\n&gt;&gt; Slowing down an attack?\n\n425\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.272\n&gt;&gt; Well, or for deterring attacks or\ndrawing attacks away from or slowing down.\n\n426\n00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:44.350\n&gt;&gt; To prevent one from\npotentially occurring.\n\n427\n00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; They're pre-occupied with your decoy\n\n428\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.350\nBastion Host, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n429\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.510\nAnd it may give you an edge up to kind\nof understand their attack style so that\n\n430\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.120\nyou can build up your internal defenses\nand give yourself enough time there.\n\n431\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.640\nKind of like a war tactic or\nsomething like that right?\n\n432\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.459\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact one of the things\nI threw down in my notes just for\n\n433\n00:23:03.459 --> 00:23:04.880\nfun's sake cuz I like Sun Tzu.\n\n434\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.733\nThere can never be enough\ndeception is the quote.\n\n435\n00:23:07.733 --> 00:23:08.732\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, is that from the Art of War?\n\n436\n00:23:08.732 --> 00:23:09.821\n&gt;&gt; That is from the Art of War.\n\n437\n00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.553\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there can never be enough deception.\n\n438\n00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:17.672\nAnd that's Really what we are trying to do\nat honeypot then is a machine that we put\n\n439\n00:23:17.672 --> 00:23:21.428\non our network that is designed to look\nlike any of our other machines on our\n\n440\n00:23:21.428 --> 00:23:22.340\nnetwork.\n\n441\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.976\nAlso designed to be a little more\nvulnerable or look vulnerable\n\n442\n00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:29.970\nto the attacker and look like a juicy\ntarget that they wanna go after.\n\n443\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.156\nAnd so the idea is,\nthat's what they are gonna attack.\n\n444\n00:23:33.156 --> 00:23:36.420\nCuz attackers are gonna go for the low\nhanging fruit, always gonna start with\n\n445\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.930\nthe easy stuff or things that jump out at\nus And then maybe use that to pivot off\n\n446\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.350\nof, later but we'll definitely start\nwith the ones that we see that are easy.\n\n447\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.870\nSo that's what a honeypot is for.\n\n448\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.413\nAnd they're loaded to the gills\nwith monitoring software,\n\n449\n00:23:52.413 --> 00:23:56.731\nevery type of forensic software you\ncan think of, is gonna be put on here.\n\n450\n00:23:56.731 --> 00:24:01.711\nEvery type of logging is gonna be turned\non and ultimate verbose mode, all of that.\n\n451\n00:24:01.711 --> 00:24:05.274\nSo that I can capture as much\ninformation as I can About the attack.\n\n452\n00:24:05.274 --> 00:24:06.888\nAnd the idea is that I can learn.\n\n453\n00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:09.672\nI can learn their methods,\nwhat tricks they're using,\n\n454\n00:24:09.672 --> 00:24:13.900\nwhat tools they're using to help better\ndefend my network from these attacks.\n\n455\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.120\nIt also, as Cherokee was saying,\n\n456\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.130\ncan be a deterrent or a decoy,\nI think was the word you used.\n\n457\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.970\nBecause while they're busy attacking that,\nmaybe my IDSs go off.\n\n458\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.720\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nI can shut this attack down.\n\n459\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.060\nIf I'm not trying to learn from it,\nI can shut it down and\n\n460\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.005\nthey never got any real information.\n\n461\n00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:36.915\nBecause all of the healthcare information\nthat was on that honey pot was fake.\n\n462\n00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:38.880\nIt was Charlie Brown and Luke Skywalker.\n\n463\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.515\nNow if you use names like that,\nthey're gonna know that it's fake and\n\n464\n00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.495\nthey're gonna move on,\nso I say that in jest,\n\n465\n00:24:44.495 --> 00:24:47.645\nbut that's the idea is that we're\ngonna put false information.\n\n466\n00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:51.775\nYou can't just take a machine,\nset it on your network unpatched\n\n467\n00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:56.020\nrunning Server 2000, firewalls turned off-\n&gt;&gt; Too obvious?\n\n468\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.582\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit, right.\n\n469\n00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:57.472\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n470\n00:24:57.472 --> 00:25:00.448\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna go,\nhmm I wonder what that is.\n\n471\n00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:04.490\nAnd they're gonna realize it's a honey\npot, they're gonna stay away from it and\n\n472\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.930\ngo and attack other machines or\njust leave your network.\n\n473\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:08.991\nI mean, if they leave your network,\nthat could be a good thing.\n\n474\n00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:10.262\n&gt;&gt; Good to go, yeah.\n\n475\n00:25:10.262 --> 00:25:13.631\n&gt;&gt; But if you're trying to capture\ndetails so that you can prosecute or\n\n476\n00:25:13.631 --> 00:25:16.980\ndefend your network,\nI need them to stick to that honey pot.\n\n477\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.339\nI don't want them hitting the honey\npot going ew, this is a honey pot.\n\n478\n00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:22.628\nI mean, this one's not, let me get this.\n\n479\n00:25:22.628 --> 00:25:26.949\nBut we'll put it,\nwe might have servers at 10.1, 10.2, 10.3,\n\n480\n00:25:26.949 --> 00:25:31.735\nmy honey pot's 10.4, and then the rest\nof them are 10.5, 10.6 and so on.\n\n481\n00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:35.410\nSo you try to mix it in, you don't\nmake it obvious that it's a honey pot.\n\n482\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.940\nYou put fake data on there\nthat looks realistic.\n\n483\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.470\nIf I'm a healthcare provider,\nI don't put financial data on there,\n\n484\n00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.610\nI put healthcare information on there.\n\n485\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.590\nMake it look like the real thing,\ndeter those attacks.\n\n486\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.930\nPull them away from your\nproduction servers.\n\n487\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.440\nYou get information on their\nmethodology that you're using.\n\n488\n00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.250\nLike I said, they're configured to be\nvulnerable but not too vulnerable.\n\n489\n00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.640\nYou can build your own,\nthere are many out there.\n\n490\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.039\nYou can go to honey, what is it,\nhoneynet.org or honey project.\n\n491\n00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:08.900\nThere's several of them out there that\nyou can download that are pre-built.\n\n492\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.040\nYou can also do honey networks,\nwhich are entire virtual networks,\n\n493\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.920\nnot just one machine that\ncan offer services and\n\n494\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.960\nprovide services to the other\nmachines on your honey net.\n\n495\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.740\nCuz that's one thing you'll find in a\nhoney pot might be offering services, but\n\n496\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.830\nnobody's using them.\n\n497\n00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.010\nBecause your users, you have to control.\n\n498\n00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.330\nMake sure your users aren't\nhitting your honey pot, right?\n\n499\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.230\nYou don't want that to happen because\nthen they can become a target off of\n\n500\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.280\nthe honey pot.\n\n501\n00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.140\nYou also have to make sure that\nyour honey pot cannot get out.\n\n502\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.460\nPeople are gonna attack your honey pot,\n\n503\n00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.380\nthey're gonna compromise it because\nit's intentionally vulnerable.\n\n504\n00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.960\nYou don't want that being a platform\nof attack for the rest of your network.\n\n505\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.170\nSo you have to have really secure rules.\n\n506\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.357\n&gt;&gt; Fully segmented?\n\n507\n00:26:50.357 --> 00:26:53.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there needs to be a firewall\nbetween your honey pot and the network.\n\n508\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.410\nYou need to make sure that\nthere are rules that say yes,\n\n509\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.100\nit can talk to the outside maybe.\n\n510\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.977\nBut nobody on the intranet,\nnone of the other servers.\n\n511\n00:26:59.977 --> 00:27:02.650\nI mean,\nyou really have to tighten this down.\n\n512\n00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:07.890\nAnother thing you have to worry about is\nusing it as an attack platform, right?\n\n513\n00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.550\nThis is where again some of the legal\nquestions come into play with honey pots\n\n514\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.390\nand honey nets.\n\n515\n00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.058\nI'm setting up this honey pot\nto do what we've talked about.\n\n516\n00:27:17.058 --> 00:27:22.520\nAn attacker compromises it, I know he's in\nthere, but I don't do anything about it.\n\n517\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.260\nBecause I want to log as much information\nas I can, so I can prosecute him later.\n\n518\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.890\nOr so I can do research on\nhis attack methodology.\n\n519\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:29.530\nSo I let him go.\n\n520\n00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.120\nAnd in the meantime,\n\n521\n00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:37.390\nhe uses my honey net platform to launch\nan attack against another organization.\n\n522\n00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.910\nNow that organization is facing downtime,\nthey were under attack.\n\n523\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:46.168\nThey're gonna come back to me and say\nit's because you facilitated his attack.\n\n524\n00:27:46.168 --> 00:27:49.970\nYou gave him a platform to\nlaunch the attack against us.\n\n525\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.220\nAnd so now there might be some\nlegal ramifications against me.\n\n526\n00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.730\nSo things you gotta think about\nwhen you're setting these up.\n\n527\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.130\nLast thing I'll say is honey tokens.\n\n528\n00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:04.680\nThis is a term that really just refers\nto the information on a honey pot.\n\n529\n00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.760\nSo anything other than the honey pot\nitself could be considered a honey token.\n\n530\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.270\nWe might put usernames and\npasswords in there.\n\n531\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.150\nFiles with usernames and passwords,\nemail addresses on web pages.\n\n532\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.574\nAnd they're fake,\nthey're all fake usernames and passwords,\n\n533\n00:28:18.574 --> 00:28:19.828\nthey're fake email addresses.\n\n534\n00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:22.139\nBut when that person steals\nthose credentials and\n\n535\n00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:25.495\nthen tries to connect to one of my web\nservers using those credentials and\n\n536\n00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:29.230\nthose credentials are now logged,\nI know where he got them from, right?\n\n537\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.861\nSo it's a way to track the activity of\nthis attacker as he goes through your\n\n538\n00:28:32.861 --> 00:28:36.720\nnetwork by putting these little honey\ntokens all over your honey pot.\n\n539\n00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.160\nAnd then he tries to use those elsewhere,\nwe can where they're going and\n\n540\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.860\nwhat they're doing.\n\n541\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Interesting terminology there,\nour little use of the word token there.\n\n542\n00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.527\nA honey, what did you say?\n\n543\n00:28:47.527 --> 00:28:50.722\n&gt;&gt; Honey token.\n&gt;&gt; Honey token, I like it, yeah.\n\n544\n00:28:50.722 --> 00:28:52.970\nYou gotta be key to some of these terms.\n\n545\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.610\nActually, someone here in the chat\nthey said put it in the DMZ\n\n546\n00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.135\nabout our honey pots and\nhoney nets for our demilitarized zone.\n\n547\n00:28:59.135 --> 00:29:04.272\nI've also seen the term screen subnet,\nso just depending on which vendor or\n\n548\n00:29:04.272 --> 00:29:07.170\nwhom you're talking to, they might\ncall it something different there.\n\n549\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.714\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely, and you're very right,\n\n550\n00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:10.965\nDavid I think put that comment out there,\nDavid Beam.\n\n551\n00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:13.470\nThat's a great place, it depends on\nwhat you're trying to capture, right?\n\n552\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.934\nIf you're trying to capture attacks\nthat are taking place from the external,\n\n553\n00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:21.938\nfrom the untrusted into your network,\nyou might put it out in the DMZ.\n\n554\n00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:23.720\nYou might have another one internal.\n\n555\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.460\nWhat if somebody does make it through your\nfirewall and into your internal network?\n\n556\n00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.270\nAnd now they've scanned your network and\nthey're prioritizing their targets.\n\n557\n00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.910\nMaybe you want that honey\npot there to attract them,\n\n558\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.290\nhopefully set off some IDS before they\nmake their way to the real servers, right.\n\n559\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.190\nSo you might have more than one running.\n\n560\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.480\nJust understand that you don't\ntake a honey pot, set it up and\n\n561\n00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.670\nforget about it, right.\n\n562\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.330\nThinking there we go, that's my trap,\n\n563\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.520\nall the bad guys will stick to it\nlike flypaper and we're good to go.\n\n564\n00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.054\nYou have to monitor it continuously.\n\n565\n00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:59.374\nOtherwise, it just becomes an attack\nplatform that they can launch attacks from\n\n566\n00:29:59.374 --> 00:30:02.920\non the rest of your network or\nother organizations.\n\n567\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.705\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you've done a really\ngreat job in the past couple of episodes.\n\n568\n00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:08.665\nWe started with the perimeter, and\nwe're even still talking about it.\n\n569\n00:30:08.665 --> 00:30:12.545\nBut you've also explained the different\ndeployment styles depending on placement\n\n570\n00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:15.575\nand different areas that we\nmight wanna conceal or protect.\n\n571\n00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:18.765\nSo thank you for that and thank you\nladies and gentlemen for tuning in.\n\n572\n00:30:18.765 --> 00:30:21.655\nBut stay tuned,\nwe do have more information to cover.\n\n573\n00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:23.545\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for this show.\n\n574\n00:30:23.545 --> 00:30:24.865\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n575\n00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:25.675\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n576\n00:30:25.675 --> 00:30:28.964\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n577\n00:30:28.964 -->

[CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.978\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.830\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials Series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.040\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boost.\n\n6\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.820\nIn this episode we'll be\nlooking at access controls.\n\n7\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.290\nWhile the concept seems simple,\n\n8\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.780\nthere are really several different\nways we can implement access controls.\n\n9\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.550\nSo with us today we have Mr. Mike Rodrick\nin studio to explain those techniques.\n\n10\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.970\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.250\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.070\nExcited as always.\n\n13\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.400\nAll right, so access control.\n\n14\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.730\nWe're gonna talk about a little bit\nof theory here, and eventually we'll\n\n15\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.430\ncome up with a couple demos and\nmaybe the next part two on this guy.\n\n16\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.230\nBut we do need to start off with\nthat foundational knowledge.\n\n17\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.610\nWhat they're gonna test us on the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.170\nSo when we talk about\naccess control theory,\n\n19\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.180\nthere is a few different terms that\nwould need to be familiar with and\n\n20\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.968\nunderstand, some concepts\nthat are very important.\n\n21\n00:00:56.968 --> 00:01:02.930\nSo, access control kind of defines itself\nif you just reverse the words, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.030\nWe're gonna control access.\n\n23\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.930\nWho is allowed to access what?\n\n24\n00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.200\nWithout access control, we basically say,\nhey, anybody can access anything,\n\n25\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.728\nit's all good.\n\n26\n00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Free range!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna come and\n\n27\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.310\nsee Mike's health records.\n\n28\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.040\nThere you go, there they are, right?\n\n29\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.550\nBank statements, whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.177\n&gt;&gt; Obviously we don't-\n&gt;&gt; Very underwhelming\n\n31\n00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:22.260\nif you're trying to look\nat my info [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.220\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say mine, too.\n\n33\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.180\nLook he's got $200 in his bank account.\n\n34\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.150\nWoo woo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Moving on\n\n35\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n36\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.030\nwhen we talk about access control,\nobviously we are trying to control access.\n\n37\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.790\nAnd it's a very important\npart of what we do.\n\n38\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.260\nI mean, in IT, access control is one of\nour bigger jobs that we have to play.\n\n39\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.740\nAnd when it comes to IT security,\n\n40\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.810\nit's still a big part of what we do and\nin making sure that it's enforced,\n\n41\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.710\ndeciding how we're going\nto go about enforcing that.\n\n42\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.116\nWhat policies do we have in place?\n\n43\n00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:57.140\nWhat technologies are we using\nto do the access control?\n\n44\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.500\nWe might not be the ones that decide on\nsome of higher level policy stuff, but\n\n45\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990\nwe have to implement it, right?\n\n46\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.390\nThey come up with the policies, we're\nthe ones that enforce those policies.\n\n47\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.060\nSo let's start with data classification.\n\n48\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.940\nAnd data classification is\nsomething that more and\n\n49\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.020\nmore organizations are starting to do.\n\n50\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.150\nAnd it's a very good reason for that,\nbecause all of our resources that we have,\n\n51\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.300\nnot all of them need the same\nlevel of protection, right?\n\n52\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.130\nAnd we can't apply the same level\nof protection to everything.\n\n53\n00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.730\nIt's too resource intensive.\n\n54\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.650\nIt's too costly.\n\n55\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.410\nSo we want to make sure we're\nprioritizing and picking and\n\n56\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.870\nchoosing where we're\nimplementing these solutions.\n\n57\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.240\nCuz some things are meant for\npublic consumption, right?\n\n58\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.090\nSo we don't encrypt them.\n\n59\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.290\nWe don't put them behind firewalls.\n\n60\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.340\nWe don't password protect them,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n61\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.690\nOther things are, and we have to.\n\n62\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.870\nBut without data classification, I don't\nknow what needs what level of protection,\n\n63\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.720\nor it's a little bit of a guessing game,\nor a hit or miss type thing.\n\n64\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.310\nWhereas with property of classification,\n\n65\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.300\nit's obvious what level of\nprotection a certain resource needs.\n\n66\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.939\nBecause it's basically stamped on there,\nif you will, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.610\nSo data classification's important to\nensure that data is protected properly.\n\n68\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.300\nBecause we understand what level it is,\n\n69\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.545\nand therefore what level\nof protection it needs.\n\n70\n00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:21.210\nAnd it can also help us\nwith legal requirements\n\n71\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.770\nbecause our data classifications can\ninclude retention periods, encryption\n\n72\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.000\nrequirements, logging,\naccess, things like that.\n\n73\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000\nAnd just about every\nregulation that you go and\n\n74\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.860\nlook at is going to include clauses\nto cover this kind of thing,\n\n75\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.360\nfrom HIPAA, to FISMA,\nto SOX, Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n76\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.260\nYou name it,\n\n77\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.395\nthere's going to be information in there\nabout how long you need to keep stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.705\nIf it needs to be encrypted.\n\n79\n00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:54.615\nIf you need to log every bit of access\nthat goes to it, that kind of thing.\n\n80\n00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:57.425\nSo, classification can help with that.\n\n81\n00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:01.435\nWhen it comes to doing\nthe actual classification,\n\n82\n00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:05.245\nnow we have different levels that\nwe're gonna create basically.\n\n83\n00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.645\nThere are some out there that\nare kinda commonly used.\n\n84\n00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:13.750\nWe know in the military, for\nexample, we have like Top Secret and\n\n85\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.600\nSecret, or Confidential and\nClassified information.\n\n86\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.350\nAnd a lot of corporations,\nand some that, for example,\n\n87\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.460\nthat Sans will recommend, or NIST will\nrecommend for public organizations,\n\n88\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.950\npublic, internal,\nconfidential, restricted.\n\n89\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.700\nPublic would mean information\navailable to the general public.\n\n90\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.590\nThis might be my product catalog, right?\n\n91\n00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.350\nDescriptions of those products\nthat we're trying to sell,\n\n92\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.850\nor company background information.\n\n93\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.900\nThat kind of thing is publicly\navailable information.\n\n94\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.430\nSo it would be on our lowest\nlevel of protection requirements.\n\n95\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.420\nAnd then we would have Internal\nto designate stuff that\n\n96\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.690\nwasn't available to the public.\n\n97\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.600\nInternal would mean available to\nthe general employees of the organization.\n\n98\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.160\nAnybody in the organization can\nlook at our acceptable use policy.\n\n99\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.950\nThey need to.\nIn fact,\n\n100\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.910\nthey should have read it and signed it and\nit should be in their employee jacket.\n\n101\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.810\nSo that would be considered Internal.\n\n102\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.030\nIt's not meant for public consumption, but\n\n103\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.470\nwithin my organizationn anybody in the\norganization can access that information.\n\n104\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.600\nConfidential would mean\navailable internally,\n\n105\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.720\nbut only to certain groups\nwithin the organization like,\n\n106\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.440\nI don't know, prices for\nproducts or wholesale costs for\n\n107\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.990\nproducts that we're selling,\nmight be limited to sales personnel.\n\n108\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.770\nOr certain security documentation\nmight be limited to IT management or\n\n109\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.850\nthe C-level employees or\nsomething like that.\n\n110\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.840\nSo, still available internally,\nnot public.\n\n111\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.378\nBut now we're talking about\na subset of employees.\n\n112\n00:05:54.378 --> 00:05:58.470\nAnd so that'd be Confidential.\n\n113\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.260\nAnd then Restricted would be my highest\nlevel where now it's internally, but\n\n114\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.890\nonly named individuals, all right?\n\n115\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.840\nPay rates might only be\navailable to HR supervisor and\n\n116\n00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.130\nthe CEO and CIO or whomever.\n\n117\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.580\nBut now we're not talking groups\nof people, but named individuals.\n\n118\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.700\nThis is the highest level.\n\n119\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.940\nHere we're talking about corporate\nsecrets, intellectual property,\n\n120\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.545\nthat research project is only\navailable to the researcher and\n\n121\n00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:33.235\nhis assistant and the CEO and\n\n122\n00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:36.725\nher secretary so that she can get\nthe information and bring it to the CEO.\n\n123\n00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:40.675\nSo, while we're naming individual people.\n\n124\n00:06:40.675 --> 00:06:42.915\n&gt;&gt; And so, Mike,\nwe wanna make a designation for\n\n125\n00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.905\nthese particular classes or levels.\n\n126\n00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.160\nIf I were to write a very\nsensitive document to you,\n\n127\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.860\nI might even put a watermark on the back,\nthe actual template or whatever, so that\n\n128\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.300\nif we used to have these manilla folders\nwith the stamp confidential or whatever.\n\n129\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.160\nBut now that we have digitized\ninformation, we want to make sure\n\n130\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.220\nthat it's still relevant and\npeople are understanding that.\n\n131\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.040\nAnd that's something we\nsee on the private sector.\n\n132\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.200\nBut then if we talk about in the military\nhere in the United States, we might see\n\n133\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.950\nsomething like Secret, Top Secret, and the\nsame concept of those tiers being used.\n\n134\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.890\n&gt;&gt; I kinda miss the tape.\n\n135\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.550\nI wish we'd have to break open a seal\nto say, yeah, I feel important now.\n\n136\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.420\nBut yeah, absolutely right.\n\n137\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.330\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about,\neven the wax seals from back in the day.\n\n138\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.540\nSo this is not a new concept here,\nit's just a new way of implementing it.\n\n139\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and sometimes we implement\nwith different methods, like you said.\n\n140\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.370\nWatermarking documents or just controlling\naccess through permissions with\n\n141\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.970\nour discretionary access control.\n\n142\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.280\nWe'll talk about a couple of those\nmodels here in just a little bit.\n\n143\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.773\n&gt;&gt; Those watermarks will just keep\nthe honest people honest [CROSSTALK].\n\n144\n00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:46.909\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many times have you seen\nsomebody down at Kinko's copying something\n\n145\n00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.480\nthat says do not copy.\n\n146\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.750\nAnd the people at Kinko's don't care.\n\n147\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.835\nThey'll just copy it for you.\n\n148\n00:07:50.835 --> 00:07:52.704\nIt says Instructor Only.\n\n149\n00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:55.272\nBut you know, they don't care.\n\n150\n00:07:55.272 --> 00:07:57.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, all right, but it is a CYA thing,\n\n151\n00:07:57.886 --> 00:07:58.418\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:01.285\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now I can prosecute you because it does\n\n153\n00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:03.742\nsay on there Do not copy, I like that.\n\n154\n00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:08.810\nI've had keys, physical keys to locks\nthat say right on there do not copy.\n\n155\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.463\n&gt;&gt; Like postal keys, yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:11.401\n&gt;&gt; I go down to Home Depot and\n\n157\n00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:13.829\nI give it to the guy and\nhe's like yeah we got a key for that, zzz.\n\n158\n00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:17.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't even say anything so, and\n\n159\n00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:19.440\nagain, keeping the honest people honest.\n\n160\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.050\nBut anyway when we talk about dates and\n\n161\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.790\nclassification we talked about\nwhy we need to classify so\n\n162\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.480\nwe can control and not every bit of\ninformation has the same requirements.\n\n163\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.590\nSo we wanna be able to differentiate,\nwe wanna be able to categorize.\n\n164\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.350\nWe talked about the different levels or\ncategories that we might implement, and\n\n165\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.430\nthere's no right or wrong.\n\n166\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:41.960\nI mean, you might come up with your own\ncode, where you've got I don't know,\n\n167\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.470\norange, purple, and red for\ndifferent designations.\n\n168\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.639\nThe problem with something like that\nis it might mean something to you, but\n\n169\n00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:53.358\nI have to train all my employees\npurple means public or something.\n\n170\n00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:56.091\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny you joke with that,\nbut I actually worked for\n\n171\n00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:58.890\nan organization that did use colors for\ndifferent job roles.\n\n172\n00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.776\nAnd we had lanyards, so that if we\nsaw someone in a particular zone and\n\n173\n00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:05.865\nthat color on,\nthen we would tell on them or whatever.\n\n174\n00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.153\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n175\n00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:10.639\n&gt;&gt; If we saw a visitor and they were\nescorted then we would know without\n\n176\n00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.860\neven having to approach them and so yeah.\n\n177\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so anything you wanna implement\nwill work as long as you can make sure\n\n178\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.990\nthat everybody's properly trained and\n\n179\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.220\nunderstands what your different\ncolors mean in that case.\n\n180\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.620\nAll right, next thing I want to talk about\nis the triple A, and it's a great service.\n\n181\n00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.345\nYou get a flat tire, you run out of gas.\n\n182\n00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:30.218\n&gt;&gt; They come pick you up.\n\n183\n00:09:30.218 --> 00:09:32.777\n&gt;&gt; They're great people, no, just kidding.\n\n184\n00:09:32.777 --> 00:09:36.950\nTriple A in this case,\nwe're going to talk about IT security and\n\n185\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.740\nour security essentials.\n\n186\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.370\nWe're talking about the three As,\nauthentication, authorization, and\n\n187\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.690\naccounting, all right?\n\n188\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.590\nAuthentication, authentication\nis the process of\n\n189\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.600\nverifying the identity of someone or\nsomething.\n\n190\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.470\nDon't get tied up on it being someone.\n\n191\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.670\nIt can be a service,\nit can be a computer, right?\n\n192\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.570\nWhen you boot up your Windows\nmachine in a domain environment,\n\n193\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.830\nit authenticates before you ever\nsee the logon screen, right?\n\n194\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.550\nIt sends its username and\npassword back to the domain controller and\n\n195\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.630\nthen it's verified there.\n\n196\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.690\nSo, I say username, but\nat least it's password, right?\n\n197\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.370\nSo, authentication, verifying\nthe identity of someone or something.\n\n198\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.750\nNow, how we do this?\n\n199\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.360\nWell, it varies.\n\n200\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.245\nAnd we're gonna show some examples in\na little while or in another episode but\n\n201\n00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:29.914\nwe can do, what's the most common\nauthentication method, Cherokee?\n\n202\n00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:31.420\n&gt;&gt; User name and password.\n\n203\n00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right,\n\n204\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.430\nwe all use that probably everyday\nwhen you log on to your system.\n\n205\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.501\n&gt;&gt; Multiple times especially when\nyou're browsing the web they single\n\n206\n00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.331\nof that concept.\n\n207\n00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:42.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the reason it's so\ncommon is it's very easy to implement.\n\n208\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.270\nAll I need is a database with username and\npassword pairs in there.\n\n209\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.300\nAnd when I pop up a form or\nsome kind of dialog box for\n\n210\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.500\nyou to type your information in\nyou submit it, it goes back.\n\n211\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.700\nIt's verified or validated against\nthe database, and it's either yay or nay,\n\n212\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.650\nso very easy to implement,\nvery inexpensive.\n\n213\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.210\nIt's built in to our Windows operating\nsystems, our Linux operating systems,\n\n214\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:09.580\nour Mac operating systems,\nour Apple OSs, it's built into those.\n\n215\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.160\nSo like I said, it's widely,\nwidely implemented.\n\n216\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.185\nIt's also probably the weakest form of\nauthentication we could possibly use.\n\n217\n00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:18.370\n&gt;&gt; Completely.\n\n218\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:24.437\n&gt;&gt; Because we rely, typically, on\nthe identity to create their own password.\n\n219\n00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:27.646\nAnd their not gonna understand,\nor their gonna take shortcuts,\n\n220\n00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.990\nthey don't know what\na strong password means.\n\n221\n00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.520\nAnd there just a sting of letters and\nnumbers and special characters and so\n\n222\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.630\nall passwords are crackable\nright by that theory.\n\n223\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.650\nBecause-\n&gt;&gt; Eventually.\n\n224\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.488\n&gt;&gt; Eventually right,\nif it's just letters and numbers and\n\n225\n00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:45.270\nspecial characters that I can type on my\nkeyboard then if I try every possible\n\n226\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.611\ncombination I will eventually stumble upon\nyour password it's just a matter of time.\n\n227\n00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:52.932\nNow that time-\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna be on this\n\n228\n00:11:52.932 --> 00:11:54.020\nplanet at this time?\n\n229\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.983\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we might be living on Mars.\n\n230\n00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:56.446\n&gt;&gt; Is the planet going\nto exist at this time?\n\n231\n00:11:56.446 --> 00:12:00.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nthere's a time factor to consider.\n\n232\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.300\nBut in just basic process thinking,\nall passwords are crackable.\n\n233\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.830\nWhether it's feasible to crack it,\n\n234\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.670\nthat's another story,\nwe'll talk about that later.\n\n235\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.720\nSo that's authentication.\n\n236\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.868\nAuthorization is\ndetermining what rights and\n\n237\n00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:21.160\nor permissions an identity has, right?\n\n238\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.622\nAnd this has to be based on\nsuccessful authentication.\n\n239\n00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:29.140\nWe will come back to that\nconcept here in just a second.\n\n240\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.270\nOr you know what let's go ahead and\ntalk about it now.\n\n241\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.860\nI'll change up in the orders\nhere on our show now.\n\n242\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthose two terms they sound similar but\n\n243\n00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:36.229\nthey definitely do not\nmean the same thing here.\n\n244\n00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:37.970\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't.\n\n245\n00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.420\nAnd a lot of people as you say\ntry to interchange them or\n\n246\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.870\ndon't understand the subtle\ndifference between them.\n\n247\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.650\nAuthentication, verifying\nthe identity of someone or something.\n\n248\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:52.130\nAuthorization, determining what rights and\nprivileges that identity has.\n\n249\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.690\nAnd you cannot authorize somebody or\n\n250\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.040\nsomething until they've been\nsuccessfully authenticated.\n\n251\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.690\nThink about that for a second.\n\n252\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:06.120\nHow can I tell you what permissions you\nhave if I don't know who you are, right?\n\n253\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.280\nSo only after successful authentication\noccurs, now I know who you are.\n\n254\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.880\nNow I can go, you're Mike.\n\n255\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.280\nYou're in the administrators group so\nyou get this and this.\n\n256\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.910\nAnd you're in the blah, blah, blah group\nso you get this and this, and this, and so\n\n257\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.900\non and so forth.\n\n258\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.780\nOr you've identified yourself as the DHCP\nserver, so you're allowed to access\n\n259\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.550\nthe DHCP database and write to\nthe database and things like that.\n\n260\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.255\nBecause, once I've determined who you are,\nyou're the DHCP server service,\n\n261\n00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:35.760\nnow I know what level I can determine,\nwhat level of access you have\n\n262\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.530\nto the DHCP database, so those system\nlogs, or whatever the case may be.\n\n263\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.660\nSo, authorization only comes\nafter successful authentication.\n\n264\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.320\n&gt;&gt; And Mike if you think about\nit from that perspective and\n\n265\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.670\nyou approach it that way, it makes\ncompletely perfect sense because we're\n\n266\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.010\nalways told to implement the privilege\nof least, what am I gonna say here.\n\n267\n00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.400\n&gt;&gt; Privilege, or provision of,\nor principle of least privilege.\n\n268\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Principle of least privilege.\nThere we go, tongue twister.\n\n269\n00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.400\nWhen it comes to security because it's\nnot like a one and done, not everyone,\n\n270\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.110\nnot all of your users should\nhave that same access.\n\n271\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.770\nWe were just talking about those\ndifferent levels of classification.\n\n272\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.310\nWell, guess what, that's what\nwe're talking about right here.\n\n273\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n274\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.080\nHow can I say that you have access\nto internal and confidential but\n\n275\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.680\nnot restricted if I\ndon't know who you are.\n\n276\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.950\nIf you're the CEO, then maybe you should\nhave access to the restricted as well.\n\n277\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.800\nSo, yes,\ncannot determine what rights you get or\n\n278\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.860\nwhat permissions you get until\nyou've been authenticated.\n\n279\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.560\nAll right, and then the last A of\nour triple A, is the accounting or\n\n280\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.533\naccountability or sometimes you'll see it\nreferred to as auditing, depending on who.\n\n281\n00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:42.063\nBut we're going to stick\nwith the G6 terminology and\n\n282\n00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:45.455\nwe're gonna call it accountability,\nall right.\n\n283\n00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:50.826\nAnd but what it really means is logging,\ntracking everything that's going on.\n\n284\n00:14:50.826 --> 00:14:56.330\nWho's been authenticated and\nthen what authorizations they were given?\n\n285\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:01.760\nLogging the fact that Mike accessed\nthis file at such and such time and\n\n286\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.870\nwas able to do so, because he's a member\nof this group or whatever the case may be.\n\n287\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.140\nSo accountability is\nthe auditing side of things,\n\n288\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.220\nthe logging side of the triple A process.\n\n289\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.755\n&gt;&gt; And I just wanna remember or\n\n290\n00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:19.496\nremind you to not get boxed into thinking\nabout it from just a technical standpoint,\n\n291\n00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:23.265\nbecause if you also remember,\nwe spoke about physical security.\n\n292\n00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:27.466\nSo, when you have visitors coming into\nyour building and they have sign in, and\n\n293\n00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:31.226\nshow an ID, that's another example\nof access control being used, and\n\n294\n00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:34.965\nlogging because you're authenticating,\nyou're showing that ID.\n\n295\n00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:37.710\nYou say hey, I have an appointment\nwith Mike at 3:00 PM and\n\n296\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.810\nthey say, let me verify that.\n\n297\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.170\nThey authenticate you and if you do\nhave an appointment you can go and\n\n298\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.530\nsit and wait for Mike, but that's\nanother example of logging right there.\n\n299\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right, all As are covered.\n\n300\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.432\nI mean, if, like you said, the guard\nchecks your ID, he's got your ID so\n\n301\n00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.760\nhe's authenticated you.\n\n302\n00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.798\nAnd then maybe he gives you,\nyou were talking about lanyards,\n\n303\n00:15:57.798 --> 00:15:59.165\nmaybe he gives you a badge-\n&gt;&gt; Bingo.\n\n304\n00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:01.604\n&gt;&gt; That allows you to say,\nokay, I'm a visitor.\n\n305\n00:16:01.604 --> 00:16:05.437\nThat means now anybody walking by\nknows That they've checked in,\n\n306\n00:16:05.437 --> 00:16:07.290\nthey've been authenticated.\n\n307\n00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.946\nThey're now authorized to visit or\ngo wherever visitors are allowed to go but\n\n308\n00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:17.000\nnot authorized to go, say, in the server\ncloset or restricted areas hopefully.\n\n309\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n310\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.690\n&gt;&gt; And then the accountability,\nas you said, you've got the logged in.\n\n311\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.340\nThis is what time Mike showed up.\n\n312\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.978\nThis what time Mike turned in his\nvisitor badge and left the building.\n\n313\n00:16:25.978 --> 00:16:29.553\nSo I have a complete record of\nthe process of authentication,\n\n314\n00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:32.670\nauthorization and\nthe other accountability there.\n\n315\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.480\nSo great example, Cherokee.\n\n316\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.688\nAnother term we wanna be\nfamiliar with is the CIA triad.\n\n317\n00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:42.510\nThis is something that's been around for\nquite awhile.\n\n318\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.430\nIt's the concept of not the bureau here,\nthe United States-\n\n319\n00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.830\n&gt;&gt; Intelligence Community, yeah.\n\n320\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's not that.\n\n321\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.860\nIt's the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n322\n00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.885\nAnd we often talk about these again,\nthe CIA triad,\n\n323\n00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:05.785\nwhen it comes to security, these are our\nfoundations that we're trying to provide.\n\n324\n00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:09.191\nThese are the three legs, if you will,\nof the security stool and\n\n325\n00:17:09.191 --> 00:17:10.905\neverything sits on top of that.\n\n326\n00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.004\nAnd you take one of these legs out,\nthe stool falls over.\n\n327\n00:17:14.004 --> 00:17:18.428\nThere's all those little crazy analogies\nthat you can come up with for this but\n\n328\n00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:21.000\nit is a very important concept, right?\n\n329\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.005\nSo let's talk about each\none of those terms.\n\n330\n00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:27.842\nNow confidentiality, making sure\nthat only authorized identities can\n\n331\n00:17:27.842 --> 00:17:30.490\naccess the information, right?\n\n332\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.274\nIt's confidential, it doesn't necessarily\nmean that it's super secret, but\n\n333\n00:17:35.274 --> 00:17:39.170\nlike an internal document,\nit's only available for employees.\n\n334\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.310\n&gt;&gt; So how do we achieve this?\n\n335\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not for public consumption.\n\n336\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.550\nSo in some way, I've got to do that, I've\ngotta make sure that anybody inside can\n\n337\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.973\nget access to it but\npeople outside cannot.\n\n338\n00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:53.340\nSo I'm providing a level of\nconfidentiality to that information.\n\n339\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.392\nI'm ensuring that if you haven't\nauthenticated with my system,\n\n340\n00:17:56.392 --> 00:18:00.329\nyou don't have a valid user account, you\ndon't get access to the document, right?\n\n341\n00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.556\nThe everyone group isn't listed in\nthe access control list, for example.\n\n342\n00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:06.700\nSo confidentiality can be\nprovided in different ways.\n\n343\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.250\nA lot of times, we think about encryption\nas a way to provide confidentiality,\n\n344\n00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.090\ncuz then I can control who's\nallowed to decrypt the information.\n\n345\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.730\nIf you don't have the proper key\nto decrypt that information,\n\n346\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.220\nyou're not gonna get access to it.\n\n347\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.070\nSo I'm providing that\nlevel of confidentiality.\n\n348\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.007\nYou might have an encrypted portion\non your thumb drive or your phone or\n\n349\n00:18:26.007 --> 00:18:27.483\nyou can put information.\n\n350\n00:18:27.483 --> 00:18:30.619\nAnd if somebody steals your phone,\nthey can get access to a lot but\n\n351\n00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:32.180\nnot that information, right?\n\n352\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.185\nSo you're keeping that confidential.\n\n353\n00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:36.460\nPatient records, it would be confidential.\n\n354\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.477\nYour doctor and you, or\n\n355\n00:18:38.477 --> 00:18:42.490\nany healthcare professionals working\nwith the doctor or whatever,\n\n356\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.590\nare the only people that have access to\nthat or maybe your insurance company.\n\n357\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.154\nSo they have to provide\ntheir confidentiality.\n\n358\n00:18:47.154 --> 00:18:52.123\nAnd as a big part of many regulations,\nit's specifying the level of\n\n359\n00:18:52.123 --> 00:18:58.067\nconfidentiality that you have to maintain\non certain information, all right?\n\n360\n00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:02.480\nThen we've got integrity,\nthe second leg in our little triad here.\n\n361\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.182\nAnd integrity involves making sure that\nthe information has not been modified\n\n362\n00:19:07.182 --> 00:19:12.300\nin either-\n&gt;&gt; Malicious or non-malicious.\n\n363\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, accidental or malicious manner,\n\n364\n00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:18.980\nwhether that means through\ndata corruption, right?\n\n365\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.270\nA spreadsheet that we keep all of\nour inventory of our assets on\n\n366\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.660\nbecomes corrupt.\n\n367\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.800\nWell, that data lost its integrity,\nit's no longer valid.\n\n368\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.980\nSomebody accesses a database and,\nmaliciously,\n\n369\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.400\nremoves some records, I've lost\nintegrity on that customer database now.\n\n370\n00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.892\nI can't say that it hasn't been\nmodified in a way that it wasn't\n\n371\n00:19:40.892 --> 00:19:42.731\nsupposed to be modified.\n\n372\n00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:46.490\nSo it can be accidental,\nit can be malicious.\n\n373\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.710\nAnd when we do hashing algorithms\nto provide hash values for\n\n374\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.280\nfiles, this is a way to provide integrity.\n\n375\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.988\nCuz we know if I run that document through\nthe same hashing algorithm more than once,\n\n376\n00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:01.820\nit's always gonna generate\nthe exact same hash value.\n\n377\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.300\nChange a single character in there,\n\n378\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.100\nand it comes up with a completely\ndifferent hash value.\n\n379\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.610\nSo I can verify that I have integrity.\n\n380\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.710\nWe've talked about it in other\nsecurity classes when we do\n\n381\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.180\nevidence collection, right?\n\n382\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.820\nWe run the drive, for example,\nthrough a hashing algorithm.\n\n383\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.751\nAnd I've got a duplicate, I can verify\nthat my duplicate is exactly the same\n\n384\n00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:26.847\nas the original due to those hash values,\nthat's integrity.\n\n385\n00:20:26.847 --> 00:20:28.610\nTCP/IP packets, right?\n\n386\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Authentication headers, yeah.\n\n387\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.683\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, there's a checksum in there\nwhich is basically a hash value that when\n\n388\n00:20:34.683 --> 00:20:38.649\nthis sending in or sends a packet,\nit puts that hash value in there.\n\n389\n00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:42.640\nThat CRC, my cyclic redundancy check,\nit throws it across the wire.\n\n390\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.449\nThe other end gets it,\ntakes my hash value, sets it aside or\n\n391\n00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:49.013\nruns it through a hash value of their\nown or hashing algorithm of their own.\n\n392\n00:20:49.013 --> 00:20:52.550\nIt generates the hash value,\ncompares it with the one I sent.\n\n393\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.960\nThey match, we're good to go,\nthey don't match, drop and resend, right?\n\n394\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.070\nSo we see data integrity\neverywhere we look.\n\n395\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.130\nAgain, hashing is a very good way to\nverify, they would have integrity.\n\n396\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.850\nAll your system files.\n\n397\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.876\nWhen you look at it in Windows and\nother operating systems,\n\n398\n00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:13.582\nthose are run through hashing algorithms\nand those maintain the files.\n\n399\n00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:17.705\nAnd every time my system starts, it runs\nthose files through hashing algorithms and\n\n400\n00:21:17.705 --> 00:21:19.458\ncompares it to the baseline it has.\n\n401\n00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:22.989\nAnd if they've been modified,\nit fails to boot or it goes and\n\n402\n00:21:22.989 --> 00:21:26.705\ndownloads a new copy of that DLL,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n403\n00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:28.845\nSo integrity, very important.\n\n404\n00:21:28.845 --> 00:21:30.575\nTypically, done with hashing algorithms.\n\n405\n00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:33.204\nAnd then availability, right?\n\n406\n00:21:33.204 --> 00:21:35.360\nAvailability is kind of\nan odd one sometimes,\n\n407\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.195\nbecause people don't think about it.\n\n408\n00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:38.471\nIt's the forgotten leg.\n\n409\n00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:41.667\nBut remember,\nmy three-legged stool, my tripod,\n\n410\n00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:45.227\ncan't just stand up with just two legs,\nwe need all three.\n\n411\n00:21:45.227 --> 00:21:46.707\nYeah, I know, these silly little-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:47.771\n&gt;&gt; Analogies, but\n\n413\n00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:50.740\nthe point is availability\nis very important.\n\n414\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:57.020\nIt can be unintentional unavailability,\nit can be a mistake in configuration.\n\n415\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.404\nBut the point is the data that\nwe're protecting needs to\n\n416\n00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:03.867\nbe available to those that\nneed access to it, all right?\n\n417\n00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:06.300\nWe'll take access control out for\na minute.\n\n418\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.230\nWe'll assume that if you're accessing it,\nyou're authorized to access this.\n\n419\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.746\nBut making sure that information's\navailable is just as important as making\n\n420\n00:22:15.746 --> 00:22:19.040\nsure that we have confidentiality and\nintegrity, right?\n\n421\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.469\nIf the salespeople go to access\na database that contains the cost or\n\n422\n00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:27.690\nquantity and they're trying\nto make a sale of a product.\n\n423\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.740\nIf they can't get to it,\nif it's unavailable for\n\n424\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.070\nsome reason, it does them no good, right?\n\n425\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.480\nThe resource doesn't help them and\n\n426\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.230\nI have failed at my job because\nit's not available for them.\n\n427\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.513\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, you had mentioned this,\nit's kind of a weird one to think about.\n\n428\n00:22:40.513 --> 00:22:42.672\nAnd truly it is because, again,\n\n429\n00:22:42.672 --> 00:22:46.154\nI challenge you to think\noutside the box in this room.\n\n430\n00:22:46.154 --> 00:22:50.816\nBecause not only are we talking about\nfiles and systems being available and\n\n431\n00:22:50.816 --> 00:22:54.812\naccessible, but even things like\nour signal to noise ratios and\n\n432\n00:22:54.812 --> 00:22:57.380\nthe electricity in the building.\n\n433\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.518\nAll of these components\nfall under availability.\n\n434\n00:22:59.518 --> 00:23:01.911\nBecause without a single component,\n\n435\n00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:06.770\nif we can not continue our normal line\nof production without that component,\n\n436\n00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.020\nthen that falls under this bottom\nleg here for the availability.\n\n437\n00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we can take it a step\nfurther, we can look at system.\n\n438\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.600\nI mean, what is a denial of service or\na distributed denial of service attack?\n\n439\n00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.140\nThey're the type that still has\nused the web server, for example.\n\n440\n00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.805\nThey're doing a DDOS attack\nagainst your web server,\n\n441\n00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:26.300\nthey're bringing it down,\nwhat do we mean bringing it down?\n\n442\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.754\nIt's unavailable to the public that\nwants to come and buy my product, right?\n\n443\n00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:32.600\nSo, I mean,\navailability is a big part of it.\n\n444\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.044\nOtherwise, DDOS attacks wouldn't matter,\nwho cares, right?\n\n445\n00:23:35.044 --> 00:23:36.071\nAnd, I mean, I know that's kinda silly.\n\n446\n00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:39.639\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter that the entire\nEast Coast of the Internet is down today-\n\n447\n00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:40.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.174\n&gt;&gt; For the majority of the day.\n\n449\n00:23:42.174 --> 00:23:46.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so availability is a big part of\nsecurity making sure that resources that\n\n450\n00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:51.017\nare available when they're needed\nwhether that's the internal employees,\n\n451\n00:23:51.017 --> 00:23:53.610\nwhether that's to the general public.\n\n452\n00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.939\nWhether that's to our business partner and\nwhatever the case maybe.\n\n453\n00:23:56.939 --> 00:24:00.939\n&gt;&gt; And the key is to really find a good\nbalance, because it's not necessarily\n\n454\n00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:04.445\nthat one of these fundamentals is\nmore important than the other.\n\n455\n00:24:04.445 --> 00:24:08.380\nBecause you really need to look at it,\napproach it from all three here so.\n\n456\n00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it's a great point.\n\n457\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:15.000\nYou do have to find that balance cuz I\ncan cause the availability issue myself\n\n458\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.350\nby taking one of the others too far.\n\n459\n00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n460\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.630\n&gt;&gt; If I encrypt information\nthat's supposed to be\n\n461\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.530\navailable to the general public.\n\n462\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.845\nIt's not gonna work,\n\n463\n00:24:22.845 --> 00:24:25.710\nI can lock things down so hard that\n&gt;&gt; Nobody can buy\n\n464\n00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.663\nmy product\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n465\n00:24:26.663 --> 00:24:30.356\nlegitimate users can't access\nthe resource, I haven't done my done.\n\n466\n00:24:30.356 --> 00:24:34.563\nI have focused in on confidentiality and\nmaybe integrity but\n\n467\n00:24:34.563 --> 00:24:39.880\nI forgot about the third leg,\nI haven't focused in on availability.\n\n468\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.530\nSo you got to make sure that we are paying\nattention to all three of those.\n\n469\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.730\nThose are the pillars of IT security,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n470\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.070\navailability.\n\n471\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:53.230\nWe'll round off this episode talking\nabout a couple of access control methods\n\n472\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.170\nthat they happen to call out on the exam.\n\n473\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.610\nThere are more, but\n\n474\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.090\nwe'll stick with these two because\nthey're specifically called out.\n\n475\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.970\nAnd that is MAC and DAC, or\nMandatory Access Control and\n\n476\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.280\ndiscretionary access control, right?\n\n477\n00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.810\nNow when we look at mandatory access\ncontrol, really what this entails\n\n478\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:20.680\nis using a system of labels and labeling\nidentities and labeling resources.\n\n479\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.450\nAnd then when access is required or\nrequested we're matching labels and\n\n480\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.960\nwe're seeing whether or\nnot the identity is allowed or\n\n481\n00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.020\nhas the appropriate level\nto access that resource.\n\n482\n00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.890\nYou see this a lot in military,\n\n483\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.470\nI have a top secret clearance that gives\nme access to top secret documents.\n\n484\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.910\nDocuments that are labeled top secret and\nthings that are below that.\n\n485\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.100\nIt's typically your level and\n\n486\n00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.310\ndown when we look at these\nmandatory access control systems.\n\n487\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.740\nBut if I have a label\n\n488\n00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.100\nof confidential,\nI don't get to see the top secret stuff.\n\n489\n00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.710\nThat label is above my clearance level.\n\n490\n00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.760\nI'm not gonna get access to it.\n\n491\n00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.640\nAnd they call it mandatory\naccess control because\n\n492\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.020\nit's typically mandated by somebody\nother than the information owner.\n\n493\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.870\nNot to say that it can't be,\nin some of the systems that I see now,\n\n494\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.620\nit is actually up to the information\ncreator or owner to label their\n\n495\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.100\ninformation, to label the documents or the\nresource that they're trying to protect.\n\n496\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.160\nBecause who better than the creator\nto know what's in there?\n\n497\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.300\nAnd decide, well,\nI've included these words or\n\n498\n00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.030\nI've included this kind of information.\n\n499\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.700\nThis needs to be labeled top secret,\nright.\n\n500\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, you say that, and\nyou have a great deal of knowledge.\n\n501\n00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.400\nBut you gotta remember,\nnot everyone does have that.\n\n502\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.940\nAnd they might not even\nunderstand these rules, and\n\n503\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.540\nthey can mess things up\npretty badly if they set\n\n504\n00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.200\nthe permissions incorrectly because\nthey don't even know what it means.\n\n505\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So that's one way to look at it.\n\n506\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.240\n&gt;&gt; It is, and that's,\n\n507\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.080\nwith mandatory access control, it's like-\n&gt;&gt; You eliminate that, because we\n\n508\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.140\nhave this inflexible concept here, and\nwe're removing that guesswork, right?\n\n509\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:07.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because then it almost goes\nback to a discretionary type system.\n\n510\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.660\nIf we're allowing the information\ncreator to decide who has access to it.\n\n511\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.710\nBut unlike a discretionary, you're still\njust applying a label, and in the end\n\n512\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.650\nthe mandatory access control is gonna\nkick in anytime somebody accesses it.\n\n513\n00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.090\nAnd it's gonna compare the identities\nlabel and the resource label.\n\n514\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.570\nSo there is an issue of mislabeling, but\n\n515\n00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.190\nthe mandatory access\ncontrol still functions.\n\n516\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.890\nWe just might have to adjust how we're\ngoing about putting those labels on there.\n\n517\n00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Misconfigured permissions, no, never.\n\n518\n00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know right.\n\n519\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:40.180\nAnd it's funny, we used to say that really\nyou don't see these in computer systems,\n\n520\n00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.250\nthe mandatory access control as\nmuch because it is a little more\n\n521\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.170\ndifficult to enforce, but\nWindows ever since Vista.\n\n522\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.463\nAnd I can think of few, one in particular,\n\n523\n00:27:51.463 --> 00:27:56.170\nSELinux, all implement\nmandatory access control.\n\n524\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.722\nAnd it's like in Vista for example and\n\n525\n00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:06.277\nWindows, there's a integrity identifier.\n\n526\n00:28:06.277 --> 00:28:07.340\nAnd they've really changed it.\n\n527\n00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.390\nThey don't call,\nyou know Windows, Microsoft.\n\n528\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.190\nThey like to do things and\nthen put their own spin on it and\n\n529\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.930\nnot follow the standards.\n\n530\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.120\nNot Microsoft, right?\n\n531\n00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.780\nThey call it mandatory\nintegrity control and\n\n532\n00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.645\nresources will get tagged\nwith an integrity ID,\n\n533\n00:28:23.645 --> 00:28:28.560\nit's basically a SID or integrity SID,\njust like our user SID and our resource,\n\n534\n00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.620\nthey write every security\nobject in Windows.\n\n535\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.980\nIt's a security identifier.\n\n536\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.306\nThey can also be set up\nto receive a mandatory\n\n537\n00:28:38.306 --> 00:28:43.180\nintegrity control identifier, as well.\n\n538\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.200\nAnd then we can do the same thing, right?\n\n539\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.100\nWhen you initially go to access\nthe resource in the user's token\n\n540\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.602\nthat they give when they authenticate,\nare all their SIDs.\n\n541\n00:28:52.602 --> 00:28:57.180\nThat's gonna include their user SID,\ntheir group SIDs, and\n\n542\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.090\npotentially an integrity SID.\n\n543\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.310\nThat's their label.\n\n544\n00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.620\nResources are gonna get\ntagged with an integrity SID.\n\n545\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.960\nAnd before it ever checks permissions,\nyou've already been identified,\n\n546\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.180\nyou've already been authenticated when you\nlogged into the system by Active Directory\n\n547\n00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.850\nin a Windows environment,\nyou got issued your token.\n\n548\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.530\nThat token has your integrity ID in there.\n\n549\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.890\nWhen you go to access a resource,\n\n550\n00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.060\nbefore it ever looks at the permissions,\nit looks at the two labels.\n\n551\n00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.850\nAnd it says, your integrity ID,\n[INAUDIBLE] nope.\n\n552\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.370\nYou are not able to access this resource.\n\n553\n00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.060\nRegardless of what permissions\nmight be listed there for you.\n\n554\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.600\nIt's saying that you don't\nhave the proper label.\n\n555\n00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.620\nSo you can implement mandatory\naccess control in Windows.\n\n556\n00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.280\nSE Linux does the same thing.\n\n557\n00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.090\nSlightly different way of processing,\nbut same concept.\n\n558\n00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.610\nWe can enforce mandatory\naccess control there.\n\n559\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.200\nAnd then the last one is discretionary\naccess control, which is\n\n560\n00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.060\nwhat we're familiar within our Windows\nsystems, and in our Unix/Linux systems.\n\n561\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.490\nThis is our permissions, right?\n\n562\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.210\nWhere discretionary,\n\n563\n00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.700\nthey call it discretionary because we\nleave it to the discretion of the owner of\n\n564\n00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.650\nthe object to decide who has permissions,\nnot just decide what label goes on there.\n\n565\n00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:08.250\nCuz in mandatory access control,\n\n566\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:13.440\nwe can allow the information owner\nto label the resource, right?\n\n567\n00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.190\nSo they can determine what label it gets\nbased on what information's in there.\n\n568\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.600\nThey have no control over who\nhas the matching label, right?\n\n569\n00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.550\nYes, I can mark this as top secret, but\n\n570\n00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.350\nI can't give Cherokee top\nsecret clearance, right?\n\n571\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.470\nSo that's mandatory access control.\n\n572\n00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.900\nDiscretionary access control,\nI can choose what groups have\n\n573\n00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.920\nwhat level of access by modifying\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n574\n00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.700\nSo now,\nnot only do I create the resource but\n\n575\n00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.110\nI can control who has\naccess to the resource.\n\n576\n00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.600\nDifferent from mandatory access control,\nright?\n\n577\n00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.860\nI can decide that hey,\nanybody in the sales group has read write.\n\n578\n00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.190\nAnd anybody in the marketing\ngroup has full control and\n\n579\n00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.100\nthe administrators have no control,\nthat's cuz we like to mess with them.\n\n580\n00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.190\nBut is that my discretion.\n\n581\n00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.560\nAnd that is one of the limitations\nof discretionary access control,\n\n582\n00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.290\nis because Cherokee's mad at me,\n\n583\n00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.830\nshe might put an explicit deny in there\nthat says Mike can't access the resource.\n\n584\n00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.710\nI need to access the resource,\nor I can't do my job, right?\n\n585\n00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.888\nBut Cherokee was able to block me from\nthat cuz I parked too close to her\n\n586\n00:31:18.888 --> 00:31:19.547\nvehicle.\n\n587\n00:31:19.547 --> 00:31:21.734\nShe's very sensitive about those things.\n\n588\n00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:25.270\n[LAUGH] A little door ding in there,\nI swear it wasn't me.\n\n589\n00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.240\nBut that's the idea behind\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n590\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.130\nYou see this in Windows.\n\n591\n00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.920\nYou might not even know, if you're newer\nto working with permissions in Windows,\n\n592\n00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.150\nwhen you right-click on any\nobject on NTFS partition,\n\n593\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.950\nit has an access control list, right?\n\n594\n00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.130\nWell, you click on the Security tab,\nyou go Properties, and then Security.\n\n595\n00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.090\nWhat you're looking at on a security tab,\n\n596\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.950\nthat is the Discretionary Access\nControl List or DACL, all right?\n\n597\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.470\nEach one of those entries, sales,\nmarketing, administrators, creator, owner,\n\n598\n00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.470\neach one of those entries is known as\nan ACE or an Access Control Entry.\n\n599\n00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.998\nAnd as the owner of the object\nI can modify the DACL,\n\n600\n00:32:01.998 --> 00:32:06.924\nthe discretionary action control list,\nby adding or removing aces and\n\n601\n00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:09.974\nthen assigning permissions to those aces.\n\n602\n00:32:09.974 --> 00:32:11.330\nA lot of organizations,\n\n603\n00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:15.600\nthis is why you see a lot of organizations\nchange owners on resources, right?\n\n604\n00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.410\nI might have created that spreadsheet\nthat everybody in the company uses.\n\n605\n00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.720\nSo when I first create it, I'm the creator\nowner which gives me full control\n\n606\n00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.590\nover the object which means I can\nmodify the access control list.\n\n607\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:32.920\nBut once the document's in use and\nwe realize it's a company wide resource.\n\n608\n00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.720\nThey'll take that ownership away from me,\nand\n\n609\n00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.200\nthey'll give it to like\nthe administrators group typically so\n\n610\n00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.470\nthat I can no longer modify the access\ncontrol list if I leave the organization.\n\n611\n00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.890\nThey still have an owner of\nthe object that can go in and modify.\n\n612\n00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.360\nAnd we're not getting into Windows here.\n\n613\n00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.970\nWe've got classes on that.\n\n614\n00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.800\nWe can always change ownership and\nthings like that.\n\n615\n00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.690\nBut I just want you guys to understand the\nkind of the system with the discretionary\n\n616\n00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.150\naccess control,\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n617\n00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:07.340\nSo another way of enforcing\nthe authorization over these resources.\n\n618\n00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.690\nDeciding who has what access to the\nresources, mandatory access control, and\n\n619\n00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.530\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n620\n00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Now there are several other methods\nthat we can implement to really control\n\n621\n00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.920\nwho has access to components within\nour network and our resources, but\n\n622\n00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.090\nI think that's a great start, so thank you\nfor that Mike, and thank you ladies and\n\n623\n00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.120\ngentlemen for tuning in, but stay tuned\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n624\n00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.460\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n625\n00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.730\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n626\n00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n627\n00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.470\n&gt;&gt; See you

00:00:08.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.469\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.999\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose,\nthis is actually a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.520\nIf you've been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.970\nyou'll know that we were talking about\ndifferent types of access control methods.\n\n9\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.290\nWell, we're gonna pick right\nback up with that conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.530\nAnd who better to explain this\ntopic than Mr Mike Rodrick himself.\n\n11\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.208\nThank you for joining us today Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:31.434\n&gt;&gt; I can think of a few better people.\n\n13\n00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:32.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm kidding.\n\n14\n00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:34.834\n[LAUGH] Thanks for\nhaving me back, Cherokee.\n\n15\n00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Excited to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.870\nAnd yeah,\nwe're continuing on with access control.\n\n17\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.470\nAnd we're gonna kinda take a little bit of\na turn because they call out on our exam\n\n18\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.420\nobjectives password cracking for\nWindows and Linux.\n\n19\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.760\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about\nthose types of methodologies, or\n\n20\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.618\nwhat we can do to crack passwords.\n\n21\n00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:55.940\nAnd, I might thing, well,\nhow does that fit into a security class?\n\n22\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.700\nIsn't that more of a hacking thing,\nsomething I might learn in another series?\n\n23\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.850\nBut, in the end, when it comes down to it,\n\n24\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.649\nthis is something that we would\ndo as system administrators.\n\n25\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.534\nAs IT professionals, if we're gonna be\ndoing any type of penetration testing in\n\n26\n00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:17.451\nour organization, we wanna verify\nthat our password policies, for\n\n27\n00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.763\nexample, are being followed, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:23.664\nAre the controls that we put in place,\nimplemented properly and\n\n29\n00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:27.930\nare they making sure that our users\nhave to use strong passwords?\n\n30\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200\nAre our users actually\nusing strong passwords?\n\n31\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.000\nWe're not cracking the passwords to try to\ngain access to their information, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.720\nBut I would like to know if any\nof my passwords can be cracked\n\n33\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360\nwithin the first 15 minutes.\n\n34\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.188\nYeah, I'm not gonna spend days and\nhours and hours and days and months and\n\n35\n00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:46.293\nyears trying to crack every\none of my employees passwords.\n\n36\n00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:47.720\nThat's not what I'm trying to do.\n\n37\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.528\nBut I might go through and run this and\n\n38\n00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:53.490\njust make sure that none of them pop up in\nthe first 30 minutes of running a tool on\n\n39\n00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.932\nthem because then I know that they're\nnot following best practices,\n\n40\n00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:00.800\nthey're not implementing it properly,\nor they don't understand.\n\n41\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.450\nI need more training,\nI need better controls that kind of thing.\n\n42\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean legitimately I've had to\nuse several password cracking utilities\n\n43\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.300\njust throughout the course\nof working in the field.\n\n44\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.408\nBecause for legitimate purposes, it's\na great tool to have in your tool kit and\n\n45\n00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:19.333\nyou might come on to a company and the\nperson who's set the passwords left and\n\n46\n00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:23.351\nyou might have extra equipment that you\ngot second hand and things like that.\n\n47\n00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.803\nThat you need to think about as well.\n\n48\n00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:28.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are very good reasons\nyou would use something like this.\n\n49\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.340\nTo break that password, to get into that\nold system into that nobody's logged into\n\n50\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.930\nin months or as you said buying something\nand it's already got a password set on it.\n\n51\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.550\nIt's not the default.\n\n52\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.600\nWhat do you do if you can't reset it or\nsomething.\n\n53\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.450\nYou might need to crack that password.\n\n54\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.670\nSo, let's talk about this.\n\n55\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.990\nWhen we talk about cracking\npasswords in general,\n\n56\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.802\nfirst of all passwords are not\nstored as plain text, right?\n\n57\n00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:54.910\nThey're gonna be stored, they're gonna be\nfirst run through a hashing algorithm,\n\n58\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.910\nand then the output of that hashing\nalgorithm, a message digest,\n\n59\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.040\na hash value, a digest,\nwhatever they wanna call it.\n\n60\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.710\nThat output is then stored.\n\n61\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.120\nAnd if we remember how these\nhashing algorithms work,\n\n62\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440\nthey are cryptographic\nhashing algorithms anyway.\n\n63\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.280\nWhen we input text into them,\nthey're run through the formulas, and\n\n64\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.000\nout the other side of the little\ncryptographic machine\n\n65\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.700\ncomes our hash value or\nour message digest.\n\n66\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.620\nThose message digests are fixed length.\n\n67\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.580\nIn other words, it doesn't matter if I\ntake something like MD5 which is gonna put\n\n68\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.400\nout what are we talking about there,\n128 bits if I remember right.\n\n69\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.264\nI know Cherokee can do my\nfact checking for me here.\n\n70\n00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:43.002\nIf it puts out a 128 bit\nstring It doesn't matter if I\n\n71\n00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:46.415\nput a simple text document that says,\nI love you or\n\n72\n00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:52.430\nif I put a text document that contains the\nentire Webster's Dictionary through there,\n\n73\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.950\nit's always gonna output\nthe same length string.\n\n74\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.070\nSo there's not a one to one\nmapping between input and output.\n\n75\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.840\nWhich means it's not reversible.\n\n76\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.640\nUnlike your encryption algorithms that\nwe used where we're encrypting text\n\n77\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.890\nto storage so that nobody else\ncan provide that confidentiality.\n\n78\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.400\nBut I can get the information back\nout when I need it if I'm authorized.\n\n79\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.550\nHashing algorithms because\nthere's not a one to one mapping,\n\n80\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.690\nthey're not reversible.\n\n81\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.580\nI can't get the original text back\nout by running it back through\n\n82\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.315\nthat Hashing algorithm, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:30.195\nBut remember the other cool\nthing about hashing algorithms.\n\n84\n00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:34.898\nEvery time I put a document through,\nor a phrase, or whatever it is,\n\n85\n00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:39.131\nthrough a hashing algorithm it\nputs out that message digest.\n\n86\n00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.987\nEvery time I run it through, it's always\ngonna output the exact same message\n\n87\n00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:47.635\ndigest, unless something\nchanges in the input.\n\n88\n00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.610\nIf the input changes at all it\ncompletely changes the output.\n\n89\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.310\nSo I can verify if something's changed.\n\n90\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.358\nWell, how does that help us in passwords?\n\n91\n00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:57.797\nWell, think about this.\n\n92\n00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.830\nYou type in your super-secret password.\n\n93\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.370\nAnd the computer system,\nthe whatever it is you're using,\n\n94\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.270\nis gonna run it through its hashing\nalgorithm and generate a hash value.\n\n95\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.495\nNow every time you type\nthat exact same thing in.\n\n96\n00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:14.817\nIt generates the exact same hash value.\n\n97\n00:05:14.817 --> 00:05:18.810\nSo the next time you go to log on,\nyou type in your super secret password,\n\n98\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.850\ngenerates a hash value, looks at the hash\nvalue that it has stored for your account.\n\n99\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.750\nIf they match,\nyou must have typed the exact same thing\n\n100\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.270\notherwise they wouldn't match and\nit would know it's not you.\n\n101\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.253\nOr you miss type your password and\nit wouldn't allow you to authenticate.\n\n102\n00:05:33.253 --> 00:05:36.109\nSo, even though I can't reverse and\nget it back out,\n\n103\n00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:38.150\nI can still use it to verify identity.\n\n104\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.488\nI can prove prove that you\nknew the password to type in,\n\n105\n00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:44.548\nin the first place to\ngenerate that output right?\n\n106\n00:05:44.548 --> 00:05:47.488\nNow, because it's not\na one-to-one mapping,\n\n107\n00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:52.388\nit is a fixed length string that's output,\nthere is the room for collision and what\n\n108\n00:05:52.388 --> 00:05:57.288\nwill talk about that when we talk a little\nbit more about hashing in general I think.\n\n109\n00:05:57.288 --> 00:05:57.995\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n110\n00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:00.774\n&gt;&gt; So, let's go answer the story hashes,\n\n111\n00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:04.881\nnow if we are going to try to break these,\nhow can we do that?\n\n112\n00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.990\nI just said that I can't reverse it\nto get the original text back out.\n\n113\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.250\nIt's mathematically impractical anyway.\n\n114\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.836\nOne day we'll have enough\nprocessing power maybe, but\n\n115\n00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:17.028\nbecause it's fixed length and\nit doesn't matter what the input is,\n\n116\n00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:20.625\nI don't know that there's any way to\never derive what the original text was.\n\n117\n00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:25.880\nI can however come up with some\nthings that produce the same output.\n\n118\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.210\nBut again, that's another story we'll talk\nabout, well, no, we'll talk about it now.\n\n119\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.375\nLet's start with the different types\nof attacks we can do against passwords.\n\n120\n00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:35.143\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we've got these hash values, right?\n\n121\n00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:37.906\nAnd we can obtain those\nif it's a Windows system.\n\n122\n00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:41.653\nThey might be stored in the security\naccount manager or the SAM file for\n\n123\n00:06:41.653 --> 00:06:42.870\nyour local accounts.\n\n124\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.024\nThey could be in Active Directory.\n\n125\n00:06:44.024 --> 00:06:48.830\nWe can sniff these off of the network\nas they're passed back and forth.\n\n126\n00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.808\nIn a Linux system they can be\nstored in the Passwd file and\n\n127\n00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.019\nmore current Linux versions.\n\n128\n00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.760\nWe're gonna put them in a shadow file.\n\n129\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.480\nSo they're separated out.\n\n130\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.340\nWe can get access to those.\n\n131\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.950\nWe've used something like pwdump or\n\n132\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.620\nsome other tools that allow me\nto go in there and grab these.\n\n133\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.040\nOr like we said Network sniffers can\nbe used, cuz when you authenticate,\n\n134\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.950\nyou're passing that information\nacross the network, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.430\nSo once I get these hash values,\nI can use tools to try to crack them.\n\n136\n00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.860\nAnd what we're gonna do is not try\nto reverse the hashing algorithm,\n\n137\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.910\nbut we're gonna try to find something\nthat generates the same hash value right,\n\n138\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.010\nwhich should be your password.\n\n139\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.530\nNow there are room for\ncollisions as I said earlier.\n\n140\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.485\nBecause of the fixed length there could be\nmore than one thing that I can input that\n\n141\n00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:38.889\ngenerates the same output.\n\n142\n00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:43.567\nBut again that's kind of a special\nway of we'll deal with rainbow\n\n143\n00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.275\ntables in a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:48.707\nSo if you're doing what's called a\ndictionary attack, this is the first well\n\n145\n00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:52.090\nlet's back up from that, cause really\nwe can do password guessing, right?\n\n146\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.729\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n147\n00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:53.913\n&gt;&gt; That's an easy one.\n\n148\n00:07:53.913 --> 00:07:55.064\n&gt;&gt; I do it all the time.\n\n149\n00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:56.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Myself\n\n150\n00:07:56.678 --> 00:07:58.326\n&gt;&gt; You can say every time I log in\n\n151\n00:07:58.326 --> 00:07:59.573\nis this my password?\n\n152\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:01.112\nI dont know.\n\n153\n00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:04.473\nI could sit down at a machine and\nI know Cherokee I work with her so\n\n154\n00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:07.898\nI know What things she likes,\nmaybe I can find out her birthday,\n\n155\n00:08:07.898 --> 00:08:12.210\nanniversaries, children's birth\ndates things like that, dogs names.\n\n156\n00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.540\nAnd I can just do simple\npassword guessing.\n\n157\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.890\nThat is one way to crack passwords.\n\n158\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.360\nBut on the exam they do call\nout dictionary attacks.\n\n159\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.140\nAnd a dictionary attack is when I've got\na text file with one word on each line.\n\n160\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.770\nAnd what my tool is going to do\nis try each one of those words,\n\n161\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.080\none at a time, to see if it works,\nto see if it's your password.\n\n162\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.200\nSo all we're going to do\nis see if it's this word.\n\n163\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.240\nAnd it'll attempt to do it,\nand if it works great.\n\n164\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.160\nIf it doesn't, move on to the net word.\n\n165\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.820\nSo a dictionary file that\nwe use with these tools,\n\n166\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.100\nis simply a text file with\na whole lot of words on it.\n\n167\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.320\nLet's take a look at one.\n\n168\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.290\nI've got one over here that we can find.\n\n169\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.560\nI jump back out here.\n\n170\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Now, when you say dictionary, Mike,\nare we talking about Webster's Dictionary?\n\n171\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.180\nAre we talking about leetspeak?\n\n172\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.740\nWhat kind of words would be\nincluded within this list?\n\n173\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.790\n&gt;&gt; It could be anything you want,\nactually.\n\n174\n00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Anything?\n[LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.780\n&gt;&gt; Anything you want.\n\n176\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.490\nNow, Cain and\nAbel is a program I'm gonna show you, and\n\n177\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.050\nit comes with a sample word\nlist that you can use.\n\n178\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.760\nAnd, so, you can see, here,\nthat I've opened it up, and\n\n179\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.145\nas I scroll down through it,\nthere's strange things here.\n\n180\n00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:20.563\nOne's San Jose.\n\n181\n00:09:20.563 --> 00:09:22.170\nThat's kinda odd.\n\n182\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.515\nAnd then it starts with\na bunch of A words.\n\n183\n00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:31.170\n[INAUDIBLE] I don't even\nknow if that's a real word.\n\n184\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.250\n[INAUDIBLE] It just goes on and on.\n\n185\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.060\nAnd this,\nyou can see by the size of my scroll bar.\n\n186\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.980\nThis list is very, very long.\n\n187\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, still scrolling.\n\n188\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.788\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm only half way through it.\n\n189\n00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:43.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm down to the Ns.\n\n190\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.370\nBut that’s all a dictionary\nfile is one word on each line.\n\n191\n00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:51.000\nAnd it can contain anything I want but\nthe idea is it contains\n\n192\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.010\nwords that are commonly used as passwords,\nso in fact if we get down to the Ps.\n\n193\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.080\nDown here.\n\n194\n00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.410\nAnd then back up to the PASs for example.\n\n195\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.280\nIt's really hard to scroll,\nthis file is so.\n\n196\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.000\n&gt;&gt; I know, I think I just saw the packet\nPythagorean theorem or something.\n\n197\n00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.635\n&gt;&gt; Large here.\n\n198\n00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:11.919\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm seeing all these different.\n\n199\n00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:13.486\nWhat are you looking for?\n\n200\n00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was looking for\nactually password.\n\n201\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.060\n&gt;&gt; Password.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it is going to be in here.\n\n202\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.550\n&gt;&gt; That is very common, password,\npassword one, two, three.\n\n203\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.445\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm.\nStill in the r's, here we're to the s's.\n\n204\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.750\nWe're getting down there.\n\n205\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.830\n&gt;&gt; You know it's kind of interesting Mike,\nwhen security analysts release,\n\n206\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.070\nany kind of compromised usernames and\npassword lists, and they perform\n\n207\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.060\nany kind of analysis to see what the most\ncommonly used names are and passwords.\n\n208\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.960\nIt's kinda weird.\n\n209\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.350\nI look at those sometimes and\nninja is super common.\n\n210\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.600\nObviously password and then 1234.\n\n211\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.680\nHaving those numbers in\na sequential order at the end.\n\n212\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.310\nAnd like you had mentioned\none time before,\n\n213\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.750\npeople quite often put those\nduplicate words, like.\n\n214\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.780\n&gt;&gt; Passwordpassword or blueblue.\n\n215\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.020\n&gt;&gt; Passwordpassword, yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.520\n&gt;&gt; So that's all this is.\n\n217\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.840\nYou can out there and\nmake your own dictionary file.\n\n218\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.950\nI can start adding words to this.\n\n219\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.710\nI have copies of the Webster's Dictionary,\none word on each line.\n\n220\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.960\nThen you can do some\nmodifications to that.\n\n221\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.900\nYou can change all a's to @ symbols\nto cover your leetspeak type thing.\n\n222\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.060\nYou can find Klingon dictionaries.\n\n223\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.600\nElvish dictionaries.\n\n224\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.630\nSo don't think that,\nhackers are geeks too.\n\n225\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Everyone's covered.\n\n226\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I've got name dictionaries with\n\n227\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:30.050\njust common names, French common names,\nSpanish common names.\n\n228\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.850\nBecause people like to use their names or\nspouse's names, or\n\n229\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.210\nchildren's names as their passwords.\n\n230\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.840\nSo I can use these one file at a time or\n\n231\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.960\nI can just combine them all up into one\nmassive dictionary, doesn't really matter.\n\n232\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.040\nBut that's all the dictionary is,\nis a list of words to try.\n\n233\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.390\nSo it's a way to automate password\nguessing, is really what we're doing here.\n\n234\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.450\nAnd that's why they say if your\npassword is a common word,\n\n235\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.160\nit's not going to do you much good because\nit's not going to take long to crack.\n\n236\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.580\nLet's try one,\nlet's take a look here at Cane and Abel.\n\n237\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.810\nWhat I'm going to do is fire up Cane and\nAbel.\n\n238\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.260\nThis guy has been around for a long time.\n\n239\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.490\nI think you and I and Cherokee were\ntalking about that the other day.\n\n240\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.630\nOne of the first ones you used.\n\n241\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThis is a great Windows password cracking\n\n242\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.370\nutility amongst other things.\n\n243\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.590\nIt does a lot.\n\n245\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.660\nIt does ARP poisoning, session hijacking,\nman in the middle type attacks.\n\n246\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.540\nIt's very very powerful.\n\n247\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.320\nWe're gonna stick with cracking here.\n\n248\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.680\nI going to kind of cheat.\n\n249\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.440\nI haven't dumped any passwords.\n\n250\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.100\nWhat I want to do is show you\nthe cracking capabilities of this thing.\n\n251\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.150\nI've got my cracker tab there\nwith a little key on it.\n\n252\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.560\nSelect it.\n\n253\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.880\nThis little green icon\nis a hash calculator.\n\n254\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.130\nI'm going to calculate the hash.\n\n255\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.690\nFor the word password.\n\n256\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.880\nAnd I'll click Calculate.\n\n257\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.790\nAnd we'll stick with MD5s cuz they're\npretty quick for this demonstration.\n\n258\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.700\nI'm gonna select that hash value.\n\n259\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.790\nYou can see that it generates\nall these different hash values.\n\n260\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Different algorithms that I can use.\n\n261\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.390\nSo this is the message digest,\nor the hash value.\n\n262\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:10.280\nI'm gonna copy that, and I'm gonna go over\nto MD5, and I'm just gonna Insert that.\n\n263\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.760\nAdd to List, Paste that in there,\nand click OK.\n\n264\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.760\nAll right, so this is what you do.\n\n265\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.700\nYou would've gathered this from network\nsniffing, this has a sniffer tab up here.\n\n266\n00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.450\nOr dumping of password\nfiles from somewhere.\n\n267\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.890\nYou've obtained this hash,\nand then you just tell it,\n\n268\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.780\nI want to do a dictionary attack.\n\n269\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.060\nAnd, it's, by default,\ngoing to load up its word list, but\n\n270\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.990\nif I had other word lists I wanted to try.\n\n271\n00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.440\nJust add to list.\n\n272\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.840\nI can add as many as I want.\n\n273\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.670\n&gt;&gt; So would that increase the computing\ntime or the cracking time here?\n\n274\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.210\n&gt;&gt; It would take longer, so\nthe more words you have to go through,\n\n275\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.390\ndepending on where the word is\neventually found in your lists.\n\n276\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.600\nThe other thing that Kane will do is,\nnotice where it says position 3456302,\n\n277\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.230\nthat's because I've used this tool before.\n\n278\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.190\nAnd that was the word it got to when\nit finally cracked the password\n\n279\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.170\nI was working on.\n\n280\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.910\nIt remembers your position because\npassword cracking can take hours, days,\n\n281\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.690\nand even longer so you might not\nbe able to do it all at once.\n\n282\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.130\nSo it's nice you can close it down, come\nback tomorrow pick up where you left off.\n\n283\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.410\nI'm gonna reset that back to the beginning\nof the file by right clicking and\n\n284\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.160\nreset initial file position.\n\n285\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.670\nNow click start and with Cain,\nit's doing several things.\n\n286\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.600\nIt's actually doing a little bit more\nthan a standard dictionary attack.\n\n287\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.930\nLet's talk about a hybrid attack here for\na second.\n\n288\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.530\nAnother type of password attack, a hybrid\nattack is when I combine a dictionary\n\n289\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:39.280\nattack with mangling that string somehow.\n\n290\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.090\nLike taking a word, password, and adding\na couple of numbers to the end of it\n\n291\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.380\nmaybe because people like to\nappend two numbers to it.\n\n292\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.060\n&gt;&gt; So just like several iterations of\nthat one particular style or word,\n\n293\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.860\nphrase, whatever.\n\n294\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nin fact you can see what it's doing here.\n\n295\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.550\nLet me zoom in.\n\n296\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.060\nAnd as is.\n\n297\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.650\nSays okay for each word in that file\nI'm gonna try it just like it is.\n\n298\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.570\nReverse, swap it around\npassword becomes drowssap.\n\n299\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.240\nDouble, pass becomes pass pass.\n\n300\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.030\nMake everything lowercase and\ntry it that way.\n\n301\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.150\nMake the same word all\nuppercase try it that way.\n\n302\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.500\nDo some number permutations.\n\n303\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.122\nChanging As to 4s and Ss to 5s.\n\n304\n00:15:18.122 --> 00:15:20.410\nThat leetspeak type of thing.\n\n305\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.960\nAnd then the very last check mark.\n\n306\n00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.900\nTwo number hybrid brute.\n\n307\n00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.106\nAdd a zero.\n\n308\n00:15:26.106 --> 00:15:27.640\n00, 01, 02, 03.\n\n309\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.810\nSo it's not going through that\ndictionary file just once.\n\n310\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.960\nIt's going through it several times.\n\n311\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.150\nAnd you can see it cracked my password.\n\n312\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.260\nAnd it stopped.\nI'm gonna zoom back out, and\n\n313\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.960\nI will click Exit.\n\n314\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.710\nAnd sure enough,\nit figured out that password was password.\n\n315\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.080\nBecause it's in the dictionary file.\n\n316\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.160\n&gt;&gt; You'd know better, Mike.\n\n317\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:47.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hopefully.\n\n318\n00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:49.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's try another one.\n\n319\n00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.170\nWhat if I did this.\n\n320\n00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.370\nCapital P.\nI'm gonna make up a new password so\n\n321\n00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.020\nyou can see what I'm doing there.\n\n322\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.850\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n323\n00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.030\n&gt;&gt; Modifying it a little bit.\n\n324\n00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.848\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna click Calculate.\n\n325\n00:15:58.848 --> 00:16:00.241\nLet's see if we can stump it.\n\n326\n00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:04.494\nI'm gonna copy that hash value\nthat we wanna try to crack.\n\n327\n00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:11.078\nI'm going to cancel that,\nright-click and insert the hash value.\n\n328\n00:16:11.078 --> 00:16:13.140\nAnd we're gonna run it\nthrough there again.\n\n329\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.050\nI'm gonna do a dictionary attack, and\nI'm gonna reset my word position,\n\n330\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.870\nand we'll start it up.\n\n331\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.358\nAs it's going, I want you to see right\nhere I'm gonna pause it for just a second,\n\n332\n00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:27.578\nit'll continue in the background this\nis just a screen shot that freezes.\n\n333\n00:16:27.578 --> 00:16:33.460\nThat key rate 2,597,683\npasswords per second.\n\n334\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.240\nThis is not a super beefy machine,\n\n335\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.600\nit's a virtual machine, over 2 million\npasswords per second it's trying.\n\n336\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.315\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; This is why it does not take very long\n\n337\n00:16:43.315 --> 00:16:47.630\nto crack these passwords if it's a plain\ntext, if it's just a simple word.\n\n338\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.650\nSo let me zoom back out,\nit's probably finished.\n\n339\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.710\nAnd it stopped,\nit made it all the way through the list.\n\n340\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.680\nZero of one hashes cracked,\nno, it can't get it, right?\n\n341\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.310\nBecause it's not in my list.\n\n342\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:16:59.970\nWhat if I did this?\n\n343\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.377\nI'm gonna have to run this as an\nadministrator, so let me bring up NotePad,\n\n344\n00:17:05.377 --> 00:17:07.321\ncuz of where this file's located.\n\n345\n00:17:07.321 --> 00:17:09.290\nI need administrative rights to modify it.\n\n346\n00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.790\nSo we're gonna go grab that file, and I'm\njust gonna jump anywhere in the list here,\n\n347\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:22.150\nadd a new line, type in that password,\nsave it, close it.\n\n348\n00:17:23.995 --> 00:17:25.215\nAnd we'll try it again.\n\n349\n00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:31.723\nDictionary attack,\nreset that position, and bada bing!\n\n350\n00:17:31.723 --> 00:17:35.334\nI did it on line 67, so\nit didn't take very long to get to it.\n\n351\n00:17:35.334 --> 00:17:37.045\nBut one of one cracked.\n\n352\n00:17:38.665 --> 00:17:41.005\nSo you see how these\ndictionary files work.\n\n353\n00:17:41.005 --> 00:17:42.855\nIf the word's in the file,\nit's gonna crack it.\n\n354\n00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:46.255\nIf the word's not in the file,\ndepends on some of your mangling or\n\n355\n00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:49.520\nhybrid options It could still\nfind it by manipulating it,\n\n356\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.130\nchanging As to ats or\nadding numbers to the end of it.\n\n357\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.210\nSo that's a dictionary attack.\n\n358\n00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.558\nThe other one I want to talk about\nis known as a brute force attack.\n\n359\n00:17:57.558 --> 00:17:59.520\nAnd this is where you just\nthrow everything at it.\n\n360\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.200\nYou try every possible combination of\nletter, number, and special character.\n\n361\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.346\nSo I start with A, and\nthen AA, and then AAA.\n\n362\n00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:11.995\nAA1, AA2, AA$, just every\npossible combination of letters,\n\n363\n00:18:11.995 --> 00:18:14.288\nnumbers, special characters.\n\n364\n00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:17.950\n&gt;&gt; And you can specify certain parameters\nlike you had mentioned before.\n\n365\n00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.910\nSo let's say that if you know that\ncompany's password policy, and\n\n366\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.701\nyou know that they have a minimum of eight\ncharacters, and you could just start and\n\n367\n00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:29.284\nyou would just skin the A,\nthe AA, the AAA.\n\n368\n00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:31.869\nAnd all the way up and\nstart with the 8 characters, right?\n\n369\n00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:35.529\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz you're trying to reduce\nthe amount of time it's gonna take you to\n\n370\n00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:36.470\ncrack a password.\n\n371\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.520\nSo if you know something about\nit that can definitely help you.\n\n372\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.780\nI don't have to try every\nsingle combination,\n\n373\n00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.610\nI know some combinations are not gonna\nbe it, so let's not even try those.\n\n374\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.610\nLet's show you what I mean.\n\n375\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.487\nAnd this time I'm gonna go back\nto my hash calculator, and\n\n376\n00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:51.495\nI'm just gonna do something like this.\n\n377\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.734\nLet's zoom in there.\n\n378\n00:18:57.734 --> 00:19:01.020\nSo you can see capital P@$$.\n\n379\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.640\nReally short.\n\n380\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.730\nI wanna keep this,\nwe were on a limited time here.\n\n381\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.556\nI don't have 30,000 years to try\nto crack a complex password.\n\n382\n00:19:07.556 --> 00:19:10.210\nAnd I'll go ahead and hash that.\n\n383\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.400\nAnd we'll grab that MD5 value again.\n\n384\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.038\nGonna dump it in my list.\n\n385\n00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:20.655\nAnd there we are.\n\n386\n00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:23.850\nNow, this time I'm gonna\ndo a brute force attack.\n\n387\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.050\nI could do the dictionary attack,\nbut I know for\n\n388\n00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.510\na fact that word is not in my dictionary.\n\n389\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.820\nIf it's something that I\nthought users might be using,\n\n390\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.810\nthen I might add it to my dictionary and\nmake this a lot simpler.\n\n391\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.650\nBut if I don't have any\nidea what the password is,\n\n392\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.640\nI wanna do a brute force to try to\ntry every possible combination.\n\n393\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.320\nSo when I come into this dialog box,\nI see a few options here.\n\n394\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.170\nI've got predefined up at the top.\n\n395\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.010\nThis is my character set.\n\n396\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.600\nWhat are the possible\ncharacters in your password?\n\n397\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.270\nAs Cherokee was saying,\nif I know they only use uppercase and\n\n398\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.760\nlowercase letters,\nI can take away numbers and\n\n399\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.200\nspecial characters,\nreduces the over all character set.\n\n400\n00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.130\nThis one that there's chosen right\nnow is lowercase letters and\n\n401\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.660\nnumbers zero through nine.\n\n402\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.364\nOver their password length,\nminimum 1, maximum 16 and\n\n403\n00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:11.832\nyou can see the keyspace,\nthere's over 8.1 to the 24th power.\n\n404\n00:20:11.832 --> 00:20:15.992\n24 0s after that number there,\npossibilities.\n\n405\n00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:20.320\n[SOUND] I'm gonna Start it and Stop it\nreal quick just to show you something.\n\n406\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.903\nSo I'm gonna Start and then Stop,\nit won't let me do that.\n\n407\n00:20:24.903 --> 00:20:26.470\nI'm gonna Start it.\n\n408\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.295\nAnd let it run.\n\n409\n00:20:27.295 --> 00:20:30.717\nIt's not gonna get it because we\nknow there's no @ symbol in that\n\n410\n00:20:30.717 --> 00:20:33.781\ncharacter set but I wanna start it and\nshow you something.\n\n411\n00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:40.430\nThere a time left on there,\n4 to the 10th power years.\n\n412\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.500\nThat's a lot of years.\n\n413\n00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nI'll let you stay here for that.\n\n414\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.620\n&gt;&gt; My grandchildren's children might\nbe around when this finally cracks.\n\n415\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.960\nAnd that's because of\nthe number of possibilities.\n\n416\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.418\nLet's fix this though.\n\n417\n00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.860\nLet's say, well, I've got a little\nbit of info about this password.\n\n418\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.996\nI know that it's a minimum\nof four characters.\n\n419\n00:20:59.996 --> 00:21:00.496\nOops, I'm going the wrong way there.\n\n420\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.480\nAnd we're gonna say it’s\na maximum of eight characters..\n\n421\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.030\nNow, look at my key set, my key space,\nit's much, much smaller,\n\n422\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.920\nit’s no longer in scientific notation.\n\n423\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.600\nBut unfortunately I need to change\nmy character set as well because\n\n424\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.930\nthis does not include the special\ncharacters that I know might be.\n\n425\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.320\nLet's say cuz I know Company XYZ\nenforces strong passwords.\n\n426\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.920\nThat means there's probably some\nspecial characters in there.\n\n427\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.890\nSo I'm gonna choose a character\nset that has all of that.\n\n428\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.600\nAnd once I choose that,\nnow look at my key space.\n\n429\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.640\nEven though I reduced the total\nnumber of password length.\n\n430\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.150\nAnd increase the number of\ncharacters that are possible so\n\n431\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.440\nit jumped key space way back up there.\n\n432\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.170\nIf I start this up, it's gonna again\nbe an exponential value of years.\n\n433\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.508\nSo we're gonna fine-tune it\na little more for the show.\n\n434\n00:21:55.508 --> 00:21:59.293\nLet's see how I can do this.\n\n435\n00:21:59.293 --> 00:22:02.690\nWe're gonna go Custom.\n\n436\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.770\nNow, watch the numbers\nchange as I do this.\n\n437\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.490\nI'm gonna take away all\nthose lower case letters.\n\n438\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.540\nSee how it dropped?\n\n439\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.180\nI'm gonna take away the numbers.\n\n440\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.340\nI know there's no numbers in this one.\n\n441\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.670\n&gt;&gt; So what you're showing us essentially\nis just how important it is to have those\n\n442\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.060\ncomplex passwords.\n\n443\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n444\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.190\nAnd there's at symbols and dollar signs.\n\n445\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.410\nWe'll take a few of these\nspecial characters out, and\n\n446\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.140\nnow I've got it down to\nsomething reasonable.\n\n447\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.960\nHeck, I can even drop the link down,\n\n448\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.480\ncuz I know it's not more than,\nwe'll say six just to have fun.\n\n449\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.710\nI'll say it's at least three.\n\n450\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.130\nAnd so,\nI've really reduced the number of chances.\n\n451\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.978\nAnd I know if my computer can\ndo over 2 million per second,\n\n452\n00:22:41.978 --> 00:22:44.374\nthis is a number that I\ncan definitely live with.\n\n453\n00:22:44.374 --> 00:22:47.780\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll see how long it takes.\n\n454\n00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.630\nStart-\n&gt;&gt; I guess it really is an odds game,\n\n455\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.510\nbecause it will happen.\n\n456\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.530\nIt's just when.\n\n457\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.310\n&gt;&gt; It's just when.\n\n458\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.940\nSo I mean, it happened almost instantly.\n\n459\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.150\nNow, I happen to know a lot about\nthe password, which in the real world,\n\n460\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:22:59.690\nwe might not.\n\n461\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.770\nAnd we've gotta try more\nof those possibilities.\n\n462\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.660\nAnd we've gotta just let it run longer.\n\n463\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.730\nBut it sure did crack it.\n\n464\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.300\nIf we look up here, it popped it.\n\n465\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.590\nThere is that password.\n\n466\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.120\nSo that's the idea behind\na brute force attack.\n\n467\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.830\nThe key to brute force attacks,\n\n468\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.640\nis try to figure out as much as you can,\nabout the password.\n\n469\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.930\nLike I might shoulder surf, and\nwatch Cherokee type her password in.\n\n470\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.990\nAnd I notice she never hit the shift key.\n\n471\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.483\nAnd she never hit the number row.\n\n472\n00:23:24.483 --> 00:23:28.804\nSo I'm pretty safe in assuming\nthat there's all lower case and\n\n473\n00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:33.941\nupper case letters and maybe some\nspecial characters like the semicolon or\n\n474\n00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:36.401\nthe period or something like that.\n\n475\n00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:40.264\nBut I never saw her hit shift, so\nit can't be greater or less than symbols.\n\n476\n00:23:40.264 --> 00:23:41.131\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm a ninja.\n\n477\n00:23:41.131 --> 00:23:41.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Things like that,\n\n478\n00:23:41.994 --> 00:23:43.300\nunless you're a ninja.\n\n479\n00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.390\nSo I can try to whittle that down,\nor during my footprinting phase,\n\n480\n00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.218\nI find out about the organization's\npassword policy.\n\n481\n00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:54.358\nI wait until a bunch of the employees\ngo across the street after work.\n\n482\n00:23:54.358 --> 00:23:55.579\nThey're sitting at the bar.\n\n483\n00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:57.209\nI belly up next to them.\n\n484\n00:23:57.209 --> 00:24:02.000\nAnd I start whining to myself God.\n\n485\n00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.179\nWe gotta change our\npassword every 90 days.\n\n486\n00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:05.380\nIt drives me crazy.\n\n487\n00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.470\nThe guy next to me from the company I'm\ntrying to find out about says, 90 days?\n\n488\n00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:14.210\nShoot, we gotta change ours every 30 days\nand it has to be ten characters long.\n\n489\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.710\nTry to deal with that.\n\n490\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.760\nWell I just learned what their companies\npassword policy is, or part of it, right?\n\n491\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.380\nAnd then I start talking to him\nabout his dogs and his cats and-\n\n492\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:22.930\n&gt;&gt; Are those your normal\n\n493\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.485\ntype of conversations?\n\n494\n00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:25.238\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it works pretty well.\n\n495\n00:24:25.238 --> 00:24:30.930\n[LAUGH] All right,\ngood old social engineering at its finest.\n\n496\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.010\nAll right, enough about that.\n\n497\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.510\nI've shown you a couple examples, we've\ntalked about the main thing here that they\n\n498\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.295\ncall out is understanding what\na dictionary attack is using a word list.\n\n499\n00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:40.505\nIt's just one word on each line.\n\n500\n00:24:40.505 --> 00:24:43.365\nIt's not a special type of file,\nyou can make your own,\n\n501\n00:24:43.365 --> 00:24:46.395\nyou can search the Internet,\nyou can find all kinds of words lists.\n\n502\n00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:49.735\nI have tools that will scour\nyour organization's website, and\n\n503\n00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:53.595\npull words, I can set it to say\nanything over four letters.\n\n504\n00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:56.435\nAnd every word that's over\nfour letters in your code and\n\n505\n00:24:56.435 --> 00:24:59.130\nin your website, will be added to a file.\n\n506\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.100\nWhy would I do that?\n\n507\n00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.150\n&gt;&gt; For like an industry standard lexicon?\n\n508\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.470\nLike if you had a specific type\nof verbiage that you used?\n\n509\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n510\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.150\nThere could be acronyms, industry standard\nterms, that some of your employees\n\n511\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.573\nare gonna think,\nnobody knows what a whatchamajiggy is.\n\n512\n00:25:13.573 --> 00:25:14.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n513\n00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.480\nI'm gonna use whatchamajiggy\nas my password.\n\n514\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.600\nWell, I'm just gonna scrape that off of\nyour website and then add it to my already\n\n515\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.950\nhuge dictionary of things to try,\nmutate it a little bit if I feel like it.\n\n516\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.930\nAnd hopefully crack your password, or\n\n517\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.220\nagain I guess it should be saying this\nfrom the security side of things,\n\n518\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.790\nverify that my employees\nare not using weak passwords.\n\n519\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea.\n\n520\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.520\nYes.\n\n521\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.200\nAll right, let's take a look at\na solution on the Linux side of things.\n\n522\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.580\nWe don't wanna leave that out.\n\n523\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.460\nBut the concepts are exactly the same.\n\n524\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.560\nThere's no difference.\n\n525\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.810\nIt's just the tools I\nuse might be different.\n\n526\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.760\nIn Windows,\nwe're talking about the SAM file or\n\n527\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.580\nsniffing them off the network or\ngetting them out of Active Directory.\n\n528\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.930\nIn Linux, we're looking at\nthe password file or the shadow file.\n\n529\n00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.310\nMost of them now have split\nthat off into the shadow file.\n\n530\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.660\nThey used to all be stored\nin the password file.\n\n531\n00:26:09.428 --> 00:26:10.800\nThey are no longer stored here.\n\n532\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.675\nThis is just information about what users\nexist, groups they belong too, things like\n\n533\n00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:22.245\nthat, they've separated out the password\ninto the, let's do the shadow file.\n\n534\n00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:27.375\nAll right and here are our passwords.\n\n535\n00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:31.695\nNow I've got a few accounts set up on\nhere that we're going to attempt to crack\n\n536\n00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:33.425\nlike Han, and Luke.\n\n537\n00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:39.095\nBut this right is their hash,\nor some of these are,\n\n538\n00:26:39.095 --> 00:26:44.350\nthat is the As value\nthe representation of their password.\n\n539\n00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.940\nSo here I'm gonna use a program called\nJohn, another one that's been around for\n\n540\n00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.010\na long time John the Ripper,\nits a fantastic command line utility\n\n541\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.750\nthat allows me to crack passwords,\nhas several different options.\n\n542\n00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.750\nLike single is an interesting one,\nit will take,\n\n543\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.440\nit looks at the user account that you're\ntrying to crack, uses the user name,\n\n544\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.460\nthe home directory path and\nthen mangles it.\n\n545\n00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.490\nBecause a lot of times our users use\nsome combination of their user name for\n\n546\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.840\ntheir passwords.\n\n547\n00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.155\nSo it tries that first, then it moves\non into a, if you do the default,\n\n548\n00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:18.125\nit does single crack mode first,\nand then it does word list.\n\n549\n00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:21.595\nAnd you can either use the default word\nlist that comes with John the Ripper, or\n\n550\n00:27:21.595 --> 00:27:25.372\nyou can provide your own word list\nwith a dash dash word list equals.\n\n551\n00:27:25.372 --> 00:27:29.412\nAnd if that doesn't work, and\nit doesn't crack the password, then\n\n552\n00:27:29.412 --> 00:27:33.222\nit'll go into what we call incremental,\nwhich is the brute force attack.\n\n553\n00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:34.032\nAll right?\n\n554\n00:27:34.032 --> 00:27:36.402\nAnd very customizable about\nhow it goes about this,\n\n555\n00:27:36.402 --> 00:27:40.362\nwhat rules it's using,\nhow it's modifying, things like that.\n\n556\n00:27:40.362 --> 00:27:43.202\nWe're just gonna use it in its\ndefault mode cuz I know it's\n\n557\n00:27:43.202 --> 00:27:47.250\ngonna jump over to the default\nword list pretty quick and\n\n558\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.770\nthe passwords I used were\nintentionally in that word list.\n\n559\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.380\nSo that we didn't have to\nwait all day to see it work.\n\n560\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.990\nBut it's just basically John,\n\n561\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:00.020\ntell it where the file is and\nI'm not even gonna bother\n\n562\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.036\nunshadowing it to tie back it back to\nthe user end thing I'm just gonna run it.\n\n563\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.810\nAnd let it go.\n\n564\n00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.450\nAnd so\nwhat it's doing now is it's looking again,\n\n565\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.550\nit's doing the single crack mode\nwhere it's mangling the username.\n\n566\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.600\nI say mangle, append characters,\nnumbers to it, uppercase and\n\n567\n00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.140\nlower case it, leet speak it.\n\n568\n00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.380\n&gt;&gt; Transpose.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n569\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.260\n&gt;&gt; And then the same thing\n\n570\n00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.060\nwith the home directory path, it does\nthe same thing with the words there.\n\n571\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.710\nAnd then it moves on into the answer file,\nor the, I'm sorry the dictionary file,\n\n572\n00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.970\nthe word list.\n\n573\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.430\nAnd there it goes, you can see it's\npopping them pretty quick now.\n\n574\n00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.990\nAlso notice it's in alphabetical order,\nthe order that I popped them in.\n\n575\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.520\nBecause it's going through the word list,\none at a time, right?\n\n576\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.280\nAnd it's getting, I say that, and then\nit pulls Jedi at the end, interesting.\n\n577\n00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.270\nI'm gonna stop it there,\n\n578\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.650\nbecause it's not gonna get my root\npassword, at least with the word list.\n\n579\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.530\nIt would eventually get it\nwith the brute force, but\n\n580\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.370\nwe don't wanna wait around for that.\n\n581\n00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.300\nMy fans will start\nkicking in on my machine.\n\n582\n00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.800\nIt takes a lot of processing power\nto start doing that type of attack.\n\n583\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.630\nIt's something you can offload to GPU,\nif you've got the system setup for that.\n\n584\n00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:08.410\nRight there, we can see that it broke\nall four of those passwords and\n\n585\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.990\ngranted those are simple passwords,\nbut it did the trick.\n\n586\n00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:17.330\nSo another thing you can do with John\nis once you've cracked the passwords\n\n587\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:22.430\nyou should be able to do a john--show and\nthen the file that you just cracked.\n\n588\n00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.450\nAnd there it shows me the mapping.\n\n589\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:33.520\nI can see the test has a password of\npassword, Han has a password of Star Wars,\n\n590\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.535\nLuke used Jedi, and Leia used princess.\n\n591\n00:29:37.535 --> 00:29:39.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So predictable those rebels.\n\n592\n00:29:39.515 --> 00:29:41.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those darn rebels.\n\n593\n00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.670\nGotta teach them to use strong passwords.\n\n594\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.380\nSo there's a look at breaking passwords on\nboth the Windows side and the Linux side.\n\n595\n00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.660\nAnd different types of password\nattacks that we should be aware of and\n\n596\n00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.680\nthat we wanna try to defend.\n\n597\n00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.910\nThis is what our password\npolicies do right.\n\n598\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.820\nIf we talk about defending against\nthese attacks what do we do?\n\n599\n00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.140\nOne we make sure we're not using\na word that’s found in the dictionary,\n\n600\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.470\nthat’s just too darn easy.\n\n601\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:11.450\nAnd then we make sure its complex so that\na brute force attack has to go through,\n\n602\n00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.140\nwe want upper case and\nlower case and numbers and\n\n603\n00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.850\nspecial characters as\npart of that password.\n\n604\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.210\nSo you can't reduce the character\nset to speed this up.\n\n605\n00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.540\nAnd then if it's 8 to 10\nto 12 characters long,\n\n606\n00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.810\nit's just gonna take a long time to crack.\n\n607\n00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:31.330\nNow keep in mind if it tells me that it's\ngonna take 40,000 years to crack, right.\n\n608\n00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.030\nWell, that's if it's the last guess I try.\n\n609\n00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.240\nThere's always the chance that I get\nit on the third guess, and I get that\n\n610\n00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.995\n10 character password like that, but the\nodds are against me when it comes to that.\n\n611\n00:30:43.995 --> 00:30:47.575\nSo longer, complex passwords\nare going to save the day.\n\n612\n00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:49.095\n&gt;&gt; But the force is with you [LAUGH].\n\n613\n00:30:49.095 --> 00:30:51.465\n&gt;&gt; Yes, pass phrases right,\nare another thing?\n\n614\n00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:54.405\nI can use, and I'll tell you it's funny,\ncuz you start looking at this,\n\n615\n00:30:54.405 --> 00:30:56.165\nand you think, okay don't use words.\n\n616\n00:30:56.165 --> 00:30:58.261\nGotta make it complex, hard to remember.\n\n617\n00:30:58.261 --> 00:31:01.535\nPass phrases, I don't know,\n\n618\n00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:06.650\ntake your favorite poem,\nMary had a little lamb, and type that out.\n\n619\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.760\nWell it's not a single word.\n\n620\n00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.630\nIt's not gonna be cracked\nby many dictionary files.\n\n621\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.290\nIt's umpteen characters long so\nit's gonna take a while.\n\n622\n00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.310\nReplace a couple letters with capitals,\n\n623\n00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.510\nthrow in a couple special characters,\neasy to remember.\n\n624\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.535\nAnd relatively strong.\n\n625\n00:31:21.535 --> 00:31:23.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well thank you for\nthat advice there, Mike.\n\n626\n00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.700\nBut I think we do have several other\naccess control methods to cover.\n\n627\n00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.830\nWhat, we're already out of part two?\n\n628\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.510\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking for part three.\n\n629\n00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.720\nAll right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n630\n00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.170\nCuz like Mike said,\nwe have more information to cover.\n\n631\n00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.558\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for this show.\n\n632\n00:31:37.558 --> 00:31:38.736\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n633\n00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:39.736\n&gt;&gt; I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n634\n00:31:39.736 --> 00:31:43.866\n&gt;&gt; See you here

00:00:08.428\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:12.629\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.525\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.580\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.340\nAnd we've made it to a part three,\n\n8\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.470\nwhere we're gonna be looking at\nmore access control methods.\n\n9\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130\nWith us today, we have mister\nMike Rodrick in the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.495\nThank for joining us today, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:27.440\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.097\nThanks for having me back,\neven though yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:31.030\nI haven't been able to finish\nin the first two parts.\n\n14\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.660\n&gt;&gt; Give me one more try here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.410\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.980\nContinuing on with good\nol' access control,\n\n17\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.790\nwe've taken a look at Some access control\nmethods, we looked at password cracking.\n\n18\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.896\nNext thing they call it on the objectives,\nthings we wanna talk about here,\n\n19\n00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:46.382\nother forms or\nalternate forms of authentication, right?\n\n20\n00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:50.489\nWe all know that the most common\nauthentication method is user name and\n\n21\n00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.380\npassword, it's easy to implement,\nit's built into most of our systems.\n\n22\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.934\nWe also should note at this point\nthat it's one of the weakest forms of\n\n23\n00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.857\nauthentication we can use as well,\ndue to letting the users create their own\n\n24\n00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:05.453\npasswords they don't\ncreate strong passwords.\n\n25\n00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:07.880\nThey reuse, the list goes on and on.\n\n26\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.860\nThey write them down.\n\n27\n00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.960\nThey reuse them.\n\n28\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690\nAnd I'm not blaming the end user.\n\n29\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.080\nI mean, it's kind of a pain.\n\n30\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650\nEven for trained security professionals,\n\n31\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.450\nit's like how many different\npasswords do I have?\n\n32\n00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.790\nThey've all gotta be different,\nI can't reuse them anywhere,\n\n33\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330\nI really shouldn't write them down,\nI mean it could be a challenge.\n\n34\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.820\nBut there are other forms of\nauthentication that we can use and\n\n35\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.090\nsome of these are taking root and\nbeing seen more often\n\n36\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.120\nin the enterprise environment especially\nas they become more widely implemented.\n\n37\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.812\nIt's the whole supply and\ndemand thing, right.\n\n38\n00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:45.057\nAs they become more implemented, more\ncompanies need to buy this card reader, or\n\n39\n00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:47.430\nscanner, or whatever the case may be.\n\n40\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.060\nSo they have to manufacture more,\nthey're picking up some more of them,\n\n41\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.950\nthe assembly lines get converted over,\nprice goes down,\n\n42\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.590\nmore people buy them,\nyou get the idea, right?\n\n43\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.660\n&gt;&gt; You know what I've been seeing a lot\nlately is companies are taking advantage\n\n44\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.730\nof mobile devices.\n\n45\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.940\nSo if they say, they give you an option,\n\n46\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.320\nwhat would be your secondary\nform of authentication?\n\n47\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.110\nLike do you want me to send a passcode\nto a particular phone number?\n\n48\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.695\nAnd then when you get that text message\nyou have to, for dual authentication, and\n\n49\n00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.626\nthat's really been kind of trendy I guess,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:20.939\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for a lot of these websites it's\na one way they can try to verify you\n\n51\n00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.373\nare who you say you are.\n\n52\n00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:25.705\nYou type in your username and\npassword, and they say all right,\n\n53\n00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:29.099\nwell I'm gonna send you this code\nto your chosen mobile device and\n\n54\n00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.500\nhopefully you haven't lost your password\nto this website and your mobile device.\n\n55\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.790\nAnd we can verify that it's you there.\n\n56\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.870\nSo absolutely, a big one that we\nsee nowadays is Biometrics right.\n\n57\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.745\nWe're seeing this more and more.\n\n58\n00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.728\nWhen it comes to authentication\nthere's really three things I can base\n\n59\n00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.280\nauthentication on.\n\n60\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.280\nSomething you have, something you know,\nor something you are.\n\n61\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.330\nSomething you have might be a token,\nwe're gonna talk about those in a minute.\n\n62\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.790\nSomething you know,\nyou know your password for example.\n\n63\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.810\nSomething you are would be\nBiometrics based on you, yourself.\n\n64\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.732\nAnd this could be anywhere\nfrom a fingerprint scanner to\n\n65\n00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:12.140\na iris scanner or\nretina scanner, voice prints.\n\n66\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.660\nI don't know can you think of any others,\nCherokee?\n\n67\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.260\nI know there's a ton more.\n\n68\n00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.170\n&gt;&gt; You said fingerprint.\n\n69\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.700\nWhat about palm, maybe?\n\n70\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, palm prints would be one.\n\n71\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.660\nI've seen vascular recognition\nsystems where it actually is looking\n\n72\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.610\nsubdermally at your blood vessels,\nbecause that's a unique pattern in there.\n\n73\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.670\nI saw one show where they actually\npicked up the vascular pattern\n\n74\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.292\nfrom a camera in a bank as\nthe gentleman held out the gun.\n\n75\n00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:37.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n76\n00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.770\n&gt;&gt; To hold them up.\n\n77\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.710\nThey were able to zoom in the arms, yeah,\n\n78\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.740\nthat's a little far-fetched,\nwe're not quite there yet.\n\n79\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.039\nBut there are systems with boxes that you\nput your hand in, and it does take a look\n\n80\n00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.762\nusing other forms of light than regular\nlight to see into your skin and\n\n81\n00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:53.640\nthe vessels, it's really cool.\n\n82\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.916\nBut the idea is very\ndifficult to impersonate.\n\n83\n00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:01.315\nWe know a fingerprint is pretty unique.\n\n84\n00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:05.258\nSo if I'm using that for\nidentification or for\n\n85\n00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:10.130\nauthentication, it's hard to fake,\nor is it, right?\n\n86\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.348\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n87\n00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:13.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, one thing I don't know,\ndid we mention facial recognition?\n\n88\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.730\n&gt;&gt; We didn't.\n\n89\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI didn't know if you were going there.\n\n90\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.110\nBecause when that first came out,\nit was so easy,\n\n91\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.738\nyou could just hold up a photograph.\n\n92\n00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:24.540\nBut now consumer-grade facial\nrecognition has improved but\n\n93\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.650\nit's not near like what you see for\ngovernmental use, and\n\n94\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.240\nentities, like in larger airports,\nsomething that they may use.\n\n95\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.562\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that was my point as I said,\nor are they?\n\n96\n00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:37.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, it's a great example,\n\n97\n00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:41.771\nyou look at facial recognition, and if I\ncan take I had a laptop, an old Alienware\n\n98\n00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:45.820\nthat if it wasn't my face in front of\nthe screen it would lock the screen.\n\n99\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.090\nAnd if I sat down in front of it, it would\nunlock the screen, but you could also\n\n100\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.480\ntake a picture of me, a nice six by eight,\nor eight by ten, or something.\n\n101\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.237\nHold it up there, and it would unlock the\nscreen cuz there was no check for life,\n\n102\n00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:57.741\nright?\n\n103\n00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:02.130\nIt wasn't checking three-dimensionality,\nor anything like that.\n\n104\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.300\nEarly fingerprint scanners\ncould be easily faked.\n\n105\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.960\nWith gummy worms, things like this.\n\n106\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.780\nBecause again,\nthere was no check for life.\n\n107\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.740\nSo, and we realized that early on, and\nso now they incorporate things like\n\n108\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.180\nlooking for a heart beat while you've\ngot your finger in there or temperature.\n\n109\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.646\n&gt;&gt; Are you on Snapchat?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n110\n00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:20.436\n&gt;&gt; You are?\n\n111\n00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:24.216\nOkay, so you know how they have those\nlittle funny, what are they called,\n\n112\n00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:24.938\nthe filters?\n\n113\n00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:29.829\nWhere it does the facial recognition,\nand its kind of weird because I remember\n\n114\n00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.944\nreading an article where they were storing\nthe facial recognition information,\n\n115\n00:05:34.944 --> 00:05:39.687\nwhich could potentially be a security\nbreach further on down the line if more\n\n116\n00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:43.860\ncompanies adopt facial recognition\nas a form of authentication.\n\n117\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.030\nBecause now one company has all\nthese different facial coordinates,\n\n118\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.490\nand it's kind of something to think about.\n\n119\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.680\nIt's fun to look-alike little animals and\ncharacters, but\n\n120\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.900\nwhat are they doing with that information?\n\n121\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.942\n&gt;&gt; Did I say I used to use Snapchat?\n\n122\n00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:59.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what I said?\n\n123\n00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:00.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n124\n00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.292\nI'm not a complete paranoid individual,\nbut\n\n125\n00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:03.686\nit just makes you think sometimes, right?\n\n126\n00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:06.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but at this point it's too late.\n\n127\n00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.205\nHaving these street cameras,\nmall cameras, security cameras.\n\n128\n00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:10.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, they're everywhere.\n\n129\n00:06:10.327 --> 00:06:12.235\n&gt;&gt; Being turned to the NSA and\nthey've got us anyway.\n\n130\n00:06:12.235 --> 00:06:14.542\nSo hey, here's my smiley face.\n\n131\n00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:15.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.596\nYou can do with it what you want.\n\n133\n00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:17.796\n&gt;&gt; You're on camera right now.\n\n134\n00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:18.463\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n135\n00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:23.369\n[LAUGH] But biometrics based on\nsomething are the ideas it should be\n\n136\n00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:27.439\nmore difficult to impersonate you,\nif it's your finger print or\n\n137\n00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:31.660\nyour voice print, but\nall these systems have draw backs too.\n\n138\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.970\nFingerprints can be fake.\n\n139\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.530\nThey can be obtained pretty easily.\n\n140\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.380\nI follow you around, you touch all\nkinds of things, all day long.\n\n141\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.760\nI can get that.\n\n142\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.800\nVoice prints.\n\n143\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.830\nWhat if you come into work the next day,\nyou're sick, and\n\n144\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.380\nyou can't authenticate to your computer,\nget your work done cuz you can't talk?\n\n145\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.633\n&gt;&gt; And some individuals even say retinal\nscans are too invasive because they may\n\n146\n00:06:52.633 --> 00:06:56.298\nobtain a medical information because\nit can pick up on cataract and\n\n147\n00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:57.359\nthings like that.\n\n148\n00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:59.500\nSo it's invading on privacy.\n\n149\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.210\nSo there's a lot to really think about.\n\n150\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and with a Reva Scan for example\nyou have to get the camera at least with\n\n151\n00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.335\nmost technologies get the camera\npretty close to your eye.\n\n152\n00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:11.198\nSo think about going up\nto an ATM machine and\n\n153\n00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:14.580\nyou've got to put your eye on this camera.\n\n154\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.760\nWho used it before you do you want\nyour eye touching that rubber ring?\n\n155\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.464\n&gt;&gt; And who's behind you while\nyou're doing that right?\n\n156\n00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:19.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n157\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.510\nyeah so maybe that's not the best and\nlike you said it could see other things.\n\n158\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.100\nIf you're not familiar with retina scans\nwe're looking at the blood vessel pattern\n\n159\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.214\non the back of your eye your\nretina on the back of your eye.\n\n160\n00:07:31.214 --> 00:07:35.519\nIris scans however looking at the color\nparts which they theorize is just unique\n\n161\n00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:40.145\nas a finger print can be captured through\nglasses, which you can't do with a retina,\n\n162\n00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:44.540\nyou gotta take your glasses off, at least\nagain, with the current technology.\n\n163\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.878\nSo iris scans can be a few feet away,\nthey can go through glasses, so\n\n164\n00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.775\nmaybe this is a better solution for\nlike ATMs.\n\n165\n00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:57.869\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're wearing smart contact\nlenses which, that's another whole realm.\n\n166\n00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:59.455\nThere.\n&gt;&gt; Colored contacts.\n\n167\n00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:01.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got the split pupils that\n\n168\n00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.377\neverybody likes to wear.\n\n169\n00:08:02.377 --> 00:08:05.810\nLittle figure eights or hourglass shapes.\n\n170\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.920\nAll that fun stuff.\n\n171\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.720\nSo biometrics again, is a new or newer,\nI shouldn't say new, it's been around for\n\n172\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.140\nawhile, but we're seeing it more and more.\n\n173\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.470\nBut typically not on its on.\n\n174\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.734\nI mean that's the thing we want to\nunderstand is biometric's gonna replace\n\n175\n00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:21.670\npasswords or something like that?\n\n176\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.990\nPossibly, but\n\n177\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.580\nodds are we'll actually use them as\na multi-factor authentication method.\n\n178\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.870\nWhere we have single factor, all I have\nto do is put in my password, right?\n\n179\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.650\nThat's one factor of authentication.\n\n180\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.850\nIt's based on something I know,\nmy password.\n\n181\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.440\nWell, if we combine it\nwith something you are,\n\n182\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.680\nnow we're checking something you know and\nsomething you are.\n\n183\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.690\nThat's multi factor authentication.\n\n184\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.240\nI have to type my password in and\ndo an iris scan or a voice print or\n\n185\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.370\na fingerprint scan or something like that.\n\n186\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.260\nOr maybe I have to type in a pin and\nprovide a card that I can swipe.\n\n187\n00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.590\nThis would be multi-factor because it's\nbased on something I know, the pin, and\n\n188\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.360\nsomething I have,\nthe card that I have to swipe.\n\n189\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.270\nKeep in mind, when they say multi-factor,\nif it's type in a pin which prompts you to\n\n190\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.780\nanother screen that says,\nwhat's the answer to the secret question?\n\n191\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.930\nThat is not multi-factor authentication.\n\n192\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.499\nIt is kind of, but it's not what we\nmean by multi-factor authentication\n\n193\n00:09:20.499 --> 00:09:23.088\nbecause it's still based on one factor.\n\n194\n00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:27.147\nBoth of those are based on something\nyou know, your password and\n\n195\n00:09:27.147 --> 00:09:29.489\nthe answer to your secret question.\n\n196\n00:09:29.489 --> 00:09:33.640\nSo it's not requiring two\ndifferent types of authentication.\n\n197\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.270\nNeeds to be from two of those\nthree categories at least.\n\n198\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.520\nAnd you could do three factor\nauthentication if you really\n\n199\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.080\nwanted to, all right?\n\n200\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.990\nSo that's the idea behind biometrics.\n\n201\n00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.050\nTokens are another one that we can use.\n\n202\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.890\nTokens are something you have, like again,\n\n203\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.790\nRFID cards or smart cards or-\n&gt;&gt; Even apps on phones nowadays,\n\n204\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.640\nthat are just constantly changing.\n\n205\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those could be your tokens.\n\n206\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.040\nYou've got secure keys and\nthings like that that generate tokens.\n\n207\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.930\nThe idea behind a token, it's just,\nagain, something you have,\n\n208\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.620\nwhich is another factor of authentication.\n\n209\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.170\nNow another concept that kind of goes\nalong with tokens we want to talk about\n\n210\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.370\nhere is something known as single sign on.\n\n211\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.570\nSingle sign on is a way that\nI can authenticate once, and\n\n212\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.930\naccess more than one resource.\n\n213\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.590\nImagine a system where every file you\nclicked on, or every folder you tried\n\n214\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.350\nto open, and then every file you clicked\non, you had to re-insert your password, or\n\n215\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.530\nwhatever authentication\nmethod you were using.\n\n216\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.370\nIt'd be a real pain in the you know what,\nright?\n\n217\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.400\nSingle sign on says, hey,\nlet's let them sign on once and\n\n218\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.600\nthen allow them to access all this other\nstuff without having to reauthenticate.\n\n219\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.350\nWell, how can I do that?\n\n220\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.160\nWhat I'm going to do is when you\nauthenticate that first time successfully,\n\n221\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.290\nI'm going to give you a token.\n\n222\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.010\nI'm going to give you proof\nthat you've authenticated.\n\n223\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.940\nAnd now when you go to re\naccess other resources\n\n224\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.690\nyou can just show them your token.\n\n225\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.430\nAnd you could say, look,\nI've already authenticated.\n\n226\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.360\nAnd my token was issued by\nsomebody that you trust.\n\n227\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.180\nThat's the key to it, right?\n\n228\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.970\nWhen you're in\nan Active Directory environment,\n\n229\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.520\nyou sign on in the morning at work and\nyou get your access token.\n\n230\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.489\nAnd then when you go to access resources,\n\n231\n00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:20.330\nyou present your access token to this\nresource, trying to get a session ticket.\n\n232\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.775\nAnd the server looks at that\naccess token and says, all right,\n\n233\n00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:28.538\nit says you've been validated and you\nwere authenticated by dc01.lab.itprotv.\n\n234\n00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:31.730\nWait, I'm in lab.itprotv,\nI trust that domain controller.\n\n235\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.970\nThere's a trust relationship established.\n\n236\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.030\nI'm gonna trust he did\nthe authentication properly.\n\n237\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.470\nI'll accept the token, right?\n\n238\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.040\nI was trying to think of a good,\nanother example in the real world.\n\n239\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.260\nYou go to a fair and\n\n240\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.230\nyou buy a ticket that allows you\nto access all the different rides.\n\n241\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.120\nYou don't have to buy individual\ntickets for each ride, right?\n\n242\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.050\nYou can just show them your ticket.\n\n243\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.580\nHey, yes, that's the ticket\nwe issue at the front booth.\n\n244\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.250\nI trust that and I'll let you\naccess this ride, for example.\n\n245\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.405\nSo I mean something like that might\nbe considered single sign-on, but\n\n246\n00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:01.880\nwe see this a lot.\n\n247\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.310\nFederation services allows us to do\nsingle sign-on, because what happens if\n\n248\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.045\na user at XYZ Corporation,\nwants to access resources on my network?\n\n249\n00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:14.610\nWhen he got to work, they logged on, but\n\n250\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.810\nthey were authenticated\nby their domain control.\n\n251\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.090\nOr their network, whatever that might be.\n\n252\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.790\nAnd when they come over to access my web\nserver, if they try to show that token, my\n\n253\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.670\nweb server is gonna be like, I don't know\nwho authenticated you but I don't them.\n\n254\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.430\nSo I'm not gonna trust it.\n\n255\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.480\nFederation says let's set up\na trust between organizations.\n\n256\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.140\nI'm gonna trust your\nauthentication process and so\n\n257\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.290\nwhen your users come to me and\npresent their authentication token that\n\n258\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.140\nthey obtained on their network, I'm\njust gonna go ahead and say that, yeah,\n\n259\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.780\nI know the guy that did that\nauthentication, I will trust this token\n\n260\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.370\nand I will accept it even though it\nwasn't issued by our organization, right?\n\n261\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.540\nThat gives single sign on.\n\n262\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.290\nNow, that sales person, when they're\ncalling to check on the order of raw\n\n263\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.640\nmaterials, doesn't have to\nhave a second username and\n\n264\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.240\npassword that he has to authenticate\nto my web server with, right?\n\n265\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.515\nThat's the idea again by single sign-on.\n\n266\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.890\nAnother concept we want to talk about,\nRADIUS.\n\n267\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.870\nRADIUS is my Remote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n268\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.760\n&gt;&gt; What a mouth full.\n\n269\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.670\nYeah, it is, isn't it?\n\n270\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.470\nIt's kind of fun to say.\n\n271\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.350\n&gt;&gt; It is, RADIUS.\n\n272\n00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.581\n&gt;&gt; Remote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n273\n00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:21.213\nYou can probably tell by the name that\nit's been around for a little while,\n\n274\n00:13:21.213 --> 00:13:22.390\nif you heard what I said.\n\n275\n00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Dial-in?\n\n276\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, dial-in, right.\n\n277\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.600\nThis was initially done with older,\ndial-up,\n\n278\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.080\nremote access connections is when this was\ndeveloped and just kept the name, RADIUS.\n\n279\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.040\nAnd RADIUS is a platform independent term.\n\n280\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.769\nOrganizations have their own\nimplementation of RADIUS.\n\n281\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.405\nMicrosoft uses its network access servers,\n\n282\n00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:47.870\ntheir network policy server,\ntheir VPN servers, in combination.\n\n283\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.330\nCISCO has TACACS and TACACS+,\nwhich is a RADIUS solution, so\n\n284\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.890\nRADIUS is kind of an independent term.\n\n285\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes you'll even hear\nthe term, in authentication server.\n\n286\n00:13:56.925 --> 00:13:58.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, exactly.\n\n287\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.360\nSo what the heck is RADIUS?\n\n288\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.810\nWell, I've got a drawing,\nvery simple diagram that I drew up here,\n\n289\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.675\nto kind of try to show us\nwhat is meant by RADIUS or\n\n290\n00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:12.260\nRemote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n291\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.300\nAnd if we think about it, Remote\nAuthentication Dial-In User Service,\n\n292\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.530\nwe are using this for remote access,\nit used to be dialing in, and\n\n293\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.920\nwe want to provide the user remote access\nservice or access to the network remotely.\n\n294\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.320\nSo we are going to authenticate them but\nthey are remote from our network.\n\n295\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.880\nSo I've got my remote access client.\n\n296\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.730\nAnd the way this used to work,\nis if I, let's do this.\n\n297\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.320\nIf we got rid of this guy, and\nwe just hide him for a minute.\n\n298\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.920\nAnd we move this over to here.\n\n299\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.150\nYour remote access client,\nyou could be at the hotel, your home,\n\n300\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.340\nStarbucks, whatever, would attempt\nto make a remote access connection.\n\n301\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.460\nThey would connect to your\nremote access server.\n\n302\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.910\nAnd when that server provides\nremote access services\n\n303\n00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.110\nto your remote access client.\n\n304\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.840\nThis remote access server\nwould authenticate you.\n\n305\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.330\nYou'd type in your username and password.\n\n306\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.010\nIt would have to validate that\nwith the domain controller or\n\n307\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.190\nwhatever your authentication service was.\n\n308\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.620\nIt would have the policies that\nwould decide whether or not hey,\n\n309\n00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.340\nit's between nine and five,\nMike should be at work.\n\n310\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.020\nHe shouldn't be making remote access\nconnections, so I'm not gonna allow it.\n\n311\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.860\nOr Mike's dialling in from a number that\nwe don't know, it's not gonna allow.\n\n312\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.480\nSo the policies would be stored here, the\nauthentication process was initiated here.\n\n313\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.850\nThe problem with that is,\nwhere is this server?\n\n314\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.690\nCherokee, what do you think\nthese two red things are?\n\n315\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.580\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be firewalls, right?\n\n316\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.320\n&gt;&gt; And if I move between\n\n318\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.980\nthese two firewalls outside my corporate\nnetwork, what do we call this little area?\n\n319\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.020\n&gt;&gt; You can call that a bastion host.\n\n320\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.490\nWell, usually a bastion host,\nsorry about that, is gonna be your decoy.\n\n321\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.740\nBut that would be your demilitarized zone\nor screen to subnet someone might save.\n\n322\n00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n323\n00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:57.554\nAnd so, that's why we would put resources\nthat need to be accessed by the public,\n\n324\n00:15:57.554 --> 00:16:00.139\nkeep us separate from\nour internal network.\n\n325\n00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:03.340\nWell that means the server that's\ndoing all of this authentication and\n\n326\n00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.967\nconnecting back here to my authentication\nserver is sitting out where the public\n\n327\n00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.570\nhas access to it, right?\n\n328\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.560\nThat can be a little iffy there.\n\n329\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.730\nIf I need to set up more than one,\nwhat if this guy can't accept\n\n330\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.280\nall of the inbound connections,\nI set up a second one?\n\n331\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.140\nThat's a second copy of the policies.\n\n332\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.550\nIf I change policies in one place,\nit doesn't change them in the other place.\n\n333\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.480\nAs I get five, or six, or seven remote\naccess servers, it becomes a nightmare.\n\n334\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.240\nThat's where the RADIUS server comes in.\n\n335\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.140\nWe are going to move\nthe authentication process\n\n336\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.810\ninside my trusted portion on my network.\n\n337\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.340\nNow the remote access server\nbecomes my RADIUS client, and\n\n338\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.590\nthen I have my RADIUS server.\n\n339\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.362\nAnd the authentication request or\n\n340\n00:16:44.362 --> 00:16:47.666\nthe remote access request comes\ninto the remote access server.\n\n341\n00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:51.383\nThe remote access server says, okay thank\nyou for providing me this information,\n\n342\n00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:54.010\nI'm just gonna send it\non to the RADIUS server.\n\n343\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.630\nAll right, the radius server then is gonna\ncheck with your authentication server and\n\n344\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:03.580\nvalidate your credentials, check policies,\nand tell the remote access server,\n\n345\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.260\nthe RADIUS client whether or\nnot to allow that connection.\n\n346\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.790\nSo we're moving everything back inside\nour network, which is supposedly,\n\n347\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.220\nshould be a more secure\nportion of our network.\n\n348\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.484\n&gt;&gt; And there you go, you're adding your\nlayers, your defense and depth, and\n\n349\n00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:20.860\nmaking things a little more complicated,\nextra hoops to go through, right?\n\n350\n00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:26.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI can add multiple remote access servers,\n\n351\n00:17:26.041 --> 00:17:32.270\nand those would just be pointed\nback to that same RADIUS server.\n\n352\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.094\nRight, if I can do this quick enough for\nour show here,\n\n353\n00:17:36.094 --> 00:17:38.353\nwe can just kind of do like that.\n\n354\n00:17:38.353 --> 00:17:39.264\nTie that all together like that right?\n\n355\n00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:41.440\n&gt;&gt; Wow yeah [LAUGH].\n\n356\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.633\n&gt;&gt; Or what about this, let's get\nrid of that guy all together, and\n\n357\n00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:47.372\nlet's see if I've got one\nin my little diagrams here.\n\n358\n00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:48.848\nWe all know wireless access and\n\n359\n00:17:48.848 --> 00:17:51.810\nthe wonderful authentication\nmethods they have available.\n\n360\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.120\nWell, a wireless access point\ncan be a RADIUS client.\n\n361\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.220\nSo I can take the authentication off\nof the wireless access point and\n\n362\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.560\nmove it back here to the RADIUS server.\n\n363\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.195\nThey can get into the wireless\naccess point great,\n\n364\n00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:05.452\nyou ain't getting past there because\nyou've gotta go through this.\n\n365\n00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:06.196\n&gt;&gt; To authenticate.\n\n366\n00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:07.570\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, exactly.\n\n367\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.910\nSo that's the idea behind RADIUS,\n\n368\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.490\nRADIUS is Remote Authentication\nDial In User Service.\n\n369\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.370\nWe're gonna move the authentication\nprocess back into the secure portion of my\n\n370\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.370\nnetwork, where I've got\na little tighter security,\n\n371\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.670\nhopefully a little less\nrisk involved there.\n\n372\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.018\n&gt;&gt; And if you are talking about wireless,\n\n373\n00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:28.087\nremember that's gonna be\nWPA2 Enterprise right with the RADIUS.\n\n374\n00:18:28.087 --> 00:18:31.222\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] WEP if it's all you got, but-\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n375\n00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:34.126\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you got a newer\naccess point than that.\n\n376\n00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:40.041\nAll right so, we talked about\nBiometrics Tokens, Single Sign-On RADIUS,\n\n377\n00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:45.060\nnext on our list of topics is\ncritical security controls.\n\n378\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.080\nAll right, so critical security controls,\nwhen we talk about,\n\n379\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:57.620\nwe know a control is something we put\nin place to help deal with risk, right.\n\n380\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.628\nThere is a risk of somebody coming into\nmy building in the middle of the night\n\n381\n00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:01.890\ntaking my computers.\n\n382\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:07.011\nWe put a lock on the door,\nthat's a type of physical control,\n\n383\n00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:12.229\na camera, a guard, but\nwe have technical controls which would\n\n384\n00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:17.193\nbe software, I don't know,\n\n385\n00:19:17.193 --> 00:19:21.612\nrequiring you to authenticate, for\nexample, or encryption would be a kind\n\n386\n00:19:21.612 --> 00:19:25.559\nof we're controlling access so\nthat would be a technical control.\n\n387\n00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:29.201\nIt could be hardware,\nit could be software based,\n\n388\n00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:32.178\nfirewalls would be technical controls.\n\n389\n00:19:32.178 --> 00:19:34.490\nAnd then you've got\nadministrative controls.\n\n390\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.975\nWhich are policies,\nprocedures that we write,\n\n391\n00:19:37.975 --> 00:19:41.551\nthat we develop that\nare another type of control.\n\n392\n00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:46.291\nWhen they talk about the critical security\ncontrols, there's an organization,\n\n393\n00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.850\nthe Center for Internet Security.\n\n394\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:53.770\nAnd they publish what's known as the CIS,\nCenter for Internet Security CSC,\n\n395\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.890\nthe Critical Security Controls, and\n\n396\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.970\nthey have their top 20\nCritical Security Controls.\n\n397\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:04.320\nAnd these controls are what\nthey consider baseline,\n\n398\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.490\nthis is what you need to do in a network\nto help keep it secure at a minimum.\n\n399\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.370\nThere are many,\nmany controls we can put in place, but\n\n400\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.320\nthe Critical Security Controls are the\nones that are outlined by the Center for\n\n401\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.390\nInternet Security.\n\n402\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.930\nAnd let's go take a look at\ntheir web page real quick.\n\n403\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.010\nAgain this is the Center for\nInternet Security.\n\n404\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.170\nI've gone to their CIS Controls and\nit gives you a little breakdown,\n\n405\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.180\na prioritized set of cyber practices.\n\n406\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.867\nInteresting information they put here,\norganizations that\n\n407\n00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:40.001\napply just the first 5 controls,\njust the first 5 out of the 20,\n\n408\n00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:43.805\ncan reduce their cyber\nattack surface by 85%.\n\n409\n00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:48.918\nImplementing all 20 controls can\nreduce your risk by about 94%.\n\n410\n00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:51.790\nNow this is again, this is according\nto their research, what they've done.\n\n411\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.330\nNumbers might not be exact.\n\n412\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.035\nI like to say 94%-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:57.583\n&gt;&gt; That does seem pretty specific,\n\n414\n00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:01.398\nbut I'm sure they've got the research to\nback these numbers up cuz they do this for\n\n415\n00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:02.462\nhere, in the states.\n\n416\n00:21:05.008 --> 00:21:09.380\nThey're recommended by\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n417\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:14.089\nYou can see down below that the National\nGovernor's Association recommends\n\n418\n00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:17.990\nit's states do this to give\nthem that baseline security.\n\n419\n00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:23.080\nSo let's look, here's the top five\ncontrols, and you can see it's things like\n\n420\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.170\nCSC 1: inventory of authorized and\nunauthorized devices.\n\n421\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.000\nAnd you might think, wow,\nhow is that gonna help my security, right?\n\n422\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.720\nBut this is the first thing they put on\nthe list, is knowing what you have, so\n\n423\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.820\nthat you can know what shouldn't be there.\n\n424\n00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.440\nIf we expand this out, actively manage\ninventory track, correct all hardware\n\n425\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.340\ndevices on the network, that only\nauthorized devices are given access.\n\n426\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.780\nUnauthorized and\nunmanaged devices are found and\n\n427\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.680\nprevented from gaining access, all right.\n\n428\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.600\nSo they're saying we need\nto make sure we have a way\n\n429\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.900\nof detecting what devices are out there.\n\n430\n00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.150\nWe need to know what should be there so\nthat we can block what shouldn't be there.\n\n431\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.790\nAnd they'll go on to tell you,\nwell how do I do this?\n\n432\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.740\nOkay, this sounds great,\nwell we want to do it, what do I do?\n\n433\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.090\nDeploy an automated asset\ninventory discovery tool.\n\n434\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.540\nIf an organization is dynamically\nassigning IP addresses using DHCP,\n\n435\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.810\nyou can make sure you're doing DHCP\nlogging to find assets that are picking up\n\n436\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.250\nIP addresses that shouldn't be there,\nunauthorized devices.\n\n437\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.180\nEnsure that all equipment acquisitions\nautomatically update your inventory.\n\n438\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:27.830\nSomebody goes out and\n\n439\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.660\nbuys five new laptops,\ndoes that get added to my inventory?\n\n440\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.580\nWhen I see them in logs, or my automated\ndiscovery finds them, I'm gonna know they\n\n441\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.290\nshould be there, or are they gonna\nlook like unauthorized devices?\n\n442\n00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.220\nMaintain, and\nI'm not gonna read all this to you,\n\n443\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.350\nthis is something you guys can do when\nyou're trying to fall asleep at night.\n\n444\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.577\nAnd they go on number 2, the Inventory\nof Authorized and Unauthorized software.\n\n445\n00:22:51.577 --> 00:22:55.122\n3, Secure Configurations for\nHardware and Software.\n\n446\n00:22:55.122 --> 00:22:58.310\nNumber 4,\nContinuous Vulnerability Assessment.\n\n447\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.000\nSo basically we're saying, right, if we\nstop, did they say the top four, right?\n\n448\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.820\n&gt;&gt; Top five.\n\n449\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.092\n&gt;&gt; They say all five of those?\n\n450\n00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:05.763\nYeah.\n\n451\n00:23:05.763 --> 00:23:06.275\n&gt;&gt; That's what you said.\n\n452\n00:23:06.275 --> 00:23:07.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I said, I know.\n\n453\n00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:09.424\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even remember what I said\n\n454\n00:23:09.424 --> 00:23:10.490\nfive minutes ago.\n\n455\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.740\nNumber 5 Controlled Use of\nAdministrative Privileges.\n\n456\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.725\nSo if I implement just these,\nI can reduce my risk.\n\n457\n00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:19.409\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty oustanding, what was it?\n\n458\n00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:21.043\nSee, I don't remember now the percent,\nwas it 88?\n\n459\n00:23:21.043 --> 00:23:22.370\n&gt;&gt; 85%, right.\n\n460\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.242\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n461\n00:23:23.242 --> 00:23:24.920\n&gt;&gt; Just by implementing those.\n\n462\n00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.540\nAnd what we do, we might not be able\nimplement them all at once, but\n\n463\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.480\nwe can start with number 1 and kinda\nwork our way all the way down as we go.\n\n464\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.120\nWe might find that some of them\nare not necessary in our environment.\n\n465\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:42.240\nIt depends on what regulations you need to\nfollow, as well as wanting to be secure.\n\n466\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.890\nBut this is their top 5,\nand you can go out, and\n\n467\n00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.370\nyou can download the top 20 or\ntheir 20 Critical Security Controls.\n\n468\n00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.055\nI have a sheet somewhere,\nhere it is, where you can go.\n\n469\n00:23:54.055 --> 00:23:59.148\nAnd see this is Version 6.0,\nthey're actually on Version 6.1 now.\n\n470\n00:23:59.148 --> 00:24:03.150\nBut the same information,\njust in a spreadsheet, critical control 3.\n\n471\n00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.915\nSecure configuration of hardware and\nsoftware, what to do about it,\n\n472\n00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:10.600\nhow to implement those controls.\n\n473\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.820\nSo on this exam,\n\n474\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.640\nthey're not asking you to memorize the top\n20 critical security controls from CIS.\n\n475\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.623\nBut what we do need to understand is kind\nof what I've been explaining to you,\n\n476\n00:24:22.623 --> 00:24:27.530\nwhat they are, why would be concerned\nwith them because these are ways that I\n\n477\n00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.920\ncan reduce risks in my environment.\n\n478\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.320\nThey're proven as to how we go\nabout implementing controls.\n\n479\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.780\nI will give you a breakdown\non kind of the steps.\n\n480\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.030\nWhen we talk about critical\nsecurity controls,\n\n481\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.290\nwe do need to have a plan, right?\n\n482\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.900\nI'm not just gonna go I think\nI'm gonna go buy a camera and\n\n483\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.060\nstick it up over the front door and\ncall it a day.\n\n484\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.250\nOr we decide that, hey,\n\n485\n00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.200\nwe're gonna do encryption on\nall of the patient information.\n\n486\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.029\nDone, call it a day.\n\n487\n00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:57.199\nIt's definitely not as easy as that.\n\n488\n00:24:57.199 --> 00:24:59.410\nThere is a procedure to it.\n\n489\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.739\nI wanna make sure we go over that.\n\n490\n00:25:00.739 --> 00:25:02.530\nWhen we talk about the steps.\n\n491\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.180\nYou're going to plan for\ncontrol management.\n\n492\n00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.313\nWe've gotta understand that,\nlike I just said, it's not set it and\n\n493\n00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:09.350\nforget it type thing.\n\n494\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.950\nYou're going to have to\nhave control management.\n\n495\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:12.646\nSomebody to,\n\n496\n00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:16.362\nor a group people that's gonna administer\nthe control we've put in place.\n\n497\n00:25:16.362 --> 00:25:17.810\n&gt;&gt; Stay on top of things, yeah.\n\n498\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.828\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nTalk about you're gonna develop your\n\n499\n00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:23.142\ncontrol deployment strategy.\n\n500\n00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:26.790\nYou're going to figure out\nwhat controls you even need,\n\n501\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.220\nwhich ones do I need to\nimplement in our environment.\n\n502\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.700\nYou gotta have a control analysis process.\n\n503\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.700\nWhat does it?\nDoes it do what it says it does?\n\n504\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.130\nIs it controlling it\nthe way we expected it to?\n\n505\n00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.620\nDid we implement it properly?\n\n506\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.760\nAnd then assess it afterwards,\nis it working, right?\n\n507\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.045\nDid we do it correctly?\n\n508\n00:25:48.045 --> 00:25:53.400\nYou're gonna define the controls again\npicking which controls you want.\n\n509\n00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.800\nAnalyze the controls and then assess\nthe controls and it's a repeating process.\n\n510\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.592\nIt's over and over,\nyou're constantly assessing things change.\n\n511\n00:26:04.592 --> 00:26:07.662\nI have this silly little\nexample I almost always use.\n\n512\n00:26:07.662 --> 00:26:09.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For this kind of thing.\n\n513\n00:26:09.038 --> 00:26:09.891\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared.\n\n514\n00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:11.027\n&gt;&gt; I know, right.\n\n515\n00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:17.730\nSo you go and you put cameras outside over\neach doorway, which is a great thing.\n\n516\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.070\nOne it acts as a deterrent.\n\n517\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.018\nBecause people see the camera and\ngo, I can't go up there and\n\n518\n00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:23.140\ntry to jimmie the lock.\n\n519\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.640\nI'm gonna be on film the whole time,\nright?\n\n520\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.228\nSo it was a great deterrent, plus it's\na record cuz we can record that stuff.\n\n521\n00:26:29.228 --> 00:26:32.252\n&gt;&gt; You know something that I just learned\nabout the other day that I thought was\n\n522\n00:26:32.252 --> 00:26:32.830\npretty cool.\n\n523\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.382\nI think it's called ring.com,\nI hope so anyways,\n\n524\n00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:37.819\nI'm not sending you guys out there for\nno reason.\n\n525\n00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:39.519\nBut it's-\n&gt;&gt; I know it.\n\n526\n00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:43.950\n&gt;&gt; A doorbell with a camera,\na screen interface there.\n\n527\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.092\nSo even if you're not at home, and\nyou're on a mobile device or something,\n\n528\n00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:50.308\nyou can still answer it and even kind of.\n\n529\n00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:53.858\nEven if you wanted to show if\nyou're at work, and show your desk,\n\n530\n00:26:53.858 --> 00:26:58.050\nyour delivery person or whomever\nmight not know that you're at work.\n\n531\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.640\nThey just, you could say hey I\ncan't come to the door right now,\n\n532\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.860\nleave the package or whatever.\n\n533\n00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.170\nBut really you're not even at home.\n\n534\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.382\nYeah, its pretty neat, isn't it?\n\n535\n00:27:04.382 --> 00:27:05.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n536\n00:27:05.108 --> 00:27:06.550\n&gt;&gt; It's something that's definitely\n\n537\n00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.390\nworth looking into.\n\n538\n00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.187\nI thought it was pretty cool.\n\n539\n00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:11.910\nWhere was I with that?\n\n540\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.824\nSo we talked about the,\nmy story about the cameras, yeah, so.\n\n541\n00:27:14.824 --> 00:27:16.085\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna try to jimmy the door.\n\n542\n00:27:16.085 --> 00:27:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you put these cameras in\nplace, and you think great I'm done.\n\n543\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.922\nThe problem is big windstorm,\na squirrel, who knows what?\n\n544\n00:27:22.922 --> 00:27:27.165\nAnd all of a sudden that camera that was\npointed at the door Is now pointed at\n\n545\n00:27:27.165 --> 00:27:27.790\nthe wall.\n\n546\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.380\nAnd so, you have a break in,\nyou go to review your tape, and\n\n547\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.140\nyou've got this great close-up of brick,\nand\n\n548\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.080\nevery once in a while you see\na little bug go by or something.\n\n549\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.359\nBut my point is, without testing, without\nperiodically reviewing these controls.\n\n550\n00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:46.014\nAnd like I said that's\na simple silly example.\n\n551\n00:27:46.014 --> 00:27:47.360\nBut that's-\n&gt;&gt; It works.\n\n552\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.894\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea.\n\n553\n00:27:47.894 --> 00:27:52.380\nIs I have to make sure that there still\ndoing what I expected them to do.\n\n554\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.063\nIts not a set it and forget it type thing.\n\n555\n00:27:55.063 --> 00:27:56.560\nAll right I know we're\nrunning short on time.\n\n556\n00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.511\nSo I'll wrap this guy up with\nSIEM are system information and\n\n557\n00:28:01.511 --> 00:28:03.852\nevent management systems.\n\n558\n00:28:03.852 --> 00:28:06.250\nThis is the big thing right now.\n\n559\n00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.270\nEverybody's talking about SIEMs, and\n\n560\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.550\nit's because of the big data\nthat we're now dealing with.\n\n561\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:18.356\nWe have more and more information coming\nin to us from different devices right.\n\n562\n00:28:18.356 --> 00:28:21.968\nYears ago we had some log\nfiles from the firewall and\n\n563\n00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:25.050\na few other sources of information.\n\n564\n00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.250\nNow we've got network intrusion detection\nand prevention systems, just giving us\n\n565\n00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.400\nall kinds of information about\nthe traffic that's going on our network.\n\n566\n00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.210\nWe've got logs from all of our\ndifferent servers, our firewalls.\n\n567\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.840\nOur routers, possibly our switches,\nour operating systems,\n\n568\n00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.420\nlike in our servers, and on our clients.\n\n569\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.350\nIt's just a huge amount of data.\n\n570\n00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:48.090\nIt's way too much to sift\nthrough manually typically.\n\n571\n00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.090\nAnd that's where these SIEM\nsystems come into play.\n\n572\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.083\nIt's a way to centralize\nall that information,\n\n573\n00:28:53.083 --> 00:28:55.347\nmake sense out of it, correlate it.\n\n574\n00:28:55.347 --> 00:28:59.789\nYou know, if I'm looking at a breach and\nI've got my firewall log and\n\n575\n00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:04.307\nI've got my server that got breached log,\nI need the times to line up so\n\n576\n00:29:04.307 --> 00:29:08.090\nI can see this attack as it\nprogressed through my network.\n\n577\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.080\nWe've got those IDS systems that\nare just flooding us with information.\n\n578\n00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.870\nI need some way to get all that and\nbe able to filter it and\n\n579\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:22.660\nlook for signs of attack not just\nnormal emails going back and forth and\n\n580\n00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.300\nagain that's where the seam\nsystems come into play.\n\n581\n00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.550\nThere are pay versions\nthere are free versions.\n\n582\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.180\nYou look at something like\nAlien Vault fantastic.\n\n583\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.970\nSeam system that's just one,\nwhat's a free one,\n\n584\n00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.380\nSSIM is another one that's\nan open source one.\n\n585\n00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.640\nSo, it gives me that log management, it\ngives me the ability to filter, aggregate,\n\n586\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.070\nwhat we call normalize the data.\n\n587\n00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.740\nPut it in some format that's useful,\nor that we can use.\n\n588\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.329\nAnd you've also gotta consider the scope.\n\n589\n00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:57.387\nI might have,\n\n590\n00:29:57.387 --> 00:30:02.870\nI don't know logs from devices that\nare really not as important, right?\n\n591\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.750\nMy sensitive systems\nare much more important than\n\n592\n00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.480\nmaybe one of my end users laptop,\nalthough it's a tough call.\n\n593\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.134\nThat laptop could be the source of\nthe attack that was the beginning of\n\n594\n00:30:13.134 --> 00:30:15.442\nan infection, because they\nclicked on some link in email.\n\n595\n00:30:15.442 --> 00:30:20.337\nBut do understand that you can prioritize,\ndecide what assets or\n\n596\n00:30:20.337 --> 00:30:22.122\nnetworks are In scope.\n\n597\n00:30:22.122 --> 00:30:25.705\nMaybe you're doing this because\nof regulatory requirements.\n\n598\n00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:29.458\nThere are some resources that maybe\nyou don't need to monitor as closely\n\n599\n00:30:29.458 --> 00:30:30.930\nas others.\n\n600\n00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.560\nSo we can make those decisions.\n\n601\n00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.080\nWe've gotta review our\nlogs in a timely fashion.\n\n602\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.740\nFind those EOIs, or events of interest, is\nreally what we're typically looking for.\n\n603\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.820\nThese seam systems also\ngive us an audit trail.\n\n604\n00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.890\nThat's another big, big part of it.\n\n605\n00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.662\nBecause when we have to comply\nwith regulatory regulations.\n\n606\n00:30:52.662 --> 00:30:54.294\n&gt;&gt; Bodies.\n\n607\n00:30:54.294 --> 00:30:55.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, body there you go.\n\n608\n00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:01.464\nSo when you have to deal with governmental\nor industry regulation, seam systems\n\n609\n00:31:01.464 --> 00:31:07.076\ncan help me, keeping those log files for\nhowever long the regulation specifies.\n\n610\n00:31:07.076 --> 00:31:08.820\n&gt;&gt; For data retention.\n\n611\n00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and when it comes time to audit,\nyou got those auditors coming in,\n\n612\n00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.612\nI need to be able to pull all\nof that out and show them.\n\n613\n00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:19.745\nSo it can definitely help in those\nrespects, and just in general.\n\n614\n00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:24.104\nSeam systems allow me to work with the big\ndata that we're seeing now from all of\n\n615\n00:31:24.104 --> 00:31:27.488\nthese different devices and\nsensors we have on our network.\n\n616\n00:31:27.488 --> 00:31:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Mike.\n\n617\n00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.176\nWe've actually made it to a part three.\n\n618\n00:31:30.176 --> 00:31:31.540\nAnd I think that's about everything.\n\n619\n00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.270\nWe've covered several different\naccess control methods.\n\n620\n00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.970\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n621\n00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.080\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more of GIAC headed your way.\n\n622\n00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.457\nFor this show we we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n623\n00:31:40.457 --> 00:31:41.350\nI am Cherokee Boose.\n\n624\n00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.204\n&gt;&gt; And I am Mike Rodrick.\n\n625\n00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:45.720\n&gt;&gt; See you next time at ITPRO.TV.\n\n626\n00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n627\n00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.902\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.219\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.890\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.440\nAnd in today's episode we are back\n\n8\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.780\nwith more of our\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.360\nAnd joining me in the studio today,\n\n10\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.190\na man who likes to take risks,\nthat's our good friend, Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.090\nMike, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.770\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.540\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.540\nThanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.070\nAnd, yeah, we're gonna take some risks.\n\n16\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.500\nWell, we're gonna be talking\nabout risk management.\n\n17\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.600\nAt least, that's what's in store for\nus for this particular episode.\n\n18\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.650\nNow, we've got to be familiar with some of\nthe basic concepts of risk management, and\n\n19\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.160\nwe've got to make sure we\nhave our terminology down,\n\n20\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160\ncouple of formulas that we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n21\n00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.250\nThat's a big part of being in cyber\nsecurity, is understanding risk.\n\n22\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.820\nAnd we talk about doing\nrisk analysis all the time.\n\n23\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.110\nSo, risk management,\nit is an important concept for us.\n\n24\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.960\nSo, let's start with\njust some basic concept.\n\n25\n00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.590\nWe've mentioned the term defense and\ndepth before, right?\n\n26\n00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.100\nAnd it really comes from a military,\nI don't know if you'd call it a procedure-\n\n27\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.840\n&gt;&gt; History-\n\n28\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Concept, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.220\nDefense and depth was basically\nhaving multiple lines of defense.\n\n30\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360\nAnd the idea was you're gonna\nslow the enemy down until you\n\n31\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.330\ncan attack them, right?\n\n32\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.530\nAs they work their way through your\nlines of defense, they get slowed down.\n\n33\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.380\nWe take out a few of their numbers until\nwe have a chance to get everything ready\n\n34\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.610\nand attack.\n\n35\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.622\nSo it's not quite the same when it\ncomes to security, in cyber security,\n\n36\n00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:40.290\nbut similar.\n\n37\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.510\nSome people argue that defense in\ndepth is not a great solution.\n\n38\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.800\nBut I think most are concluding\nin GAIC it's something that we do\n\n39\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.980\ntry to implement.\n\n40\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.527\nAnd I think it's a good thing because\nwe've talked about it before, right?\n\n41\n00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:56.650\nWe've talked about defense in depth.\n\n42\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.090\nWe're talking about layers of security.\n\n43\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.340\nWe're not planning to attack, and\n\n44\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.060\nthat's where some people\nsay the model breaks down.\n\n45\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.630\n&gt;&gt; It's an interesting conversation\nbecause you've got the people that say\n\n46\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590\nyou create wall after wall after wall for\nthe attacker to have to get through.\n\n47\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.820\nAnd therefore, slows them down, eventually\nhopefully staving them off completely.\n\n48\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.260\nWe got the people that say,\njust build stronger walls and\n\n49\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.920\nyou don't have to build as many.\n\n50\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.010\nSo it's definitely a philosophical\nconversation, but the common,\n\n51\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.550\nI think, and Mike would agree with me,\n\n52\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.345\nmost common practitioners say\ndefense in depth is the way to go.\n\n53\n00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:29.983\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n54\n00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:34.645\nEven though we're not planning to launch\nan attack at some point, each one of those\n\n55\n00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:38.374\nlayers that they have to go through\nin order to get to their target is\n\n56\n00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:43.115\na chance for me to detect the attack and\npossibly stop the attack in its tracks.\n\n57\n00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.205\nAnd that's gotta be a good thing, right?\n\n58\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:48.355\nSo defense in depth is something\nthat we do try to implement.\n\n59\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:49.885\nAnd we do have to think about it.\n\n60\n00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:52.320\nPhysical type controls here.\n\n61\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.130\nWe're talking about fences, walls, guards,\n\n62\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.500\ndogs things of that nature\nprevent physical access to,\n\n63\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.876\neither your facilities or\nit could be physical access to systems.\n\n64\n00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:07.835\nWe could have a server closet that has\na separate lock than the door to the front\n\n65\n00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:11.805\noffice, and only certain people are\nallowed access into the server closet so\n\n66\n00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:15.125\nthey can't touch, they can't physically\ntouch those machines in there.\n\n67\n00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.535\nCuz we all know the good old\nten immutable laws of security,\n\n68\n00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:22.190\none of them being if I can touch your\nmachine, it's no longer your machine.\n\n69\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.860\nSo, physical security.\n\n70\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.830\nWe also have technical controls\nthat we'll put in place.\n\n71\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.550\nTechnical controls can be hardware, they\ncan be software, they could be things like\n\n72\n00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.880\nfirewalls or could be software\nlike intrusion detection, or\n\n73\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.650\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n74\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.830\nJust keep in mind where\nit's like physical controls\n\n75\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.780\nkeep me from accessing the system itself.\n\n76\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.530\nThe technical controls keep me from\naccessing the information that's\n\n77\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.410\non the systems.\n\n78\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.250\nThey're not going to do anything to stop\nme from accessing the systems, right?\n\n79\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.590\nAnd then you've got administrative\ncontrols which are going to be\n\n80\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.610\npolicies and procedures that we define.\n\n81\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.470\nA very important part of\nour defense in depth.\n\n82\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.580\nWithout good policies and\nunderstanding what we need to secure,\n\n83\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.170\nhow we plan on going about securing it,\nwhat happens in the case of an incident.\n\n84\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.960\nThe number of policies we have goes on and\non and on.\n\n85\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.200\nBut policies are a big part\nof our defense in-depth.\n\n86\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.090\nIt is one of those layers, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.570\nNow, when it comes to vulnerabilities,\n\n88\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.470\nrisk management,\nwe have to understand the concept\n\n89\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.210\nof vulnerabilities because that's what\nrisk management is all about, right?\n\n90\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.010\nWhen we talk about risk management,\nwe're looking at vulnerabilities.\n\n91\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.380\nWe're trying to decide what threats could\ntake advantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n92\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.500\nAnd then what our exposure would be,\nwhat the impact would be\n\n93\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.680\nof said threat taking advantage\nof one of those vulnerabilities.\n\n94\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.470\nIf we don't know what vulnerabilities\nwe have, we can't do risk management.\n\n95\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.760\nSo, we've done this on other episodes,\nwe've talked about vulnerability scanning.\n\n96\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.240\nWe have many, many automated\ntools that can help us do this.\n\n97\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.820\nAs far as computer systems go,\nwe can scan them.\n\n98\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.260\nWe have databases of\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n99\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.710\nWe can look at that,\nthose reports that we get back.\n\n100\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.540\nBut it goes beyond that, right?\n\n101\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.660\nWe have to think about things beyond\nour computer systems when it comes\n\n102\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.310\nto risk management like, hey,\nwe live in Florida, Daniel,\n\n103\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.470\ncan you think of any natural type risks we\nmight face, vulnerabilities we might have?\n\n104\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.860\n&gt;&gt; Man, just off the top of my head,\n\n105\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.326\nwe get these weird storms\nabout the middle of the year.\n\n106\n00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.772\nThey're pretty violent.\n\n107\n00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:30.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, hurricanes.\n\n108\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.700\nNatural disasters are a vulnerability.\n\n109\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.150\nOur building is vulnerable\nto high winds or hurricanes.\n\n110\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.960\nThis is something that I've got to think\nabout when I'm doing my risk management.\n\n111\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.941\nIt's gonna go on my list just like\nweak passwords or unpatched software.\n\n112\n00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:52.340\nWe're gonna have [COUGH] excuse me,\nnatural type vulnerabilities.\n\n113\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.720\nWe have man made risks that we\nmight have to deal with that could,\n\n114\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.780\nagain, impact our business and\nour ability to do business, all right?\n\n115\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.700\nSo having a good understanding\nof what vulnerabilities are,\n\n116\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.290\nhaving the tools necessary, brain\nstorming, thinking about all the different\n\n117\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.630\nthings that our assets,\nwhat risks our asset face, and\n\n118\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.140\nthen trying to figure out how we're\ngonna deal with said risks, all right?\n\n119\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.530\nContingency planning.\n\n120\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.410\nThis is kind of a big term that really\ninvolves a lot of littler things,\n\n121\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.320\nif that makes sense, right?\n\n122\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's an umbrella term.\n\n123\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.390\nWe talk about contingency planning,\nit's not one thing,\n\n124\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.580\nthere's a lot of elements that\nmake up our contingency planning.\n\n125\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.800\nThe big ones that we wanna talk about\nthat they specifically call out\n\n126\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.910\non the objectives for GIACG SEC are gonna\nbe business continuity planning,\n\n127\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.620\ndisaster recovery planning, and\nbusiness impact analysis, all right?\n\n128\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.370\nAnd how that relates to risk management.\n\n129\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.480\nBusiness continuity planning is a lot of\ntimes one of our upper level policies.\n\n130\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.250\nAnd it's usually supported by several\nother policies in our organization.\n\n131\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.530\nBut I really wanna stress\nthe difference here between\n\n132\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.450\nbusiness continuity planning and disaster\nrecovery planning, cuz I think that's\n\n133\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.460\nwhere people get confused sometimes is,\nwait, aren't those the same thing?\n\n134\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.660\nAnd they're not.\n\n135\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.090\nThey're close, but the disaster\nrecovery plan is actually part of,\n\n136\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.140\nor a subset of,\nyour business continuity plan, all right?\n\n137\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.515\nBusiness continuity plans\nare how am I going to continue\n\n138\n00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:32.815\nto operate even though something has\nfailed, or something has gone wrong?\n\n139\n00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:36.835\nHow do I continue to operate\nat least as best as I can?\n\n140\n00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:38.565\nWe don't wanna just stop.\n\n141\n00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:40.895\nWe can't just stop,\nwe have to continue to make money,\n\n142\n00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:43.435\nwe have to continue to\noperate as a business.\n\n143\n00:07:43.435 --> 00:07:48.420\nSo business continuity plans are, okay, if\nthis happens, this is what we're gonna do,\n\n144\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.760\nwe're going to,\ntrying to think of an example.\n\n145\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.830\nWe might rent systems that we can use.\n\n146\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.078\nWe might have other\nfacilities that we can use.\n\n147\n00:07:57.078 --> 00:08:02.070\nWe have alternate ISPs or service\nproviders that we can take advantage of.\n\n148\n00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.687\nWe're gonna be able to Switch to\nanother location and continue to work.\n\n149\n00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:11.340\nThe disaster recovery plan is how\ndo I get things back to normal?\n\n150\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.920\nHow do I recover after a disaster,\nall right?\n\n151\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.590\nSo you see the difference?\n\n152\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.430\nWhen a disaster occurs,\nboth plans are really gonna kick in.\n\n153\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.850\nThe disaster recovery plan is gonna try\nto get us back to normal operating speed.\n\n154\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.910\nBut in the meantime,\n\n155\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.360\nwhile that plan is being put into place,\nwe have to continue on.\n\n156\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.160\nWe want to continue business, so\n\n157\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.690\nthat's where the business\ncontinuity plan can help us.\n\n158\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.230\nWhat can we do so that I don't have\nsales people just sitting around\n\n159\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.220\nwith no computers, no phones,\nnot doing anything, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.005\nI can't have that,\n\n161\n00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:44.905\nI've gotta have some way that we can\nkinda keep going if possible, right?\n\n162\n00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:48.005\nI mean, it always depends on\nthe disaster that has occurred.\n\n163\n00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.295\nAnd that's the other thing, too.\n\n164\n00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:52.755\nBusiness continuity might not\ninvolve a disaster, right?\n\n165\n00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.930\nWe can have Foreseeable incidents.\n\n166\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.790\nDisasters really mean unforeseen, I don't\nwant to say unforeseeable cuz that's not\n\n167\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.960\ntrue but\ndisasters are usually catastrophic, right?\n\n168\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.320\nThe building has burned down, or\n\n169\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.550\na hurricane has come through and\nleveled things.\n\n170\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.780\nWe got attacked and all of our servers\nhave been wiped, or something like that,\n\n171\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.040\nthat's a disaster.\n\n172\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.260\nIf a hard drive fails in a RAID array\nthat I have, that's not a disaster.\n\n173\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.800\nIt's a problem, and we might have\na business continuity plan in there that\n\n174\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.330\nsays, if this fails we have an alternate\nstorage solution that we have in place.\n\n175\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.510\nIt's not as fast, but\nit'll let us limp along\n\n176\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.480\nuntil we can get our original\nstorage solution back online, right?\n\n177\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.580\nBusiness impact analysis is another\npart of the business continuity plan\n\n178\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.990\nbecause it helps me determine\n\n179\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.370\nthe different business components\nthat we have- what their impact is.\n\n180\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.240\nThis is gonna help,\nwhen we're doing business continuity and\n\n181\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.970\nwe're doing disaster recovery\nwe have to prioritize.\n\n182\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.560\nWe have to decide what is it we need\nto get back online first, for example,\n\n183\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.240\nin my disaster recovery scenario.\n\n184\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.790\nOr even in my business continuity plan,\n\n185\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.970\nwhat is it that we're gonna do first\nthat's gonna allow us to at least,\n\n186\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.670\nlimp along until we can get\neverything back online.\n\n187\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think of, okay, you have your\nweb, say your an online web seller, right?\n\n188\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.600\nPeople go to your website,\nthey can purchase something from you.\n\n189\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.040\nIs email going down more important,\n\n190\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.940\nwhat is the impact against our\nbusiness if email goes down,\n\n191\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.040\nversus whether or not our database is\naccessible through our web portal, right?\n\n192\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.060\nThese are the things that we're talking\nabout when it comes to business impact.\n\n193\n00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.220\nIf my email goes down,\nI'm still selling things online.\n\n194\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.920\nI might not be able to process orders, but\npeople could actually still make an order.\n\n195\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.330\nSo the impact to my business for my email\nserver going down in gonna different\n\n196\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.790\nthan it is if my website went down or\nmy database went down.\n\n197\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.930\n&gt;&gt; And so, and that's exactly right.\n\n198\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.650\nAnd to do the business impact analysis,\n\n199\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.540\nyou have to think about all of the\ndifferent business functions that occur.\n\n200\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.450\nThat means I'm gonna have to\nbring everybody together, and\n\n201\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.300\nwe're gonna break it down, and we're\ngonna look at each one independently and\n\n202\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.970\nwe're gonna decide what's gonna\nhappen if this is unavailable, right?\n\n203\n00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.050\nWe were talking out in the hall earlier,\nand we were talking about\n\n204\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.865\na color printer is unavailable versus\nthe email server's unavailable.\n\n205\n00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:12.350\nKinda like that Daniel was saying.\n\n206\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.970\nOkay, well the business impact of\nthat printer being down means okay,\n\n207\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.090\nwe gotta delay color printing, but and\n\n208\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:25.390\nthe overarching thing in the grander\nscale it's gonna cost me that much.\n\n209\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.050\nUnless my business is\nto print color things.\n\n210\n00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.689\n&gt;&gt; Color things.\n[LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.193\n&gt;&gt; For other people, right?\n\n212\n00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:31.148\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you're a design shop or something.\n\n213\n00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.740\nI have to print this out and\n\n214\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.190\ntake it to the customer like right now.\n\n215\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Then color printing might have\na bigger impact on your business.\n\n216\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.010\nSo that's gonna change things, so it's\nnot the same for every single business.\n\n217\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.490\nBut that's the idea behind\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n218\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.370\nLooking at each business function,\n\n219\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.930\ndetermining what would happen\nif that was unavailable.\n\n220\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:55.440\nAnd for this you can't just, I can't\nas a security professional here for\n\n221\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.840\nmy organization, I can't do this alone\nbecause I don't know all of the business\n\n222\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.940\nfunctions, I don't know\nsome of the things.\n\n223\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.462\nI know what, say, Erin in marketing does\nbut I don't know everything that she uses.\n\n224\n00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:11.220\nWhat if one of the programs\nthat she uses to\n\n225\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.720\nproduce some of the marketing\nmaterial Was unavailable, right?\n\n226\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.580\nThat would have a big impact\non her ability to do her job,\n\n227\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.130\nI might not have thought of that.\n\n228\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.950\nSo this is what I say, we get all our\ndepartments our department heads together,\n\n229\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.990\nmaybe even a couple of\nthe users from the departments.\n\n230\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.240\nUsually your department heads have a good\nidea of what's going on within their\n\n231\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.890\ndepartment but\nthe important thing is to brainstorm this.\n\n232\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this is why\nthe guys in your actuary\n\n233\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.538\ndepartment get paid a lot of money.\n\n234\n00:12:33.538 --> 00:12:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Cuz they do things like this.\n\n235\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then they can think of all this\n\n236\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.090\nstuff and go wow.\n\n237\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.380\nSo again, I want you to think about those\nthree business continuity planning,\n\n238\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.530\nBCP is the acronym for that.\n\n239\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.540\nMake sure you're familiar with that,\nDRP Disaster Recovery Planning.\n\n240\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.220\nWe've got our Business Impact Analysis,\nor BIA,\n\n241\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.900\nwhich is gonna help us again, to figure\nout what business functions are critical.\n\n242\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.300\nAnd allow me to get those back online.\n\n243\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.010\nIt's also gonna help when we talk\nabout doing risk assessment and\n\n244\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.900\ndoing what it is we do in risk management.\n\n245\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.910\nDoing that risk assessment, the BIA will\nhelp us, the Business Impact Analysis.\n\n246\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:15.200\nDid allow us to kinda put\nalmost like a financial or\n\n247\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.890\na dollar amount or\na specific value to something.\n\n248\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.820\nAnd we'll come back to that.\n\n249\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.000\nAll right, next thing I wanna to\ntalk about is policy framework.\n\n250\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.810\nAnd we've mentioned a lot about policies.\n\n251\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.190\nTalked about three specifically,\nthe BCP, the DRP and the BIA.\n\n252\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:35.690\nAnd when it comes to policy framework,\nthere's guidelines that we can use.\n\n253\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.230\nThere's lots of places you go out and\nget templates.\n\n254\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.100\nLike what if your task was writing\na business impact analysis, right?\n\n255\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.230\nOr doing a disaster recovery plan.\n\n256\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.190\nHave you done it before?\n\n257\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.870\nDo you even know what information\nshould be included in there?\n\n258\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.420\nHow do I figure out what\nshould be included in there?\n\n259\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.930\nThere's great places you can go,\nSANS being one of the best in my opinion,\n\n260\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.850\nis to get templates but\n\n261\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.290\nwe can also go to places like governmental\nsources here in the US, NIST, CERT.\n\n262\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.080\nThey all put out templates\nthat we can get.\n\n263\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.320\nAnd they're guidelines, they'd say this is\na basic what we think should be included\n\n264\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.940\nin a disaster recovery plan.\n\n265\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.540\nAnd I can take those and\nI can fluff them up.\n\n266\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.130\nI can fill it in with information\nthat's specific to our organization,\n\n267\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.850\nbut at least it gives\nme that starting point.\n\n268\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.420\nThere are few elements that we\nshould include in our policies.\n\n269\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.170\nIf they're what we consider well written,\nright?\n\n270\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.890\nBecause technically a policy could be you\ntaking out a napkin at a restaurant or\n\n271\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.290\na piece of paper and\njust scribbling some stuff out.\n\n272\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.560\nAnd you could call that your policy.\n\n273\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.780\nBut the problem is that's not gonna\nbe a very efficient policy, and\n\n274\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.160\nit's not gonna be enforceable most likely.\n\n275\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.866\nThen there's gonna be some issues.\n\n276\n00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:47.300\n&gt;&gt; Did you read the napkin Mike?\n\n277\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.430\n[LAUGH] How do you make sure\neveryone gets to see the napkin?\n\n278\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.750\n&gt;&gt; When the auditor comes in and\nsays where is your disaster recovery plan?\n\n279\n00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.418\n&gt;&gt; I believe Bob's wiping his\nface off with it right now.\n\n280\n00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:00.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not gonna look to good for\n\n281\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.770\nyour organization there, yeah you\nmight have some fines after that one.\n\n282\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.440\nAnd so we wanna make sure that\nwe're doing the things properly.\n\n283\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.770\nAgain, so that we can use them, but\nalso that if we have to follow guidelines,\n\n284\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.580\nregulations like HIPAA,\n\n285\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.890\nFISMA, any of these things that\nhave certain requirements.\n\n286\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.170\nPolicies allow us to do that.\n\n287\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.170\nPolicies are how we define\nhow we are going to implement\n\n288\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.660\nwhat is required by those standards,\nright?\n\n289\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.330\nThat says,\nyou have to keep these documents for so\n\n290\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.500\nmany years in this say, in HIPAA.\n\n291\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.610\nAnd so we have a policy that talks\nabout document retention, right?\n\n292\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.750\nAnd anything that has to do with this\nshould be stored here it has to do be kept\n\n293\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.710\nfor this long.\n\n294\n00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.513\nAnd if it's classified as non-personal,\nthen it needs to be stored here,\n\n295\n00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:50.240\nit doesn't have to be encrypted and\nit's only kept for this long, right?\n\n296\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.867\nWe're gonna have a policy\nthat spells that out.\n\n297\n00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.672\nAnd when the auditor comes in to make sure\nwe're compliant with these regulations we\n\n298\n00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:59.510\ncan pull out our policies and we can say,\nthis is what we've got in place.\n\n299\n00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.210\nThis is how we're doing things.\n\n300\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.196\nThat's what they want to see.\n\n301\n00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:04.188\nThey want to see the fact that\nyou've Thought about this,\n\n302\n00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:05.849\nplan it out, put it in writing.\n\n303\n00:16:05.849 --> 00:16:10.759\nIt's still a question of whether\nwe're enforcing it and it's working,\n\n304\n00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:12.960\nbut that's the next step.\n\n305\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.820\nFor now,\nlet's talk about policy framework.\n\n306\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.250\nThe first thing you're gonna\nsee when we talk about\n\n307\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.960\na well written policy is\ngoing to be the introduction.\n\n308\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.700\nBasically a name for your policy.\n\n309\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.450\nHey this is my acceptable use policy.\n\n310\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.230\nAnd an order or\na place in your policy hierarchy.\n\n311\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.050\nAs I said, a lot of times my\nbusiness continuity plan is\n\n312\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.930\none of my over arching documents.\n\n313\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:41.110\nAnd somewhere it's gonna fall underneath\nthat, and I should put in my policy but\n\n314\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.570\nthis is part of that, or where this\nfits in my hierarchy of policies.\n\n315\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.660\nThen we're gonna have a purpose\nto the policy, right?\n\n316\n00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.010\nWe're going to have\na paragraph titled purpose.\n\n317\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.486\nAnd it's gonna say, it's gonna have\nthe main goals, legal compliance,\n\n318\n00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:54.381\nthings like that.\n\n319\n00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:59.067\nWhat is this policy for,\nwhy are we writing this policy?\n\n320\n00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:00.950\nWhat is it supposed to do?\n\n321\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:06.520\nThis policy is to ensure that\nall of my users underscore that\n\n322\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.690\nour company is using strong passwords,\nor controlling access to documents.\n\n323\n00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.570\nIt'll be a little more wordy.\n\n324\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.220\nI'm definitely not the best policy writer,\n\n325\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.400\nit would take me a month\nto word it all out.\n\n326\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.340\n&gt;&gt; But\nit just keeps you from having frivolous\n\n327\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.860\npolicies that don't make any sense.\n\n328\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.720\nThat aren't really serving any purpose.\n\n329\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.430\nYou have to actually put\nthem in a purpose statement.\n\n330\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.310\nSay here's why we're doing it.\n\n331\n00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.220\nWe vetted that out, we understand that\nthis actually will help us in our company.\n\n332\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.490\nThat's why we're doing it.\n\n333\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.654\n&gt;&gt; It helps you write the policy, cuz now\nyou understand what it is that you're\n\n334\n00:17:36.654 --> 00:17:39.133\nsupposed to be defining,\nin these rest of these sections.\n\n335\n00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:40.558\n&gt;&gt; Ever ask somebody why do we\ndo that that way, and they go,\n\n336\n00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:41.646\ncuz that's the way we've always done it.\n\n337\n00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:44.038\nWe're looking to avoid that as an answer.\n\n338\n00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:48.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hopefully, all right,\nthe next thing you're gonna find in\n\n339\n00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:52.414\na well written policy is gonna be scope,\nright.\n\n340\n00:17:52.414 --> 00:17:55.190\nWe have to define who\nthis policy applies to.\n\n341\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.640\nIt might be for\neverybody in the organization.\n\n342\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.210\nOr it might be for\na subset, right, of people.\n\n343\n00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.080\nOr people that have access or\nthe ability to do certain things,\n\n344\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.970\nlike it might be a remote access policy.\n\n345\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.110\nAnd not everybody's allowed remote access.\n\n346\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.832\nSo it's just for\na certain subset of people or [CROSSTALK]\n\n347\n00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:15.012\n&gt;&gt; Always excludes you.\n\n348\n00:18:15.012 --> 00:18:17.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're never in any of these scopes.\n\n349\n00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.810\n&gt;&gt; Above all the policies that I write.\n\n350\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.830\n[LAUGH] But who or\n\n351\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.720\nwhat the policy applies to,\nthis is a security policy for\n\n352\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.040\nour systems that only applies\nto my servers that hold data,\n\n353\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.975\nnot my laptops that my clients use or\nmy users use, when they're travelling.\n\n354\n00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:40.810\nCuz there's not the same types of\ninformation that are stored on it or\n\n355\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.990\nwhat it is used for.\n\n356\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.800\nIt leaves our premise, so\ndifferent policies for that.\n\n357\n00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.250\nBut anyway the scope help us define who or\nwhat the policy is applying to.\n\n358\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.695\nThen you have your roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n359\n00:18:54.695 --> 00:19:00.488\nThere's these policies that are going\nto include how we plan on implementing,\n\n360\n00:19:00.488 --> 00:19:04.556\nwhat we plan on doing,\ndepending on what the policy is.\n\n361\n00:19:04.556 --> 00:19:08.946\nAnd the roles and responsibilities section\nis gonna define who is responsible for\n\n362\n00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:10.172\nactually doing that.\n\n363\n00:19:10.172 --> 00:19:15.880\nIt's all well good to say that, all\nthe data that has to do with a personally\n\n364\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.570\nidentifiable information, if I can slow\ndown and say that, has to be encrypted.\n\n365\n00:19:21.725 --> 00:19:23.985\nOkay, but who has to encrypt it?\n\n366\n00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:26.435\nThe person that accepted the data and\nput in the system.\n\n367\n00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:30.275\nThe system admins, the ITs,\nwho is that responsible for\n\n368\n00:19:30.275 --> 00:19:35.353\nensuring that that information has\nbeen stored properly, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:35.353 --> 00:19:39.585\nSo roles and responsibility so that\nthe people that are reading this policy\n\n370\n00:19:39.585 --> 00:19:42.060\nunderstands, what their responsibility is.\n\n371\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.550\nI want all of this defined and laid out.\n\n372\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.120\nIt's not guesswork,\nthat's why we create these policies.\n\n373\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.700\nWe also need sanctions and violations.\n\n374\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.590\nI'm missing something here.\n\n375\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.770\nWell we'll come back to that.\n\n376\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.539\nSanctions and violations, if our\npolicy is gonna include things like,\n\n377\n00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:02.770\nlet's use a very simple one,\nwe're doing password policy.\n\n378\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.434\nAnd we were gonna have a policy that\nsays your passwords have to be so long,\n\n379\n00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:09.915\nthey have to be changed every so often,\n\n380\n00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:13.323\nthey have to be made up of\ncertain sets of characters.\n\n381\n00:20:13.323 --> 00:20:17.683\nAnd it just reminded me of an interesting\narticle that just came out from Nist,\n\n382\n00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:19.480\ntalking about that very thing.\n\n383\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.410\nBut we'll save that for another show,\ncuz they kinda go against a lot of\n\n384\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.590\nthe things that we've been talking\nabout with password policies.\n\n385\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.880\nBut, anyway, I digress.\n\n386\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.730\nSo, it'll give you something\ngo Google real quick,\n\n387\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.830\nwhen you're done watching this episode.\n\n388\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.200\nBut let's say we've got a simple policy.\n\n389\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:41.340\nIt's stating, this applies to all users in\nour organization that can use our systems.\n\n390\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.760\nAnd we want them to use a long password.\n\n391\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.790\nIt has to be changed every 30 days,\nit has to be strong.\n\n392\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.840\nI guess, where was I going with this?\n\n393\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.690\nYeah, sanctions and violations.\n\n394\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:21:00.060\nIn the policy, we really need to\ndefine what a violation is, how\n\n395\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:05.170\nwe're gonna determine that there's been\na violation like I might have in there.\n\n396\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.650\nMonthly, we are gonna audit passwords and\nwe are going to\n\n397\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.540\nrun them through a password cracker\nthat's using just a dictionary attack and\n\n398\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.070\nsome industry specific terms and\ncommon words.\n\n399\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.480\nAnd if your password is broken\nby this type of simple attack,\n\n400\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.750\nthen you're not following our procedures,\nand that would be a violation.\n\n401\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.970\nThere needs to be sanctions\nin my policies as well.\n\n402\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.990\nWhat happens if somebody\nviolates our policy?\n\n403\n00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.060\nThis is something I stress all the time.\n\n404\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.000\nWithout repercussions,\nthere's no reason for\n\n405\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.390\nsomebody to change their behavior, right.\n\n406\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.745\nAnd that's really what we're trying to\ndo is, we're trying to teach them to be\n\n407\n00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:47.792\nsecure and help, everybody's a part\nof security and I want them to help.\n\n408\n00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:50.364\nAnd if they violate something,\nif I come to Dan and\n\n409\n00:21:50.364 --> 00:21:54.334\nI say look Daniel, you've gotta\nstop using abc123 as your password.\n\n410\n00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:57.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\nno problem, I won't do that anymore.\n\n411\n00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.650\nSo next time we do our audit,\nDaniel's using bcd345, and\n\n412\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.060\nyou know that's not what I meant Daniel,\nwe need to kind of.\n\n413\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.840\n&gt;&gt; But you said Mike.\n\n414\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.850\n&gt;&gt; Your password I said not use ABC123.\n\n415\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.640\n&gt;&gt; I didn't do it.\n\n416\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.880\n&gt;&gt; I didn't do it yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.000\nBut now if there's some kind\nof sanction against Daniel.\n\n418\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.150\nWhere okay if you violate this\npolicy again, we're going to.\n\n419\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.054\nI don't know what can we take away from\n&gt;&gt; Well you would,\n\n420\n00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:24.740\nyou would take away access\nto company resources.\n\n421\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.570\nYou're opening a hole to\nus as a security risk.\n\n422\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.070\nWe've asked you to stop doing that,\nyou won't comply.\n\n423\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.440\nTherefore now, there's a sanction.\n\n424\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.420\nThere's disciplinary action that is\ncoming, because you are exposing us and\n\n425\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.510\nthe risk is going up of\nhaving you as an employee.\n\n426\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.490\nNow you can either change or\nwe can change, what's it gonna be?\n\n427\n00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.576\nThat's what it's going to\nultimately come down to.\n\n428\n00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:46.680\n&gt;&gt; Could be a formal write up.\n\n429\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.961\n&gt;&gt; Yep\n&gt;&gt; That goes into a jacket, and\n\n430\n00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:50.640\nif they get so\nmany it could be the end of their job.\n\n431\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.890\nI mean, obviously one thing you\nreally have to keep in mind,\n\n432\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.870\nthe repercussions have\nto match the violation.\n\n433\n00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.950\n&gt;&gt; The punishment fits\nthe crime kind of thing.\n\n434\n00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n435\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.930\nHey, look, you didn't put\na cover sheet on this report.\n\n436\n00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.631\n&gt;&gt; You're fired.\n&gt;&gt; You're fired.\n\n437\n00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:04.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n438\n00:23:04.665 --> 00:23:06.499\nThat's probably not\nthe way you want to go.\n\n439\n00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.080\nBut the point is you do need something,\nand it needs to be stated in the policy.\n\n440\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.800\nI can't go to Daniel and say, look,\nDaniel, you violated this password policy.\n\n441\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.350\nWe're gonna take away your bonus for\nthis month.\n\n442\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.598\n&gt;&gt; The beatings will continue\nuntil morale improves.\n\n443\n00:23:20.598 --> 00:23:21.106\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:21.106 --> 00:23:22.900\n[LAUGH] And it's like, well,\n\n445\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.600\nwait a second.\n\n446\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.850\nI didn't realize.\n\n447\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.230\nI didn't know that this was.\n\n448\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.340\nAnd there can be issues with human rights.\n\n449\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Lawyers might get involved.\n\n450\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.540\nDaniel might decide to sue us.\n\n451\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.090\nWhere as if it was spelled\nout in the policy, three or\n\n452\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.670\nmore violations of this particular policy,\nand\n\n453\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:43.370\nyou are no longer eligible for\nthe bonus for the quarter.\n\n454\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.020\nOkay it's spelled out in black and\nwhite and\n\n455\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.330\nI'm not saying that's\nan appropriate punishment.\n\n456\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.470\n&gt;&gt; It's just a for instance.\n\n457\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a for instance.\n\n458\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.790\nSo we do have to make sure that we're\nspelling out what the repercussions are in\n\n459\n00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.830\nthe policy.\n\n460\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.460\nWhat is considered a violation?\n\n461\n00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.270\nHow we're gonna determine that\nthere's been a violation?\n\n462\n00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.543\nHow that's gonna be reported?\n\n463\n00:24:00.543 --> 00:24:01.804\nWhat actions are gonna be taken?\n\n464\n00:24:01.804 --> 00:24:02.761\nWhat sanctions are gonna be taken?\n\n465\n00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:06.850\nOkay, immediately we need to change\nDaniel's password right now and\n\n466\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.563\nWe're gonna give you an informal write-up.\n\n467\n00:24:09.563 --> 00:24:11.662\nNext time,\nit's gonna be a formal write-up.\n\n468\n00:24:11.662 --> 00:24:14.159\nThird time,\nit's gonna be another formal write-up.\n\n469\n00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:16.380\nAnd then, you'll get demoted.\n\n470\n00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.860\nYou know what I'm saying.\n\n471\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.650\nSo anyway, I think we get the idea there.\n\n472\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.020\nWe beat that one enough.\n\n473\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.430\nRevisions and updates schedule.\n\n474\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:27.470\nWe need to know In the policy it\nshould specify who is responsible for\n\n475\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.235\ndoing revisions.\n\n476\n00:24:28.235 --> 00:24:32.930\nA policy isn't something that's set\nin stone and hung up on the wall and\n\n477\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.850\nframed and never touched again.\n\n478\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.780\nPolicies are living documents\nwithin my organization.\n\n479\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.420\nOur organization changes,\nthe technologies we use change, and\n\n480\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.690\nthat's gonna change my policy.\n\n481\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.880\nAnd so the policy has to remain relevant,\n\n482\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.410\nwhich means we have to reexamine\nthose on a scheduled basis typically.\n\n483\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.170\nNow how often that is\nDepends on the policy,\n\n484\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.220\ndepends on your organization,\nthere is no black and white, but\n\n485\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.830\nit is something that we need to\ndefine within the policy itself.\n\n486\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.090\nHey, this policy was written on such and\nsuch, enacted in such and\n\n487\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.930\nsuch date, it will be revisited six\nmonths from now, or every quarter, or\n\n488\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.440\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n489\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.790\nAnd then who is going to be\nresponsible for, doing that revision.\n\n490\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.810\nContact information.\n\n491\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.270\nWhat if I'm reading the policy,\nbut I don't understand something?\n\n492\n00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.980\nWho do I go to?\n\n493\n00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.620\nWho do I talk to?\n\n494\n00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.570\nWho can I ask?\n\n495\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.430\nRight?\nThat information should be included.\n\n496\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.220\nSo, contact information.\n\n497\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.560\nAnd, then definitions, or a glossary.\n\n498\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.400\nThis is often overlooked.\n\n499\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.300\nIt does have to do with who\nthe audience is for the policy.\n\n500\n00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.680\nI might be writing a policy\nthat's dealing with patching and\n\n501\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.360\nhardening systems, and the people that\nare reading this policy are my IT people.\n\n502\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.150\nAnd so they're technically versed and\n\n503\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.900\nI can get away with using some of those\ntechnical terms, and maybe even acronyms.\n\n504\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.330\nWe try to avoid that, but\nacronyms can help shorten up things.\n\n505\n00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.270\nSo as long as we include a glossary.\n\n506\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.820\nBut then if it's an end user type policy.\n\n507\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.290\nI really need to stay away\nfrom those technical terms.\n\n508\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.130\nI need to put this in layman terms.\n\n509\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.460\nI'm not trying to impress them\nwith my vocabulary at this point.\n\n510\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.080\nI need to make sure they\nunderstand the policy.\n\n511\n00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.720\nSo use the appropriate terms.\n\n512\n00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.150\nAnd if there are terms that\nyou can't get away from.\n\n513\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.070\nBecause you have to use a technical\nterm or industry specific term or\n\n514\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.720\nsomething, make sure you have\na glossary at the end of your policy,\n\n515\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:29.480\nthe defines term you've use that you might\nthink people have might not understand or\n\n516\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.840\nacronyms if you use\nthat acronyms in there.\n\n517\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.285\nMake sure, nothing worse than going and\nreading something and\n\n518\n00:26:35.285 --> 00:26:38.935\nyou got this acronym and okay,\nI scroll back up, I scroll back up.\n\n519\n00:26:38.935 --> 00:26:41.003\nCuz everybody knows that\nif you use an acronym only,\n\n520\n00:26:41.003 --> 00:26:43.645\nyou must have used it before somewhere and\nspelled it out, right?\n\n521\n00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:44.177\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n522\n00:26:44.177 --> 00:26:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Not always.\n\n523\n00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.530\n&gt;&gt; Not always, make sure you do that,\nthat is a good thing.\n\n524\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.450\nTypically, you guys have seen it, and\n\n525\n00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.670\ngals, you use the full word or\nwords and phrase.\n\n526\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.060\nAnd then in parentheses put the acronym,\n\n527\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.410\nand then after that you can get\naway with just using the acronym.\n\n528\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.140\nIf you're not gonna do that,\n\n529\n00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.750\nif you're gonna use the acronym\nthroughout the entire thing,\n\n530\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.040\nyou'd best have a glossary at the end\nthat defines all those acronyms.\n\n531\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.560\nSo that we can look them up.\n\n532\n00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.390\nAnd then, yeah, so I covered acronyms,\ndefinitions, glossaries.\n\n533\n00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.400\nSo those are the big parts again,\n\n534\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.770\nlet's review those I'll double check my\nlist make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n535\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:25.330\nWell written policies are gonna include,\npurpose, what is this policy for?\n\n536\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.390\nScope, who does this policy apply to?\n\n537\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.008\nRoles and responsibilities,\nwho's responsible for\n\n538\n00:27:31.008 --> 00:27:34.330\nenacting whats defined in this policy?\n\n539\n00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.270\nSanctions and violation what's gonna\nhappen if you violate the policy,\n\n540\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.200\nhow we gonna determine?\n\n541\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.069\nIf there's has been violation,\nrevisions and\n\n542\n00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:46.550\nupdating who's going to be responsible for\nthat.\n\n543\n00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.670\nContent information if I have questions,\nglossary, acronyms.\n\n544\n00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.330\nAll those should be in\nyour well-written policy.\n\n545\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.380\nThe last thing they\nmention in this objective\n\n546\n00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.870\nis how policies serve as insurance.\n\n547\n00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.456\nAnd it really boils down\nto proving compliance.\n\n548\n00:28:05.456 --> 00:28:05.993\nRight.\n\n549\n00:28:05.993 --> 00:28:06.942\nIt ensures,\n\n550\n00:28:06.942 --> 00:28:12.810\nremember when we talked about insurance\nwe're trying to make sure that we have,\n\n551\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:18.073\nwhat's a good way to define insurance\nI don't want to say a back up plan,\n\n552\n00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:24.240\nbut it gives me the ability to ensure that\nI am compliant with say legal regulations.\n\n553\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.014\nRight or let's say I have to follow\nHIPAA regulations, or Sarbanes Oxley or\n\n554\n00:28:29.014 --> 00:28:30.860\nsomething like that.\n\n555\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.040\nWell my policies are gonna help me\nensure that we are doing that, right.\n\n556\n00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.690\nThat I'm not just hoping I've read\nHIPAA I understand most of it and\n\n557\n00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.699\nI think we're implementing it.\n\n558\n00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.850\nHopefully.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n559\n00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Or I have a policy that spells out how\n\n560\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.530\nwe are compliant.\n\n561\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.940\nWhen auditors come in,\nthey can see that, and\n\n562\n00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.370\nthey know that we are doing what we can\nto be compliant with those regulations.\n\n563\n00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:58.820\nSo, really does help us prove compliance,\nin the end.\n\n564\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.830\nAnd make sure that we're We're doing\neverything that we need to be doing.\n\n565\n00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, I know that you've got\nactually a bit more to talk about when it\n\n566\n00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.380\ncomes to risk, risk management,\n\n567\n00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.060\nsome technical aspects to it, but\nwe're well out of time for this episode.\n\n568\n00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.600\nBut we've covered a lot of ground so\n\n569\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.510\nfar and we really appreciate your\nability to walk us down that path.\n\n570\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.670\nWe hope that you'll join\nus in that part two,\n\n571\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.500\ncontinue your education\non risk management.\n\n572\n00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.340\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n573\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.990\nFor ITProTV I've been your host,\nDaniel Laury.\n\n574\n00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n575\n00:29:27.990 -->

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:06.041\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.164\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:12.087\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.786\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.000\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're back.\n\n9\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.140\nThat's right with more\nGIAC Security Essentials, right?\n\n10\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.030\nThat's a lot of fun,\na lot of fun to say, a lot of fun to do.\n\n11\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.080\nAnd rounding out a part two,\nthat's what we're here for\n\n12\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.780\non risk, is our good friend joining\nus today, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.668\nMike, welcome back sir.\n\n14\n00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:35.480\nGlad to have you again.\n\n15\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.966\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back.\n\n16\n00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.545\nExcited to be here, as always.\n\n17\n00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.470\nAnd, yeah, continuing on with\ngood old risk management.\n\n18\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.650\nIn this episode, we're gonna take a look\nat a couple different methodologies that\n\n19\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.230\nwe use when we're doing risk management,\nor more specifically,\n\n20\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.640\nprobably risk assessment.\n\n21\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.550\nBut that is part of risk management.\n\n22\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.501\nWe're also gonna take a look at some\nof the risk approaches that we can use,\n\n23\n00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:00.219\nas well as a couple of the formulas\nwe would use when calculating risk.\n\n24\n00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.259\nKeep in mind, this is a high\nlevel look at risk management.\n\n25\n00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.268\nSo, again, the first thing I\nwant to talk about is some risk\n\n26\n00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:11.865\nassessment methodologies, and there's\ntwo big ones that we want to understand.\n\n27\n00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:15.785\nWe can do what we call\nquantitative risk assessment and\n\n28\n00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.805\nwe can do qualitative risk assessment.\n\n29\n00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:22.875\nAnd the big difference there is when\nwe talk about quantitative, all right,\n\n30\n00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.925\nwe're talking about numerical values.\n\n31\n00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:25.449\nThat's the big thing.\n\n32\n00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:30.618\nWhereas qualitative is a very\nsubjective methodology that we can use,\n\n33\n00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:33.731\nand it's not as, well it's subjective.\n\n34\n00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:37.820\nThere's no actual dollar value placed.\n\n35\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.630\nIt's more of like a high,\nmedium, low, if you will.\n\n36\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.470\nSo it is a little bit\non the subjective side.\n\n37\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.660\nSo you might think well, why use it?\n\n38\n00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.650\nWhy would we ever do qualitative if\nquantitative is gonna give us actual\n\n39\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.170\nnumbers and values that I can use?\n\n40\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.710\nWell, because,\nqualitative is a lot more difficult to do.\n\n41\n00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.960\nI'm sorry, quantitative is--I\n\n42\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.870\nget these two\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n43\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Easy to get them reversed there.\n\n44\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.674\n&gt;&gt; You had to start with q.\n\n45\n00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:04.913\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The quantitative.\n\n46\n00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:08.502\nThe one where we've got the actual\nnumbers is a lot harder to do,\n\n47\n00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:10.710\nbecause it involves a lot of research.\n\n48\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.420\nYou have to know what\nnumbers to be plugging in.\n\n49\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.570\nThat means you've got to do your\ndue diligence and do your research.\n\n50\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.750\nNow, granted,\n\n51\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.070\nit gets easier over time because you've\nalready got some of the numbers.\n\n52\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.110\nBut especially the first one,\nIt'll be rough going.\n\n53\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.120\nIt'll take a lot of man hours to do.\n\n54\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.650\nWhereas, qualitative,\nbeing subjective I can brainstorm.\n\n55\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.760\nWe can get everybody together.\n\n56\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.120\nWe can just sit down and agree upon\nsomething, and that's what it is.\n\n57\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.320\nSo it's a lot easier to do.\n\n58\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.280\nLittle bit simpler,\n\n59\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.450\nespecially if you have non-technical\nstaff doing the risk assessment.\n\n60\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.990\nIt's a lot easier for them, whereas\nthe quantitative it's a numeric value,\n\n61\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.650\nso it can be more useful\nbased on known metrics.\n\n62\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.825\nAnd our results are typically expressed\nas monetary or percentages, all right?\n\n63\n00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:03.700\nBut there are, like I said,\nthe cons, large amount of work.\n\n64\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.050\nDoing the quantitative,\na lot of research involved,\n\n65\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.700\na lot of time spent doing this, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.930\nSo let's take a look at just\nsome very simple examples here\n\n67\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.140\nof quantitative versus qualitative.\n\n68\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.830\nAnd I've got a little risk matrix\nwe can take a peek at as well.\n\n69\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.670\nAnd we'll start off with qualitative.\n\n70\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.459\nYou know this one,\nI think I got this one off NIST as\n\n71\n00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.260\nan example of a little\nchart that they were using.\n\n72\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.660\nBut this would be an example of\ndoing a qualitative assessment.\n\n73\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.330\nNow you first have to\nthink about your assets.\n\n74\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.670\nWhat assets do I need to\ndo my risk assessment on?\n\n75\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.820\nSo they've got like credit card\ninformation that we're storing,\n\n76\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.310\nnetwork documentation, marketing\ndocuments versus employee records.\n\n77\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.160\nAnd then they've got some vulnerabilities\nthat those particular assets would face.\n\n78\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.410\nLoss of confidentiality, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.070\nSo, that information\ngetting released to people\n\n80\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.760\nthat were not authorized\nto see that information.\n\n81\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.670\nLoss of integrity, the data has been\nchanged and it shouldn't have been or\n\n82\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.190\nshouldn't have been allowed to.\n\n83\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.410\nLoss of availability,\nhard drive failures, data deletion,\n\n84\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.930\ncorruption, things like that.\n\n85\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.000\nAll of these assets would face\nthose types of vulnerabilities.\n\n86\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.240\nAnd so\nwhat we've done is we just said okay,\n\n87\n00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.069\nwell, I've got my credit card information,\nif we lose confidentiality on that\n\n88\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.950\nis that gonna be a low impact,\na medium or a high impact?\n\n89\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.660\nIt's gonna be high, right?\n\n90\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.077\nAnd again,\nthis is not a set in stone thing.\n\n91\n00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:37.328\nThis is something that your organization\nis going to determine but for\n\n92\n00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:41.680\nan example, let's pretend that's high,\nbecause we've got PCI.\n\n93\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.300\nWe've got regulations that I'm going to\nget fined if this information is released\n\n94\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.750\nto unauthorized people.\n\n95\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.440\nI've got customers that are gonna\nbe really upset with me\n\n96\n00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.370\nwhen they find out that their credit\ncard information has been released.\n\n97\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.150\nThey're not gonna want\nto shop with me anymore.\n\n98\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.330\nThe news is going to cover it.\n\n99\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.390\nI'm going to lose face in public.\n\n100\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.040\nI'm gonna lose business, so\nthe impact of this would be high.\n\n101\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.580\nWhereas my marketing documents,\nall right, well it's marketing.\n\n102\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.578\nThis is stuff that we put out\nto the public eventually,\n\n103\n00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.870\nas soon as we get it right.\n\n104\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.490\nIf this stuff was to lose confidentiality\nthe impact would not be that high.\n\n105\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.790\nIt's marketing material,\n\n106\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.950\neventually we want everybody to\nsee this information, most likely.\n\n107\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.980\nI mean it depends,\nis it in-house, whatever?\n\n108\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.190\nBut I think you get the idea, right?\n\n109\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.960\nThe idea behind qualitative is that we're\njust going to kind of assign these values.\n\n110\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.260\nTry to determine is it high,\nmedium or low, and you can come\n\n111\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.310\nup with your own scale, three, five steps,\nwhatever you want in your scale.\n\n112\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.292\nAnd the reason we do this in our risk\nassessment is so that I can start,\n\n113\n00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:53.520\nwhat's the word I'm looking for\n\n114\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.340\nhere, I can start prioritizing, right?\n\n115\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.440\nWhere do I need to put my efforts,\nspend my money in mitigating these risks?\n\n116\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.150\nDo I wanna start with\nthe marketing documents?\n\n117\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.060\nNo, it's got a low impact across all\nthree of those vulnerabilities there.\n\n118\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.850\nSo that's probably not\nwhere I'm gonna start.\n\n119\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.010\nI want to get to it eventually,\nbut not where I'm gonna start.\n\n120\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.530\nI can see that credit card information and\n\n121\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.780\nemployee records both have a high\nimpact if I lose confidentiality.\n\n122\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.640\nSo those are where I want to start,\nmaybe those are the ones I want to look at\n\n123\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.380\nhow we can put in controls to make\nsure we maintain that confidentiality.\n\n124\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.650\nThat's where I'm gonna spend my money and\nmy man hours, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.070\nSo that's what we're trying to\ndo here with a qualitative.\n\n126\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.132\nYou've probably seen risk matrix before.\n\n127\n00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.410\nHere we've just taken severity categories,\nand\n\n128\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.400\nyou can do it with a description,\nyou can do it with a number.\n\n129\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.830\nEither way it would work,\nwhatever works for you.\n\n130\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.460\nBut severity they've got\nlike catastrophic, critical,\n\n131\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.250\nmarginal, negligible, and\na severity of one, two, three, four.\n\n132\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.410\nAgain this is from NIST,\nI think I would have gone the other way.\n\n133\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.788\nCatastrophic should be four in my opinion.\n\n134\n00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you know.\n\n135\n00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:06.176\nProbability levels.\n\n136\n00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:14.310\nWhat is the likelihood of occurrence, is\nwhat the probability level is giving me.\n\n137\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.880\nAnd I could use A, B, C, D, E, or\nFrequent, Probable, Occasional,\n\n138\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.720\nRemote, Improbable.\n\n139\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.140\nAnd then we make a matrix out of this,\nright?\n\n140\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.920\nAnd so I can see we might have something,\nand we're gonna list that.\n\n141\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.080\nWhat I don't show you here is listing\nout the vulnerability that we found.\n\n142\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.868\nAnd we've done our business\nimpact analysis to determine\n\n143\n00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:40.753\nthat if this vulnerability was\ndiscovered and acted upon,\n\n144\n00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:44.184\nthe outcome would be critical all right?\n\n145\n00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:47.538\nIt's not catastrophic, but\nit's definitely not marginal.\n\n146\n00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:51.931\nIt'd be critical, and the probability\nof somebody taking advantage\n\n147\n00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:55.588\nof that vulnerability maybe\nwe find is probable, right?\n\n148\n00:07:55.588 --> 00:07:57.745\nA B there on our scale.\n\n149\n00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.455\nSo then we'll say all\nright well it's critical.\n\n150\n00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:04.340\nAnd it's probable, so\nwhere do those two intersect?\n\n151\n00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.286\nRight there in high, right?\n\n152\n00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:09.511\nSo in my risk matrix,\nI've determined that that\n\n153\n00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:13.849\nparticular vulnerability should\nbe on my top of the things to do.\n\n154\n00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.135\nAgain, that's what we're trying\nto do is prioritize our risks so\n\n155\n00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:20.190\nthat we can go through them.\n\n156\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.380\nYou never gonna eliminate all risk.\n\n157\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.870\nBut I can find the ones that\nare gonna have the biggest impact and\n\n158\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.740\nI can focus on those first.\n\n159\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.902\nThat's really what risk\nassessment is all about.\n\n160\n00:08:30.902 --> 00:08:33.144\nThen we can go the quantitative route.\n\n161\n00:08:33.144 --> 00:08:37.284\nAnd when we look at the quantitative,\nagain this is where we're gonna\n\n162\n00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:41.224\nassign numbers, percentages,\nmonetary values to these risks.\n\n163\n00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:44.799\nSo same kind of process, we're gonna\nlook at an asset and we're gonna\n\n164\n00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:49.121\ntalk about all the different risks that\nare associated with that particular asset.\n\n165\n00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:52.386\nAnd again,\nthis is a very simple abbreviated chart.\n\n166\n00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:57.307\nA single asset could have several\ndifferent risks listed for it,\n\n167\n00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.525\nand I would do a business\nimpact analysis on that asset.\n\n168\n00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:06.166\nand I would do my risk analysis on each\none of those vulnerabilities that that\n\n169\n00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:06.971\nrisk faced.\n\n170\n00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:11.485\nBut once we had our asset that we\nneeded to protect, we've got our risk,\n\n171\n00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.864\nloss of data, no backup, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:17.611\nSo determine the asset value for\neach information asset.\n\n173\n00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:22.262\nSo we've determined that my customer\ndatabase is worth $118,000.\n\n174\n00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:24.822\nNow where did I come up with that number,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:24.822 --> 00:09:28.050\nThis is where the work comes in.\n\n176\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.410\nWhat is it actually worth?\n\n177\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.390\nThis is where our business\nimpact analysis comes in.\n\n178\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.981\nIt helps me determine\nwhat these numbers are.\n\n179\n00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:40.147\nI might go to other people\nin the organization.\n\n180\n00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.601\nWe'll brainstorm,\nwe'll talk about what it's worth.\n\n181\n00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.463\nI might go to other organizations\nin the same industry and\n\n182\n00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:50.820\nsee what they consider, right,\nmaybe get some help from them.\n\n183\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.256\nSo we assign our assets and values,\nsome are easier than others,\n\n184\n00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:58.003\nlike if I'm talking about my email\nserver I might be able to put, well,\n\n185\n00:09:58.003 --> 00:10:02.010\nthat one's still gonna be tough because\nthere's a lot of things tied to it.\n\n186\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.638\nAll right, my business impact analysis\nis gonna tell me that the email server's\n\n187\n00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:10.340\nimpact is much more than just\nlosing a physical server.\n\n188\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.386\nBecause a lot of my business\nprocesses rely on an email server.\n\n189\n00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:16.308\nAnd so if the email server goes down,\n\n190\n00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:19.169\nthat impacts several\ndifferent business processes.\n\n191\n00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:23.761\nSo the impact of the asset,\nin this case the email server,\n\n192\n00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.180\nmight be more than just the cost\nof the physical server.\n\n193\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.274\nAnd let's use that one for example.\n\n194\n00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:32.813\nI think the math is pretty\nstraightforward on that one.\n\n195\n00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:34.949\n&gt;&gt; When you said math,\nI just had a heart palpitation, Mike.\n\n196\n00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:37.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have calculators.\n\n197\n00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:39.956\nWe can use calculators on this.\n\n198\n00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:42.084\nBut so determine the asset value.\n\n199\n00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:43.454\nSo again, they've gone,\n\n200\n00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:47.410\nthey've listed all their assets and\nthen we'll assign a value to those.\n\n201\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:52.231\nAll right, identify the threats, what\nare the threats that those assets face?\n\n202\n00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:54.699\nDetermine the exposure factor for\n\n203\n00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:59.301\neach information asset in relation\nto each threat, all right?\n\n204\n00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:01.845\nThis is the one that's\na little bit subjective.\n\n205\n00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:04.805\nAnd it's typically\nrepresented as a percentage.\n\n206\n00:11:06.575 --> 00:11:08.915\nBut we can use things\nto help us with this.\n\n207\n00:11:08.915 --> 00:11:10.935\nIt's not completely subjective.\n\n208\n00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:12.914\nWe use our business impact analysis.\n\n209\n00:11:12.914 --> 00:11:16.213\nWe tie that back into risk assessment.\n\n210\n00:11:16.213 --> 00:11:20.207\nThat business impact analysis can\ntell us what that exposure factor is.\n\n211\n00:11:20.207 --> 00:11:25.029\nAnd the exposure factor is\nwhat we're going to lose in\n\n212\n00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:29.424\nthe event that we lose\nthat resource basically,\n\n213\n00:11:29.424 --> 00:11:33.299\nin relation to the value of that resource.\n\n214\n00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:34.948\nAnd again, I know this is tricky.\n\n215\n00:11:34.948 --> 00:11:39.156\nIt's project management,\nit's risk management.\n\n216\n00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:42.930\nIt's not my cup of tea either,\nbut we have to know it.\n\n217\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.094\nAs being a security professional,\nthis is part of our repertoire.\n\n218\n00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:49.475\nMight not be our everyday thing,\nbut we do have to understand this.\n\n219\n00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:54.763\nSo here, they've given it\nan exposure factor of 75%.\n\n220\n00:11:54.763 --> 00:11:56.996\nSo, it would be 0.75, right?\n\n221\n00:11:56.996 --> 00:11:58.134\nAnd you multiply these two.\n\n222\n00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:02.690\nYou take your asset value,\ncalculate your single loss expectancy.\n\n223\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.235\nSo, if that email server was to go down,\nwhat is it gonna cost me?\n\n224\n00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:12.639\nAnd they've determined that with a net\nvalue of $2,500 and an exposure factor\n\n225\n00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:18.134\nof 75%, then my single loss expectancy\nmight SLE Make sure you know that acronym.\n\n226\n00:12:18.134 --> 00:12:21.194\nThe SLE is 1,875, $1,875,\n\n227\n00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:27.135\nsimple math to calculate that one out,\nright, just multiplying those guys.\n\n228\n00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:31.194\nThen from there, well,\nwe can then figure out,\n\n229\n00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:36.585\ncalculate what our annualized\nrate of occurence is.\n\n230\n00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:38.305\nThis is more research.\n\n231\n00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:43.430\nAll right, how often is that email\nserver going to go down per year?\n\n232\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.770\nI can look at history if I have history.\n\n233\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.390\nWe can see how many times\nhas it gone down last year?\n\n234\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.520\nHow many times did it go\ndown the year before?\n\n235\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.960\nI can talk to other\nprofessionals in the industry.\n\n236\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.350\nOn average,\nhow often does your email server go down?\n\n237\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.200\nWhat are you using for redundancy?\n\n238\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.177\nIn the case of a virus,\nit might not even help.\n\n239\n00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:11.028\nBut we have to determine how often this\nis gonna occur per year, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:14.519\nAnd that is my annual rate of occurence.\n\n241\n00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:17.947\nAnd again,\nit's done here as a percentage so\n\n242\n00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:22.383\nthat it can make the math work out,\nour good old math here.\n\n243\n00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:27.777\nAnd then we're gonna\ncalculate out my annual.\n\n244\n00:13:27.777 --> 00:13:29.801\nThat is not right.\n\n245\n00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.359\nThey've done this, okay, as a percentage.\n\n246\n00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:34.193\nReally, when we're looking at\nthe annual rate of occurrence,\n\n247\n00:13:34.193 --> 00:13:36.860\nyou could specify this\nnumber in a couple of ways.\n\n248\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.650\nAgain, you're gonna have to do your\ndue diligence to find this number out.\n\n249\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.360\nIt's not gonna be typically written\ndown somewhere in documentation,\n\n250\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.670\nbut how often do you expect\nit to occur in a year, right?\n\n251\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.567\nMakes sense, annualized rate of occurence.\n\n252\n00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:57.226\nAnd so they've got it, in their example,\nthe one I got from this tier,\n\n253\n00:13:57.226 --> 00:13:58.555\nyou know, 95%.\n\n254\n00:13:58.555 --> 00:14:04.198\nSo they're basically saying there's\na 95% that this fails once in a year.\n\n255\n00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:07.891\nA lot of times when I'm seeing\nquantitative like this,\n\n256\n00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:11.674\nI'll see it more like we expect\nit to fail twice in a year.\n\n257\n00:14:11.674 --> 00:14:17.910\nSo there'd be 2.0 instead of 0.95 or\nsomething, 200%, something like that.\n\n258\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.630\nSo you could specify those\nnumbers either way but\n\n259\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.020\nthen you just multiple that out, right?\n\n260\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.679\nThese are formulas we need to know, and\n\n261\n00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:26.807\nI'll talk about them again\nhere in just a second.\n\n262\n00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:33.080\nThe annual loss expectancy, which is the\nnumber we really wanna get out of this,\n\n263\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.615\nis calculated by multiplying your SLE,\nyour single loss expectancy,\n\n264\n00:14:38.615 --> 00:14:42.601\ntimes your annual rate of occurence,\nor your ARO.\n\n265\n00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:47.321\nSo they're saying is ALE\n= SLE times ARO is what\n\n266\n00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:51.929\nyou'll hear people say,\nwhich is odd to say.\n\n267\n00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:53.116\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:54.727\n&gt;&gt; But when you talk about it a lot,\n\n269\n00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.680\nI guess it helps to shorten things up.\n\n270\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.945\n&gt;&gt; That's illegal in 16 states.\n\n271\n00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.778\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it makes sense right if\n\n272\n00:15:01.778 --> 00:15:05.968\nwe're saying, okay, this is how much it's\ngonna cost me every time this happens.\n\n273\n00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:09.641\nThis is how many times I expect\nthis to happen in a year.\n\n274\n00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:12.281\nThen, this is how much we're\ngonna lose in that year, or\n\n275\n00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:14.120\nhow much it would cost me in that year.\n\n276\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.370\nYou have things that only fail\nevery three or four years, so\n\n277\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.955\nthey got a 0.25 on your ARO,\non you Annual Rate of Occurence.\n\n278\n00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:23.297\nOr you have things have\nfailed twice a year.\n\n279\n00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.689\nSo it can be 2.0 on those things.\n\n280\n00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:30.245\nBut again, we just calculate,\npull out those numbers,\n\n281\n00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:33.665\nplug them into our formula,\nand generate our output.\n\n282\n00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:37.853\nAnd then we can analyze our risk to\nthe organization as the last step.\n\n283\n00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:40.605\nDecide whether to accept,\nreduce, transfer,\n\n284\n00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:44.100\nwhatever it is we're gonna use or\ndo about this risk.\n\n285\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.750\nAnd how do we determine that?\n\n286\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:52.210\nWell, okay,\nlet's say a virus is gonna cost me.\n\n287\n00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.162\nHonestly, 0.95 is awfully low.\n\n288\n00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:58.749\nSo they're saying that there's a 0.95\nchance of getting affected on that email\n\n289\n00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:59.728\nserver in a year.\n\n290\n00:15:59.728 --> 00:16:02.256\nMaybe you got a really good\nsoftware running on there.\n\n291\n00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:07.403\nKeeping you safe,\nit's only gonna cost me $1,781.\n\n292\n00:16:07.403 --> 00:16:11.181\n&gt;&gt; Maybe on the email server itself,\nit's not gonna get infected.\n\n293\n00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.202\n&gt;&gt; That's what we'll go with,\nthat's what we'll go with.\n\n294\n00:16:13.202 --> 00:16:17.463\nSo then as doing my risk assessment,\nwhat good does this number do to me?\n\n295\n00:16:17.463 --> 00:16:18.970\nWhat is this telling me?\n\n296\n00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.570\nAll right, well here's what I do.\n\n297\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.100\nI look at my antivirus solution\nthat I can put on my email server\n\n298\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.380\nto protect me from this type of threat.\n\n299\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.760\nAnd I realize that it's gonna\ncost me $200 a year for license.\n\n300\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:38.200\nOkay, my annual loss expectancy if that\nserver goes down due to a virus is $1,781.\n\n301\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.178\nI can do away with that risk by running\nantivirus software that's gonna cost\n\n302\n00:16:43.178 --> 00:16:44.517\nme $200 a year.\n\n303\n00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:50.440\nSo my net gain is 1,581, and\nthat means it's worth doing that, right?\n\n304\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.210\nNow if you came to me and said, hey,\nI've got a solution for your email server,\n\n305\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.550\nit is guaranteed you're not gonna\nget infected, great, I like it.\n\n306\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.375\nHow much is it?\n\n307\n00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:01.861\n$4,000 a year for your license.\n\n308\n00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:06.293\nHm, well,\nI like the idea of this software.\n\n309\n00:17:06.293 --> 00:17:07.210\nIt sounds really good.\n\n310\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.089\nBut if you're telling me it's $4,000\na year for my license, and my annual loss\n\n311\n00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.106\nexpectancy according to my risk analysis\nis only $1,700, I think I'm better off\n\n312\n00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:22.017\nleaving that software on the shelf and not\ndealing with it or finding something else.\n\n313\n00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:26.752\nSo that's the idea behind\ndoing your risk assessment.\n\n314\n00:17:26.752 --> 00:17:30.786\nWhether you're doing it qualitative,\nwhether you're doing it quantitative,\n\n315\n00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.139\nyou could do both, right?\n\n316\n00:17:32.139 --> 00:17:32.833\nYou might do both.\n\n317\n00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:37.341\nYou might have an informal qualitative.\n\n318\n00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:39.810\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make sure to get one.\n\n319\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.950\n&gt;&gt; Qualitative process that you do, but\nthen every once in a while you bring\n\n320\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.210\nin the outsiders that can help you do\na quantitative, right, and sit down and\n\n321\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.220\nactually crunch the numbers and\ndo the research and things like that,\n\n322\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.080\nso kinda one or the other, or both even.\n\n323\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.394\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that leaves us kind of like with\nthe end of your number seven analysis\n\n324\n00:17:58.394 --> 00:18:00.932\nthere on your list was what do we do,\nright?\n\n325\n00:18:00.932 --> 00:18:05.280\nAnd there's a few defined\nsteps that we can take, right,\n\n326\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.334\nespecially for G Sec here.\n\n327\n00:18:07.334 --> 00:18:10.595\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, G Sec and here,\nthey're gonna call them and everybody.\n\n328\n00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:11.655\nRIsk approaches right?\n\n329\n00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:15.345\nWhat do we do now that we\nhave this information?\n\n330\n00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.455\nAnd I have basically four choices\nthat we can do, transfer,\n\n331\n00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:20.640\naccept, avoid, and mitigate.\n\n332\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.920\nAll right, transfer, accept,\navoid, and mitigate.\n\n333\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.390\nLet's talk about each one.\n\n334\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:31.480\nTransfer is one that, whether you know\nit or not, you do it all the time.\n\n335\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.760\nDo you have health insurance?\n\n336\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.510\nDo you have car insurance?\n\n337\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.210\nYou're transferring the risk to someone\nelse, in the event that you get sick or\n\n338\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.390\nhave an accident, God forbid.\n\n339\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.962\nThen the insurance company is gonna\nhelp you foot the bill for that.\n\n340\n00:18:44.962 --> 00:18:48.470\nThey're gonna pay for\nsome of the damages to your vehicle, or\n\n341\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.580\nif you have to go to the hospital,\nor what have you, right?\n\n342\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.420\nThat's the idea, is I'm transferring\nthat risk to somebody else.\n\n343\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.380\nKeep in mind, with transferring risk,\n\n344\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.350\nyou do nothing to reduce\nthe chance of the risk, right?\n\n345\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.940\nYou're doing nothing\nto eliminate the risk.\n\n346\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.170\nYou're not fixing it.\n\n347\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.690\nYou're just transferring\nthe risk to a third party, right?\n\n348\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.820\nWhether I,\nif I don't have car insurance, or\n\n349\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.240\nI do have car insurance, the odds of\nme having an accident haven't changed.\n\n350\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.120\nSame thing with cybersecurity, I can\ngo out and get cybersecurity insurance.\n\n351\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.420\nYes, that is a thing.\n\n352\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.390\nAnd you need to look into\nit as an organization.\n\n353\n00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.550\nNowadays especially this is something that\norganizations are buying into because\n\n354\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.150\nthe damages from these exposures, as\nyou've seen in the news with Home Depot.\n\n355\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.690\nand Target and Sony, are very expensive.\n\n356\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.540\nSo they're doing insurance.\n\n357\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.920\nAnd it doesn't reduce the chance\nthat they'll be attacked or hacked.\n\n358\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.130\nBut it does help them save some money.\n\n359\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.420\nIn the event that this does happen,\nI've got insurance for that.\n\n360\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.170\nSo that is transfer.\n\n361\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.970\nRisk is assumed by a third party,\neither partially or completely.\n\n362\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.880\nYou can accept the risk.\n\n363\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.520\nThis is another what we call\nrisk approach is to accept it.\n\n364\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.210\nThis is a risk, I understand it.\n\n365\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.030\nBut maybe the impact is very low, and\n\n366\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.220\nmaybe the rate of occurence is very,\nvery low.\n\n367\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.146\nAnd we just don't feel\nlike we should have,\n\n368\n00:20:16.146 --> 00:20:17.876\nwe're not gonna spend any money on it.\n\n369\n00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:22.755\nThe cost that I need to implement\na control to protect against this risk far\n\n370\n00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:27.556\noutweighs the cost of my annual loss\nexpectancies, like we just did with\n\n371\n00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:32.453\nthe email server and that really\nexpensive antivirus solution, right?\n\n372\n00:20:32.453 --> 00:20:35.766\nI might decide that, yeah, you know what,\nif that's what it's gonna cost me,\n\n373\n00:20:35.766 --> 00:20:36.560\nI can deal with it.\n\n374\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.910\nIt's not worth it and\nprobably not the best example.\n\n375\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.655\nWe really should run antivirus software.\n\n376\n00:20:41.655 --> 00:20:44.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe not $4,000\nantivirus software, right?\n\n377\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.105\nAt that point I'm telling that salesman,\nwhat are you gonna do, right?\n\n378\n00:20:48.105 --> 00:20:50.358\n[LAUGH] I'm just gonna deal with it and\n\n379\n00:20:50.358 --> 00:20:55.510\naccept the risk because 4,000 versus\n1,700 is that's a no-brainer.\n\n380\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you might accept the risk.\n\n381\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.190\nThat is one alternative that you have\nwhen they're doing risk approaches.\n\n382\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.660\nAnother one is to avoid the risk.\n\n383\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.542\n[SOUND] We'll get rid of the email server.\n\n384\n00:21:05.542 --> 00:21:07.340\nNow I can't get a virus\non my email server.\n\n385\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.750\n&gt;&gt; You don't have an email server\nto get a virus with, right?\n\n386\n00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.270\n&gt;&gt; That risk is gone, done, written off,\nchecked off my list, right?\n\n387\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.578\nIt's one less thing I have to deal with.\n\n388\n00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:17.730\nNow obviously, any email server is\nprobably something your organization can't\n\n389\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.880\ndo without, but\nmaybe your organization can.\n\n390\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.810\nOr it's a different risk\nthat we're talking about.\n\n391\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.400\nYou might just, like I said,\navoid it altogether.\n\n392\n00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.750\nSo avoiding the risk,\nremove the vulnerability.\n\n393\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:34.490\nIf we've got software that's posing a risk\nand we look at it and we determine our\n\n394\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.655\nexposure factor, we calculate our SLE, we\ncalculate our ARO, we calculate our ALE,\n\n395\n00:21:39.655 --> 00:21:44.393\nwe know what it's gonna cost us a year,\nand we just determine that the fix is even\n\n396\n00:21:44.393 --> 00:21:48.484\nmore than what it's gonna cost us,\nwe can get rid of that software.\n\n397\n00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:51.907\nMaybe we can find another solution that\ndoesn't have that same vulnerability or\n\n398\n00:21:51.907 --> 00:21:55.530\nanother method to do what we're trying to\naccomplish that doesn't include that same\n\n399\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.812\nvulnerability, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:56.812 --> 00:22:03.200\nOr hurricanes are a vulnerability here\nin Florida that we have to deal with.\n\n401\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.100\nI have to get insurance,\nand that's expensive.\n\n402\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.059\nYou know what we could do?\n\n403\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.894\n&gt;&gt; Move to a different state.\n\n404\n00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:09.130\n&gt;&gt; We could move to Montana.\n\n405\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.700\nThey don't have a lot of hurricanes there.\n\n406\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.200\nWe're avoiding the risk altogether.\n\n407\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.475\n&gt;&gt; It's been a while since\nthey've had a hurricane, I think.\n\n408\n00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:16.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is definitely low on their,\n\n409\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.960\nnot their exposure factor, but the annual\nrate of occurence is gonna be 0.000000001.\n\n410\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Way out there, all right,\n\n411\n00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.180\nso avoid or mitigate,\nwhich means fix the vulnerability.\n\n412\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.430\nThis means using patches,\n\n413\n00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:37.300\npatching up that software,\nbasically removing the vulnerability, but\n\n414\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.710\ndifferent from avoiding and\njust removing the software altogether.\n\n415\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.770\nIn this case,\nwe're gonna continue to run that software.\n\n416\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.130\nWe understand that it has\na risk associated with it.\n\n417\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.830\nWe've done our assessment,\nwe see how much it's gonna cost us.\n\n418\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.640\nBut hey, the vendor's put out some\npatches, we can update that software.\n\n419\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.240\nWe no longer face that vulnerability,\nwe're good to go, all right?\n\n420\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.840\nSo applying vendor patches,\nupgrading that software,\n\n421\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.050\nwhat else might you do?\n\n422\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.788\nAdding cameras to a front door where\none of the risks is physically,\n\n423\n00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:11.780\nsomebody breaking into our building.\n\n424\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.620\nWe've got a decent lock on there.\n\n425\n00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.750\nWe've looked at going high tech.\n\n426\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.400\nWe wanna do fingerprint scanners and\nman traps at every entrance and\n\n427\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:19.990\nthings like that.\n\n428\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.700\nWell, it's a lot of money, and\n\n429\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.970\nthe annual rate of occurrence\nof break-ins is not that high.\n\n430\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.250\nSo my company said no, you can't go out\nand build man traps at every entrance and\n\n431\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.960\nput in biometrics and retinal scanners.\n\n432\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.600\nWe're just not gonna do that.\n\n433\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.880\nSo what we could do is put\nin cameras at the doors.\n\n434\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.760\nThey're gonna deter criminals cuz we're\ngonna see that they're on camera,\n\n435\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.610\nand they're gonna think twice about it,\nright?\n\n436\n00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.740\nOr I'll be able to prosecute.\n\n437\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.370\nSo it's another way we could\nmitigate a particular type of risk.\n\n438\n00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.985\nSo four basic risk\napproaches that you can do.\n\n439\n00:23:50.985 --> 00:23:53.963\nTransfer, have somebody else\nassume the risk for you.\n\n440\n00:23:53.963 --> 00:23:57.422\nIt's gonna cost you money, but\nthat's what we do with insurance.\n\n441\n00:23:57.422 --> 00:23:59.530\nAccept, don't take any action at all.\n\n442\n00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.669\nSay I understand the risk,\nwe've done our assessment And\n\n443\n00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:06.910\nwe're gonna to choose to just let it be\nas the impact is not gonna be that great.\n\n444\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.000\nAvoid, remove\nthe vulnerability altogether.\n\n445\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.230\nDon't use that software that\nhas that vulnerability.\n\n446\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.190\nMove to a state where they\ndon't have earthquakes.\n\n447\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.790\nOr mitigate, do something about it.\n\n448\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.470\nFix it.\n\n449\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.960\nUse compensating controls,\npatches if you're talking about software,\n\n450\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.140\nfirmware updates.\n\n451\n00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.660\nThings like that that we can\ndo to fix the vulnerability.\n\n452\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.870\nMaybe I can go in and\n\n453\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.080\nreverse engineer some of the code and\nwrite my own patch for it.\n\n454\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.256\nOr fix that vulnerability somehow.\n\n455\n00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:37.393\nOr we can look at that website and the\nauthentication method that we're using,\n\n456\n00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:42.421\nI guess that'd be more of a, Well,\n\n457\n00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:44.760\nthat would probably fit in there\nif we said we were going to.\n\n458\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.320\nI was gonna say it'd be avoid if\nwe changed authentication methods.\n\n459\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.947\nReally that's avoiding,\nas we would now go to a different method,\n\n460\n00:24:51.947 --> 00:24:53.477\nwe're avoiding the risk altogether.\n\n461\n00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:56.322\nBut if it was something that was\ncommon in all authentication methods.\n\n462\n00:24:56.322 --> 00:24:59.080\nAnd we're now gonna encrypt\nthe traffic between the two,\n\n463\n00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.150\nbetween the authentication server and\nthe web server.\n\n464\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.550\nOkay, well now we're mitigating that risk,\nwe're doing something about it.\n\n465\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.190\nSo, those are your different\napproaches that you can do.\n\n466\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.880\nLast thing again was calculating risk,\nand we've really already covered that.\n\n467\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.860\nWe talked about the SLE,\nknow those acronyms, know these formulas.\n\n468\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.050\nAny time they ask you questions\nabout risk on any exam,\n\n469\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.270\nthese are some of the common questions\nif it's a basic risk management.\n\n470\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.180\nSLE right my single loss expectancy\n\n471\n00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.230\nis my asset value times\nmy exposure factor right?\n\n472\n00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.512\nWhat that asset is worth, and\n\n473\n00:25:32.512 --> 00:25:38.548\nwhat it's gonna cost me if that particular\nvulnerability is brought to life.\n\n474\n00:25:38.548 --> 00:25:44.163\nThen my ALE, my annualized loss\nexpectancy is SLE times ARO, right?\n\n475\n00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:48.780\nMy single loss expectancy times\nmy annual rate of occurrence.\n\n476\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.960\nAnnual rate of occurrence,\nyou can do that as a percentage or\n\n477\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.480\nI guess a number's a number.\n\n478\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n479\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.860\n&gt;&gt; Typically when I'm working with things,\nthe ones I've done,\n\n480\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.000\nit's usually whole numbers.\n\n481\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.016\nBut percentages work, too.\n\n482\n00:26:01.016 --> 00:26:05.646\nIf it's something that only\noccurs once every five years well\n\n483\n00:26:05.646 --> 00:26:09.934\nthen it's a 0.2% chance of\nit happening it per year.\n\n484\n00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:10.732\nI think I did my math right?\n\n485\n00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:13.061\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, you said math and\nI got flop sweats.\n\n486\n00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:17.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that and me aren't friends [LAUGH].\n\n487\n00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:18.980\nWell, Mike we do appreciate you.\n\n488\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.060\nI mean this is risk right?\n\n489\n00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.490\nThis is all what it's about.\n\n490\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.100\nComing in, getting a high level overview.\n\n491\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.700\nThis is nowhere near a deep in\ndepth dive into risk management.\n\n492\n00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.508\nWe have shows for that, and trust me,\nit does get a little weighty.\n\n493\n00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:34.287\nAnd that's why those people\nare paid well for what they do,\n\n494\n00:26:34.287 --> 00:26:37.022\nbecause it's very difficult\nto figure these things out.\n\n495\n00:26:37.022 --> 00:26:38.953\nAn interesting field to get into\nif you're interested though.\n\n496\n00:26:38.953 --> 00:26:40.457\nBut as far as security goes,\n\n497\n00:26:40.457 --> 00:26:43.410\nwe need to understand\nthe concepts of risk management.\n\n498\n00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.508\nBecause people that do risk management for\n\n499\n00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:48.790\na living are gonna be telling\nyou here's where your risk is.\n\n500\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.190\nYou need to now address those and\n\n501\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.950\nyou have your ways in which you can\ndo that which we just discussed.\n\n502\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.280\nBut Mike we do appreciate\nyou wrapping that up so\n\n503\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.330\nelegantly in a pretty pink\npackage with a bow in it on top.\n\n504\n00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.960\nThat's always a nice thing cuz he's so\ngood at his job.\n\n505\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.649\nWe do appreciate you good\nfolks joining us as well.\n\n506\n00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:08.217\nBut as you can tell it's time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n507\n00:27:08.217 --> 00:27:09.621\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n508\n00:27:09.621 --> 00:27:10.492\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n509\n00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:12.921\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n510\n00:27:12.921 -->

00:00:08.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.977\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:14.001\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.667\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.091\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:23.800\nAnd today's episode, we're back with more\nof our GIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.010\nAnd joining us in the studio,\nagain, our good friend,\n\n10\n00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820\nour gunning star in this endeavor,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.420\nMike, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.290\nExcited to be here, as always.\n\n14\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310\nIn this episode, we are,\nas you say, continuing on.\n\n15\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.661\nWe're gonna be looking at\nattacks in malware, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.993\nSo we're gonna talk about some of\nthe different types of malware that we're\n\n17\n00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:44.730\ngonna find out.\n\n18\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.740\nTheir just have a general understanding\nof the different types of malware,\n\n19\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.550\nwe have to deal with as well as\nsome of the common attack methods,\n\n20\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.346\nmethodologies that they use.\n\n21\n00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:56.480\nAgain, I just wanna have a good\nunderstanding of these different methods,\n\n22\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.730\ncuz if we don't understand what types of\nattacks we're gonna be facing, we'll have\n\n23\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.568\na much more difficult time securing\nour networks against cyber attacks.\n\n24\n00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:08.829\nSo let's out talking about some of\nthe different types of attacks,\n\n25\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.850\nsome of the methodology.\n\n26\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.364\nThe first thing that comes to mind,\nDaniel, is the term malware.\n\n27\n00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.980\nAnd malware is an umbrella term, isn't it?\n\n28\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.860\nIt really does mean quite a few things to\ndifferent people, so it's hard to define.\n\n29\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.320\nBut if I was put under the gun and\nforced to define malware-\n\n30\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.219\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, let me get my gun.\n\n31\n00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.640\n&gt;&gt; Mike's, he's gonna do it, I swear.\n\n33\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.397\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, what I'm gonna do is if we're\ngonna define malware, it's really any\n\n34\n00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:42.588\ntype of software that's doing\nsomething that we don't want it to do.\n\n35\n00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:43.595\nAgain, it's an umbrella term.\n\n36\n00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:44.137\n&gt;&gt; So Word.\n\n37\n00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.178\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Outlook\n\n38\n00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:47.060\n&gt;&gt; It's all malware [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.660\n&gt;&gt; The majority of the Office product,\n\n40\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.250\nI'll give you that.\n\n41\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.038\nBut you know, usually it has\nsome malicious intent behind it.\n\n42\n00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:58.562\nA lot of times requires some\nkind of user interaction.\n\n43\n00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.970\nSo like I said, it is a hard one to\ndefine, cuz it really lumps everything.\n\n44\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.580\nWe're talking about malware nowadays.\n\n45\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.491\nThat's gonna include things like viruses,\nand worms, and Trojan Horses, and\n\n46\n00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.864\nspyware, and adware,\nand keystroke loggers.\n\n47\n00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:14.282\nAnd all of these different things\nreally could be considered malware.\n\n48\n00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:15.810\nSo that one, like I said.\n\n49\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Like software with either a slightly or\nvery nefarious purpose.\n\n50\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it could just have been\nsoftware that started out good, and\n\n51\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.120\nit's been manipulated or\ntwisted around to act as malware, or\n\n52\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.060\nit could have been designed\nas that from the beginning.\n\n53\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.120\nPhishing is another very common\nattack methodology we see today.\n\n54\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.730\nLike I said, we really want us\nto talk about the ones that\n\n55\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.860\nare common today that we see, and\nmalware is definitely up there.\n\n56\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.370\nWe're always getting,\nwe'll keep talking about it.\n\n57\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.340\nPhishing, right?\n\n58\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.930\nThis is another big one that's out there\nnow that we're having to defend against.\n\n59\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.460\nThis is when you get those emails, so\n\n60\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.950\nyou've got a long lost relative\nthat's left you just tons of money.\n\n61\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.280\nOr hey, your password for\nsuch and such needs to be updated.\n\n62\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.040\nClick on this link, open this attachment.\n\n63\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.640\nThat kind of thing,\nthose are phishing scams.\n\n64\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.630\nWe're trying to get you to open up\nyour email, then we want you to\n\n65\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.810\nclick on a link in that email, and\nwe're most likely gonna direct you to\n\n66\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.730\na server that looks like something you\nmight wanna do, but it's not, right?\n\n67\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.590\nThat's the idea behind phishing.\n\n68\n00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.620\nI'm gonna send you an email that\nlooks like it's from Bank of America,\n\n69\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.070\nand it says you need to update\nyour account information.\n\n70\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.420\nAnd when you click on it, it takes you\nto a site that looks just like Bank of\n\n71\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.050\nAmerica, and\nyou attempt to enter your credentials.\n\n72\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.392\nMost likely, that's gonna fail, because\nit's not the actual Bank of America site.\n\n73\n00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:43.080\nBut nonetheless, somebody at the other\nend of that fake Bank of America site\n\n74\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.480\nhas now captured your credentials, right?\n\n75\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.690\nSo that's the idea behind phishing.\n\n76\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.320\nSQL injection attacks, another big one\nthat we have to deal with nowadays.\n\n77\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.710\nSome people call it a command injection,\n\n78\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.620\nbecause it's not always SQL,\nas in Microsoft SQL server.\n\n79\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.921\nBut any of the transacts SQL\nare structured career language,\n\n80\n00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:08.216\nrelational database management engines\nthat process SQL, the language,\n\n81\n00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:12.533\nTSQL, technically,\ntransact structured query language.\n\n82\n00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:13.733\nIt could be susceptible, right?\n\n83\n00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:18.291\nIf we're accepting user input,\nlike a username and password field, or\n\n84\n00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.102\nwe've got a blog or\na place where people can leave comments,\n\n85\n00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:26.460\nthey might be able to get the processed\non the back end by our servers.\n\n86\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.150\nIf they can put in a malicious command,\nthey could potentially retrieve data out\n\n87\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.890\nof our databases, or delete data,\nexpose that information.\n\n88\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.715\nAny number of things can go bad there.\n\n89\n00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:41.535\nCross-site scripting,\nanother very common one.\n\n90\n00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:46.105\nThese are all gonna be up on your top tens\nof attacks that we're seeing nowadays.\n\n91\n00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:50.005\nAnd cross-site scripting is\nwhen I want to attack a victim,\n\n92\n00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.055\nI've got a victim in mind.\n\n93\n00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:53.275\nBut rather than attack them directly,\n\n94\n00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:57.285\nwe're going to attack a vulnerable website\nthat I know the victim is going to.\n\n95\n00:04:57.285 --> 00:05:00.795\nAnd I can put my malicious code there,\nand then when that user,\n\n96\n00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:04.450\nmy victim,\nmy intended victim goes to that website,\n\n97\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.770\nthat's when that code can\nbe run by their browser.\n\n98\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.000\nAgain, we put malicious code up in\nthere on the vulnerable website.\n\n99\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.550\nWhen a user visits that site,\nthey download that webpage,\n\n100\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.980\nthat script is executed or the code\nis executed, and they get attacked.\n\n101\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.740\nSo the intended victim of a cross-site\nscripting is not the website\n\n102\n00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.140\nitself, right?\n\n103\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.580\nBut it's the visitors to the website\nare the actual targets of the attack.\n\n104\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.510\nDenial of service is one\nthat we hear about a lot.\n\n105\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.360\nThis one, the concept behind denial of\nservice is just making a service so\n\n106\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.060\nbusy that it can't do\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n107\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.910\nIt cannot respond to legitimate requests.\n\n108\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.680\nSo if I've got a website, they can handle\nso many requests per second, per minute,\n\n109\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.650\nwhat have you.\n\n110\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.297\nThe idea is I'm going to\nflood it with requests so\n\n111\n00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:56.666\nthat it's super busy trying to\nanswer all of these requests.\n\n112\n00:05:56.666 --> 00:06:00.351\nAnd then, say Daniel, a legitimate user,\ntries to go to the website, and\n\n113\n00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.343\nit can't get to it, because it's too busy,\nit can't handle all the requests.\n\n114\n00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:10.789\n[COUGH] So denial of service, and\nthat's one form of denial of service.\n\n115\n00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.754\nAnything I can do to prevent you from\naccessing a service would be considered\n\n116\n00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:17.080\ndenial of service.\n\n117\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.870\nI mean, technically,\n\n118\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.960\nif I unplugged your DNS server,\nthat's a denial of service, right?\n\n119\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.630\nCuz you could no longer get DNS service.\n\n120\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.036\nSo we all wanna think about it as\nstrictly an electronic attack, but\n\n121\n00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:31.766\nmost of the time, it is,\nunless I have physical access.\n\n122\n00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.253\nWe can also talk about\ndistributed denial of service,\n\n123\n00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:37.834\nprobably a good time to mention that term,\njust to make sure we're complete.\n\n124\n00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:41.456\nAnd with a denial of service,\nI'm trying to make something busy so\n\n125\n00:06:41.456 --> 00:06:45.915\nthat it can't do it's normal job, but a\nlot of times, the target of this denial of\n\n126\n00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:49.173\nservice attack has more resources\nthan the attacker does.\n\n127\n00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:50.865\nSo what do I do as an attacker?\n\n128\n00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:53.477\nMultiply my resources, right?\n\n129\n00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:58.109\nWe use things like zombies and\nbotnets to increase my attack power, so\n\n130\n00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:02.268\nthat now, I have more resources\nthan the intended target, and\n\n131\n00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:05.506\nhopefully, I can do a denial\nof service on that.\n\n132\n00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:09.992\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then you have the reflective and\namplified type of denial services,\n\n133\n00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:13.357\nwhere you send off a beacon,\nand it multiplies itself and\n\n134\n00:07:13.357 --> 00:07:16.260\nthen goes toward the target,\nso you have this.\n\n135\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.393\nIt gets really complicated.\n\n136\n00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:20.550\nDenial of service seems like\none of the most simple like, so\n\n137\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.717\nI can't go to that website,\n[INAUDIBLE] do.\n\n138\n00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:24.230\nWell, what if that website is amazon.com?\n\n139\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.470\nAll of a sudden, you get the idea\nthat if I can't access amazon.com,\n\n140\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.750\nhow much money are they losing per second\nthat somebody can't get to their website.\n\n141\n00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.090\nIt becomes very important.\n\n142\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many of you have gone to a\nwebsite, and it was slow, or unresponsive,\n\n143\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.730\nor you get a page not found?\n\n144\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.660\nDid you ever go back?\n\n145\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.160\nIf that was your first\ntime visiting this site.\n\n146\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.880\nHey, my buddy told me about this place I\ncan go to buy these really cool widgets,\n\n147\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.300\nI go there, their site's not working.\n\n148\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.350\nSo what do I do?\n\n149\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.400\nI search for\nanother site that sells the same widgets.\n\n150\n00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.360\nI go there, I buy the widgets, and\nthat first site will never see me again.\n\n151\n00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.674\nThey've lost business,\nthey lose face, I guess, if you will.\n\n152\n00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:06.093\n&gt;&gt; Session hijacking,\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n153\n00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:09.535\nThis is when I'm going to\neither try to session hijack,\n\n154\n00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:12.328\nwhere I try to take over\nan existing session.\n\n155\n00:08:12.328 --> 00:08:14.654\nRather than try to break into a server,\n\n156\n00:08:14.654 --> 00:08:19.039\nmaybe I wait until a legitimate\nauthorized user connects to that server.\n\n157\n00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.289\nAnd then bump them out of the way,\nand take over.\n\n158\n00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:25.685\nStealing session information, trying to\nassume the identity of that session, or\n\n159\n00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:28.909\nman in the middle attacks,\nreally we take it a step further.\n\n160\n00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:31.649\nAnd rather than bump\nthe original user off,\n\n161\n00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:34.650\nI just sit in between the conversation.\n\n162\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.570\nSo, Daniel and party z over here having a\nconversation, I slip in between them, and\n\n163\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.700\nI just watch the information go back and\nforth as they communicate.\n\n164\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.684\n&gt;&gt; Man,\nthat party z's a crazy character, too.\n\n165\n00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:49.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:50.732\n&gt;&gt; And then credential reuse would be\n\n167\n00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:51.423\nanother one.\n\n168\n00:08:51.423 --> 00:08:52.255\nA lot of times,\n\n169\n00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:56.804\nthis is associated with session hijacking\nbecause I've stolen your credentials.\n\n170\n00:08:56.804 --> 00:09:01.587\nAnd they might be encrypted, but\nI can turn around and try to replay them.\n\n171\n00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:06.259\nDepending on what authentication methods\nare being used, I might be able to\n\n172\n00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:11.084\nauthenticate as you by just resubmitting\nyour authentication information.\n\n173\n00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:15.050\nSo mitigation techniques for these.\n\n174\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.776\nIt's malware,\nrunning good antivirus software,\n\n175\n00:09:18.776 --> 00:09:21.662\neducating users about what to click on.\n\n176\n00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:25.677\nWhat to not click on,\nI guess would be more important.\n\n177\n00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:27.352\nSame thing for phishing, right?\n\n178\n00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:31.943\nUnderstanding, was I expecting\nan email for this person?\n\n179\n00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:35.800\n&gt;&gt; There's not a prince in Mumbai that\nwants to give you umpteen billion dollars\n\n180\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.403\nout there.\n\n181\n00:09:36.403 --> 00:09:38.634\nSo do not click that link.\n\n182\n00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:40.790\nYou gotta use a little common sense.\n\n183\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.340\nBut they try to make it look really real,\n\n184\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.126\nwhich is where the training\ncomes in handy.\n\n185\n00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:50.761\nWhere you say, okay, DHL sent me an email\nsaying I've got a package waiting,\n\n186\n00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.180\nI should click on that.\n\n187\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.080\nWhat is this package?\n\n188\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.882\nDo you have a package that\nyou're expecting, right?\n\n189\n00:09:56.882 --> 00:10:00.841\nWe just have to think of these things\nlogically, always have some sort\n\n190\n00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.951\nof cynicism in play when something\ncomes in that you're not expecting.\n\n191\n00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:08.595\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it amazes me how many people\nthink, I haven't ordered anything,\n\n192\n00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:11.482\ngetting ship by DHL, but\nI'll go ahead and click on the link.\n\n193\n00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:12.379\n&gt;&gt; I gotta see what this is.\n\n194\n00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.118\n&gt;&gt; I know, absolutely,\nmaybe they made a mistake and\n\n195\n00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:15.620\nthey're shipping me a big TV or something.\n\n196\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.334\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n197\n00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:17.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, that's not the way it works, right?\n\n198\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.761\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't happen.\n\n199\n00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:24.517\n&gt;&gt; Nobody, no company out there is ever\ngonna send you an email saying you\n\n200\n00:10:24.517 --> 00:10:28.801\nneed to update your account information,\nclick on this link.\n\n201\n00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.260\nNot that I can think of.\n\n202\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.760\nEven if they did, if I got an email from\nBank of America saying, hey, we need you\n\n203\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.640\nto update your information, here's\na link to click on to come to our site.\n\n204\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.610\nNegative, I'm gonna open up a browser\nseparate from my email client.\n\n205\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.741\nI'm gonna go to Bank of America,\nthe actual Bank of America and\n\n206\n00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:45.695\nI'm gonna log in.\n\n207\n00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:49.507\nIf it was that important, if they really\nneeded my information to be updated,\n\n208\n00:10:49.507 --> 00:10:52.859\nthere's gonna be a message from\nsomewhere in my account page letting\n\n209\n00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:55.086\nme know the exact same information, right?\n\n210\n00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:56.715\nSo do not click on stuff like that.\n\n211\n00:10:56.715 --> 00:10:58.455\nDon't even open those emails up.\n\n212\n00:10:58.455 --> 00:11:00.175\nThat's really about all it takes nowadays.\n\n213\n00:11:00.175 --> 00:11:02.565\n&gt;&gt; Well, Bank of America\ndoesn't need you to log in for\n\n214\n00:11:02.565 --> 00:11:05.195\nthem to be able to make\nchanges to your account.\n\n215\n00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:07.715\nThey are the administrators\nof said account.\n\n216\n00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:08.565\nThey don't need your help.\n\n217\n00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:12.195\nThey can just go and do whatever the want\nmanipulate it as the administrator.\n\n218\n00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:14.638\nThey're never, ever going to ask you for\nyour password.\n\n219\n00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:17.850\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't need your\npassword to reset your password.\n\n220\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.820\nIf you forget your password,\njust like any other system, you say, okay,\n\n221\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.630\nI forgot my password.\n\n222\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.720\nLet me prove who I am and\ncome up with a new password.\n\n223\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.730\nBut you don't get the old password.\n\n224\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.040\nYou don't need the old password.\n\n225\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.965\nWhere else was I going with that?\n\n226\n00:11:30.965 --> 00:11:36.360\nSQL injection, yeah, really comes\ndown to doing input validation.\n\n227\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.062\nMaking sure that anytime I'm\naccepting input on a web form or\n\n228\n00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:42.820\na webpage of any kind.\n\n229\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.314\nAny type of form,\nI wanna make sure I'm sanitizing that.\n\n230\n00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:52.339\nMaking sure that, do they need 256\ncharacters for a last name field?\n\n231\n00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:54.133\nMost likely not.\n\n232\n00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:58.380\nDo they need to use all those\ndifferent special characters?\n\n233\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.969\nMost likely not, right?\n\n234\n00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.392\nBecause those are gonna be\npart of my SQL commands.\n\n235\n00:12:03.392 --> 00:12:08.007\nAnd if I can put at symbols, and open and\nclosed parentheses, and dollar signs, and\n\n236\n00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:10.880\nthings like that,\nI can put in a SQL command.\n\n237\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.750\nIf you're gonna sanitize that and\nwipe all that out,\n\n238\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.550\nmy commands aren't gonna work, all right?\n\n239\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.775\nSo simple input validation can prevent\nSQL injections, for the most part.\n\n240\n00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:21.510\nCross-site scripting.\n\n241\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.220\nAgain, this is the problem with\nthe website, not the victim typically.\n\n242\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.000\nIt's not your browser.\n\n243\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.450\nYour browser's doing\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n244\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.990\nIt's interpreting the webpage,\n\n245\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.670\nexecuting code, if necessary,\nto create that dynamic content.\n\n246\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.198\nYour browser doesn't know that it trusts\nthe server that you've connected to.\n\n247\n00:12:37.198 --> 00:12:40.349\nWhen you visit that webpage,\nit's establishing a trust there.\n\n248\n00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:43.310\nAnd that's what the cross-site\nscripting is taking advantage of.\n\n249\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.280\nYour browser doesn't know that this\nis malicious code coming down,\n\n250\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.140\nthat it's not what was intended for you\nto receive when you went to that webpage.\n\n251\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.992\nSo this falls on the website proprietary,\nthe ones that write the code there,\n\n252\n00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:57.724\nmaking sure that that\nweb server is secure.\n\n253\n00:12:57.724 --> 00:13:01.569\nSession hijacking,\nman in the middle attacks, encryption.\n\n254\n00:13:01.569 --> 00:13:06.342\nTrying to use good, strong\nidentification methods using protocols\n\n255\n00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:09.644\nthat randomize things\nlike sequence numbers.\n\n256\n00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:12.058\nAny of that can help with those\nman in the middle attacks.\n\n257\n00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.380\nEncryption is a big part of that.\n\n258\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.140\nCredential reuse,\nvariety in your passwords.\n\n259\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.915\nIf I use the same password for everything,\nthen if you ever get my password\n\n260\n00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:26.931\nyou have my password to all my\nsites that I go to, not just one.\n\n261\n00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.594\nPassword managers can help with this.\n\n262\n00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:32.444\nBecause it's a lot to expect out\nof our end users to have long,\n\n263\n00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:35.566\nstrong passwords for\nevery single thing they do.\n\n264\n00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:37.771\nBecause everything we do\nnowadays requires a password.\n\n265\n00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:41.962\nSo using password managers, educating\nyour users how to come up with good,\n\n266\n00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:44.790\nstrong passwords and\nnot reuse them over and over.\n\n267\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.090\nAll right, they also call out\nthe Mitnick-Shimomura Attack.\n\n268\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.640\nThere's a lot to learn from that attack.\n\n269\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.331\nIf you're not familiar with it, Google it.\n\n270\n00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:59.656\nIt's a great story to read.\n\n271\n00:13:59.656 --> 00:14:06.061\nKevin Mitnick,, one of the first\nguys to get prosecuted for hacking.\n\n272\n00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:08.274\nFamous hacker here in the States.\n\n273\n00:14:08.274 --> 00:14:12.972\nOne of the attacks he did was against\na researcher by the name of, and\n\n274\n00:14:12.972 --> 00:14:16.200\nI always mispronounce his name, Shimomura?\n\n275\n00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.371\nWas able to compromise his system and\nfrom there compromise other systems,\n\n276\n00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:23.969\nget access to information that\nhe shouldn't have had access to.\n\n277\n00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:30.714\nAnd the techniques he used were\nspoofing and prediction, right?\n\n278\n00:14:30.714 --> 00:14:34.945\nHe was able to do some TCCP spoofing,\nor IP spoofing, I should say,\n\n279\n00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:39.647\nto make it look like he was coming from\na certain location that was allowed.\n\n280\n00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:45.094\nSo being able to forge the IP headers,\nand change that source IP address.\n\n281\n00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:49.391\nAlso being able to monitor traffic\nof legitimate connections,\n\n282\n00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:51.705\nlooking at the sequence numbers.\n\n283\n00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:54.693\nAnd realizing that there was\na pattern to those sequence numbers.\n\n284\n00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:58.089\nAnd being able to predict what\nthe next sequence number was.\n\n285\n00:14:58.089 --> 00:15:02.492\nAnd thereby, being able to inject his\nown data into that conversation and\n\n286\n00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:04.130\nbasically take over.\n\n287\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.750\nAnd then once he had rooted or\ntaken control over the one machine,\n\n288\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.034\nhe was able then to scan that machine,\ndo network analysis,\n\n289\n00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:18.677\nfigure out what machines that compromised\nmachine was connecting to, right?\n\n290\n00:15:18.677 --> 00:15:21.080\nSo, you compromise one and\nthen from there,\n\n291\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.270\ntake advantage of the fact that machine\nwas able to connect to other machines.\n\n292\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.110\nAnd just spread the attack that way.\n\n293\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.020\nSo there was some good things\nto learn from there that\n\n294\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.010\nwe can't trust our protocols.\n\n295\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.160\nWe have to make sure we're\nusing good strong protocols.\n\n296\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.274\nGosh, the list could go on and on, right?\n\n297\n00:15:39.274 --> 00:15:43.580\nMaking sure that internal addresses\naren't coming from outside.\n\n298\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.170\nA lot of this has been patched against.\n\n299\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.585\nWe know TCP now conflicts things\nwith the sequence numbers.\n\n300\n00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:51.535\nSo it's not just, hey,\n\n301\n00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:55.145\nhere's packet one, then comes packet two,\nthen comes packet three.\n\n302\n00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:56.225\nThat'd be a little easy.\n\n303\n00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.479\nAnd even then it wasn't like that,\nit wasn't one, two,\n\n304\n00:15:58.479 --> 00:16:00.191\nthree when Mitnick performed this attack.\n\n305\n00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:05.556\nBut it was a repeatable pattern\nthat he was able to discern.\n\n306\n00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:10.567\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly, Shimomura actually\nhelped the FBI capture Kevin Mitnick.\n\n307\n00:16:10.567 --> 00:16:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz he was a security guy,\nor computer security guy.\n\n308\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.080\nAnd so it was I think a battle of the-\n&gt;&gt; Of the brains?\n\n309\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.660\n&gt;&gt; Of the brains and the egos there,\nit's like, wait, no, no, no.\n\n310\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.930\nSo a lot of interesting stuff\nwe can learn from that.\n\n311\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.360\nAnd really that's with all attacks, right?\n\n312\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.430\nWe'll talk later about lessons learned,\nand how important it is to go back after\n\n313\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.960\nthe fact and analyze so\nthat we can learn from our mistakes.\n\n314\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.010\nAnd hopefully not have the same\nthing happen over and over again.\n\n315\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.820\nThey also call out network mapping and\nscanning.\n\n316\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.866\nWe can't stress enough\nthe importance of baselines and\n\n317\n00:16:47.866 --> 00:16:52.099\nunderstanding what devices you have on\nyour network, what should be there.\n\n318\n00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:54.195\nSo that you know what shouldn't be there,\nor\n\n319\n00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:57.160\nyou can easily discern\nwhat shouldn't be there.\n\n320\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.740\nIf I know what was supposed to\nbe there in the first place.\n\n321\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.020\nSo, some common tools we\nuse to do network mapping.\n\n322\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.560\nNmap is the first one that pops into\nmy mind, cuz with that we can do scans.\n\n323\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.620\nWe can do a ping sweep, or\na couple other types of sweeps to look for\n\n324\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.790\nlive hosts and devices on the network.\n\n325\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.650\nCain and Abel,\none that I think I've used for\n\n326\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.970\nsome password cracking\nexercises maybe in this show or\n\n327\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.440\nother shows, is another one that does\na lot more than password cracking.\n\n328\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.250\nAnd it'll scan the network,\nand you'll start picking up.\n\n329\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.720\nOne of the ones it does is looking\nat ARP requests and ARP broadcasts.\n\n330\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.460\nAnd from that we can learn\nMac to IP address mappings,\n\n331\n00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.210\nas well as just determine what\nhosts are out there, right?\n\n332\n00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.620\nIt has to be a live host if it's\ncoming out with an ARP request.\n\n333\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.510\nSolarWinds makes some products.\n\n334\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.210\nThere are several products that are paid,\nthere are several that are free.\n\n335\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.680\nAgain, these are just tools that will\ngo out, sweep your network, looking for\n\n336\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.860\nlive hosts.\n\n337\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.100\nSome of the fancier ones,\nlike SolarWinds and\n\n338\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.290\nsome of the paid programs,\nthey can make a very nice diagram for you.\n\n339\n00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.686\nOthers like Nmap, it's text based and\nyou're gonna have to use that information\n\n340\n00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:09.910\nto kinda draw out your own\ndiagram if you need a visual.\n\n341\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.640\nSome of the information we look for\n\n342\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.620\nwhen we're doing network maps,\nwhere do we get this information?\n\n343\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.720\nWell, as I said, we can do ping sweeps,\nthat's one of the easiest ways to look for\n\n344\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.120\nlive hosts, but looking for your DHCP.\n\n345\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.240\nIf I go to a network, and\nI set my laptop here,\n\n346\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.120\nlet's say I can connect to your network\nand I set my laptop to be a DHCP client.\n\n347\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.180\nYour DHCP server most likely\nis gonna respond to me, and\n\n348\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.340\nI can gain information from that.\n\n349\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.280\nYou're like, well what, yeah,\nyou get an IP address, big whoop.\n\n350\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.080\nWell, I now know my IP,\nI've gotten a valid IP address.\n\n351\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.030\nI've got a subnet mask, so I can\ndetermine what your network address is.\n\n352\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.040\nSo now I know what at least\none of your subnets are.\n\n353\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.412\nMost likely passing out with that DHCP\ninformation is a default gateway, right?\n\n354\n00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:01.764\nSo I know the way off of\nthis particular subnet, so\n\n355\n00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:04.460\nI can start branching out into\nother subnets from there.\n\n356\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.780\nI've probably also got a DNS server's IP\naddress with that DHCP configuration.\n\n357\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.240\nSo now I know the IP\naddress of your DNS server,\n\n358\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.080\nwhich leads me to more information, right?\n\n359\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.790\nWhat can we get from DNS?\n\n360\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.134\nWell, if I can do a zone\ntransfer that would be the-\n\n361\n00:19:20.134 --> 00:19:21.750\n&gt;&gt; Game over [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's the pot of gold at\nthe end of the rainbow, right?\n\n363\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.990\nRemember, with DNS a zone transfer's\nhow DNS servers replicate\n\n364\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.270\ntheir zone file information.\n\n365\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.500\nAll of their named IP address mappings,\nSRV records,\n\n366\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.590\nreverse lookup records,\nall that's stored in a zone file.\n\n367\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.190\nAnd then zone transfers are how they\nreplicate from one DNS server to another.\n\n368\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.660\nAnd if your DNS server's\nset up improperly,\n\n369\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.710\nthen I could potentially request a zone\ntransfer right to my client machine and\n\n370\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.270\nhave a mapping of every\ndevice in your network.\n\n371\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.130\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n372\n00:19:53.098 --> 00:19:56.350\nEven without actually\ngetting the zone transfer,\n\n373\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.570\nI can use tools like nslookup that's built\ninto Windows to query your DNS server,\n\n374\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.210\nbecause that's what it does, right?\n\n375\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.320\nDNS is supposed to respond to these\nqueries, so we have to let it do that.\n\n376\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.040\nBut I can start hitting it for\nSRV records.\n\n377\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.178\nI can change my type in my nslookup\ncommands to SRV or SOA, right?\n\n378\n00:20:15.178 --> 00:20:17.949\nGet those service records or\nthe service locator records.\n\n379\n00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:22.177\nI can figure out which machines are\noffering what services, and that's golden\n\n380\n00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:26.212\nas well, cuz I can find your exchange\nservers, I can find your DNS servers,\n\n381\n00:20:26.212 --> 00:20:30.080\nI can find your domain controllers\nfrom that information.\n\n382\n00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.511\nWe can look at, gosh, what else?\n\n383\n00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:38.330\nThere's a ton of information\navailable in DNS.\n\n384\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.590\nSniffing network traffic,\njust watching the traffic go by.\n\n385\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.268\nI can see, in those packets,\nsource and destination IP addresses.\n\n386\n00:20:45.268 --> 00:20:52.170\nI can start to learn what devices are out\nthere, valid addresses, valid host names.\n\n387\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.210\nVLAN IDs are gonna be in the header of\nthat packet, I can start picking those up.\n\n388\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.310\nAnd I'm using all this information\nto map out your network, right?\n\n389\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.980\nAnd none of these on there own\nreally give me everything I need.\n\n390\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.080\nBut if I start taking all of this and\n\n391\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.020\nputting it together, the big picture\nstarts coming into focus, right?\n\n392\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.430\nAnd all of a sudden the pieces\nstart to fit together and\n\n393\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.430\nwe can make that big picture.\n\n394\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:16.190\nDomain names,\n\n395\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.650\nI can get that out of sniffing traffic,\nARP broadcasts I already mentioned.\n\n396\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.030\nNet view,\na simple command built into Windows.\n\n397\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.150\nI can start enumerating Windows\ndevices on the network,\n\n398\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.700\nshares that are located on the network,\ntrace route.\n\n399\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.090\nOnce I've learned about different subnets,\n\n400\n00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.680\nwe can start doing trace routes to other\nservers, try to map out your network as\n\n401\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.176\nfar as what subnets exist,\nping scans, port scans, right?\n\n402\n00:21:44.176 --> 00:21:46.310\nPing scans to find live hosts,\n\n403\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.360\nport scans to figure out what services are\npotentially running on those live hosts.\n\n404\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.920\nSo lots of different ways\nto gain information and\n\n405\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.480\nstart mapping out the network.\n\n406\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.820\nThis is what the bad guys are doing,\nso you should be doing it first.\n\n407\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.050\nYou should see what information\nyour network is exposing\n\n408\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.950\nto common techniques like this.\n\n409\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.650\nMaybe you can do something about it,\nmaybe we can mitigate some of that or\n\n410\n00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.710\nreduce the amount of information\nthat we're giving up by simply\n\n411\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.880\ndoing network scans and\njust doing that basic enumeration.\n\n412\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.617\nViruses and malicious code is something\nelse they're gonna call out in this\n\n413\n00:22:24.617 --> 00:22:26.123\nparticular objective.\n\n414\n00:22:26.123 --> 00:22:29.160\nAnd we've kind of gone over it,\nwe've talked about common techniques.\n\n415\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.560\nWe've we've mentioned\na few of these terms,\n\n416\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.918\nbut let's break down some of the different\ntypes so that we are familiar with that.\n\n417\n00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:39.410\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, we talked about malware\nearlier, what about the specifics?\n\n418\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.770\nI mean, we hinted at what malware was, but\n\n419\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.130\nthere are some concrete types of malware\nthat we're probably gonna run into.\n\n420\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.470\nCan you kind of walk us through those and\nthe differences in them?\n\n421\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n422\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.200\nAnd this is a place you see\na lot of misuse of these terms,\n\n423\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.920\nwhich sometimes doesn't make a difference,\n\n424\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.830\nother times it can be a big difference\nin what you're trying to do.\n\n425\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.390\nSo let's talk about that,\nwe talk about viruses, right?\n\n426\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:09.740\nA virus is a type of malware that attaches\nto files and/or programs, and when those\n\n427\n00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.420\nfiles or programs are either run or loaded\nup in a memory, the virus gets executed.\n\n428\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.820\nThen it'll typically spread\nto other documents or\n\n429\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.450\napplications that you have\nloaded up into memory.\n\n430\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.750\nAnd then I start sharing those files,\nand another computer,\n\n431\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.490\nwhoever opens those files,\nthe virus then loads up into their memory.\n\n432\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.300\nAnd it can infect files from there,\nand it starts to spread.\n\n433\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.070\nSo we'll say that viruses typically\nattach to files or programs.\n\n434\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.000\nThey're not standalone, is my point here.\n\n435\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.270\nA lot of them are memory resident,\nlike I said.\n\n436\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.890\nThey'll load up in a memory and\nthen anything I open up or\n\n437\n00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.310\ndump in the memory is gonna get infected.\n\n438\n00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.914\nThere could be polymorphic viruses,\n\n439\n00:23:49.914 --> 00:23:54.071\nviruses that change every time\nthey are spread or executed.\n\n440\n00:23:54.071 --> 00:23:57.100\nMake them extremely difficult to detect,\n\n441\n00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.475\nbecause they're not gonna match\nby definitions anymore that\n\n442\n00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:06.201\nmy typical antivirus software\nrelies on to detect those viruses.\n\n443\n00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:09.681\n&gt;&gt; It's like the sentinels in the X-Men\nmovie right, where the ones in the future,\n\n444\n00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:12.920\nwhere they would use some power against\nthem and they would learn and adapt.\n\n445\n00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.750\nThey would kill one and then the others\nwould learn against that, and\n\n446\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.770\nchange so their attacks weren't working\nas well to defend against them.\n\n447\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's brilliant\nhonestly when you look at it.\n\n448\n00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like wait you're telling me this\n\n449\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.280\nvirus can actually rewrite its own code,\nso\n\n450\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.530\nthat it no longer matches its definition.\n\n451\n00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.250\nThe smart people.\n\n452\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.370\n&gt;&gt; That's impressive stuff.\n\n453\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.170\nIf you could be impressed\nby that kind of thing.\n\n454\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.310\n&gt;&gt; I can. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Which you can,\nI don't agree with what they're doing with\n\n455\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.260\nit, but the fact that they've got\nit done is pretty impressive.\n\n456\n00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:43.360\nBoot sector viruses, these are going to\nload up in the boot areas of our systems,\n\n457\n00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.220\nwhether that's removable media type\nboot sector, like a autorun locations\n\n458\n00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.870\non USBs or boot sectors of operating\nsystems we can infect that.\n\n459\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.360\nTypically leads to root kits which\nwe'll come back to in a minute.\n\n460\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.610\nThe viruses could be stealth viruses,\nwhere they hide themselves from\n\n461\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.820\nyou know, from say process lists,\nthings like that.\n\n462\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.940\nMacro viruses, a kind of virus that\nattaches specifically to alpha stock even.\n\n463\n00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.300\nSo anything that supports macros,\nwhich is a lot, right?\n\n464\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.260\nWe've got all of our Office applications,\nand\n\n465\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.610\nthen some of our open-source\napplications as well.\n\n466\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.160\nThat are designed to be compatible with,\nall of a sudden,\n\n467\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.850\nthose macros can go from system to system.\n\n468\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.360\nAgain, not without our help.\n\n469\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.510\nI have to have a macro\nvirus infected file,\n\n470\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.390\nthat I would transfer to somebody and\nthen they would get infected from that.\n\n471\n00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.540\nAnd the reason I stress that is because\nthat is the real big difference between\n\n472\n00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.600\nviruses, and worms,\nwhereas viruses need our help to spread,\n\n473\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.470\nthey will say viruses are\nself-replicating, but it's tricky concept,\n\n474\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.300\nthey do if I have an infected\ndocument in memory and\n\n475\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.310\nI open up other infected document,\nthey can spread from one to the other.\n\n476\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.410\nSo self-replicating in the fact\nthat they can go from one file or\n\n477\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.550\nprogram to another, but\nnot from system to system typically.\n\n478\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.590\nI have to spread that.\n\n479\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.260\nI have to put that up in a share,\n\n480\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.290\nsomebody has to download it\nwhere as worms are stand alone.\n\n481\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.000\nThese guys don't attach themselves\nto any file or program,\n\n482\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.240\nthey're their own executable.\n\n483\n00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.620\nAnd so they truly are self replicating and\n\n484\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.460\nthey can be very damaging just in\nthe amount of replication traffic\n\n485\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.520\nthat that they can generate\ncan be damaging, right?\n\n486\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.690\nWhen we talk about something\nlike pulling up stats for\n\n487\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:31.187\nSQL Sapphire Slammer worm,\ndoubled every 8.5 seconds.\n\n488\n00:26:31.187 --> 00:26:34.224\nOver 90% of vulnerable hosts were\ninfected within ten minutes.\n\n489\n00:26:35.675 --> 00:26:36.815\nTen minutes.\n\n490\n00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:37.625\n&gt;&gt; That's impressive.\n\n491\n00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:39.945\n&gt;&gt; And it spread around the world.\n\n492\n00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:44.025\nGo look at one of the heat maps or\nwhere it shows the red dots that expand.\n\n493\n00:26:44.025 --> 00:26:48.732\nI mean within ten minutes it's covering\neverything but the Antarctic, and\n\n494\n00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:49.652\nthe Sahara Desert.\n\n495\n00:26:49.652 --> 00:26:50.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean where there's no\n\n496\n00:26:50.812 --> 00:26:52.002\ncomputers, right?\n\n497\n00:26:52.002 --> 00:26:54.592\nSo it's really really impressive.\n\n498\n00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:58.102\nWe've got SQL in one of our networks that\nI worked at and it shut the network down.\n\n499\n00:26:58.102 --> 00:27:01.462\nNot because it was doing anything\nbad to the computer per se, but\n\n500\n00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:03.792\nthe replication traffic\nshut the network down.\n\n501\n00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:05.622\nWe could not remote in to anything,\n\n502\n00:27:05.622 --> 00:27:08.332\nwe couldn't connect to anything,\nbecause there was just so much traffic.\n\n503\n00:27:08.332 --> 00:27:11.552\nYou just have to start shutting systems\ndown, find the infected ones and go.\n\n504\n00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.580\nSo worms again, like viruses but\nthey are self-replicating stand alone.\n\n505\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.370\nMakes worms easier to find and\neradicate, because they're stand alone.\n\n506\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.630\nWhereas viruses much more\ndifficult to find and\n\n507\n00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.130\neradicate because you have to be\nsure which files are infected.\n\n508\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.450\nYou think you cleaned them, you reboot\nthe system, you open up a file and\n\n509\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:37.230\nit's infected all over again because you\nmissed one of the infected documents.\n\n510\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.280\nSo just one of the differences\nthere between viruses and\n\n511\n00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.750\nworms and Daniel I know you are giving me\nthat signal I've got a lot more to go so\n\n512\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.250\nI guess it's time to cut me off [LAUGH].\n\n513\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Great, he was giving you one of the-\n&gt;&gt; He was giving me the sign.\n\n514\n00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.845\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] time ticking away.\n\n515\n00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:53.592\nHe's right it is.\n\n516\n00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:56.520\nWe got a little time left in this episode.\n\n517\n00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.940\nSo I'm giving him the, it's time to\ntake a break little sign there, but\n\n518\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.140\nwe will come back, don't worry,\nguys, we're going to finish this out,\n\n519\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.190\nwe've got a bit more to go through for you\nguys so that you understand, obviously,\n\n520\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.230\nwe're going to finish up what malware is,\nthe different viruses for it,\n\n521\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.060\nand so on and so forth.\n\n522\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.925\nMike, I know you've got other things\nthat you wanna show us as well.\n\n523\n00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Look forward\n\n524\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.160\nto seeing you in that episode\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we are going to do.\n\n525\n00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.980\nThank you guys for joining us in part one,\nlooking forward to part two,\n\n526\n00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.125\njoin us there as for\nthis episode we are go ahead and sign off.\n\n527\n00:28:24.125 --> 00:28:25.880\nFor ITPro TV,\nI have been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n528\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.140\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.245\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:12.163\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.151\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:16.740\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.302\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:22.202\nAnd in today's episode we\nare coming back at you with more of\n\n9\n00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.780\nour GIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.500\nAnd joining us in the studio\nis the master blaster himself,\n\n11\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.870\nthat's right, he runs Border Town,\nour good friend Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.046\nMike, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:36.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doing good, nice reference here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:38.140\nAll right, I'm doing great.\n\n15\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.100\nAs we left off, part one we kinda ended\n\n16\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.310\nabruptly there going through different\ntypes of viruses and malicious code.\n\n17\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.370\nSo let's just jump right back in and\ncontinue on So\n\n18\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.480\nwe can make it through\nthis extensive list.\n\n19\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.340\nWe talked about viruses,\nwe talked about worms.\n\n20\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.634\nWe differentiated between the two.\n\n21\n00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:58.720\nNext thing I wanna talk about is\nsomething called a Trojan Horse.\n\n22\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.521\nAnd you guys can go back and if you\nknow your history with the Trojans and\n\n23\n00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.429\nthe Greeks,\nwe have an idea of what a Trojan Horse is.\n\n24\n00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.662\nAnd when it comes to computers, and\n\n25\n00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:12.290\nour information security Trojan Horse\nis exactly the same thing.\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.640\nIt's something that's gonna look\nlike something you want, but\n\n27\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200\ninstead it has a payload of something\nyou definitely don't want right.\n\n28\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.240\nIt's something that's bad wrapped up\ninside something that looks really good.\n\n29\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.380\nIn other words maybe you, I don't know.\n\n30\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.070\nDownload a little game.\n\n31\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.720\nAnd that game plays,\nbut in the background,\n\n32\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.993\nthat game is installing some malware and\nopening up a back door, right?\n\n33\n00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:39.288\nThat's calling home.\n\n34\n00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:41.620\nAnd now somebody has remote\naccess to your system.\n\n35\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.283\nSo that's the idea behind a Trojan horse.\n\n36\n00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:48.157\nIt's just something that masquerades or\nappears as something that you want.\n\n37\n00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:51.360\nBut inside it, the actual payload\nis something you don't want.\n\n38\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.580\nThis is a very, very common technique\nto use to get back doors installed is\n\n39\n00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.960\nwhere we usually see this.\n\n40\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.578\n&gt;&gt; Fun to prank your friends with-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely\n\n41\n00:01:58.578 --> 00:01:59.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:00.383\n&gt;&gt; For good time, good time.\n\n43\n00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:06.120\nIt can be a lot of fun when used in places\nthat you have permissions to do this.\n\n44\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.412\nBut yeah I need to get some software\nloaded up onto your system some tools that\n\n45\n00:02:10.412 --> 00:02:11.540\nI wanna use.\n\n46\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.570\nLike I said that back that gonna\nallow me access to your system.\n\n47\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.830\nSo, and I need you execute it.\n\n48\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.723\nWell if I send you\nhacker tools most likely\n\n49\n00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:23.700\nI'd say 80% of you are not\ngonna click on it.\n\n50\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.335\n20% of will,\nI'm not saying you guys watching, but\n\n51\n00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.365\nI know there are people out\nthere that will click on it.\n\n52\n00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:29.836\nBut most likely not.\n\n53\n00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:32.520\nSo I need to make it look like\nsomething that you wanna click on.\n\n54\n00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.345\nLike hey here's a free game of tetris, who\ncan resist a good game of tetris right?\n\n55\n00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.530\nAnd you click on it and\ntetris actually runs.\n\n56\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.610\nI mean it has to do something to make it\nlook like hey, this is what I wanted.\n\n57\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.050\nAnd hopefully you don't notice all the\nother activity going on in the background,\n\n58\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.640\nthings installing, doing whatever it is.\n\n59\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.877\nSo that's the idea behind a Trojan Horse.\n\n60\n00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:57.403\nSpyware, adware, these are some terms\nthat we see in the news all the time,\n\n61\n00:02:57.403 --> 00:03:01.580\nwe probably hear about Spyware is\nmalware that's going to capture and\n\n62\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.089\nsend your information to somebody else.\n\n63\n00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:05.494\nIt's going to spy on you.\n\n64\n00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:07.500\nHence the name spyware.\n\n65\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470\nSo it can be capturing credentials.\n\n66\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.323\nIt could be scanning through emails.\n\n67\n00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:15.225\nThey could be gathering up screenshots,\nany number of things.\n\n68\n00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:18.352\nKeystrokes, I mean all of that\nwould be considered spyware.\n\n69\n00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.933\nAnd the idea is it's going\nto send it off somewhere.\n\n70\n00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.685\nIt's either gonna send it off through\nmaybe a remote connection that it\n\n71\n00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:28.375\nestablishes, or it stores it and\nsomebody has to physically come in and\n\n72\n00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.755\nretrieve it like some keystroke\nloggers that are hardware based.\n\n73\n00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:34.450\nMight be something I slip in\nthe back of your computer.\n\n74\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.660\nI unplug your keyboard, I plug this in,\nI plug the keyboard back into it, and\n\n75\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.030\nit captures all your keystrokes.\n\n76\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.444\nIt has a certain amount of memory.\n\n77\n00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:44.799\nNext day when you're not looking I\ncome in I slip that thing out and\n\n78\n00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.959\nI have a record of everything you've\ntyped including user names and passwords.\n\n79\n00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.929\nCredit card numbers,\nwhatever you've typed that day.\n\n80\n00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.020\nSo that's spyware.\n\n81\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.550\nAdware typically just displays banners or\npop ups, it can be very, very annoying.\n\n82\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.440\nAnd they go well why is that\nincluded with this kind of thing?\n\n83\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.962\nIt's not harmful.\n\n84\n00:04:02.962 --> 00:04:07.512\nWell, it can be, right, because if we're\nburning man hours, if my users aren't\n\n85\n00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:11.867\nbeing productive, they're not making\nmy company any money, they're unable\n\n86\n00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:16.554\nto work because there's a constant barrage\nof banner ads popping up on their screen.\n\n87\n00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:19.320\nI have to get somebody to clean that up.\n\n88\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.241\nThis person's without a system,\nwe have to give them loaner systems.\n\n89\n00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.400\nSo it definitely eats into our resources.\n\n90\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, plus it's typically not just,\nthere's an ad for\n\n91\n00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:31.470\ne-cigarettes, or whatever.\n\n92\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.050\nOkay, yeah, that's annoying and\nI click it, it goes away.\n\n93\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.470\nIt is a barrage of with adware,\n\n94\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.900\nit is inundating your system and\nwhat does that do?\n\n95\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.320\nIt starts hogging resources\nto put the banners up.\n\n96\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.817\nYou can't go anywhere,\nyou can't do anything.\n\n97\n00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:48.712\nAnd then that whole productivity thing\nstarts really dropping to the floor and\n\n98\n00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:52.502\nyou gotta call somebody to come and\nclean up your PC which costs money right?\n\n99\n00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:55.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so it's just resource intensive.\n\n100\n00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.918\nAnd can cause a lot of aggravation and\n\n101\n00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:59.110\neven a couple of dollars\nyou gotta throw at us.\n\n102\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.910\nSo just because all it does\nis throw an ad at you,\n\n103\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.540\ndon't think that it's not damaging\nyour system or your company.\n\n104\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like spam in general, right?\n\n105\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.685\nIt's not a bad bad thing.\n\n106\n00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:10.455\nIt's just an email in my message box.\n\n107\n00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:14.225\nBut a lot of times that's the precursor\nto an attack and just the amount of money\n\n108\n00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:19.725\nthat we spend trying to\ncontrol spam is mind boggling.\n\n109\n00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.083\nIf you ever do any research into it,\nit is amazing.\n\n110\n00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:25.897\nAnd heck, the majority of\nthe traffic on the Internet or\n\n111\n00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:27.937\nin your mail at least is spam.\n\n112\n00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:32.270\nIt's crazy to think that if we got rid of\nspam, we'd free up 70% of our resources.\n\n113\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.183\nIt's like, holy smokes,\nthat's a lot of spam.\n\n114\n00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:38.260\nWhat else we wanna talk about?\n\n115\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.310\nRoot kits.\n\n116\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.243\nNasty, nasty creatures here.\n\n117\n00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:41.027\n&gt;&gt; They're the devil.\n\n118\n00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:43.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah the devil, I like it.\n\n119\n00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:51.320\nRoot kits is malware that gets way\ndown low in your system right?\n\n120\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.750\nHow low can you go?\n\n121\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.170\nThis thing goes all the way down.\n\n122\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.120\nIt basically gets in between\nour system and the user.\n\n123\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.509\nWhen we look at our rings and\nthe way computing works, and\n\n124\n00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.544\nwhat that means is it can\nintercept any calls that,\n\n125\n00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:10.306\nwe make from that user area to the system,\nit's in between us.\n\n126\n00:06:10.306 --> 00:06:11.730\nSo it can intercept those.\n\n127\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.090\nAnd it can return results that are fake,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.442\nIn other words, when I, if there's\nrootkit on my system, I go and I look and\n\n129\n00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:22.650\nmy processes in Task Manager\ndoesn't show up in there.\n\n130\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.450\nIt's hiding it.\n\n131\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.310\nIt doesn't see anything.\n\n132\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.209\nIf I do a netset an, I don't see the port\nthat it's listening on because it's\n\n133\n00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.290\nintercepting my calls and\nreturning only what it wants me to see.\n\n134\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.680\nSo they can be extremely\ndifficult to get rid of.\n\n135\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.520\nBut at this point, they have root\nlevel access to your system.\n\n136\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.337\nThey can do anything\nthey want to that system.\n\n137\n00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:46.506\nWhether that's to spy on you,\nwhether that's starting to remove data,\n\n138\n00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:49.960\nexfiltrate data format,\nwhatever it is that they wanna do.\n\n139\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.160\nRootkits are nasty, nasty things, and\n\n140\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.050\nonce you get one,\nthey're near are impossible to get rid of.\n\n141\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.056\nYou can try and try, and\nsometimes you clean them up.\n\n142\n00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:02.316\nBut it's really hard to tell what's\nbeen infected and what hasn't,\n\n143\n00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:05.368\nbecause that's what the rootkit does,\nit hides itself so well.\n\n144\n00:07:05.368 --> 00:07:09.141\nSo typically it's reformat, and\njust blow the system away, and\n\n145\n00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.030\nhopefully you have a current backup,\nall right.\n\n146\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Even then, with a backup, you have\nto know when you got the rootkit cuz\n\n147\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.093\nyou may have been backing the rootkit up.\n\n148\n00:07:17.093 --> 00:07:18.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like,\n\n149\n00:07:18.757 --> 00:07:22.350\nthis is not good it really\nis a pretty bad day.\n\n150\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.033\n&gt;&gt; It is they're very very difficult\nto detect and to get rid off.\n\n151\n00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:33.500\nActiveX or Active Content I should say\nin general is another big attack vector.\n\n152\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.410\nWhere we're gonna have to deal with\nvirus and malware, or malicious codes.\n\n153\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.253\nAnything that's running scripts,\nActiveX is a big one,\n\n154\n00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:46.285\nJava is another one that we use Used to\nprovide dynamic content on web pages.\n\n155\n00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:51.199\nWell if it's executing codes, so\nnow if I can slip in some malicious code,\n\n156\n00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.467\nyour browser is gonna execute it.\n\n157\n00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:58.838\nJava's a little bit safer than ActiveX\nbecause it does Sandbox everything.\n\n158\n00:07:58.838 --> 00:08:04.370\nDoesn't mean that we can't escape that\nJava Sandbox and actually do some harm.\n\n159\n00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.170\nBut it's a little better than ActiveX.\n\n160\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.270\nActiveX has access to Windows,\nsystem commands basically.\n\n161\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.245\nAccess to the system.\n\n162\n00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:13.790\nIt can look at file systems and\nthings like that.\n\n163\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.560\nAnd so it's very powerful, and\nit can lead to some big trouble.\n\n164\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.380\nSo any type of active content\nwe do have to be careful with.\n\n165\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.240\nThey also mention zombies and botnets.\n\n166\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.750\nA zombie is a machine\nthat's been compromised,\n\n167\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.050\nthat I'm gonna try to use in an attack.\n\n168\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.350\nWe think of zombies brainless,\ndon't know what to do,\n\n169\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.300\nthey need something to\ntell them what to do.\n\n170\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.110\nThat's the idea.\n\n171\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.930\nAnd what bad guys do,\nwe talked about denial of service.\n\n172\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.540\nWe talked about distributed\ndenial of service.\n\n173\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.790\nNow, if I'm trying to do an attack, me as\none computer attacking some major service\n\n174\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.670\nprovider on the Internet, there's no way,\nI don't have enough resources to do that.\n\n175\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.320\nI'm going to run out of bandwidth\nbefore I'm able to denial of service\n\n176\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.290\nthis big company.\n\n177\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.600\nCuz they have server farms,\nand huge pipes coming in.\n\n178\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.760\nSo I'm going to recruit\na bunch of zombies.\n\n179\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.990\nWhat that basically means is I'm going\nto spend my time compromising machines.\n\n180\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.420\nAnd those compromised machines,\nnothing bad's going to happen to them.\n\n181\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.830\nI'm going to not do anything other\nthan load up some code on there so\n\n182\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.260\nthat they now know where to listen.\n\n183\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.370\nLike say an IRC chat room or\nsomething like that.\n\n184\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.050\nAnd as soon as I get enough of these\nzombies, then I can launch my attack.\n\n185\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.390\nAnd through that IRC, I can send this\ncommand out to all the zombies, and\n\n186\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.860\nthey all attack at once.\n\n187\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.770\nSo the individual machine, the compromised\nmachine, is what they call the zombie.\n\n188\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.690\nThe whole team of zombies that\nI'm getting ready to use for\n\n189\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.229\nthis attack would be my botnet, all right?\n\n190\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.110\nIt's really scary to think you can\nactually go to certain places on the web\n\n191\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.420\nand you can rent botnets at this point.\n\n192\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.681\nI can say, hey, I need a botnet.\n\n193\n00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:58.420\nAll right, how many ndoes do you need?\n\n194\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.390\nA thousand.\nHow long do you need them for?\n\n195\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:00.980\nA couple hours.\n\n196\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.588\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this is what you've gotta pay,\nhere's your IP addresses or\n\n197\n00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:06.170\nhere's your channel you're gonna\nuse to communicate with them.\n\n198\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.410\nWell, how is that even possible?\n\n199\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.790\nThese bots, or the zombies I should say,\nthey're infected machines but\n\n200\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.250\nthey're not infected in a way that's\ngoing to be noticeable, right?\n\n201\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.020\nThey've got this malware on them.\n\n202\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.910\nAnd let's say,\ntake your office, for example.\n\n203\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.640\nIs your office 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week?\n\n204\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.584\nMost likely not, right?\n\n205\n00:10:23.584 --> 00:10:27.021\nYou're a nine to five, nine to eight\nbusiness, something like that.\n\n206\n00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:29.420\nWhat are those machines\ndoing all night long?\n\n207\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.720\nWell, if they're, they can be infected,\nand they can be turned into zombies.\n\n208\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.900\nAnd in the middle of the night when\nnobody's noticing what's going on, you've\n\n209\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.280\ngot all these corporate machines that\nare sitting there, idle, doing nothing.\n\n210\n00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.522\nThey come to life, and.\n\n211\n00:10:41.522 --> 00:10:44.640\nIt's like the Apocalypse, here come\nall the zombies coming at you, right?\n\n212\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.910\nSo, anyway, that's the idea behind trying\nto make it a little dramatic there.\n\n213\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.481\nYour zombies,\n&gt;&gt; You did a great job, Mike.\n\n214\n00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:54.539\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nThank you very much.\n\n215\n00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:56.040\nScareware.\n\n216\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.620\nScareware.\n\n217\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.730\nWe see a lot of this.\n\n218\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:05.050\nTypically this is things that try to scare\nyou into buying something or paying money.\n\n219\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.150\nThe most common one we see,\nthe XP Anti-Virus 2008,\n\n220\n00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.750\nI think it was, or something like that.\n\n221\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.180\nIt was a big one that went out.\n\n222\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.950\nYou get a pop up that says,\nhey, your machine is infected.\n\n223\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.905\nYou have over 4,372 viruses detected.\n\n224\n00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:23.860\nBy our software and\nwe can remove them all.\n\n225\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.050\nAnd so you click Buy Now, and it says\nhere put your credit card number in here!\n\n226\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.600\nYou put your credit card number in there,\nand lo and behold,\n\n227\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.040\nyou don't get any anti-virus software,\nyour credit card is billed, and\n\n228\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.430\nnow it's probably gonna be billed many,\n\n229\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.200\nmany times cuz they're gonna sell your\ncredit card number to other people.\n\n230\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.810\nAnd you weren't infected in the first\nplace, that's the idea behind scareware.\n\n231\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.490\nI know people that have fallen victim\nto this, that they didn't understand,\n\n232\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.830\ndidn't know what software they\nalready had on the system, end user,\n\n233\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.710\nI don't know what our antivirus\nsolution is at our organization.\n\n234\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.890\nI get this message,\nI'm trying to be helpful.\n\n235\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.420\nI think I'm doing the right thing.\n\n236\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.400\nMy gosh, I'm infected.\n\n237\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.810\n&gt;&gt; And man,\nthey made it look real legitimate.\n\n238\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.120\nI mean, the color schemes,\nfont types, you name it,\n\n239\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.110\nthey did a really good job\nof looking at the details\n\n240\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.940\nof something that looked like\nit might be a Microsoft product.\n\n241\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.650\nAnd that's why people were duped, because\nit looks legit and it's scaring you.\n\n242\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.030\nHey, my system, which looks legitimate,\nis telling me I've got a problem.\n\n243\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.640\nYeah, I should probably go ahead and\n\n244\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.090\npay the $20, or whatever it is, the $40\nthey asked for, and I'll get cleaned up.\n\n245\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.390\nI'm good to go.\n\n246\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.700\nI'm happy to do that.\n\n247\n00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.640\nAnd then, boom, you're stuck,\nyou're hooked, they got you.\n\n248\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.560\nAt least got $40 out of you for\nno good reason.\n\n249\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.950\nAnd even a worse case scenario,\n\n250\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.840\nthey're selling your credit\ncard numbers and you know.\n\n251\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.870\nIdentity theft and that kind of thing so.\n\n252\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nI'll tell you a story about my stepmother.\n\n253\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.380\nPlease don't get mad at me, Stepmom.\n\n254\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But she fell victim to this.\n\n255\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.270\nShe called me up and said, hey,\nlook, I think I might have a problem.\n\n256\n00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.020\nI thought my computer was infected.\n\n257\n00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.010\nI tried to buy this software, and\nI didn't get any software from it.\n\n258\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.730\nIt doesn't seem to have done anything.\n\n259\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.090\nI was like, did you put your\ncredit card number in there?\n\n260\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.270\nShe's like, yes.\n\n261\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.870\nAnd I said, hang up with me right now, and\n\n262\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.020\ncall the credit card company right now,\nand explain to them what happened.\n\n263\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.300\nTell them you think your\ncard's been compromised.\n\n264\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.650\nSo this was all within 15 minutes.\n\n265\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.430\nShe calls the credit card company.\n\n266\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.150\nThere were already fraudulent\ncharges on that card.\n\n267\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.820\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And that was within 15 minutes.\n\n268\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.460\nCrazy, right?\n\n269\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.780\nBut again, same like you were saying.\n\n270\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.950\nShe's not a computer person.\n\n271\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.680\nShe didn't,\n\n272\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.610\nit looked like legitimate pop up from her\nsystem, so she didn't know any better.\n\n273\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.435\nSo anyway, scareware.\n\n274\n00:13:39.435 --> 00:13:43.950\nRansomware, I've seen some people try to\nclassify this as a form of scareware.\n\n275\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.355\nI guess I can see that.\n\n276\n00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:47.945\nRansomeware-\n&gt;&gt; It'll scare you.\n\n277\n00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:50.755\n[LAUGH] It's scary, there's no doubt.\n\n278\n00:13:50.755 --> 00:13:52.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ask anybody\nthat's had to deal with it.\n\n279\n00:13:52.752 --> 00:13:55.620\nYour job's on the line-\n&gt;&gt; Can I retract my former statement about\n\n280\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.800\nrude kids being the devil?\n\n281\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.290\nIt's a lesser in for demon.\n\n282\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.770\nThis is the devil.\n\n283\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.300\n&gt;&gt; It is bad, right?\n\n284\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not good.\n\n285\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.590\n&gt;&gt; Ransomware, what it's going to do\nis it's going to infect your system and\n\n286\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.650\nit's going to encrypt files.\n\n287\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.820\nAnd then it's going to basically\nhold them hostage and say you pay\n\n288\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.670\nus this amount of money, or BitCoin,\nand we'll release your files to you.\n\n289\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.130\nNow what do you do, right?\n\n290\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.600\nI mean, you've got files that,\n\n291\n00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.240\nlet's say you're a small law firm and\nthey've encrypted all your case files.\n\n292\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.310\nI need those case files, I can't do my\njob, we can't perform, I've gotta go to\n\n293\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.660\ncourt tomorrow afternoon representing\na client, I can't get access to my files.\n\n294\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.900\nSo what do I do, right?\n\n295\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.260\nOdds are,\nyou probably try to pay the ransomware and\n\n296\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.755\nyou just keep your fingers crossed that\nyou actually get your document back.\n\n297\n00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.750\nI mean, these are not trustworthy\npeople we're dealing with right?\n\n298\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.640\nSo just because you pay the ransom,\n\n299\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.880\ndoes that guarantee you get\nthe decryption key to get you data back?\n\n300\n00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.470\n&gt;&gt; What's weird is there is,\nthis is a funny like sub-culture\n\n301\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.690\nof security because if you get hit with a\nransomware and someones telling you, okay,\n\n302\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.720\ngive me three or five BitCoin,\nwhatever it is they ask you for, and\n\n303\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.410\nyou pay, and\nthey don't release your data, right?\n\n304\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.450\nWell, you're gonna tell everybody and your\nbrother on forums and things like that,\n\n305\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.370\nyeah, I paid this guy who set\nransomeware and he didn't unlock me.\n\n306\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.750\nSo whatever you do, don't pay out, right?\n\n307\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.660\nSo he stops making money because\nhe's not releasing files.\n\n308\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.680\nSo they are motivated.\n\n309\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.190\nThe good news is they\nprobably will actually\n\n310\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.270\ngive you the key that you\nneed to unlock your files.\n\n311\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.970\nBut it came at a great expense and\nyou had to learn a lesson through that.\n\n312\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:35.470\nBut still, it does happen where the guy's\nlike I don't care, pay me more.\n\n313\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.950\nAnd they continue to try to bilk you for\nevery dollar they can get.\n\n314\n00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.330\nBut the good news is if you pay,\n\n315\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.830\na lot of the times they will\nactually release your stuff.\n\n316\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\ncuz they're business people, right?\n\n317\n00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.210\nThey understand that they want\nto continue to make money.\n\n318\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.909\nSo, it's a scary thing.\n\n319\n00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:54.809\nBut anyway, here we want to make\nsure we understand what that is.\n\n320\n00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:56.482\nWhat do you do about\nsomething like ransomware?\n\n321\n00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:57.764\nWell, you hope you have a good backup.\n\n322\n00:15:57.764 --> 00:15:58.655\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n323\n00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:02.059\nAnd that's the thing, if you're not\ngonna pay it, or if you pay it and\n\n324\n00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:05.730\nyou don't get your information released,\nthen you gotta go to a backup.\n\n325\n00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.090\nAnd now you've lost,\nif that backup was done yesterday morning,\n\n326\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:14.250\nthen I've lost over 24 hours'\nworth of data, potentially.\n\n327\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.980\nRansomware is one of the scarier\nthing that's out there and\n\n328\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.300\nit's growing exponentially.\n\n329\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.630\nThere's reports of companies\ngetting hit twice in the same day\n\n330\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.910\nby different ransomware.\n\n331\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.970\n&gt;&gt; That's when your loss expectancy\nalgorithms start coming into play.\n\n332\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, if I pay out ransomware,\n\n333\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.000\nhow much is it?\n\n334\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.700\nIf I didn't pay,\nhow much would we lose business wise?\n\n335\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.760\nIf I have a good back-up.\n\n336\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.540\nYou got to take all these into effect.\n\n337\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.500\nSo risk management really comes into play.\n\n338\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.040\nAs much as I hate risk management.\n\n339\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.685\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n&gt;&gt; It's boring but\n\n340\n00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:45.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.990\n&gt;&gt; Not my favorite topic.\n\n342\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.770\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n343\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:48.780\n&gt;&gt; All right what else we got.\n\n344\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.278\nWe talked about ransomware.\n\n345\n00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:53.120\nLogic bomb, if I threw this one in there,\nactually wasn't on the objectives,\n\n346\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.790\nbut heck, what conversation-\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n347\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Would be good without logic bombs.\n\n348\n00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.780\nBecause it is a type of malware, or\nmalicious code that we have to deal with.\n\n349\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.319\nIt's really,\na logic bomb is usually a virus\n\n350\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.000\nthat is going to only activate\nunder certain conditions.\n\n351\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.350\nSo there's some kind of logic\ninvolved in triggering this,\n\n352\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:19.110\nwhether that's a time of day,\nlike July 4th, 2020.\n\n353\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:24.760\nOr something like that, or\nI've got something that scans payroll and\n\n354\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.030\nif my name doesn't show on the payroll\nreport one week my virus goes to town.\n\n355\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.960\nRight?\nSo, I'm kind of doing, I'm just kidding.\n\n356\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.498\nI don't actually.\n\n357\n00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:35.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n358\n00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.651\nBut that's the idea behind the logic bomb.\n\n359\n00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:38.264\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nare you trying to tell us something here?\n\n360\n00:17:38.264 --> 00:17:38.803\n[LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:17:38.803 --> 00:17:39.529\n&gt;&gt; Don't fire me.\n\n362\n00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:40.068\n[LAUGH].\n\n363\n00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:40.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.000\nThat's the idea behind a logic bomb.\n\n365\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.700\nJust kinda logical trigger\ndoesn't execute immediately.\n\n366\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.550\nWe see a lot these even in\njust normal viruses and\n\n367\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.190\nworms, just to give it\na little bit of a delay.\n\n368\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.799\nBecause if I'm going to propagate a virus,\nI don't want the first person I\n\n369\n00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:02.349\ninfect to see it, report it,\nsend it off to the anti-virus department.\n\n370\n00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:05.693\nCompanies have them write a definition and\nthat's the end of that,\n\n371\n00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.697\nI didn't get to infect too many people.\n\n372\n00:18:07.697 --> 00:18:11.570\nSo a lot of them put those\nkind of delays in that anyway.\n\n373\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:16.138\nVirus hoaxes are another one, I know you\nare like what do you mean a virus hoax?\n\n374\n00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:20.344\nI send out an email that says,\nhey, you are infected,\n\n375\n00:18:20.344 --> 00:18:26.106\nif you open up your file explorer and\nyou go in to SQL in Windows system 32,\n\n376\n00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:30.536\nif you see something called-\n&gt;&gt; CMD.ESC.\n\n377\n00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:34.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah delete or something I don't know\nyou can come up with many many different\n\n378\n00:18:34.578 --> 00:18:38.050\nscenarios and even if it doesn't\nend up doing any damage.\n\n379\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.920\nIt can kill productivity.\n\n380\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.880\nYou can flood email servers, because now\nall of sudden that user is trying to\n\n381\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.130\nwarn everybody else about this\npotential compromise of the system.\n\n382\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.630\nIt takes man hours to investigate it,\ndo our incident response,\n\n383\n00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.500\ndo our investigation to determine\nwhether or not you're actually infected.\n\n384\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.940\nVirus hoaxes can be damaging as well.\n\n385\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.480\nAll right last thing I promise I wanna\ntalk about I know I'm dragging this out.\n\n386\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.690\nInformation warfare, we're going to talk\nabout different types of information\n\n387\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.740\nwarfare that we're seeing nowadays.\n\n388\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.193\nFirst one I wanna mention is\nadvanced persistent threat, or APT.\n\n389\n00:19:14.193 --> 00:19:19.283\nAnd this is a new term relatively\nnew term that we're hearing.\n\n390\n00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:24.327\nAnd a relatively new concept, and what it\nstems from is the fact that what we're\n\n391\n00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:30.200\nfinding is a lot of these organizations\nare compromised for long periods of time.\n\n392\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.960\nBy the time you see an attack, or you\nrealize that data is being exfiltrated.\n\n393\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.420\nYou've been under attack for\nsix months prior to that.\n\n394\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.930\nThere's some research where they're\nshowing how long the average\n\n395\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.000\ndetection of an incident is and\nit's a long time.\n\n396\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.240\nAnd not everything right?\n\n397\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.710\nYou're casual hacker and things like that.\n\n398\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.093\nThis is not what they do.\n\n399\n00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:58.946\nBut your skilled hackers,\nyour state-sponsored hackers,\n\n400\n00:19:58.946 --> 00:20:04.437\nyour cyberterrorists, they're doing this\nadvanced persistent threat type attack.\n\n401\n00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:07.274\nAnd what that means is they're\ngetting into these systems, and\n\n402\n00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:08.930\nthen they're laying low.\n\n403\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:14.480\nAnd they're just gathering information for\nweeks and months at a time.\n\n404\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.210\nThey're trying to learn everything\nthey can about your infrastructure,\n\n405\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:24.030\ngathering of user information,\nbecause once I get in if I can just\n\n406\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.500\nbe that shadow in your network,\nthat ghost in the wire.\n\n407\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.270\nRight?\n\n408\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:33.560\nI could make all the noise I want, grab\nwhat I can and get out but then I'm done.\n\n409\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.750\nBut if I am stealthy about it,\n\n410\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.120\nI can get information on an ongoing\nbasis just keeps coming and\n\n411\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:46.090\nkeeps coming until you figure out\nthat the bad guys are actually there.\n\n412\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.070\nAnd by the time you do they're infiltrated\ninto everything in your network and\n\n413\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.800\nit becomes extremely difficult.\n\n414\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.190\nSo the advanced persistent threat,\nthese are very skilled attackers.\n\n415\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.910\nSometimes state sponsored attackers,\nterrorists,\n\n416\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.120\nthings like that,\nusually well funded, anyway.\n\n417\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.040\nThey have the latest and\ngreatest technology.\n\n418\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.452\nThey have resources,\nthis isn't your casual hacker.\n\n419\n00:21:10.452 --> 00:21:12.090\nThese are,\n\n420\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.150\ngroups that have money to try to\naccomplish their purpose, they're patient.\n\n421\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:23.410\nThey wait around they lie low like I\nsaid and they just, they sit there and\n\n422\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.760\nthey scan and gather more and\nmore information.\n\n423\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.250\nAnd then they can like I said\njust pull data at their leisure.\n\n424\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.960\nYou know,\ngoing slow as not to set off any alarms.\n\n425\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.940\nIt's scary, it really is scary to think\nabout how many organizations right now\n\n426\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.090\ncould be infected, or\n\n427\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.770\ncould have people in their networks that\nshouldn't be there and they have no idea.\n\n428\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.190\nBut anyway, we need definitions,\nthat's the advanced persistent threat.\n\n429\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.170\nAsymmetric warfare is another term\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n430\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.210\nAnd really, it's a military term.\n\n431\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.210\nWhen we talk about guerrilla tactics,\nwhere you've got somebody that's,\n\n432\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.850\nthe two parties that are at\nwar are not equal, okay?\n\n433\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.030\nYou've got one maybe that has a lot\nmore manpower, firepower, resources.\n\n434\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.100\nYou got the other side that's gonna try\nto use tactics to make up for their lack\n\n435\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:25.639\nof say resources or something like that\nwhich is what guerrilla tactics do, right?\n\n436\n00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:28.641\nAmbushes, you got this big\nole army coming at you.\n\n437\n00:22:28.641 --> 00:22:29.800\nWe've only got a few people.\n\n438\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.530\nSo we're gonna wait til we\ncan find a choke point.\n\n439\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.070\nWe're gonna take a few people and\ntake out a lot,\n\n440\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.720\nthat's the idea behind the asymmetric\nwarfare and this is what we see.\n\n441\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.530\nIt takes one person hacks into\n\n442\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:50.473\nsome box store and\ngets access to their account data base and\n\n443\n00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:56.670\ncompromises 50,000 accounts and\ncredit card information, right?\n\n444\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.910\nAnd this is a big organization\nthat you wouldn't think.\n\n445\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.670\nSony was one, I know,\nthat they used as an example.\n\n446\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.570\nHere's Sony is a big organization.\n\n447\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.660\nYou think they've got resources.\n\n448\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.960\nThey've got the technical know-how.\n\n449\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.130\nYet they were hacked, and they released.\n\n450\n00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.010\nThe bad guys were able to\ncompromise a lot of information.\n\n451\n00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.010\nThis is asymmetric warfare and\nunfortunately,\n\n452\n00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.560\nit's really what we have to do right\nas network securing professionals,\n\n453\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:26.720\nwe have to protect against everything and\neverybody at all times.\n\n454\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.590\nWhere the bad guy has his favorite\ntechnique that he likes to use.\n\n455\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.730\nHe's perfected it.\n\n456\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.690\nAnd Just this one lone attacker can\nbring down the big organizations.\n\n457\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.430\nSo that's asymmetric.\n\n458\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.490\nOffensive goals, now, this one,\nwe've talked about information warfare and\n\n459\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.180\noffensive goals.\n\n460\n00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.610\nThere's a lot of debate going on\nabout using offense as defense.\n\n461\n00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.985\nYou've heard this saying, a good offense.\n\n462\n00:23:55.985 --> 00:23:57.737\n&gt;&gt; A good defense is a good offense,\nor something like that.\n\n463\n00:23:57.737 --> 00:24:01.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, and so maybe by using\noffensive techniques I can help\n\n464\n00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.600\ndefensively or Hack back is a big one\nthat everybody's talking about right now.\n\n465\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.830\nShould we hack back?\n\n466\n00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.650\nMy company's gotten compromised.\n\n467\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.060\nI know where the attacker came from.\n\n468\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.080\nI can look at my log files.\n\n469\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.830\nWe've done our investigation.\n\n470\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.420\nI wanna hack him back.\n\n471\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.230\nOne, cuz I'm angry.\n\n472\n00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.630\n[LAUGH] I'm mad,\nthey've compromised my system.\n\n473\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.030\nIt's a pride thing.\n\n474\n00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.710\nIt's an anger thing, and it's\nan organization, I wanna hack them back.\n\n475\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.220\nThe problem is,\nit's usually not a good idea.\n\n476\n00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.350\nI will say that most\nsecurity professionals, and\n\n477\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:38.110\nI went to a lot of different events out at\nRSA this last year, or this year in 2017,\n\n478\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:43.806\nand the common theme was, if you're\nthe government, hacking back makes sense.\n\n479\n00:24:43.806 --> 00:24:47.790\nBut private sectors, companies,\n\n480\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.460\nthings like that, really it does not\nmake sense for you to try to hack back.\n\n481\n00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:59.130\nThe gain that you would get from hacking\nback is very, very small compared\n\n482\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.420\nto the amount of resources you're going to\nhave to dump in to hacking somebody back.\n\n483\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.730\nAnd, that's really the problem,\n\n484\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.940\nis there's not a good return\non your investment there.\n\n485\n00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.280\nYou'd be better off taking the money\nthat you're going to spend on\n\n486\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.460\nlaunching an attack and\nputting in defense.\n\n487\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.250\nSpending it where I know it's\ngoing to do me some good.\n\n488\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.840\nCuz in the end, what are you going to\naccomplish by hacking somebody back other\n\n489\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.590\nthan make yourself feel better?\n\n490\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.400\nI'll tell you what else\nis going to happen,\n\n491\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.380\nyou're going to spend a lot of money,\nand a lot of time trying to hack back.\n\n492\n00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.100\nDo you have the employees that have\nthe skill set to even hack back?\n\n493\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.840\nYou're going to get retaliation.\n\n494\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.567\nThey hacked you.\n\n495\n00:25:41.567 --> 00:25:42.677\n&gt;&gt; Now it becomes a war.\n\n496\n00:25:42.677 --> 00:25:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n&gt;&gt; Back and forth.\n\n497\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.780\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat hacker has a lot of hacker friends.\n\n498\n00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.320\nAnd you're gonna start a war that\nyou really didn't wanna start in\n\n499\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.170\nthe first place.\n\n500\n00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.400\nNot a good idea.\n\n501\n00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.890\n&gt;&gt; My mom used to say,\nare you gonna die on hill?\n\n502\n00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.580\nIs it worth it?\n\n503\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and typically not.\n\n504\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.456\nLike I said, it's a very small gain for\n\n505\n00:26:02.456 --> 00:26:05.409\nthe amount of money that\nyou're going to spend.\n\n506\n00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:09.976\nThen you also have to think of\nthe legal aspect of hacking back.\n\n507\n00:26:09.976 --> 00:26:14.570\nWhat if the system that is\nattacking you was a zombie?\n\n508\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.960\nWhat if it was a botnet full of zombies?\n\n509\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.330\nSo it was Daniel's work computer\nthat attacked my network?\n\n510\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:26.200\nSo when I hack back, I end up hacking\nback some other organization's laptop.\n\n511\n00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.710\nI don't have permission to do that.\n\n512\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.330\nNow, I'm just as bad as the hacker, I'm\nhacking some other organization's system.\n\n513\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.650\nIt wasn't that organization\nthat hacked me.\n\n514\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.720\nI could get angry with them.\n\n515\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.660\n&gt;&gt; It's not a crime to be bad at security,\nunfortunately [LAUGH].\n\n516\n00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.210\nSo you, so\n\n517\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.670\nnow all of a sudden you've gotta bring\nthe legal aspect of, am I even allowed to?\n\n518\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.680\nI don't know the systems that\nI'm getting ready to attack,\n\n519\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.320\nthat the attack was launched from.\n\n520\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.500\nSo I don't know if this is actually the\nhacker's system or an intermediate system.\n\n521\n00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.170\nSo it's just not a good idea.\n\n522\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.350\nYou know the other thing they'll\nsay when they talk about hack back\n\n523\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.310\nI always thought was interesting,\nwas you know reverse engineering\n\n524\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.570\nan attack is a lot easier than\ncoming up with an attack yourself.\n\n525\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.015\nThe example I was reading\nabout was Stuxnet.\n\n526\n00:27:11.015 --> 00:27:15.100\nStuxnet was an extremely complex\nattack that took advantage of\n\n527\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.590\nseveral vulnerabilities.\n\n528\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.468\nAnd once it got released,\nnow it's out there.\n\n529\n00:27:22.468 --> 00:27:25.300\nAnd everybody can stop and\nthey can analyze that code.\n\n530\n00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.050\nAnd they can tweak it to fit their needs,\nand\n\n531\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.860\nbasically create their own modified\nStuxnet to work in their needs.\n\n532\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.133\nSo that's another reason not to hack back.\n\n533\n00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:35.740\nI know that's a little bit of a stretch.\n\n534\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.650\nBut you know you don't want to\nexpose some of your techniques for\n\n535\n00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.610\nfear of them turning around and\nusing those same techniques against you.\n\n536\n00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Stuxnet used\nlike four zero-ay attacks.\n\n537\n00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It was insane.\n\n538\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.770\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy, but here's a somebody,\nsomething, some organization,\n\n539\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:51.320\nwe don't know who.\n\n540\n00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.092\n&gt;&gt; Wink, wink.\n\n541\n00:27:52.092 --> 00:27:53.539\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No verification, anyway,\n\n542\n00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:54.206\nof who did that.\n\n543\n00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:58.940\nBut they're sitting on\nthese zero-day attacks.\n\n544\n00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.760\nAnd why weren't they using them all?\n\n545\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.970\nWhy didn't they tell somebody about them?\n\n546\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they wanted to use it.\n\n547\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.730\n&gt;&gt; That's their ace in the hole.\n\n548\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.847\nThey know that they can whip\nthis out anytime they need it.\n\n549\n00:28:07.847 --> 00:28:10.206\nUnless somebody finds\nit before they use it,\n\n550\n00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:15.510\nthere's a good chance that they're gonna\nbe successful with that particular attack.\n\n551\n00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.020\nI know there's been a lot in the news\nabout certain documents leaking out and\n\n552\n00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.840\nfinding out about organizations here\nin the US that have been sitting on\n\n553\n00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.030\nall of these vulnerabilities.\n\n554\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:30.520\nThese zero days that they don't want to\nrelease because then they'll get patched,\n\n555\n00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.675\nand they won't be valid anymore.\n\n556\n00:28:32.675 --> 00:28:34.505\nBut that's another topic for another show,\n\n557\n00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:38.575\nand another day when we don't\nhave objectives to cover.\n\n558\n00:28:38.575 --> 00:28:42.365\nSo I think, Daniel, that pretty\nmuch covers attacks and malware.\n\n559\n00:28:42.365 --> 00:28:46.410\nAgain, it's a lot about understanding\nthe different types of attacks and\n\n560\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.450\nmalware that we're going to face.\n\n561\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.684\nAnd having a good terminology base,\nso that we can discuss these and\n\n562\n00:28:52.684 --> 00:28:54.998\nprotect our networks against them.\n\n563\n00:28:54.998 --> 00:28:57.355\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I think you said it great\nabout talking about being able\n\n564\n00:28:57.355 --> 00:28:58.150\nto discuss things.\n\n565\n00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.688\nYou have to be able to speak the language.\n\n566\n00:28:59.688 --> 00:29:04.473\nAnd a lot of that come down to basic\nterminology, definitions, brute force\n\n567\n00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:10.170\nmemorization of certain ideas and concepts\nthat are within the security community.\n\n568\n00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.710\nSo, it's just one of those things that\nwe have to do as security professionals.\n\n569\n00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.233\nAnd Mike, you did a fantastic job of\nwalking us through a litany of different\n\n570\n00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:22.404\nterms and definitions that we can\nnow assimilate into our language and\n\n571\n00:29:22.404 --> 00:29:24.116\nhave those conversations.\n\n572\n00:29:24.116 --> 00:29:25.420\nSo thank you for that.\n\n573\n00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.220\nWe do thank our good viewers for\njoining us.\n\n574\n00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.430\nBut I guess it's about that time for\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n575\n00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.140\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n576\n00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n577\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:41.526\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC].\n\n578\n00:29:41.526 -->

00:00:10.872\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:17.122\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:18.336\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:20.716\nAnd in today's episode, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:24.162\nwe are back with more on our\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:27.957\nAnd joining me in the studio is the man\nthat has been helping us along this\n\n9\n00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:28.598\nendeavor.\n\n10\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:32.711\nHe figures he'll come back for just one\nmore at least if not a little bit more\n\n11\n00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:35.350\nthan that, our good friend Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.300\nMike welcome back man.\n\n13\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.160\nWe're glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Hey thanks for having me back,\n\n15\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.810\nexcited as always to be doing\nour GIAC Security Essentials.\n\n16\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.410\nAll right so in this episode,\nwe wanna take a look at incident response.\n\n17\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.640\nAnd then, we wanna talk about incident\nhandling fundamentals, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.930\nAnd when we talk about incident response,\nplanning is a big part of it.\n\n19\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.520\nAnd so\nwe have to have an idea of what it means.\n\n20\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.658\nWhat is incident response?\n\n21\n00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.600\nAnd when we look at incident response in\nthat way, when we talk about fundamentals.\n\n22\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.450\nWe're really talking about five or\nsix different phases here.\n\n23\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.730\nWe've got preparation, identification,\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.240\ncontainment, eradication,\nrecovery, and then lessons learned.\n\n25\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.100\nSo those are the steps we're gonna go\nthrough as we do incident handling or\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.010\nincident response.\n\n27\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.420\nAnd so let's break each one of those\ndown so we understand what they mean.\n\n28\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.470\nAnd we'll just start at the beginning.\n\n29\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.070\nIt's always a good place to start.\n\n30\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.980\nAnd that is preparation.\n\n31\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.270\nWe have to prepare before we attempt\nto do any type of incident response.\n\n32\n00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810\nNow what does that preparation include?\n\n33\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.250\nWell primarily it's going to be policies,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.290\nOr a big part of it I guess I should say,\nis policies.\n\n35\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.190\nAnd we put our policies in place that\n\n36\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.540\ntell us what we're gonna do\nin the event of an incident.\n\n37\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.280\nHow we're gonna go about handling it.\n\n38\n00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.860\nWho is gonna do what,\nwho needs to be contacted.\n\n39\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.960\nWhat we define as an incident.\n\n40\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.600\nAll of that is going\nto be in our policies.\n\n41\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.640\nSo policies are gonna play\na big part in the preparation.\n\n42\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.940\nAnd then training is gonna be\nthe other big part of preparation.\n\n43\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.110\nAnd that means taking these policies\nthat we've created and testing them out.\n\n44\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.955\nMaking sure we go through our procedures.\n\n45\n00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:28.175\nMake sure we do tabletop\nexercises if that's what it takes\n\n46\n00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.775\nto make sure we don't have\nany gaps in our policies.\n\n47\n00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:36.575\nAnything that we've missed that we haven't\nthough of might show itself doing these\n\n48\n00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:37.867\ntabletop exercises.\n\n49\n00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:42.496\nSo training, how to handle evidence,\n\n50\n00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:46.150\nfollowing chains of custody.\n\n51\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.213\nDoing practices where we try\nto do an investigation on\n\n52\n00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.120\na computer imaging hard drives.\n\n53\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.310\nAll of that,\nwe should practice all of that.\n\n54\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.799\nSo when it comes to preparation, getting\nready for incident response is going to\n\n55\n00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.980\ninclude having these policies and\nprocedures in place.\n\n56\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.260\nAs well as going through training.\n\n57\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.540\nAnd then we get to\nthe identification phase.\n\n58\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.780\nAnd so we've done all of our policies.\n\n59\n00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.620\nWe've got everything laid out of\nwhat we're gonna do in the event of\n\n60\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.060\nan incident.\n\n61\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.200\nWe've practiced it over and over again so\n\n62\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.300\nI can do it in the dark without\neven thinking about it.\n\n63\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.720\nWe're good to go there.\n\n64\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.740\nNow we've got the identification phase.\n\n65\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.010\nAnd this is the identification,\nwe'll call it a phase.\n\n66\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.840\nThis is where we determined that there\nhas been some type of incident, right.\n\n67\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.400\nThat that something is going to\ntrigger our incident response plan.\n\n68\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.360\nNow where did we get this information,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.290\nWell what is it that leads us to believe\nthat there's been an incident, or\n\n70\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.620\nthat we've identified an incident?\n\n71\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.756\nAnd we look at log files, are probably\none of the big sources of information.\n\n72\n00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:53.400\n&gt;&gt; I assume there are some\nblatant things like,\n\n73\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.315\nthere's ransomware on my computer and\nit's asking me for BitCoin.\n\n74\n00:03:56.315 --> 00:04:00.510\nRight, that would definitely be like,\nI have an incident happening.\n\n75\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would most likely\nfall under say employees.\n\n76\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.190\nBecause they're gonna call somebody and\nsay, hey look.\n\n77\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.540\nI've got this big thing on my desk,\nand it's on my desktop, that says,\n\n78\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440\nI've been infected, or\nall of my files have been encrypted.\n\n79\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.830\nHere's where you can put your credit card\nnumber in to pay to get your files back.\n\n80\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.530\nYeah, so definitely,\nwould be a sign of an incident.\n\n81\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.350\nYour IDSs and your IPSs, right?\n\n82\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.920\nYour intrusion detection systems,\nthey're capturing all that information\n\n83\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.240\nfrom all your different\nsensors from your servers.\n\n84\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.160\nIPSs might be sending you\nalerts letting you know that\n\n85\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.870\nthere's been malicious behavior.\n\n86\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.040\nIt might automate some of that.\n\n87\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.880\nSo IDSs and IPSs, SIEM systems,\nsystem information and event management.\n\n88\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.520\nThese are correlating log files from\nmultiple devices on our network,\n\n89\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.930\npulling it all together.\n\n90\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.000\nGreat place to look for\nsigns of an incident.\n\n91\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.860\nAntivirus software can warn you,\nhey this system has been infected.\n\n92\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.640\nIt was quarantined but\nI still need to go and respond and\n\n93\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.870\ntake a look at what it was,\nhow it got there.\n\n94\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.910\nMaking sure it didn't spread.\n\n95\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.890\nOr maybe it wasn't quarantined, right?\n\n96\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.070\nBut AV can be an alert system to tell\nme we've got an infection or incident.\n\n97\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.850\nExploit websites, right?\n\n98\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.580\nGoing out and doing your research.\n\n99\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.019\nSo, remember we've talked\nabout this before,\n\n100\n00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:18.758\nyou have to stay on top of\nthings in the security world.\n\n101\n00:05:18.758 --> 00:05:23.312\nYou need to follow bug trackers and news\nfeeds that these antivirus vendors put\n\n102\n00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:26.010\nout, other security organizations put out.\n\n103\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:33.190\nBecause they're gonna give you information\nabout exploits that have been seen.\n\n104\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.170\nOr vulnerabilities that have\nbeen discovered that we might be\n\n105\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.040\nsusceptible to.\n\n106\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.895\nHacker sites, right,\nthey can give you just as much,\n\n107\n00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:45.330\nsome valuable information as well.\n\n108\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.761\nAnd to be careful when\nyou go to them sites and\n\n109\n00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:50.006\ndon't infect yourself going to those.\n\n110\n00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:52.740\nBut they might put information\ntalking there talking with each other.\n\n111\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.624\nThere's information for other hackers\nabout techniques they've learned or\n\n112\n00:05:56.624 --> 00:05:58.750\nplaces they've been able to compromise.\n\n113\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.160\nWe'll find information there.\n\n114\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.820\nVendors put out information, Microsoft,\nAdobe, all these different vendors.\n\n115\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.960\nIf there's been\na vulnerability discovered,\n\n116\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.680\nthey'll put out a patch for it.\n\n117\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.390\nAnd in the release for that patch,\nthey'll typically talk about\n\n118\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.060\nsymptoms of an infection,\nwhat they're trying to patch.\n\n119\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.060\nSo this vulnerability is,\n\n120\n00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.630\nwhat it might look like if somebody\ntries to take advantage of it.\n\n121\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.610\nSo you can get information there.\n\n122\n00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.530\nAnd as I said, employees can be\na big source of information as well,\n\n123\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.190\nthey're kind of our front line,\nour eyes and ears out there.\n\n124\n00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.280\nThey're gonna let us know when\nsomething weird is going on.\n\n125\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.903\nHey, my computer, it was kind of\nflickering when I went to log onto this\n\n126\n00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:44.770\npage, or my screen's turned upside down.\n\n127\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.680\nSilly little,\nI shouldn't say silly little.\n\n128\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.073\nBut some of those things that we used to\nassociate with malware was the CD Rom\n\n129\n00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:52.830\ndrawer opening up on its own.\n\n130\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.560\nTypically I don't see\nmuch of that any more.\n\n131\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.388\nBut again it's the end user that's out\nthere that's dealing with the systems.\n\n132\n00:06:58.388 --> 00:07:01.396\nThat will probably be the first\none to see signs of an infection.\n\n133\n00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:06.850\nSo they can be a great source\nof identification of incidents.\n\n134\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.700\nA lot of places we want to be monitoring,\nlooking for signs of an incident.\n\n135\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.080\nOnce we have picked up on a sign, that\nwe've got something that's indicating,\n\n136\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.390\nthat there has been an incident.\n\n137\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.260\nWe do our investigation, we found\nout there was some type of incident.\n\n138\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.010\nOur next task is to contain that, right?\n\n139\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.710\nI do not want that spreading\nto the rest of my network,\n\n140\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.790\nI want to try to minimize the impact\nthat this incident was able to cause.\n\n141\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.810\nWhether that's somebody getting access to\nmy file server, they're exfiltrating data.\n\n142\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.175\nMaybe I stop that network connection so\n\n143\n00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:44.120\nthey can't get anymore\ndata out of the network.\n\n144\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.410\nIf it's a piece of malware,\nI segregate or isolate that system so\n\n145\n00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.655\nthat it can't spread other\nmachines on my network.\n\n146\n00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:57.328\nSo maybe you disconnect\nit from the network,\n\n147\n00:07:57.328 --> 00:08:00.428\nyou quarantine it Or you tolerate it.\n\n148\n00:08:00.428 --> 00:08:05.886\nThat sounds odd but it might be\nan incident where it's like okay,\n\n149\n00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.467\nI see that this is occurring but\n\n150\n00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:13.070\nit doesn't warrant any\ntype of incident response.\n\n151\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.830\nWe're going to basically wait it out.\n\n152\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.370\nEither deal with it because the risk or\n\n153\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.630\nthe impact is so small that we're\nnot that concerned with it,\n\n154\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.680\nor we need to wait for\nfurther development on the incident.\n\n155\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.300\nThen comes the eradication.\n\n156\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.990\nOnce we've got that contained,\nonce we've got the infected system or\n\n157\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.030\nsystems isolated from\nthe rest of the network,\n\n158\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.530\nor whatever type of incident it might be,\nthen we try to eradicate, right?\n\n159\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.230\nWe try to get rid of the malware,\nfor example,\n\n160\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.120\nwe remove the back door that somebody's\nbeen using to get into our system.\n\n161\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.780\nWe deactivate accounts.\n\n162\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.230\n&gt;&gt; You pay the bit coins [LAUGH].\n\n163\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.740\n&gt;&gt; You'll pay the bit coins to get\nyour encryption key, all right?\n\n164\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.730\nBut we're doing our eradication and\n\n165\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.500\nthis gonna include patching\nsystems against vulnerabilities.\n\n166\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.760\nSo patching, removing software,\nrebuilding systems.\n\n167\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.170\nThen we get into the recovery phase.\n\n168\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.420\nOnce we've eradicated that, now I need\nto get that system back into service.\n\n169\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.770\nI need to get that end\nuser their system back, or\n\n170\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.290\nI need to get that file\nserver back online.\n\n171\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.700\nI need to get that DNS server so\nit's responding to queries again.\n\n172\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.510\nAfter we've removed it from the network,\ndone our containment or eradication.\n\n173\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.960\nNow we're trying to get back, we wanna\nget everything back the way it was.\n\n174\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.540\nSo get your services back online.\n\n175\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.870\nAnd then the phase that people kind of\nsometimes either forget about or slack off\n\n176\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.715\non, don't think it's all that important\nis the lessons learned phase, right?\n\n177\n00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:49.005\nAnd this is where once we've\ndone our incident response and\n\n178\n00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:53.835\nwe've followed our steps, we've gone\nthrough our procedures just like our plan\n\n179\n00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:56.235\ntold us to do laid it out for us.\n\n180\n00:09:56.235 --> 00:10:00.885\nWe've done our reporting,\nwe've documented everything along the way.\n\n181\n00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:03.475\nNow we sit back and\nwe do a lessons learned.\n\n182\n00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:06.730\nWe look at what happened\nHow it reacted to it,\n\n183\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.550\nwhat we did what the outcome\nwas of our incident handling.\n\n184\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.400\nAnd we try to figure out if there is\nsomething we could have done better.\n\n185\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.100\nSomething we might have missed.\n\n186\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.060\nMaybe we did some steps out of order and\n\n187\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.640\nthat caused a problem in\nwhich we rearrange those.\n\n188\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.280\nOr we missed a step all together,\nbecause it wasn't documented properly or\n\n189\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.130\nmaybe we thought of something\nafter looking at this.\n\n190\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.050\nWe're like wow if we would've done this,\nit would've made this next step so\n\n191\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.970\nmuch easier, right?\n\n192\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.980\nOr could have prevented it altogether.\n\n193\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.310\nThis is where the lesson's\nlearned comes into play.\n\n194\n00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.010\nTrying to learn from what's happened so\nthat it doesn't happen again.\n\n195\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.670\nOr so\nwe can handle things better the next time.\n\n196\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.940\nSo what'd I say one, two, three,\nfour, five, six phases there.\n\n197\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.600\nPreparation, identification,\ncontainment, eradication, recovery, and\n\n198\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.180\nthen lessons learned.\n\n199\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Mike now that we know\nthe phases that you were giving us there,\n\n200\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.690\nwhat are some of the ways in which we can\nwe kind of talked about identification?\n\n201\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.370\nSome of the techniques that we can\nuse to collect the data figure out\n\n202\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.310\nwhat's going on?\n\n203\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.590\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question Daniel.\n\n204\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.700\nWe've got several different\ntechniques that we will apply or\n\n205\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.910\nuse during an incident response.\n\n206\n00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.720\nYou've got your collection, right?\n\n207\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.220\nWe need to understand how to collect data,\n\n208\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.120\nhow to collect information\nabout the bridge.\n\n209\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.740\nWe have to do it in a way that we can,\nwhat if we wanna prosecute in the end?\n\n210\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.540\nSo we've got to follow\nour proper techniques,\n\n211\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.110\nand gathering the evidence, being able\n\n212\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.600\nto prove that the evidence has not been\nmodified during a gathering phase.\n\n213\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.050\nMaking copies of it so\n\n214\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.640\nthat we can work with that,\nanalyze it without modifying the original.\n\n215\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.350\nSo in the collection phase, data is\nidentified as something that we find or\n\n216\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.940\nthink might be useful\nin our investigation.\n\n217\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.250\nWe'll collect the information\nup in a forensically sound way.\n\n218\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.920\nAnd then we'll perform the investigation\nor investigation technique\n\n219\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.590\nwhere you have to be able to analyze\nthe information that we've collected.\n\n220\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.720\nWe pulled all this information in,\nnow what, right?\n\n221\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.680\nIt's not gonna just tell\nus what the answer is.\n\n222\n00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.260\nWe've gotta sift through all of that, and\n\n223\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.720\nlook at those drive images,\nlooking for evidence that we can use.\n\n224\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.920\nSo we're gonna be using different tools,\nforensics tools,\n\n225\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.340\ndisk duplicators, hashing algorithms\nto make sure nothing has been modified.\n\n226\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.120\nMaybe, I don't know, what's another\none steganography analysis looking for\n\n227\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.100\nhidden data within other files.\n\n228\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.750\nBut the examination techniques\nthat we use again very\n\n229\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.700\nimportant that we understand\nhow to go about those?\n\n230\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.850\nIt really depends on your organization and\nwhat you plan on doing with this.\n\n231\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.740\nIf it's just for internal use,\nmaybe you don't have to worry so\n\n232\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.030\nmuch about being forensically sound,\nright?\n\n233\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.850\nThere's a big difference between\ndoing just an incident response\n\n234\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.660\nversus doing a criminal investigation.\n\n235\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.330\nAnd whether or not I need to have this\ninformation be presentable in a court of\n\n236\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.010\nlaw whether it's acceptable as evidence,\nproof that it hasn't been modified.\n\n237\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.130\nWe also need to understand how\nto analyze the information,\n\n238\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.015\ntaking the results of the examination and\nthen analyzing it,\n\n239\n00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:16.895\nextracting information out of\nthe results of our examination.\n\n240\n00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:19.005\nIt's what analysis is all about.\n\n241\n00:13:19.005 --> 00:13:23.080\nAnd then reporting is just taking\nthe analysis and turning it into a report.\n\n242\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.499\nSomething that I might need\nto turn into the C-level\n\n243\n00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:32.780\nexecutives or to the lawyers\nthat are prosecuting the case.\n\n244\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.560\nBut it will generate reports\nthat kinda summarize everything,\n\n245\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.430\nbecause the data we collect,\n\n246\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.390\nif we go back to the beginning technique\nwe talked about the collection of data.\n\n247\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.780\nIt's gonna be a lot of information,\nnot all of it relevant or\n\n248\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.680\npertinent, or useful.\n\n249\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.700\nSo we need to be able to make sure we\ncan concisely report on the information\n\n250\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.910\nthat we found.\n\n251\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.250\nThe investigation that we've done,\nthe analysis.\n\n252\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.050\nWe need to be able to\ntake that information and\n\n253\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.210\nputting it in a nice,\nconcise, meaningful report.\n\n254\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.680\nThat also brings in the legal\naspects of incident handling,\n\n255\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.140\nsomething else that we've got to consider.\n\n256\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.260\nWhen we talk about incident handling,\nyou're gonna have laws and\n\n257\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.710\nregulations that you might or\nmight not have to follow.\n\n258\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Adhere to.\n&gt;&gt; Or adhere to, yeah.\n\n259\n00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.380\nSo that's your due diligence.\n\n260\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.300\nYou have to know What laws are applicable,\nwhat regulations are applicable?\n\n261\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.590\nWe have healthcare information, so we\nneed to make sure we're following HIPAA.\n\n262\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.270\nWe also take credit cards for\nhealth payments, so\n\n263\n00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.480\nI need to follow PCI, might be in play.\n\n264\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.799\nSo understanding what the different\n\n265\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.980\nregulations that your\norganization has to follow.\n\n266\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.840\nAnd the laws, whether that's local,\nstate, governmental, and\n\n267\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.760\nit differs from country to country.\n\n268\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.390\nSo where that data resides,\nif you're a multinational organization,\n\n269\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.140\ncan have a big impact on how\nyou handle these incidents.\n\n270\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I made a joke in a previous\nshow about, it's not a crime to be bad\n\n271\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.795\nat security unless you work in a financial\ninstitution or some sort of health care.\n\n272\n00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:04.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yes, it is a crime.\n\n273\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.400\nWell, even government, I think that\nwould probably fall under the umbrella.\n\n274\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.540\n&gt;&gt; But as we're going through,\n\n275\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.730\nlet's say we're doing our data gathering,\nbecause we're doing our incident response,\n\n276\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.210\nand we're in that first phase and\nwe're gathering information.\n\n277\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.410\nAnd some of this information is personal,\nright?\n\n278\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.500\nIf I'm going into an employee's\nsystem what rights do they have,\n\n279\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.390\nwhat rights of privacy\ndo they have if any?\n\n280\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.820\nDepending again on the laws\nof your country and\n\n281\n00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.860\nyour organization and\nacceptable use policies.\n\n282\n00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.208\nI have to understand that.\n\n283\n00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:40.940\nAm I gonna be violating any human rights\nfor my employees, in the course of this\n\n284\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.410\ninvestigation, or how can I make sure we\navoid is really what we're trying to do.\n\n285\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.696\nAvoid that, so when it comes to instant\nhandling, we have to be aware of the laws.\n\n286\n00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:53.055\nWe might have lawyers, on staff that\nwe deal with, or we might have to\n\n287\n00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:57.277\nbring in our outside people for\nconsultation to help us with that.\n\n288\n00:15:57.277 --> 00:16:00.289\nEvidence handling, kind of the same thing.\n\n289\n00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:02.523\nYou're gonna have different regulation or\n\n290\n00:16:02.523 --> 00:16:05.660\ndifferent rules of evidence\nin different countries.\n\n291\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.940\nBut understanding what those\nare because if I go in and\n\n292\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.650\ndon't do a good job, if I'm doing the\ninvestigation or the incident response and\n\n293\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.910\nI'm gathering this information up and\nI start analyzing this information.\n\n294\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:25.540\nAnd we decide we want to prosecute, and\nI didn't follow the proper procedures and\n\n295\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.745\nI have no way of proving that I haven't\nmodified this drive since we collected it,\n\n296\n00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:31.803\nit's going to be thrown out.\n\n297\n00:16:31.803 --> 00:16:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Contaminated of the evidence\nbecause there is no verification.\n\n298\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.131\nI can't say, beyond a shadow of the doubt,\nthis is the same data,\n\n299\n00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:39.672\nit hasn't been corrupted.\n\n300\n00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:41.390\nIt hasn't been altered or\nmodified any way,\n\n301\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.650\nshape or\nform because I didn't handle it correctly.\n\n302\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.520\nAnd then, therefore,\nthe defense is gonna say, well, if you\n\n303\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.580\ncan't verify the integrity of the data\nthat has to be thrown out as evidence.\n\n304\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.980\n&gt;&gt; And we've seen the shows, and I know\nmost of our TV shows are a little far\n\n305\n00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.610\nfetched but there are-\n&gt;&gt; The idea is right.\n\n306\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're based on a little bit\nof truth, they just have to make it\n\n307\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.650\ndramatic so that we'll tune in\nnext time for the next episode.\n\n308\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.060\nBut there is, again,\na little bit of truth in there.\n\n309\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.020\nWhen that defense team,\nthey're not just looking,\n\n310\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.780\nI mean what's a good way to put this.\n\n311\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.570\nYes, they wanna defend their client and\nprove his innocence, but\n\n312\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.400\nthey will do everything they can\nto get to that means, I guess, or\n\n313\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.560\ntrying to think of a better way to put it.\n\n314\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.080\nLet's just say that it would not be above\nthem to attack the evidence itself.\n\n315\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, the veracity.\n\n316\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's an easy way.\n\n317\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.990\nIf I can get your main piece of evidence\nthrown out of court, you now have no case.\n\n318\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:40.340\nSo they will attack you, the incidence\nresponse team, and how you handled things.\n\n319\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.270\nAnd you're gonna be called up on\nthe hot seat and be asked questions and\n\n320\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.790\ntalk about how you handle data, and\nwhat your normal procedures are.\n\n321\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.840\nThey're gonna look through your procedures\nand make sure they're documented and\n\n322\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.530\nthat you're following them.\n\n323\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.790\nSo when it comes to evidence handling\nwe have to make sure we're doing it\n\n324\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.770\nproperly and\n\n325\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.255\nreally you're better off even if you don't\nthink you will be prosecuting in the end.\n\n326\n00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:05.990\nIt's a good idea to follow those anyway so\nthat in the event you do,\n\n327\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.640\nit's a lot easier to say yep,\nlet's go ahead a prosecute than it is to,\n\n328\n00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.300\nI said we weren't going to but\nnow I think we are.\n\n329\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.280\nWell, it's a little too late because\nI didn't take hash values on\n\n330\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.950\nany of that as I collected it,\nit was all going to be in house.\n\n331\n00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:23.400\nSo evidence handling preserving\nthe integrity of the data,\n\n332\n00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.420\nfollowing chains of custody.\n\n333\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.010\nMaking sure that evidence is\ndocumented every step of the way from\n\n334\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.390\nthe collection phase to transport who's\ndoing the analysis as you check it in and\n\n335\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.390\nout of the evidence locker.\n\n336\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.490\nAll of this information needs to be there\nto preserve the integrity of that data.\n\n337\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.470\nSo when it comes to incidence response,\n\n338\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.960\na lot of things that\nwe've got to be aware of.\n\n339\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.250\nWe've got to think about\nthe different fundamentals,\n\n340\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.740\nthose steps basically that we go\nthrough in an incidence response.\n\n341\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.990\nPreparation, getting ready, getting the\nteam ready to do incidence response and\n\n342\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.670\nthen we've got your\nidentification of the incident.\n\n343\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.460\nBecause our incident response team doesn't\ndo us any good if we don't identify\n\n344\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.800\nan incident to happen,\nwe gotta know when to respond.\n\n345\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.400\nOnce we respond now we\ngotta contain the incident.\n\n346\n00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.020\nWe've gotta make sure that we're doing\nwhat we can to prevent the spread,\n\n347\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.010\nthen we're going to eradicate.\n\n348\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.380\nWe're going to remove the virus or\nthe Trojan horse or\n\n349\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.760\nwhatever it is that prompted\nthe incidence response.\n\n350\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.130\nThen we're going to into our recovery,\n\n351\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:31.830\ngetting those systems back online\nonce we're sure that they are clean.\n\n352\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.780\nWhether than means rebuilding\nthe system all together, restoring it\n\n353\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.090\nfrom a backup or simply doing a removal of\nthe software and putting it back online.\n\n354\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.170\nAnd then the lessons learned.\n\n355\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.021\nMaking sure that we take the time\nto get the team together and\n\n356\n00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:50.412\ntalk about how we handled the incident and\nwhether or\n\n357\n00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:53.893\nnot there's anything we can\ndo better the next time.\n\n358\n00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:56.549\nWe're always looking to improve\nour incident response plan,\n\n359\n00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:57.740\nthis is the time to do it.\n\n360\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.180\nAfter the incident has occurred and\neverything's all put back together and\n\n361\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.610\nwe're calm again.\n\n362\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.560\nNow let's sit and\nlook at what we did, how it went, and\n\n363\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.970\ntry to identify anything that was not,\nor any weaknesses in our plan,\n\n364\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.350\nany gaps in our plan, and\nfix those for the next incident.\n\n365\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, well incidence response\nobviously has as lot of moving\n\n366\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.900\nparts to it.\n\n367\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.970\nA lot of things we need to take in account\nas s work through those phases and\n\n368\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.870\ndifferent techniques that\nare available for us in that endeavor.\n\n369\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.290\nMike, we do thank you for\nwalking us down that road and\n\n370\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.990\nholding our hands because\nwe're new to this.\n\n371\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.050\nAnd as I like to say, no one was born\nwith this knowledge, we acquire it, and\n\n372\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.380\nwe appreciate you giving it to us so\nthat we have it as well.\n\n373\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.138\nThank you guys for watching but it looks\nlike it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n374\n00:20:44.138 --> 00:20:47.220\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n375\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.903\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n376\n00:20:47.903 --> 00:20:50.366\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n377\n00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:56.339\n[MUSIC]\n\n378\n00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:59.377\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.990\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.040\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\n\n5\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.760\nand in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our GIAC Security Essentials.\n\n6\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240\nOr you might have heard\nthem call GSEC Essentials.\n\n7\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.090\nAnd joining us back in the studios today\nis none other than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.190\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.850\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.530\nGlad to be back and excited because today\nwe're gonna be covering cryptography.\n\n11\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.550\nAnother one of those really cool topics,\none that's fun to talk about.\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.638\nAlso one that's very important to the\nsecurity of our enterprise and our data.\n\n13\n00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:43.560\nAnd in this episode we're not\ngonna dive into breaking code and\n\n14\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.670\ntrying to break encryption and\nthings like that.\n\n15\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.675\nBut we do have to have a good fundamental\nunderstanding of why we use encryption,\n\n16\n00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.615\ndifferent methods of how we can implement\nencryption, and things like that.\n\n17\n00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:58.195\nSo we'll start with just\nsome basic concepts and\n\n18\n00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.325\nterms that we need to be familiar with.\n\n19\n00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:04.590\nWhen we talk about encryption, we're\ntalking about taking something that's\n\n20\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.675\nin what we would call plain text,\nor human readable.\n\n21\n00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:14.130\nAnd converting that into\nsomething we call cipher text, or\n\n22\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.040\nit's no longer human readable.\n\n23\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.351\nI need a bit of information and\n\n24\n00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:23.722\nan algorithm to decrypt that information\nso that I can read it again.\n\n25\n00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:25.753\nSo we're gonna take something\nthat's human readable and\n\n26\n00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:27.790\nturn into something that's\nnot human readable.\n\n27\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.800\nTake something that's in plain text,\nturn it into cipher text.\n\n28\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.252\nDifferent terms for\nkind of the same thing.\n\n29\n00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:36.300\nThere are plain texts, cipher texts,\nhuman readable, not human readable.\n\n30\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.470\nI do wanna differentiate, too,\nbetween encryption and code, right.\n\n31\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.450\nWith code,\nwe're typically substituting words,\n\n32\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.070\nbut we're not really advertising the fact\nthat there is hidden data in there.\n\n33\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.730\nI can remember reading\none example about a code.\n\n34\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.460\nIt was a military thing where it\nwas kill so and so at 2 o'clock.\n\n35\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd the code was meet so\nand so at 2 o'clock.\n\n36\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.170\nSo the code was the word kill\nreplaced with the word meet.\n\n37\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.810\nSo, somebody that sees that\nphrase written down or\n\n38\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.550\nhears it wouldn't think anything of it.\n\n39\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.410\nOnly if you knew the code, which you know\nto replace the word meet with kill and\n\n40\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.058\nyou get the alternate meaning to it.\n\n41\n00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:23.200\nBut with a code, you typically,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n42\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.700\nYou're kinda hiding the fact that\nthere's any hidden date there, right?\n\n43\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.610\nWhereas with encryption,\nwe're not hiding the fact.\n\n44\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.460\nIt's obvious when you look at something\nthat's encrypted that it's encrypted.\n\n45\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.240\nSo there's a known secret there, I just\ncan't read it because it is encrypted.\n\n46\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.072\nSo a little bit of\na difference between code and\n\n47\n00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:47.568\nencryption that we should be\nfamiliar with, all right.\n\n48\n00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:51.992\nAnd then a couple other terms that I\nalways find confusing words is cipher and\n\n49\n00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:52.890\nalgorithm.\n\n50\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.120\nCuz these are another two terms that\ndepending on whose book you're reading or\n\n51\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.520\nwhere you're looking you might see\nthese terms used interchangeably.\n\n52\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.280\nAnd honestly, most of us can, but\nif we wanna get technical and we shoot for\n\n53\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.090\nthe exam, right?\n\n54\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.010\nIf we wanna get technical there is\na little bit of a difference between\n\n55\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.450\na cipher and an algorithm.\n\n56\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.240\nAn algorithm is really just a mathematical\nformula that we can apply to information.\n\n57\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.910\nIn this case we'll be working with data or\ninformation.\n\n58\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.330\nSo it's a precise set of steps\nthat we would go through but\n\n59\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.240\nit's not necessarily encryption.\n\n60\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.880\nThere's mathematical algorithms for,\nI don't know, what's a good example?\n\n61\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.550\nDetermining the circumference of a circle,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.210\nA cipher is when we use these algorithm or\nalgorithms for\n\n63\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.020\nthe purpose of encrypting data, right?\n\n64\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.270\nSo cipher is also a series of\nsteps that I have to go through.\n\n65\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.852\nBut the end result of a cipher\nis have encrypted data,\n\n66\n00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:58.990\nwhereas an algorithm is not\nnecessarily used to encrypt.\n\n67\n00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.810\nSo again, it's a little confusing right?\n\n68\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you know it makes sense.\n\n69\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.480\nIn this series here you showed us how to\ntake binary and convert it to decimal, and\n\n70\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.770\ndecimal convert back to binary.\n\n71\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.115\nThat's a set of steps, right?\n\n72\n00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:12.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n73\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.207\nthat's basic form would be an algorithm,\nbut it wasn't done for\n\n74\n00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:18.270\nthe purposes of keeping it secret to us.\n\n75\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.584\nOf course if you look at it for the first\ntime it could be a little bit confusing.\n\n76\n00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:22.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.290\n&gt;&gt; But, in the end of the day,\n\n78\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.200\nit's still just an algorithm.\n\n79\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great example there.\n\n80\n00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:27.810\nSo again,\ndepending on what you're reading,\n\n81\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.720\nyou might see them used interchangeably.\n\n82\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.310\nMost of the time it's not gonna make\na difference to us which one we're\n\n83\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.130\nusing except for maybe on this exam.\n\n84\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.280\nAll right, now,\nlet's talk about why we use encryption.\n\n85\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.610\nAnd the idea here is that we want to\nmake sure only authorized people can\n\n86\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.820\naccess the data.\n\n87\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.570\nSo we're using encryption for\nconfidentiality.\n\n88\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.030\nThis is one reason we\nwould use encryption.\n\n89\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.030\nIt keeps something confidential.\n\n90\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.210\nOnly if you are authorized, or\nwe give you access to the information,\n\n91\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.190\nare you going to be able to see it.\n\n92\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.920\nCuz you're gonna have to have\nthe bit of information, the key,\n\n93\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.420\nwhich we're gonna talk about in a minute.\n\n94\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.700\nTo be able to decrypt the information and\nget it out.\n\n95\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.370\nEverybody might see that maybe that\nfile is sitting there, for example.\n\n96\n00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.500\nBut if you try to double click on it,\n\n97\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.940\nyou're not going to be able to decrypt\nit and open it if you're not authorized.\n\n98\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.180\nSo that's what we mean by providing\nconfidentiality through encryption.\n\n99\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.631\nAnd it is really one of\nthe biggest reasons, probably,\n\n100\n00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:23.450\nthat we use encryption,\nis to keep data confidential.\n\n101\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.350\nFiles on our hard drive,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n102\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.360\nSo, confidentiality is important.\n\n103\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.950\nThe other one that encryption provides\nthat a lot of people will miss\n\n104\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.390\nis gonna be integrity, right?\n\n105\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.180\nAnd when we talk about integrity,\nwe're trying to say that data has not been\n\n106\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.860\nmodified since it was created,\nin an accidental or malicious way.\n\n107\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.590\nSo that the data we're seeing is\nthe data that we were intended to see,\n\n108\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.050\nit hasn't been modified.\n\n109\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.720\nThat's what we call data integrity.\n\n110\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.590\nAnd if something's encrypted,\nwell it becomes\n\n111\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.143\nvery difficult to change that information\nwithout being able to decrypt it.\n\n112\n00:05:59.143 --> 00:06:03.030\nNear impossible to change it in any\nmeaningful way the way to where we're not\n\n113\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.290\ngoing to suspect that it's been modified.\n\n114\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.924\nSo, in a way encryption does provide for\nintegrity as well.\n\n115\n00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:15.630\nSo, confidentiality, integrity,\nit can also provide nonrepudiation.\n\n116\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.700\nAnother crazy term that we\nshould probably define.\n\n117\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.950\nNonrepudiation is when I can verify the\noriginator of the information or the data.\n\n118\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.470\nWe often talk about that with emails.\n\n119\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.318\nI know that email came from Wes,\nI have nonrepudiation.\n\n120\n00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:33.158\nHe can't deny that he sent that email.\n\n121\n00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:37.440\nOr Bob can't deny that\nhe wrote that document.\n\n122\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.380\nThat's nonrepudiation.\n\n123\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.080\nAnd with encryption,\nwe can get nonrepudiation in a way,\n\n124\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.838\ndepending on what we are doing,\nby the keys that are being used.\n\n125\n00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:51.130\nCuz keys can be assigned to individuals,\nonly they have access to those keys.\n\n126\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.880\nSo if that key was used,\nit had to be encrypted by that individual,\n\n127\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.550\ntherefore nonrepudiation, all lright.\n\n128\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.220\n&gt;&gt; So those steps that we have to go\nthrough, it's something that's gonna\n\n129\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.928\nprobably, in your example,\nit's going to be unique to you and I.\n\n130\n00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:07.302\nOne modification in that series or\nsequence of steps and\n\n131\n00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.720\nthen now suddenly you can't maybe gain\naccess to the data or we can see that.\n\n132\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.200\nYou know you mentioned S/MIME maybe,\ninside of emails or\n\n133\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.590\nsomething that you'll show us\nlater down the way, like IPsec.\n\n134\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.151\nThe process of going\ninto that communication,\n\n135\n00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:23.768\nif it's modified in any little way, then\nwe're going to be able to see that, right?\n\n136\n00:07:23.768 --> 00:07:24.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n137\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.430\nLet's say boss is sending\nan email to my manager and\n\n138\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.470\nit says, Mike should be fired,\nbut it's encrypted.\n\n139\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.794\nIf I tried to intercept that, I can't\nchange the word fire to give a raise,\n\n140\n00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:39.586\nbecause I can't see in that message,\nbecause it's encrypted.\n\n141\n00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:42.822\nSo I'm not gonna be able to\nmodify in any meaningful way.\n\n142\n00:07:42.822 --> 00:07:45.920\nAll right so, that's some terms\nwe need to be familiar with.\n\n143\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.430\nWe'll define a few more as we\ngo throughout this episode here.\n\n144\n00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.843\nNext thing I wanna talk\nabout are the differences.\n\n145\n00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:57.307\nThere's a couple of different,\nsay types of encryption, or methods,\n\n146\n00:07:57.307 --> 00:08:00.834\ntypes of algorithms maybe would\nbe a good way to say this.\n\n147\n00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:04.163\nAnd that is gonna be transposition,\nand substitution.\n\n148\n00:08:04.163 --> 00:08:08.390\nThese are a couple of methods that we use,\nwithin these ciphers.\n\n149\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.779\nUsually an algorithm is either\ntransposition algorithm, or\n\n150\n00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:13.710\na substitution algorithm.\n\n151\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.568\nAnd within a cipher, we can definitely\nuse a combination of these.\n\n152\n00:08:17.568 --> 00:08:21.670\nJust important, we understand those terms\nand what those mean, transposition and\n\n153\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.250\nsubstitution.\n\n154\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.800\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n155\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.470\nI wrote up a couple examples,\nit's easier to see I think,\n\n156\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.030\nthan to me try to verbalize it completely.\n\n157\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.310\nWe talk about transposition,\n\n158\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.870\nwe're just swapping the order\nbasically of the letters, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.300\nAnd it's important we understand that\nwe're just rearranging the order,\n\n160\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.690\nwe're not substituting one letter for\nanother because, guess what that would be?\n\n161\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.380\nCorrect, that would be a substitution\nmethod which we're gonna talk\n\n162\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.300\nabout in a second.\n\n163\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.750\nSo transposition, you're just rearranging,\nyou're shuffling the letters around.\n\n164\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.820\nLike I have this first sentence here.\n\n165\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.900\nThis is an example of\na transposition cipher.\n\n166\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.440\nAnd then what I have done below that,\nis you can see, this is the word this.\n\n167\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.830\nBackwards, right?\n\n168\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.950\nSo I reverse the order of the letters.\n\n169\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.860\nThen I went to the second word and\ndid the same thing, the third word,\n\n170\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.920\nthe fourth word.\n\n171\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.340\nIt's the same letters, just backwards\nin a different order, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.140\nOn this last line,\nI actually did it to the whole sentence,\n\n173\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.370\nwhere this is an example.\n\n174\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.170\nSo not only are the individual\nwords flipped, but\n\n175\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.720\nthe entire sentence is flipped as well.\n\n176\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.370\nAgain, transposition, I'm just shuffling\nthe order that the letters apear.\n\n177\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.510\n&gt;&gt; At its basic level,\nI'm gonna go music on you here.\n\n178\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.390\nIt seems like it's an anagram,\nif I could say that right.\n\n179\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.175\nFor instance Jim Morrison's name,\nyou will make an anagram out of it,\n\n180\n00:09:42.175 --> 00:09:44.744\nit would be Mr. Mojo Rising, right?\n\n181\n00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:47.023\nSame characters,\nsame letters in his name, but\n\n182\n00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:50.660\nthe way he arranged it around is\na little bit different of replacement.\n\n183\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and if you don't\nknow what transposition was used,\n\n184\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.740\nthen it becomes difficult for\nyou to get that original text back out.\n\n185\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.110\nYou also have to keep in mind,\nwhen you think, well, that's silly,\n\n186\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.430\nI could look at this and figure out\nwhat it was in just a few minutes.\n\n187\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.440\nWell it all started way back right,\nancient days.\n\n188\n00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.830\nAnd a lot of people couldn't read and\nwrite.\n\n189\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.370\nIt was a very, not too many people\nactually could read or write.\n\n190\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.420\nSo just writing it down was actually\none form of encryption at the time.\n\n191\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.020\nAnd then you start shuffling the letters\naround and it's not your language.\n\n192\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.000\nIt becomes very, very difficult.\n\n193\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.140\nSo keep that in mind when we look at this.\n\n194\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.430\nAnd then today.\n\n195\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.180\nIs this used?\n\n196\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.920\nAbsolutely, but it's usually used\nin combination with several other\n\n197\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.550\nmethods all combined together, right.\n\n198\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.370\nWe'll throw in transposition.\n\n199\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.890\nWe'll do a round of transposition and\nthen two rounds of substitution.\n\n200\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.570\nAnd another round of transposition and\nthen two more rounds of substitution.\n\n201\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.270\nThat might be the actual cipher, right.\n\n202\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.630\nWe got multiple algorithms going on,\nshuffling this around.\n\n203\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.420\nSo, again, don't think of this as wow,\nthat's easy.\n\n204\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.730\nAnybody could break that.\n\n205\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.890\nWe just need to understand the terms,\n\n206\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.740\nunderstand that it's implemented\nin a much more complex way.\n\n207\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.580\nAlso too,\nnormally the spaces are taken out.\n\n208\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.900\nI've left spaces in here just so\n\n209\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.110\nwe can kind of see that example backwards,\nall right.\n\n210\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:16.170\nBut normally the punctuation spaces are\nremoved when this process is done as well.\n\n211\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.697\nSo it's just a string of characters\nwhich makes it even more\n\n212\n00:11:18.697 --> 00:11:21.170\ndifficult to try to figure out,\nwhere does one word end and\n\n213\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.785\nthen next one begin that I\ncan flip it around, right?\n\n214\n00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:25.955\nSo it does become more difficult.\n\n215\n00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:31.235\nAnd then substitution is just\nthe act of substituting one letter,\n\n216\n00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:32.855\none character for another.\n\n217\n00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:35.011\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a letter.\n\n218\n00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:37.455\nIt can actually be groups\nof letters as well.\n\n219\n00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.040\nDifferent substitution methods.\n\n220\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.379\nI've seen worked at the phonetic\nlevel rather than at an individual\n\n221\n00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.605\ncharacter level.\n\n222\n00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:46.370\nSo there is lots of different\nways to implement this.\n\n223\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.600\nBut if it's basic,\n\n224\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.890\nwe're just talking about substituting\none character for another.\n\n225\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.270\nI'll give you some examples\nhere in just a second.\n\n226\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.810\nI'll throw one out right now.\n\n227\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.830\nThe Caesar Cipher is probably\none that we've heard of.\n\n228\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.240\nIt's basically shifting three spaces.\n\n229\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.430\nSo an a, b, c, d and a becomes a d, right?\n\n230\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.179\nA b, c, d, e becomes an e,\nI have to do that really quick in my head.\n\n231\n00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:14.975\nWe're just shifting over three spots and\nthat's what I've done in this second\n\n232\n00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:18.066\nexample that you see on the screen,\nthe word this.\n\n233\n00:12:18.066 --> 00:12:23.209\nWell the first letter t, u,\nv, w, so it becomes a w.\n\n234\n00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:26.970\nAnd h,i, j, k becomes a k.\n\n235\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.413\nSo this would be my encrypted text or\nmy ciphertext.\n\n236\n00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:36.210\nThis would be my plain text,\nthrow back a couple terms we've learned\n\n237\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.025\njust a little bit ago using\na substitution algorithm.\n\n238\n00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:44.328\nAnd of course we can change up what we\ncalled, when I said shifted three letters,\n\n239\n00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:45.290\nthat's the key.\n\n240\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.610\nThe key, in this case, would be three.\n\n241\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.040\nBut if you don't know the key,\nthen it becomes more difficult for\n\n242\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.890\nyou to try reverse engineer it.\n\n243\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.970\nAgain, seems simple.\n\n244\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.960\nYou can probably figure out\nwhat I was writing here,\n\n245\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.860\njust given the cipher text and told it\nwas a substitution algorithm being used,\n\n246\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.190\nyou could probably figure\nit out relatively easily.\n\n247\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.880\nBut if you don't know the key, that's what\nstarts to make it a little more difficult.\n\n248\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.480\nAll right, let's talk about,\nwhen we talk about substitution ciphers,\n\n249\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.430\none other thing I wanna mention here is,\nin fact, let me do a couple of examples.\n\n250\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.210\nWhen we talk about it like a caesar\ncipher is an example of what we call\n\n251\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:32.310\na mono-alphabetic substitution algorithm,\nright.\n\n252\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.700\nI think I said cipher again.\n\n253\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.778\nYou can see even the name, Caesar Cypher\ntechnically by my definition,\n\n254\n00:13:37.778 --> 00:13:41.810\nit would be an algorithm not a cipher, but\nyou can see how we interchange those and\n\n255\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.310\nwhy it gets so confusing.\n\n256\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.170\nAnd I don't expect any exam to say, what\nis the difference between a cipher and\n\n257\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.010\nan algorithm, I hopefully.\n\n258\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.770\nBut anyway,\nback to we're we talking about here.\n\n259\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.610\nSo your Caesar Cipher is what we\nwould call a monoalphabetic cipher.\n\n260\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:14:01.032\nMeaning there's really only one character\nset being used and we just shifted over.\n\n261\n00:14:01.032 --> 00:14:06.500\nAnd in this case showing you Caesar Cipher\nbecause supposedly Julius Caesar used this\n\n262\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.030\nback in the day and did it three spaces,\nhe would shift over three spaces.\n\n263\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.395\nSo an A becomes a D,\na B becomes an E, etc, etc.\n\n264\n00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:18.734\nSo we would take this,\nif this is what we are trying to encrypt,\n\n265\n00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:23.161\nlet's see if we can do that real quick in\nour heads, and, and S becomes what there?\n\n266\n00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:26.640\nV and an I becomes an L,\n\n267\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.860\nwe've got an M becomes a P.\n\n268\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.500\nHopefully you guys are looking at\nthe chart up there at the top, and\n\n269\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.370\nseeing how I'm doing that.\n\n270\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.679\nThe next letter is a P,\nI'll show you a P becomes an S.\n\n271\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.924\nI can get back in there.\n\n272\n00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:45.050\nI don't know if I need to\ndo the whole example here.\n\n273\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.330\nHopefully, you guys get the idea.\n\n274\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.120\nIt's just tedious watching\nme slowly go through this.\n\n275\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.650\nSo just taking one letter a time,\nsubstituting it using this chart.\n\n276\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.600\nNow, could we shift it four spots?\n\n277\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.260\nAbsolutely.\n\n278\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.955\nWe could do, four would be.\n\n279\n00:14:57.955 --> 00:15:00.150\nAn e, an f, g, oops.\n\n280\n00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:07.420\nTyping skills are lacking here today,\ng, h, i, j,\n\n281\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.620\nk, l, m, n, o, p.\n\n282\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.772\nQ, r, s, t, ,u, v, and\n\n283\n00:15:16.772 --> 00:15:22.156\nw, x, Y, z, a, b, c, d.\n\n284\n00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:25.786\nAll right, there we go, now I've got a 4,\na substitution site for\n\n285\n00:15:25.786 --> 00:15:27.200\nusing a key of 4, right?\n\n286\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.668\nCuz we're gonna shift\nover four characters.\n\n287\n00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:34.720\nAlso understand what this is that\nreally say there's only 26 letters\n\n288\n00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.220\nIn the alphabet and so, if I shift 26\nplaces, an a is right back to an a, right.\n\n289\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.970\nSo that's not gonna do me much good.\n\n290\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.380\nIt's really what they would call a modulo.\n\n291\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:52.061\nA year, let's say I did a key of 35.\n\n292\n00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:56.748\nWell, 35 would be 26 which is right\nback to the beginning, 27, 28, 29,\n\n293\n00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:01.324\n30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,\nI'm really only shifting nine spots.\n\n294\n00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:07.770\nSo, a key of 9 and a key of 35 would give\nme the same results, does that make sense?\n\n295\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.610\nCuz 135 would be wrapping back around and\ndoing 9 more shifts.\n\n296\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.370\nSo in this case we only\nhave 26 possibilities, or\n\n297\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.899\n25 possibilities as far as\nhow many spots were shifting.\n\n298\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.630\nWe can make it little more complex, and\nI misspelled his name down there and\n\n299\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.210\nI mispronounce it all the time.\n\n300\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.480\nOops, got my caps lock on there.\n\n301\n00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.790\nLets make sure we spell his name right.\n\n302\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.370\nSpecially since I can't pronounce\nit very well, it's French.\n\n303\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.740\nVisionaire or Visionaire, depending on\n\n304\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.168\nwhich dictionary you're using to help\nyou pronounce this name but it's French.\n\n305\n00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:48.224\nAnd this [INAUDIBLE] has given credit for\ndeveloping this system and it's basically\n\n306\n00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:54.150\nwhat we would call a polyalphabetic\nsubstitution cipher or algorithm.\n\n307\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.980\nIn meaning that there's more\nthen one copy of the alphabet or\n\n308\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.750\ncharacter sets being used.\n\n309\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.550\nAnd across the top,\nwe have what's known as the key.\n\n310\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.210\nAnd across the side we\nhave our plain text.\n\n311\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.120\nAnd what you do is you take your,\n\n312\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.060\nyou've got your plain text is\nthe message that you want to encrypt.\n\n313\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.770\nAnd then you have a key,\nand that can be anything.\n\n314\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:23.250\nIt can be the word red, the word blue,\ncipher, I love ITProTV.\n\n315\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.300\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n316\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.210\nThe key here, lets not use\nthe word to help to find the word.\n\n317\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.810\nThe important thing here\nis that the key is at least\n\n318\n00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.760\nas long as the data you\nare trying to encrypt.\n\n319\n00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.340\nRight, so in my case its defiantly not, so\n\n320\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.240\nwhat we would do is we would just\nrepeat the key, over and over\n\n321\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:52.560\nuntil it was as long or longer than\nthe data that you were trying to encrypt.\n\n322\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.292\nRight, then you take the first\nletter of the key which is a C.\n\n323\n00:17:56.292 --> 00:18:00.439\nAll right, that would be this column here\n\n324\n00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:05.150\ncuz I am looking in the key right here and\nI'm finding the letter C.\n\n325\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:11.230\nAnd the first letter in the plain\ntext is an S, which is right here.\n\n326\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:16.160\nSo where the S and\nthe C columns intersect, I get a U.\n\n327\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.480\nSo that is gonna be the first\nletter in my cipher text.\n\n328\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.320\nThen the next second\nletter in the key is an I.\n\n329\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.380\nSecond letter in the plain text is an I.\n\n330\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.690\nSo we find the I column here,\nwe find the I column here,\n\n331\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.485\nthey intersect and we get a Q, all right?\n\n332\n00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:43.075\nSo then the second letter would be AQ and\nso on and so forth.\n\n333\n00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:44.365\nAgain, I won't take you to this.\n\n334\n00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.315\nIt can be tedious, right?\n\n335\n00:18:45.315 --> 00:18:48.195\nThere are definitely computer\nsystems that can do this for\n\n336\n00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:51.910\nus, formulas that we can create\nthat would do the same thing.\n\n337\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.165\nSo that we see how it's working, it's\nimportant we understand what's going on.\n\n338\n00:18:56.165 --> 00:18:58.235\nBut you're just taking\nthe first letter in the key,\n\n339\n00:18:58.235 --> 00:19:02.340\nthe first letter in your plain text,\nfinding where those two intersect and\n\n340\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.310\nthat is your cipher text character,\nthen you move to the second letter.\n\n341\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:12.260\nAnd now you can see why the key has to be\nas long or longer than your plain text.\n\n342\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.850\nBecause I have to be able to, when I get\nto the eighth letter in the plain text,\n\n343\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.530\nthere better be an eighth\nletter in my key, right,\n\n344\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.190\ntelling me which column to look for,\nwhere they intersect.\n\n345\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:29.280\nSo that's the Visionaire or\nyeah,I'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\n346\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.740\nHopefully I didn't slaughter\nthat French name too badly, so\n\n347\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.490\nthat people write in and\ntell me how bad my French is.\n\n348\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.160\nAll right, so a couple of examples\nof substitution ciphers and\n\n349\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.568\nalso I have an example of a transposition\ncipher that's kinda cool.\n\n350\n00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:47.630\nI went on to Wikipedia to find this\nreal quick, it's known as a Scytale.\n\n351\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.070\nThis was used again way back ancient Greek\ndays, I think they say somewhere on this\n\n352\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:58.880\nwebpage talking about\nsomewhere around 50 to 120 AD.\n\n353\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.560\nPretty cool, one the fact that they\nwere doing encryption way back when,\n\n354\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.830\nbut as soon as we have,\nit's a good way to say this.\n\n355\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.890\nI mean, as long as we've been\nable to speak as humans,\n\n356\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.480\nwe've needed to keep information\nsecret from other people.\n\n357\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.240\nSo it really should be no surprise\nthat this stuff goes all the way back.\n\n358\n00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.830\nBut it is a cool example\nof a transposition cipher.\n\n359\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.460\nIn the fact that a scytale,\nwhat it was, was just a rod or\n\n360\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.070\na wooden dial if you will of a certain\nlength and a certain diameter.\n\n361\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.270\nAnd you take two of these and\n\n362\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.880\nyou would give one to, say the warring\nparty that was travelling out.\n\n363\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.220\nYou would keep one yourself and\nthen when you wanted to send your general\n\n364\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.560\nout there in the field a secret encoded\nmessage that nobody could read,\n\n365\n00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.420\nyou took a strip of leather or parchment\nand you wrapped it around the scytale and\n\n366\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.630\nthen you wrote across it horizontally,\nfrom left to right in our case.\n\n367\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.680\nThis way if you can follow my cursor\nthere going across at that way,\n\n368\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.250\nyou would write your message.\n\n369\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.100\nBut then when you unwrapped\nthat piece of leather\n\n370\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.630\nit was just what looked like\na strip with random letters.\n\n371\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.394\nAnd unless you had a dowel of the same\nsize, when you tried to wrap it around\n\n372\n00:21:08.394 --> 00:21:12.130\nthe letters wouldn't line up correctly and\ndifficult to decode right?\n\n373\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.950\nBut if you had a dowel of the proper size,\nif you knew or\n\n374\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.030\nthey had given you one before you left\nthen you could wrap it around there and\n\n375\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.360\nyou could get that message back out.\n\n376\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.680\nSo just another cool example\nof encryption or cryptography\n\n377\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.270\nbeing used all the way back in\nthe very early times of human history.\n\n378\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.600\nHere's another example,\n\n379\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.420\nmaybe a better one where you can see that\nthe message written out across here.\n\n380\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:41.380\nI am hurt very badly, help, right?\n\n381\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.930\nBut when you unwrap this piece of leather,\n\n382\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.470\nthis is what the leather\nactually look like, right?\n\n383\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.350\nAnd until you wrapped it back around\nyou couldn't get that message back out.\n\n384\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.860\nSo pretty cool, again for this exam,\nI don't see them really getting you on\n\n385\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.190\nreal details on how these\nencryption methods work.\n\n386\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.940\nAnd we do have some more that I\nwanted to show you and talk about.\n\n387\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.960\nBut for now for this particular episode\nkeep in mind that when we talk about\n\n388\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:09.070\nencryption we're trying to hide data or\nkeep it from being\n\n389\n00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.470\nexposed to unauthorized people by\nencrypting it only if you're authorized if\n\n390\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.570\nyou have the decryption information\ncan you get the information back out,\n\n391\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.220\nwhich gives you that confidentiality.\n\n392\n00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.850\nWe also talked about\ntwo different methods.\n\n393\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.000\nWe talked about the transposition\nmethod and the substitution method.\n\n394\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.350\nTwo common methods used within\nour encryption algorithms.\n\n395\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.480\nThat's a lot of great information\non cryptology Mike and\n\n396\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.360\nI know that we do have\na little bit more to go.\n\n397\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.680\nWe've got some ciphers and algorithms\nthat we're gonna talk about however it\n\n398\n00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.120\ndoes look like we're coming to the end of\nanother episode, but before we do Mike,\n\n399\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.250\ndo you have any additional things\nyou'd like to throw into this one, or\n\n400\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.650\nwe're gonna go for another Mike Rodrick,\nI was gonna say cliff hanger?\n\n401\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we'll leave them hanging\nsince we get another episode coming.\n\n402\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a great place\nto go ahead and wrap it up,\n\n403\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.060\nMike as always we appreciate having you\nhere and we appreciate you out there,\n\n404\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.000\nthe viewer for watching, signing out for\nITProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n405\n00:22:56.000 -->

00:00:08.232\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.210\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting episode\nhere at ITProTV, I'm your host,\n\n6\n00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.490\nWes Bryant.\n\n7\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.340\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nto our GIACs Security [LAUGH] Essentials,\n\n8\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.210\nif I can say it right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.445\nLet me make it a little easier.\n\n10\n00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.190\nG-Sec essentials,\n\n11\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.700\nwe're actually continuing through\ncryptology fundamentals, part two.\n\n12\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.290\nAnd joining us back in the studio for\nthis very endeavor, is none other than Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.885\nMike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:33.975\nMike, how you doing today sir?\n\n15\n00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:38.530\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, and it is about full\nso I'm glad you have to say it and not me.\n\n16\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.165\n[LAUGH] But we are,\nwe're continuing on with our cryptography\n\n17\n00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.102\nfundamentals we were talking\nabout in a previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:45.942\nSome of the basics.\n\n19\n00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:50.942\nWe talked about transposition\nversus substitution.\n\n20\n00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:53.682\nI gave you a couple examples\nof each one of those.\n\n21\n00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.322\nSo we've got that under our belt.\n\n22\n00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:58.062\nWe talked about why we would\nencrypt in the first place.\n\n23\n00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:00.462\nTo get that confidentiality, primarily.\n\n24\n00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:05.602\nBut that encryption also provides\nintegrity as well as non-repudiation,\n\n25\n00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.102\nwhich is one that a lot of\npeople will forget about.\n\n26\n00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:09.910\nSo given an exam, or\n\n27\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.240\ngiven a question on an exam that\nsays what does cryptography provide?\n\n28\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.130\nOr what does encryption provide you?\n\n29\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.820\nAnd you have to check all that apply.\n\n30\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.010\nA lot of people will chose\nthe confidentiality because\n\n31\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.190\nthat's the obvious one.\n\n32\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.630\nDon't forget about data integrity and\nnon-repudiation, all right.\n\n33\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.630\nSo now I want to talk a little bit\nmore about types of encryption.\n\n34\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.580\nAnd this is more about methodology\nthat these algorithms will use.\n\n35\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.880\nWe talked about transposition,\n\n36\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.220\nI can't say that one today, transposition,\nI have to slow down, and substitution.\n\n37\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.860\nNow, I want to talk about\nstream versus block ciphers.\n\n38\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.670\nBecause while transposition is what's\ngoing on inside the algorithm, it's\n\n39\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.990\nswitching letters around or substitution\nit's substituting one letter for another,\n\n40\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.260\nstream and block refers to how the data,\nthe plain text is fed in the algorithm.\n\n41\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.400\nOr how that algorithm is set\nup top accept plain text so\n\n42\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.790\nthat it can churn on it, grind on it,\nand output that cypher text.\n\n43\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.295\nA stream cypher is one in where\neach bit goes in one at a time,\n\n44\n00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:18.620\nit's like a nice little row,\nall the bits line up and\n\n45\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.860\nthey're just waiting in line,\none in, one in, one in.\n\n46\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.050\nAnd you can imagine like a box,\nif you will.\n\n47\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.310\nWhere this encryption\nalgorithm is occurring.\n\n48\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.210\nAnd there's a front door and\nthere's a back door.\n\n49\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.850\nAnd in the front door,\none bit at a time's marching in.\n\n50\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.880\nIt's doing some magic\nto it inside that box.\n\n51\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.300\nAnd out the backside,\none little bit comes out.\n\n52\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.472\nSo every bit that comes in,\none bit goes at the back side.\n\n53\n00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:44.106\nThat's the stream cyber because you\nsending a stream of single bits\n\n54\n00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:46.980\nthrough this cypher or this algorithm.\n\n55\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.331\nA good example of a stream\ncyber would be RC4.\n\n56\n00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:55.368\nRivet cypher 4 which is one you've\nprobably heard about because it's used in\n\n57\n00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:58.684\nWEP it's used in WPA,\nit's used in several different places.\n\n58\n00:02:58.684 --> 00:03:01.082\nBut that's a good example\nof a stream cipher,\n\n59\n00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:04.480\none that we're probably all familiar with,\nat least that name.\n\n60\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.760\nThe other type is gonna be a block cipher.\n\n61\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.390\nAnd a stream cipher, one bit at a time.\n\n62\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.400\nA block cipher,\nworks at a block of bits at a time.\n\n63\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.070\nSo it's taking a chunk,\na fixed sized chunk, usually 64 bits or\n\n64\n00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.480\nsomething similar,\ndepending on the algorithm itself.\n\n65\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.270\nIt'd take a block of 64 and it works on\nthe entire block as a unit basically and\n\n66\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.000\nthen spits a block out the back end.\n\n67\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.950\nAll right?\n\n68\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.820\nSo the stream, one bit at a time,\nblock a chunk of bits at a time.\n\n69\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.410\nA couple of other things we should be\nfamiliar with these two type stream\n\n70\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.510\nverses block.\n\n71\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.000\nTalk about a stream one bit at a time.\n\n72\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.970\nOne of the good things about\na stream is it's pretty fast,\n\n73\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.380\nbecause you're dealing\nwith one bit at a time.\n\n74\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.450\nPretty easy to perform a calculation\non it, spit it out the back side,\n\n75\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.910\nnext bit comes in, keeps on going.\n\n76\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.495\nSo, relatively quick, or light weight,\nas far as the processing power goes.\n\n77\n00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:01.240\nDownside, one of the downsides\nof stream cyphers,\n\n78\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.010\nthough, is repeatability, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.060\nAnd, when we talk about\nencryption of any kind.\n\n80\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.380\nPatterns are evil when\nit comes to encryption.\n\n81\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.120\nAny type of pattern is a bad thing, cuz\nwhen we talk about reversing encryption,\n\n82\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.170\nthat's where we start is we look for\npatterns, right.\n\n83\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.490\nIf you think about some of those\ntransposition cyphers or, even better,\n\n84\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.960\nthose substitution cyphers\nwe were looking at,\n\n85\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.590\nhow are you gonna break\nthat substitution cypher?\n\n86\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.280\nYou start looking for patterns, right?\n\n87\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.570\nYou start recognizing that there's\n\n88\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.990\ntwo of a particular letter\ntogether in several words.\n\n89\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.350\nWell there's not that many letters,\nif it's English, for example.\n\n90\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.850\nThere's not that many letters that we\ncan use two of together like that, or\n\n91\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.070\ncommon words, three letter words.\n\n92\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.880\nSo any type of pattern that we\ncan discern from that cypher text\n\n93\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.558\ncan help me break it and\ntry to get it back into plain text.\n\n94\n00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:57.590\nWith stream cyphers,\nbecause it's doing one bit at a time,\n\n95\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.530\nif that bit that goes in is a one,\nyou see what I'm saying, it's going to be\n\n96\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.648\nvery similar every time it works on\nthat type of bit of information.\n\n97\n00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:11.940\nSo streams can present more\npatterns than say a block.\n\n98\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.760\nWhen I'm working on a block of\ninformation at a time much less likely to\n\n99\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.680\nproduce any patterns\nbecause what's the odds of\n\n100\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.570\nthis email I'm sending having\ntwo blocks that are identical?\n\n101\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.170\nRight, not nearly as much as\nif I'm doing with a stream.\n\n102\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.030\nSo blocks are a little\nmore secure in that way,\n\n103\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.890\nbut also blocks have an issue with\ntaking much more processing power to do.\n\n104\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.710\nThe other thing we have\nto deal with blocks is\n\n105\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.910\nwhat if there's not enough bits,\nall right?\n\n106\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.424\nIf I said you're using 64\nbit chunks of data, and\n\n107\n00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:47.265\nyou've got 140 bits in your\ninformation that you need to encrypt.\n\n108\n00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:51.840\n64, 64's, 128, that leaves me, what, 12?\n\n109\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.630\nThat's not enough for that third block.\n\n110\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.390\nSo now what?\n\n111\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.680\nI've gotta fill that block with what\nthey call padding to get it up to 64,\n\n112\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.500\nbecause the algorithm is\nexpecting chunks of 64.\n\n113\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.560\nIt can't do 12 bits.\n\n114\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.920\nHas to have 64.\n\n115\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.350\nAnd with that padding, now we can\nstart introducing patterns in there.\n\n116\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.000\nSo again, it goes back to patterns\nare bad when it comes to encryption.\n\n117\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.920\nBut for this exam again,\n\n118\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.000\nthe big thing I want you to understand is\nthe difference between a stream cypher,\n\n119\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.300\na one bit at a time versus a block cypher,\nchunks of bits at a time.\n\n120\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.370\nAnd then examples of RC4 be a great\nexample of a stream cypher.\n\n121\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.530\nTriple desk is a good\nexample of a block cipher.\n\n122\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.480\nAES, the Advanced Encryption Standard\nis another\n\n123\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.749\nexample of a block cypher that I'm sure\nwe've seen out there in the real world.\n\n124\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.400\nAll right, so stream, block.\n\n125\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.180\nWe also have what we call algorithm types.\n\n126\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.130\nAnd again, little bit confusing here.\n\n127\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.780\nAlgorithm methods, algorithm types,\nI wouldn't worry too much about that.\n\n128\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.800\nBut understand the difference\nbetween stream and block.\n\n129\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.360\nAlso we need to understand the difference\nbetween symmetric, asymmetric and\n\n130\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.440\nhashish all right?\n\n131\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.420\nThis is what they call\nalgorithm types [COUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:09.370\nAnd when we talk about this, it's really\nall about, what's a good way to say this?\n\n133\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.790\nIt is about the keying information as far\nas the difference between symmetric and\n\n134\n00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.280\nasymmetric, right?\n\n135\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.400\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n136\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.760\nWhen we talk about symmetric encryption,\n\n137\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.680\nwe're talking about an encryption\nalgorithm that only has one key.\n\n138\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.580\nOne key does the encryption,\nthat same key does the decryption.\n\n139\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.660\nNow before we go any further,\n\n140\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.720\nI just realized, we really didn't\ntalk about what a key was.\n\n141\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.005\nSo lets talk about that real quick.\n\n142\n00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:37.763\nIt's interesting with\nthese algorithms we use,\n\n143\n00:07:37.763 --> 00:07:39.865\nhow we can all use the same algorithm,\n\n144\n00:07:39.865 --> 00:07:44.084\nbecause there's really not that many\nthat we use like in a computer system.\n\n145\n00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:48.606\nWe all use the same algorithms,\nyet I can't decrypt your stuff and\n\n146\n00:07:48.606 --> 00:07:50.867\nyou can't decrypt my stuff, and\n\n147\n00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:56.441\nthat's because along with the algorithm\nwe use something called a key All right,\n\n148\n00:07:56.441 --> 00:08:01.882\nlets jump back and think about that caesar\ncipher or that substitution cipher.\n\n149\n00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:05.207\nWhere we said the key was three so\nwe would shift three letters up\n\n150\n00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:09.460\nin the alphabet, in the English alphabet\nfor our example that we used, right?\n\n151\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.030\nAnd the key was three.\n\n152\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.950\nOr I said, we could shift five.\n\n153\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.560\nThe key would be five.\n\n154\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.410\nWell, the idea is that everybody\nknows the algorithm that we're using.\n\n155\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.120\nWe're using the Ceaser Cyper or\na substitution cyper.\n\n156\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.450\nWhat we don't know is what\nkey each other is using.\n\n157\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.000\nI might be using a key of three,\nwhereas Wes might be using a key of five.\n\n158\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.043\nAnd as long as we keep\nthat information secret,\n\n159\n00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:37.622\nthen it's gonna be more difficult for\nme to decrypt his stuff, right?\n\n160\n00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:39.207\nBecause I don't know what key he is using.\n\n161\n00:08:39.207 --> 00:08:43.585\nHe might be shifting 5, he might be\nshifting 8, he might be shifting 22.\n\n162\n00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:44.882\nI don't know.\n\n163\n00:08:44.882 --> 00:08:46.995\nNow of course that's\na relatively simple example.\n\n164\n00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:51.122\nThere's only 25 possibilities, so given\nthe processing power of today's computers\n\n165\n00:08:51.122 --> 00:08:54.986\nor even the processing power in my head,\nthey wouldn't take me that long to break.\n\n166\n00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:58.754\nBut again, simple example to\nunderstand the concept, right?\n\n167\n00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:05.460\nSo the key is something that plugs in to\nthe algorithm to make it unique for you.\n\n168\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.760\nSo that we all have different keys,\nwe can use the same algorithm, yet\n\n169\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.870\nI can't decrypt your stuff and\nyou can't decrypt my stuff,\n\n170\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.110\ncuz you don't have my key and or\nI don't have your key, make sense?\n\n171\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.720\nSo the key is what makes\nthe algorithm unique for\n\n172\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.350\nyour particular use of\nthat encryption algorithm.\n\n173\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.330\nSo a symmetric algorithms there's only\none key, in other words you take your\n\n174\n00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.730\nalgorithm, you plug this key into it,\nand you use it to encrypt your data.\n\n175\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.720\nNow I send that encrypted\ninformation to somebody.\n\n176\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720\nThey know the algorithm I used.\n\n177\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.120\nI need to give them the key that I used so\n\n178\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.900\nthey can plug that same key into the\nalgorithm, and decrypt the information.\n\n179\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.333\nSee what I'm saying?\nOne key does the encryption and\n\n180\n00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:50.040\nthe decryption.\n\n181\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.640\nThat's a symmetric algorithm also\nknown as a secret key cryptography.\n\n182\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.530\nCuz there's one key we keep it secret.\n\n183\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.700\nOnly the authorized people\nshould have access to the key.\n\n184\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.700\nCuz anybody that has the ciphertext,\nthe encrypted data,\n\n185\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.330\nthey know what algorithm was used,\nif they've got the key.\n\n186\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.650\nThey can plug it in and\nthey can decrypt the information.\n\n187\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.699\nSo the key has to be kept secret, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:18.830\nAsymmetric is where we have\nwhat is known as the key pair.\n\n189\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.450\nThere's two keys that\nare generated as a key pair.\n\n190\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.790\nThey are mathematically related and\n\n191\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.380\none key will be used during\nthe encryption process.\n\n192\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.480\nThe other key will be used to decrypt it.\n\n193\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.790\nNow it doesn't matter which one you\nreally used to do the encryption, but\n\n194\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:41.020\nwhichever one you use, the other\none has to be used to decrypt it.\n\n195\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.724\nSo let's say we call this one key,\nthis first one is key A, and\n\n196\n00:10:44.724 --> 00:10:46.160\nthe second one is key B.\n\n197\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.700\nWell if you use key A to encrypt it,\n\n198\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.590\nthen key B is the only key that\ncan be used to decrypt it.\n\n199\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.363\nIf I use key B to encrypt it,\n\n200\n00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.924\nthen the only key that can be\nused to decrypt it is key A.\n\n201\n00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.990\nYou have to have the other\nhalf of the key pair.\n\n202\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.393\nIf I use key A to encrypt it I\ncannot decrypt it with key A,\n\n203\n00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:06.864\nI have to have the other key, all right?\n\n204\n00:11:06.864 --> 00:11:08.124\nSo that's asymmetric.\n\n205\n00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:12.627\nAsymmetric meaning basically,\nnot the same on both sides.\n\n206\n00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:15.466\nSymmetric meaning the same on both sides,\nright?\n\n207\n00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.290\nWe're talking about\nthe encryption part and\n\n208\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.940\nthe decryption part as\nthe two different sides.\n\n209\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.930\nNow with asymmetric,\nthe keys are generated as a key pair.\n\n210\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.550\nThey're mathematically related.\n\n211\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.680\nBut another cool thing about that key\npair, is if you have one of the keys,\n\n212\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.470\nit's mathematically impractical,\nis our fancy way of saying,\n\n213\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.910\nalmost impossible, for\nyou to deduce what the other key is.\n\n214\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.580\nIn other words, if you have key A, if I\ngive it to you, you can't take key A And\n\n215\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.760\ngo alright I can figure out key B even\nthough I don't have it, I've got key A and\n\n216\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.150\nusing key A I can figure out what key\nB is, you're not going to, alright?\n\n217\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.875\nMathematically impractical,\nits just not possible.\n\n218\n00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:57.340\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting I got this little lock\nbox at the house and if I wanted to share\n\n219\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.240\na secret with you Mike it is got\ntwo keys on it, theoretically,\n\n220\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.900\nI could give you one of the keys and\nthen I could put the secret in there.\n\n221\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.600\nAnd I could lock that box down there,\nand just, hey Mike.\n\n222\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.340\nThrow it over to you.\nAnd if anybody else catches it,\n\n223\n00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.116\nif they don't have that key that\nI've already given you access to,\n\n224\n00:12:11.116 --> 00:12:14.330\nthen technically, they couldn't get\nin there and try to lock and open it.\n\n225\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.220\nSo I guess, on a basic level,\nis that close to what we're talking about?\n\n226\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's a very good example.\n\n227\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.248\nNow the keys are basicly strings\nof ones and zeros, right?\n\n228\n00:12:24.248 --> 00:12:28.425\nWe talk about key length,\nthat is how many bits are in the key.\n\n229\n00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:31.665\nA 64 bit key would 64, ones and zeros,\n\n230\n00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:37.262\n128 bit key would be a 128, ones and\nzeros that you are plugging in.\n\n231\n00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:42.800\nAnd the longer the key, the more,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n232\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.130\nThe stronger the algorithm is going to be.\n\n233\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.410\nBecause it's more difficult to figure out.\n\n234\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.132\nIf you've only got two bits in your key,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:50.132 --> 00:12:51.270\nWell, there's not too many possibilities.\n\n236\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.768\nYour key space,\nthe number of possible keys is very small.\n\n237\n00:12:55.768 --> 00:12:58.400\n00, 01, 10, 11.\n\n238\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.903\nBut if I have 128 bits in my key,\nthere's a lot of possibilities, right?\n\n239\n00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:07.950\n2 to the 128 as a matter of fact\nwould tell me what my key space is.\n\n240\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.680\nSo, the more possible keys there are,\nthe more difficult it is for\n\n241\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.920\na bad guy to figure out\nwhat key you're using.\n\n242\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.760\nIf I tell you there's only three keys,\nyou can try one, then try two, and\n\n243\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.330\nthen try three, and\nyou've gone through all the keys.\n\n244\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.784\nIf I tell you there's a million\nkeys in the key space,\n\n245\n00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:25.380\nit takes you a lot longer to try every\nsingle one of those keys, right?\n\n246\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.520\nSo the longer the key, when you hear them\ntalking about an encryption algorithm, and\n\n247\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.214\nthey say it uses a 256 bit key,\nnow you know what they're talking about.\n\n248\n00:13:33.214 --> 00:13:36.890\n256 1s and 0s make up that key.\n\n249\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.680\nIn order for me to guess it, I'd have\nto know exactly what pattern of 1s and\n\n250\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.690\n0s you did for all 256 bits, right?\n\n251\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.170\nNow let's go back to asymmetric because\nthere's a little more to it than what\n\n252\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.920\nwe've already talked about.\n\n253\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.980\nWe know there's two keys and\na key pair, mathematically related.\n\n254\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.730\nWhichever one I use to encrypt, the other\none has to be used to decrypt, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.740\nNow when we look at\nthese in our computers,\n\n256\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.760\nwe typically call one of them,\nour private key.\n\n257\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.907\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna color this one green here.\n\n258\n00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:10.630\nI'm sorry, we'll call that our public key,\nlet's start with public.\n\n259\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.270\nSo let me put some terms out here for us.\n\n260\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.070\nWe're gonna call this one our public key,\n\n261\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.650\nand my caps lock is evidently on,\nso let's turn that off.\n\n262\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.100\nI can spell public, I promise.\n\n263\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.474\nSo, this one will be our public key, and\n\n264\n00:14:28.474 --> 00:14:35.034\nwe will say the other one is gonna\nbe known as our private key,\n\n265\n00:14:35.034 --> 00:14:39.038\nand we're gonna color that one red.\n\n266\n00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.625\nA little Christmas theme going on,\nbecause when we shot this episode,\n\n267\n00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.430\nit was getting close to Christmas.\n\n268\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.360\nAll right.\nSo, we got a public and private key.\n\n269\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.520\nOne of the keys is known\nas your public key.\n\n270\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.340\nThe other one is known as the private key.\n\n271\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.770\nThat's why we call this type of\nencryption, public key cryptography,\n\n272\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.286\nright?\n\n273\n00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:56.650\nBecause one of the keys is called public.\n\n274\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.770\nNow, the way you handle these keys,\n\n275\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:03.590\nthe public key, you can give to\neverybody hence the name public.\n\n276\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.600\nIt's typically stored in a certificate.\n\n277\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.610\nA digital document and\nthat key is inside there.\n\n278\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.592\nAnd you can post this public key on your\nwebsite for anybody for anybody to have in\n\n279\n00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:16.465\na corporate environment, they're\ntypically stored in Active directory.\n\n280\n00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:19.682\nSo if I wanna get a hold of Wes's\npublic key, I can do that or\n\n281\n00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:20.882\nhe can email it to me.\n\n282\n00:15:20.882 --> 00:15:23.995\nIf I'm dealing with somebody\noutside of my organization,\n\n283\n00:15:23.995 --> 00:15:25.895\nI can email them my public key.\n\n284\n00:15:25.895 --> 00:15:27.085\nIt's called public for a reason.\n\n285\n00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:31.450\nWe don't care who has the public key,\nthat's why we make it public.\n\n286\n00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.186\nThe private key when at first is generated\nis stored in a secure location in your\n\n287\n00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.575\nuser profile list in a Windows system.\n\n288\n00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:42.285\nBut the private key has to remain private.\n\n289\n00:15:42.285 --> 00:15:46.674\nNobody except for\nyou gets access to your private key.\n\n290\n00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:48.925\n&gt;&gt; Well the public key Mike,\nif I'm sharing that with somebody,\n\n291\n00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:50.460\nthat's gotta be some kind of danger here.\n\n292\n00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.338\nI mean, isn't somebody in danger of seeing\nmy information if I share my public\n\n293\n00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:55.411\nkey with everybody?\n\n294\n00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:56.735\n&gt;&gt; You would think so, right?\n\n295\n00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:58.136\nBut, it doesn't.\n\n296\n00:15:58.136 --> 00:16:03.255\nIt solves one of the problems that we\nhave with symmetric encryption and\n\n297\n00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:05.680\nthat is key distribution.\n\n298\n00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.180\nAnd I think I can show you\nbetter than I can tell you, so\n\n299\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.110\nlet's a look at this next drawing here.\n\n300\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.870\nWe'll take a look at\nsome metric encryption.\n\n301\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.210\nHere I've got good old Alice and Bob.\n\n302\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.120\nThey're usually the ones you\nsee in most cryptography demos.\n\n303\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.750\nAnd Alice wants to encrypt a document and\nsend it over to Bob.\n\n304\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.060\nSo she takes her document and\n\n305\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.640\nlet's say the application she's\nusing uses symmetric encryption.\n\n306\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.710\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nit's gonna generate a key and\n\n307\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.590\nthen it's gonna use that key to,\nalong with\n\n308\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.050\nthe algorithm that's being used by this\napplication, to encrypt the document.\n\n309\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.500\nThen I'm gonna send\nthe document over to Bob.\n\n310\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.220\nIt's now encrypted.\n\n311\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.560\nI can send it across the network.\n\n312\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.430\nNow what is Bob need to\ndecrypt that document?\n\n313\n00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.561\nAll right, if that's a symmetric key,\nhe's going to need that same key, right,\n\n314\n00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:52.190\ncause it's just one key.\n\n315\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nhe needs the key that I use to encrypt, or\n\n316\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:00.040\nAlice in this case, he needs the key that\nAlice used to encrypt it, to decrypt it.\n\n317\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.810\nWell here's the problem with this,\nall right, Mr.\n\n318\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.280\nBad Guy over here happens to have access\nto our network, maybe is doing a little\n\n319\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.990\nsniffing, and he intercepts a copy\nof that encrypted document.\n\n320\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.460\nNow it's encrypted,\nhe can't read it, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.270\nBut what is Alice do next?\n\n322\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.360\nShe sends a copy of the key over to Bob.\n\n323\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.560\nWell if he intercepted,\nif the attacker intercepted the document,\n\n324\n00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.950\ngood chance the attacker is also\ngoing to intercept the key.\n\n325\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.609\nSo at this point,\ncan the attacker decrypt the document?\n\n326\n00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:31.666\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, that one key.\n\n327\n00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:34.980\nIf he's got it, then he's able to decrypt\nit and see everything that's going on.\n\n328\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, he's got the cyber text,\nhe's got the key to decrypt it.\n\n329\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.410\nHe's good to go.\n\n330\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.010\nThe attacker now has all the information\nthat Alice is trying to keep secret.\n\n331\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.470\nAnd this is why I say symmetric\nencryption algorithms\n\n332\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.470\nhave a problem with key distribution.\n\n333\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:53.680\nHow do I get the key to the other end of\nthe conversation securely, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.180\nUsually, we have to do what's called\nan out-of-band communication.\n\n335\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.370\nIf I emailed this document to Bob,\nthen I do not wanna email the key.\n\n336\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.100\nBecause f the bad guy intercepted the\nemail in the first place, I email the key.\n\n337\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.050\nHe's gonna intercept that as well.\n\n338\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.513\nSo maybe I email the document,\nbut then I call Bob and\n\n339\n00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:14.045\nI tell him what the key is, all right?\n\n340\n00:18:14.045 --> 00:18:16.766\nIn other words,\nuse a different communications channel.\n\n341\n00:18:16.766 --> 00:18:19.300\nThat's what we call\nout-of-band communications.\n\n342\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.160\nThat way,\n\n343\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.610\nhopefully the bad guy doesn't have\naccess to both communication channels.\n\n344\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.650\nHe might have broken in\nto our email system, but\n\n345\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.150\nhe's not in my VoIP system, right?\n\n346\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.640\nOr something like that, that's the idea.\n\n347\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.060\nMaybe I fax it over, all right, because\nthat's a different channel than the email.\n\n348\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.500\nBut it does become a problem\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n349\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.760\nThe good thing about symmetric\nencryption is it's really quick.\n\n350\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.800\nIt's very lightweight as\nfar as processing power.\n\n351\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.880\nSo I can encrypt bulk amounts of data,\npretty quickly,\n\n352\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.610\nwith symmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n353\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.986\nBut, again,\nthere's a problem with key distribution.\n\n354\n00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:57.440\nSo let's see how asymmetric encryption\nsolves this key distribution problem.\n\n355\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.630\nSame scenario, Alice is going to\nsend an encrypted data over to Bob.\n\n356\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:08.160\nSo, she is going to want to encrypt\nthis information before she sends it.\n\n357\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.760\nBoth users have a key pair.\n\n358\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.950\nThey've been issued by\ntheir administration,\n\n359\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.980\nby their network a key pair.\n\n360\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.240\nSo Alice has her certificate\nwhich includes her public key and\n\n361\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.930\nher matching private key.\n\n362\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.340\nBob has his certificate with his public\nkey and his matching private key.\n\n363\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.688\nThat key pair over there.\n\n364\n00:19:25.688 --> 00:19:29.439\nWhat Alice is gonna do\nis not use her keys.\n\n365\n00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:33.547\nAlice is gonna get a hold of Bob's\npublic key, because its public,\n\n366\n00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:34.780\nanybody can get it.\n\n367\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.524\nShe can call bob and say hey I want\nto send you something encrypted,\n\n368\n00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:38.656\nsend me your certificate.\n\n369\n00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:40.018\nHe emails it to her.\n\n370\n00:19:40.018 --> 00:19:42.351\nShe now inputs that into her application.\n\n371\n00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:45.217\nShe hits a drop down list or\nwhatever the application makes her do,\n\n372\n00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:48.290\nto pick the certificate to use\nto encrypt the information.\n\n373\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.780\nAnd so now the information is encrypted,\nwith Bob's public key.\n\n374\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.030\nAnd then she sends\nthe document over to Bob.\n\n375\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.720\nNow, if I use Bob's\npublic key to encrypt it,\n\n376\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.980\nwhat key do I need to decrypt it?\n\n377\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.988\nWhat do you think, Wes?\n\n378\n00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:07.187\n&gt;&gt; I would say the only\nother key that's left,\n\n379\n00:20:07.187 --> 00:20:10.790\nthe one that you said has to be kept\nprivate, hence the private key.\n\n380\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.670\n&gt;&gt; The private key, and\nit has to be Bob's private key, and\n\n381\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.190\nnot my private key, right?\n\n382\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.230\nBecause this is a key pair,\nBob's public key and\n\n383\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.090\nprivate key work together mathematically.\n\n384\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.540\nSo I used Bob's public key to encrypt it.\n\n385\n00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.260\nBob is gonna have to have his\nown private key to decrypt it.\n\n386\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.610\nWho has Bob's private key?\n\n387\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Only Bob, right?\n\n388\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.550\n&gt;&gt; If he's done his job,\nthen only Bob, exactly right.\n\n389\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:39.200\nSo Alice doesn't have to send the key\nnecessary to decrypt the information.\n\n390\n00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.088\nBob already has it.\n\n391\n00:20:40.088 --> 00:20:44.770\nSo here, Mr. attacker says, you know what,\nI intercepted a copy of that document.\n\n392\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.750\nSo he's got an encrypted\ncopy of the document.\n\n393\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.900\nBut the key never comes across the wire.\n\n394\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.410\nThere's no chance for\n\n395\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.465\nthe attacker to intercept the key\nbecause it was never sent.\n\n396\n00:20:55.465 --> 00:21:00.030\nSo we've solved the problem, therefore\nof key distribution using a public key\n\n397\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.903\ncryptography,asymmetric encryption method.\n\n398\n00:21:02.903 --> 00:21:06.466\n&gt;&gt; And now that makes sense, so\nmy question,why wouldn't that\n\n399\n00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:10.176\nmake it unsecure, you know,\nif I have access to the public key.\n\n400\n00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:12.865\nCuz it's only doing the encryption\nin the first place, so,\n\n401\n00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:16.680\nit's not really gonna hurt anybody if they\nhas it, cuz that's the worst they can do.\n\n402\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.542\nRe-encrypt and encrypted document.\n\n403\n00:21:19.542 --> 00:21:22.370\nWhich will fail the decryption process-\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n404\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.250\nthat's the thing about it if\neverybody there watching this\n\n405\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.700\ngot a hold f the public key, which you can\nI will give it to you anytime yo want it.\n\n406\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.750\nAnd yo encrypt all your stuff with it.\n\n407\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.850\nGuess what,\n\n408\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.410\nI can now read all your stuff because I\nhave your private key that goes with it.\n\n409\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.550\nYou can't even decrypt your stuff\nbecause you don't have my private key.\n\n410\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.340\nSo it will be silly for you for you to\ntry to steal my public key and try and\n\n411\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.450\ntry to encrypt a bunch of stuff, right?\n\n412\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.070\nSo that's the cool thing about asymmetric.\n\n413\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.380\nNow, there are some downsides\nto asymmetric as well.\n\n414\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.720\nIt's much more computationally,\nif I say that correctly, intensive.\n\n415\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.200\nIt takes a lot more processing\npower to run through this\n\n416\n00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.380\nasymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n417\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.270\nSo they tend to be a little bit slower\nas far as doing the encryption,\n\n418\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.850\nespecially with bulk amounts of data.\n\n419\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.668\nSo actually,\n\n420\n00:22:06.668 --> 00:22:10.768\na lot of places they a combination of\nwhich will come to here in a second.\n\n421\n00:22:10.768 --> 00:22:15.108\nBut hopefully that makes sense as far as\nthe difference between asymmetric and\n\n422\n00:22:15.108 --> 00:22:18.920\nsymmetric and it's not typically\nsomething that we pick per se, but\n\n423\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.848\nif we're buying an application.\n\n424\n00:22:20.848 --> 00:22:23.213\nAnd we need this application\nto secure information.\n\n425\n00:22:23.213 --> 00:22:26.007\nWe might wanna take a look at\nthe text specs of the application and\n\n426\n00:22:26.007 --> 00:22:29.190\nsay, this is using symmetric,\nmaybe I'm not too happy with that.\n\n427\n00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.040\nOr maybe, for our purposes,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n428\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.530\nIt's usually the application is\nhard-coded to use a particular algorithm.\n\n429\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.130\nAnd that algorithm is either symmetric or\nasymmetric.\n\n430\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.680\nIt's not something we can say,\ntoday I wanna do symmetric.\n\n431\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.800\nTomorrow I'm gonna do\nthe same application.\n\n432\n00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.560\nBut I wanna do asymmetric.\n\n433\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.650\nSo, it's typically picked tokyo by that's\nperson that's writing the code for\n\n434\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.930\nthe application, or webpage, or\nwhatever it is that we're trying to do.\n\n435\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.210\nAll right, so\nthat's asymmetric and symmetric.\n\n436\n00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.870\nlet's talk about a digital signature now.\n\n437\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.220\nAll right?\n\n438\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.850\nA digital signature is a what's\na good way to say this?\n\n439\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.880\nYou know, it is a way that I can\nprovide non-repudiation, right?\n\n440\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.820\nWe do this a lot of time with emails.\n\n441\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.340\nOur email application\ngives us the option to\n\n442\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.460\ncheck a little check mark to\ninclude a digital signature.\n\n443\n00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.440\nWell, what is that\ndigital signature doing?\n\n444\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.740\nOr how is it working?\n\n445\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.780\nIt's actually using asymmetric encryption,\nbut\n\n446\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.320\nit's doing it a little differently\nthan what we just talked about.\n\n447\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.500\nWhen you add a signature to a document,\nand\n\n448\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.160\nlet me zoom in just a wee\nbit here on this drawing.\n\n449\n00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.770\nWhen you add, to a document we're\ngonna view a very high level overview,\n\n450\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.650\nnot gonna get too detailed here.\n\n451\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.460\nBut what's happening is\nthe application is gonna use,\n\n452\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.670\nlet's say Alice is trying\nto digitally sign an email.\n\n453\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:50.077\nThat application is gonna use Alice's\nprivate key to encrypt the signature.\n\n454\n00:23:50.077 --> 00:23:52.015\nThe signature is actually a hash value,\n\n455\n00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:54.530\nwhich we're gonna talk about\nhere in just a second.\n\n456\n00:23:54.530 --> 00:24:00.857\nBut it signs it By using her private\nkey to encrypt that signature.\n\n457\n00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:03.190\nIt's like wow, that's kind of crazy.\n\n458\n00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.930\nI thought it was the public\nkey that does the encryption.\n\n459\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.040\nRemember what I said,\neither key can encrypt.\n\n460\n00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.150\nJust has to be the other key\nto do the decryption, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.990\nSo in this case,\nwe encrypt it with the private key.\n\n462\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.090\nNow we send it over to Bob.\n\n463\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.527\nWell, if Bob wants to decrypt that\nsignature and Alice used her private key\n\n464\n00:24:23.527 --> 00:24:27.691\nto encrypt it in the first place,\nwhat key has to be used to decrypt it?\n\n465\n00:24:27.691 --> 00:24:30.420\nThat would be Alice's public key.\n\n466\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.770\nIf her private key encrypted it,\nthe other half of the key pair,\n\n467\n00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.620\nher public key,\nwill be used to decrypt it.\n\n468\n00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.450\nSo Bob gets her certificate,\ngets her public key and\n\n469\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.790\nsuccessfully decrypts the signature.\n\n470\n00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:49.200\nWhich means if her public key\nsuccessfully decrypted the signature,\n\n471\n00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.830\nthen it had to be encrypted in\nthe first place with her private key.\n\n472\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.350\nCuz those were a key pair.\n\n473\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:25:00.010\nSo if the public key decrypts it, then it\nhad to be encrypted with the private key.\n\n474\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.380\nWho's the only one that\nhas Alice's private key?\n\n475\n00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.100\nAlice.\n\n476\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.650\nSo Alice is the only one that could\nhave signed that document, right?\n\n477\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.580\nThat's non-repudiation by using her\npublic key to decrypt the signature.\n\n478\n00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.160\nI can verify that was her\nprivate key that was used to\n\n479\n00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.435\ncreate the signature in the first place.\n\n480\n00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:17.690\nTherefore, I can prove it came from Alice.\n\n481\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Now let me put a rewind on the whole\nentire episode, part one and part two, and\n\n482\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.900\nlet's go,\nI'm not gonna do the backwards sound here.\n\n483\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.810\nAnd let's go all the way\nback to what you first said.\n\n484\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.000\nYou said that with encryption,\nwe get confidentiality.\n\n485\n00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.170\nYou've already mentioned what they are,\nintegrity.\n\n486\n00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.250\nYou said the other one\nwas non-repudiation.\n\n487\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.350\nI can verify that it has to be the person\nthat I thought it came from and\n\n488\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.970\nis this an example where I can verify?\n\n489\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.930\nIt had to be Alice in this case.\n\n490\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:42.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n491\n00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.000\nNow I do want to back up just for\na second because while I say,\n\n492\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.920\nit had to be Alice, some of you out there\nare going, no, it doesn't Mike, all right?\n\n493\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.170\nAnd here's why.\n\n494\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.350\nWhat if Alice leaves her\ncomputer unlocked and\n\n495\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.410\ngoes down to the break room to get a soda.\n\n496\n00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.642\nAnd Mr. Bad Guy is able to come in, oops.\n\n497\n00:26:04.642 --> 00:26:10.253\nLet's see if I can grab Mr. Bad Guy here.\n\n498\n00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:12.860\nI can't get bad guy out of there.\n\n499\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.340\nMy drawing is goofing up on me,\nbad guy where are you?\n\n500\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.750\nLet's just take this and that's too bad.\n\n501\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.950\nAnyway, let's ungroup this real quick,\nI apologize for my drawings.\n\n502\n00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.460\nMr. Bad Guy steps in and\n\n503\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.820\nsits down, goodness gracious,\nI just destroy her certificate as well.\n\n504\n00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.460\nLet me ungroup that also.\n\n505\n00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.400\nThere we go, Mr. Attacker steps in and\nsits down in Allice's computer, right?\n\n506\n00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.088\nAnd now he uses that application and\ndigitally signs it, right?\n\n507\n00:26:46.088 --> 00:26:48.560\nIt will still look like\nit came from Alice.\n\n508\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.060\nThe computer says it was Alice's key.\n\n509\n00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.890\nSo really what we're proving\nis not that Alice sent it, but\n\n510\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.510\nthat Alice's private key was\nused to sign the document.\n\n511\n00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.870\nSo if Alice has given other\npeople access to the private key,\n\n512\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.850\nwe lose that non-repudiation, right?\n\n513\n00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.480\nSo I just wanna make\nsure you understand that.\n\n514\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.160\nWhen I say we can verify,\nwe can prove that it was Alice,\n\n515\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.890\nthat's assuming everything\nelse has been done correctly.\n\n516\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.460\nAnd that Alice hasn't left\nher computer unlocked and\n\n517\n00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.470\na bad guy hasn't hacked into her\nmachine and is sending messages as her.\n\n518\n00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.150\nWe'll put Alice back and say,\nshe's too smart for that.\n\n519\n00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.260\nShe would never leave\nher computer unattended.\n\n520\n00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.460\nSo last thing I want to\ntalk about is hashing.\n\n521\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.550\nI mentioned that when we were\ntalking about signing the email.\n\n522\n00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.040\nI said the signature was\nactually an encrypted hash value.\n\n523\n00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.660\nWhat is a hash?\n\n524\n00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.800\nWell, a hash is the third type of\nalgorithm that I want to talk about.\n\n525\n00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.100\nWe talked about symmetric\nencryption algorithms.\n\n526\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.870\nWe talked about asymmetric\nencryption algorithm.\n\n527\n00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.660\nI also want to talk about\nhashing algorithms.\n\n528\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.980\nAnd what we need to know about a hash,\nfirst and\n\n529\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.690\nforemost, is that it's\na one way encryption.\n\n530\n00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.990\nYeah, one way encryption.\n\n531\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:06.140\nWhat that means is once I encrypt it using\na hashing algorithm, I can't get it back.\n\n532\n00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:10.970\n[LAUGH] So this is not something you\ndo to protect your corporate data.\n\n533\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.130\nThis is not something you're gonna\ndo to encrypt your documents, right?\n\n534\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.170\nBecause what were the point be?\n\n535\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.040\nI can't get them back out [LAUGH].\n\n536\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.640\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nit's like working for the CIA.\n\n537\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.886\nMy job so secret even I don't\nknow what I'm doing [LAUGH].\n\n538\n00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:24.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n539\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.870\nSo I sometimes hesitate to really lump\nit in with an encryption algorithm,\n\n540\n00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.820\nbut it is.\n\n541\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:36.080\nI mean and what it's doing is it's using\nan algorithm, you're inputting plain text.\n\n542\n00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.170\nOut the back end comes cypher tag,\nso it is encrypting it.\n\n543\n00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.630\nIt's just the fact that I\ncan't take that cypher text,\n\n544\n00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.690\nrun it backwards through the encryption\nmachine and get the plain text back out.\n\n545\n00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:46.320\nAll right?\n\n546\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.600\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n547\n00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.620\nAnd that's because the way a hash\nworks is it generates what\n\n548\n00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.490\nwe call a fixed-length string.\n\n549\n00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.030\nIn other words, it's always\ngonna put out the same number of\n\n550\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.660\nbits in this hash value no\nmatter what you put in.\n\n551\n00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.450\nIf you put in a single word, you put\nin the entire Webster's Dictionary,\n\n552\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.870\nit's always gonna generate\nthe same length hash value.\n\n553\n00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.822\nAnd the hashing algorithm are named like,\n\n554\n00:29:13.822 --> 00:29:18.771\nI don't know, like NB5, SHA128, SHA256.\n\n555\n00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:25.233\nAnd that's because the output of\nSHA256 is a 256-bit string, all right?\n\n556\n00:29:25.233 --> 00:29:26.508\nNo matter what you feed into it,\n\n557\n00:29:26.508 --> 00:29:29.310\nit's always gonna generate\nthat same length output.\n\n558\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:34.800\nSo if I can decrypt it or get it back out,\nwhat the heck would I ever use it for?\n\n559\n00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.360\nWell, for integrity, all right?\n\n560\n00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.720\nHashing is used all over the place for\ndata integrity.\n\n561\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.670\nWhen we sent TCP/IP packets that\nhave data integrity in there.\n\n562\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.930\nWhen we do digital signatures.\n\n563\n00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.130\nWhen we check our filesystems, right?\n\n564\n00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.850\nLike in an operating system\nwhen it checks its system files\n\n565\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.860\nto make sure they haven't been modified.\n\n566\n00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:01.121\nWhen you take a check sum, when you're\ndoing forensics on a hard drive.\n\n567\n00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:05.260\nI mean all this is using hashing,\nit's generating this hash value.\n\n568\n00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.580\nSo some terminology.\n\n569\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.140\nWe've got our plain text\nthat we're gonna input.\n\n570\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.240\nWe've got our hashing algorithm.\n\n571\n00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.990\nAnd then the output is known as\na hash value or simply a hash, okay.\n\n572\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:22.200\nAnd one of the cool things about these\nhashing algorithms is the fact that if I\n\n573\n00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.430\ntake the sam bit of data and\nI feed it into this hashing algorithm.\n\n574\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:32.940\nIt will always generate the exact\nsame output, I can feed that same\n\n575\n00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:38.940\ninformation into that algorithm 100 times,\nits always gonna generate the same output.\n\n576\n00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:44.440\nIf I take that input, that plain text and\nI change a single character in there.\n\n577\n00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.400\nAnd I feed it through that algorithm.\n\n578\n00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.970\nIt's gonna generate\na completely different output.\n\n579\n00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.080\nCompletely different hash value.\n\n580\n00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.010\nSingle character.\n\n581\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.770\nIt can be the entire Webster's Dictionary\nthat I'm feeding into this thing.\n\n582\n00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.050\nJust add a period anywhere\nin the thousands of pages,\n\n583\n00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.070\nit'll have a completely\ndifferent hash value.\n\n584\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.290\nSo what that's doing is it's\nallowing me to determine\n\n585\n00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.550\nif a file has been modified or not.\n\n586\n00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.380\nThis is how Windows for example,\nkeeps track of your system files.\n\n587\n00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.750\nIt has a file where it's taking all\nthose important system files and\n\n588\n00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.590\nit's run them through a hashing algorithm.\n\n589\n00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.800\nAnd it's recorded the hash values for\nevery single one of those files.\n\n590\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.790\nEvery time your system starts up, it runs\nthose files through that hashing algorithm\n\n591\n00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.860\nagain, looks at the output,\ncompares it to what it has on record.\n\n592\n00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.140\nIf those match,\n\n593\n00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:32.570\nthen that document has not changed since\nwe checked that sum or that hash value.\n\n594\n00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.290\nIf one of those has changed,\nif they don't match, something's changed.\n\n595\n00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.090\nI don't know what,\nit doesn't indicate what's changed or\n\n596\n00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.520\nhow much has changed, it just tells\nme that something has changed.\n\n597\n00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.278\nBut that's all I really need to know,\nright?\n\n598\n00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:47.559\nCuz now I can say that system file is bad,\nthrow it out,\n\n599\n00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:51.763\ngrab a new copy from my recovery partition\nor from the disk or from wherever,\n\n600\n00:31:51.763 --> 00:31:54.276\nput it back in its place and\nwe're good to go.\n\n601\n00:31:54.276 --> 00:31:59.346\nOkay, when you download an ISO for Linux,\nfor example, when you got to DistroWatch,\n\n602\n00:31:59.346 --> 00:32:04.068\none of the things you worry about is if\nthere's any malware inserted into that ISO\n\n603\n00:32:04.068 --> 00:32:07.490\nthat you're downloading from\nthis mirror site, right?\n\n604\n00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.540\nYou're not getting it from the vendor\nusually, you're going to some mirrored\n\n605\n00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:16.800\nsite and what's to stop the mirrored site\nfrom inserting some malware into that ISO.\n\n606\n00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.200\nAnd hopefully you download it, and\nyou install it on your machine, and\n\n607\n00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200\nit puts a back door, and its calling home,\nand now you're compromised.\n\n608\n00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.470\nWell, if you ever look closely\nwhen you download those ISOs,\n\n609\n00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.240\nthere's the ISO and\nthen there's usually like an MD5 value.\n\n610\n00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.660\nThat's the hash value.\n\n611\n00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.860\nSo what they want you to do\nis download the ISO, okay,\n\n612\n00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.550\nrun it through a hashing algorithm,\ngenerate your own MD5 value,\n\n613\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.090\ncompare it with the one they\nhave posted on the website.\n\n614\n00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.980\nIf the value you just generated\nmatches the one that they've\n\n615\n00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.250\nposted on the website,\n\n616\n00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:53.240\nthen you know your ISO is exactly the same\nas the one they intended for you to get.\n\n617\n00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.421\nIf those don't match,\nthat means the ISO you've downloaded does\n\n618\n00:32:57.421 --> 00:33:01.538\nnot exactly match the ISO that\nthey wanted you to get, all right.\n\n619\n00:33:01.538 --> 00:33:03.578\nSame thing with TCP packets, right,\n\n620\n00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:06.892\nwhen they go across the network\nthey get to the receiving end,\n\n621\n00:33:06.892 --> 00:33:11.000\nit's got that little CRC, that cyclical\nredundancy check, a hash value.\n\n622\n00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.462\nIf that doesn't match, then it drops\nthe package, it says resend it.\n\n623\n00:33:14.462 --> 00:33:15.370\nAll right.\n\n624\n00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.570\nWhen we do digital signatures,\nthis is what we're doing.\n\n625\n00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.120\nWe're running a hash for the email.\n\n626\n00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.280\nWe're generating a hash value, and\nthen we're encrypting the hash value\n\n627\n00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.960\nwith your private key, and\nthen you're sending it on.\n\n628\n00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.930\nAnd then other end is using your public\nkey to decrypt the hash value, right?\n\n629\n00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.990\nThe signature, which gives it\nnon-repudiation if your public key worked.\n\n630\n00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.860\nThen it can take that hash value,\nset it aside, generate its own hash value.\n\n631\n00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.860\nCompare those, and we can see if\nthe email was modified in transit,\n\n632\n00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.630\neither accidentally or maliciously.\n\n633\n00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.240\nSo now,\nnot only did I get non-repudiation, but\n\n634\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.510\nI get data integrity by\napplying a digital signature.\n\n635\n00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.920\nLet me give you an example,\nI've got an oldie but a goodie here.\n\n636\n00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.410\nPart of Karen's power tools,\nthis is PTHasher, and it allows me to,\n\n637\n00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.620\nit's a really good one to demo and\nplay around with hash values.\n\n638\n00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:09.008\nFor example, I could type in here,\nHello world.\n\n639\n00:34:09.008 --> 00:34:13.451\nAnd then I could compute any\none of these hash values,\n\n640\n00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:17.321\nMD5, SHA-1, 224, 256, 512.\n\n641\n00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:20.411\nLet's just do MD5, I'll click compute.\n\n642\n00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:23.131\nAnd so there is the MD5.\n\n643\n00:34:23.131 --> 00:34:25.206\nNow that's hex, okay.\n\n644\n00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:26.340\nThose aren't actual bits.\n\n645\n00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.860\nThat's hexadecimal, so each one of those\ncharacters is actually four bits, right?\n\n646\n00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.720\nWe learned that in a previous episode.\n\n647\n00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.870\nIf I change over to 256 and\nI calculate it, you'll see it's a much\n\n648\n00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.627\nlonger stream cuz this is\na 256 bit output, where gosh,\n\n649\n00:34:40.627 --> 00:34:45.430\nWes, MD5 I want to say is 128,\nbut I'd have to go look that up.\n\n650\n00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:48.688\nI can do SHA512, all right.\n\n651\n00:34:48.688 --> 00:34:53.170\nAnd so the same input generating\na longer output, right.\n\n652\n00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.370\nWhat if I do this?\n\n653\n00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.080\nLet's go back to MD5 cuz that was a pretty\nshort one, and I'll calculate it out.\n\n654\n00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.515\nAnd let's do this, let's take that value\nand we're gonna put it in Notepad.\n\n655\n00:35:09.906 --> 00:35:11.932\nIf Windows will play along with me.\n\n656\n00:35:11.932 --> 00:35:14.407\nAnd I'm gonna paste that in there, okay?\n\n657\n00:35:14.407 --> 00:35:17.010\nSo there's the value that I just pasted.\n\n658\n00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:21.376\nNow I'm gonna run this again,\nand I'm gonna grab it,\n\n659\n00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:26.760\ncopy it, paste it, and\nyou'll see exactly the same.\n\n660\n00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.870\nAnd I could do it over and\nover and over again.\n\n661\n00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.296\nNow I'm gonna come up here, I'm just gonna\nput a little exclamation point there.\n\n662\n00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:36.827\nI'm gonna calculate it one more time,\nand we're gonna grab that value,\n\n663\n00:35:36.827 --> 00:35:38.519\nand we're gonna paste it.\n\n664\n00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.270\nAnd notice it's obviously different,\nright,\n\n665\n00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.270\njust by changing a single character.\n\n666\n00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.940\nAgain, same thing,\nif I took an entire file.\n\n667\n00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.130\nLet's see if I have anything\nI can actually modify.\n\n668\n00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:55.769\nHere's a dictionary, a little Excel\ndocument, so I'm gonna try to drag.\n\n669\n00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:58.640\nI should be able to drag and drop.\n\n670\n00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.780\nIt's not liking that.\n\n671\n00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.810\nWe'll say add files.\n\n672\n00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.470\nAnd I go over to my desktop,\nand I'll grab that spreadsheet,\n\n673\n00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.770\nand I will compute the MD5 value.\n\n674\n00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.164\nAll right, and there you can see\nthat MD5 value, right there.\n\n675\n00:36:18.164 --> 00:36:21.745\nAnd let's just pay attention, A33,\nI don't know if it'll let me copy it,\n\n676\n00:36:21.745 --> 00:36:22.789\nlet's try to copy it.\n\n677\n00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:28.340\nNope, that's the last thing I copied.\n\n678\n00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.200\nLet's see, copy results to clip board,\nlet's see if it'll let me do that.\n\n679\n00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.559\nWe'll start over with our document.\n\n680\n00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.585\nAll right, so with a little editing,\nwe'll be able to see this,\n\n681\n00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:44.510\ndown at the bottom there, so there is\nthe actual hash value that it generated.\n\n682\n00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.513\nNow, I'm going to modify this document,\nI'm gonna open it up.\n\n683\n00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:54.750\nAnd I'm just gonna put\nthe letter A right there, and\n\n684\n00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.226\nI'm going to save it, and\nI'm going to close it.\n\n685\n00:36:58.226 --> 00:37:03.822\nAnd now I'm going to remove this file,\nand I'm going to add that file again.\n\n686\n00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:11.927\nAnd I'll compute that MD5 one more time,\ncopy it to the clipboard,\n\n687\n00:37:11.927 --> 00:37:16.780\nwe'll paste this in here and\nlook at the two values, right?\n\n688\n00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.475\nCompletely different,\nso obviously changed.\n\n689\n00:37:21.475 --> 00:37:24.170\nAnd that's what hash is all about.\n\n690\n00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.290\nIt's not a way to protect my data, because\nI can't get the original data back out.\n\n691\n00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.310\nSo it doesn't do me any good\nto go around hash all my.\n\n692\n00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.740\nIn fact, the original document,\nnotice the spreadsheet is not encrypted.\n\n693\n00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.760\nThe original document\nis still in plain text.\n\n694\n00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.370\nSo what comes out of the hashing\nalgorithm is not really ciphertext as\n\n695\n00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.170\nmuch as two things come out the backside\nwhen you use the hashing algorithm.\n\n696\n00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:51.768\nThe original document still in\nits original plain text form.\n\n697\n00:37:51.768 --> 00:37:56.496\nAnd a hash value, which you could really\nsay is an encrypted representation of\n\n698\n00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:59.940\nthe document, but\nit's not the actual document.\n\n699\n00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.230\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n700\n00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.850\nAnd this is why I tell you I hate it\nwhen I read books and websites or\n\n701\n00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:09.690\nwhatever, that say, you know that\nhashing is an encryption algorithm.\n\n702\n00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.600\nIt's really not, because your\ndocument does not get encrypted,\n\n703\n00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.380\nit is still plain text.\n\n704\n00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:21.982\nIt's a way to generate an encrypted\nrepresentation of your document,\n\n705\n00:38:21.982 --> 00:38:23.150\nall right.\n\n706\n00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.970\nAnd it's completely irreversible, I can't,\n\n707\n00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.870\nbecause it always put out the same length,\nthere's no way that I can take that.\n\n708\n00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.750\nI have no idea, let's say I just had this,\nor let's do this.\n\n709\n00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.330\nLet's say I just had this, all right?.\n\n710\n00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.810\nSo I got the hash value for\none of your documents.\n\n711\n00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.550\nI have no idea even how\nlong your document was.\n\n712\n00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.820\nIt could have been one word,\nit could have been 10,000 words.\n\n713\n00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.970\nBecause every time you run it through\nthere it always generates the same output.\n\n714\n00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.120\nSo this gives me no indication of\nhow many characters there are,\n\n715\n00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.400\nthere's no way I can\nstart detecting patterns.\n\n716\n00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.110\nThat's why I say it's not reversible,\nbut that's not what we're using it for.\n\n717\n00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.630\nWe're not using for confidentiality, and\nthat's the one I want you to remember.\n\n718\n00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.580\nHashing is not confidentiality,\nit's data integrity, all right?\n\n719\n00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.350\n&gt;&gt; And giving an example,\nyou had just said, Hello world, and\n\n720\n00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.040\nthen what did you do?\n\n721\n00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.580\nYou added an exclamation point, and\nthe values were the same size, but\n\n722\n00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.544\ngiven by comparison an entire Excel\nSpreadsheet, the values didn't change.\n\n723\n00:39:17.544 --> 00:39:18.155\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n724\n00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Even though there were two letters\nversus a whole of bunch of letters.\n\n725\n00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.766\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now that's a lot of good information,\n\n726\n00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:25.910\nMike, when it comes to giving us\nthe basics of cryptology here.\n\n727\n00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.498\nAnd guys,\nwe're just scratching the surface.\n\n728\n00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:30.260\nWe've got a lot more to go but\nI have to say, Mike,\n\n729\n00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.560\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n730\n00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.634\nSo do you have additional things\nyou'd like to put in this one, or\n\n731\n00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:35.776\nare we gonna go ahead and wrap it up?\n\n732\n00:39:35.776 --> 00:39:37.440\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's good for now.\n\n733\n00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.060\nYou know, like I said, the main thing\nI'd want you to get out these last two\n\n734\n00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.170\nepisodes is understand the difference\nbetween symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n735\n00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:48.490\nKnow what hashing is all about,\nknow why we do cryptography, and\n\n736\n00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.110\nknow the difference between a stream and\n\n737\n00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.770\na block cypher, and\nthat should get you pretty far.\n\n738\n00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's a great place to wrap this up.\n\n739\n00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.550\nAs always, Mike,\nwe appreciate having you here.\n\n740\n00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.830\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer watching,\nhopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n741\n00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.720\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n742\n00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n743\n00:40:04.610 -->

00:00:08.273\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:11.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our GIAC\n\n7\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.770\nsecurity essentials, or\nGSEC essentials for short.\n\n8\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.370\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.810\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.810\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes, glad to be back and\nexcited to continue on with our GSEC.\n\n12\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.775\nIn this one we're gonna be looking\nat public key infrastructure,\n\n13\n00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:42.255\nor PKI, as well as taking a look\nat something called steganography\n\n14\n00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.465\nwhich is nothing to do with dinosaurs.\n\n15\n00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.815\nAnd we also need to go back,\nwrap around, and\n\n16\n00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:49.375\ntalk a little bit about crypto attacks.\n\n17\n00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.920\nAnd we talked a lot about cryptology,\nencryption in previous episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.040\nAnd I wanna talk about some of\nthe attacks that we might face.\n\n19\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.780\nAnd really,\nmore familiarizing ourselves with some\n\n20\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.210\nterminology that we need to be able to\ndiscuss when we discuss that cryptography.\n\n21\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.370\nWhew, tongue-tied today.\n\n22\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.190\nAll right, so, let's start off with PKI,\nor public key infrastructure and\n\n23\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.790\nin the previous episode, we had talked\nabout different encryption methods.\n\n24\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.700\nWe talked about symmetric\nversus asymmetric algorithms,\n\n25\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.200\nand where secret key or\nshared key for the symmetric.\n\n26\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.310\nAnd then with asymmetric,\nwe also called it public key cryptography,\n\n27\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.060\nasymmetric encryption or\n\n28\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.330\nasymmetric algorithms where we have two\ndifferent keys that work as a key pair.\n\n29\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.900\nAnd one of them you do the encryption and\n\n30\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.520\nthen the other one would\nbe used to decrypt it.\n\n31\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.670\nAnd I mentioned in that episode\nthat normally that key pair,\n\n32\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.940\nthat gets assigned to you or\ngets generated for\n\n33\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.840\nyou, the public key is part of\nyour certificate, all right.\n\n34\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140\nAnd then the private key gets\nstored in a secure location and\n\n35\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.850\nyou can distribute your certificate which\nincludes your public key to whomever.\n\n36\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.410\nIf you make it available on the web, store\nin Active Directory, whatever you're doing\n\n37\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.330\nin your environment, email it to\nsomebody if they need it, right.\n\n38\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.870\nSo what we wanna do now is talk\nabout now is how we got that.\n\n39\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.080\nWe need to talk about the infrastructure\nthat we would use to support that.\n\n40\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.950\nWhat if I wanna use certificates,\nI decide that hey certificates make sense,\n\n41\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.730\nI want people to have certificates so\nthey can log in.\n\n42\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.750\nMaybe we store them on a smart card,\nright.\n\n43\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.340\nWe've talked about that in our\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n44\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520\nMaybe that's what we're gonna\nswitch to in our organization.\n\n45\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.070\nMaybe just for doorway entry, or\nfor logging onto the systems.\n\n46\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.650\nOr maybe I wanna issue certificates to my\nmachines so that they can create IP set\n\n47\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.860\nconversations between those file servers\nthat contain sensitive information.\n\n48\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.780\nSo we can secure that, right,\nall that's done with certificates.\n\n49\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.960\nThat VPN that your\nmobile users create when\n\n50\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.080\nthey connect back to the workplace, right.\n\n51\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.830\nGood chance that you wanna use\ncertificates as one of the authentication\n\n52\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.030\nmethods in that or direct access or\nwhatever else it is.\n\n53\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.900\nOr you need to set up\nan SSL on your website for\n\n54\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.120\nyour customers to come and\nbuy products from you.\n\n55\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.730\nThey're not gonna put that credit number\nin there if you don't have a secure,\n\n56\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.620\nconnection, right.\n\n57\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.550\nThey wanna see that S,\nat the end of that HTTP.\n\n58\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.710\nWhether that is SSL, or TLS, they wanna\nmake sure the connection is secure,\n\n59\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.000\nwhich means we need certificates.\n\n60\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.797\nSo certificates play a big part\nin security in the enterprise and\n\n61\n00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:24.610\nit's important we understand how\nwe go about supporting that.\n\n62\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.000\nIf we're gonna generate our own, or\nwe can go out and purchase these,\n\n63\n00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.090\nactually, as well.\n\n64\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.780\nSo let's start with just the basics.\n\n65\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.460\nRemember, a certificate\nis not a piece of paper.\n\n66\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.570\nYou're not gonna get\nanything handed to you.\n\n67\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.180\nIt is an electronic document\nthat really does one big thing,\n\n68\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.710\nand that is tie an identity to a key pair,\nright.\n\n69\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.660\nWe're gonna generate a key pair,\nthose mathematically related keys, and\n\n70\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.630\nthen we're gonna take that public key and\nwe're gonna put it in that certificate,\n\n71\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.820\nand then we're gonna\nbind that to an identity.\n\n72\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.800\nWhether that's Wes, cuz he is an employee,\nor whether that's the laptop, because we\n\n73\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.390\nwanna issue them to the laptops, or\nwe're binding it to our website,\n\n74\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.630\nthe web server's identity svr01\ndot lab dot itpro dot tv.\n\n75\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.740\nWe can use wildcards in there\nwhen it comes to some of that.\n\n76\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.200\nBut basically, I want you to understand\nthat we're taking where a certificate\n\n77\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.735\nis tying in a key pair to an identity.\n\n78\n00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:20.765\nBecause once Wes gets\nissued that certificate,\n\n79\n00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:24.125\nright, that has his information\nin the certificate, his name.\n\n80\n00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.805\nIf it's in Active Directory it might\ninclude other information about his\n\n81\n00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:30.535\naccount, and then that public key and\nthen he has the private key.\n\n82\n00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:34.465\nSo that key pair is now tied to Wes,\nright, or\n\n83\n00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:36.439\nif I issue to a machine or what have you.\n\n84\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.110\nSo we got that down pat, I think,\n\n85\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.540\ncertificates really tie\nan identity to a key pair.\n\n86\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.390\nNow some other terms we\nneed to be familiar with,\n\n87\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.480\nwe need to understand what PKI is,\nor public key infrastructure.\n\n88\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.000\nAnd PKI is all the pieces parts\n\n89\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.230\nthat we use to manage certificates and\nit's throughout their entire lifetime.\n\n90\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.510\nThat is the issuing, the creation,\nand the issuing of those certificates,\n\n91\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.780\nto the managing of those certificates,\nduring their lifetime.\n\n92\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.960\nAnd then eventually the removal or\n\n93\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.000\nrevocation of those certificates as well,\nso that entire process.\n\n94\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.243\nAnd there's a few different pieces,\nthat names or\n\n95\n00:05:17.243 --> 00:05:18.765\nterms we need to be familiar with.\n\n96\n00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:21.359\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand\n\n97\n00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:26.056\nthis is a platform-independent view of\na PKI or public key infrastructure.\n\n98\n00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:29.787\nI've got Alice down here, and\nshe wants to request a certificate so\n\n99\n00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:32.696\nthat she can digitally sign her emails,\nall right.\n\n100\n00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:36.380\nSo what' she's gonna do is she's\ngonna step number one here,\n\n101\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.300\nshe's gonna talk to\na registration authority.\n\n102\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.140\nNow the registration authority\nis the part of the PKI that\n\n103\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.300\nvalidates the identity, right.\n\n104\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.880\nI shouldn't be able to talk to that\nregistration authority and say,\n\n105\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.580\nhey, I'm Wes.\n\n106\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.140\nCan I get a certificate, right?\n\n107\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.550\nWe've gotta make sure that we are issuing\nthe certificates in the proper name.\n\n108\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.580\nWhat if I went in and said, hey,\n\n109\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.030\nI want to get a certificate in\nthe name of Bank of America, right.\n\n110\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.580\nAnd I set up a website that\nlooks just like Bank of America.\n\n111\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.320\nI've got a certificate that\nsays I'm Bank of America.\n\n112\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.190\nThat would not be a good thing, right?\n\n113\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.340\nSo a very important part of\nissuing certificates, and\n\n114\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.550\nof our public key infrastructure,\nis that registration authority,\n\n115\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.805\nthe part where we validate the identity.\n\n116\n00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:17.770\nBecause we're tying a key\npair to an identity,\n\n117\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.170\nI better make sure I know that identity.\n\n118\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.130\nYou know this isn't exactly the same but\nby analogy here Mike,\n\n119\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.410\nrecently I had to travel overseas and\nI needed a passport really quick.\n\n120\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.970\nBut I couldn't actually apply for\none and get it back in time,\n\n121\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.160\nso they had somebody that I could take\nall of my identifying information.\n\n122\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.770\nAnd I could hand it over to them, and\n\n123\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.150\nthen they could request\nthe passport on my behalf.\n\n124\n00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.770\nSo your registration authority is kinda\nlike a proxy between you getting that\n\n125\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.490\ncertificate and\nrequesting that certificate.\n\n126\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.230\nAre we pretty close here?\n\n127\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.440\n&gt;&gt; That's a great analogy,\nbecause whoever's doing the issuing of\n\n128\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.230\nthe passport trusts this person or this\nentity that you took your information to.\n\n129\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.460\nAnd they're saying, okay we're gonna\ntrust the fact that this third party\n\n130\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.390\nis validating all that information.\n\n131\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.014\nAnd that's exactly what\nthe registration authority is doing,\n\n132\n00:07:05.014 --> 00:07:06.910\ncuz it's not issuing the certificate.\n\n133\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.040\nThe registration authority is\nonly validating the identity.\n\n134\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.850\nAnd then it's gonna forward in step two,\nis when it forwards that over and\n\n135\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.715\nsays all right.\n\n136\n00:07:15.715 --> 00:07:18.524\nI have validated all this information,\nhere is the request,\n\n137\n00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:20.584\nhere is the information\nabout the identity.\n\n138\n00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:25.121\nNow the certificate authority, this part\nup here, this is the one that actually\n\n139\n00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:29.320\ndoes the issuing the generation and\nthe issuing of the certificate.\n\n140\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.610\nSo, in Wes's is analogy that would be\nwhoever is actually issuing the passport.\n\n141\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.260\nIt would be the US government that\nwould be issuing the passport.\n\n142\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.120\nBut they had somebody else acting as\n\n143\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.820\nthe registration authority\non behalf of them, right.\n\n144\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.422\nSo that's a great analogy,\nI really like that.\n\n145\n00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:50.368\nAll right, now the certificate authority\nthen based on that information\n\n146\n00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:53.243\nit receives and\npolicies that it might have in place.\n\n147\n00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:56.809\nLike who's allowed or not allowed to\nrequest, what information has to be\n\n148\n00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.915\npresented, like What if I went\nto the registration authority,\n\n149\n00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:03.720\nand I gave him my name, and my last name,\nand my address and yadda yadda.\n\n150\n00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.090\nTries to present that,\nmaybe that doesn't comply with the policy.\n\n151\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.980\nWes, you probably had to provide certain\n\n152\n00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.131\ndocuments-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n153\n00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n154\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.400\nThey wanted everything.\n\n155\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.190\nAbout the only thing I think that\nthey didn't want was my blood type.\n\n156\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you had left\none of those documents out?\n\n157\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the registration authority,\nif you will, in this case,\n\n158\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.930\nwas gonna take that document.\n\n159\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.230\nAnd they were gonna send it back to me,\nand they wouldn't even have bothered.\n\n160\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so, we have policies\nthat'll define what information is\n\n161\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.100\nnecessary to request a certificate.\n\n162\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.200\nWho can receive a certificate?\n\n163\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.890\nWhat the certificate can be used for,\nbecause we haven't talked about that.\n\n164\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.260\nCertificates have purpose as well.\n\n165\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.600\nSo, we'll continue on here.\n\n166\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.270\nSo, the certificate authority gets\nthe information from the registration\n\n167\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.120\nauthority.\n\n168\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.980\nThe certificate authority makes a\ndecision, says, okay, based on policy and\n\n169\n00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.120\nthe information given, we'll go ahead and\nissue the certificate.\n\n170\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.430\nThe certificate then gets issued to Alice,\n\n171\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.270\nthat means she now has a digital\ncertificate with a public key inside it.\n\n172\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.780\nAnd a private key that gets stored in\na secure location on her local hard drive.\n\n173\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.549\nNow, she can take that certificate and\nsay present it to a secure mail server.\n\n174\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.950\nAll right, so maybe she's setting up\nHTTPS to connect to that mail server,\n\n175\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.300\nlike in OWA, or something like that.\n\n176\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.390\nBut when she presents that certificate,\nit doesn't automatically say, great,\n\n177\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.850\nhey Alice, thanks for coming back.\n\n178\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.194\nHere's your mail, right?\n\n179\n00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:26.621\nIt's gotta verify that certificate,\n\n180\n00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:31.189\ncuz what if I made up a certificate\nthat looks a lot like Alice's, right?\n\n181\n00:09:31.189 --> 00:09:35.360\nOr try to, we'll talk about how\neasy that is here just second.\n\n182\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.536\nWhat if, what if it's not Alice's\ncertificate, in other words?\n\n183\n00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:43.402\nSo, the mail server is not just gonna\nblindly accept the certificate that Alice\n\n184\n00:09:43.402 --> 00:09:48.052\nis presenting, it says okay,\nthis certificate says you're Alice.\n\n185\n00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:52.660\nRight, and now I'm gonna talk to\nwhat's called a validation authority.\n\n186\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.010\nI'm gonna ask that validation authority,\nhey, is this certificate okay?\n\n187\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.950\nThings that it's checking\nare primarily the expiration date,\n\n188\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.170\nand its usage,\nwhat the certificate could be used for.\n\n189\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.890\nMaking sure that,\nif it's a certificate for EFS,\n\n190\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.660\nEncrypting File System,\nthen it might not be valid for.\n\n191\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.500\nA client identification, right?\n\n192\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.420\nCertificates have\npurposes built into them.\n\n193\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.530\nAnd a certificate can be a single purpose,\nor a multi-purpose certificate.\n\n194\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.640\nIt could be that you issue users one\ncertificate for encrypting file systems,\n\n195\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.560\nbut a different certificate for\ndoing digital signatures on emails, right?\n\n196\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.080\nOr you could issue them a multi-purpose\ncertificate that covers all of those.\n\n197\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.040\nBut it's checking the purpose, and\nthe validity period on that certificate.\n\n198\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.850\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of law enforcement here.\n\n199\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.414\nIf I have to present my driver's license,\nthey can see the driver's license.\n\n200\n00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:46.740\nNow, technically, they can see\nthe expiration date on it, but\n\n201\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.248\nwhat they don't know, just by\nlooking at it is whether my license,\n\n202\n00:10:50.248 --> 00:10:52.849\ndo I even have the right to\nbe on the road with this?\n\n203\n00:10:52.849 --> 00:10:54.790\nSo, they check,\nkind a like their own database.\n\n204\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.480\nWould that be close to\nthe validation authority,\n\n205\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.280\nmaking sure that it hasn't been suspended?\n\n206\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.380\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n207\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.330\nWhen we talk about,\nit's another great analogy,\n\n208\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.160\nis using that drivers license,\nbecause it really fits this whole process.\n\n209\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.620\nHere in the states, we have the Department\nof Motor Vehicles, and they issue these\n\n210\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.382\ndrivers license, and before you can get a\nlicense, you have to prove your identity.\n\n211\n00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:17.685\nSo, they're the registration authority\nslash certificate authority,\n\n212\n00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:19.790\nwhere they would validate\nall my information,\n\n213\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.040\nissue me a certificate, a driver's\nlicense in this case, and hand it to me.\n\n214\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.890\nThey put a state of Florida seal,\nin my case, here in Florida, and\n\n215\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.530\nthen they laminate it,\nthey handed it back to me.\n\n216\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:33.670\nAnd when I give it to the police officer,\ngosh forbid I get pulled over, he trusted\n\n217\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:39.450\nall the information on that driver's\nlicense is valid and accurate, why?\n\n218\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.466\nHe doesn't have to go verifying\nmy address and height, my weight.\n\n219\n00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:46.142\nHe trusted because he\ntrust the issuing poly.\n\n220\n00:11:46.142 --> 00:11:48.053\nAnd we'll come back to\nthat concept of trust,\n\n221\n00:11:48.053 --> 00:11:50.510\nbecause that's a very important part,\nbut there is seal.\n\n222\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.540\nHe knows the state of Florida, before\nthey issued me that drivers license,\n\n223\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.010\nverified all the information.\n\n224\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.150\nSo, as long as the officer\ntrusts the state of Florida,\n\n225\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.540\nand he can trust the information\nthat's being presented in that ID.\n\n226\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.990\nAnd like you were saying, the thing is,\na certificate has a validity period.\n\n227\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.140\nIt has a lifetime to it.\n\n228\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.280\nWhen I issue a certificate to a user,\nit might be good for one year.\n\n229\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.950\nIt might be good for two years,\nit could be good for 20 years, but\n\n230\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.910\nwe typically keep them short,\nbecause things change.\n\n231\n00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.820\nAnd I wanna update that certificate\ninformation when it does.\n\n232\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.690\nSo, they might have a period of one or\ntwo or five years for being valid.\n\n233\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.970\nBut just like a driver's\nlicense here in the US,\n\n234\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.630\nan expired driver's license is no good.\n\n235\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.280\nIf you hand an, you can't even go buy\nadult beverages with an expired license,\n\n236\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.910\neven though your birthday hasn't changed,\nright?\n\n237\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.015\nYour birthday is still your birthday,\nthe license has expired, but\n\n238\n00:12:40.015 --> 00:12:41.440\nthey won't accept it.\n\n239\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.380\nBecause now we don't trust it anymore,\nwe don't trust that document.\n\n240\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.476\nIt's the same thing with certificates,\nthey have a validity period, and if you go\n\n241\n00:12:49.476 --> 00:12:53.102\nto present a certificate to a server,\nor if you go to a secure website, and\n\n242\n00:12:53.102 --> 00:12:57.315\nthat server presents a certificate, and\nit's expired, your system will tell you,\n\n243\n00:12:57.315 --> 00:13:01.790\nhey, look, are you sure you want to trust\nthis certificate, because it's expired?\n\n244\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.300\nAnd you really shouldn't, right?\n\n245\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.075\nBut that's what the validation\nauthority is doing.\n\n246\n00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:09.817\nHe's checking the validity period on that\ncertificate, he's also checking with\n\n247\n00:13:09.817 --> 00:13:13.881\nthe certificate authority to see if\nthe certificate has been revoked,\n\n248\n00:13:13.881 --> 00:13:16.945\nbecause certificates are valid for\na period of time.\n\n249\n00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:20.039\nAnd once that certificate gets issued,\nit's very difficult,\n\n250\n00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.596\nI can't just say you know what?\n\n251\n00:13:21.596 --> 00:13:26.490\nWes left the company, now I need to go\nget that certificate back from him.\n\n252\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.520\nIt's an electronic document.\n\n253\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.560\nI can't ask for him to turn it in\non his way out the door, right?\n\n254\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.580\nHe might have multiple copies\nof this who knows where.\n\n255\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.050\nSo, I can't just take that one that's\non his computer and say, okay,\n\n256\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.900\nI've got it, so we have a system in\nplace where we've revoked certificates.\n\n257\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.570\nJust like with our drivers license here\nin the states, you can get your license\n\n258\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.450\nsuspended if you don't pay your tickets\nin time, or whatever the case may be.\n\n259\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.870\nAnd so that police officer pulls you over,\nthe reason he's running your license\n\n260\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.920\nthrough the computer is not to\nverify the information on there.\n\n261\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.650\nHe knows that the state of Florida\nverified that information.\n\n262\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.990\nAnd that stuff is correct,\n\n263\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.480\nwhat he doesn't know is if that\ndriver's license is suspended.\n\n264\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.630\nBecause if you didn't pay your tickets,\nFlorida suspends your license, but\n\n265\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.320\nthey didn't come to your house, knock\non your door and take the license back.\n\n266\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.876\nThey don't have anyway to reach out and\nmark your license with a big S for\n\n267\n00:14:11.876 --> 00:14:12.536\nsuspended.\n\n268\n00:14:12.536 --> 00:14:15.089\nSo, they make a record\nof it in a database, and\n\n269\n00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:18.693\nthe police officer then runs your\nnumber and can look it up to see.\n\n270\n00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:20.740\nAnd that's the same thing\nthat is happening here.\n\n271\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.800\nThe validation authority or certificate\nauthority can revoke a certificate.\n\n272\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.410\nIf they suspect that\nthere's been some foul play\n\n273\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.280\nin issuing the certificate\nin the first place, or\n\n274\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.650\nwhatever the case may be,\nthey can choose to revoke a certificate.\n\n275\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.980\nBut it gets flagged in\na database as being revoked.\n\n276\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.400\nSo, what the validation\nauthority is doing is checking.\n\n277\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.190\nThe secure email server is saying, hey,\nAlice has presented me the certificate,\n\n278\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.310\nshe wants to check her mail, is this okay?\n\n279\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.530\nThe validity servers says, it looks good,\nall the information is correct,\n\n280\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.110\nlet me check with the CA.\n\n281\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.700\nThe CA says, yep, I have not revoked\nthat certificate, it is still valid.\n\n282\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.370\nAnd then it tells the secure mail server,\nand then Alice can check her mail.\n\n283\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.550\nOr it could have been\nthe certificate authority says, no,\n\n284\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.190\nthat certificate was revoked.\n\n285\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.390\nDo not accept it.\n\n286\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.110\nThe validation authority would say okay,\ntell the secure mail server,\n\n287\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.240\nand it would deny your connection,\nbecause the certificate was revoked.\n\n288\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.190\nSo, a lot of pieces, parts that make\nup our public key infrastructure.,\n\n289\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Mike, the way you've got your diagram\n\n290\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.480\npresented, would it be safe to say\nthat this is a form of authentication?\n\n291\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n292\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.300\nAnd it's a much more secure\nform of authentication.\n\n293\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.240\nThis is why organizations\nare moving to smart cards,\n\n294\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.620\nbecause we can store certificates on them.\n\n295\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.560\nNow that the price, when smart cards\nwere brand new, the technology was new,\n\n296\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.520\nthe readers, everything you needed to\nsupport smart cards was very expensive.\n\n297\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.850\nIt's come way down in price, and it's in\nthe reach of more and more businesses.\n\n298\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.778\nAnd you're seeing it used more and\nmore often.\n\n299\n00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:49.650\nBecause of the fact that it's more\nsecure than a username and a password,\n\n300\n00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.219\nI can guess Wes' password, given the right\ntools and time, I can crack his password.\n\n301\n00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:58.397\nI'm gonna have a very difficult time\ntrying to fake a certificate for Wes,\n\n302\n00:15:58.397 --> 00:16:01.410\na very, very,\nvery difficult time, all right?\n\n303\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.970\nSo, it's a much, much more secure\nmeans of authentication, so\n\n304\n00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.950\nyou're seeing it being\nused all over the place.\n\n305\n00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.020\nThe other thing I'll say about this\nis when I look at this drawing,\n\n306\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.450\nit looks like there's several pieces here.\n\n307\n00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.170\nBut in reality, a lot of these\nroles can be rolled up to one,\n\n308\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.400\ndepending on the platform you're using.\n\n309\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.430\nIn a Windows operating system,\nthe registration and\n\n310\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.130\nthe certificate authority are basically\nthe same thing, or they can be.\n\n311\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.980\nWe can split those rolls up in a tiered\nhierarchy, but a lot of times,\n\n312\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.470\nthere's a single entity.\n\n313\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.740\nThe validation authority is typically not\npart of our infrastructure, actually.\n\n314\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.280\nThe validation authority might be,\nwell, it depends, I guess,\n\n315\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.760\non how it's being set up,\nso let me rephrase that.\n\n316\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.610\nThe validation authority is also probably\npart of the certificate authority.\n\n317\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.898\nSo let me back up,\nit is part of our infrastructure.\n\n318\n00:16:47.898 --> 00:16:51.430\nI was thinking about the web server, but\nthat would actually be this guy here.\n\n319\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.530\nThis guy might or\nmight not be part of our infrastructure.\n\n320\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.613\nThis might be a public web server,\nlike Bank of America,\n\n321\n00:16:56.613 --> 00:16:59.708\nthat I'm trying to access and\npresent a certificate to.\n\n322\n00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:04.515\nSo, it is most likely, or it could,\nor could not be, either way.\n\n323\n00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:07.349\nBut the rest of this is part of\nour infrastructure, and again,\n\n324\n00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.124\nit can all be rolled up into one, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:12.848\nAll right, next thing I want to\ntalk about is the hierarchy,\n\n326\n00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:17.885\nwhen we talk about PKI, and again, we're\nnot here to learn how to set this up, and\n\n327\n00:17:17.885 --> 00:17:23.530\nhow to configure it properly, it's really\nmore about understanding the big pieces.\n\n328\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.631\nAnd when we look at a Certificate Services\nHierarchy, or CA hierarchy within\n\n329\n00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:30.659\nour public infrastructure,\nit can be a very simple one,\n\n330\n00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:35.100\nwhat I've got on my screen here,\nwhich is basically just a single server.\n\n331\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.260\nAnd that single server does everything,\n\n332\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.440\nall the components\nare on that one machine.\n\n333\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.440\nThere is a downside to doing\nsomething like this, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.488\nCertificates are based on\nwhat's called a Web of Trust.\n\n335\n00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:54.500\nIf there's no trust, these certificates\nreally don't do any good, because what's\n\n336\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.610\nto stop me from just issuing all kinds, I\ncan install certificate services, on say,\n\n337\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.580\n2016 Server Box, and I could issue\nmyself certificates for Microsoft,\n\n338\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.630\nBill Gates, Wes Bryan,\nwhatever the heck I wanted, all right?\n\n339\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.180\nSo, if there was no form of\ntrust involved in verification,\n\n340\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.100\nthis wouldn't do us any good.\n\n341\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.650\nBut there is, there's a,\nwhat they call, a web of trust.\n\n342\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.930\nAnd in a public infrastructure,\nit's a hierarchy.\n\n343\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.910\nAnd at the very top of a hierarchy,\n\n344\n00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.810\nthere's a root certificate authority,\nall right?\n\n345\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.820\nThat represents the very\ntop of a hierarchy.\n\n346\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.690\nAnd not too obvious in here, but,\nif I move to a three tier hierarchy,\n\n347\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.490\nnow you can really see, okay,\nthat root sits up at the top.\n\n348\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.844\nAnd when that very first server\nthat you set up in your PKI,\n\n349\n00:18:42.844 --> 00:18:46.536\nyour public key infrastructure,\nit needs a certificate, but\n\n350\n00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:51.082\nthere's nobody above it, there's nobody\nto issue this one a certificate.\n\n351\n00:18:51.082 --> 00:18:56.410\nSo, he creates what's called\na self-signed certificate,\n\n352\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:03.282\nthe root ca issues itself a certificate,\nissued to root ca, issued by root ca.\n\n353\n00:19:03.282 --> 00:19:08.100\nAnd that starts our public infrastructure,\nand then everything underneath that.\n\n354\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.560\nIt's issued a certificate from the root,\nor one of these, what we call,\n\n355\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.280\nsubordinate CA's, or the next few\nlevels of this hierarchy, all right?\n\n356\n00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.830\nWell, let's go back to the one tier.\n\n357\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.430\nIf this was all I had, all right?\n\n358\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.530\nSo, this guy created his own certificate,\nissued to root, issued by root, and\n\n359\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.110\nhe's gonna remain online, and\nusers and computers and whomever,\n\n360\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.740\nservices can request certificates, and\nit can issue certificates to those.\n\n361\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.090\nIf this machine ever gets compromised,\n\n362\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.450\nthat means every certificate that it's\nissued is now considered compromised,\n\n363\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.590\nbecause I don't know what I can trust and\nnot trust anymore, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.060\nThis is why we don't wanna\ndo a single tier hierarchy\n\n365\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.900\nwith PKI in most Enterprise environments.\n\n366\n00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.200\nFlower shops, possibly, but as we grow,\nwe want to move away from that.\n\n367\n00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.750\nIf we go into a two-tier hierarchy, or\nI've got a route CA, who's issued himself\n\n368\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:08.070\na certificate, and then I set up two\nmore CAs known as subordinate CAs,\n\n369\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.870\nand they request a certificate from\nthe root, and the root says, okay.\n\n370\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:18.870\nIssuing one, here's your certificate,\nsigned by root, or issues to issuing ca1.\n\n371\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:24.300\nAnd then the ca2, or issuing ca2,\nalso gets a certificate from the root.\n\n372\n00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.280\nAnd then they will issue certificates\nto the users or computers or services,\n\n373\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.960\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n374\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.840\nAnd now, and this guy,\nI'm sorry, let me go back.\n\n375\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.190\nThe root is typically taken offline,\njust not even connected to the network.\n\n376\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.020\nOnce we get him setup, and\nhe issues certificate to these two CAs,\n\n377\n00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.340\nthe subordinate CAs,\nthis guy is disconnected from the network.\n\n378\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.560\nHe is not brought back online.\n\n379\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.160\nBecause of the fact that\nif it's compromised,\n\n380\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.150\neverything else is now compromised.\n\n381\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.620\nSo, what I've effectively\ndone is split my risk.\n\n382\n00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.285\nIf this guy gets compromised,\n\n383\n00:20:59.285 --> 00:21:02.491\nthen only the certificates\nthat he's issued are suspect.\n\n384\n00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:05.848\nAll of these certificates over\nhere are gonna be okay, right?\n\n385\n00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:08.120\nWe don't have to worry\nabout re-issuing those.\n\n386\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.110\nIf this guy, same thing, so\nyou see how we've kind of split that risk?\n\n387\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.830\nWe go into a three tier hierarchy,\nand again, we can split it even more.\n\n388\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.570\nNow, we don't split it up into five\ndifferent subordinates just for\n\n389\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:24.690\nrisk, but we do want to go\nbeyond that one tier for risk.\n\n390\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.880\nOnce we go beyond that one tier though,\nwe split it up primarily for\n\n391\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.070\na few different reasons.\n\n392\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:34.650\nCould be geographical, this could\nbe my CAN, my California office,\n\n393\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.840\nthis one is over my Florida office, or\nthis could be one for internal employees\n\n394\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.200\nand computers, this could be one for\ncontractors, so you might split it up for\n\n395\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.560\ngeographical purposes,\nit might be for issuing purposes.\n\n396\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.310\nIt might be for\nwhomever's it's issuing to, right?\n\n397\n00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.245\nOne different one for internal employees,\nand one for contractors.\n\n398\n00:21:56.245 --> 00:21:58.750\nCuz they could have different policies,\nright?\n\n399\n00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.770\nThe requirements for this one to issue\na certificate to a employee might be\n\n400\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.440\ndifferent from the policy that I have for\nissuing to contractors, contractors need\n\n401\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.880\nto provide a lot more information,\nso I can validate their identity.\n\n402\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.403\nWhereas employees, they've got\nan account on active directory,\n\n403\n00:22:12.403 --> 00:22:14.880\nthey've authenticated with their password,\nI know it's them,\n\n404\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.710\nI can just issue them a certificate,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.586\nSo, that's why we start splitting\nthese up in multiple levels.\n\n406\n00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:23.468\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, let me see if I can kind\nof explain my question, I guess I'm\n\n407\n00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:26.970\ngonna ask, because I notice in the single\ntier, you didn't call on an offline CA.\n\n408\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.450\nNow, my assumption is here,\nwe know you shouldn't assume,\n\n409\n00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.740\nis that because you still need\nthe health registration or\n\n410\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.525\nnot the health registration,\na completely different technology.\n\n411\n00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:36.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The registration authority,\n\n412\n00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:39.651\nyou still need the validity server,\nvalidation server, you can't just take\n\n413\n00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:42.680\nthat CA offline, or there's no way\nto check up on those certificates.\n\n414\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n415\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.730\nIf I brought up this guy offline, there'd\nbe no way for me to request a certificate.\n\n416\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.960\nOr to check, as you said,\n\n417\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.290\nthe validity of another certificate\nthat somebody was presenting me.\n\n418\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.665\nSo, that's not gonna work,\nhe's gonna have to stay online.\n\n419\n00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:57.130\nWhereas this system, or\nlet's go back to the two tier,\n\n420\n00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.460\ncuz it's simpler, and whereas this system,\nthis guy can be brought offline, oops,\n\n421\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.640\nforgot the arrows were attached there.\n\n422\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.350\nHe can be brought offline,\ncuz he doesn't need to be around.\n\n423\n00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:11.290\nWe'll export out, he's only issued two\ncertificates, one to each one of these,\n\n424\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:17.310\nand we can export his list of certificates\nthat he's issued, bring him offline.\n\n425\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.967\nThese guys stay online, and\ntheir certificate that they were issued\n\n426\n00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.322\nby the root gives them the authority\nto act on the roots behalf.\n\n427\n00:23:24.322 --> 00:23:28.450\nSo now I can rest request\na certificate from the issuing CA,\n\n428\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.102\neven though that root CAs not online.\n\n429\n00:23:31.102 --> 00:23:35.160\nAll right,\nwhich brings me back to the web of trust.\n\n430\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.350\nWhen we look at a certificate that\nwas issued to this user, what\n\n431\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.230\nwe'll see is let's say this is Wes, right,\nactually, let's make it a little taller.\n\n432\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.434\nNow it's Wes, all right, Wes is a big guy.\n\n433\n00:23:44.434 --> 00:23:49.440\nWell, that certificate says,\nissued to Wes Bryan,\n\n434\n00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.675\nissued by issuing CA, all right?\n\n435\n00:23:52.675 --> 00:23:57.058\nAnd what a validity, when you're checking\n\n436\n00:23:57.058 --> 00:24:01.685\nthe validity of these certificates, sorry.\n\n437\n00:24:01.685 --> 00:24:04.511\nWe're gonna follow this chain of trust.\n\n438\n00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:07.602\nSo, if Wes was present me that\ncertificate, I'm gonna look at it,\n\n439\n00:24:07.602 --> 00:24:10.570\nand I'm gonna say, okay,\nI trust all this information.\n\n440\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.660\nIt's issued to West Bryan,\nit was issued by issuing CA.\n\n441\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.080\nWho's issuing CA?\n\n442\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.010\nAnd then I'll get issuing CA certificate,\nand I'm gonna say issued two,\n\n443\n00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.170\nissuing CA, issued by root CA.\n\n444\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.300\nOkay, who's root CA?\n\n445\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.660\nAnd I'll go and\ntrace down this guy's certificate.\n\n446\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.820\nIssued to root, issued by root,\nthat's self-signed certificate.\n\n447\n00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:37.140\nLet me see, is that in my trusted root\ncertification authorities' folder,\n\n448\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.975\nand if it is, then I'll trust it.\n\n449\n00:24:38.975 --> 00:24:41.040\nHey, wait, what are you talking about?\n\n450\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.990\nWhat folder are you talking about?\n\n451\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.710\nWait, we haven't seen this.\n\n452\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.138\nLet's go take a look, all right?\n\n453\n00:24:45.138 --> 00:24:49.694\nI'm gonna jump over to, actually, I'm just\ngonna use my physical machine right here.\n\n454\n00:24:49.694 --> 00:24:53.940\nAll right, if I can get back to my desktop\nwith all these windows I have open.\n\n455\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.040\nI am going to, actually, you know what?\n\n456\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.690\nI'll use my VM.\n\n457\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.900\nRemember the other day\nwe had this Windows VM,\n\n458\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.110\nand we made this MMC in one\nof those previous episodes?\n\n459\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.270\nI'll just use that.\n\n460\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.859\nI'm gonna open that up, and I'm gonna\nadd a snap in, file, add remove snap in,\n\n461\n00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:12.572\nand I'm gonna choose\nthe certificate snap in.\n\n462\n00:25:12.572 --> 00:25:15.743\nThis is how you work with your\ncertificates that have been issued to you\n\n463\n00:25:15.743 --> 00:25:16.561\nor your machine.\n\n464\n00:25:16.561 --> 00:25:20.868\nI'll click add, and I'll work with my user\naccount, but because I'm an admin on this\n\n465\n00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:24.585\nmachine, I could also work with\ncertificates issued to the computer, but\n\n466\n00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:27.950\nI'll stick with user for now,\nI'll click Finish, and I click OK.\n\n467\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.383\nAnd in this council up here at the top,\nI'm gonna expand now certificates.\n\n468\n00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:37.620\nSlowly, it's thinking about it.\n\n469\n00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.585\nAnd I'm going to,\nnotice I've got this folder here called\n\n470\n00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:46.680\nTrusted Root Certification Authority,\nright?\n\n471\n00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.230\nAnd if I could expand that out and\n\n472\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.550\nclick on Certificates,\nthere's a list of certificates.\n\n473\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.480\nThese are root certificate servers.\n\n474\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.100\nThese are the tops of different\nhierarchies out there,\n\n475\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.730\ndifferent PKIs that my\nsystem knows to trust.\n\n476\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.560\nSo, if somebody presents me with\na certificate, and I can follow that chain\n\n477\n00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.760\nof trust back to one of these guys,\nI will trust the certificate, all right?\n\n478\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.070\nAgain, it's all about trust.\n\n479\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:16.150\nIf you trust the root,\nthen you'll trust every certificate issued\n\n480\n00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.270\nby that hierarchy,\neverything underneath it in that pyramid.\n\n481\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.700\nBut let's take a look here.\n\n482\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.091\nWe'll use my physical machine for\nthis one.\n\n483\n00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:27.650\nI'm gonna open up Chrome,\nand I'm here at Google, and\n\n484\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.783\ngood old Google has their https.\n\n485\n00:26:29.783 --> 00:26:32.956\nThat means this is a secure connection,\nwhich means they must\n\n486\n00:26:32.956 --> 00:26:36.670\nhave presented my system with\na certificate that I validated.\n\n487\n00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.060\nAnd now we've set up a secure channel.\n\n488\n00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.570\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthe little lock next to https.\n\n489\n00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:48.420\nAnd I'm gonna go View Details, and then\nI'm gonna look at the certificate itself.\n\n490\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.620\nSo, here's a little button\nthat says View Certificate.\n\n491\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.720\nRight, that tells me that Chrome took\nthe time to validate the certificate, and\n\n492\n00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.370\nmake sure everything was good,\n\n493\n00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.920\nbefore it allowed me to\ncreate the secure connection.\n\n494\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.510\nBut here's the certificate itself, and you\ncan see that it has different purposes.\n\n495\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.400\nI know that's really small, you know what?\n\n496\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.172\nI don't have my,\nlet's see if I can fire it up real quick.\n\n497\n00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:17.390\nWhere did you go?\n\n498\n00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.150\nZoomIt, let's see if we\ncan get that running.\n\n499\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.760\nAnd I can zoom in on our stuff.\n\n500\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.460\nMaybe it's running.\n\n501\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.020\nThere it is, how was that?\n\n502\n00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.370\nQuick response, all right.\n\n503\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.030\nSo there's the certificate.\n\n504\n00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.926\nYou can see, this certificate is\nintended for the following purposes.\n\n505\n00:27:34.926 --> 00:27:37.632\nEnsure the identity of a remote computer,\n\n506\n00:27:37.632 --> 00:27:41.624\nprovide your identity to a computer,\nissued to Google.com.\n\n507\n00:27:41.624 --> 00:27:48.519\nWildcard, anything.Google.com,\nissued by Google internet authority G2.\n\n508\n00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:53.260\nAnd there's my validity period down there,\n2016 to 2017.\n\n509\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.391\nRight, and\nif I click on certification path,\n\n510\n00:27:56.391 --> 00:28:01.690\nI can see that that certificate was\nissued again by Internet authority.\n\n511\n00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.400\nBut Internet authority is not\nthe top of the hierarchy.\n\n512\n00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.430\nI can actually work my way up the pyramid,\nthe very top is GeoTrust Global.\n\n513\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.812\nGeoTrust Global, who the heck is that?\n\n514\n00:28:12.812 --> 00:28:15.989\nAll right, well, let me zoom back out,\nand on my physical machine here,\n\n515\n00:28:15.989 --> 00:28:18.571\nI'm gonna create another\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n516\n00:28:20.928 --> 00:28:25.806\nIf it'll let me, and it's not, so let's do\nit in a different way, good old Windows\n\n517\n00:28:25.806 --> 00:28:30.740\n10, and its search doesn't like to\nfind a Microsoft Management Console.\n\n518\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.620\nSo, let me just create a certificate\nsnap in here, my physical machine\n\n519\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.130\nfor my user account, all right.\n\n520\n00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.390\nAnd what was that GeoTrust Global?\n\n521\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.370\nSo, I'm gonna expand our certificates.\n\n522\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.470\nI'm gonna expand out trusted\nroot certification authority,\n\n523\n00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.460\nI'm gonna click on certificates.\n\n524\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.420\nAnd I'm gonna look in this list, and\n\n525\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.520\nsure enough,\nI can't click on it while I'm zoomed in.\n\n526\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.870\nBut you should see about in the middle of\nthat screen, GeoTrust Global, all right?\n\n527\n00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.150\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n528\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:10.140\nAnd so if we look here, let's do this,\nwe'll pop that over there.\n\n529\n00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.719\nAnd we'll go back to, where's my browser?\n\n530\n00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:14.780\nOver here.\n\n531\n00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.060\nGeoTrust Global, I can select this,\nand I click View Certificate.\n\n532\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.900\nLet's start at the bottom.\n\n533\n00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.195\nLet's actually work our way up.\n\n534\n00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:24.030\nWe'll start with Google's,\nwhich we're actually looking at right now,\n\n535\n00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.070\nissued to Google,\nissued by Google Internet authority.\n\n536\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.360\nThe next one up says, okay,\nyou issued a Google, who are you?\n\n537\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.900\nIssue to Google Internet authority,\nissued by GeoTrust.\n\n538\n00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.100\nOkay, and who is GeoTrust Global CA?\n\n539\n00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.240\nNotice this one.\n\n540\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.900\nIssued to GeoTrust Global CA Issued\nby GeoTrust Global CA.\n\n541\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.520\nThere's one of those root CA certificates.\n\n542\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.088\nThere's nobody higher in\nthis particular hierarchy.\n\n543\n00:29:55.088 --> 00:29:57.010\nIt's a self-signed certificate.\n\n544\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.350\nSo, we have worked our way all the way\nup to the top of the hierarchy.\n\n545\n00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:04.440\nNow, the question is,\ndo I trust GeoTrust Global CA?\n\n546\n00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.516\nAnd, again, if we go back over to our MMC.\n\n547\n00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:12.964\nAnd we take a look,\nthere is GeoTrust Global CA, and\n\n548\n00:30:12.964 --> 00:30:17.130\nit is in my trusted root\ncertification authorities.\n\n549\n00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.935\nI trust GeoTrust Global, therefore,\n\n550\n00:30:19.935 --> 00:30:25.212\nI trust all certificates that were\nissued by that particular hierarchy.\n\n551\n00:30:25.212 --> 00:30:29.525\nAll right, now,\nthis is what we call a public hierarchy,\n\n552\n00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:32.351\npublic, what's a good way to say it?\n\n553\n00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:33.879\nA public CA.\n\n554\n00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:37.244\nThere's public CA, some private CAs,\nI'm getting enough of the wave, so\n\n555\n00:30:37.244 --> 00:30:39.201\nlet me finish up this\nthought process here.\n\n556\n00:30:39.201 --> 00:30:43.243\nSo, when we look at certificate\nauthorities, or public instructors,\n\n557\n00:30:43.243 --> 00:30:48.070\ntheir can be some, you can do an internal\nCA, you can have external or public CAs.\n\n558\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.550\nCompanies like VeriSign,\nThawte, Equifax, GeoTrust,\n\n559\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.400\nlike this one here,\nthese are what we call public CAs.\n\n560\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.930\nAnd the advantage of using a public CA\nto get your certificate is the fact that\n\n561\n00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.840\nevery operating system out there\nknows to trust them by default.\n\n562\n00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.050\nI didn't have to do anything.\n\n563\n00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.160\nMy operating system came with this list,\nor\n\n564\n00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.580\nmy browser actually came with this list of\ntrusted certificate authorities, right?\n\n565\n00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.700\nSo that way, when I go to Google,\nmy computer doesn't say, whoa,\n\n566\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.490\nwho the heck is this?\n\n567\n00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.700\nWell, or, same thing if my website.\n\n568\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.860\nWhat if I wanted to run\nan e-commerce site?\n\n569\n00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.230\nI'm gonna wanna get\na certificate from a public CA.\n\n570\n00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.020\nSo that when Wes visits my site,\nhe doesn't get any crazy warnings.\n\n571\n00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.770\nWhat if I ran my own internal CA,\nMike's certificate authority?\n\n572\n00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.400\nAnd I issued a certificate to my\nweb server, so that you could come,\n\n573\n00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.310\nI could set up HTTPS, and\nyou could come buy my product.\n\n574\n00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.890\nSo, you browse through my website, and\nyou go to hit your shopping cart, and\n\n575\n00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:46.300\nit switches over to HTTPS, and\nyou get this big warning that says, hey,\n\n576\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.720\nthis certificate can't be trusted.\n\n577\n00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.910\nIt was issued by Mike CA.\n\n578\n00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.370\nAnd basically,\nyour computer looked in this list and\n\n579\n00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.760\nsaid, there is no Mike CA in that list.\n\n580\n00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.000\nAre you going to buy a product from me?\n\n581\n00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.810\nProbably not.\n\n582\n00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.130\nBecause now,\nyou don't trust this secure connection.\n\n583\n00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.690\nSo, we take advantage of both public and\nprivate CAs.\n\n584\n00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.670\nPublic CAs for\n\n585\n00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.480\nwhen we need certificates that are gonna\nbe presented to the general public,\n\n586\n00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.640\nprivate CAs though, they cost money,\nthose public CAs and I'll tell you what.\n\n587\n00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.010\nLet's go ahead and stop there, so\nI don't have to rush through this.\n\n588\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.170\nWe'll come back and do another part, and\n\n589\n00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.790\nI'll show you how we go about\npurchasing certificates.\n\n590\n00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.560\nAnd I'll show you how we can create\nour own certificates internally, and\n\n591\n00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.820\nwe'll talk a little bit\nmore about the difference.\n\n592\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n593\n00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.920\nAnd usually I ask you, well, do you wanna\ngo ahead and bring this one to a stop, or\n\n594\n00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.150\ndo you got anything you wanna throw in?\n\n595\n00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.100\nWell, I guess he's already told us, so\n\n596\n00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.550\nit looks like we are gonna\ngo into a part two.\n\n597\n00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.210\nSo Mike, thank you for being here.\n\n598\n00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.160\nLook forward to part two, cuz I know\nwe got a lot of great more topics.\n\n599\n00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.879\nPlease come back and see us here.\n\n600\n00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:47.843\nSigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n601\n00:32:47.843 --> 00:32:48.479\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n602\n00:32:48.479 --> 00:32:51.110\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n603\n00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:56.978\n[MUSIC]\n\n604\n00:32:56.978 --> 00:33:00.260\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.022\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:14.294\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:19.242\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:23.130\nGIAC Security Essentials, or\nGSEC essentials for short here.\n\n7\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.940\nAnd we're coming back with a part two.\n\n8\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.790\nJoining us in the studios today is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.118\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\nThanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.440\nAnd yeah, we got to talk a little bit more\nabout good old public key infrastructure.\n\n12\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.040\nSo let's just continue\nright where we left off.\n\n13\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.380\nI was talking about the difference\nbetween a public CA and a private CA.\n\n14\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.275\nRight, a public CA, that's a third party,\nsomebody like Verisign or Thought or\n\n15\n00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.410\nEquifax, and there's dozens and\ndozens of them out there.\n\n16\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.300\nThese are places that you and I can go,\nand we can purchase certificates.\n\n17\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.990\nRight, they've got their own\npublic key infrastructure set up.\n\n18\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.880\nWe can go to them and we can say,\nhey, I need a certificate for SSL.\n\n19\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.170\nCuz I wanna set up a website,\nI wanna provide a secure connection and\n\n20\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.510\nthey will verify my identity, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.561\nI'm gonna have to provide\nall kinds of informations so\n\n22\n00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.230\nthat they can verify who I am.\n\n23\n00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.728\nAnd depending on the types of certificate\nwe might do this electronically,\n\n24\n00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:16.501\nheck some certificate you might have to\nactually physically go somewhere to prove\n\n25\n00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.280\nyour identity.\n\n26\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.440\nMaybe not their location, but kind of\nlike Wes did with the whole passport, and\n\n27\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.470\nmaybe do a proxy, but\n\n28\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.260\na lot of times you have to physically\ngo somewhere to identify yourself.\n\n29\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.990\nBut either way, you're go into a public\nentity, you're buying a certificate, and\n\n30\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.060\nthey're giving you that certificate, then\nyou can install it on your server, and\n\n31\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.340\nopen up your little web, e-commerce place.\n\n32\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.980\nWhy would I do that, because again\nI don't have to worry about trust.\n\n33\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.500\nBecause I know that all those machines out\nthere in the world that wanna buy, that\n\n34\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.030\nthey wanna use to come to my website and\nbuy my product are gonna trust VeriSign.\n\n35\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.450\nSo therefore when they get\npresented the certificate.\n\n36\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.176\nAnd their computer in the background\nfollows that chain of trust.\n\n37\n00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:58.446\nAll right, the certificate\nwas issued to Mike's website,\n\n38\n00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:01.240\nit was issued by some\nintermediate provider.\n\n39\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.920\nThat intermediate provider certificate\nwas issued by GeoTrust, and\n\n40\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.670\nin my list, yep, I trust GeoTrust.\n\n41\n00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.190\nTherefore I trust the certificate,\nand bada bing,\n\n42\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.590\nthey've set up SSL,\nnow they can buy your product.\n\n43\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.940\nAnd all that's happening\nin the background, right?\n\n44\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.860\nNothing the user is actually doing.\n\n45\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.710\nThey're just going to your website and\nall of a sudden boom, they get a little\n\n46\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.470\ngreen lockup there in the corner, and\nnow they've got a secure connection.\n\n47\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.850\nA privacy aid is one that I run internally\nI can take a Windows machine for\n\n48\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.820\nexample, and I can install\nthe certification authority role, and\n\n49\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.610\nI can now start issuing certificates.\n\n50\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.363\nBut the downside is as I've said if I\nissue a certificate to my web server, and\n\n51\n00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:43.448\nthen somebody from the public\ngoes to my website.\n\n52\n00:02:43.448 --> 00:02:47.118\nThey're gonna try to follow that chain\nof trust issued to Mike's web server,\n\n53\n00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:49.742\nissued by Mike's CA let me\nlook at my trusted root list.\n\n54\n00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:51.774\nNope, there's no mike CA,\n\n55\n00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:57.480\nI don't trust the root therefore I\ndon't trust anything underneath it.\n\n56\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.411\nNow I'm gonna get that big fat warning in\nmy browser saying you better not continue\n\n57\n00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.074\nthe site who knows who the heck these\npeople are but you better not trust them.\n\n58\n00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:09.005\n&gt;&gt; Mike on that concept of trust,\n\n59\n00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.721\nwhat I'm hearing here is\nessentially that model of trust,\n\n60\n00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:18.020\nit sounds like it's what can make or break\nsecure, unsecure ecommerce worldwide.\n\n61\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.760\nSo that model of trust seems like\nit's everything that we use,\n\n62\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.220\nreally to secure ecommerce\naround the entire world.\n\n63\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n64\n00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.510\nAnd you've probably seen some attacks, or\n\n65\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.040\nsome recent issues with some of these\nbig global CA's that were compromised.\n\n66\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.884\nAnd didn't try to hide it.\n\n67\n00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:38.650\nI think you were telling me\nthe story about, who was that?\n\n68\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.216\nWes, tell us that story.\n\n69\n00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:40.610\n&gt;&gt; That was DigiNotar.\n\n70\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.806\nYeah, it was a couple\nof them that happened.\n\n71\n00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.932\nAnd one's still in business,\nwhile on is no longer in business.\n\n72\n00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:48.127\nAnd it's a external CA,\nlike Mike's shown us here,\n\n73\n00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.620\nprobably at one time was in the list.\n\n74\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.647\nGot compromised and rather than doing due\ndiligence and just letting everybody know,\n\n75\n00:03:54.647 --> 00:03:58.066\nthey tried to sweep it under the rug and\nthen finally when it came to light,\n\n76\n00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:00.292\nwell I don't think their\nin business anymore.\n\n77\n00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, a public CA,\ntheir business is all based on trust.\n\n78\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.014\nIf they lose that they\nlose their business.\n\n79\n00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.853\nWhose gonna buy a certificate\nfrom somebody that\n\n80\n00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:16.230\nisn't trustworthy I mean that's\nthe whole point of this all right.\n\n81\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.240\nSo and again back to the private\nCA that wouldn't work because\n\n82\n00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.810\npeople are gonna come to my website and\nthey're not gonna trust\n\n83\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.100\nthe CA that's issued these certificates\ntherefore they're gonna get a big warning.\n\n84\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.000\nAnd most people are smart enough when\nthey get that warning to click no and\n\n85\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.590\nnot go ahead and go to the website.\n\n86\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.550\nWe'll go buy this from somebody else.\n\n87\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.200\nSomewhere that I can set\nup a secure connection.\n\n88\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.290\nSo why even have private CAs?\n\n89\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.430\nWell because internally they're just fine.\n\n90\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.810\nIf I have a user that's connecting\nto one of my file servers, and\n\n91\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.870\nthey need to set up\nthat secure connection.\n\n92\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.760\nAnd I've issued certificates\nto my file servers,\n\n93\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.380\nI've issued certificates to my users.\n\n94\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.754\nI can tell them to trust my CA, right?\n\n95\n00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:54.420\nThis is Mike's company.\n\n96\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.690\nAnd all of the machines on my\nnetwork know to trust Mike CA.\n\n97\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.830\nAll the employees from Mike's\ncompany know to trust Mike's CA.\n\n98\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.860\nSo internally, it's just fine, right?\n\n99\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.060\nI can use things like group policy to push\nout the root certificate for Mike's CA.\n\n100\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.040\nI can install that root certificate on\neverybody's machine in that trusted root\n\n101\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.770\nfolder, and now there machines\nwill automatically trust it.\n\n102\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.712\nSo internally it's find.\n\n103\n00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:18.320\nAnd that saves me money.\n\n104\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.380\nI don't have to buy a certificate\nfrom Verisign or thought for\n\n105\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.280\nevery single employee.\n\n106\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.870\nThat starts getting expensive.\n\n107\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.020\nAnd those certificates are only good for\na year or two years.\n\n108\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.110\nSo I've got a renewal.\n\n109\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.860\nI've got continued costs\non those certificates.\n\n110\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.020\nSo we use both.\n\n111\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.190\nTypically, we use the public\nCAs when I've got a resource.\n\n112\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.748\nThat's accessible by the public and\nI need that trust.\n\n113\n00:05:38.748 --> 00:05:42.756\nI use internal CAs when I can\nissue certificates internally and\n\n114\n00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:47.534\nI can tell those people to trust them and\nI don't want that recurring cost.\n\n115\n00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:53.048\nNow, that's not to say that you\ncouldn't trust Mike's CA right?\n\n116\n00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:56.470\nWhat if I've got a business partner,\nand they need to come to my website and\n\n117\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.410\ncreate this secure connection,\nso they can order product?\n\n118\n00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.942\nMaybe they are a manufacturer and\nI'm a raw materials supplier.\n\n119\n00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:05.834\nAnd their sales people can\nconnect to me as a vendor and\n\n120\n00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.410\nput orders in for raw materials, right?\n\n121\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.480\nWell, again, I'm running a privacy A, and\n\n122\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.900\nmy certificates not gonna\nbe trusted automatically.\n\n123\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.040\nBut, they know me.\n\n124\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.430\nThey do business with me.\n\n125\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.440\nAnd I can send them my root CA certificate\nand they can install it on their machines.\n\n126\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.260\nThey can choose to add this unknown,\nprivacy A,\n\n127\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.530\nroot CA certificate,\nto their trusted root folder, right?\n\n128\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.010\nThey can import that certificate, and\n\n129\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.220\nthey can tell all the machines on their\nnetwork, if they choose to, to trust it.\n\n130\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.980\nAnd now they will.\n\n131\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.280\nWhen they go to my site,\nthey won't get that nasty warning,\n\n132\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.520\ncuz their computer's gonna look and\nit's in that trusted root.\n\n133\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.920\nSo it's not to say that internal CAs or\n\n134\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.790\nprivate CAs can't be trusted\nIt's just extra work.\n\n135\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.930\nAnd I can't go to the general public and\nsay hey come to my website, it's secured.\n\n136\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.870\nBy the way,\ninstall this certificate right?\n\n137\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.930\nThat's not gonna fly.\n\n138\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.340\nBut if it was a business partner or\na subsidiary or\n\n139\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.720\nsomething like that,\nmaybe we swap certificates.\n\n140\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.448\nWe trust yours, you trust ours.\n\n141\n00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:07.259\nThat's the kind of thing you'll see\nin these corporate environments.\n\n142\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.330\nSo anyway, I think good on that, as long\nas we understand public and private.\n\n143\n00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.060\nAnd advantages and disadvantages.\n\n144\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.830\nLet me show you real quick.\n\n145\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.370\nIf I go out to the web.\n\n146\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.110\nLet me close this out real quick.\n\n147\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.470\nAnd I can go to somebody like.\n\n148\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.830\nWhat's a good one?\n\n149\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.532\nSymantec, who recently, oops,\nif I could spell that right,\n\n150\n00:07:31.532 --> 00:07:36.050\nbought, or I don't how that worked,\nI didn't pay attention to the details.\n\n151\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.172\nBut I just noticed that VeriSign\nis now owned by Symantec.\n\n152\n00:07:39.172 --> 00:07:41.900\nI don't know that could have been\na while and I just didn't notice it.\n\n153\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.170\nBut anyway, here's Symantec's website and\nyou can see that I can go in and\n\n154\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.210\nI could purchase certificates,\ndepending on what I want.\n\n155\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.350\nAnd look at those prices.\n\n156\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.318\nOne year for\nan SSL Certificate it costs me $399.\n\n157\n00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:55.648\nTwo years costs me $699.\n\n158\n00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:59.768\nSo I only have to renew it every two years\ninstead of every year, but you can see,\n\n159\n00:07:59.768 --> 00:08:01.194\nagain, not free, right?\n\n160\n00:08:01.194 --> 00:08:03.120\nIt is gonna cost me money.\n\n161\n00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.616\nBut what I'm paying for\nis not the certificate really.\n\n162\n00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:08.640\nI mean I am getting the certificate.\n\n163\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.110\nWhat I'm paying for is the fact that,\n\n164\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.130\nthat certificate is already\ntrusted by most people out there.\n\n165\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.201\nSo I don't have to worry\naboutexplaining to people,\n\n166\n00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.785\njust install root CA ccertificate.\n\n167\n00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:22.935\nI swear it'll be okay.\n\n168\n00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.915\nSome of you have probably dealt with this.\n\n169\n00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:28.390\nIf you've ever had a company\nthat set up a mail server.\n\n170\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.450\nAnd you're able to check\nyour mails remotely.\n\n171\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.890\nSo you go home you open up OWA and you go\nto connect to your company's mail server\n\n172\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.980\nand it gives this server warning and\nit says the certificate is not valid or\n\n173\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.040\ncan't be trust up to your route,\ndo you wanna continue and\n\n174\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.200\nyour IT department say just click\ncontinue and go ahead Right?\n\n175\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.510\nBecause they know it\nreally is their server and\n\n176\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.890\nthere's nothing wrong with you accepting\nthat certificate and going on.\n\n177\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.820\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n178\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.150\nSo if you've seen that,\nyou've seen that process, and\n\n179\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.609\nthat's not something you\nwant your customers to see.\n\n180\n00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:00.961\nAll right.\n\n181\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.780\nArl ight, so that is good for that.\n\n182\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.320\nLast thing I want to talk about, I think,\n\n183\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.680\nI told you I was going to\nshow you a private CA.\n\n184\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.090\nLet me do that real quick.\n\n185\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.610\nSo here on my VM I've got a server setup\nand I'm running certificate services.\n\n186\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.240\nSo I can open up certification authority.\n\n187\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.110\nSo, this is a role, again,\nthat I installed on this machine, and\n\n188\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.380\nit is my route CA, it's my one and\nonly I haven't really done a whole lo yet.\n\n189\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.590\nThe only thing I've issued is\nthat very first certificate.\n\n190\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.663\nBut if I double click on that,\nSee if I can get it to open,\n\n191\n00:09:32.663 --> 00:09:35.699\nsometimes they're a little slow\nthe first time, we'll take a peek.\n\n192\n00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:40.888\nMaybe, open up the properties\nof certificate and\n\n193\n00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:43.710\nyou'll see it's a self-signed certificate.\n\n194\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.140\nI'm sorry that's the certificate for\nthe actual domain controller.\n\n195\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.470\nLet's go up to here and\n\n196\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.680\npull up my properties, although that\nwould have been one to show you.\n\n197\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.350\nI'll go back to that one.\n\n198\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.300\nI should have shown you that.\n\n199\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.510\nSo I'm pulling up the properties\nof the root CA itself and\n\n200\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.780\neventually those were opened up.\n\n201\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.550\nCertificates services can be painfully\nslow when you first open things.\n\n202\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.700\nIf I click on view certificate, this is\n\n203\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.570\nthe root CA certificate so it should\nbe issued to root, issued by root.\n\n204\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.305\nThere we go.\n\n205\n00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:21.623\nRoot-CA, issued to, issued by, Root-CA.\n\n206\n00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:23.716\nAll right?\n\n207\n00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:24.762\nYeah.\n\n208\n00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:25.670\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask.\n\n209\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.490\nYou mentioned that term, self-signed.\n\n210\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.100\nCan you tell me a little bit about that?\n\n211\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.210\nIt almost sounds like a joke,\nlike we used to trust this because, well,\n\n212\n00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.650\nI told you you should trust us.\n\n213\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.580\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n214\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.440\nI mean, it's a starting point for\nthe hierarchy.\n\n215\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.460\nThe problem is, there's nobody higher\nTo get the certificate signed from.\n\n216\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.380\nSo who signs.\n\n217\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.910\nI was trying to give a good analogy for\nthat one.\n\n218\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.410\n&gt;&gt; We'll take driver's license.\n\n219\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.980\nA Florida state's driver license,\nright, is issued by Florida.\n\n220\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.650\nWell, there really isn't\nanybody above Florida.\n\n221\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.990\nWhy does a police officer trust it?\n\n222\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.020\nWell ,were to said trust it.\n\n223\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah exactly.\n\n224\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.730\nSo that's just there's nobody it has to\nstart somewhere, the trust has to start.\n\n225\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.730\nAnd let me flip over to my other machine.\n\n226\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.830\nSo the client and\nI'll show you that as a client\n\n227\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.210\nI can open up a browser and\nI can actually browse to.\n\n228\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.173\nMy certificate authority.\n\n229\n00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:19.935\nYou can see up there dc01/certserve,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:21.583\nAnd I can request a certificate.\n\n231\n00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:25.542\nNow my user account only has permissions\nto request user certificates.\n\n232\n00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:29.338\nBut I could set it up so\nthat we can request SSL certificates or\n\n233\n00:11:29.338 --> 00:11:31.020\nEFS certificates.\n\n234\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.790\nAnd I haven't completely configured this.\n\n235\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.423\nI just did this this morning for our demo.\n\n236\n00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:39.250\nSo you can see it's not going to\nallow me to request a certificate.\n\n237\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.580\nBecause I'm not connecting securely\nto the certificate authority.\n\n238\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.740\nI wanna make sure that\ntraffic is protected.\n\n239\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.360\nSo what I need to do first is issue an SSL\ncertificate to the certificate authority\n\n240\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.055\nitself and install that on my website and\nthen I can come back.\n\n241\n00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:57.435\nBut you could also use Group Policy, is\nanother way that I can issue certificates\n\n242\n00:11:57.435 --> 00:12:00.585\nout to all of my users or\nall of my computers.\n\n243\n00:12:00.585 --> 00:12:04.405\nOther thing I'll show you while we're\nhere is going to be the revocation.\n\n244\n00:12:04.405 --> 00:12:06.725\nRemember I said that\ncertificates can be revoked.\n\n245\n00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:10.727\nIf for any reason the certificate is\ncompromised before the end of its validity\n\n246\n00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:13.099\nperiod, before the actual expiration date.\n\n247\n00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:18.462\nWe revoke the certificate and then it will\nshow up here in what's call the CRL or\n\n248\n00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:21.240\na Certificate Revocation List.\n\n249\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.200\nEvery CA maintains a list of\ncertificates that is issued.\n\n250\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.840\nAnd if I wanted to revoke a certificate,\n\n251\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.200\nI'm not going to because this is\nan important one from my network here.\n\n252\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.100\nI could right click on it, all tasks and\nchoose revoke certificate.\n\n253\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.770\nSo let's say an employee left the company\nAnd I didn't want them trying to reconnect\n\n254\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.680\nto our mail server now that\nthey've left the company, right?\n\n255\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.200\nOr maybe that certificates loaded up\non a smart card, we let them go but\n\n256\n00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.120\nthey didn't have their smart\ncard with them, it was at home.\n\n257\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.660\nI don't want them sneaking\nback in the building tonight\n\n258\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.150\ntrying to reek havoc because they're\nupset because they got terminated, right?\n\n259\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.310\nSo how do I prevent that?\n\n260\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.370\nYou go in and you revoke the certificate.\n\n261\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.450\nNow when the present that certificate, ie,\nslide it in a card reader at the door to\n\n262\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.480\nget in, it's gonna validate\nthe certificate, it's going to check\n\n263\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.170\nwith the issuing CA, it's gonna see\nthat on the certificate revocation list\n\n264\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.130\nthat certificate is listed and it's going\nto be, it's not going to be accepted.\n\n265\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.700\nIn fact, I can show you a revocation list.\n\n266\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.410\nWhere's my console over here?\n\n267\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.082\nYou know I could go to let's\nsee where we're at, untrusted,\n\n268\n00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:25.213\nthat's not what I'm looking for.\n\n269\n00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:31.550\nWhere is it?\n\n270\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.570\nI think I hid it under here.\n\n271\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.350\nHere's one.\n\n272\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.590\nUnder intermediate here's\nour certificate authority.\n\n273\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.980\nCertification ratification list.\n\n274\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.600\nI could double click.\n\n275\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.740\nThis is one from Verisign, and\n\n276\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.910\nthere is three certificates on\nhere that have been revoked.\n\n277\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.470\nNow you don't see the information,\nall you see is the thumbprint.\n\n278\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.600\nBut if anybody tries to present one of\nthese certificates to your computer,\n\n279\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.290\nyour computer's gonna say, uh-uh.\n\n280\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.450\nYou're on the revocation list.\n\n281\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.030\nI am not accepting that\ncertificate as proof of identity.\n\n282\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.190\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting Mike, you were on\nthat one certificate and you almost like,\n\n283\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.230\nyou're sliding, right before you fall off\nthe cliff there, and you're like, no,\n\n284\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.320\nI don't want to do that.\n\n285\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.070\nWell, if you revoke a certificate,\nwhy don't you just reinstate it?\n\n286\n00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.220\n&gt;&gt; It's a great idea but\nunfortunately you can't.\n\n287\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.940\nOnce a certificate is revoked,\n\n288\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.910\nthere's several reasons you\ncan revoke a certificate.\n\n289\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.370\nCompromised, left the business\nbasically codes you can put in when you\n\n290\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.340\nchose to revoke it and it really doesn't\nmatter which one you choose because\n\n291\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.990\nin the end revoke is revoked, its just for\ndocumentation, except for one there is\n\n292\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.770\na what you call it a certificate hold,\nso lets say Wes was going to leave for\n\n293\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.650\n2 months, I didn't want his smart car\nbeing used because I know hes bot going\n\n294\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.430\nto be here I could actually go in and\nput her certificate on hold and\n\n295\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.750\nthat would no longer be accepted so\nsomebody found his card and tried to use\n\n296\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.720\nit to authenticate it wouldn't accept\nit but its not actually revoked so\n\n297\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.140\nonce Wes came back I could take it off\nof hold and it would still be good.\n\n298\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.810\nAny other revocation that you do to it,\n\n299\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.090\nif you revoke it for any other reason its\npermanent, once you revoke it It's done.\n\n300\n00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:02.140\nI can reissue a certificate and\nreplace it with a new one.\n\n301\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.960\nBut I cannot unrevoke\na revoked certificate.\n\n302\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.820\nAll right,\nlast thing I want to talk about with PKI.\n\n303\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.790\nBecause we've talked about\njust about every aspect of it.\n\n304\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.620\nIs something known as key escrow.\n\n305\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.330\nAnother important term here.\n\n306\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.720\nNow remember,\nback to the beginning of these episodes.\n\n307\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.050\nI said that the purpose of a certificate\nis to verify your identity or\n\n308\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.730\nthe identity of a service or\na computer or a person.\n\n309\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.050\nBut it's tying an identity to a key pair.\n\n310\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.790\nThat's really the big\nthing that it's doing.\n\n311\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.630\nWell, those keys need to be protected,\nright?\n\n312\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.490\nWe talked about it with encryption We\ntalked about how they worked together.\n\n313\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.310\nWhat if I did this?\n\n314\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.370\nWhat if I used my public key,\n\n315\n00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.280\nmy certificate,\nto encrypt a bunch of documents.\n\n316\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.720\nThe only key that can decrypt it\nnow is the matching private key.\n\n317\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.170\nThe other half of the key pair.\n\n318\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.190\nWhat if I lose that private key?\n\n319\n00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.510\nCan I still access those documents?\n\n320\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.300\nWhat do you think, Wes?\n\n321\n00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.932\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that you've just like\nkind of you said with the certification\n\n322\n00:15:56.932 --> 00:15:57.445\nrevocation.\n\n323\n00:15:57.445 --> 00:16:00.582\nI mean, it's gone and\nyou actually lose access to your data.\n\n324\n00:16:00.582 --> 00:16:01.316\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n325\n00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:04.206\nthe only key that can decrypt it\nwas the other half of the key pair.\n\n326\n00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:05.564\nAnd if I lose that key.\n\n327\n00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:06.991\nI am not getting back in.\n\n328\n00:16:06.991 --> 00:16:08.107\nYou can't call Microsoft.\n\n329\n00:16:08.107 --> 00:16:09.848\nYou can't try to break into these files.\n\n330\n00:16:09.848 --> 00:16:13.763\nIt is gonna be near impossible to\nget access to that information,\n\n331\n00:16:13.763 --> 00:16:16.410\nwhich is why we have to\nkeep those keys safe.\n\n332\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.340\nWe have to back those keys up.\n\n333\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.650\nWe have to store them in other locations.\n\n334\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.700\nWe have what we call key recovery\nagents in a Windows environments as\n\n335\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.150\nother environments as well.\n\n336\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.910\nAnd that's somebody that can go in and\n\n337\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.060\nrecover keys from a secure\nstorage location.\n\n338\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.690\nSo when I issue Wes a key,\nand a certificate, and\n\n339\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.370\na private key, I typically take a copy of\nthat information if it's set up properly,\n\n340\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.920\nand store it in another place.\n\n341\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.090\nAnd if Wes ever comes to me and\nsays hey, I lost my key.\n\n342\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.500\nMy hard drive got formatted.\n\n343\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.550\nMy hard drive failed, and I can't get\naccess to my private key anymore.\n\n344\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.820\nWell, I can go in as\nthe key recovery agent and\n\n345\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.880\npull out a copy of his key and\nsay here you go.\n\n346\n00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.240\nI can replace his lost key and\nnow he can access those.\n\n347\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.630\nAnd now he can access those documents.\n\n348\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.800\nSo keeping those keys\nsafe is very important.\n\n349\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.920\nBut I want to differentiate between\nkey recovery, key archival,\n\n350\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.030\nbasically, keeping track of those keys,\nkeeping backups of them.\n\n351\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.870\nVersus key escrow, right?\n\n352\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.520\nKey archival and key recovery is when,\nme, I, as a company, right?\n\n353\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.860\nMy own keys that I've issued to Wes and\nall my employees.\n\n354\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.170\nI'm keeping the backup of those,\nand I'm keeping them safe.\n\n355\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.300\nAnd if anything happens,\nI can recover one.\n\n356\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.370\nKey escrow is when we\nintroduce a third party,\n\n357\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:34.490\nnow a third party wants to get access\nto my encrypted information and\n\n358\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.120\nI may store, I can store a copy of those\nkeys I can give them basically a copy of\n\n359\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.030\nmy private keys so that anytime\nif they need to, they can access.\n\n360\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.178\nThis is done for basically for\nlaw enforcement, all right?\n\n361\n00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:52.720\nThe U.S Government recently, in the last\nfew years, has made a big stink about it.\n\n362\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.660\nYou've probably, no matter where\nyou're from, you've probably heard it,\n\n363\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.830\nbecause they wanted access to\nbasically the master keys.\n\n364\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.110\nThe keys to the kingdom.\n\n365\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.370\nThey felt like in order to keep us safe,\nthey should be able to decrypt\n\n366\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.020\nany encrypted information\ntraveling across the Internet.\n\n367\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.790\nAnd they wanted access to all\nthe keys that all of these big\n\n368\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.110\npublic CAs had issued, right?\n\n369\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.243\nYeah, that didn't fly too well.\n\n370\n00:18:16.243 --> 00:18:21.630\nThis is not something that most people\nwant to give up, so it didn't work out.\n\n371\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.480\nPlus logistically it would be a nightmare.\n\n372\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.510\nSo just the infrastructure we have in\nplace today is really not set up for that.\n\n373\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:32.890\n&gt;&gt; So is the key escrow akin to like\nmaybe a safety deposit box for your keys?\n\n374\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.070\nI mean, obviously there's checks and\nbalances.\n\n375\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.940\nNot just anybody can go into\na safety deposit box but\n\n376\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.690\nyou're basically handing\nthat over to somebody else.\n\n377\n00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and the key here is\nto understand that it's a third party.\n\n378\n00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.330\nIt's not the organization itself.\n\n379\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.840\nThere's nothing wrong with, you know,\n\n380\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.950\nwe wouldn't call it key escrow,\nif I'm keeping the keys safe.\n\n381\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.270\nIt's when I need to put them in a place,\nthat a third party can get to them,\n\n382\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.850\nif they want too, Like if I get\na subpoena from a law enforcement agency,\n\n383\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:02.140\nthey can go to this key escrow company and\nsay, we need Mike's companies keys,\n\n384\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.820\nso that we can access this particular\nemployee's encrypted data, right?\n\n385\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:12.560\nThat's what key escrow is about, is giving\naccess to a third party if they need it.\n\n386\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.520\nAnd it's got all kinds of issues.\n\n387\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.550\nBut I want you to understand the term,\nat least, for this particular exam.\n\n388\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.230\nUnderstand, too.\n\n389\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.360\nTypically, key escrow is\ndone in a what they call,\n\n390\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.780\nI don't know if I say multi-factor,\nbut where more than one person.\n\n391\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.426\nJoe at third party\ncompany can't just go and\n\n392\n00:19:30.426 --> 00:19:33.437\nsay I want Mike's keys cuz\nI suspect he's [SOUND].\n\n393\n00:19:33.437 --> 00:19:36.542\nIt would typically take,\nokay the third party has to be there,\n\n394\n00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.940\nsomebody from my company has to be there.\n\n395\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.450\nIt's almost like the missile silos\nwhere you have to put two keys in and\n\n396\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.570\nturn it to actually launch anything,\nif it's the same thing.\n\n397\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.590\nSomebody from me, my company, somebody\nfrom this escrow company, somebody from\n\n398\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.160\nthis law enforcement agency, all present,\nall agreed then they can get that key out.\n\n399\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.750\nSo, it's not like anybody\ncan just go get the key and\n\n400\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.490\ndecrypt all your information\nhopefully right [LAUGH].\n\n401\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.400\n&gt;&gt; Now here's what I thought,\nthere's a lot of technology behind\n\n402\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.698\nflipping a green little\nmarker in a web browser.\n\n403\n00:20:06.698 --> 00:20:10.420\nI thought it just a green light you flip\na switch but there's a lot that goes into\n\n404\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.940\nturning that little bar green there that's\na lot of good information on PKI now.\n\n405\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.390\nWe've got another topic that\nyou're gonna tackle here as well.\n\n406\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.260\nMike, can you tell us about that?\n\n407\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely!\nWe're gonna\n\n408\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.630\nshift away now from certificates,\nI think we've had enough of that.\n\n409\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.320\nWe're gonna talk about something\nknown as steganography.\n\n410\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.080\nI mean, all this really ties\nback into our encryption, right?\n\n411\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.218\nIn previous episodes, we talked about\nsymmetric and asymmetric in block and\n\n412\n00:20:33.218 --> 00:20:35.455\nstreams ciphers, now we talk about PKI.\n\n413\n00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:38.441\nBecause it's really a progression of,\nwe talked about the keys,\n\n414\n00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:40.880\nnow we know where those keys come from,\nright?\n\n415\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.440\nAnd that's from that\ncertificate authority.\n\n416\n00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.210\nNow I want to talk about steganography.\n\n417\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.970\nIt's really another form,\nI won't say encryption, per se.\n\n418\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:57.602\nSteganography is a way of hiding\ninformation in plain sight, all right.\n\n419\n00:20:57.602 --> 00:21:02.065\nIt's different from encryption we can\nactually combine steganography in\n\n420\n00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:06.315\nencryption and use steganography\nto hide encrypted information, but\n\n421\n00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:09.380\nunderstand they're two\nreally separate things.\n\n422\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.430\nBoth are ways to provide confidentiality,\nto hide information but\n\n423\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.820\nthey go about it in a much different way.\n\n424\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can recap\njust the encryption part here.\n\n425\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.930\nNow, encryption was a little\nbit different than stenography,\n\n426\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.530\nbecause you said we know the fact\nthat there's information there.\n\n427\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.540\nNow we can't read it, but\nwe know that the information's there.\n\n428\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.105\nNow you're saying steganography is we're\nhiding information in plain sight?\n\n429\n00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:35.835\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, one of the things\nabout encrypting a document is it draws\n\n430\n00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:37.075\nattention to it, right?\n\n431\n00:21:37.075 --> 00:21:39.965\nCuz you see it and\nyou see that it's encrypted.\n\n432\n00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.715\nAnd that can sometimes spur curiosity.\n\n433\n00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:45.635\nOoh, I wonder what's in there.\n\n434\n00:21:45.635 --> 00:21:49.145\nWhat is so important that they\ndecided they had to encrypt it, right?\n\n435\n00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:52.620\nSo just the act of encrypting\nit can draw attention to it and\n\n436\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.340\nput that information at risk.\n\n437\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.250\nNot that I wouldn't encrypt it, because\notherwise they could just take it and\n\n438\n00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.340\nread it in plain text.\n\n439\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.104\nSo I'm still going to encrypt it, but\n\n440\n00:22:01.104 --> 00:22:04.810\nto just understand that encryption does\nactually kind of draw attention to it.\n\n441\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.930\nIt makes it seem like there's\nsomething there worth hiding.\n\n442\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.560\nWhereas steganography you don't see it.\n\n443\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.530\nYou don't realize that it's there.\n\n444\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.890\nWe're talking about hiding in plain sight.\n\n445\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:22.092\nIf I remember my, if I can remember,\nit's Greek or Latin,\n\n446\n00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:26.575\nstegan meaning hidden,\ngraphi meaning writing.\n\n447\n00:22:26.575 --> 00:22:29.228\nSo hidden writing I think,\nif we look back at the entomology, or\n\n448\n00:22:29.228 --> 00:22:32.030\nhow is that I would say that,\nthe etymology of the word?\n\n449\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.120\nWould be like hidden writing.\n\n450\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.680\nBut it's not just writing.\n\n451\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.010\nSo how do we do this?\n\n452\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.550\nWell, in the electronic world,\nit's actually been done.\n\n453\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.740\nThis has been done way back,\nlike we talked about with encryption,\n\n454\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.390\nthis goes back to ancient Greeks and\nRomans and even before that.\n\n455\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.790\nThey talk about, I was reading\nan interesting one about some of the first\n\n456\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.530\nknown uses of steganography.\n\n457\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.900\nTook a servant, shaved their head,\n\n458\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.890\nwrote a message on their head, once their\nhair grew back, sent them on the way.\n\n459\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.740\nAnd told him say when this guy\ngets here shave his head and\n\n460\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.000\nI forget exactly how they put it.\n\n461\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.910\nBut kind of a secret way of saying,\n\n462\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.780\nhey you should shave this guy's head\nthere's a secret message up there, right?\n\n463\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.950\nObviously it took a long time I\nmean how long did it take for\n\n464\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.970\nthis guy's hair to grow back enough\nto hide the writing on his head.\n\n465\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.490\nBut interesting though, right?\n\n466\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.550\nThat is one of the earlier\nforms of steganography.\n\n467\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.690\nHiding it right there in plain sight.\n\n468\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.670\nYou see it today, everyday, printers\nrecently had started adding little\n\n469\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.860\nyellow dots in their paper\nthat have maybe model number,\n\n470\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.950\ndate information in there so when you look\nat a printed document you don't see it.\n\n471\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.420\nBut if you look close enough\nyou know where to look,\n\n472\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.130\nyou might find hidden\ninformation in there.\n\n473\n00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.257\nSo there's steganography\nin action right now.\n\n474\n00:23:52.257 --> 00:23:56.644\n&gt;&gt; Would that be an example of some of\nthe things we use here in the States and\n\n475\n00:23:56.644 --> 00:24:00.682\nmaybe in other countries out there\nto basically validate money?\n\n476\n00:24:00.682 --> 00:24:02.092\nWe don't look at it right away, but\n\n477\n00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:04.826\nI tell you there's some of those bills\nthat I can turn up in the light.\n\n478\n00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:05.604\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n479\n00:24:05.604 --> 00:24:08.339\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden there,\nI see a President's face that I didn't see\n\n480\n00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:10.300\noriginally when I was\nlooking directly at it.\n\n481\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.661\n&gt;&gt; Kind of,\nI don't know if it's quite the same.\n\n482\n00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:17.120\nBut it's definitely that concept\nof not being visible right away.\n\n483\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.430\nSo let's talk about steganography again.\n\n484\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.080\nThe idea here in the electronic world.\n\n485\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.210\nWe're not shaving anybody's head and\nwriting messages on top, or\n\n486\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.950\nanything like that.\n\n487\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.360\nBut what we'll do is we'll\ntake an electronic document.\n\n488\n00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.530\nAnd we'll dump information in there.\n\n489\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.800\nThe carrier files, like a picture or\n\n490\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.980\na video or a MP3, a song,\nor something like that.\n\n491\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.800\nWhen we look at the files, remember all\nfiles are just ones and zeros, okay?\n\n492\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.020\nAnd look at an image, for example.\n\n493\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:56.020\nIf it's a 24-bit color image, that means\nthere's 24 bits for specifying the color.\n\n494\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:02.070\nNow, that gives me,\nlet's see if we got 24 eight,\n\n495\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.659\n16, 24 that's like 16 miilion\n777,000 some odd possible colors.\n\n496\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.610\nIf I take take a couple of those least\nsignificant bits from that pixel.\n\n497\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.230\nThat pixel has 24 bits that tell\nyou what color to make this pixel.\n\n498\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.440\nIf I take the least significant bits and\nI take one or two of those bits off,\n\n499\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.860\nI could shove a couple\ncharacters in there.\n\n500\n00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.610\nAnd that will change the color but\nso insignificantly that you and\n\n501\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.910\nI are not gonna notice it,\nnot without extremely close observation.\n\n502\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.890\nI'm not talking about turning red to pink,\nright?\n\n503\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.980\nWith 16 million colors,\nhow many shades of red are there and\n\n504\n00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.600\nwould you be able to tell the difference\nbetween two images, all right?\n\n505\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.480\nAnd if you're out there saying yes,\nyou would, I'm gonna put you to the test.\n\n506\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.120\nLet's find out.\n\n507\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.480\nLet's do a little demonstration and\n\n508\n00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.280\njust see how much it can change\nthis information, all right?\n\n509\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.010\nAnd as I'm getting this set up,\ndon't look at my screen just yet.\n\n510\n00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.410\nDepending on the image,\n\n511\n00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.570\nthe color depth will determine how much\ndata you can shove in there and hide.\n\n512\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.990\nIf it's an MP3 file,\nlike a song there highs and\n\n513\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.340\nlows that the human ear can't hear.\n\n514\n00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.750\nSo we can actually take some of that\ninformation that falls out of the range of\n\n515\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.130\ncommon hearing, strip those bits out,\n\n516\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.580\nreplace it with our data and\nyou'll never be the wiser.\n\n517\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.320\nThe song will play just fine.\n\n518\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.120\nIt won't skip and\njump and sound all funny.\n\n519\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.800\nIf I did it in a video.\n\n520\n00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.860\nSame thing.\n\n521\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.930\nI can take some of those bits\nthat are used to specify color,\n\n522\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.280\nyou're never going to notice.\n\n523\n00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.060\nThat's the idea behind steganography.\n\n524\n00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:40.090\nInserting data into white space or\nremoving some of the bits and\n\n525\n00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:45.310\nreplacing it with other bits yet\nnot altering the original Image.\n\n526\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.660\nAll right, let me pull this.\n\n527\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.310\nLet me get rid some of this windows here.\n\n528\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.490\nOkay, go ahead,\nyou can show my screen now.\n\n529\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.830\nThere's several, several tools you can\nget, some of them free, some of them pay.\n\n530\n00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:59.380\nThis is the one I downloaded just a little\nwhile ago called Image Steganography.\n\n531\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.760\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nopen this guy up and\n\n532\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.390\nlet me just do a quick let\nme see if I can do a version\n\n533\n00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:12.210\ngive this guy credit CP,\nC pass code 2011 image steganography.\n\n534\n00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.700\nI can't remember the site I got\nit from but it's a free tool.\n\n535\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.520\nAnd what I'm gonna do Is it,\nlet me zoom in first so you can see this.\n\n536\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.620\nI've got a spot to drop\nan image up there at the top.\n\n537\n00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.670\nAnd then I can input data either a file,\nthat I could drag and\n\n538\n00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.020\ndrop on there, or text,\nI could just type data in.\n\n539\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.610\nAnd then my output image right, is what\nit's gonna spit out on the other end.\n\n540\n00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.090\nAnd I have the option,\nthere's a couple of options here, and\n\n541\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.320\nit's not important that we\nunderstand the different options.\n\n542\n00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.380\nEmbed, Enlarge, Difference.\n\n543\n00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.700\nI know, for example, Enlarge will\ndouble the size of the picture,\n\n544\n00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.170\nwhich will theoretically double the amount\nof space I have to store things in there.\n\n545\n00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.310\nYou can encrypt the contents\nbefore you dump it in.\n\n546\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.860\nSo if somebody does discover it, when they\npull it back out, it's actually encrypted.\n\n547\n00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.950\nStill doesn't do them any good.\n\n548\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.550\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n549\n00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.800\nAnd let's just see what happens.\n\n550\n00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.530\nSo here's an image here, that I've got,\nand I'll show you the images before and\n\n551\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.910\nafter here, in just a second.\n\n552\n00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.440\nI'm gonna drop this in, all right.\n\n553\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.290\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nput My secret information.\n\n554\n00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.780\nFor the output image,\nI'll dump it out to my desktop.\n\n555\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.255\nAnd I'll call it Stego output.\n\n556\n00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:33.190\nAnd I'll click Save,\nand I'll just do Embed.\n\n557\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.440\nAnd I'll encode it, and I'll click Start.\n\n558\n00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.570\nAll right, give it a second,\nand there is my new file.\n\n559\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.120\nI'll click Finish, and\nI'll just minimize this guy.\n\n560\n00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.990\nSo now I've got these two files,\nI've got my original image, and\n\n561\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.500\nI've got Stego output.\n\n562\n00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.310\nIf I open this up and put it on this side.\n\n563\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:00.890\nAnd I open up that other one and\ndump it on this side.\n\n564\n00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.830\nYou're really not gonna\ntell the difference.\n\n565\n00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.670\nNow in this case, I started with a JPEG.\n\n566\n00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.530\nSo not really fair, because\nthe output is gonna be a PNG file for\n\n567\n00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.070\nthis particular utility.\n\n568\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.480\nSo I could definitely tell the difference\nthere between the input and the output.\n\n569\n00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.790\nBut what if you didn't have the original?\n\n570\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.240\nOkay, that's the art of\nfinding information,\n\n571\n00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.240\nwe're detecting steganography.\n\n572\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.390\nReally, a lot of it depends on do you\nhave the original to compare it to.\n\n573\n00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.560\nBecause if I have the original,\nI can start looking at file sizes.\n\n574\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.280\nI can zoom into the pixel level maybe and\nstart comparing side by side.\n\n575\n00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.020\nThere's several techniques I can use\nto look at the actual ones and zeros,\n\n576\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.330\nand if I have the original.\n\n577\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.730\nBut if I don't have the original,\n\n578\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:49.150\nif I don't have anything to compare it to\nI'm gonna have an extremely difficult time\n\n579\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.410\ntrying to figure out if there's any\nbits in here that don't belong.\n\n580\n00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.510\nAnd if I take these random bits\nfrom all around on the image,\n\n581\n00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.530\nI can put it back together and\nget a message.\n\n582\n00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.490\nActually, that would be really,\nreally hard to do.\n\n583\n00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.310\nHow do I get it back out?\n\n584\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.960\nWell, you would need the original program.\n\n585\n00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.690\nIf I come back over here and\nI open up the image-steganography, and\n\n586\n00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.362\nI change this to Decode.\n\n587\n00:30:07.362 --> 00:30:09.440\nAnd okay, what do you wanna decode?\n\n588\n00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.040\nWell, I'm gonna put my hidden image here.\n\n589\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.590\nAnd I'll output text right here\nin the window so we can see it.\n\n590\n00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.510\nI've chosen Decode.\n\n591\n00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.170\nI click Start.\n\n592\n00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.480\nAnd look, there is my secret information.\n\n593\n00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.360\nSo this is a way that I can\nshuttle information in and\n\n594\n00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.100\nout without anybody being the wiser,\nhopefully.\n\n595\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.180\nOr, we can hide information in plain view.\n\n596\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.240\nNot that this is smart, but\n\n597\n00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.700\nI've known people that have kept\npassword lists in images, right?\n\n598\n00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.400\nAnd anybody that's\nlooking on that computer.\n\n599\n00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.480\nEven if somebody stole the computer and\nsees this folder of pictures.\n\n600\n00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.680\nThey might go, great,\nthis guy's got pictures of his dogs.\n\n601\n00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.800\nFantastic.\n\n602\n00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.520\nBecause they didn't know that hidden\nin that image are his passwords\n\n603\n00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.450\nto his bank account.\n\n604\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.690\nNow I'm not saying that's a great idea but\nthat's the kind of thing that we can do.\n\n605\n00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.540\nThis is how exfiltration of data\noccurs within organizations, right.\n\n606\n00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.240\nEven if you've got that sheep dip\nmachine or your not allowing for\n\n607\n00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.360\nany people bring thumb drives out,\nyou have to first plug it in.\n\n608\n00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.810\nOr you go through the airport,\nthey see your MP3 player and\n\n609\n00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.200\nthey look on it, they can play the songs.\n\n610\n00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.140\nThere's no government secrets in there.\n\n611\n00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.870\nThey're songs and they actually work.\n\n612\n00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.730\nHow are they going to know that hidden\nin that MP3 of whomever your favorite\n\n613\n00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.780\nartist is is actually the blueprints\nof the Death Star, right?\n\n614\n00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.260\nThey would never be the wiser.\n\n615\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.130\nThey wouldn't even know to look.\n\n616\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.280\nThat's the thing,\nit's hidden in plain sight.\n\n617\n00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.480\nIf you don't even know to look,\nit's not there, right?\n\n618\n00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.070\nOr you're not going to see it,\nI should say.\n\n619\n00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.280\nIt is there, you're just not gonna see it.\n\n620\n00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.020\nAnd it's not just a simple text file.\n\n621\n00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.390\nLet's find another one here.\n\n622\n00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.120\nThis is a picture,\n\n623\n00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.050\nthis is actually a demo image from\nthe people that make image steganography.\n\n624\n00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.020\nSo let's decode this one.\n\n625\n00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.670\nLooks like a picture,\nnothing wrong with it.\n\n626\n00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.800\nI open it up and\nit's a pretty picture of trees.\n\n627\n00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.790\nOkay, that's nice.\n\n628\n00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.254\nDoesn't look unusual.\n\n629\n00:31:55.254 --> 00:32:02.534\nBut if I drop it in here, and I go to\ndecode it, and I'll output this to a file.\n\n630\n00:32:02.534 --> 00:32:08.369\nAnd I'll put it on my desktop and\nI'll call it demo Output,\n\n631\n00:32:08.369 --> 00:32:13.284\nso we'll know what it is,\nand I'll click Start.\n\n632\n00:32:14.688 --> 00:32:18.000\nSee what pops up on Minus,\nwhat's this, demo output?\n\n633\n00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.185\nIt's a whole another picture\nwithin the picture, right?\n\n634\n00:32:22.185 --> 00:32:25.625\nSo it's not just one or two lines of text,\nit can take entire files,\n\n635\n00:32:26.895 --> 00:32:32.875\nI could take the, let's go back to\nEncode and drop this file back in there.\n\n636\n00:32:32.875 --> 00:32:39.175\nI could take this entire spreadsheet, drop\nit in there, oops, and put that as a file.\n\n637\n00:32:40.614 --> 00:32:46.300\nAnd drop that in there, output image\nagain on browse to my desktop,\n\n638\n00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.380\nand I'll call it something like ASDF,\nbut I'm not being creative.\n\n639\n00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:56.410\nEncode, Embed, Start, and\nthere we go, all right,\n\n640\n00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:02.250\nso now this picture, unbeknownst to you,\nhas an entire spreadsheet buried in it.\n\n641\n00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.010\nAll right, now again,\nif we start looking at file sizes,\n\n642\n00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.670\nwe can probably find the difference\nif you've got the original.\n\n643\n00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.127\nIf you don't,\nwhat are you gonna compare it to?\n\n644\n00:33:10.127 --> 00:33:14.495\nA couple of heads up about steganography,\nthe detection is steganalysis,\n\n645\n00:33:14.495 --> 00:33:19.070\nthat's what they would call the art\nof trying to detect steganography.\n\n646\n00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.260\nLooking at the least significant bits,\nlooking for anomalies,\n\n647\n00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.190\ncomparing it to the original, trying\nto find the original image or song or\n\n648\n00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.510\nwhatever, and comparing it.\n\n649\n00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.840\nThe other thing you wanna keep\nin mind is you wanna make sure,\n\n650\n00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.540\nif you're doing steganography,\nyou have to use Lossless.\n\n651\n00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.660\nAll right, like a JPEG, for example,\nthat's a lossy picture format,\n\n652\n00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.680\nit's compressed.\n\n653\n00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.383\nOr else you lose bits every time you\nsave and edit and save those JPEGs.\n\n654\n00:33:46.383 --> 00:33:50.036\nAnd when they compress it, it throws away\na lot of that white space and those extra\n\n655\n00:33:50.036 --> 00:33:53.950\nbits that we don't need, that's exactly\nwhere I'm hiding my information.\n\n656\n00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:58.459\nSo if you throw a hidden information into\na compressed format, when it saves it,\n\n657\n00:33:58.459 --> 00:34:01.340\nyou could very well corrupt the data\nyou're trying to hide in there, and\n\n658\n00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.050\nyou won't be to get it back out.\n\n659\n00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:09.405\nSo stay away from any type of compressed\nfiles, what else was I going to say?\n\n660\n00:34:09.405 --> 00:34:11.430\nYeah, so that's probably good for\n\n661\n00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:16.680\nsteganography, really cool concept,\nhiding information in plain sight.\n\n662\n00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.708\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information between PKI.\n\n663\n00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:23.676\nNow, we had a first part of this, remember\nif you maybe came to this episode and\n\n664\n00:34:23.676 --> 00:34:27.214\nwe were ending PKI, go back and\nwatch that first part and\n\n665\n00:34:27.214 --> 00:34:29.880\nthen come back and watch the second part.\n\n666\n00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.360\nNow, Mike, I know we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, but\n\n667\n00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.770\nI do wanna help you out here,\nI got your back on this.\n\n668\n00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:39.096\nThat website was\nimagesteganography.codeplex.com there.\n\n669\n00:34:39.096 --> 00:34:40.112\n&gt;&gt; Well played, sir, there we go.\n\n670\n00:34:40.112 --> 00:34:43.083\n&gt;&gt; I got you in the background there,\nbut before we sign out, Mike,\n\n671\n00:34:43.083 --> 00:34:46.054\ndo you got any additional words you\nmight wanna throw in here about\n\n672\n00:34:46.054 --> 00:34:48.260\npublic key infrastructure or\nsteganography?\n\n673\n00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.380\n&gt;&gt; No, Wes, I think that's good for now.\n\n674\n00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well as always, we\nappreciate having you in the studios, and\n\n675\n00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.860\nwe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n676\n00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.763\nSigning out right for ITProTV,\nI've been your

They look at the basics of cryptographic attacks such as ciphertext-only, known plaintext, chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks. They will also talk about cryptanalysis concepts like differential, linear, side channels  cryptanalysis and more. Finally, they will introduce the basics in a cryptographic technique called steganography.",

00:00:08.295\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.852\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRo.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.320\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're continuing through our GIAC\n\n7\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.030\nsecurity essentials and might have\nheard it as GSEC essentials for short.\n\n8\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.600\nAnd we're coming back with a part\nthree on PKI and stenography.\n\n9\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.780\nAnd joining us in the studios for\n\n10\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.870\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.780\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Doing great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.980\nAnd yeah, we got a little more to do\nwith cryptography if I can get that out,\n\n14\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740\nactually just a little bit, right?\n\n15\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.380\nI wanna go over some terms we've really\ncovered all the main concepts that we need\n\n16\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.575\nto be familiar with cryptography but\n\n17\n00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:53.665\nthere are some other terms we talk about\ncryptographic attacks or cryptanalysis.\n\n18\n00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.075\nWe talk about breaking cryptography.\n\n19\n00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:58.785\nHow the bad guys are gonna\ntry to attack our systems?\n\n20\n00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:03.440\nWe're using that cryptography to provide\nour confidentiality or integrity,\n\n21\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.620\nand what are some of the types of tax\nthat those systems can follow under?\n\n22\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.600\nAnd it's really just kinda learning these\nterms and being familiar with the fact\n\n23\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.000\nthat there are different types of tax that\ncan be launched against cryptosystems.\n\n24\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n25\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.932\nI've just typed up a few definitions for\nus we will go over them quickly and\n\n26\n00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.230\nagain, we are not getting\ninto cryptanalysis.\n\n27\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.116\nI am not one that is going to go and\nbreak encryption systems let say,\n\n28\n00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:34.220\na lot of work and it is a lot of math,\nyeah a lot of fun.\n\n29\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.374\nIt actually would be a pretty\ncool job wouldn't it?\n\n30\n00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:38.410\nSo.\nAll right, anyway,\n\n31\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.250\nlet's talk about what I've\ngot here on the screen.\n\n32\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.060\nWe've got Ciphertext Only type attacks,\nand the name pretty much implies it all.\n\n33\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.710\nThey're gonna have, the bad guys are gonna\nhave the Ciphertext, the output of our\n\n34\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.540\ncryptosystem, and they're gonna\ntry to infer from that information\n\n35\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.940\nwhat the plaintext is, or possibly\nwhat one of the keys are, all right?\n\n36\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.960\nThat was used to encrypt.\n\n37\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.880\nBecause of they can do that,\nthey can reverse engineer that algorithm.\n\n38\n00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.670\nThey can take that ciphertext turn it back\ninto plaintext, they're good to go, right?\n\n39\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.080\nThat's the whole goal of cryptoanalysis,\ntry to break that encryption and\n\n40\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720\nrecover the plain text out.\n\n41\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.750\nSo that's a tough one, right?\n\n42\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.880\nAll I have are the Ciphertext.\n\n43\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.160\nI might know the algorithms\nbeing used like\n\n44\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.680\nit was used in the AES or it was used in\ntriple desk or whatever the case was.\n\n45\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.370\nBut basically all I have is the Ciphertext\nand from that, I've got to try to work\n\n46\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.119\nmy way backwards and break that\ncryptosystem, difficult to say the least.\n\n47\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.990\nWe also have a known plain\ntext type of attack,\n\n48\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.310\nwhere I've got the plain text version and\nI got the Ciphertext the output, right?\n\n49\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.040\nSo I know what was fed into the machine,\nand\n\n50\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.720\nagain if I talk about the cryptosystem\nas a machine or a box.\n\n51\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.710\nI know the plain text that went in,\nI see what's come out.\n\n52\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.370\nSo I have the Ciphertext and from that,\n\n53\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.900\nI can start trying to work out what was\ndone to the, cuz I can see what it was.\n\n54\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.660\nI can see what it is now, so maybe I\ncan figure out how it was modified,\n\n55\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.500\nwhat was done in there to change it from\nthe plain text to the Ciphertext and\n\n56\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.510\nthen, if I can get that basically,\nI'm again determining the keys.\n\n57\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.540\nBecause, remember, I know the algorithm.\n\n58\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.240\nThe algorithm is typically not secret.\n\n59\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.410\nIn fact,\nwhen you talk about encryption algorithms,\n\n60\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.730\na good secure algorithm, it doesn't matter\nif everybody knows the algorithm, right?\n\n61\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.620\nI know that's an odd thing that I\ncan't remember the gentleman's name,\n\n62\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.210\nthere's actually some interesting theories\non this, but a good secure cryptosystem,\n\n63\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.810\nit shouldn't matter if everybody\nknows what the algorithm is, right?\n\n64\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.740\nIts the keying information and what makes\nit unique, we've talked about that and\n\n65\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.850\nunderstanding how that is applied in\nthose formulas that makes it secure.\n\n66\n00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.080\nSo having the plain text,\n\n67\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.110\nhaving the Ciphertext might be able\nto determine what that key was.\n\n68\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.530\nChosen plain text similar to known,\nknown plain text I know is fed in but\n\n69\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.620\nI didn't have any control\nover what was fed in, right?\n\n70\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.650\nThis might be where I intercept a copy\nof the message before it was encrypted.\n\n71\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.810\nAnd then I can intercept a copy of\nthe message after it was encrypted.\n\n72\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.780\nSo I know what the plaintext was and\nI know what the Ciphertext is.\n\n73\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.480\nChosen Plaintext means,\nI have access to the system and\n\n74\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.650\nI can feed what I want into the system,\nright?\n\n75\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.560\nSo I get to choose and that makes it\na lot easier than known plain text,\n\n76\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.970\nbecause I can start feeding in patterns.\n\n77\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.548\nA, AA, AAA, and\nI can see what that output is.\n\n78\n00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:43.630\nAnd it's gonna be a lot easier for\nme to try read.\n\n79\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.560\nNow, I say a lot easier\nrespectively to known plain text.\n\n80\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.298\nNot that it's easy in any way.\n\n81\n00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:53.793\nSo Chosen Plaintext you get to\npick what's being fed in and\n\n82\n00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.873\nyou get to see what's coming out.\n\n83\n00:04:55.873 --> 00:04:58.840\nAll right, let's see.\n\n84\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.320\nInteresting story,\nthis was in World War 2 with the Japanese,\n\n85\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.330\nthe code breakers on the American side,\n\n86\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.680\nthey had thought they figured out some of\nthe code that the Japanese were using.\n\n87\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.880\nAnd so in order to test it,\n\n88\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.570\nthey purposefully gave them some\ninformation, let it leak out,\n\n89\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.549\nwaiting to see the encrypted message\nthat the Japanese would send back.\n\n90\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.390\nAnd through that,\nbasically a Chosen Plaintext attacked,\n\n91\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.020\nthey will be able to feed\ninformation into the machine, right.\n\n92\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.110\nAnd look at the output and\ndetermine what they were using or\n\n93\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.650\nhow are they going about it.\n\n94\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.762\nSo pretty cool little story there.\n\n95\n00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:45.870\nAll right, let's see what else.\n\n96\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.570\nChosen Ciphertext same as Chosen Plaintext\nexcept now we're choosing the Ciphertext.\n\n97\n00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.830\nAgain, but that was a really tricky\none there, because you've chosen\n\n98\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.280\nthe Ciphertext and honestly I'm not\neven sure how it would get that.\n\n99\n00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.120\nBut that is one of the types of\nattacks that they can do against\n\n100\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.690\ncryptosystems as you know, or\nyou get to pick what the Ciphertext is.\n\n101\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.870\nDifferential Cryptanalysis and Linear\nCryptanalysis, these are actually the two\n\n102\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.950\nbig ones that get used most often when\nit comes to breaking cryptosystems.\n\n103\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.860\nAnd these are at least for\nmy little brain,\n\n104\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.020\nrelatively technical when they took about\nlooking at differential cryptanalysis.\n\n105\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.370\nLooking at differences in the input and\nhow it affects the output.\n\n106\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.666\nSo in this case, its kind of hassle\na little bit of chosen Plaintext in there,\n\n107\n00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:39.890\nbut it might not be that you're choosing.\n\n108\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.030\nBut your looking at different inputs\nthat are getting fed on the machine and\n\n109\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.970\nthen looking at the outputs,\nseeing what the differences are there and\n\n110\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.780\ntrying to determine the key information.\n\n111\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.510\nLinear Cryptanalysis, way beyond my\nhead but for what we need to know,\n\n112\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.370\nwe're talking about creating linear\nfunctions that represent our plaintext and\n\n113\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.030\nlinear functions that\nrepresent our Ciphertext.\n\n114\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.920\nAnd then comparing the differences\nbetween those two functions.\n\n115\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.340\nAnd then figuring out,\n\n116\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.690\nwhat is happening to the text as\nit gets fed through that machine.\n\n117\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.940\nSide channel is really trying\nto break the encryption\n\n118\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.867\nby breaking the cryptosystem itself.\n\n119\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.790\nThis might be,\nwould be a good example of side channel.\n\n120\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.220\nLooking at DMI radiation patterns\nthat are coming off the machine.\n\n121\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.720\nI'm telling you some of these attacks,\nyou start looking at them Wes,\n\n122\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.900\nand I don't know how they can\npossibly break the cryptography or\n\n123\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.480\nthe encryption using these methods.\n\n124\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Basic example and I don't even know if\nthis falls under it, the old WEP attacks\n\n125\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.760\nthat we would use, you're not actually\nattacking like the RC stream cipher but\n\n126\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.570\neverything surrounding it has issues.\n\n127\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.920\nAnd if you attack those things that are\nsurrounding, the cryptographic subsystem,\n\n128\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.180\nyou can kind of get your way in there.\n\n129\n00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.580\nUltimately, you're not really\nbreaking the cypherstream.\n\n130\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.440\nYou're just taking advantage\nof the weaknesses around it.\n\n131\n00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n132\n00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.690\nI mean, they talk about with side\nchannels, like power attacks.\n\n133\n00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.890\nSo you're looking at the power\nconsumption of the machine that's doing\n\n134\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.310\nthe encryption.\n\n135\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.400\n&gt;&gt; And somehow from that, you're going\nto be able to break that encryption.\n\n136\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.510\nAgain, I don't make this stuff up.\n\n137\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.350\nThis is actually what they do.\n\n138\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.270\nThey look in at the EMI radiation.\n\n139\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.060\nNow, we know with EMI, we've talked about\nthat, not in this particular series, but\n\n140\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.375\nin other series in our librarie.\n\n141\n00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:29.440\nThe computers emit electromagnetic\ninterference, and then we can pick that\n\n142\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.370\nup and we can basically read the text off\nyour screen but they can do that to this.\n\n143\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.050\nSo one way they might try to\nbreak an encryption system.\n\n144\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.230\nAgain, you could maybe see what that\nplaintext t was, or like I said,\n\n145\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.200\nactually looking at the power consumption.\n\n146\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.910\nAnother one is looking at\nthe processing power that's\n\n147\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.310\nbeing used to do the encryption,\nand somehow from that.\n\n148\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.450\nIt's not that they're gonna break\nthe cryptosystem solely on that, right?\n\n149\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.400\nThey're not gonna look at how much power\nthat computer's using and go, yeah,\n\n150\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.000\nwell that means that this is how\nwe break the cryptosystem, but\n\n151\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.450\nthat's one more piece of information.\n\n152\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.300\nBut I can start piling up to\nhelp break that cryptosystem.\n\n153\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.780\n&gt;&gt; Maybe an example of\nthat you've given us,\n\n154\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.600\na pretty good example of a stream\ncipher and a block cipher.\n\n155\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.770\nI might know if theres a lot of CPU or\ncomputational power on it.\n\n156\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.720\nMaybe were not using that stream cipher\nmaybe were using something that got\n\n157\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.930\nto encrypt those chunks at a time.\n\n158\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.250\nSo its sitting there,\ntaxing the processor,\n\n159\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.620\nits kind of like finger printing.\n\n160\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.570\nYou're kind of gathering that\ninformation before he end, right.\n\n161\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely that's a great example.\n\n162\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.300\nAnother one would be a replay attack.\n\n163\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.420\nAnd this doesn't really break the\ncryptosystem as much as it allows me to\n\n164\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.860\nreuse the information like,\nI don't know great captioning a hash for\n\n165\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.210\na password, and\nthen trying to replay that later on.\n\n166\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.850\nOr an authentication to a less\nsecure website I can capture\n\n167\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.170\nyour authentication information, it's\nencrypted, but I don't need to decrypt it.\n\n168\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.750\nI'll just send it again later\ntrying to authenticate as you.\n\n169\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.150\n&gt;&gt; How about maybe\na little session cookie?\n\n170\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.190\nThat's got a little bit too\nmuch information in there.\n\n171\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.510\nSomebody performs one of those man\nin the middle attacks, gets that,\n\n172\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.940\nand maybe they're not using a timestamping\ntechnology or that one-time password.\n\n173\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.100\nIt's good for as long as I need it,\nI can turn around and\n\n174\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.100\nreplay it back to the server.\n\n175\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.212\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly right.\n\n176\n00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:15.540\nAll right, algebraic looking at\nthe algorithms themselves for\n\n177\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.270\nvulnerabilities, so I know what algorithm\nis used within that cryptosystem.\n\n178\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.249\nAnd maybe I can try to find\na vulnerability in there,\n\n179\n00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:27.856\nsomething that repeats or something that\nI can feed into that breaks the system,\n\n180\n00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:30.517\nit has an output with\nimportant information.\n\n181\n00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:35.260\nMainly again, the math part of\nthe algorithm There's analytic.\n\n182\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.360\nYou can look at the structure\nof the algorithm.\n\n183\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.300\nAnd again, how it's implemented and\nWes was talking about this and\n\n184\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.120\nlet me talk about the other day.\n\n185\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.059\nWe look at WEP and we know that\nthe WEP is less than ideal, right?\n\n186\n00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:48.110\nIt shouldn't be use anymore.\n\n187\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.610\nUnless that's the only that we have,\n\n188\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.060\nbecause of the fact that\nit's vulnerable to attacks.\n\n189\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.120\nAnd in fact, with a few tools that\nanybody can get off the internet,\n\n190\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.010\nanybody can break WEP\nin a matter of minutes.\n\n191\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.510\nBut it really, when it comes down to it\nand you look at the system, it wasn't so\n\n192\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.850\nmuch that the RC4 which is the algorithm\nin there had vulnerabilities.\n\n193\n00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.260\nIt was the implementation,\nthe way they choose to implement RC4\n\n194\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.275\nwithin the WEP protocol that actually\ncaused the big vulnerabilities in there.\n\n195\n00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:26.155\nBut that's just an example of how I\ncan use analytics, analyze how it's\n\n196\n00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:30.645\nbeing used and implemented because\neven a secure encryption algorithm.\n\n197\n00:11:30.645 --> 00:11:33.950\nIf implemented improperly,\nits not gonna be secure or\n\n198\n00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.590\nis going to be vulnerable to\nsome type of cryptanalysis.\n\n199\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.790\n&gt;&gt; This is one of the reasons you've\nbeen stressing a lot throughout\n\n200\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.280\nthis series is patterns.\n\n201\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.890\nPatterns are your enemy.\n\n202\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.810\nBecause analytics, statistical\nanalysis picks these patterns up.\n\n203\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.270\nI watch it for long enough,\nI can start putting two and two together.\n\n204\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.960\nNo pun intended.\n\n205\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNo, that's absolutely right, right?\n\n206\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.360\nWe started looking at sequence numbers for\nexample.\n\n207\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.570\nAnd I realized, if I subtract the last\nsequence number from this sequence number,\n\n208\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.200\nI got so much space.\n\n209\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.600\nAnd I do the same for the next one,\nand see exact amount of jump.\n\n210\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.520\nAnd so all of a sudden I\nstart to see the pattern.\n\n211\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.440\nThere's no randomness to what\nthe next sequence number is gonna be,\n\n212\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.150\nI can predict.\n\n213\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.520\nSo that would be a form of\nanalytic analysis, right.\n\n214\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.190\nIs that we don't know, analytic analysis?\n\n215\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:20.960\nAll right.\n\n216\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.660\nLets see, Social Engineering.\n\n217\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.200\nThis is my favorite, by far the easiest,\nit doesn't involve any math.\n\n218\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.960\nI can do this one, but\nits giving somebody or\n\n219\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.820\ntrying to convince somebody to give\nup information that they shouldn't.\n\n220\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.572\nGet access to their keys, get a password,\nthat kind of a thing social engineering,\n\n221\n00:12:38.572 --> 00:12:40.770\nsame thing.\n\n222\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.400\nAnd really with crypt analysis,\n\n223\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.482\nif we're gonna take it that way,\nif I can get Wes' password,\n\n224\n00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:49.920\nyou might think well what does that\nhave to do with breaking the encryption?\n\n225\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.780\nOnce I get Wes' password I can log in,\nand then what do I have access to Wes'\n\n226\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.500\nprivate key and then, I can start\ndecrypting all of Wes' information, right?\n\n227\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.430\nSo a way around, we're not really\nbreaking the system itself, but we\n\n228\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.940\nare Breaking the encryption, I just stole\nthe key and hid to do the de-encryption.\n\n229\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.740\nNow I'm an authorized user, I should have\naccess to that confidential information.\n\n230\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.550\nSo social engineering is obviously\na tough on defend against but\n\n231\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.050\nit's the one that is used.\n\n232\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.800\nAnd then meet in the middle, just\nattack from both sides, plaintext side,\n\n233\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.050\nciphertext side, attacking from both,\n\n234\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.760\ndon't know which one's going\nto be more successful.\n\n235\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.440\nSo we'll just start from either end and\nhopefully meet in the middle, and\n\n236\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.850\nend up with a pile of keys.\n\n237\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.145\nMaybe not a pile of keys, but anything,\nyou know what I'm saying, yeah.\n\n238\n00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:37.799\nSo, in the end a lot of different types\nof attacks that can be done against\n\n239\n00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.730\ncryptosystems and\nthis is not a finite list.\n\n240\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.470\nThere's definitely others that we\ncould put on here if we chose to but\n\n241\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:50.190\nthe big ones I think for us and for\nthis exam are gonna be these two.\n\n242\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.090\nJust to understanding\ndifferential cryptanalysis and\n\n243\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:58.380\nlinear cryptanalysis are part of the two\nbiggest ones that are used, when cracking\n\n244\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.385\nencryption algorithms and\nthen understanding these terms here.\n\n245\n00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:09.070\nCiphertext Only, Known Plaintext,\nChosen Plaintext and Chosen Ciphertext.\n\n246\n00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.640\nMaking sure we're familiar\nwith what those mean.\n\n247\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.760\nSo if asked in some context in the exam,\nwe could pick the appropriate one.\n\n248\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.070\nIf they said something like\n[COUGH] the bad actor repeatedly\n\n249\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.295\nfeeds different bits of information\ninto the cryptosystem and\n\n250\n00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:30.540\nhe's looking at the output to try to break\nthe system, what method would he be using?\n\n251\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.150\nWell, he's doing\na Chosen Plaintext because he's\n\n252\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.700\nthe one that's picking what's\ngoing in the machine, right?\n\n253\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.890\nSo, understanding what those terms\nmean I think is the biggest thing.\n\n254\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.930\nAnd that's really, again I'm not expecting\nyou, and I couldn't be the one to\n\n255\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.440\nteach you how to actually go in and\ndo a linear type attack,\n\n256\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.170\nor a linear cryptanalysis\non a cryptosystem.\n\n257\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Well that's still a lot\nof information guys.\n\n258\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.790\nKeep in mind, we are in a part three.\n\n259\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.780\nAnd if maybe you're just joining us now,\ngo back and\n\n260\n00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.000\nwatch first two parts so\nthat you can come back and you can finish\n\n261\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.310\nthe basics of public key infrastructure\nand stenography in its completeness.\n\n262\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.850\nNow Mike, I know that we are running\nto the end of this episode but\n\n263\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.250\ndo you got any additional words of wisdom\nyou'd like to impart to our viewers when\n\n264\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.610\nit comes to these topics?\n\n265\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.300\n&gt;&gt; I can't think so.\n\n266\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.730\nAgain, study up on your terms,\n\n267\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.250\nplay around with some of\nthe encryption options on your system.\n\n268\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.840\nGo out and download some of those steno\ntools, and try some of those out.\n\n269\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.620\nRemember, this exam is really\nabout understanding when and\n\n270\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.610\nwhere to use certain tools more than\nreally implementing those tools.\n\n271\n00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, as always,\nwe appreciate you joining us here.\n\n272\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.290\nI know this has been a fun series.\n\n273\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.210\nI'm glad to be a part of it.\n\n274\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.790\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer out there watching.\n\n275\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Signing out for ITPro.TV.\n\n276\n00:15:41.010 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.730\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our GAIC security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.220\nJoining us back in the studios for\n\n8\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.650\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.880\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, thanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.452\nAnd yeah, more good old GAIC security,\nor GSEC as we like to call it for\n\n12\n00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:36.380\nshort, right,\nif you're gonna go take that exam.\n\n13\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.394\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at,\n\n14\n00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:40.840\nwe got diving into the world of Windows.\n\n15\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.380\nAnd we wanna look at\nworkgroups versus domains.\n\n16\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.260\nIt's an important concept that we really\nneed to understand and has a lot of\n\n17\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.650\nimpact on security, the way we handle\nsecurity, user access, things like that.\n\n18\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.550\nSo we need to be familiar with it and\nwe need to have a good understanding.\n\n19\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.080\nSo let's start by talking about workers,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.629\nAnd a work group is just a group\nof computers that work together.\n\n21\n00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.760\nI'm just kidding, although that\nwould be a convenient definition.\n\n22\n00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.560\nWhen we talk about a work group,\nwe're talking about a group of machines,\n\n23\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.480\nthat do, they work together, right.\n\n24\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.830\nWe want to be able to share resources.\n\n25\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.910\nSay Wes and I and\nother coworkers here in the office,\n\n26\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.700\nwe need to be able to share resources.\n\n27\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.437\nWe can create a little workgroup, and\n\n28\n00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:27.520\nwe can set it up to where we\ncan start sharing resources.\n\n29\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020\nWhat we have to remember about workgroups\nis the way security is handled.\n\n30\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.580\nSecurity in a workgroup is handled\non the individual machine.\n\n31\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.520\nIn other words,\n\n32\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.330\neach machine has it's own what we call\nsecurity account manager or SAM file.\n\n33\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.590\nAnd it keeps information about the\naccounts that are allowed to access that\n\n34\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.410\nmachine and\nresources on that machine in that file.\n\n35\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.350\nAnd it's local to that machine.\n\n36\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.210\nAnd let's use my laptop for example.\n\n37\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.450\nSo my machine has a SAM file in\ntheir security account manager.\n\n38\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.400\nIt's responsible for\nmanaging the security, for\n\n39\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.770\ncontrolling access to\nresources on this machine.\n\n40\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.560\nWes's laptop also has\na security account manager and\n\n41\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.790\nit's gonna be in charge of\nhandling access to that machine.\n\n42\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.250\nThese security account managers\ndon't talk to each other.\n\n43\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.730\nThey don't share information.\n\n44\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.840\nThey don't trust each other, okay.\n\n45\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.940\nAnd that's gonna be the big\nproblem when it comes to security\n\n46\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.105\nin a work group environment, is that\nthere is no centralized administration.\n\n47\n00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:26.950\nIt's handled individually on each machine.\n\n48\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.580\nWhy is that a problem?\n\n49\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.590\nWell, I'll tell you why.\n\n50\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.380\nBecause now, I've got an account that\nI can log on to on my machine and\n\n51\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.330\nI can access resources I can create\nnew files, do whatever I need to do.\n\n52\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.680\nIf I try to connect across the network\nover there to Wes's machine, or\n\n53\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.340\nmaybe he's made something available,\nhe's shared out a folder or\n\n54\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.610\nsomething like that,\nI use my account, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.670\nI'm sitting here on my machine.\n\n56\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.590\nI go to cross the network to get to it,\nhis machine is going to say,\n\n57\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.250\nI don't know who the heck you are.\n\n58\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.950\nYou're not in my local SAM file.\n\n59\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.290\nYou're not getting access to anything.\n\n60\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.696\nSo now, Wes has to make an account for\nme on his laptop, all right,\n\n61\n00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:05.540\nthat I can use to access\nresources on his laptop.\n\n62\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.500\nAnd then, same thing.\n\n63\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.180\nI would have to make an account for\nWes on my machine.\n\n64\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.990\nEven though he's got\nan account on his machine.\n\n65\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.540\nI've got to make one on my machine that\nWes can use when he tries to connect to\n\n66\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.650\nresources on my machine.\n\n67\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.990\nNow we could use the same username.\n\n68\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.020\nIf he has an account on his machine\nthat he logs in with named Wes and\n\n69\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.480\npassword one, two, three.\n\n70\n00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.280\nI could create an account over here on\nmy machine named Wes password one, two,\n\n71\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.340\nthree and\nit would seem to solve the problem but\n\n72\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.860\nit doesn't because there\nare still two separate accounts.\n\n73\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.380\nWhen Wes changes his\npassword on his machine,\n\n74\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.490\nit's not gonna change the password for the\naccount that I made for him on my machine.\n\n75\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.220\nSo Wes now has to maintain\ntwo different accounts,\n\n76\n00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.360\none at his machine, one on my machine,\nto gain access to resources.\n\n77\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.062\nHow many offices have two people in it?\n\n78\n00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:52.120\nProbably not too many, right?\n\n79\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.970\nSo let's imagine we have\nten people in our office.\n\n80\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.800\nNow each machine has to\nhave ten accounts on it.\n\n81\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.190\nOne for each person in that office\nto gain access to resources.\n\n82\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.290\nI mean it's ten machines,\nten accounts per machine.\n\n83\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.700\nThat's 100 user accounts\nthat I'm maintaining\n\n84\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.890\nto support an office of ten people.\n\n85\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.240\nNot really the way we want to go, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.830\nIt's just not very efficient.\n\n87\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.750\nIn a small environment, where you've\njust got a couple of people and not\n\n88\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.990\neverybody needs access to other people's\nmachines, maybe you can get by with this.\n\n89\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.460\nBut it's not gonna work in any kind\nof enterprise environment at all.\n\n90\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like the work group has\nan administrative complexity.\n\n91\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.610\nAnd it sounds also like it's\na decentralized environment, Mike.\n\n92\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.478\nAre there any other kinda limitations\nmaybe to the work group that we need\n\n93\n00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:34.054\nto consider?\n\n94\n00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:35.821\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure there are a few, but\n\n95\n00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:40.850\nnone that really pertain to what we're\ndealing with here, I don't think.\n\n96\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.780\nThe main thing that I want you to\nunderstand is that each machine\n\n97\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.970\nhas its own local security account manager\nand I can create accounts on that machine.\n\n98\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.620\nThey're stored locally, they can\naccess resources on this machine, but\n\n99\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.610\nthey can't go any further.\n\n100\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.610\nThose accounts that created on my\nmachine are only good on this machine.\n\n101\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.240\nThey won't allow me to access\nresources anywhere else, all right,\n\n102\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.790\nbecause it's local.\n\n103\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd I bring this up for\na couple of reasons.\n\n104\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.420\nWe're gonna talk about the next\nevolution or the next step.\n\n105\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.240\nWhat we do to centralize that.\n\n106\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.020\nThat is gonna be domains, or active\ndirectory, Windows active directory,\n\n107\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.622\ndomains or domain services.\n\n108\n00:05:16.622 --> 00:05:20.750\nThat's gonna be a way we can centralize\nall this and make it work a lot smoother,\n\n109\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.300\na lot more scalable.\n\n110\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.340\nAnd we'll come back, I think, to\nthe local thing because there is a gotcha\n\n111\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.520\nthat I see people run into,\nI guess is a good word for it.\n\n112\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.220\nWhen they're working\nwith domain members and\n\n113\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.790\nthere's local accounts on those machines.\n\n114\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.210\nSo we'll come back to that concept.\n\n115\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.482\nSo for now, local machines,\nthere is a security account manager.\n\n116\n00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:45.080\nIn fact,\nI can show you on this machine here.\n\n117\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.500\nNow, if I take a look at my laptop,\nI can right click.\n\n118\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.200\nOr I can actually,\nan easier way to go here.\n\n119\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.010\nI'll just open up file explorer.\n\n120\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.820\nI'll right click on this PC,\nand choose Manage, all right?\n\n121\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.440\nAnd in my computer management window,\nI can expand out local users in groups and\n\n122\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.090\nI can click on Users, and\nyou will see I have a few users in here.\n\n123\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.190\nAnd I can right click and I can creat a\nnew user and let's make one for Wes here.\n\n124\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.212\nOops, if I can spell your name properly.\n\n125\n00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:17.390\nWe'll just say user name Wes,\nI'll give you a super secret password,\n\n126\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.230\nand those are just some\nfrom my lab environment.\n\n127\n00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.100\nI typically don't have to change password,\npassword never expires, horrible\n\n128\n00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.850\noptions to do in the real world that's\nonly habit for me for my lab environments.\n\n129\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.832\nDon't do that in your world.\n\n130\n00:06:31.832 --> 00:06:36.090\nClick Create and close and\nnow Wes has an account.\n\n131\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.960\nSo if he ever needs to physically log onto\nthis machine, he can log on as Wes and\n\n132\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.500\nhe can use that account.\n\n133\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260\nIf he's gonna access my\nmachine across the network,\n\n134\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.850\nmaybe I've shared a folder out that I want\nhim to get access to and we're in the same\n\n135\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.280\nworkgroup, then he could use that\naccount to access those resources.\n\n136\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.210\n&gt;&gt; And from an administrative standpoint,\nyou just did that on this computer,\n\n137\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.760\nbut that doesn't affect any other\ncomputers that are gonna be in one of\n\n138\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.810\nthese work groups.\n\n139\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.200\nBack to your point is where it\ncan get a little bit complex and\n\n140\n00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.268\na little tedious to manage this.\n\n141\n00:07:03.268 --> 00:07:07.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, cuz now Ronnie's laptop,\nyou need to access that one as well.\n\n142\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.760\nRonnie needs you to make an account for\nWes, on his machine, also.\n\n143\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.462\nWe hire two new people.\n\n144\n00:07:12.462 --> 00:07:15.608\nI've gotta go back and make new accounts\non my machine for those two new people.\n\n145\n00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:18.190\nIn fact, everybody in the office\nis gonna have to do that.\n\n146\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.530\nPlus, we're gonna have\nto create accounts for\n\n147\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.480\neverybody in the office on those new two\nlaptops, for those two people, right?\n\n148\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.920\nThat's the problem with work groups,\n\n149\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.532\nis there's no centralized\nadministration and security model.\n\n150\n00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.110\nAll right, so but remember that name SAM,\n\n151\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.350\nSAM account manager or\nsecurity account manager or SAM file.\n\n152\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.222\nThat's where that information gets stored.\n\n153\n00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:40.810\nAll right, so if that's not gonna\nwork in a large environment or\n\n154\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.950\neven a mid small size environment,\nwhat do we do?\n\n155\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.120\nWell, we run active directory right?\n\n156\n00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.922\nWe create a domain and\nwe run active directory in that domain.\n\n157\n00:07:51.922 --> 00:07:56.662\nActive directory is where we're going\nto centralize all this information.\n\n158\n00:07:56.662 --> 00:07:59.849\nWithin active directory,\nwe can create user accounts.\n\n159\n00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:01.372\nAnd when we.\n\n160\n00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:02.740\nCreate a domain.\n\n161\n00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.898\nWe then join the machines,\nor nodes, to that domain and\n\n162\n00:08:06.898 --> 00:08:12.800\nit establishes a trust between that\nmachine and the domain controller.\n\n163\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.420\nSo let me back up,\n\n164\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.340\nI used a couple terms there I want to\nmake sure we're all on the same page.\n\n165\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.470\nSo active directory, that's\nWindows Domain Services, active directory\n\n166\n00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.990\ndomain services that we can install,\nit's a role that goes on our server.\n\n167\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.160\nThat server that we install that role\non is known as a domain controller,\n\n168\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.060\nthat's gonna be the one that's in charge.\n\n169\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.710\nThat's where the database\nis gonna be located\n\n170\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.990\nthat's gonna store the security\ninformation for my domain.\n\n171\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.670\nAll right?\n\n172\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.570\nAnd let me show you that.\n\n173\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.420\nI'm gonna flip over to\ndomain controller here.\n\n174\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.670\nAll right so this is a server 2016 box and\n\n175\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.410\nit's running active\ndirectory domain services.\n\n176\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.590\nSo this is my domain controller for\nmy little test lab.\n\n177\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.790\nAnd I'm gonna go tools and then active\ndirectory, users, and computers.\n\n178\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.750\nSo here I have accounts.\n\n179\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.460\nI have, just like I did in the SAM\naccount file or in the local users and\n\n180\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.520\ngroups, I can create new users.\n\n181\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.490\nBut the difference is they're not\nstored on each individual machine.\n\n182\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.070\nSo I've created an account for\nWes underneath employees here.\n\n183\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.410\nI've got an IT department, I think,\nand there's an account for Wes.\n\n184\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.270\nBut here's the big difference.\n\n185\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.930\nWith the domain,\nthere's one account that Wes is gonna use.\n\n186\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.930\nAll the machines that are part\nof the domain, Wes's laptop,\n\n187\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.110\nwhen I give him that laptop,\nI've joined that laptop to the domain.\n\n188\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.360\nAnd I've given him that laptop, and\nI've said hey Wes, if you go to log on,\n\n189\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.440\nhere's your user name, Wes and here's your\npassword that you're gonna use to log on.\n\n190\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.090\nWhen he goes to log on,\n\n191\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.100\nit's no longer the local that laptop\nthat's doing the authentication.\n\n192\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.060\nAll right?\nNow we're part of a domain.\n\n193\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.850\nIt's all been centralized\non that domain controller.\n\n194\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.520\nSo when he logs on, his information\nis actually being validated,\n\n195\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.470\nsent across the network and\nbeing validated by the domain controller.\n\n196\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.600\nThe domain controller is returning\ninformation to that domain member,\n\n197\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.480\nthat client that he's logging onto,\nthat laptop, for example, and saying, yes,\n\n198\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.730\nallow Wes, that is the right password or,\nno, don't allow Wes,\n\n199\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.030\nthat's a wrong password or\nthere's no account with the name of Wes,\n\n200\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.050\nwhatever the case may be\ndon't allow him to log on.\n\n201\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.450\nAnd so\nnow we got this really cool advantage,\n\n202\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.165\nright because the account is not stored on\nhis laptop, it's in the central location.\n\n203\n00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:30.290\nWes can go to any machine on my\nnetwork that is part of my domain,\n\n204\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.130\nand log on with that account.\n\n205\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.780\nAssuming there are some permissions\ninvolved, I can't have Wes\n\n206\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.410\njust logging on servers, so I'm not\ntalking about that, but in general.\n\n207\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.550\nNow Wes can got to any machine that's\npart of the domain and authenticate.\n\n208\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.480\nBecause the machine is not looking and\nit's local SAM file anymore.\n\n209\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.718\nIt's not going hey, there's no\naccount name Wes on this machine.\n\n210\n00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:53.045\nIt's talking to active directory,\nso now I've got one account for\n\n211\n00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:57.000\nWes that he can use to access\nresources across the entire domain.\n\n212\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.680\nHe can connect to a file server and\nask for permission to read that file.\n\n213\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.550\nAnd it can validate it with active\ndirectory and say yes or no and\n\n214\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.552\nlet him access that file.\n\n215\n00:11:05.552 --> 00:11:08.432\nI didn't have to make an account for\nWes on that file server.\n\n216\n00:11:08.432 --> 00:11:11.940\nIf I bring up another file server I\ndon't have to make an account on that\n\n217\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.440\none for Wes.\n\n218\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.460\nHe already has an account\non active directory.\n\n219\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.300\nSo that's big difference between\nwork groups and domains.\n\n220\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.240\nOne of the biggest differences is how\nsecurity is managed member work groups or\n\n221\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.150\nindividuals that are working together.\n\n222\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.660\nWork group.\n\n223\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.130\nThe security is handled\nindividually on each machine.\n\n224\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.700\nThere is no trust between those machines.\n\n225\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.680\nThey don't trust.\n\n226\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.970\nMy SAM account manager does not trust\nthe SAM account manager on Wes's machine.\n\n227\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.560\nThat's why I have to make his account for\nhim on mine.\n\n228\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.265\nIn active directory all the machines that\nare part of that domain trust active\n\n229\n00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:43.900\ndirectory.\n\n230\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.310\nAnd they're gonna say, hey look,\nyou said his account's good.\n\n231\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.272\nYou said his password was right\nYou said to let him log on,\n\n232\n00:11:49.272 --> 00:11:50.646\nI'm gonna let him log on.\n\n233\n00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:53.290\nSo now I've got one place to\ngo to manage my accounts.\n\n234\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.060\nEverybody needs one account,\nin general, and we're good to go.\n\n235\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.500\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of the management,\nyou had mentioned about the work group.\n\n236\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.620\nIf you had created an account,\nsay on your laptop there, and you assigned\n\n237\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.710\nme a password that, and maybe I change it,\nthat doesn't do in the work group,\n\n238\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.330\nin context here, that doesn't do\nanything to any other computer.\n\n239\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.940\nHow about management of the password\ninside of a domain environment,\n\n240\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.940\nwhere it's stored centrally like that?\n\n241\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.150\nAnd I'm making a change on one of the\nlaptops that you've given me permission\n\n242\n00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.120\nto log on to.\n\n243\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.990\nWhat happens to those other computers\nthat are within the domain as well?\n\n244\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.150\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n245\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.800\nAnd because those other computers don't\nknow anything about your account,\n\n246\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.620\nthey're just talking to active directory.\n\n247\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.280\nWhen you changed your password,\nyou connected to active directory and\n\n248\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.280\nchanged your password in\nthe active directory domain.\n\n249\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.050\nSo again, it doesn't matter.\n\n250\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.330\nIf you logged on to one machine,\nchange your password, log off.\n\n251\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.810\nWalk to a different machine, go to log on,\nit's gonna check with active directory and\n\n252\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.140\nactive directory already knows\nabout your new password.\n\n253\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.200\nSo again,\nyou have one account to manage for\n\n254\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.950\nWes, rather than having multiple accounts\nacross all the work group members.\n\n255\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.650\n&gt;&gt; So administratively it seems like it\nsaid, now we're going to a little bit less\n\n256\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.610\nadministration when it comes to\nthat password management there.\n\n257\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.310\nAnd something that I like even better\nis transparency of the end user.\n\n258\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n259\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.150\nIt's less administrative effort and\nit's a much more flexible,\n\n260\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.400\nrobust authentication system.\n\n261\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.040\nAll right, now let's talk about\nsome of the authentication methods.\n\n262\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.020\nWhen we talk about, logging in or\nwe talk about active directory.\n\n263\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.670\nReally, one of the things we've got to be\nfamiliar with is it's a good question.\n\n264\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.250\nActually, you know what?\n\n265\n00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.210\nLet me back up, one second.\n\n266\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.920\nCuz there's one more thing I wanna talk\nabout with work groups and domains.\n\n267\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.550\nAnd I said I was gonna come back to it and\nI almost forgot.\n\n268\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.590\nSo let me do that real quick.\n\n269\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:44.170\nIt's one of these gotcha's that I see with\nwork groups or domain members even, right?\n\n270\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.350\nI'm gonna flip back over to my client.\n\n271\n00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.550\nMy little lab machine here.\n\n272\n00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.997\nAnd currently, I am logged on as well,\nlet's just find out.\n\n273\n00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.160\nI know that's a little small.\n\n274\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.370\nYou know what, let me try PowerShell.\n\n275\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.950\nI might able to see,\nI think I adjusted my size already.\n\n276\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.650\nPowerShell, there we go.\n\n277\n00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.060\nI'm just gonna do a simple\nwhoami command and\n\n278\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.900\nI'll see that I am actually client01/mike.\n\n279\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.890\nSo that indicates that this\nis a local account, right?\n\n280\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.080\nName of the computer back slash,\nname of my account, client01Mike.\n\n281\n00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.960\nSo that means I can't access\nresources on any other machine.\n\n282\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.040\nBut this is a domain member, all right?\n\n283\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.440\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlog off of this machine.\n\n284\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:40.600\nAnd I'm going to sign back on with a\ndomain account instead of a local account.\n\n285\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.250\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.620\nSo I'll sign out,\nI'll force this guy to sign out anyway.\n\n287\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.390\nIt's gonna disconnect.\n\n288\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.840\nI'm gonna reconnect to it.\n\n289\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.660\nWe'll flip back over here and\nreconnect to my little VM.\n\n290\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.060\nI'm gonna do, other user.\n\n291\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.165\nAnd I'm gonna type in Mike and password.\n\n292\n00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:03.328\nLog in.\n\n293\n00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:08.140\nAnd wait, didn't you just log\nin with the same account?\n\n294\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.409\nLet me check, PowerShell.\n\n295\n00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:15.360\nAll right, let's adjust the font\non this PowerShell window.\n\n296\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.000\nIt's already a good hint that I'm\nlogged on with a different account\n\n297\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.270\nbecause my PowerShell\nsettings are not the same.\n\n298\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.908\nAll right, we'll switch that up.\n\n299\n00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.750\nYou can modify it,\ndon't lie to me, Windows.\n\n300\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.760\nAnd I'll do a who am I?\n\n301\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.120\nYou'll see now I am Lab Mike, all right.\n\n302\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.510\nLab is the name of my domain in\nmy little test environment here.\n\n303\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.820\nSo here's what I was trying to get at.\n\n304\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.350\nI have two accounts.\n\n305\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.930\nI have my local account, named Mike.\n\n306\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.670\nBut I also have a domain based account\nthat's stored in active directory\n\n307\n00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.860\nnamed Mike.\n\n308\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.520\nAnd that's where my end\nusers can get confused.\n\n309\n00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.527\nIt's also where I need\nto be familiar with it.\n\n310\n00:15:53.527 --> 00:15:56.194\nBecause when I'm troubleshooting access,\n\n311\n00:15:56.194 --> 00:15:59.921\nI need to understand that when\nyou join a machine to the domain.\n\n312\n00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:05.040\nAnd start using domain accounts, and\nyou're part of a domain environment.\n\n313\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.310\nThat doesn't mean the local\nsecurity account manager goes away.\n\n314\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.660\nThose local accounts are still there,\nright?\n\n315\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.349\nThe SAM file is still on my laptop,\n\n316\n00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.100\neven though my laptop is\nnow part of the domain.\n\n317\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.770\nSo I can log on with a domain account,\n\n318\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.340\nwhich would give me access to\nresources across the domain.\n\n319\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.020\nBut I can also still log\non with a local account,\n\n320\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.300\nwhich won't give me access to\nresources across the domain.\n\n321\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.190\nI'll only have access to local resources.\n\n322\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.880\nAnd you end up seeing this in\nan environment where a user says,\n\n323\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.980\nI can't access those\nresources on the network.\n\n324\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.868\nWhat is wrong?\n\n325\n00:16:36.868 --> 00:16:38.170\nAnd you troubleshoot permissions.\n\n326\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.460\nYou're like hey,\nI see your account in Active Directory.\n\n327\n00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.700\nYou're part of that sales group.\n\n328\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.290\nSales has read write.\n\n329\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.740\nThere's no reason you shouldn't\nhave read write permission.\n\n330\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.920\nYet, they're sitting there, and\n\n331\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.590\nthey can't even connect to that folder\nto see if they can access these files.\n\n332\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.690\nBecause what they don't know is they've\nlogged on with a local account,\n\n333\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.990\nnot a domain account.\n\n334\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.459\nSo you really have to\npay attention to that.\n\n335\n00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:01.768\nIt really depends on how\nyou wanna handle it.\n\n336\n00:17:01.768 --> 00:17:05.630\nYou just gotta make sure you understand\nthe difference and the fact that I can,\n\n337\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.250\neven though the machine\nis part of the domain,\n\n338\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.320\nI can still log on with a local account.\n\n339\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.460\nIt's gonna change what level\nof access I have, right?\n\n340\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.920\nBecause that local account is not\ngonna get access to resources\n\n341\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.110\nbeyond that local machine.\n\n342\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.900\nSo you really gotta pay attention to\nwhether or not you're logging on, or\n\n343\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.230\nyour users are logging on, when you're\ntroubleshooting with a local account or\n\n344\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.030\na domain account, all right?\n\n345\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.320\nI see a lot of companies, one, they don't\nmake local accounts for their users.\n\n346\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.101\nBut on laptops, a lot of times, they'll\ntake that machine with them, and I'll make\n\n347\n00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:40.427\nthem a local account that they can use\nwhen they're away from the network.\n\n348\n00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:45.411\nSo that they can log on and check email\nvia their OWA or surf the Internet or\n\n349\n00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:47.730\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n350\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.990\nSo we will make them a local account,\nand then that's when we start seeing\n\n351\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.730\nthe confusion, when they come back in,\nthey forget to switch it back to domain.\n\n352\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.960\nI will show you,\nlet me show you the log on screen here.\n\n353\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.540\nLet me go ahead and\nlog off and show you that.\n\n354\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.077\nSo I can show you how you can log on\nwith domain versus local accounts.\n\n355\n00:18:07.077 --> 00:18:09.130\nSo let me reconnect to that guy.\n\n356\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.910\nAnd when I go to log in, when I look at\nthis, it really doesn't show me anything.\n\n357\n00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.800\nIt says Mike Roderick and\nthen my password.\n\n358\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.280\nIs that my local account?\n\n359\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.725\nIs that a domain account?\n\n360\n00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.507\nWell, it's actually\nthe last account I used.\n\n361\n00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:25.006\nI might have forgotten whether I\nlogged on with a local account or\n\n362\n00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:26.220\ndomain account the last time.\n\n363\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.960\nSo, let me switch to other user.\n\n364\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.480\nAnd when I get here, notice what it\nsays right below my login dialogue.\n\n365\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.070\nSign in to lab.\n\n366\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.330\nLab, again, is the name of my domain.\n\n367\n00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.150\nSo it's gonna default to the domain.\n\n368\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:43.560\nSo when I type in Mike and my password,\nit's gonna be my domain account.\n\n369\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.920\nWhat if I wanna log in\nwith my local account?\n\n370\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.980\nWell, I need to change this.\n\n371\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.109\nSo I can do the name of my machine,\nclient01/.\n\n372\n00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:55.420\nNotice how that changed\nto sign in to client01?\n\n373\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.100\nNow I'm gonna be logging in with\nmy local account that only has\n\n374\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.290\naccess to local resources.\n\n375\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.140\nSo you can switch back and forth.\n\n376\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.013\nDomain members will default to, assuming\nyou're logging on with a domain account,\n\n377\n00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:11.719\nbut you can still log on\nwith the local account,\n\n378\n00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:15.321\nputting that name of the little\nmachine out there in the front.\n\n379\n00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.643\nAnd with Windows,\nthese clients, a lot of times,\n\n380\n00:19:17.643 --> 00:19:21.153\nthey'll remember the last account that\nwas logged on, and if that was a local\n\n381\n00:19:21.153 --> 00:19:24.999\naccount, they come into work, they log on\nand they can't get access to resources.\n\n382\n00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.454\nVery well could be because they've\nlogged on with a local account and\n\n383\n00:19:27.454 --> 00:19:28.650\nnot their domain based account.\n\n384\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.160\nAll right, enough of that.\n\n385\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.790\nI think we got a good understanding there\nthen of the difference between work group\n\n386\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.880\nand domain and how accounts are handled,\nwhere they're stored.\n\n387\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.560\nLet's talk about\nthe authentication a little bit.\n\n388\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:47.300\nAuthentication Is proving your identity,\nright?\n\n389\n00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.660\nIt's verifying who you are.\n\n390\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.574\nWhen you type in a username and\na password, and\n\n391\n00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:54.684\nthat information is validated.\n\n392\n00:19:54.684 --> 00:19:57.974\nWhether it's a local account using\nthe Security Account Manager or\n\n393\n00:19:57.974 --> 00:20:01.322\nwhether it's an Active Directory\naccount using Active Directory,\n\n394\n00:20:01.322 --> 00:20:04.900\nit's verifying that, one,\nthere is an account with that name.\n\n395\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.750\nAnd two, that the password you typed\nin matches the password that's stored\n\n396\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.120\nwith that account, and\nnow you've been authenticated, right?\n\n397\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.220\nWe now know who you are.\n\n398\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.640\nOf course,\nkeep in mind if we wanna get technical,\n\n399\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.470\nit could be Wes if he knows my password,\nright?\n\n400\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:24.140\nOne of the things in security that\nsometimes we forget or what we need to\n\n401\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.030\nstress to our end users, I guess, we know\nwe're not supposed to share our passwords.\n\n402\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.770\nUsers do it all the time.\n\n403\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.960\nHey, let me get your password,\nI need to get access to such and such,\n\n404\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.890\nor blah blah blah.\n\n405\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.930\nHey, can you log into my machine\nreal quick and grab this?\n\n406\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.550\nI gotta run to this meeting, and\nblah blah blah, here's my password.\n\n407\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.480\nAnd what they don't realize is,\n\n408\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.110\n\u007fonce somebody else has their password,\nthey can log in as them.\n\n409\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.804\nAnd there's no way for the system\nto know that it's not you, right?\n\n410\n00:20:49.804 --> 00:20:52.306\nIn other words,\nif I give my password to Wes, and\n\n411\n00:20:52.306 --> 00:20:56.472\nhe logs in as Mike with my password, how\ndoes the computer know that it's not me?\n\n412\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.630\nIt doesn't.\n\n413\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.511\nIt gives Wes now, at this point,\n\n414\n00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:05.099\nhas all the informations I would normally\nhave cuz to the system, he is now Mike.\n\n415\n00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:07.550\nAnd he can access everything\nthat I would normally access.\n\n416\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:13.930\nAnd anything he does is gonna be\nlogged as who's doing it, me, yeah.\n\n417\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.458\nSo when he goes and does something silly,\nthat log entry's gonna say Mike Roderick\n\n418\n00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:22.739\nat 10:42 AM deleted the blah blah blah\nblah, or whatever the case may be.\n\n419\n00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:26.171\nAnd I'll have to somehow prove that I\nwasn't in the building or something like\n\n420\n00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:29.880\nthat because it's gonna look, for\nall intents and purposes, like I did it.\n\n421\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.592\n&gt;&gt; Now I have to say, well,\ngame on after the show ends for sure.\n\n422\n00:21:32.592 --> 00:21:34.844\nSo Mike, yeah, at a basic level,\n\n423\n00:21:34.844 --> 00:21:39.210\nauthentication is really just\nvalidating the credentials.\n\n424\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.336\nAnd it's up to the company\nto put things in place,\n\n425\n00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:44.631\nto make sure that we can identify that\nthe person that holds those credentials\n\n426\n00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:46.065\ntruly is the person that should.\n\n427\n00:21:46.065 --> 00:21:48.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nit comes to end user education,\n\n428\n00:21:48.952 --> 00:21:51.080\nteaching them not to share passwords.\n\n429\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.230\nThere are other authentication\nmethods we're gonna talk about\n\n430\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.438\nhere in just a second.\n\n431\n00:21:55.438 --> 00:22:00.190\nI also wanna make note here, we're gonna\ntalk about access control in a little bit.\n\n432\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.128\nAnd that is gonna be authorization.\n\n433\n00:22:04.128 --> 00:22:05.400\nNow I wanna make sure at this point,\n\n434\n00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.580\nwe understand the difference\nbetween those two terms.\n\n435\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.280\nBecause some people will try\nto use them interchangeably,\n\n436\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.980\nand they're most definitely not.\n\n437\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.240\nAuthentication and authorization\nare two separate steps, right?\n\n438\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.590\nAuthentication is proving who you are.\n\n439\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.970\nAuthorization is determining,\nbased on who you are, whether or\n\n440\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.340\nnot you should or should not have\naccess or have the right to do this or\n\n441\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.356\ndon't have the right to do this.\n\n442\n00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:33.850\nI cannot authorize you until you've\nbeen successfully authenticated.\n\n443\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:38.850\nIf I don't know who you are, how can I\ntell you what you can and can't do, right?\n\n444\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.632\nSo keep that in mind as we progress\nthrough this, authentication and\n\n445\n00:22:42.632 --> 00:22:45.640\nauthorization, two completely\nseparate concepts.\n\n446\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.310\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you've mentioned that term,\nauthentication.\n\n447\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.760\nI can only assume here, and\nwe know we shouldn't always assume,\n\n448\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.800\nthat in a work group and a domain, the\nmechanisms that we use to authenticate,\n\n449\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.870\nmost likely are gonna be different here.\n\n450\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.420\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n451\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.167\nWhen we look at Active Directory and\nauthentication, and that's really what we\n\n452\n00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:09.598\nwanna focus on here, Windows environment\nis gonna be Active Directory.\n\n453\n00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:14.061\nThere's a couple of different\nauthentication protocols that\n\n454\n00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:19.034\nhave been used way back in the day\nbefore NT4, so NT351 and prior.\n\n455\n00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:22.230\nSome of you might be going, wait,\nwhat the heck is he talking about, NT?\n\n456\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.200\nWhat does that mean?\n\n457\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.770\nWindows New Technology, it was\n[LAUGH] prior to Windows Server 2000,\n\n458\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.957\nwe had Windows NT.\n\n459\n00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:31.813\nAnd way back then in 351 and prior,\n\n460\n00:23:31.813 --> 00:23:35.480\nwe used something called NTLM or\nNT LAN Manager.\n\n461\n00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.156\nBefore that, there was actually\nsomething called LAN Manager.\n\n462\n00:23:38.156 --> 00:23:43.178\nStarted with NT 4.0,\nthat came out with NTLM version 2 or\n\n463\n00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:46.230\nv2, which is a much more secure, or\n\n464\n00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:51.558\nI will say a more secure method\nthan NTLM 1 or the original NTLM.\n\n465\n00:23:51.558 --> 00:23:56.643\nAnd that's what we used for a long\ntime until Gosh, I guess it was 2000,\n\n466\n00:23:56.643 --> 00:24:02.790\nServer 2000 is when they came out with a\nnew authentication method called Kerberos.\n\n467\n00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.510\nNow, Kerberos is not a Microsoft thing.\n\n468\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.690\nIt's developed by some brainiacs out at\nMIT and it's actually an open standard.\n\n469\n00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.386\nAnd it's a little different\nfrom the way NTLM and\n\n470\n00:24:15.386 --> 00:24:20.719\nI'm gonna refer to NTLMv2 as NTLM,\nwhich is a little shorter to say.\n\n471\n00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:24.944\nJust assume that I'm always talking\nabout the most current version, so\n\n472\n00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:25.991\nNTLM version 2.\n\n473\n00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:33.980\nNTLMv2, or NTLM, was a challenge-response\nauthentication method.\n\n474\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.800\nSimilar to CHAP, if anybody out there,\nif you guys are familiar with\n\n475\n00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.720\nthe Challenge-Handshake Authentication\nProtocol, it's really what NTLM was about.\n\n476\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.639\nIt was a series of challenges\nthat were sent, and\n\n477\n00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:50.183\nthen responses that were received\nthat would help us authenticate,\n\n478\n00:24:50.183 --> 00:24:53.927\nright, that would allow\nus to authenticate.\n\n479\n00:24:53.927 --> 00:24:56.435\nThe problem with NTLMv2 or\nsome of the downsides or\n\n480\n00:24:56.435 --> 00:24:59.280\nweaknesses of it was it\nwas a little bit slower.\n\n481\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.810\nIt used what was called pass\nthrough authentication.\n\n482\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.040\nWhen I wanted to go access\na resource on a server, well,\n\n483\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.560\nmy request would go into that server,\nthe server would then have to talk\n\n484\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.380\nto the domain controllers and\nit would end up coming back around.\n\n485\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.710\nAnd it would take a little bit longer for\n\n486\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.760\nme to actually authenticate\nto get to that resource.\n\n487\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.300\nThere was no mutual authentication, that\nmeant that when you connected with NTLM,\n\n488\n00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.240\nyou were verifying the identity\nof the client, the server\n\n489\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.770\nwas verifying your identity, but there was\nno verification in the other direction.\n\n490\n00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.370\nThere was no, me the client,\n\n491\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.620\nwas not verifying the identity of the\nserver, which we know could be a problem.\n\n492\n00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.270\nWe've heard about scams where you\nget redirected to a rogue server,\n\n493\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.250\nthings like that, right?\n\n494\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.558\nThere was no authentication of the server,\nno mutual authentication.\n\n495\n00:25:43.558 --> 00:25:46.557\nAnd there was no means of delegation,\n\n496\n00:25:46.557 --> 00:25:51.350\nin other words allowing for\nmy credentials to be delegated.\n\n497\n00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.370\nLet's say I go and I visit a web server\nand that web server has to reach out and\n\n498\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.290\ntalk to a back end database to pull\ninformation to populate this web page.\n\n499\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.640\nWell, the web server with\nKerberos can delegate.\n\n500\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.539\nAnd as an example of delegation I hit that\nweb server, the web server, then, can use\n\n501\n00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:13.237\nmy credentials to talk to that database,\nright, to get that information back.\n\n502\n00:26:13.237 --> 00:26:16.160\nSo that I'm seeing things\nthat I would have access to.\n\n503\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.506\nThat's delegation,\n\n504\n00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:22.188\nallowing my credentials to be presented\nby a third party to another resource.\n\n505\n00:26:22.188 --> 00:26:26.007\nSo no delegation, no smart cards support.\n\n506\n00:26:26.007 --> 00:26:30.460\nNo, yeah, no smart card support and\nit was proprietary Microsoft.\n\n507\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.869\nIt can only be used with\nWindow Operating Systems.\n\n508\n00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:35.760\nKerberos is an open standard,\nthis is what we use today.\n\n509\n00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.201\nKerberos version 5, is the authentication\nprotocol in Active Directory, or\n\n510\n00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:43.114\nin server, gosh, again,\nI think since 2000,\n\n511\n00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:46.370\nsince Server 2000 we've\nbeen using Kerberos.\n\n512\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.214\nBut Kerberos Version 5 is\nwhat we're currently using.\n\n513\n00:26:49.214 --> 00:26:54.390\nAnd it's much better than NTLMv2,\nit's faster authentication.\n\n514\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.380\nIt's a ticket-based system\nwhere when you've authenticate,\n\n515\n00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.870\nyou get a ticket that proves that\nyou've authenticated, right?\n\n516\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.841\nThey wanna go to access a resource,\nI can present this ticket information and\n\n517\n00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:09.825\nall the servers, all the members of\nthe domain trust the domain controller.\n\n518\n00:27:09.825 --> 00:27:13.071\nThe tickets are issued by the domain\ncontroller, therefore when I go to present\n\n519\n00:27:13.071 --> 00:27:16.050\nthat ticket, they don't have\nto reverify my authentication.\n\n520\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.300\nThey can say, you've already been\nauthenticated by the domain controller,\n\n521\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.270\nI trust the domain controller did his\njob and authenticated you properly.\n\n522\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.098\nSo I'll go ahead and accept this ticket\nand allow you to access this resource.\n\n523\n00:27:27.098 --> 00:27:29.256\nSo there's a little bit\nmore complexity in there.\n\n524\n00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:32.090\nThere's a few different tickets\nthat are getting issued.\n\n525\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.360\nThere's ticket granting tickets or\nsession granting tickets.\n\n526\n00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.450\nThey're timestamped,\nthey're only good for so long.\n\n527\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.759\nSo there is a little more complexity.\n\n528\n00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:43.354\nI'm making it a little more simpler\nthan it actually is, but for\n\n529\n00:27:43.354 --> 00:27:47.782\nwhat we need to understand, is the\ndifference between NTLMv2 and Kerberos.\n\n530\n00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:52.650\nKerberos ticket-based system,\nit's a lot faster in that respect.\n\n531\n00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.300\n&gt;&gt; Very good Mike.\n\n532\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.820\nNow that's a lot of great information.\n\n533\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.470\nNow I do know that we're flexing\nthe time on the clock a little bit, but\n\n534\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.310\nyou know what Mike?\n\n535\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:03.420\nI have to say that I might go ahead and\nappease the time Gods here and\n\n536\n00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.580\nsay, maybe we should stretch this\none out just a little bit longer cuz\n\n537\n00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.673\nI know you have one more\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n538\n00:28:08.673 --> 00:28:10.780\nOr would you like to go ahead and\nsave it for a second episode?\n\n539\n00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.740\n&gt;&gt; No, let's go ahead and finish it up.\n\n540\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.970\nThere is really not that much left.\n\n541\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.578\nWe just gotta a couple of more\nthings we wanna talk about.\n\n542\n00:28:15.578 --> 00:28:18.401\nSo with Kerberos, again,\nfaster authentication,\n\n543\n00:28:18.401 --> 00:28:23.056\nchoosing that ticket-based system, there\nis mutual authentication, there can be.\n\n544\n00:28:23.056 --> 00:28:23.971\nIt's optional,\n\n545\n00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:28.734\nit's not on by default but I can announce\nthat both ends are getting authenticated.\n\n546\n00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:33.196\nSo not only is the server assured of my\nauthentication when I access the resource\n\n547\n00:28:33.196 --> 00:28:35.672\nI can be assured of the server's identity.\n\n548\n00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:39.810\nAnd then I'm accessing the proper server\nthe one that I think I'm supposed to be\n\n549\n00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.500\naccessing.\n\n550\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.385\nSo optional mutual authentication,\n\n551\n00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:47.900\ndelegation of authentication\nis possible with Kerberos.\n\n552\n00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.994\nSmart card support and smart cards, what\nwe're getting ready to talk about next,\n\n553\n00:28:52.994 --> 00:28:57.550\nit's a much more secure way to\nauthenticate than anything else.\n\n554\n00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.120\nSo with Kerberos we can store\ninformation on smart cards and\n\n555\n00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.670\nuse those to authenticate.\n\n556\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.630\nAnd it's an open standard, like I said,\n\n557\n00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.920\nit was developed at MIT, or\npeople at MIT, I should say.\n\n558\n00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.290\nAnd it's used in several different places,\nnot just Windows.\n\n559\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.260\nThey've kind of adopted it and\nthey use it.\n\n560\n00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.380\nBut again, it's an open standard\nwhich always has its benefits,\n\n561\n00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.260\nit's not closed off.\n\n562\n00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.870\nWe can see what's going on.\n\n563\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:25.030\nWe can verify what's going\non behind the scenes.\n\n564\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.770\nAnd we can use it,\n\n565\n00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:30.280\nI guess even more importantly, it can be\nused outside of the Windows environment.\n\n566\n00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.310\nWhich is a fantastic\nthing in today's world,\n\n567\n00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.410\nwe always end up with our\nmixed environments, right.\n\n568\n00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.620\nIt's not just a Microsoft shop.\n\n569\n00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.140\nEverybody's got their MacBooks and\n\n570\n00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.370\ntheir Linux Os's and\nwhatever else the case may be.\n\n571\n00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.150\nSo Kerberos let's everything\nkind of play along nicely.\n\n572\n00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.830\nAll right, last thing we wanna\ntalk about then is smart cards.\n\n573\n00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.530\nSmart cards are the up and\ncoming way to authenticate.\n\n574\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.500\nWe see it more and\n\n575\n00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.230\nmore in our different environments\nbecause it's a much more secure method.\n\n576\n00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.770\nInitially there was a little expense\ninvolved but now that it's becoming more\n\n577\n00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:06.720\npopular, you know the old, the whole,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n578\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.600\nNot supply and demand but, as the need\ngoes up, the manufacturers kick up,\n\n579\n00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.070\nthe supply goes up.the price goes down,\nmore people can buy it.\n\n580\n00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:19.350\nDrives up the desire which means,\nit's a whole cycle there, right.\n\n581\n00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.584\nGood old capitalism or\nsomething like that.\n\n582\n00:30:22.584 --> 00:30:25.870\nYes, smart cards are within\nreach of most organizations now.\n\n583\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:31.010\nIt's really, a lot of laptops that you buy\nhas smart card readers built in to them.\n\n584\n00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:35.212\nWe're seeing smart card used for not\nonly authentication but access control.\n\n585\n00:30:35.212 --> 00:30:38.100\nAnd Wes,\nI think we here we use smart cards.\n\n586\n00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.260\nYou probably got one on you.\n\n587\n00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something like this, right?\n\n588\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.060\nThis would be a smart card, right.\n\n589\n00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.475\n&gt;&gt; That one might be an RFID-\n&gt;&gt; I know an RFID,\n\n590\n00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:49.746\nbut the concept would be\nclose to the same, right?\n\n591\n00:30:49.746 --> 00:30:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, it is very similar.\n\n592\n00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.190\nWhen we talk about a smart card\nlet's do define what it is.\n\n593\n00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.089\nA smart card is a credit card sized,\ntypically plastic polymer type card,\n\n594\n00:30:59.089 --> 00:31:02.062\nif we want to get all technical and\ndefine it.\n\n595\n00:31:02.062 --> 00:31:03.661\nBut it has a chip in it.\n\n596\n00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:07.646\nAnd interesting, you go out and\nread up on smart cards and\n\n597\n00:31:07.646 --> 00:31:11.810\non Microsoft sites they call\nit a tamper-proof computer.\n\n598\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.130\nA small tamper-proof computer.\n\n599\n00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.500\nAnd you're like, wait,\na smart card is a computer?\n\n600\n00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.860\nTechnically, it is.\n\n601\n00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.445\nIn that chip, there is logic that allows\nit to communicate with controllers.\n\n602\n00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:27.795\nThere's a file system that\ncan be partitioned up.\n\n603\n00:31:27.795 --> 00:31:31.445\nAnd some of it can be secured and\nother can be accessed publicly.\n\n604\n00:31:32.685 --> 00:31:36.715\nThere's a, I say communication\nmethod that can be invoked.\n\n605\n00:31:36.715 --> 00:31:41.805\nVendors can program those chips to\ndo certain things within there.\n\n606\n00:31:41.805 --> 00:31:45.365\nAnd so it really truly is by\nstrict definitions a small,\n\n607\n00:31:45.365 --> 00:31:50.467\nMicrosoft says tamper-proof,\nI'm gonna say tamper-resistant computer.\n\n608\n00:31:50.467 --> 00:31:52.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz in security we never say never, right?\n\n609\n00:31:52.394 --> 00:31:54.915\nNow, one of the things that's\ncoming to mind, Mike, and\n\n610\n00:31:54.915 --> 00:31:57.692\nthis might kinda like the RFID card\nMight not be quite the same but\n\n611\n00:31:57.692 --> 00:32:01.138\nI'm thinking about some of newer debit and\ncredit cards out there, got a little\n\n612\n00:32:01.138 --> 00:32:04.550\nelectronic chip built right on them,\nwould this be close to the same concept?\n\n613\n00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.650\n&gt;&gt; Yep those are exactly right,\nthose are smart cards.\n\n614\n00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.970\nSo where does that fit in to\nwhat we're talking about, right?\n\n615\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:13.050\nHow do we get this back into\nsecurity in our environments?\n\n616\n00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.356\nWell, smart cards with that little\ntiny computer built into them,\n\n617\n00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:19.850\nthat little chip and non-volatile\nmemory that we can store things in.\n\n618\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.857\nWait, did you just say we\ncan store things in there?\n\n619\n00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:27.977\nYes I did, I can store your\nauthentication information on this card.\n\n620\n00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:30.518\nAnd so\nnow when you walk up to your machine,\n\n621\n00:32:30.518 --> 00:32:34.838\nrather than typing in a username and\npassword, you can swipe your card.\n\n622\n00:32:34.838 --> 00:32:37.400\nAnd now you can authenticate, right.\n\n623\n00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.430\nThey can submit your information,\nit's much more difficult for\n\n624\n00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.360\nsomebody to look over your shoulder and\nsee you typing your password.\n\n625\n00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.525\nYou don't have to write your\npassword down anywhere, you're not.\n\n626\n00:32:48.525 --> 00:32:49.208\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n\n627\n00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:52.550\nSo it's a much more secure solution.\n\n628\n00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.824\nWe can put certificates in there, which\nare extremely hard to fake and forge,\n\n629\n00:32:55.824 --> 00:32:58.512\nand we can store those in there and\nuse that for authentication.\n\n630\n00:32:58.512 --> 00:33:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably got a little brighter in here\ncuz I think I just had a lightbulb moment.\n\n631\n00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.062\nAnd it comes to mind, and I know you're a\nformer military, how about the CAC cards,\n\n632\n00:33:06.062 --> 00:33:07.420\nthe Common Access Cards?\n\n633\n00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.840\nIs that an example of a smart card?\n\n634\n00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.497\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, CAC card is definitely a smart\ncard, it's a little chip that stores\n\n635\n00:33:13.497 --> 00:33:16.290\ninformation, can read\nthat information back.\n\n636\n00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.128\nSo again, we don't need to get into the\nwhole inner workings of how smart cards\n\n637\n00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:21.730\nwork and things like that.\n\n638\n00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.210\nWhat we need to be familiar with is that\nour modern Windows operating systems fully\n\n639\n00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.430\nsupport smart card authentication.\n\n640\n00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.910\nWe can store all kinds of information in\nthere, not just, but most importantly for\n\n641\n00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.990\nthis conversation,\nis gonna be user name and password.\n\n642\n00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.700\nOr if we're using certificates for\nauthentication,\n\n643\n00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.680\nwe can store certificates\non those smart cards.\n\n644\n00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.100\nA lot of times smart cards will\nhave a PIN associated with them,\n\n645\n00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.140\nwhere you have to punch in a PIN just\nlike you do when you go to the ATM.\n\n646\n00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.860\nWhy do we do that?\n\n647\n00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.880\nThat's multi-factor authentication.\n\n648\n00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.080\nIf Wes gets my smart card, he could\nswipe it and authenticate as me, right?\n\n649\n00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.650\nHe doesn't even have to know my password,\nhe's got my card.\n\n650\n00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.410\nIf there's a PIN associated with it,\nnow he needs two things,\n\n651\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.110\nhe needs my card and my PIN.\n\n652\n00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.060\nIf he somehow sees me typing my PIN,\nhe doesn't have my card hopefully.\n\n653\n00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.030\nIf he steals my card while I\nleave it laying on my desk,\n\n654\n00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.920\nhe doesn't have my PIN hopefully, so\nagain it makes it a little more difficult.\n\n655\n00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.090\nA couple other things I want\nto mention about smart cards,\n\n656\n00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.510\nthere are two different types\nof cards that we deal with.\n\n657\n00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.218\nThere's contact and\nnon-contact, or contactless,\n\n658\n00:34:22.218 --> 00:34:24.410\ndepending on what you're reading.\n\n659\n00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.230\nContact cards have little pads,\nif you will.\n\n660\n00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:34.030\nAnd when you slide that card, or a lot of\ntimes these are cards that you have to\n\n661\n00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.130\ninsert into a reader, not so much swipe.\n\n662\n00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.270\nWhen I say swipe, that's really, usually\nreferring to as magnetic stripe cards,\n\n663\n00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.310\nand those are not smart cards,\ndon't confuse those with smart cards.\n\n664\n00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.080\nBut there are some chip readers\nthat you do slide through.\n\n665\n00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.991\nMost of them are an insert-type thing.\n\n666\n00:34:50.991 --> 00:34:55.071\nAnd as Wes pointed out, we're seeing it\nwith all the credit cards and debit cards\n\n667\n00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:59.109\nhere in the States, are now switching to\nthis system rather than the magnetic.\n\n668\n00:34:59.109 --> 00:35:04.150\nBecause it can store more information and\nit's a lot more secure solution.\n\n669\n00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.120\nBut again, back to what we're doing here.\n\n670\n00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.870\nThere's contact cards\nthat do require a reader.\n\n671\n00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.995\nNow, that reader might be an external\ndevice that you plug in via USB.\n\n672\n00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:16.675\nIt might be built into your laptop,\nwhere you slide it in a little slot.\n\n673\n00:35:17.755 --> 00:35:20.785\nWe use them for\naccess entry around the building,\n\n674\n00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:24.345\nyou might have to slide your\ncard into a little slot there.\n\n675\n00:35:24.345 --> 00:35:26.495\nSo those are the contact-based\nsmart cards.\n\n676\n00:35:26.495 --> 00:35:28.790\nBut there's also contactless smart cards.\n\n677\n00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.400\nThese guys use shortwave radio, and\nthey've got an antenna that's typically\n\n678\n00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.822\nwrapped, it's in the plastic, but\nkind of around the edge of the plastic.\n\n679\n00:35:37.822 --> 00:35:40.820\nAnd they're proximity based, right?\n\n680\n00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.470\nIt's contactless.\n\n681\n00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.500\nYou don't have to stick it in,\n\n682\n00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.190\nthere's no metal contacts being\nmade to transmit information.\n\n683\n00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.680\nBasically the readers, if you will, for\n\n684\n00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.450\nthe contactless, send out RF.\n\n685\n00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.520\nAnd when your card gets in range,\nthat radiates the antenna,\n\n686\n00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.190\nwhich activates the card.\n\n687\n00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.330\nAnd it'll kick in and\nstart transmitting data back and\n\n688\n00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.230\nforth to this reader, all right?\n\n689\n00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.470\nAnd it's actually something\nthat can be adjusted.\n\n690\n00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.398\nLike a lot of them,\n\n691\n00:36:10.398 --> 00:36:14.000\nyou have to be within down to two\ncentimeters to get it to activate.\n\n692\n00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.480\nOthers, you can set it up to a couple of\nfeet, where, just get that card close.\n\n693\n00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.050\nOr as I walk by the doorway,\n\n694\n00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:24.620\nmaybe I've got a reader sitting over\nhere in the hall on the wall by door.\n\n695\n00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.890\nAnd just me getting close,\n\n696\n00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.140\nas I'm walking towards the door,\nis enough to release the door.\n\n697\n00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.940\nIt says that's Mike, he's allowed\nthrough this door between 8 and 5,\n\n698\n00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.160\nand we'll go ahead and open them, right.\n\n699\n00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.118\nSo smart cards.\n\n700\n00:36:35.118 --> 00:36:38.600\nLittle chip, store information.\n\n701\n00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.730\nThey got memory, they've got processor.\n\n702\n00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.945\nThey can be contact-based,\nwhere I need a reader to plug in.\n\n703\n00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:48.875\nThat reader can be hooked up via USB or\nother mechanisms,\n\n704\n00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:50.740\nlike built in to the machine itself.\n\n705\n00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.260\nAnd then you have contactless,\n\n706\n00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.100\nwhich you use as a shortwave radio,\nfor the communications.\n\n707\n00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great\nwealth of information, Mike.\n\n708\n00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.140\nWe definitely appreciate you\nstopping by and letting us know.\n\n709\n00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.405\nBut we have definitely pushed the clock,\nto its wit's end on this one.\n\n710\n00:37:05.405 --> 00:37:06.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to go ahead and\n\n711\n00:37:06.470 -->

00:00:08.311\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:09.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.203\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n7\n00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:20.421\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our fundamental course.\n\n8\n00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:22.136\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:24.690\nthis very endeavor is none\nother than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.589\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, glad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.090\nAnd we are moving on into the world of\nWindows permissions in this particular\n\n13\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.650\nepisode.\n\n14\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.892\nSo we're gonna take a look at a few\nthings I wanna look at ntfs permissions,\n\n15\n00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:36.850\nwe wanna look at share permissions.\n\n16\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.162\nWe also wanna take a look at\nactive directory permissions,\n\n17\n00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.820\nregistry permissions and\nprint permissions.\n\n18\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.486\nWell have a lot of permissions to go over.\n\n19\n00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:49.100\nAnd let's start with the basics we're\ngonna talk about ntfs permissions first.\n\n20\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.330\nNTFS permissions are part of\nthe NTFS file system, all right.\n\n21\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.340\nSo when we format a volume as NTFS,\none of the things that we get,\n\n22\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.680\none of the advantages of using NTFS over,\nsay, FAT32 or\n\n23\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.800\nsome other file system, is the file and\nfolder level security that we get.\n\n24\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.680\nThat's the NTFS permissions that\nwe can assign over a resource.\n\n25\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.290\nWhen you format a volume with NTFS,\nevery object on that volume\n\n26\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.180\ngets what we call an access\ncontrol list associated with it.\n\n27\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.250\nThat access control list is where I list\nthe people that I want to give access,\n\n28\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.890\nthat's how I control access to the object,\nright.\n\n29\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.770\nHence the name access control list.\n\n30\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.181\nNow there are different access\nmodels that we can use.\n\n31\n00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:44.295\nSo let's just real quick define NTFS\nas a Discretionary Access Control List\n\n32\n00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:49.656\nsystem or, what we call it DACL,\nDiscretionary Access Control.\n\n33\n00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:52.940\nAnd then the list is\nthe actual list permissions.\n\n34\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.730\nVersus, say, Mandatory Access Control.\n\n35\n00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.206\nLet's contrast it with something else,\n\n36\n00:01:56.206 --> 00:02:00.370\nso we understand what Mike's trying to\nsay here, Mandatory Access Control.\n\n37\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.980\nSomebody is going to define who\nshould have access to this resource.\n\n38\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.770\nAnd, let's say,\nI create an object, a file.\n\n39\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.580\nSomebody else would be responsible for\nsaying,\n\n40\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.900\nhey that file is considered classified.\n\n41\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.540\nAnd if a person trying to access it\ndoesn't have the appropriate level\n\n42\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.360\nthey're not gonna get access to it.\n\n43\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.441\nWhereas, the discretionary is typically\nat the discretion of the creator of\n\n44\n00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:27.142\nthe object.\n\n45\n00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:31.852\nIn other words, when I create a file,\nI'm considered the creator\n\n46\n00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:36.070\nowner of that file and\nI can add remove people from the list.\n\n47\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.130\nI can choose who I want to allow or deny,\nor give read or write, or what have you.\n\n48\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.137\nSo, discretionary access control\nis discretionary, meaning,\n\n49\n00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:46.187\nat the discretion of\nthe owner of the object.\n\n50\n00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:50.308\nWhereas mandatory access control, there's\ntypically a separate body that decides\n\n51\n00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:52.530\nhey, we're gonna read your document.\n\n52\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.843\nYou've mentioned this and\nthis and this in here,\n\n53\n00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:56.672\nit's gonna get stamped as top secret.\n\n54\n00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:59.940\nYou, the person that created it,\nreally had no control over that.\n\n55\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.560\nI guess I did a little bit by\nincluding that information,\n\n56\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.230\nbut you get the idea all right.\n\n57\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.650\nSo just terminology wise,\n\n58\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.056\nunderstand that NDFS is based\non discretionary access control.\n\n59\n00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.213\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike, in one of\nthe other episodes in this course,\n\n60\n00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.091\nyou had mentioned a concept\nof work groups and domains.\n\n61\n00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.792\nAnd you mentioned authentication,\nthat was verifying who you are but\n\n62\n00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.933\nyou also taught us another concept too.\n\n63\n00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:24.790\nYou mentioned another\nconcept called authorization.\n\n64\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.447\nIs that where we start to see\nthe concept of authorization here?\n\n65\n00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:29.180\n&gt;&gt; It's absolutely.\n\n66\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.077\nThat's a great point.\n\n67\n00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.179\nWhen I logged on to my system,\nI authenticated it.\n\n68\n00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.540\nI verified that I am Mike Roderick by\ntyping in the appropriate password.\n\n69\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.600\nSo I've been authenticated.\n\n70\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.070\nThe system now knows who I am.\n\n71\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.950\nSo when I go to access a resource,\nit now has to authorize me.\n\n72\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.200\nShould Mike be able to double\nclick on this file or not?\n\n73\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.316\nIf he is able to double click and\nopen that file, can he just read it,\n\n74\n00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:54.790\ncan he read and write, can he delete it?\n\n75\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.770\nYou know, that's the authorization part,\ndetermining what level of access I have.\n\n76\n00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.834\nNow that it knows who I am so\nyou are absolutely right,\n\n77\n00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:06.502\nthis is where we start getting\ninto the authorization phase.\n\n78\n00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:10.730\nSo a couple things I want us to be\nfamiliar with about NTFS permission.\n\n79\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.285\nFirst of all they're always checked,\nalways.\n\n80\n00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:16.035\nRegardless and you might think\nlike duh shouldn't they be?\n\n81\n00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:17.005\nYes they should but\n\n82\n00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:19.915\nwe're gonna talk about another type of\npermissions that aren't always check.\n\n83\n00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:21.331\nSo I wanna differentiate.\n\n84\n00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:25.624\nNTFS permissions are always checked,\nwhether you are accessing a resource\n\n85\n00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:30.597\non your local machine, it's gonna verify\nyour identity or it's gonna authorize you.\n\n86\n00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:35.402\nWhether you're going across the network,\nyou're gonna need\n\n87\n00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:40.487\nthe appropriate NTFS permission\nover those resources all right?\n\n88\n00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:43.290\nNTFS permissions are also accumulative.\n\n89\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.770\nNow typically when we\nassign NTFS provisions,\n\n90\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.123\na best practice is to assign\nthem to groups and not to users.\n\n91\n00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.170\nBut we're gonna save that for another day.\n\n92\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.060\nThat's really not something I think\nwe need to worry about right here.\n\n93\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.110\nBut what I want you to understand is\nNTFS permissions are cumulative, and\n\n94\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.580\nwhat that means is you get to add up\n\n95\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.150\nall the permissions that\nhave been assigned to you.\n\n96\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.420\nSo let's say that you belong,\nwe were talking about this earlier,\n\n97\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.870\nlet's say you belong to\na group called sales.\n\n98\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870\nOne of the cool things\nabout NTFS is that I can\n\n99\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.990\nuse groups to ease\nthe assignment of permissions.\n\n100\n00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.880\nWe'll take a little side track here\njust for a second to talk about groups.\n\n101\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.175\nCuz let's say I have 30 sales people.\n\n102\n00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:27.545\nAnd I've got a resource that I want all\nmy salespeople to be able to read this\n\n103\n00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:29.075\nreport, for example.\n\n104\n00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:33.825\nWell I could add each one of those\nsalespeople to the access control list for\n\n105\n00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:34.925\nthat report.\n\n106\n00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.590\nAnd I could give them all read permission.\n\n107\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.317\nI'd have 30 of them,\nthat's be 30 people I'd have to add,\n\n108\n00:05:39.317 --> 00:05:41.780\ngiving them permissions one at a time.\n\n109\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.310\nOr what I can do is I can create\na security group in active directory.\n\n110\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.060\nAnd I can put all, and\nlets say I call it sales,\n\n111\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.270\nI can put all 30 sales\nusers in that group.\n\n112\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.030\nNow I can go to the resources,\nthe report, and\n\n113\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.580\nI can assign the permissions to the group.\n\n114\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.040\nSo one entry in my access control list,\nthat say sales group has read permissions.\n\n115\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.860\nNow, anybody in that group\nwill get that permission,\n\n116\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.570\nthat read permission over that report.\n\n117\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.240\nIf I hire ten new sales people tomorrow, I\ndon't have to go modify the permissions on\n\n118\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.920\nthat report, I just need to make\nsure I put them in that group,\n\n119\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.960\nbecause the group already\nhas the permissions.\n\n120\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.940\nIf five of those people\nleave the company tomorrow\n\n121\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.140\nI don't have to go modify\nthe access control list.\n\n122\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.214\nI just pull them out of that group,\nthey no longer have those permissions.\n\n123\n00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:26.704\nOr, maybe they changed departments,\n\n124\n00:06:26.704 --> 00:06:29.370\nand they shouldn't be able\nto read that report anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.310\nI just pull them out of the group,\nthey no longer have those permissions.\n\n126\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.782\nSo, groups are typically the way to go.\n\n127\n00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:37.390\nIt is the best practice\nin a Microsoft world.\n\n128\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.999\nAnd, so, back to the cumulative thing.\n\n129\n00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.710\nI might have one group for my sales users.\n\n130\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.590\nBut then I also have sales managers.\n\n131\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.360\nAnd my managers need\nto be able to do more.\n\n132\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.880\nThey need to read the report.\n\n133\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.270\nBut they also need to be\nable to modify the report.\n\n134\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.770\nSo I need to give them say\nlet's say we wanna give them\n\n135\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.480\nwrite permissions all right.\n\n136\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.560\nAs a sales manager I need\nall the permissions that\n\n137\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.350\nthe sales users have plus some.\n\n138\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.650\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna take,\n\n139\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.890\nlet's say Wes is my sales manager,\nI can put Wes in that sales group.\n\n140\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.230\nHe'll get read permission from\nbelonging to that sales group.\n\n141\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.880\nOn the access control list I've got\nanother group called sales managers, and\n\n142\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.190\nI'm gonna give the sales\nmanagers group write permission.\n\n143\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.280\nI'm gonna put Wes in both groups.\n\n144\n00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.600\nWes user account is now a member\nof sales users and sales managers.\n\n145\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.120\nSo, Wes gets to add up\nall the permissions.\n\n146\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.200\nHe'll get, say, he'll get read permission\nfrom being part of the sales users group.\n\n147\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.860\nHe'll get write permission from being\npart of the sales managers group.\n\n148\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.270\nSo, in the end,\nWes has read-write permissions.\n\n149\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.800\nAnd that's what we mean by cumulative,\n\n150\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.050\nyou get to add up all the permissions\nfrom the different groups you belong to.\n\n151\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.399\nIt's a cumulative affect, all right.\n\n152\n00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.058\nLet's see what else, let's take\na look at an access control list.\n\n153\n00:07:53.058 --> 00:07:54.769\nSo we're just sitting\nhere talking about it.\n\n154\n00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:59.040\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\nI'm just gonna open up file explorer.\n\n155\n00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.069\nI'll go to my C drive and\nI'll make a new folder so\n\n156\n00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:06.030\nI'll have somewhere to play with.\n\n157\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.890\nWe'll call this Test, and\nI'll go inside there and\n\n158\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:15.150\nI'll make a new document,\nand I'll call it Report.\n\n159\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.024\nAnd you know I'm gonna have to fix that\ntypo there cuz that's just the way I am,\n\n160\n00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:21.680\nall right?\n\n161\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.660\nNow I'm gonna right click on that\nreport and choose properties.\n\n162\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.870\nAnd on the properties of this,\nI'm gonna click on the security tab.\n\n163\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.970\nThe security tab, this is\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n164\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:41.630\nThis is a list of all of the identities\nthat have permissions over this resource.\n\n165\n00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:44.470\nWhere was I gonna go with that?\n\n166\n00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:50.740\nSo each one of these is known as an ACE,\nan access control entry, all right?\n\n167\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.570\nSo if I wanna assign permissions\nto somebody, I can click Edit,\n\n168\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:02.900\nI can click Add, I can find\nWes Bryan's user account and click OK.\n\n169\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.640\nNow there's an ACE,\nan access control entry, for Wes Bryan.\n\n170\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.510\nNow I can control what access\nhe has over this resource\n\n171\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.900\nby changing his NTFS permissions.\n\n172\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.071\nDo I wanna give him full control or\n\n173\n00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:21.220\ndo I wanna give him just a read-permission\nor read and write permission?\n\n174\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.072\nWhat is it that I'm trying to assign or\ndo I wanna deny?\n\n175\n00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:28.662\nI wanna give him read permission but\nI wanna deny any write permission, right?\n\n176\n00:09:28.662 --> 00:09:34.941\nWe can allow, NTFS allows for, I shouldn't\nuse that word twice to define it,\n\n177\n00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:40.660\nNTFS gives me the ability to allow or\ndeny access to a resource.\n\n178\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.510\nNow one thing we should understand,\nI'm gonna cancel.\n\n179\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.400\nI'll just go ahead and leave.\n\n180\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.560\nI don't wanna deny him there.\n\n181\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.432\nWe'll click OK.\n\n182\n00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:46.870\nAnd so now, there we go.\n\n183\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.810\nWes Bryan has an entry and\nit says he has read and\n\n184\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.240\nwrite permissions over this report.\n\n185\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.380\nSo at my discretion, I created a file, I'm\nable to go in and change the permissions.\n\n186\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.300\nNow that can be taken away,\njust as a side note.\n\n187\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.680\nThere are many times where,\n\n188\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.570\nlet's say, a user creates a document\nthat's important to my company.\n\n189\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.150\nIt's a, I don't know, they came up with\nsome spreadsheet that tracks sales and\n\n190\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.190\nI don't want that particular user to\nbe in complete control over that.\n\n191\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.142\nWe can take ownership away, and maybe\nassign it to the Domain Admins Group or\n\n192\n00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:21.753\nsomething like that, so\nthat they can no longer.\n\n193\n00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:23.270\nSo maybe I don't want.\n\n194\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.400\nLet's say Wes was the owner of the file.\n\n195\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.360\nAnd I parked in Wes's\nparking spot this morning.\n\n196\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.880\nSo in order to get back at me,\nWes went and\n\n197\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.960\ntook my permissions away over\nresources that I need to do my job.\n\n198\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.860\nRight, because he can if he was\nthe creator or owner of those resources.\n\n199\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.820\nSo there are times that we take that away.\n\n200\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.160\nBut just understand by default,\n\n201\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.510\ncreator owner, has the ability to\nmodify the access control list.\n\n202\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.690\nAll right,\nwhat else do we need to talk about?\n\n203\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.940\nThe permissions are cumulative.\n\n204\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.740\nAnother thing we need to be familiar\nwith with NTFS permissions,\n\n205\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.540\ndeny will almost always override an allow.\n\n206\n00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.030\nWe're not going to go into\nsuper detail here, but\n\n207\n00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.270\nremember I said permissions\nwere cumulative?\n\n208\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.990\nSo what if Wes belongs to the sales\ngroup and he gets read and\n\n209\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.600\nwrite permission from that?\n\n210\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.650\nAnd let's say I've got another\ngroup called bad actors,\n\n211\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:19.040\nand I deny the permission to read and\nwrite that file to the bad actors group.\n\n212\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.070\nAnd I put Wes in that group.\n\n213\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.650\nBut Wes is in both groups, right?\n\n214\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.020\nHe's in sales users and\nthe bad actors group.\n\n215\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.730\nI start combining permissions,\nhe gets read and write.\n\n216\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.450\nBut he's also been denied read and write.\n\n217\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.736\nWhich one's gonna win?\n\n218\n00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:33.670\nDeny, deny will override the allow.\n\n219\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.150\nYou can belong to 20 groups\nthat allowed you access.\n\n220\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.600\nYou belong to one group\nthat denies you access,\n\n221\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.140\nthe deny is going to override\nall the other allows.\n\n222\n00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.720\nThere are some exceptions to that rule.\n\n223\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.760\nExplicit allows can\noverride inherited denies.\n\n224\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.644\nWe don't really need to get into that\njust yet, but understand it's not 100%.\n\n225\n00:11:53.644 --> 00:11:57.960\nBut most of the time deny\nwill override the allows.\n\n226\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.340\nAll right, so NTFS permissions,\npretty straightforward there.\n\n227\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.470\nEvery object has an access control list.\n\n228\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.042\nWe add entries,\neither a name of a group or\n\n229\n00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:09.422\na user account or\na computer account for that matter and\n\n230\n00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:13.628\nthen we can assign permissions\nusing our little check marks there.\n\n231\n00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:16.220\nWe could either allow,\nwe have allow permissions.\n\n232\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.640\nWe also have deny permissions.\n\n233\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.280\nAnd this is the basis of security in\na Windows environment is using your\n\n234\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.370\ngroups to get gather up users that\nneed the same level of access and\n\n235\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.070\nthen assigning permissions\nover the resources.\n\n236\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.300\nThis is how we make sure that\nsales users can't go look at the,\n\n237\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.960\nI don't know, salary report for\nthe CEOs and things like that, right?\n\n238\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.689\nWe use permissions to\ncontrol that level of access.\n\n239\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.160\nBut that's not the only kind of\npermission we have to deal with,\n\n240\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.000\nwe also need to deal with\nshare permissions, all right.\n\n241\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.890\nWhen we share a resource,\nwe're making it available to the network.\n\n242\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.250\nFor example,\nI've got a folder on a file server\n\n243\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.020\nthat I want people to be able\nto access from their machine.\n\n244\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.960\nThey sit at their laptop or their desktop\nand they can connect to this file server\n\n245\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.770\nand they can see my quarterly reports\nup there for the company, right?\n\n246\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.520\nWell they're reaching out,\nthey're going across the network and\n\n247\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.330\nthey're gaining access to that folder or\nthose files in that folder.\n\n248\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.290\nWe have to give them NTFS permissions\non that file server, on that folder and\n\n249\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.110\nthose files inside that folder.\n\n250\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.740\nWe will have to give them\nthe appropriate NTFS permissions.\n\n251\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.890\nBecause if you don't\nhave NTFS permissions,\n\n252\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.010\nyou don't get access to the resource,\nall right?\n\n253\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.110\nSomething I didn't mention with NTFS,\nthat we should be familiar with,\n\n254\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.380\nis the fact that NTFS\nworks on an implicit deny.\n\n255\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.286\nWhat that means is I don't have to\nadd you to the access control list,\n\n256\n00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.159\nand then deny you access.\n\n257\n00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:44.280\nI just have to make sure\nyoure not in the list.\n\n258\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.960\nIf you're not in the list at all, it's\nalmost the same thing as being added and\n\n259\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.850\nthen the denied check mark checked.\n\n260\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.015\nIf you're not in the list,\nyou don't get access.\n\n261\n00:13:53.015 --> 00:13:58.410\nCuz what happens is Windows has\nyour access token, right, that\n\n262\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.080\nhas your information, and it says okay,\nWes Bryan, and it's looking in that list.\n\n263\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.664\nIf you're not in the access control list,\n\n264\n00:14:04.664 --> 00:14:06.736\nit doesn't know it can't\nassign you any permissions.\n\n265\n00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:09.988\nIt's gonna say, sorry you don't have\nany permissions over this resource,\n\n266\n00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:11.130\nyou don't get access.\n\n267\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.335\n&gt;&gt; Mike, is that like a, let's say\nthat we happen to go out somewhere and\n\n268\n00:14:14.335 --> 00:14:16.260\nit's a reservation only restaurant.\n\n269\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.900\nI go up to the front door and\nsay, my name's Wes Bryan.\n\n270\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.620\nPerson comes here, whatever, looks at it,\nand says hey, you're not on the list.\n\n271\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.370\nYou don't gain access,\nyou don't get any food.\n\n272\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.272\nJust keep me off the list, right?\n\n273\n00:14:26.272 --> 00:14:27.680\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n274\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.480\nNow you might think to yourself,\nwell then why have a deny checkmark?\n\n275\n00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.380\nIf I just make sure you're not on\nthe list, you're gonna get denied.\n\n276\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.970\nWell, there's a difference between\nan implicit and an explicit deny.\n\n277\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.631\nExplicit deny is when I add you to\nthe list and I check the deny check mark.\n\n278\n00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.930\nImplicit deny is then I just\ndon't add you to the list at all.\n\n279\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:45.760\nWhat is the difference?\n\n280\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.330\nWell, lets say I do not want Wes\nto have access to this file so\n\n281\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.590\nI don't put him in the list.\n\n282\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.310\nHe is now implicitly denied,\nhe won't have access to the file.\n\n283\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:01.100\nBut the sales group is in the list and the\nsales group does have access to resources.\n\n284\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.120\nNow unbeknownst to me, some other\nadmin adds Wes to the sales group.\n\n285\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.210\nGuess what Wes can now do?\n\n286\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.630\nHe can now access the resource,\n\n287\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.330\neven though he's not in the list,\nthe sales group is in the list.\n\n288\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.290\nWes is now part of the sales group,\n\n289\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.510\ntherefore he gets all the permissions\nassigned to that sales group.\n\n290\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.260\nSo if I wanna make sure that Wes never\ngets permissions no matter what groups he\n\n291\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.840\nadds to, instead of leaving him out of the\nlist and doing an implicit deny, I'm gonna\n\n292\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.200\nadd him to the list and do an explicit\ndeny- put a check mark in the Deny column.\n\n293\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.960\nSo now, if some other admin\nadds Wes to the Sales group,\n\n294\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.940\nwhen he goes to access the resource,\nit says, Wes, you're part of sales.\n\n295\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.220\nYou get read permission.\n\n296\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.550\nWes, wait, you're in here individually,\nyou're denied.\n\n297\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.210\nDeny overrides the allow,\ntherefore, Wes won't have access.\n\n298\n00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.770\nSo an implicit deny\nversus an explicit deny.\n\n299\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.586\nSo be familiar with that.\n\n300\n00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:54.984\nAll right, so\nback to the whole sharing thing.\n\n301\n00:15:54.984 --> 00:15:56.550\nSo I wanna go across the network and\n\n302\n00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.767\ngain access to this resource\non the file server.\n\n303\n00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:03.224\nWell, I'm gonna need NTFS permissions\nbecause the file server has an NTFS\n\n304\n00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:03.797\nvolume.\n\n305\n00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.589\nThe resources located on it.\n\n306\n00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.320\nThere's an access control list.\n\n307\n00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.250\nI need to be in that list to gain access.\n\n308\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.219\nBut, I also need share permissions\nin order to go across the network\n\n309\n00:16:15.219 --> 00:16:16.799\nto gain access to it.\n\n310\n00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:19.780\nThis is where it gets a little bit tricky,\nall right?\n\n311\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.330\nWhen you access a resource locally,\nin other words, if it's on my machine, for\n\n312\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.070\nexample, right here at\nthe machine I'm sitting at.\n\n313\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.010\nAnd I double click on that resource.\n\n314\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:35.100\nThe only permissions that are checked\nare going to be NTFS permissions.\n\n315\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.430\nBut when I go across the network,\nI need share permissions to get to it.\n\n316\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.160\nAnd the share permissions will\nallow me to get to it, but\n\n317\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.520\nthen I still need NTFS permissions\nto actually access the resource.\n\n318\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.390\nSo if it's a local resource,\nNTFS permissions are gonna be checked.\n\n319\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.600\nIf it's a remote resource,\nyou have to have NTFS permissions and\n\n320\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.110\nshare permissions right?\n\n321\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.822\nShared permissions work very\nsimilar to NTFS permissions.\n\n322\n00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:03.210\nYeah, I can show you one.\n\n323\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.620\nLet me go or let's do this.\n\n324\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.210\nSo, on my, let's see where it is.\n\n325\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.290\nOn Server 1 here,\nI have a folder called data somewhere.\n\n326\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.409\nThere it is.\nI'm going to pull up the properties,\n\n327\n00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:17.700\nright?\n\n328\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.741\nAnd how can I show you this?\n\n329\n00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:21.590\nLet's see,\nthis one's already been shared out.\n\n330\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.933\nLet me go, let's make a new one.\n\n331\n00:17:23.933 --> 00:17:25.090\nAll right?\n\n332\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.812\nSo I'm going to right click, new folder.\n\n333\n00:17:28.812 --> 00:17:32.582\nAnd we will call that guy.\n\n334\n00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.615\nCorp docs.\n\n335\n00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:45.288\nAnd I'm going to right click on it and\npull up my Properties and\n\n336\n00:17:45.288 --> 00:17:51.287\nI'm going to go to the Security tab and\nI'm going to click Edit and\n\n337\n00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:57.199\nAdd, and I'm going to add Mike,\nthat's my user account here.\n\n338\n00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.020\nWe'll check names, make sure it finds me.\n\n339\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.108\nWe'll click OK.\n\n340\n00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:05.719\nAnd we'll give myself read and\nwrite permissions.\n\n341\n00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:08.080\nThen we'll click OK and we'll click OK.\n\n342\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.790\nSo I have NTFS permissions\nover this resource.\n\n343\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.000\nI created this, so\ntechnically I have full control anyway.\n\n344\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.250\nActually, I might be logged\non as administrator here.\n\n345\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.300\nAnyway, that's beside the point.\n\n346\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.899\nSo now I have NTFS permissions.\n\n347\n00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:24.162\nIf I was to log on to this machine,\nI could come in here and\n\n348\n00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:26.530\ndouble click on that and I can access it.\n\n349\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.630\nBut if i go to another machine\nlike my little client over here,\n\n350\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.633\nand I try to go to //svr1/corpdocs,\nwell one ,it's not\n\n351\n00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:41.656\nshared out yet, and two,\nI don't have share permissions.\n\n352\n00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:45.590\nSo let's go share it out and\nmake it available to the network.\n\n353\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.967\nSo I'm going to go back over here to\nCorp Docs, I'm going to right click,\n\n354\n00:18:48.967 --> 00:18:49.635\nProperties.\n\n355\n00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:56.000\nAnd I'm gonna click Sharing, and\nI'm gonna share this resource.\n\n356\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.210\nWhat am I sharing?\n\n357\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.090\nLet's make sure we're clicking\non the right resource,\n\n358\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.700\nI do not want to share the entire C drive.\n\n359\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.950\nThere we go.\n\n360\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.546\nWe'll go Properties, and we'll go Sharing.\n\n361\n00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:13.170\nGo to Advanced Sharing,\nshare this folder, Corp Docs.\n\n362\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.230\nI'm going to go to Permissions.\n\n363\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.140\nAnd I'm actually going to do this\nto be able to show us this issue.\n\n364\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.731\nUnclick Remove to the everyone group.\n\n365\n00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:30.030\nI'm gonna click Add and\nlet's add the IT group.\n\n366\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.302\nWe'll click OK.\n\n367\n00:19:31.302 --> 00:19:34.678\nAnd I'm gonna give them change permission.\n\n368\n00:19:34.678 --> 00:19:40.477\nWe'll click OK, and OK, and OK, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:40.477 --> 00:19:43.160\nAnd let's make sure I did that right.\n\n370\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.030\nI'm going to go to Security tab, and\nI'm going to add my account, Mike.\n\n371\n00:19:52.447 --> 00:19:55.451\nAnd I'm going to give me read and\nwrite permissions over this as well.\n\n372\n00:19:58.354 --> 00:20:02.440\nI keep clicking, somehow my right\nclicking is not doing too well today.\n\n373\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.570\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n374\n00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.970\nProperties, Security, and I knew I had\nadded myself, I have permissions right.\n\n375\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.870\nSo now, I have NTFS permissions,\nmy account.\n\n376\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.000\nThere's a group named IT\nthat has share permissions.\n\n377\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.106\nSo let's see what happens when I\ngo back over to the client, and\n\n378\n00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:22.130\nI'll try to access Corp Docs.\n\n379\n00:20:28.572 --> 00:20:30.960\nSays I can not access it, right?\n\n380\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.250\nContact your administrator to\nrequest access, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:41.121\nSo now I am going to go\nthat group Corp Docs.\n\n382\n00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:43.350\nSorry, not that group, Corp Docs.\n\n383\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.060\nWe're gonna go to the group IT,\nand we're gonna add Mike.\n\n384\n00:20:51.482 --> 00:20:52.520\nClick OK.\n\n385\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.560\nSo now I'm in that group, I'll click OK.\n\n386\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.270\nNow, little trick here,\nwhen I change group membership,\n\n387\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.470\nI am gonna have to log off and\nlog back on.\n\n388\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.429\nSo that I can update my access token.\n\n389\n00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.965\nAnd while I'm doing that,\nlet's talk about that for a second.\n\n390\n00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:15.080\nCuz it is important, in Windows Security,\nwhen you change group memberships,\n\n391\n00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.380\nyou're gonna need to have\nthe person log off and log back on.\n\n392\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.980\nWhen you log on, you get at what\nis known as an access token.\n\n393\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.290\nAnd that includes all the groups\nthat you belong to, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.821\nIf I change your group membership,\n\n395\n00:21:28.821 --> 00:21:31.280\nthat doesn't automatically\nupdate your access token.\n\n396\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.250\nYou got that access token at eight\no'clock this morning when you logged in.\n\n397\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.120\nI added you to that group at\nnine o'clock in the morning so\n\n398\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.880\nit's not on your access token.\n\n399\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.990\nYou need to log off,\nlog back on to get a new access token,\n\n400\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.900\nafter I added you to the group, so that\nit will include your group membership.\n\n401\n00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.194\nSo now that I've logged off and\nlogged back on, let's see what happens.\n\n402\n00:21:51.194 --> 00:21:55.092\n\\\\svr01\\corpdocs and\n\n403\n00:21:55.092 --> 00:21:59.480\nI'm in like Flynn, all right?\n\n404\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.286\nSo what I was trying to show you there was\njust even though I had NTFS permissions,\n\n405\n00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:06.660\nI didn't have share permissions.\n\n406\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.820\nSo I wasn't going to be able\nto access it and vice versa.\n\n407\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.260\nLet's say now I do have share permissions.\n\n408\n00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.310\nWhat would happen if I take\naway my NTFS permissions?\n\n409\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.295\nLet's go back over to Server 1.\n\n410\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.570\nMake sure we right click\non the proper thing.\n\n411\n00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.273\nProperties.\n\n412\n00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:24.338\nWe'll go to Security.\n\n413\n00:22:24.338 --> 00:22:27.629\nWe'll go to Remove My Account.\n\n414\n00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:31.829\nI'm going to Edit, Mike, and\n\n415\n00:22:31.829 --> 00:22:35.880\nI'll just, Remove, Mike.\n\n416\n00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.631\nI'm gonna make sure I'm not in that\ngroup so we'll click OK and OK.\n\n417\n00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:44.230\nSo now I still have share permissions but\nI no longer have NTFS permissions right?\n\n418\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.980\nMy account has been removed.\n\n419\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.290\nSo let's switch back over to the client,\nwe'll close that window, open it up again\n\n420\n00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:59.170\nGo to Corp Docs, and it'll let me do it.\n\n421\n00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.500\nIt probably has something\ncached back there.\n\n422\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.050\nSo that might not have\nbeen the best example.\n\n423\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:08.236\nBut normally, what'll happen is in a\nlittle bit, my access token will tie over,\n\n424\n00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:12.442\nmy session ticket will time out, and I'll\nno longer have access to the resource.\n\n425\n00:23:12.442 --> 00:23:17.274\nBecause NTFS permissions are always going\nto be checked, so just giving somebody\n\n426\n00:23:17.274 --> 00:23:22.440\nshare permissions is not gotta be enough,\nyou've gotta make sure you do both.\n\n427\n00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.160\nAnd the big thing I want you to\nremember here is that NTFS permissions\n\n428\n00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.850\nare always checked, whether you're\naccessing the resource locally or\n\n429\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.210\nwhether you're going across\nthe network to get to the resource.\n\n430\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.870\nShare permissions are only checked when\nyou're accessing it as a share, all right?\n\n431\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:46.970\nAnother scenario, imagine this, let's say\nI shared something out on that server.\n\n432\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.473\nWhat's good way to say this,\nlet's see how I could do this.\n\n433\n00:23:50.473 --> 00:23:53.308\nIf I don't have share permissions,\nthat means I cannot go across the network.\n\n434\n00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:56.558\nSo I've got NTFS permissions but\nI don't have share permissions.\n\n435\n00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:59.630\nI will not be able to go across the\nnetwork and get access to the resource.\n\n436\n00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.285\nBut if I go sit down with that\nserver locally and log on Or\n\n437\n00:24:03.285 --> 00:24:05.839\nif I remote desktop into that server.\n\n438\n00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:09.680\nNow I can access it because,\nI know it sounds funny.\n\n439\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.490\nIt's like wait,\naren't you remote desktoping?\n\n440\n00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.880\nWell remote desktoping is like bringing\nthat desktop locally to you, okay.\n\n441\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.060\nSo now you're doing a local session and\n\n442\n00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.620\nyou would have access even though\nyou didn't have share permissions.\n\n443\n00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.921\nSo hopefully I didn't\nconfuse you too much there.\n\n444\n00:24:22.921 --> 00:24:24.646\nI know that can be a little bit twisty.\n\n445\n00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:27.200\nLet's just roll it back and\nmake it really simple.\n\n446\n00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.707\nNTFS permission's part of the file system,\nalways checked,\n\n447\n00:24:30.707 --> 00:24:33.562\nyou must have NTFS permission\nto access resource.\n\n448\n00:24:33.562 --> 00:24:37.720\nIt's how we control who we can and\ncan't access and what they can do.\n\n449\n00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.090\nShare permissions, only check when you're\ntraveling across the network to get to\n\n450\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:47.950\na resource NTFS permissions are also\nchecked when you go across the network.\n\n451\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.420\nNTFS permissions are always\ngonna be checked.\n\n452\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now when it comes to resources,\nyou've mentioned resources and\n\n453\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.950\naccessing them over the network, and\nyou've talked a lot about folders, right?\n\n454\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.340\nRestricting access to folders.\n\n455\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.220\nBut that's not necessarily the only\nkind of resource that we can share and\n\n456\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.109\npotentially restrict access to, right?\n\n457\n00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:06.395\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\nAnother permission that they're gonna call\n\n458\n00:25:06.395 --> 00:25:07.452\nout in the domains for\n\n459\n00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:11.510\nthis particular exam is to make sure\nwe understand printer permissions.\n\n460\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.670\nCuz printer permissions are a little bit\ndifferent than ntfs and share permissions.\n\n461\n00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.210\nObviously they're gonna\ncontrol access to a printer.\n\n462\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.420\nAnd there's really three permissions that\nwe deal with when we deal with printers.\n\n463\n00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.329\nThere's the print permission.\n\n464\n00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:27.698\nThere's the Manage Documents permission,\nand\n\n465\n00:25:27.698 --> 00:25:32.220\nthere's the Manage This Printer\npermissions, right?\n\n466\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.120\nI've got a printer I\nthink installed on here.\n\n467\n00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.741\nSo let me pull that up, and\nsee if I can show you that.\n\n468\n00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:42.070\nWhere did I stick that guy?\n\n469\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.516\nThere it is.\nThis is the one that's local to me here\n\n470\n00:25:49.516 --> 00:25:54.257\nand that is not going to show you,\nthere we go.\n\n471\n00:25:54.257 --> 00:26:00.670\nYou know what, this is good old Windows\n10 and some of the ways it does things.\n\n472\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.074\nThere we go.\nJust a different way to get to\n\n473\n00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:02.976\nthe same thing, right.\n\n474\n00:26:02.976 --> 00:26:07.414\nI could have gone to printers and devices\nand right clicked on the printer and\n\n475\n00:26:07.414 --> 00:26:12.406\nshows printer properties and got to this\nsame dialogue box, good old Windows 10 and\n\n476\n00:26:12.406 --> 00:26:14.304\nit's a new way of doing things.\n\n477\n00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:18.740\nAnyway, you see that I just\npulled up the printer.\n\n478\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.370\nAnd I clicked on printer properties and\nit opened up that same dialogue box.\n\n479\n00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.100\nIf I went to devices and\n\n480\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.090\nprinters, which is the older\nschool way of doing things, right?\n\n481\n00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.598\nI could have right clicked\non that printer and\n\n482\n00:26:32.598 --> 00:26:35.778\nshows printer properties and\ngot the exact same screen.\n\n483\n00:26:35.778 --> 00:26:38.598\nSo there's two different ways\nto get to the same place.\n\n484\n00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:40.260\nAll right, and\non the properties of this printer,\n\n485\n00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.260\nnow notice I did say printer properties.\n\n486\n00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.270\nDo be careful with that one.\n\n487\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.200\nWhen I right click on this printer,\nthere's a properties, and\n\n488\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.650\nthere's a printer properties.\n\n489\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.900\nIf I click Properties,\nit doesn't look the same, does it?\n\n490\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.030\nIt's got General, and it's got Hardware.\n\n491\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:59.280\nThis is really dealing with the properties\nof the physical device, drivers,\n\n492\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.450\nthings like that.\n\n493\n00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.401\nWhen you do Printer Properties, you're\ntalking more about the logical object,\n\n494\n00:27:04.401 --> 00:27:06.074\nthe printer, where we send jobs.\n\n495\n00:27:06.074 --> 00:27:10.480\nThey get spit out to the digital printer,\nso, just a little terminology.\n\n496\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.080\nMake sure you click on the right one.\n\n497\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.070\nBut notice there is a security tab.\n\n498\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.230\nWhen we look at the security tab,\n\n499\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.560\nwe don't see the same permissions\nthat we would on on NTFS object.\n\n500\n00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.450\nWe don't see read, write, read and\nexecute, modify, full control.\n\n501\n00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.460\nAll we see is print, manage this printer\nand manage documents, all right?\n\n502\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.380\nLet's talk about what\nthose permissions mean.\n\n503\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.590\nPrint allows you to send\na job to the printer and\n\n504\n00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.720\nhave it actually print\nit out as a hard copy.\n\n505\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.872\nManage this printer would allow me\nto change settings for the printer.\n\n506\n00:27:41.872 --> 00:27:45.550\nIs it allowed to print in color,\ncan it do two sided printing,\n\n507\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.250\ncollation, that kind of thing.\n\n508\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.680\nActually managing the settings for\nthe printer itself and\n\n509\n00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.090\nthen manage documents allows me to work\nwith the print queue for this printer.\n\n510\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.330\nSo I can see all the jobs\nthat are waiting.\n\n511\n00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.810\nI can pause jobs, I can restart jobs,\n\n512\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:04.250\nI can cancel jobs, I can reorder\njobs if I have manage documents.\n\n513\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.980\nThe default permissions,\nvery important for\n\n514\n00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.640\nus to understand this, is everyone\nis given print permission, right?\n\n515\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.410\nSo the everyone group is actually\nassigned print permission by default.\n\n516\n00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.525\nThat means when you install a printer,\nin a Windows environment,\n\n517\n00:28:19.525 --> 00:28:23.890\nanybody can send a print\njob to that printer.\n\n518\n00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.312\nThe creator and you can see right here\neveryone has allow print permission if you\n\n519\n00:28:28.312 --> 00:28:32.470\ncan that it's kind of a grayed out but\nthat's the allow print permission.\n\n520\n00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.460\nThe creator owner is assigned\nmanage document permission but\n\n521\n00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.310\nthink about what the, or let's make sure\nwe understand what that's saying there.\n\n522\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.610\nThe creator owner has managed documents.\n\n523\n00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:51.900\nThat means if you're the creator owner\nof that document, you can manage it.\n\n524\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.350\nBut if you're not the creator owner,\nyou can't manage it.\n\n525\n00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.650\nSo everybody can print.\n\n526\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.610\nI can send print job to the printer.\n\n527\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.210\nWes can send a print job to the printer.\n\n528\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.940\nI can manage my print job.\n\n529\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.220\nI sent it to the printer.\n\n530\n00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.080\nI am the creator owner of that print job.\n\n531\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.730\nTherefore if I want to I can stop my job.\n\n532\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.260\nI can restart my job and\nI can cancel my job.\n\n533\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.850\nBut I didn't create Wes's print job.\n\n534\n00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.544\nSo I cannot stop Wes's print job.\n\n535\n00:29:16.544 --> 00:29:18.520\nI can't cancel it, right?\n\n536\n00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.830\nI can't restart it.\n\n537\n00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.720\nWes can cancel his job,\nbut he can't cancel mine.\n\n538\n00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.550\nCuz he's not the creator or owner of mine.\n\n539\n00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:29.140\nSo by default everybody can print, and\neverybody can manage their own print jobs.\n\n540\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.810\nBecause the creator or\n\n541\n00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.470\nowner's given the manage print,\nor manage documents permission.\n\n542\n00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:40.420\nNow if I add somebody to this list,\nand I give them managed documents.\n\n543\n00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.120\nThat's different.\n\n544\n00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.230\nI'm not saying the creator owner,\nI'm saying Wes,\n\n545\n00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.370\nyou have manage document\npermission over this printer.\n\n546\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.140\nNow Wes can manage every print job\non that printer, not just his own\n\n547\n00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.520\nbecause I've said Wes, you're now\nin charge of managing documents.\n\n548\n00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.910\n&gt;&gt; Would that be like saying basically, I\nnow have permissions over the print queue?\n\n549\n00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.460\nAnd I can manage the queue itself?\n\n550\n00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:01.991\n&gt;&gt; That's it, [CROSSTALK] that's right.\n\n551\n00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.500\nYou can cancel jobs, you can reorder jobs.\n\n552\n00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.450\nBump yours to the top of the list so\nthey print before everybody else's.\n\n553\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.530\nYou know, cancel mine so\n\n554\n00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:13.010\nI'm standing at the printer going, when\nis my print job gonna print, good golly!\n\n555\n00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.212\nAnd unbeknownst to me,\nWes has canceled my print job.\n\n556\n00:30:15.212 --> 00:30:21.260\nSo you do want to be careful who you\nassign the manage documents permission to.\n\n557\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.970\nBecause they can now manage\nall documents on that printer.\n\n558\n00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.150\nThe managed printer, that'd be\nsomething I'd typically assign to maybe\n\n559\n00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.840\nsomebody that sits close to\nthe printer in a small shop.\n\n560\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.650\nOr we've got our help desk people\nthat I might assign that to.\n\n561\n00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.080\nBecause again,\nthey can handle the settings for\n\n562\n00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.030\nthe configuration on the printer itself.\n\n563\n00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:44.850\nWhen you plug in,\nif I hook up a printer to my laptop here,\n\n564\n00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.590\nthat's available to me and\nthe accounts on this particular machine.\n\n565\n00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.650\nWhat if I want Wes to be able to print to\nthe printer that's attached to my machine?\n\n566\n00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.730\nI can share it out.\n\n567\n00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.936\nJust like I can share a folder,\nwe were talking about that a minute ago,\n\n568\n00:30:57.936 --> 00:30:59.430\nI can share a printer.\n\n569\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.221\nAnd when I share it everybody\nhas print permissions, so\n\n570\n00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:05.408\nWes can now browse the network.\n\n571\n00:31:05.408 --> 00:31:06.633\nFind that printer,\n\n572\n00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:11.546\nadd it to his list of printers he can now\nsubmit print jobs to my printer all right?\n\n573\n00:31:11.546 --> 00:31:14.260\nAnd typically it's actually set.\n\n574\n00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.036\nLet's do that.\nLet's add a printer.\n\n575\n00:31:15.036 --> 00:31:16.796\nI'm going to click add a printer.\n\n576\n00:31:16.796 --> 00:31:20.519\nNow I'm going to lie to it because I don't\nactually have a printer sitting here on\n\n577\n00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:21.027\nthe desk.\n\n578\n00:31:21.027 --> 00:31:23.486\nSo I'm going to say, add a printer.\n\n579\n00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:26.530\nA local printer manually.\n\n580\n00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.880\nI'll click Next.\n\n581\n00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.340\nI'll use an existing port.\n\n582\n00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.604\nWe'll do LBD2.\n\n583\n00:31:30.604 --> 00:31:34.700\nAnd I'll just say, hey, you know what,\nI bought this Canon inkjet 0278.\n\n584\n00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.590\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n585\n00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.920\nAnd I'll give it a name,\nsomething a little more meaningful there.\n\n586\n00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.446\nWe'll get rid of the extra\nstuff all right.\n\n587\n00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:44.840\nAnd it lets me print a test page.\n\n588\n00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.600\nSo now I have this new printer.\n\n589\n00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.882\nWhere did I put it?\n\n590\n00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:49.800\nThere it is, Canon inkjet.\n\n591\n00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.630\nIf I right click on it, and\nchoose printer properties.\n\n592\n00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.049\nI don't have to worry about\ngiving Wes permissions.\n\n593\n00:31:56.049 --> 00:31:59.507\nBecause everyone has print\npermission by default.\n\n594\n00:31:59.507 --> 00:32:02.616\nBut he won't be able to connect to it,\nbecause I haven't shared it yet.\n\n595\n00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:07.383\nOnce I click-on the sharing tab, I can\nclick change settings and I need to be\n\n596\n00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:12.619\nan admin on this machine so I'll do,\nI'll provide some additional credentials.\n\n597\n00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:22.710\nAnd I'll check share this printer\nI can give it a share name.\n\n598\n00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:26.340\nAnd I can also choose to\nlist this in the directory.\n\n599\n00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.290\nIn a work group this option wouldn't be\nhere or it wouldn't make any difference.\n\n600\n00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:35.210\nBut in Active Directory this can make it\neasier for my users to find the printers.\n\n601\n00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.965\nAnd I'll come back to that\nhere in just a second.\n\n602\n00:32:36.965 --> 00:32:41.730\nAnd so I'll click OK and\nnow the printer is shared.\n\n603\n00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:47.310\nSo Wes would be able to go to his printers\nand devices, click Add a Printer and\n\n604\n00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.710\nthen it would show up in this list,\nhopefully, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n605\n00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.010\nHe might have to browse for it and know it\nby name and that's when he calls me up.\n\n606\n00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.060\nBut hopefully he can find it.\n\n607\n00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.190\nIn a domain environment,\nit becomes much easier.\n\n608\n00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.421\nNow, typically, we don't have printers\nattached to individual machines.\n\n609\n00:33:03.421 --> 00:33:06.390\nOr, at least,\nnot as common anymore, all right?\n\n610\n00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.600\nWe have centralized printers,\nthe big bizhubs, the Canons,\n\n611\n00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.968\nthose big monstrosities,\nthey do everything.\n\n612\n00:33:12.968 --> 00:33:16.250\nAnd they're network-based printers and\nthey're managed by a print server,\n\n613\n00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.950\nusually a Window Server.\n\n614\n00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.360\nRight, and I've got something set up\nlike that here over on server one.\n\n615\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.850\nServer one is a print server, so\nI'm gonna open up my print management,\n\n616\n00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:33.340\nand I've got a printer called\nHP Color LaserJet attached to this guy,\n\n617\n00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.226\nand I wanna add that on my client.\n\n618\n00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:40.765\nSo, I'm gonna go to my client, And\nI'm gonna open up devices and printers.\n\n619\n00:33:43.215 --> 00:33:45.160\nCuz I'm old school,\nI like to do it that way.\n\n620\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.415\nAnd I'm gonna click Add Printer.\n\n621\n00:33:50.784 --> 00:33:55.241\nAnd notice it doesn't show up or\nit doesn't look like it's gonna show up,\n\n622\n00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:56.490\nall right?\n\n623\n00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:01.070\nThis is where advertising or listing in\nan Active Directory makes it easier for\n\n624\n00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.392\nyour end users.\n\n625\n00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:07.346\nI'm gonna pull up the properties\nof that printer And\n\n626\n00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:11.830\nI'm gonna go to the sharing tab,\nwhich I've already shared it out.\n\n627\n00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.870\nBut notice my client was still\nhaving trouble finding it.\n\n628\n00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.840\nAnd we choose list in the directory.\n\n629\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.860\nThis is gonna add it to that database\nwe talked about earlier that handles\n\n630\n00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.390\nall of our accounts.\n\n631\n00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:29.491\nNow I'm gonna go back over the client and\ntry that again.\n\n632\n00:34:29.491 --> 00:34:30.799\nAnd watch it not find it again.\n\n633\n00:34:30.799 --> 00:34:34.973\n[LAUGH] Silly,\nlet's close the whole window and\n\n634\n00:34:34.973 --> 00:34:38.009\nmake it start from the beginning.\n\n635\n00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:45.185\nThen we'll go devices and\nprinters, And we'll add a printer.\n\n636\n00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:52.950\nYep, the printer wasn't listed,\nlet's find a printer\n\n637\n00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:57.520\nin the directory based on the location or\nfeature, no, time out.\n\n638\n00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.224\nAnd now it shows up.\n\n639\n00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:03.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], no.\n\n640\n00:35:03.103 --> 00:35:05.823\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n641\n00:35:05.823 --> 00:35:08.410\nwe'll just edit that back to\nwhere I opened up this window.\n\n642\n00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.810\nAnd look there it is.\n\n643\n00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.592\n&gt;&gt; Now what do you wanna-\n&gt;&gt; Right, we can make that work, I think.\n\n644\n00:35:11.592 --> 00:35:13.832\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we are up on time.\n\n645\n00:35:13.832 --> 00:35:14.551\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n646\n00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:15.511\n&gt;&gt; What do you want-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n647\n00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:17.487\nwe'll have to do the next ones in a,\nit's just a part two.\n\n648\n00:35:17.487 --> 00:35:18.223\n&gt;&gt; Do you wanna a part two?\n\n649\n00:35:18.223 --> 00:35:19.350\nOkay, just making it sure.\n\n650\n00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.900\nI didn't know what to exactly go there.\n\n651\n00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.400\nOkay, cool.\n\n652\n00:35:23.022 --> 00:35:24.400\n[LAUGH] man, that stinks.\n\n653\n00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.698\nSo we'll have to figure out a way to\ncut it back in where it ends, and\n\n654\n00:35:27.698 --> 00:35:28.530\nthere's the printer.\n\n655\n00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.200\nLook, right?\n\n656\n00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, can just cut to.\n\n657\n00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, remove-\n&gt;&gt; It's finished.\n\n658\n00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And all this stuff on screen.\n\n659\n00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.853\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n660\n00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:36.722\n&gt;&gt; So whenever you're ready.\n\n661\n00:35:36.722 --> 00:35:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n662\n00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.590\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow that we've listed it in the directory,\n\n663\n00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.450\nit pops right up when we click next.\n\n664\n00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.610\nAnd it's basically gonna grab the driver,\npull it down from the print server, and\n\n665\n00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.370\ninstall it on my local machine,\nand I can now print.\n\n666\n00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.210\nThere it is right there, if I scroll down,\nthere's my HP Color LaserJet.\n\n667\n00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.857\nSo, again,\nwhen dealing with permissions on printers,\n\n668\n00:35:56.857 --> 00:35:58.322\nyou've got three to deal with.\n\n669\n00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:00.828\nYou've got the print permission itself,\n\n670\n00:36:00.828 --> 00:36:06.460\nyou've got manage the documents permission\nand manage this printer permission.\n\n671\n00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.549\nWhen you have a printer that's not local\nto you it's gonna have to be shared out.\n\n672\n00:36:10.549 --> 00:36:15.628\nOnce you shared out, people can access\nthat printer across the network and\n\n673\n00:36:15.628 --> 00:36:17.730\nthey can send print jobs to it.\n\n674\n00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Very good, lot of great information\nwhen it comes to permissions there, Mike.\n\n675\n00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.220\nNow, I know that we\njudge by the notes here,\n\n676\n00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.720\nI know we've got a little bit more to\ngo but also judging by the time clock,\n\n677\n00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.690\nlooks like we're coming the end\nof another episode, Mike.\n\n678\n00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:33.870\nSo what do you say we go ahead and\nmaybe save another cliffhanger and\n\n679\n00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.810\ngo into a part two?\n\n680\n00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:35.800\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n681\n00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that sounds\nlike a great place to wrap up.\n\n682\n00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.650\nThank you for being here, Mike, and\nthank you to the viewer for watching.\n\n683\n00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.697\nSigning out for IT Pro TV.\n\n684\n00:36:42.697 --> 00:36:44.581\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n685\n00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:45.518\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n686\n00:36:45.518 --> 00:36:46.327\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:11.710\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.850\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.040\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore of that GSEC fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.600\nAnd this is actually a part two, we've\nbeen looking through, and at I should say,\n\n8\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.620\nWindows permissions.\n\n9\n00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.210\nWell, we left off with a few other\nthings that we have to talk about and\n\n10\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.090\nwell joining me back in the studio's\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.150\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Wes, thanks for\nhaving me back, excited to be back and\n\n13\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.760\ndoing our GIACG Sec.\n\n14\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.260\nAnd you're right we were talking\nabout Windows permissions,\n\n15\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260\nwe looked at NTFS permissions,\nwe looked at shared permissions,\n\n16\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.740\nwe've looked at printer permissions.\n\n17\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.870\nSo a lot of permissions there, and\nwe do still have a couple of areas that\n\n18\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.108\nthey specifically call out in\nthe objectives for this exam.\n\n19\n00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:53.470\nSo I wanna make sure we go over them and\nthat is gonna be,\n\n20\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.970\nregistry key permissions, and\nActive Directory permissions.\n\n21\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.168\nA couple of other places\nwe can control permissions.\n\n22\n00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:03.630\nAnd we're gonna start with\nregistry permissions, and\n\n23\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.750\nI'll be honest with you Wes.\n\n24\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.450\nThis is something that, I've been doing\nthis for, I don't know, 15 years,\n\n25\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.170\na little longer.\n\n26\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.750\nAnd I think I've had to change registry\npermissions maybe once or twice.\n\n27\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.182\nIt's not something that\nwe do on a daily basis.\n\n28\n00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:21.700\nYeah, and when it comes to the registry I\ntypically, is it an administrative user or\n\n29\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.460\nis it a standard user and\nwe let the user account control take in.\n\n30\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.190\nSo this one, I'm gonna be learning too,\nthis is gonna be interesting.\n\n31\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I said,\n\n32\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.525\nit's just not something you do every day,\nalthough there are certain times.\n\n33\n00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.315\nYou've got applications\nthat create registry keys,\n\n34\n00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:38.805\nand maybe when that user's using that\napplication they need to be able to,\n\n35\n00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:42.210\nsomething they do in the application\nhas to write into the registry.\n\n36\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.447\nAnd you get an access denied,\nyou might have to go in and\n\n37\n00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:47.137\nadjust permissions in\nthere in the registry.\n\n38\n00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:50.107\nSo it is something that we should\nat least be familiar with.\n\n39\n00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.537\nAlso when it comes to\nsecuring our systems,\n\n40\n00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:56.133\nmaking sure that everything\nis safe from the bad guys.\n\n41\n00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.923\nWe might wanna review\npermissions on the registry and\n\n42\n00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:01.483\nmake sure they're set properly or\nhaven't been changed.\n\n43\n00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:03.123\nSo let's just take a look at it,\n\n44\n00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:07.543\nthere's a couple of ways we can\nwork with registry permissions.\n\n45\n00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:11.170\nWe can do it on an individual machine\nwe can actually use something called\n\n46\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.140\nGroup Policy,\n\n47\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.390\nwhich we haven't learned about yet,\nto set registry permissions as well.\n\n48\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.140\nSo, the first thing I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna, well go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.120\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n50\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.830\nI'm just on a Windows 10 machine, and\n\n51\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.520\nI'm gonna type in reg edit which is our\nregistry editor in a Windows environment.\n\n52\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.080\nAllows me to edit the registry,\nsurprise, surprise.\n\n53\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.710\nSo I'm gonna come down to, I don't know,\nlet's just say HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\n\n54\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.970\nAnd I'll pick any one,\nI'm not gonna do anything in particular.\n\n55\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.440\nI just wanna show you because\nthey're all gonna work the same.\n\n56\n00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.528\nSo if you have an application\nthat created a registry entry,\n\n57\n00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:51.080\nyou have to know where it was and\nhere most likely be HKEY Local Machine,\n\n58\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.590\nMicrosoft software,\nwhatever the case maybe.\n\n59\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.350\nBut when you find the key, you're gonna\nright click on it and choose permissions.\n\n60\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.648\nAnd it looks a lot like my MTFS\npermissions and my Share permission for\n\n61\n00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:07.180\nthat matter but the permissions\nthemselves are a little bit different.\n\n62\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.128\nI have full control and\nwe have read permission,\n\n63\n00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:14.450\nall right so full control and\nread but that's not all that we get.\n\n64\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.030\nWe do have our advanced permissions as\nwell so I'm gonna click on advanced cuz I\n\n65\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.570\njust want you to see what permissions\nare available on these registry keys.\n\n66\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570\nI clicked advanced, and then I'm going to,\n\n67\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.660\nlet's do,\nI'll just select somebody here and click.\n\n68\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.170\nActually I'll add somebody,\nthen I'll select a principal.\n\n69\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.790\nAnd we'll do Wes, somebody who has\nan account in my little test lab.\n\n70\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.100\nAnd I'll click OK, you do have to pick\nsomebody in this new style dialog box\n\n71\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.270\nthat you're gonna assign\nthe permissions to.\n\n72\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.330\nSo I chose Wes, and then I'm gonna click\nshow advanced permissions over here on\n\n73\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.940\nthe right-hand side.\n\n74\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.996\nAnd here's all the different\npermissions I can set on a registry.\n\n75\n00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:59.890\nFull control, pretty self-explanatory\nright, I can do anything I want to that\n\n76\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.410\nkey, add a value, create a sub-key,\nchange a value, delete a key.\n\n77\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.910\nWhat have you, there's query value,\nwhich is basically, kind of like read.\n\n78\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.630\nIt would let your account access that\nkey and see what the value is set to.\n\n79\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.000\nAnd now that I think about it too another\nuse of changing these might be for\n\n80\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.870\nthe application itself, right.\n\n81\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.070\nYou might not be adding a principle\nof a user like I am here,\n\n82\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.380\nWes, I might be adding some application,\ngive it permissions.\n\n83\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.090\nOr some service for\nexample that has an account, but\n\n84\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.190\nquery lets you read\na value of a registry key.\n\n85\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.920\nSet value would let you change a value or\nset that value for that particular key.\n\n86\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.100\nCreate sub key,\nwell create a key within a key,\n\n87\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.610\nand registry keys are really\njust storage locations.\n\n88\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.914\nEnumerate sub keys, that would allow\nme to take a particular key and\n\n89\n00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:57.947\nsee what sub keys existed\nunderneath that key.\n\n90\n00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:03.463\nNotify if there was a change to the key,\ncreate a symbolic link, delete the key,\n\n91\n00:05:03.463 --> 00:05:09.160\nchange the permission list, write DAC,\nDiscretionary Access Control, right.\n\n92\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.382\nSo, if I have write DAC that means I\ncan open this up and change who has or\n\n93\n00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:17.260\ndoesn't have permissions over\nthis particular registry key.\n\n94\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.688\nChange who the owner is of the registry\nkey, and then read control,\n\n95\n00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.340\nwhich is the default permission there.\n\n96\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.369\nI'm not gonna make any changes,\nI don't wanna hose my machine, so\n\n97\n00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.550\nI'm just gonna cancel my way out of here.\n\n98\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.970\nAgain, the most important thing to learn\nhere is that I can go to individual\n\n99\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.610\nkeys in the registry and\n\n100\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.680\nI can control what level of access\nsecurity principles have over those keys.\n\n101\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Now I've kinda taken this for\ngranted because if I'm doing,\n\n102\n00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.810\nif I'm making a registry modification.\n\n103\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.380\nI'm just like, Mike,\n\n104\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.281\nI'm doing very sparingly cuz I can hose up\nthe machine with the best of them here.\n\n105\n00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I was a standard user and\n\n106\n00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:53.190\nI did come to a point where it said to\nmake this application do such and such.\n\n107\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.050\nCreate a D word 32 bit value I would need\none of those permissions if I'm a standard\n\n108\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.640\nuser to go in there and do it.\n\n109\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.460\nI just kind of assume since I'm the\nadministrator well ha ha I can do anything\n\n110\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.580\nI want, but this would be a good place\nwhere you might set something like that.\n\n111\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.108\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and its a big security\nprinciple, principles at least privilege.\n\n112\n00:06:12.108 --> 00:06:16.230\nIt's not like way back in the day when we\nmade everybody administrators on their own\n\n113\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.908\nmachines.\n\n114\n00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:19.780\nSo they could install software or\ndo what have you, and\n\n115\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.515\nwe wanna restrict that access and\nthis is just another way we can control.\n\n116\n00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:27.345\nBut when we do restrict it,\nthen sometimes we'll take it all back, and\n\n117\n00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.825\ngive them just what they\nneed to do something.\n\n118\n00:06:29.825 --> 00:06:32.625\nAnd that's when you have to come in\nhere and make those kind of changes.\n\n119\n00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.345\nSo that's one way you can\nmake changes to the registry.\n\n120\n00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:39.245\nAnother way would be group policy, now,\nwe haven't learned about group policy yet.\n\n121\n00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:45.090\nThat's coming up in some\nepisodes in the GSEC series.\n\n122\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.420\nBut for now, let's just, I'm gonna jump\nover to my domain controler really quick.\n\n123\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.330\nAll right and we're gonna close whatever\nwe have opened for our last episode and\n\n124\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.890\nI'm gonna open up a group\npolicy management console.\n\n125\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.530\nAgain let's just do a real quick\ndefinition of a group policy,\n\n126\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.450\na group policy is a way that\nI can apply settings and\n\n127\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.280\nconfigurations from a central location.\n\n128\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.290\nRather, let's say we wanted\n\n129\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.370\nto install software on all the people\nin the sales department's computers.\n\n130\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.260\nAnd that software needed to have pertinent\npermissions over a registry key or\n\n131\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.480\nthe user would need permissions over\nthat registry key, to run that software.\n\n132\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.090\nWell I could go to each one of those\nsales users' machines, open up Regedit,\n\n133\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.760\nand apply the appropriate permission for\ntheir account, right.\n\n134\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.960\nDefinitely possible, and if I got two or\nthree sales users, maybe that's what I do.\n\n135\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.100\nI say, hey, bring your laptop\nby when you get a chance.\n\n136\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.860\nAnd I'll go ahead and set that up for\nyou and change that permission.\n\n137\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.780\nBut as our company grows and\nwe get larger and I have 20,\n\n138\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.940\n30, 100 salespeople having\nthem stop by my office.\n\n139\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.676\nSome of them might not even,\nthey might be remotely located.\n\n140\n00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:54.545\nSo is there a way that I can do\nthis from a central location?\n\n141\n00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:56.763\nThat's what group policy is all about,\n\n142\n00:07:56.763 --> 00:07:59.707\nis really being able to make\na configuration change.\n\n143\n00:07:59.707 --> 00:08:04.035\nFrom a centralized location, and\nhave it applied to several users,\n\n144\n00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:06.210\nand/or machines on our network.\n\n145\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.850\nAnd we'll definitely go into a little\nbit more about group policy.\n\n146\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.700\nIn this particular exam,\n\n147\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.100\nyou don't have to be a Windows Engineer,\nor anything like that, right?\n\n148\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.360\nBut we do have to have eye level\nunderstanding of all of these topics.\n\n149\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.690\nSo, we'll definitely come\nback to group policy.\n\n150\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.110\nFor now, I just want to show you how I\ncan make registry changes using a policy.\n\n151\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.660\nSo, I'm gonna whip up\na new policy real quick.\n\n152\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.570\nI'll call it regedit,\nor reg, modification.\n\n153\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.590\nThen I'll click OK.\n\n154\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.460\nAnd then I'm gonna right-click on\nthat new policy and choose Edit.\n\n155\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.200\nBasically, makes changes to that\nblank policy that I just created.\n\n156\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.147\nThe settings I'd be looking for,\nis be under Computer &gt; Policies &gt;\n\n157\n00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:55.110\nWindows Settings, then it takes it\na minute to expand this part out.\n\n158\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.800\nAnd then Security Settings,\nand then Registry.\n\n159\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:07.550\nSo here, I can right-click and\nchoose Add Key.\n\n160\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:13.590\nAnd then I can come in here, and I could\nfind a key, and I could create a new key.\n\n161\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.020\nLet's see, what's something I can\ndo that I won't goof up anything?\n\n162\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.370\nWe'll go hardware descriptions,\nthey sound pretty simple.\n\n163\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.810\nWe'll click OK, and look at there.\n\n164\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.320\nThere is my access control list for\nthat particular key.\n\n165\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.110\nAnd so I could come in here, and\nI could add, and I could do sales.\n\n166\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.650\nI think I created that sales group.\n\n167\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.200\nWe'll click OK, remember,\nthat contains all my sales users.\n\n168\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.560\nSo, I don't have to do individuals.\n\n169\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.660\nI don't have to list all 150 salespeople\nhere in the access control list.\n\n170\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.910\nI can just add sales, and I can give them\nRead Permission over this particular key.\n\n171\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.380\nOr if I wanted to do more than that,\nI click Advanced, all right.\n\n172\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.910\nAnd I can click Sales,\nand I can click Edit.\n\n173\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.064\nAnd I can show advance permissions.\n\n174\n00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:04.089\nAnd maybe I want them to be able to create\nsubkeys, because maybe the application\n\n175\n00:10:04.089 --> 00:10:07.954\nthey're running needs to do that,\nit needs to create a subkey or something.\n\n176\n00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:10.200\nAnd I click OK, and OK, and OK.\n\n177\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.460\nAnd do I want this to inherit\ndown into keys underneath?\n\n178\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.101\nIf there's already a subkey, the\npermission I'm assigning, do they now have\n\n179\n00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:26.479\npermission for that subkey to read and\ncreate subkeys under that, right?\n\n180\n00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:31.956\nOr do I wanna just for this key, I don't\nwant it to inherit down to any other keys,\n\n181\n00:10:31.956 --> 00:10:34.064\nall right, so I'll click OK.\n\n182\n00:10:34.064 --> 00:10:35.300\nAnd there we go.\n\n183\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.290\nSo basically, the same thing I\ndid by going into regedit, and\n\n184\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.530\ndoing it on an individual machine,\nI've now done using a policy, right?\n\n185\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.370\nAnd the advantage is that this policy will\nbe applied to all of my domain computers.\n\n186\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.390\nWell, it's very controllable.\n\n187\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.190\nI can say just the computers\nin the Sales Department, or\n\n188\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.590\njust the marketing users,\nor everybody at branch A.\n\n189\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.630\nI mean, group policy is very,\nvery powerful and very customizable.\n\n190\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.780\nBut now, I don't have to go\ntouch every single sales user.\n\n191\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.318\nAnd if we hire three new sales people\ntomorrow, and give them laptops and\n\n192\n00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:11.415\nput them in that sales group, it's done.\n\n193\n00:11:11.415 --> 00:11:13.786\nI don't have to do anything,\nthe policy's already set.\n\n194\n00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:16.854\nAs soon as they connect to the domain,\nand group policy gets applied,\n\n195\n00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:19.780\nthat key will be set, and\nthe permissions will be set on it.\n\n196\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.380\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a great way to do that\ncentralized management there, Mike, where\n\n197\n00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.580\nmaybe you're a midsized organization, you\nhave a help desk, and they do everything.\n\n198\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.498\nRight, many roles,\n\n199\n00:11:29.498 --> 00:11:32.664\nmaybe you're a large organization\nwhere you have application support.\n\n200\n00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:35.924\nThis will be a good way that you can\njust give that whole entire team that\n\n201\n00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:39.903\ndoes application support the ability to\nmake the modifications in the application,\n\n202\n00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:41.575\nor on the computers that they need.\n\n203\n00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.720\nAnd they're not calling you 100 times\na day, Mike, I need to do this.\n\n204\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.700\nHey Mike, I need to do this.\n\n205\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.850\nSo, again, looks like I benefit with\nthe group policies with that centralized\n\n206\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.370\nmanagement\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, as I was trying to think of\n\n207\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.460\na time when I've actually done this\nin a production environment, and\n\n208\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.825\nit was a old TightVNC, that I needed to\nhave installed on all these different\n\n209\n00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:05.550\nlab machines that my students were using,\nand it needed a registry key modification.\n\n210\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.670\nAnd now I can't, it's been years,\n\n211\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.460\nI can't remember for\nthe life of me why I needed to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.060\nI was trying to remember, and I can't.\n\n213\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.495\nBut that was an example of when I\nneeded to go in and modify registry\n\n214\n00:12:16.495 --> 00:12:21.430\npermissions to give TightVNC the ability\nto restore information in that registry.\n\n215\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.990\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the ones that I think\nabout, and I would like to had it at this\n\n216\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.420\ntime, it would've saved me that hassle\nof going from computer to computer.\n\n217\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.900\nYou should've talked to me back then,\nwas auto log on.\n\n218\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.083\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where we had to make it easier in\n\n219\n00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.020\na classroom environment.\n\n220\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.170\nThe students didn't have to\nworry about the password.\n\n221\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.459\nWe wanted to be able to auto log on,\nbut unfortunately,\n\n222\n00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:38.666\nI wasn't smart enough to\ndo it through group policy.\n\n223\n00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:40.103\nSo, it was a lot of manual labor there.\n\n224\n00:12:40.103 --> 00:12:43.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you go into each machine,\nopen up the registries,\n\n225\n00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:46.739\nchanging that to a one, when you could\nhave used a policy, done it once, and\n\n226\n00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:49.540\nhad it applied to all the machines\nthat you chose to, so.\n\n227\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.620\n&gt;&gt; Great, now you tell me.\n\n228\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] fun stuff.\n\n229\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.630\nAll right, so\nthat's basically registry permissions.\n\n230\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.100\nAgain, the big thing I\nwant you to grasp here\n\n231\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.530\nis that you can go to each individual key.\n\n232\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.710\nIt has its own access control list, you\ncan control the permissions there, you can\n\n233\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.690\nalso use group policy to centralize this\nprocess, and do it from one location,\n\n234\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.720\nif you need it to apply to several users,\nor several machines.\n\n235\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.210\nAll right, next thing,\nI'm gonna close group policy.\n\n236\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.630\nAnd the next thing I wanna talk about is\nactually Active Directory permissions,\n\n237\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.420\nall right.\n\n238\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.070\nWe've mentioned that\nterm a couple of times,\n\n239\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.720\none of our earlier Windows episodes.\n\n240\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.200\nWe talked about how when we create\na domain, we're installing the tole\n\n241\n00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.855\nActive Directory domain services,\nand then we get that database,\n\n242\n00:13:35.855 --> 00:13:39.640\nthat centralizes administration and\nauthentication.\n\n243\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.680\nAll the accounts get stored there.\n\n244\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.720\nAll the computers trust that security, or\n\n245\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.480\nthat Active Directory Database\non that domain controller.\n\n246\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.170\nAnd so we've got that single\nsign on capability now,\n\n247\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.360\nwhere I can sign on to any machine\nthat trusts my domain controller,\n\n248\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.550\nusing that one account\nstored in Active Directory.\n\n249\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.829\nWell, we need to be able to understand\nActive Directory permissions.\n\n250\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.810\nBecause Active Directory is, well,\nwhat's a good way to start with this?\n\n251\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.410\nThere are times when I wanna give\npeople the ability to go in and\n\n252\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.460\nwork with objects in Active Directory.\n\n253\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.180\nNow, Active Directory,\n\n254\n00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.740\nas I said earlier, it's where all\nof my user accounts are stored.\n\n255\n00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.120\nAnd let's just open up\nActive Directory and\n\n256\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.320\nwe'll kind of look at it\nwhile we're talking about it.\n\n257\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.260\nSo, here's Active Directory users and\ncomputers.\n\n258\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.164\nAs I said, we've got organizational units,\n\n259\n00:14:30.164 --> 00:14:33.319\nI've got an employee's OU.\n\n260\n00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:37.130\nAnd then within that OU,\nI've got nested OUs.\n\n261\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.530\nI've got user accounts in here,\nand let's take sales, for example.\n\n262\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.860\nIn sales,\nI've got my different sales users here.\n\n263\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.410\nSo, this is their user account that\nthey use to log in to the machine.\n\n264\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.210\nNow, sales is one of those\ndepartments that, a lot of times,\n\n265\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.200\nhas a high turnover, right?\n\n266\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.990\nYou've got people coming and going.\n\n267\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.760\nNot ITProTV, our sales guys are great,\nand they are with us for life, hopefully.\n\n268\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.260\nHopefully I saved my butt on that one.\n\n269\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.720\nMy sales guys are watching,\nthere's not a high turnover.\n\n270\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.660\nNo, but it is one of those departments,\nI guess, that tend to have a little\n\n271\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.420\nbit of a high turnover, or at least in\nother companies that I've worked for.\n\n272\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.035\nI'll digress,\nI'll get off of that for a second.\n\n273\n00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:19.857\nSo, I don't even remember now\nwhere I was going with that.\n\n274\n00:15:19.857 --> 00:15:22.734\nWe got our user accounts in this OU,\nand as I was saying,\n\n275\n00:15:22.734 --> 00:15:25.072\nsales, they're always hiring new people.\n\n276\n00:15:25.072 --> 00:15:28.936\nAnd every time we hire somebody, I've got\nto come in here and create an account for\n\n277\n00:15:28.936 --> 00:15:32.240\nthem, so they can log in, and\nI've gotta add it to the sales group, so\n\n278\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.315\nthey get all the appropriate permissions.\n\n279\n00:15:34.315 --> 00:15:39.120\nAnd in order to be able to create objects\nin here, you need to have permissions,\n\n280\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.950\nas a domain admin I have permissions.\n\n281\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.857\nBut what I wanna do is I want to delegate.\n\n282\n00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:46.847\nI want Peter, who's my sales manager,\n\n283\n00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:49.196\nwe're gonna pretend\nhe's the sales manager.\n\n284\n00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:52.059\nAnd I'm tired of him calling\nme up every day saying, hey,\n\n285\n00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:55.341\nI've got three new people that I've hired,\nI need new accounts.\n\n286\n00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:58.237\nThe next day, hey, two of those\npeople never even showed up for\n\n287\n00:15:58.237 --> 00:16:00.928\ntheir interview,\nI need you to get rid of those accounts.\n\n288\n00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:02.201\nAnd then the next day, guess what?\n\n289\n00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:04.658\nThey just showed up,\ncan we make those accounts again?\n\n290\n00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:05.658\nI'm like, you know what?\n\n291\n00:16:05.658 --> 00:16:06.931\nI want you to deal with it.\n\n292\n00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:11.390\nI'm gonna let you deal with creating\nthose accounts for your sales users.\n\n293\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.801\nBut I'm not gonna make\nPeter a domain admin.\n\n294\n00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:19.020\nHe doesn't know anything about managing\nActive Directory, he's my sales manager.\n\n295\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.110\nHe's the sales guru and\nhe manages the sales people but\n\n296\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.800\nhe doesn't know Active Directory.\n\n297\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.210\nSo I'm not making it a Domain Admin,\n\n298\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.260\nbecause as Domain Admin, you would have\nfull control over Active Directory.\n\n299\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.030\nYou can create, delete anything you\nwanted out of Active Directory.\n\n300\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.970\nYou could just uninstall Active Directory,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n301\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.880\nThat would be a bad day for\nyour corporate environment.\n\n302\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.140\nSo I need to be able to\ngive him permissions,\n\n303\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.860\nwithout making him a domain admin.\n\n304\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.110\nAnd it's relatively easy.\n\n305\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.210\nIt's very very similar to\nassigning NTFS permissions.\n\n306\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.920\nEach one of these objects inside active\ndirectory has its own access control list.\n\n307\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.780\nAnd I can control what the people can\ndo or not do within active directory.\n\n308\n00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.920\nBy default, everyone gets read permission\nin active directory because you\n\n309\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.350\nneed to be able to, as a standard user,\nwe added a printer in a previous episode.\n\n310\n00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.420\nHow did I do that?\n\n311\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.110\nWell, because the printer was listed\nin active directory when the admin\n\n312\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.540\nshared it out, my user account,\nnot an admin, I'm just a standard user,\n\n313\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.060\nis able to browse active directory and\nshow me a list of all the printers.\n\n314\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.950\nAnd I can pick the one I want because\nI have reformation overactive record.\n\n315\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.069\nSo everybody can read active directory,\nright?\n\n316\n00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:30.796\nBut in order to make changes or\n\n317\n00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:34.770\ncreate new objects I'm gonna need\nto be assigned that permission.\n\n318\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.556\nSo let's take again Peter for example.\n\n319\n00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.301\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nshow you a couple of ways.\n\n320\n00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:42.838\nI'm gonna show you the wrong way and\nthe right way to do it [LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:17:42.838 --> 00:17:46.760\nOr the, what's a better way to say this?\n\n322\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.530\nI don't think it's a wrong way.\n\n323\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.180\nWell, I'll show you what I mean.\n\n324\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.780\nI'm gonna right click on this sales OU and\nchoose properties.\n\n325\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.590\nAnd notice I do not have a security tag.\n\n326\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.160\nOne of the first things we're\ngonna learn about Active Directory\n\n327\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.090\nis it hides stuff from you to\nkeep you safe from yourself.\n\n328\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.120\nSo I'm gonna cancel that, because I\nfeel like I know what I'm doing and\n\n329\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.060\nI wanna see the security tab.\n\n330\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.190\nHow do I show it?\n\n331\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.760\nYou go to the View menu in the Active\nDirectory Users and Computers, and\n\n332\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.050\nyou choose Advanced Features.\n\n333\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:25.150\nNow, when I expand out employees, I right\nclick on sales, and I choose properties.\n\n334\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.830\nI get a whole bunch more tabs.\n\n335\n00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.220\nOne of them being the security tab.\n\n336\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.240\nAlright.\nSo now I've got my access control list for\n\n337\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.470\nthat particular OU, that sales OU.\n\n338\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.470\nSee up there,\nI'm looking at sales properties.\n\n339\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:44.250\nIf I look at the everyone group,\nnotice they don't have read here.\n\n340\n00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.234\nI'm sorry the authenticate use there\nwe go, have a special permission.\n\n341\n00:18:47.234 --> 00:18:52.700\nAnd if I click advanced and\nI look at the special permissions for\n\n342\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.073\nthe authenticated users,\n\n343\n00:18:55.073 --> 00:19:00.761\nwill click edit I should see that\nthey have list and read and read.\n\n344\n00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:06.058\nNow, so I can assign\nthe permissions here for Peter.\n\n345\n00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:08.320\nI just wanted to show you what\nthe authenticated user had.\n\n346\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.786\nSo lets' say I wanna\ngive Peter permissions.\n\n347\n00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:15.437\nI can click add and I can give Peter,\nfind his user account,\n\n348\n00:19:15.437 --> 00:19:19.410\nadd him to the access control list.\n\n349\n00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.601\nAnd now I can give him permissions,\nall right?\n\n350\n00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:22.513\n[COUGH].\n\n351\n00:19:22.513 --> 00:19:27.241\nPermissions for Active Directory\nare behaviorally they're the same as\n\n352\n00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:29.653\nNTFS permissions for the most part.\n\n353\n00:19:29.653 --> 00:19:31.480\nBut the permissions\nthemselves are different.\n\n354\n00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.770\nWe don't have read and write and\nmodify and full control.\n\n355\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.990\nWe have a large list of permissions.\n\n356\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.824\nThis is just a subset of them here.\n\n357\n00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:41.410\nWe have read and write.\n\n358\n00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.960\nCreate all child objects,\ndelete all child objects.\n\n359\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.990\nChild options should be\nobjects inside this OU, right?\n\n360\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.980\nI right clicked on an OU,\npulled up it's properties.\n\n361\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.980\nSo I'm saying,\ncould Peter create objects inside the OU?\n\n362\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.380\nCould Peter delete objects inside the OU?\n\n363\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.510\nNot the OU itself, right?\n\n364\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.900\nOnly child objects.\n\n365\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.150\nObjects inside that OU.\n\n366\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.800\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n367\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.220\nGenerate RSOP's that'll\nbe in group policy.\n\n368\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:16.050\nI'll click the advanced and I'm gonna show\nyou some other permissions, eventually.\n\n369\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.170\nOnce my computer decides to show it to us.\n\n370\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.784\nCuz there are a lot more\npermissions than that.\n\n371\n00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:26.248\nActive Directory the permissions,\nyou can get extremely granular.\n\n372\n00:20:26.248 --> 00:20:29.831\nAnd I'm gonna cancel this out,\nit's not responding here,\n\n373\n00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:32.368\nand we're going to have to reset that guy.\n\n374\n00:20:32.368 --> 00:20:35.410\nI made it mad,\nclicking on too many things too fast.\n\n375\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.568\nSo, we'll go back to employees,\nall right, click on Sales,\n\n376\n00:20:39.568 --> 00:20:43.499\nchoose Properties and\neven my view reset, it's all gone.\n\n377\n00:20:43.499 --> 00:20:46.561\nWe'll go to view, advanced features, and\n\n378\n00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:51.790\nthen we'll pull up that OU again,\nright click, properties, security.\n\n379\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.270\nPeter's probably not in there anymore.\n\n380\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.620\nNope, so it had glitched out.\n\n381\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.083\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick add, I'll find Peter.\n\n382\n00:21:04.726 --> 00:21:06.510\nI'll click OK.\n\n383\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.228\nAnd now Peter is in there.\n\n384\n00:21:08.228 --> 00:21:12.440\nI'm gonna go ahead and apply that change,\nso I don't make it too mad again.\n\n385\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.798\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick Advanced.\n\n386\n00:21:13.798 --> 00:21:16.660\nWe'll see if it gets\na little friendlier with me.\n\n387\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.047\nThere we go.\n\n388\n00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:22.050\nAll right, now I'm gonna find\nPeter's account, and choose Edit.\n\n389\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.390\nSo I can show you the rest\nof the permissions.\n\n390\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.658\n&gt;&gt; Wow that's a lot.\n\n391\n00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lot of permissions.\n\n392\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:38.095\nBasically you can get down to,\nlike take a user account for example.\n\n393\n00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:42.000\nLike user account, you guys can probably\nfigure out, has a first name, a last name,\n\n394\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.910\na phone number, I can give Peter\npermission to change the phone number and\n\n395\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:46.900\nnothing else.\n\n396\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.200\nNot the fax number, not the address,\nnot the last name, just the phone number.\n\n397\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.660\nIt's that granular, which is great for\n\n398\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.830\nus because there are times when I\nneed to have that level of control.\n\n399\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.944\nSo you'll see, let's see, this is an OU.\n\n400\n00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.200\nSo it's not gonna have\nthe same set of permissions.\n\n401\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.570\nBut that's it.\n\n402\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.000\nOther than what the permission\nspecifically are,\n\n403\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.530\nit's very similar to NTFS, right?\n\n404\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.920\nI find the account, the security principle\nthat I want to assign the permission to,\n\n405\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.180\nI add it to the access control list, and\n\n406\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.190\nthen I choose what permissions\nI wanna give them.\n\n407\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.280\nIf I wanna give them full control, or\n\n408\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.520\nif I wanna give them just delete or\ntake delete away.\n\n409\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.440\nI'm gonna cancel that out before I do\ngive them control over everything and\n\n410\n00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.990\ngo back in there.\n\n411\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.570\nAll right?\n\n412\n00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:35.260\nThe other thing I wanna show you that's\ndifferent from NTFS is this applies to.\n\n413\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.600\nSo in NTFS permissions I had an allow\ncolumn and a deny column for\n\n414\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.910\ncheck marks, right?\n\n415\n00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.480\nHere, you get a drop down list.\n\n416\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.820\nWhat are you trying to do,\nallow a permission?\n\n417\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.180\nOr are you trying to deny a permission.\n\n418\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.710\nAnd then we'll check\nwhat permission it is.\n\n419\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.610\nBut you also have this applies to.\n\n420\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:57.515\nWith NTFS permissions, when you assign\na permission to a folder, it automatically\n\n421\n00:22:57.515 --> 00:23:01.710\ninherits to all the objects inside\nthe folder, which is fantastic.\n\n422\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.870\nIf I've got a folder of 1,000 resources,\n1,000 different documents, and\n\n423\n00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.610\nI want the salespeople to be\nable to read those documents,\n\n424\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.980\nI darn sure don't wanna go to\n1,000 different documents.\n\n425\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.950\nEven if I've got a group and\nnot individual users,\n\n426\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.970\nit's still gonna be tedious,\nright-clicking on each document,\n\n427\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.650\nadding the sales group, and\ngiving it read permission.\n\n428\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.680\nAll right?\n\n429\n00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.176\nSo what I can do is go to the folder\nitself, assign the permission, and\n\n430\n00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:27.866\nit'll inherit down to all\nthe objects inside there.\n\n431\n00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:29.930\nIt's one of the great things about NTFS.\n\n432\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.980\nWith Active Directory,\nwe can control that a little bit easier.\n\n433\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.650\nI can say this object only.\n\n434\n00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.910\nWhat if I wanna give him permissions over\nthe OU but not the objects inside the OU?\n\n435\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.800\nOr as I was saying earlier, all the send\nin objects, which is basically the same\n\n436\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.910\nthing as child objects that we\nsaw a list on that permission.\n\n437\n00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:52.338\nSo, he won't be able to, I want Peter\nto be able to delete user accounts.\n\n438\n00:23:52.338 --> 00:23:56.588\nIf one of those sales people leave, I want\nhim to be able to remove that account, but\n\n439\n00:23:56.588 --> 00:24:00.780\nI don't want him to accidentally delete\nthe OU and delete all the sales accounts,\n\n440\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.386\nso I could say, you know what?\n\n441\n00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:07.947\nI'll give him the ability to delete But\nonly descendant objects,\n\n442\n00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:13.948\nnot the OU itself, and I'll click OK,\nand OK, and OK, all right?\n\n443\n00:24:13.948 --> 00:24:17.996\nSo there is assigning permissions,\nthat's basically the manual process for\n\n444\n00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:19.355\nassigning permissions.\n\n445\n00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:21.279\nBut here's the thing\nwith Active Directory,\n\n446\n00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:23.162\nyou saw how granular\nthose permissions get.\n\n447\n00:24:23.162 --> 00:24:28.075\nAnd sometimes it's tricky to know what\npermission I need to give you in order\n\n448\n00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:30.320\nto accomplish a particular task.\n\n449\n00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.920\nIn order to reset a password, do you\nneed read permission over the object?\n\n450\n00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.060\nDo you need write\npermission over the object?\n\n451\n00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.060\nI mean, what do you need to\nbe able to reset a password?\n\n452\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.420\nI want my help desk to be\nable to reset passwords.\n\n453\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.540\nI'd have to do some research, I'd have to\nlook at those hundreds of permissions or\n\n454\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.050\ndozens at least of permissions to figure\nout what you needed in order to reset.\n\n455\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.440\nLuckily for us,\nin Windows there's a delegation wizard.\n\n456\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.570\nA delegation wizard allows me to\ndelegate permissions to a user or\n\n457\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.700\nto a group of users\ngoing through a wizard.\n\n458\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.025\nAnd letting the wizard do it.\n\n459\n00:25:06.025 --> 00:25:10.300\nI tell the wizard what I want this user or\ngroup of users or computer to do,\n\n460\n00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.400\ncuz you're gonna assign permissions\nto computers as well, right?\n\n461\n00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.420\nLike, what's a good example\nI run into the other day?\n\n462\n00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.230\nGosh, now I can't think of it.\n\n463\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.850\nIt needed a permission to modify.\n\n464\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:29.480\nI think it was it was Windows\ndeployment services, right?\n\n465\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.131\nIt needed to be able to modify\nthe computer objects in Active Directory.\n\n466\n00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:36.862\nSo I had to give the Windows deployment\nserver permissions over the OU so that\n\n467\n00:25:36.862 --> 00:25:40.537\nwhen I have to deploy out new machines\nusing Windows deployment services,\n\n468\n00:25:40.537 --> 00:25:43.978\nit can automatically join them to\nthe domain and create the account for\n\n469\n00:25:43.978 --> 00:25:46.160\nthat computer in Active Directory.\n\n470\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.110\nSo I had to delegate to a machine,\npermissions in Active Directory.\n\n471\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.430\nSo it's not just users or\ncomputers, all right?\n\n472\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.360\nBut the cool thing about\nthe delegation wizard is,\n\n473\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.580\nagain, it knows what permissions I\nneed to accomplish certain tasks.\n\n474\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.560\nAnd I can just let the wizard do it for\nme.\n\n475\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.190\nCuz you saw permissions\ncan get crazy granular.\n\n476\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.330\nLet's pull up the permissions for\na user account.\n\n477\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.600\nI'm gonna right-click Properties,\nand I go to that Security tab, and\n\n478\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.830\nI'm gonna click Advanced.\n\n479\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.530\nAnd I'm going to select one of\nthese guys and hit edit, so\n\n480\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.640\nwe can see the permissions here.\n\n481\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.550\nAnd look how short my\nlittle scroll thing is.\n\n482\n00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.918\nThat gives you an indicator of\nhow long this list is gonna be.\n\n483\n00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:29.400\nAnd as I go through here, you'll see\nthat it is a really, really long list.\n\n484\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.850\nBecause every single individual\nproperty has a permission for it.\n\n485\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.440\nWrite home address, read home drive.\n\n486\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.860\nWrite home drive, read home folder.\n\n487\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.900\nIf we find there is information about\nlike phone numbers and addresses, and\n\n488\n00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.590\nthere is write fax number,\nread fax number.\n\n489\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.350\nSo every single thing you can\nfill in over a user account,\n\n490\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.930\nhas it's own permissions over it.\n\n491\n00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.550\nWe typically don't need to get quite\nthat granular, I'll be honest with you.\n\n492\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.390\nBut it is nice to know that we can,\nif we need to.\n\n493\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.610\nThere's also some permission sets.\n\n494\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.940\nLike instead of saying,\nchange phone number.\n\n495\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.300\nLet's see if I can find one for\nyou real quick.\n\n496\n00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.172\nJust finding permissions\nin here can be tricky.\n\n497\n00:27:12.191 --> 00:27:17.860\nI don't see one off the top of my,\nreal quick.\n\n498\n00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.730\nAnyway, the point I was trying to\nmake is like address information.\n\n499\n00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:26.220\nI can give you permission over\nthe address, the work address, or\n\n500\n00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.070\nthe home address, or there's actually\na permission for address information\n\n501\n00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:35.230\nas a group so I don't have to do it\nindividually, which is kind of nice.\n\n502\n00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.110\nAnywho, lots of permission.\n\n503\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.780\nSo back to what I was talking about.\n\n504\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.740\nYou've got to watch me, Wes,\nI get sidetracked all the time.\n\n505\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.100\nThere's just so much cool stuff to\ntalk about in Active Directory.\n\n506\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.970\nSo the delegation wizard is gonna simplify\nthe assigning permissions, right?\n\n507\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.260\nBecause I can tell it\nwhat I need it to do,\n\n508\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.040\nand it will take care of assigning\nthe permissions for me, right?\n\n509\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.970\nNow a couple of things we wanna do, best\npractices for using the delegation wizard.\n\n510\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.740\nFirst and foremost,\ndo not delegate to a user.\n\n511\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.420\nDon't manually do it to a user either.\n\n512\n00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.710\nYou saw what I did with Peter?\n\n513\n00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:05.520\nThat's a big no, no.\n\n514\n00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.130\nYou're really not supposed to assign\npermissions to a user account.\n\n515\n00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.460\nYou can, and it works just fine.\n\n516\n00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.500\nBut it's not the best practice.\n\n517\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.190\nYou always want to assign permissions.\n\n518\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.330\nAnd we take this back.\n\n519\n00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.980\nTake what I'm saying right here,\nback to those other episodes as well.\n\n520\n00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.180\nNTSF permissions,\n\n521\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.950\nyou really don't want to assign\npermissions directly to a user account.\n\n522\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.540\nYou always want to assign\npermissions to a group.\n\n523\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.010\nWhether it's NTSF permissions,\nwhether is share permissions,\n\n524\n00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.300\nwhether it's registry permissions,\nwhether it's printer permissions,\n\n525\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.340\nwhether it's Active Directory permissions,\nall right?\n\n526\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.270\nWhy?\n\n527\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.560\nBecause it simplifies administration.\n\n528\n00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.230\nBecause today Wes is the only\none that needs that permission.\n\n529\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.800\nSo I might think it's easier just\nto assign that permission to Wes.\n\n530\n00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.070\nTomorrow, next week, next month,\nthat won't be the case.\n\n531\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.020\nWe'll hire three new people that\nalso need to do what I just gave Wes\n\n532\n00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.540\npermission to do.\n\n533\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.370\nNow, I've got to do it three more times.\n\n534\n00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.180\nIf I had created a group, and\nput Wes's account in the group and\n\n535\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.330\nassigned the permission to the group.\n\n536\n00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.490\nWhen we hire those three new people, I\njust have to put them in the group, right?\n\n537\n00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.710\nIt makes administration\na whole lot easier.\n\n538\n00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.120\nSo I'm gonna follow best practices\nhere when I go through my delegation.\n\n539\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.110\nBecause I wanna delegate to a group,\nnot to an individual user.\n\n540\n00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.762\nEven if its a group of one, because whats\none today won't be one tomorrow, right?\n\n541\n00:29:18.762 --> 00:29:21.462\nYou wanna look down the road,\na month from now, a year from now,\n\n542\n00:29:21.462 --> 00:29:24.480\nfive years from now, how can I make\nmy life easier as an administrator?\n\n543\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.102\nSo always delegate to groups.\n\n544\n00:29:26.102 --> 00:29:29.800\nAll right, so let's say that I wanna\ndelegate, to the, let's create a group.\n\n545\n00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.260\nLet's make sure I have one\ncalled sales admin or managers.\n\n546\n00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.080\nSo there's a group called managers.\n\n547\n00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.428\nLet's make sure we put Peter\nin that managers group.\n\n548\n00:29:42.224 --> 00:29:45.980\nAll right, so I added Peter to the group,\nso he's part of the managers group.\n\n549\n00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:52.020\nNow I'm gonna delegate to him permissions\nto work with objects inside the sales OU.\n\n550\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.092\nSo how do I do it?\n\n551\n00:29:53.092 --> 00:29:58.720\nYou saw I could right click on it, pull up\nthat group or Peter and add permissions.\n\n552\n00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.841\nThis time I'm gonna use the wizard,\nI'm gonna right click on sales and\n\n553\n00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:03.050\nchoose delegate control.\n\n554\n00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.430\nAnd that launches my delegate wizard,\nI'll click Next, and its\n\n555\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.860\njust simply gonna ask me a few questions,\nwho are you trying to delegate to?\n\n556\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.030\nI'll click Add, well, the managers group.\n\n557\n00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.490\nI'll check names and OK.\n\n558\n00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.400\nAnd it says,\n\n559\n00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.150\nall right, well, now I know who you're\ntrying to delegate permission to.\n\n560\n00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.814\nWhat are you trying to delegate?\n\n561\n00:30:22.814 --> 00:30:24.525\nAnd there's a list of common tasks.\n\n562\n00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:26.962\nThere's like 13 of them here or so or 9 or\n\n563\n00:30:26.962 --> 00:30:30.840\n13 common tasks like create,\ndelete and manager user accounts.\n\n564\n00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.210\nWell, perfect, that's exactly what I\nwanted to give the sales managers.\n\n565\n00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.710\nThe ability to give to create and\ndelete and\n\n566\n00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.320\nmanage those user accounts within that OU.\n\n567\n00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.590\nAll right, great.\n\n568\n00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.670\nI'll go ahead and do that.\n\n569\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.190\nIf the task that I wanted\nto do wasn't in this list,\n\n570\n00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.740\nthen I could choose create\na custom task delegate.\n\n571\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.490\nWhen you do custom task,\n\n572\n00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.440\nyou're gonna have to choose from\na list what you're trying to do.\n\n573\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.536\nAll right, and it is a weird list.\n\n574\n00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:01.120\nI mean not a weird, but\na relatively long list but\n\n575\n00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.910\njust about everything we need\nis going to be in there.\n\n576\n00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:07.220\nI'm gonna go back and\njust stick with my pre-built task.\n\n577\n00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.879\nA little tidbit I'll throw in here, just a\nfreebie for you, if you out to Microsoft,\n\n578\n00:31:11.879 --> 00:31:15.050\ndo a little searching,\nthese tasks that are in this list,\n\n579\n00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.277\ncome from a file called Delegwiz.ini.\n\n580\n00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:20.530\nAnd, like I said, there's 9 or 13 of them.\n\n581\n00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.920\nIf you go out and do a little search\non Microsoft site, you can find\n\n582\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:31.310\na Delegwiz.ini replacement will add 72\ntasks to your list and it's really nice.\n\n583\n00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.850\nSo if you're a Windows admin,\nyou should definitely look for that.\n\n584\n00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.150\nAll right, so I want to delegate,\ncreate, delete, manage user accounts.\n\n585\n00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.420\nI'll click Next.\n\n586\n00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.530\nIt now knows who I'm trying to delegate\nto, what I'm trying to delegate to them,\n\n587\n00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.990\nand that was it.\n\n588\n00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.515\nI click Finish.\n\n589\n00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:48.975\nAnd I'm done.\n\n590\n00:31:48.975 --> 00:31:52.415\nNow, here's the cool thing about the way\nthese permissions are working, all right?\n\n591\n00:31:52.415 --> 00:31:56.593\nYou might think, well, what's to stop him\nfrom going up to the domain admins and\n\n592\n00:31:56.593 --> 00:31:58.200\nworking with those accounts?\n\n593\n00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.123\nNow can he delete domain admins?\n\n594\n00:32:00.123 --> 00:32:03.294\nCan he change the password on\nmy enterprise admin account?\n\n595\n00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:03.988\nNo.\n\n596\n00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:07.829\nBecause I right-clicked and\ndelegated over just the Sales OU,\n\n597\n00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:11.700\nonly in the Sales OU does\nPeter have any permissions.\n\n598\n00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.980\nLet's right-click on that Sales OU and\nchoose Properties.\n\n599\n00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.720\nAnd let's look at that Security tab.\n\n600\n00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.780\nWe're gonna click Advanced.\n\n601\n00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.160\nWe're gonna find Peter.\n\n602\n00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.230\nI'm sorry, not Peter, but\nthe managers cuz we used the group, right?\n\n603\n00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.270\nAnd it also says you Create,\n\n604\n00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:33.060\nDelete User Objects as well as full\ncontrol over Descendant Objects, right?\n\n605\n00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.210\nLet's see if it gave me anything else.\n\n606\n00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:42.040\nLet's grab one of those guys and\nclick Edit.\n\n607\n00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.080\nAnd we could scroll through here and\n\n608\n00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.240\nwe could figure out what the delegation\nwizard actually assigned them.\n\n609\n00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.786\nAlthough I didn't see anything off the top\nof my head or off that first view.\n\n610\n00:32:55.786 --> 00:32:57.640\nWow, I actually don't\nsee anything checked.\n\n611\n00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.469\nIs it me, am I just going too fast?\n\n612\n00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.440\nInteresting but\nit did give them full control and\n\n613\n00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.060\ncreate, delete and user objects,\nwhich is actually kinda proves my point.\n\n614\n00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.880\nI don't know exactly what permission\nI would have needed to check and\n\n615\n00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.175\nI still don't know.\n\n616\n00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:15.375\nBut I do know that Peter or\n\n617\n00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:20.085\nanybody in the manager's group now has\nthe appropriate permission, all right?\n\n618\n00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:21.985\nSo that's the delegation wizard.\n\n619\n00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:24.195\nThat's how you wanna assign permissions.\n\n620\n00:33:24.195 --> 00:33:26.335\nLet the wizard do it for you.\n\n621\n00:33:26.335 --> 00:33:31.495\nIf you do it manually, you really have to\nunderstand those granular permissions and\n\n622\n00:33:31.495 --> 00:33:33.655\nknow exactly what you wanna assign.\n\n623\n00:33:33.655 --> 00:33:35.750\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith doing it manually.\n\n624\n00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.310\nThe big thing is,\nit's easier with a wizard.\n\n625\n00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.870\nBut whether you're doing it manually or\n\n626\n00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:44.430\nwith a wizard use groups,\ndon't use individuals.\n\n627\n00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.415\nThe other big advantage of\ndelegating to a group, all right,\n\n628\n00:33:48.415 --> 00:33:50.113\nthis is an important one.\n\n629\n00:33:50.113 --> 00:33:52.660\nThere is no undelegate wizard.\n\n630\n00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.470\nYeah, think about that for a second.\n\n631\n00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.600\nThere's no undelegate wizard, right?\n\n632\n00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.750\nIf I assign these permissions\nto Peter directly.\n\n633\n00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.160\nAnd now,\nPeter no longer needs that responsibility.\n\n634\n00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.940\nLet's say he's moved to\na different department.\n\n635\n00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.130\nI don't want him creating and\ndeleting sales user accounts anymore.\n\n636\n00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.759\nSo I need to take those\npermissions away from him.\n\n637\n00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:16.230\nI don't even know what permissions\nit was assigned in the first place.\n\n638\n00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.820\nNow I gotta figure out a way to\nremove those permissions, and\n\n639\n00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.730\nthere is no undelegate, right?\n\n640\n00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.520\nThere's no wizard to\nremove the permissions.\n\n641\n00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.350\nIf I had delegated to a group, all I have\nto do is pull Peter out of the group.\n\n642\n00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.340\nAnd now Peter's no longer\npart of the group,\n\n643\n00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.030\nhe's no longer gonna\nget those permissions.\n\n644\n00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.340\nI can just leave the empty group.\n\n645\n00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.840\nWe're eventually gonna hire\nanother sales manager.\n\n646\n00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.300\nThat new sales manager is gonna need to be\n\n647\n00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.440\nable to manage those user\naccounts in Active Directory.\n\n648\n00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.510\nI've still got a group,\nit's still been delegated to,\n\n649\n00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.610\nall I have to do is put that new sales\nmanager in that group and I'm done, right?\n\n650\n00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.280\nSo make sure you're using groups and\nnot individual users when you're working,\n\n651\n00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.590\nreally, with any permissions but\n\n652\n00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.970\nespecially when you're delegating\npermissions in Active Directory.\n\n653\n00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.834\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that is a lot of great\ninformation about permissions.\n\n654\n00:34:58.834 --> 00:35:03.104\nAnd my new slogan for Active Directory,\nafter seeing that slew of granular\n\n655\n00:35:03.104 --> 00:35:06.810\npermissions, is complexity\nthrough granularity, for sure.\n\n656\n00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're glad we got you here\n\n657\n00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.070\nto help make it a little\neasier to understand.\n\n658\n00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.990\nNow judging by that time clock, it does\nlook like we're coming to the end of\n\n659\n00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.140\nanother episode, Mike, but before we do,\ndo you got any additional words of wisdom\n\n660\n00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.730\nyou might wanna impart to our viewers when\nit comes to managing your permissions?\n\n661\n00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.360\n&gt;&gt; The main thing is documentation is\nvery important when you're working\n\n662\n00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.030\nwith permissions, good documentation can\nmake troubleshooting so much easier.\n\n663\n00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.530\nSo document what you're doing and\nthen follow the best practices.\n\n664\n00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.130\nAlways assign permissions.\n\n665\n00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.090\nDelegate permissions.\n\n666\n00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.480\nWhatever it is you're doing to groups.\n\n667\n00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.810\nAnd then control who has the permission\nby changing the membership of the group.\n\n668\n00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, words of wisdom from Mr.\nRoderick.\n\n669\n00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.870\nWe appreciate you being\nin the studios with us.\n\n670\n00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:49.870\nWe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n671\n00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.170\nSigning out for ITProTV.\n\n672\n00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.030\nI've been

GIAC Security\nFundamentals, also known as GIAC.\n\n9\n00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.323\nAnd joining us in the studio for\n\n10\n00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.980\nthis endeavor It's none other than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.220\nMike how are you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.870\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.215\nAnd in this episode we are gonna\nbe looking at Windows Updates,\n\n15\n00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:32.741\nexciting stuff here right.\n\n16\n00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:37.400\nYou know and you might think well what\nare we gonna learn about Windows updates.\n\n17\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.321\nMost of you have run a Windows\noperating system before,\n\n18\n00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.370\nyou're familiar with a Windows update,\nyou know what else is there.\n\n19\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.947\nWell there's a couple of the things\nthat we need be familiar with for\n\n20\n00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:52.470\nthis exam especially and just for\nmanaging an enterprise environment.\n\n21\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.250\nSo let's start with just\nsome terminology right?\n\n22\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.350\nWe know we have Windows updates.\n\n23\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.528\nBut there's actually different\nclassifications of updates.\n\n24\n00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.440\nAnd you might or\nmight not be familiar with this.\n\n25\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.940\nYou've got things like hot fixes and\nservice packs, and\n\n26\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.200\ntools, and updates, and patches.\n\n27\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.345\nAll these different terms, they're all\nreferring to the same thing or no.\n\n28\n00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.700\nThey're actually not, right?\n\n29\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.027\nPeople try to use the terms\ninterchangeably sometimes or\n\n30\n00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:21.122\nwe just say blanket,\nyou know, Windows updates.\n\n31\n00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.640\nAnd, does it matter to us?\n\n32\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.650\nYes and no.\n\n33\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.234\nNo in the fact that we want to\nget our Windows updates and, but\n\n34\n00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:34.473\nyes in the fact that we might put\na priority on some updates over others.\n\n35\n00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:38.241\nBy getting those critical secure or\nsecurity related updates are gonna be more\n\n36\n00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.150\nimportant than maybe rolling out a service\nback that extends functionality.\n\n37\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.790\nSo, first let's define\nthe different classifications.\n\n38\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.483\nAnd let's take a look at my screen.\n\n39\n00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:49.307\nI actually browsed out to a Microsoft\nsite here, and description\n\n40\n00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:54.710\nof the standard terminology that is used\nto describe Microsoft software updates.\n\n41\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.496\nWhere better to get the information\nthan from Microsoft.\n\n42\n00:01:56.496 --> 00:02:00.470\nAnd we see here a critical update.\n\n43\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.846\nWidely released fix for\n\n44\n00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:06.820\na specific problem that addresses\na critical non-security related update.\n\n45\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.334\nThat's the key there.\n\n46\n00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.560\nYou think, critical, that's security.\n\n47\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.970\nIt's actually not.\n\n48\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.229\nIt's an important update,\na specific problem.\n\n49\n00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.580\nIt's a critical problem.\n\n50\n00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460\nBut it's not security related.\n\n51\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.000\nWe have a different classification for\nsecurity related updates.\n\n52\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330\nAnd that would be our\nsecurity updates all right.\n\n53\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.790\nWe also have definition updates.\n\n54\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.800\nBecause now we get our\nWindows definitions, or\n\n55\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.220\nsorry our Windows definitions,\nour Windows defender.\n\n56\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.670\nDefinitions through Windows update for\n\n57\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.310\nour anti malware suite that's built into\nMicrosoft operating systems nowadays.\n\n58\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.750\nWe've got service packs,\ntested cumulative set of all hot fixes,\n\n59\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.975\nsecurity updates, critical updates,\nand updates, right.\n\n60\n00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:50.803\nWhen they say it's accumulative,\nthat means as we go through time,\n\n61\n00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:55.102\nthey're releasing hot fixes and\ncritical updates, and security updates.\n\n62\n00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:58.582\nAnd then it comes to the point where they\nsay, you know what, we're gonna take\n\n63\n00:02:58.582 --> 00:03:02.303\neverything we released over the last few\nmonths, or however long of a time period.\n\n64\n00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:04.420\nAnd we're gonna roll it\nup in to a service pack.\n\n65\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.183\nAll right, and then you can get that one\nservice pack instead of getting hundreds\n\n66\n00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.745\nof individual updates, right?\n\n67\n00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:13.830\nSo if I go and\ninstall a fresh copy of Windows 10.\n\n68\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.000\nWell it's been out for a while.\n\n69\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.840\nOr I shouldn't use Windows 10.\n\n70\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.607\nI don't think there's a service pack yet\nfor it.\n\n71\n00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:20.080\nBut maybe for Windows 8, right?\n\n72\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.910\nThere's probably a service pack\nI can go get that would include\n\n73\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.540\nall the updates that have occurred\nover the past several months or\n\n74\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.520\nwhatever again that time period might be.\n\n75\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.460\nSo just service packs roll everything\nup into one convenient bundle.\n\n76\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.990\nAlthough service packs can\nalso include new features.\n\n77\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.260\nNot only can they update and\npatch existing features,\n\n78\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.440\ninclude all the hot fixes and\nupdates that have come out over time, but\n\n79\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.730\nthey can also actually\nintroduce new features.\n\n80\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.540\nOne that pops into mind is\nWindows XP Service Pack, was it three,\n\n81\n00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.610\nWes, that did the firewall?\n\n82\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.851\n&gt;&gt; I want to say that it was\nservice pack two, yeah a major,\n\n83\n00:03:55.851 --> 00:03:58.022\nmajor advancement in\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n84\n00:03:58.022 --> 00:04:01.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually a lot of\nthe functionality of Windows itself.\n\n85\n00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:02.386\nIt introduced a firewall.\n\n86\n00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:07.279\nIt might have been service pack three that\nintroduced IPv6 support with Windows XP.\n\n87\n00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.760\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you said that.\n\n88\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.510\nYou just brought Flash back.\n\n89\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.120\nI remember prior to\nservice pack two in XP,\n\n90\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.989\nhaving to install a firewall like zone\nalarm there, so talk about a flashback.\n\n91\n00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n92\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.605\nSo service packs not only roll\nup all the recent updates\n\n93\n00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:27.765\nthat have come out they can\nintroduce new features as well.\n\n94\n00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:31.604\nWhich then of course is going to actually\nturn into another round of updates later\n\n95\n00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.715\non for those new features, but\nhey that's just the way it works.\n\n96\n00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:39.413\nAnd there are some other ones,\nthey talk about tools, the utility,\n\n97\n00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:45.094\nyour feature, the completed task and\nupdate a widely released specific problem.\n\n98\n00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:49.110\nThey're not gonna quiz you on\nevery single classification.\n\n99\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.870\nI just wanted to point out that there\nare different classifications for\n\n100\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.030\nthese updates and\n\n101\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.120\nusually we really focus in on the security\nrelated updates and the critical updates.\n\n102\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.346\nThe other ones we might be a little\nslower to deploy all right?\n\n103\n00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:06.195\nAll right so that's our classification.\n\n104\n00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:10.292\nNow with Windows updates we'll\nprobably understand that our machines\n\n105\n00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:11.930\nare configured by default,\n\n106\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.448\nif we don't do anything to go out to\nMicrosoft servers every night at three am.\n\n107\n00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:18.405\nAnd look for updates.\n\n108\n00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:23.415\nIt reports in what operating system it's\nrunning and what updates it already has.\n\n109\n00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:26.655\nIt scans to see what updates\nare available based on the OS.\n\n110\n00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:30.280\nAnd possibly even applications you're\nrunning if you're getting updates for\n\n111\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.210\nOffice and Internet Explorer and\nthings like that.\n\n112\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.940\nAnd then the server reports back these\nupdates are available, and then depending\n\n113\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.410\non your settings on your machine it might\ndownload and install them automatically.\n\n114\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.790\nIt might just download them and\nthen you can go in and\n\n115\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.400\ninstall them whenever you need to.\n\n116\n00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.110\nOr it might just tell you that there's\nupdates available, but not download them.\n\n117\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.390\nAnd let you decide when to download them,\nand when to install them.\n\n118\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.250\nOr it might not check at all.\n\n119\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.530\nYou can configure your machine to not\ncheck for Windows updates at all right?\n\n120\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.640\nDefinitely not a good idea.\n\n121\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.980\nWe wanna get those updates.\n\n122\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.900\nThose updates are put out for a reason.\n\n123\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.170\nSomething is broke, or\n\n124\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.990\nsomething has been discovered that\nsomebody can take advantage of.\n\n125\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.380\nAnd possibly compromise your machine,\ngain access to your machine,\n\n126\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.180\ngain access to your information.\n\n127\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.069\nWe want those things applied.\n\n128\n00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.960\nWe really want them as\nsoon as we can all right?\n\n129\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.210\nSo on our home systems, and in small\ncorporate environments where we're not\n\n130\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.850\ncentrally managed you know just allowing\nthose machines individually go out to\n\n131\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.600\nMicrosoft and get those updates\nis probably just fine all right?\n\n132\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.770\nOr it is just fine and\n\n133\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.150\nwe should definitively make\nsure we're doing that but\n\n134\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.800\nwhen we get into a corporate environment,\nthe game changes just a little bit.\n\n135\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.550\nWhen we're dealing with many,\nmany clients, many, many servers.\n\n136\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.480\nYou know, most updates are tested,\nall updates, I should say,\n\n137\n00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.040\nare tested by Microsoft and\nthey're vetted.\n\n138\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.820\nThey're making sure that they're not\ngoing to cause any problems before\n\n139\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.930\nthey're released.\n\n140\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.520\nBut the truth of the matter is,\nis sometimes they still do,\n\n141\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.150\nand that's because Microsoft cannot test\nevery possible combination of hardware and\n\n142\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.110\nsoftware.\n\n143\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.432\nThat people might be running and\noccasionally an update comes out and\n\n144\n00:07:06.432 --> 00:07:09.924\nit causes a problem with a line of\nbusiness application that your company\n\n145\n00:07:09.924 --> 00:07:10.679\ncustom wrote.\n\n146\n00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:12.296\nOr had written for them or\n\n147\n00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:17.010\nsome combination of software just\ncauses a problem, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.340\nSo what we run into in\na corporate environment is I\n\n149\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.180\nneed to be a little more careful with\nmy application of these updates.\n\n150\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.790\nAnd what I mean is I really need\nto be able to test these updates\n\n151\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.370\nbefore I roll them out.\n\n152\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.780\nBecause what I don’t want to\nhappen is come in one morning and\n\n153\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.260\nfind out that 90% of the clients\non my network are blue streamed.\n\n154\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.380\nBecause some update came out last night,\ngot automatically installed and\n\n155\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.697\nis now causing a problem with some line\nof business application that we happen to\n\n156\n00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.257\nbe running.\n\n157\n00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:48.371\nAnd Microsoft's not able to test,\nand now we've got a problem.\n\n158\n00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:53.290\nAll of a sudden, we're scrambling to get\nthese back online, to get them fixed.\n\n159\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.609\nOr worse, our servers are having issues.\n\n160\n00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.316\nAnd nobody can connect to them because\nof some problem from an update.\n\n161\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:03.769\nSo ideally, we'd be able to test these\nupdates before we allow them to be\n\n162\n00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.839\ndeployed to the machines on our network,\nright?\n\n163\n00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:10.780\nAnd that's not to say that a small shop\ncan't do this as well, don't get me wrong.\n\n164\n00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.120\nBut in a small shop, I've only got three\ncomputers, little easier to deal with than\n\n165\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.860\nif I had thousands of computers that\nare going through this problem, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.810\nSo, what is the solution?\n\n167\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.990\nWell, it's called\nWindows Server Update Services, right?\n\n168\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.560\nIt's actually a role that I can\ninstall on a Windows Server\n\n169\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.420\nthat will allow me to do just that,\nto test updates and\n\n170\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.870\ncontrol the issuing or\nthe application of these updates.\n\n171\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.260\nThe best part is, is it's free, I mean,\n\n172\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.910\nyou've already bought your server license\nobviously, so that cost you some money.\n\n173\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.880\nBut this is just a role you're\ngonna install, just like DNS or\n\n174\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.410\nActive Directory, or DHCP.\n\n175\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.600\nAnd it's gonna give you complete\ncontrol over that update process.\n\n176\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.980\nFantastic, I don't know why anybody,\n\n177\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.020\nevery organization, honestly in my\nopinion, should be running WSUS.\n\n178\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.170\nThat's just one of those\nthings that we need to do.\n\n179\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.350\nAll right, so let's talk about the whole\nWindows Server Updates Services.\n\n180\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.150\nFirst thing I wanna do is\nkinda give you an overview\n\n181\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.630\nof really what it's doing,\nwhere it sits in our network.\n\n182\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.460\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand I've got a little diagram.\n\n183\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.030\nI'll try to zoom in\njust a little bit here.\n\n184\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.180\nWhere's zoom on this guy?\n\n185\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.350\nThere we go.\nI'll make that a little bit bigger, so\n\n186\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.900\nwe can see it.\n\n187\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.790\nSo, out in the internet,\nout there in Microsoft's networks,\n\n188\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.260\nthey've got their\nMicrosoft Update Servers.\n\n189\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.780\nAnd, what's gonna happen is\nwe're gonna set up our own,\n\n190\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.750\nwhat we call a WSUS server,\nWindows Server Update Services server.\n\n191\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.440\nWe install that role on there.\n\n192\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.660\nAnd that server is gonna\nreach out to Microsoft and\n\n193\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:51.170\ndownload the updates and store them\nlocally here on that WSUS server.\n\n194\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.660\nAnd then my clients are not\ngonna go talk to Microsoft.\n\n195\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.480\nThey're gonna talk to my server and\nthey're gonna get the updates from there.\n\n196\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.790\nAnd what this allows me\nto do is to kinda stop\n\n197\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.530\nthe process right here at the WSUS server,\nand I can choose to approve or\n\n198\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.950\nnot approve these updates for\nthe client machines back here.\n\n199\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.330\nSo I now have control over\nthe updates that are gonna\n\n200\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.420\nbe applied to the machines in my network.\n\n201\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.120\nThe other cool thing about WSUS\nis it allows me to create groups.\n\n202\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.360\nNow these are independent\nfrom Active Directory groups,\n\n203\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.030\nthey have nothing to do with my\nsecurity groups I would create there.\n\n204\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.390\nThese are groups that\nare only used within WSUS.\n\n205\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.130\nBut I can create a group of,\nlet's say, my test computers, right?\n\n206\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.590\nI can pick a few machines on my network,\ncall them my canaries,\n\n207\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.040\nmy little test group.\n\n208\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.380\nAnd when an update comes in,\nI can approve the update, but only for\n\n209\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.380\nthose five test computers.\n\n210\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.920\nLet those computers run for a day.\n\n211\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.410\nLet the users use their computers.\n\n212\n00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.910\nThey're gonna report in if they\nhave any problems or any issues.\n\n213\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.740\nAnd if they don't,\nI can then approve the update for\n\n214\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.330\nthe rest of the network, all right.\n\n215\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.920\nIf they do cause a problem,\nwell I've only got five machines.\n\n216\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.910\nWhatever was in that test group that\nI have a problem on, a little bit\n\n217\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.990\neasier to handle to fix, to figure out\nwhat the problem was, and maybe be able to\n\n218\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.590\nsolve it and be able to push that update\nout to the rest of the network, or\n\n219\n00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.530\ndecide that that update's not for us,\nits not a security related update.\n\n220\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.870\nIt causes a problem with\nour line of business app.\n\n221\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.540\nWe're just not gonna bother\napproving that update.\n\n222\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.070\nSo that's what WSUS is all\nabout is the ability to control\n\n223\n00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.460\nwhat updates are being\napplied in your network.\n\n224\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.490\nCuz normally,\nthese Windows machines go out at night and\n\n225\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.245\nthey just download automatically\nany update that Microsoft Server\n\n226\n00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:37.755\nsays is appropriate for\nthat particular operating system.\n\n227\n00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:41.435\nSo, let's look at how this process works.\n\n228\n00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:46.495\nI'm gonna show a WSUS server and\nwe'll take a look at this update process.\n\n229\n00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:50.025\nSo let me flip over to my server and\nthere we go.\n\n230\n00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:51.515\nWe can take a look at my screen.\n\n231\n00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:55.810\nI'm gonna open up the Windows\nServer Update Services console.\n\n232\n00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.650\nAnd I've already installed it and\nI've already done the initial\n\n233\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.780\nsynchronization because that\ncan take a little while.\n\n234\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.800\nYour server has to reach out to Microsoft\nand download these updates locally.\n\n235\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.750\nI say that, there are some\ndifferent options you can configure\n\n236\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.690\nas far as where the updates are stored and\nthings like that.\n\n237\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.240\nThe biggest thing you wanna do\nwhen you're setting up WSUS,\n\n238\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.660\nwhen you're initially setting it up\nis choose what updates you need.\n\n239\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.770\nYou do not wanna download every single\nupdate that Microsoft has ever made.\n\n240\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.880\nBecause I don't run any Windows 2000\nboxes, I don't need updates for\n\n241\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.320\nWindows 2000.\n\n242\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.540\nWe're not running Office'95\nanymore if there was an Office 95.\n\n243\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.390\nI don't need those updates.\n\n244\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.060\nI don't need updates in Chinese.\n\n245\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.480\nI don't need updates in Russian.\n\n246\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.280\nBecause all my companies are here\nin the States, for example.\n\n247\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.060\nOr maybe I've got some here and\nsome in, I don't know, France, so\n\n248\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.930\nI wanna get some of the updates in French\nand English, but that's all I need.\n\n249\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.332\nI don't need all the other languages.\n\n250\n00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:55.178\nThat's gonna limit the amount of updates\nthat I have to pull down and store.\n\n251\n00:12:55.178 --> 00:12:58.970\nSo when you first set it up, you get to\nchoose that, you can always go back and\n\n252\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.170\nchange it later and\nI'll show you that dialog box here.\n\n253\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.140\nI went to Options in my navigation tree,\nand then I clicked on Products and\n\n254\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.730\nClassifications, and\nwe'll let it build for a second, and\n\n255\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.330\nyou can see all of the different products.\n\n256\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.840\nReport viewer, Visual Studio, Exchange,\n\n257\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.340\nall the way back to Exchange 2000,\nForeFront.\n\n258\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.340\nWe go down here to, there's Lynx,\nSQL Server, Office all the way back\n\n259\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.330\nto Office 2002, Windows XP,\nSQL Server, System Center.\n\n260\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.260\nDown towards the bottom, there's\nWindows 10, Windows 8, Server 2003,\n\n261\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.360\nWindows XP, and\nthat's about as far back as it goes.\n\n262\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.523\nSo, you get to pick and choose what\nupdates you need in the first place.\n\n263\n00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:43.685\nLook at your environment.\n\n264\n00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:48.454\nWe're running 2008, 2012, 2016, those are\nthe only updates I really need to get, and\n\n265\n00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:52.683\nthen my client operating system, Windows\n7, Windows 8, Windows 10, for example.\n\n266\n00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:57.310\nThat's all I need, so you can pick and\nchoose what you need to update.\n\n267\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.258\nAnd again, it'll take that initial\nsynchronization, pulls those updates down\n\n268\n00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:04.357\nfrom Microsoft if you chose and\njust stores the updates locall.\n\n269\n00:14:04.357 --> 00:14:08.210\nNow, once those updates get downloaded,\nwe're synchronized with Microsoft.\n\n270\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.560\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nwe're gonna go and create groups.\n\n271\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.560\nGroups are what allow me to control,\n\n272\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.500\nbasically, who I'm going\nto approve the update for.\n\n273\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.810\nAnd I'm going to make\njust a couple of groups.\n\n274\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.500\nAgain, on this exam, they're not gonna\nhave you configuring a WSUS server.\n\n275\n00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.520\nSo I'm doing this more to\nshow you what's possible.\n\n276\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.680\nSo that if they ask you on the exam,\n\n277\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.080\nyou wanna be able to test updates before\nthey go out, what product would you use?\n\n278\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.670\nWindows Server Update Services\nwould be the answer, hopefully.\n\n279\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.256\nSo I'm just gonna create a group,\n\n280\n00:14:43.256 --> 00:14:48.605\nyou might have a group called create\nnew group, and I'll call it test,\n\n281\n00:14:48.605 --> 00:14:53.530\ncomputers And I'll click Add.\n\n282\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.790\nAnd just so we'll have something\nthat looks like a normal production\n\n283\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:02.710\nenvironment, I'll create another one and\ncall it my sales computers maybe and\n\n284\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:08.850\nanother one and\nI'll call it my marketing computers.\n\n285\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.790\nYou could create groups like\nbased on operating system.\n\n286\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.560\nYou gotta think about how you're\ngonna want to deploy these updates.\n\n287\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.060\nSo then, what would happen is,\nI would come in here on a daily basis, and\n\n288\n00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.090\nI would look at the updates that have\nbeen synchronized with Microsoft or\n\n289\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.140\npulled down, like let's see what they got\nlast night, see what updates are new.\n\n290\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.000\nI haven't touched any, this is like\na default install, just synchronized.\n\n291\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.250\nLet's go down to critical updates and\nI've got a few updates.\n\n292\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.510\nLet me change my status here so\nI can see some of them.\n\n293\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.210\nAll right, and so, here's a new update,\n\n294\n00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.160\nlet's pretend, let's say hey\na new updated came in last night.\n\n295\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.740\nWell, before I push out to the entire\nnetwork, I want to test it first.\n\n296\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.795\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna right click on that and\n\n297\n00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:57.901\nchoose Approve and I'm gonna approve\nit for just the test computers.\n\n298\n00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:03.409\nSo I hit that drop down list and choose\nApprove for install and I'll click OK.\n\n299\n00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:08.690\nSo only the computers that are in\nthat group are gonna get that update.\n\n300\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.944\nAnd then I'll let those computers run for\na little while,\n\n301\n00:16:10.944 --> 00:16:12.332\nsee if there's gonna be a problem.\n\n302\n00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:15.280\nNow while we're here, let's talk\nabout that, your test computers.\n\n303\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.690\nOne of the things, when virtualization\nbecame popular and became readily\n\n304\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:26.560\navailable, one of our things was to hey,\nwe'll make test computers virtual.\n\n305\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.470\nHow easy is that, right?\n\n306\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.470\nI'll just spin up three or four VMs,\n\n307\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.730\nuse them as my test environment,\nsee if the update causes any problems.\n\n308\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.890\nHere's what you've got to keep in mind.\n\n309\n00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.270\nYou need your test machines to\n\n310\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.310\nmimic as closely as possible your\nactual machines on your network.\n\n311\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.280\nIn other words,\n\n312\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.300\nthey should be running the same software\nthat your end users are running.\n\n313\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.820\nThey need to launch applications, right?\n\n314\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.080\nSo if I just approve the update for\na VM and\n\n315\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.390\nthe VM is just sitting\non my Hyper-V server.\n\n316\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.290\nIt's not running any of the same\napplications, I'm not really testing\n\n317\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.790\nhow this update is going to affect\nmy actual clients on my network.\n\n318\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.850\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n319\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.030\nWhen you're setting up your test machines,\n\n320\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.870\nit needs to be machines that are running\nthe same software and are being used.\n\n321\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.350\nNow whether you have people\nthat log into your VMs or\n\n322\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.510\nput them through their paces,\nokay, that's fine.\n\n323\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.300\nOr to actual machines that\nare being used in your environment.\n\n324\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.235\nThat's fine too.\n\n325\n00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:21.395\n&gt;&gt; Now you mentioned software,\nI was saying,\n\n326\n00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:23.935\nI would be thinking,hardware,\nit is just a hardware level.\n\n327\n00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:27.355\nCould that be cause problem too if\nI got it in a virtual machine, it's\n\n328\n00:17:27.355 --> 00:17:31.730\ngenerally gonna pick up whatever hardware\nis on the host operating or host machine.\n\n329\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.670\nIf I'm running multiple different\nhardware types, you might not be getting,\n\n330\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.460\ncomparing apples to apples on this one.\n\n331\n00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right.\n\n332\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.850\nThere was a big issue when\nVista first came rolling out.\n\n333\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.770\nAnd people would get\nsome of those upgrades.\n\n334\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.830\nAnd come in the next day and\nnothing is working.\n\n335\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.280\nYou can't print, you can't do anything.\n\n336\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.860\nAnd that's because there\nwere some driver issues and\n\n337\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.000\nUAC issues that caused some problems,\nright?\n\n338\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.520\nSo hardware would definitely be something.\n\n339\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.280\nYou might wanna, in your test group,\n\n340\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.370\ninclude one of those Dell laptops and\none of those HP towers.\n\n341\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.090\nAnd one of those ThinkPads, right,\nto get you a representation\n\n342\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.760\nof the different devices that\nare being run on your network.\n\n343\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.409\nAbsolutely, great point there, Wes.\n\n344\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.970\nAs we approve the update for\nthe test computers and\n\n345\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.580\nthen once that had been tested and\nit's not causing a problem.\n\n346\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.800\nI can go back and\nI can do it a couple different ways,\n\n347\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.620\nI can say you know what tonight,\nlet me go ahead and approve her for sales.\n\n348\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.560\nOr I could just approve it for\nthe entire network,\n\n349\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.785\nI can just go to all computers and\nI could have proved it that way.\n\n350\n00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:33.290\nIf I'll go back and right-click on\nthat update, the same update and\n\n351\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.630\nnow it's been tested\non the test computers.\n\n352\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.260\nSo do I wanna do just marketing or\nmaybe I wanna go ahead and\n\n353\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.690\nroll it out to all computers.\n\n354\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.020\nMaybe I wanna stagger the deployment or\nmaybe I want to approve it for\n\n355\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.290\neverybody at once.\n\n356\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.940\nAnd now what will happen is when they\ncheck in, that update has been approved,\n\n357\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.430\nso their computer will download it and\ninstall it, right?\n\n358\n00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.350\nIf it's not approved, they won't download,\nthey won't install it,\n\n359\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.070\nthey won't see it as an update.\n\n360\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.670\nSo this is the power of WSUS,\n\n361\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.280\nI get the control what updates are going\nout to the systems, all right?\n\n362\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.430\nNow there are ways you can set\nup some automatic approval, but\n\n363\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.280\nyou cannot defeat the purpose\nif you do that, right?\n\n364\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.460\nThe whole reason I'm doing this is to\nhave the ability to test the updates\n\n365\n00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.060\nbefore they go out to my enterprise or\nto my network.\n\n366\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.708\nIf I'm just gonna automatically approve\nthem and not have me come in here and\n\n367\n00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:22.589\ntest them first and then approve them.\n\n368\n00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:25.910\nI might just let them go to Microsoft and\ndownload them, right?\n\n369\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.920\nIt kind of does defeat the purpose,\nall right.\n\n370\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.600\nLet's see,\nwhat else we wanna know about WSUS.\n\n371\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.860\nOther than that,\nI think the one thing I will [INAUDIBLE],\n\n372\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.330\nthere's a lot more we could do in here.\n\n373\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.170\nBut [INAUDIBLE], that's where along when\nyou're starting to get your system admin\n\n374\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.920\ncertification.\n\n375\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.370\nAs long as we understand\nwhat this product is,\n\n376\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.960\nwhat it allows me to do,\nwhat the advantage are.\n\n377\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.990\nBeing able to test those updates,\nthose side benefit is the fact that say,\n\n378\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.600\nI've got 1,000 nodes on my network.\n\n379\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.510\nEvery night, they're going and\nall reaching out to Microsoft and\n\n380\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.480\nthey're all downloading\nthe same update 1,000 times.\n\n381\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.000\nBy running WSUS, only going out once,\n\n382\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.710\ndownloading it,\nbringing it to the local area network.\n\n383\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.370\nAnd then all my machines are pulling\nit from my local WSUS server\n\n384\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.820\nstaying on that local network.\n\n385\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.180\nA little side benefit there.\n\n386\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.270\nAll right, so the other thing I wanna show\nyou is the group policy settings that\n\n387\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.150\nare associated with WSUS.\n\n388\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.940\nBecause setting up WSUS, creating\nthese groups in here is one thing.\n\n389\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.010\nBut then how do I tell my machines, how do\nthey know not to go out to Microsoft and\n\n390\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.570\nget updates but\nto get them from my local WSUS server?\n\n391\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.810\nWell, we're gonna us a group policy for\nthat, right?\n\n392\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.300\nWe learned about group\npolicies previous episode.\n\n393\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.660\nA way that I can deploy a configuration to\nmultiple machines or users on my network.\n\n394\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.430\nSo let's flip over to my\ndomain controller here.\n\n395\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.140\nAnd I'm gonna open up that group\npolicy management console.\n\n396\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.520\nAnd we'll just take\na look at the settings.\n\n397\n00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.790\nI'll go ahead and make a blank policy.\n\n398\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.212\nI'll call it my WSUS settings.\n\n399\n00:21:02.907 --> 00:21:05.273\nAnd then we'll edit that policy.\n\n400\n00:21:05.273 --> 00:21:09.430\nAnd we'll take a look at what we've got.\n\n401\n00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.850\nIf we go underneath\nComputer Configuration and then Policies.\n\n402\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.180\nAnd then Windows Settings.\n\n403\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.040\nAnd then Security Settings.\n\n404\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.150\nAnd then Windows Components.\n\n405\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.950\nDid I do that wrong?\n\n406\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.820\nI did that wrong.\n\n407\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.550\nI lied to you, guys.\n\n408\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.540\nThey are not on Windows settings.\n\n409\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.630\nThey are in Administrative Templates.\n\n410\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.700\nAnd then Windows Components.\n\n411\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.690\nSo I'm gonna do that again,\nComputer Configuration, Policies,\n\n412\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.960\nAdministrative Templates,\nWindows Components.\n\n413\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.420\nAnd then all the way\ndown towards the bottom,\n\n414\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.093\nwe're gonna find our\nWindows Update settings.\n\n415\n00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:43.730\nAnd there's a lot of settings.\n\n416\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:48.570\nBut there's only really a few that we\nneed to configure to make WSUS work.\n\n417\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.435\nThe first one is\nConfigure Automatic Updates, all right.\n\n418\n00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:57.417\nI want to make sure that my nodes or\nmy network are configured to actually\n\n419\n00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:02.170\ngo out and get updates automatically\nwhatever timeframe I choose.\n\n420\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.940\nCuz my users,\nif they're admins on the local machine,\n\n421\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.500\nthey might try to turn\noff the Windows Updates.\n\n422\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.600\nOne thing I didn't mention when we talked\nabout group policy in a previous episode\n\n423\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.480\nthat I wanna make sure we're aware of.\n\n424\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.050\nWhen you configure a setting\nthrough group policy and\n\n425\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.870\nyou apply that, you deploy that setting\nout to the notes on your network.\n\n426\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.540\nThat locks that setting down, so\nthe end users cannot undo it.\n\n427\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.400\nWhen you use group policy to configure\na change on the end user station,\n\n428\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.100\nthat setting in gonna be grayed out.\n\n429\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.210\nFor example, if I set the screen saver\nto be ten minutes using a group policy,\n\n430\n00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.230\nthey couldn't go change that.\n\n431\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.620\nIt would be grayed out on their system.\n\n432\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.500\nThey'd get the little message that says\nsome of your settings are configured by\n\n433\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.450\nyour system administrator.\n\n434\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.020\nPlease see your system admin.\n\n435\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.050\nI heard something like that,\nwhich is a great thing.\n\n436\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.960\nI spend all this time configuring, getting\nthe settings that comply to my security\n\n437\n00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.260\npolicy, that keep us in compliance\nwith HIPAA, whatever the case may be.\n\n438\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.330\nI don't want my end user to\nbe able to undo all that.\n\n439\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.580\nSo when you configure settings through\ngroup policy, it locks the user interface.\n\n440\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.860\nEven an admin can't change that setting.\n\n441\n00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.807\nThe only way to change it is to come\nback through group policy and change it,\n\n442\n00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:11.450\nall right?\n\n443\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.960\nSo it's fantastic,\nwe do love that as administrators.\n\n444\n00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.824\nBut anyway, so\nI'm going to turn on updates and\n\n445\n00:23:16.824 --> 00:23:21.490\nI'll just do automatically download and\ninstall and I'll click OK.\n\n446\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.360\nSo all that's doing is making sure\nthat my clients and my servers for\n\n447\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.260\nthat matter if I apply this to them,\n\n448\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.860\nare gonna be automatically getting\ntheir updates every night at 3 AM.\n\n449\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.480\nThen we're gonna double-click on Specify,\n\n450\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.530\nif I can say that, Intranet\nMicrosoft Update Service Location.\n\n451\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.330\nI'll double-click on that, right?\n\n452\n00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.710\nAnd I'm gonna enable it.\n\n453\n00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.740\nI'm choosing Enable.\n\n454\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.070\nI know that's small,\nlet me zoom in for just a second.\n\n455\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.380\nI'm gonna enable it.\n\n456\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.620\nAnd then I got two options there.\n\n457\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.160\nSet the intranet update service for\ndetecting updates.\n\n458\n00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.920\nSet the intranet statistic service.\n\n459\n00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.740\nThis is all HTTP based or\n\n460\n00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:02.784\nHTTPS depending on whether you've set it\nup to use secure socket layers or SSL.\n\n461\n00:24:02.784 --> 00:24:07.568\nSo on my WSUS server there is actually\na web interface that these clients end up\n\n462\n00:24:07.568 --> 00:24:08.608\nconnecting to.\n\n463\n00:24:08.608 --> 00:24:12.388\nSo you're gonna give them the URL for\nyour Update server.\n\n464\n00:24:12.388 --> 00:24:13.805\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n465\n00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:18.143\nAnd in my case, that's gonna be\n\n466\n00:24:18.143 --> 00:24:24.094\nhttp://svro1.lab.itpro.tv: and\n\n467\n00:24:24.094 --> 00:24:26.995\nyou know what, Wes?\n\n468\n00:24:26.995 --> 00:24:29.335\nI forgot my default port number.\n\n469\n00:24:29.335 --> 00:24:34.347\nSo let's go back and\ncheck my options here on that one.\n\n470\n00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:40.217\n[SOUND] And\nlet's check my configuration wizard.\n\n471\n00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:44.171\nAnd remember what my default\nport number is 8530.\n\n472\n00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:46.342\nBrain cramp there for a second.\n\n473\n00:24:46.342 --> 00:24:48.391\nSomething you can definitely change.\n\n474\n00:24:48.391 --> 00:24:54.144\nBut the default port number is 8530 for\nWSUS, so 8530.\n\n475\n00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:56.200\nThe difference between these two,\n\n476\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.290\nthe first one is what machine\ndo I go to get my updates?\n\n477\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.100\nTo check to see if there's updates and\npull them down if there are.\n\n478\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.450\nThe second one is,\nwho do I report back to just say hey,\n\n479\n00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.030\nthese are the updates I've got.\n\n480\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.000\nThese are the updates I don't have.\n\n481\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.330\nI successfully installed this one,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n482\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.920\nI have one server, so\nthey're both gonna be the same URL.\n\n483\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.009\nYou might have it in a large environment,\nWSUS servers at each branch office,\n\n484\n00:25:22.009 --> 00:25:25.790\nso they can pull the updates\nfrom a local WSUS server.\n\n485\n00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.678\nBut you might want them all reporting back\nto a central one in your corporate office,\n\n486\n00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:33.074\nso you can run reports every morning\nto see how many nodes successfully got\n\n487\n00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:34.918\ntheir updates, and things like that.\n\n488\n00:25:34.918 --> 00:25:36.976\nI'll do\n\n489\n00:25:36.976 --> 00:25:46.980\nsvro1.lab.itpro.tv:8530.\n\n490\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.800\nAnd then I'll go ahead and\nclick OK, all right?\n\n491\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.200\nSo we've got two configured so far.\n\n492\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.410\nOne, turning on automatic updates.\n\n493\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.410\nTwo, telling them where\nthe local update server is.\n\n494\n00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.983\nAnd then the third one,\n\n495\n00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:08.065\nif I can find it here,\n[SOUND] where is it?\n\n496\n00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:12.220\nYou might or might not use is enable\nclient side targeting, right?\n\n497\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.970\nRemember I said we created the groups\nlike test and sales and marketing.\n\n498\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.040\nWell, how do my computers\nknow what group they're in?\n\n499\n00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.735\nThere's two ways you can do this.\n\n500\n00:26:21.735 --> 00:26:24.475\nYou can do it in the WSUS console.\n\n501\n00:26:24.475 --> 00:26:29.443\nWhen the computer first reports in,\nand he knows how to do that because of\n\n502\n00:26:29.443 --> 00:26:33.630\nthat setting we just configured,\nHTTP svro1:8530.\n\n503\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.690\nIt's gonna show up under what's called un,\n\n504\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:41.170\nlet's just look at that there,\nunassigned computers, right?\n\n505\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.420\nWhen we look at these groups, there's\na group called Unassigned Computers.\n\n506\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.890\nAll computers start there,\n\n507\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.136\nand then what would happen is I would see\nthem listed out here in the details area.\n\n508\n00:26:50.136 --> 00:26:52.821\nI'd right-click on one,\nchoose Add to Group, and\n\n509\n00:26:52.821 --> 00:26:56.372\nI could move it to the test\ncomputer's group, for example, right.\n\n510\n00:26:56.372 --> 00:26:58.690\nSo that's a very manual process.\n\n511\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.890\nThe other way to do it is to\nuse client side targeting.\n\n512\n00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:08.240\nWe can actually create a policy that says,\nif this policy applies to you,\n\n513\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.550\nI wanna put you in the test\ncomputer's group, all right?\n\n514\n00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.660\nAnd I could click OK.\n\n515\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.570\nSo now when this policy applies,\nthey'll automatically,\n\n516\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.130\nwhen they go reporting into WSUS, they'll\nsay, by the way, I'm in the test group.\n\n517\n00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.940\nAnd it'll put them in\nthe appropriate group.\n\n518\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.130\nSo a little more automated process there\nof assigning those machines to the groups.\n\n519\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.470\nNow in my case, if you're paying\nattention, don't write into my forums.\n\n520\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.290\nI know that I link this to\nthe domain itself and so\n\n521\n00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.660\nevery machine in my network is now\ngonna be part of the test group.\n\n522\n00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.550\nThat would not be a good scenario, okay.\n\n523\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.630\nI just wanted to show you\nthat configuration option.\n\n524\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.700\nYou would make individual policies.\n\n525\n00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.760\nYou would go to the OU that contain the\nsales computers and you'd make a policy\n\n526\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.360\nthere, turn on updates, tell them\nwhere their update server was, and\n\n527\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.220\nput them in that sales group\nusing client side targeting.\n\n528\n00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.120\nThen you go to the marketing OU and\nyou do the same thing.\n\n529\n00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.200\nMake a policy that told them to\nturn on their automatic updates,\n\n530\n00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.290\nwhere to go to get them, and\nput them in the marketing area.\n\n531\n00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.640\nYou'd have several policies to assign\n\n532\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.040\nthese computers to the different\ngroups within WSUS.\n\n533\n00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.660\nBut those are the three policies\nyou need to be familiar with.\n\n534\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.658\nThere are others as you can\nsee here that you might or\n\n535\n00:28:17.658 --> 00:28:22.121\nmight not use in your environment, but\nthose are the big three that we need to\n\n536\n00:28:22.121 --> 00:28:25.229\nuse to configure\nWindows Server Updates Services.\n\n537\n00:28:25.229 --> 00:28:30.729\nNow Wes, I swore there was one more thing\nthat I wanted to say about WSUS but\n\n538\n00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:34.930\nI can't think of it now so\nI must of covered it all.\n\n539\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.406\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we call that sometimers,\nsometimes I remember,\n\n540\n00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:38.705\nsometimes I forget for sure.\n\n541\n00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:40.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that's a lot of great information\n\n542\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.910\nwhen it comes to updates and\njust patch management in general,\n\n543\n00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.297\nmaking sure that your computers are up and\nrunning smoothly.\n\n544\n00:28:45.297 --> 00:28:48.163\nAnd making sure that they don't have\nany security vulnerabilities in them.\n\n545\n00:28:48.163 --> 00:28:52.265\nSo definitely take Mike's advice,\nkeep those machines patched.\n\n546\n00:28:52.265 --> 00:28:56.047\nNow Mike it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode, but\n\n547\n00:28:56.047 --> 00:28:58.975\nbefore we do, do you have any\nadditional advice you might\n\n548\n00:28:58.975 --> 00:29:02.097\nlike to give on just the overall\nWindows update experience?\n\n549\n00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:05.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just the importance\nof getting the updates.\n\n550\n00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:06.884\nYou hear stories and people say,\n\n551\n00:29:06.884 --> 00:29:10.740\nwell your computer will run better if\nyou actually don't go get updates.\n\n552\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.350\nDon't believe that hooey.\n\n553\n00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.490\nMake sure you're getting your updates,\nat least the critical and\n\n554\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.012\nthe security related updates.\n\n555\n00:29:17.012 --> 00:29:18.740\nThe feature updates and\nthings like that, okay, yeah,\n\n556\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.800\nyou might be able to put that off.\n\n557\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.780\nBut those security updates, I mean,\nwhen they've put out a security update,\n\n558\n00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.135\nthat's because they have found a flaw.\n\n559\n00:29:25.135 --> 00:29:29.670\nSomebody, either the companies they pay\nto test their products and report back to\n\n560\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.460\nthem, or they've found a serious\nproblem that could lead to compromise.\n\n561\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.820\nAnd you don't want to be running around,\nthat's like running around vulnerable\n\n562\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.370\nto chicken pox when there's a vaccine I\ncan go get to protect me from chicken pox.\n\n563\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.180\nI mean, why would you do that, right?\n\n564\n00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.090\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n565\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:51.660\nWhy would you run around vulnerable to\nsome buffer overflow attack, when it would\n\n566\n00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.940\ntake one update, and you would no\nlonger be vulnerable to that attack?\n\n567\n00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.175\nSo, get your updates.\n\n568\n00:29:56.175 --> 00:29:58.879\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, Mike Rodrick,\n\n569\n00:29:58.879 --> 00:30:03.160\nthe urban Windows update urban\nlegend debunker, for sure.\n\n570\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.150\nWell, Mike, that's a great\nplace to go ahead and wrap up.\n\n571\n00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.390\nWe do appreciate you being in the studio\nwith us and we appreciate you,\n\n572\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.240\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n573\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.380\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n574\n00:30:13.380 -->

00:00:08.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:11.997\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:14.755\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:16.141\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.250\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our GIACGSEC Security Essentials.\n\n8\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.800\nAnd joining me back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.340\nthis very endeavor is none\nother than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.290\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.685\nAnd yep,\nwe are continuing on with our GIACGSEC.\n\n13\n00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:34.160\nAgain this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at Windows.\n\n14\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.640\nAnd in particular,\nwe're gonna be looking at backup and\n\n15\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.320\nrestore, talk a little bit about that.\n\n16\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.570\nObviously important stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.240\nWe're gonna need to make sure\nthat we're taking good backups,\n\n18\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.230\nunderstand what our backups are, and\nthat we can restore those backups, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.540\nIt's all about disaster recovery and\npreventing or\n\n20\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.740\nbeing able to recover in\nthe event of some type of failure.\n\n21\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.120\nSo let's start with talking about backup.\n\n22\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.167\nAnd in general we should understand\nthe concept of backing up our data,\n\n23\n00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:07.995\nespecially our critical data.\n\n24\n00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.319\nThis is something that\nan organization has to go through and\n\n25\n00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:16.250\ndetermine what type of backup strategy we\nneed to use for different sets of data.\n\n26\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.280\nTypically involves data classification,\nwhich we talk about in another episode\n\n27\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.730\nbecause some data I need\nto back up once in a while.\n\n28\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.883\nIf it's archived data, for example, if\nit's data that we use to generate reports,\n\n29\n00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:32.833\nlast year's sales, the year before sales,\nbefore that sales.\n\n30\n00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:36.827\nThat kind of information obviously very\nimportant that we keep, we maintain, but\n\n31\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:38.630\nit's not changing.\n\n32\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.800\nSo as long as I've got a backup of it,\nI don't need to take one everyday,\n\n33\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.750\nbecause the backup I take today is\ngonna be exactly the same as the backup\n\n34\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.420\nI took yesterday, which is exactly\nthe same as the backup I took last week.\n\n35\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.770\nRight, so if it's not changing a lot,\nwe don't need to back up as frequently.\n\n36\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.400\nWe just need to make sure we've got a good\nbackup, and that it's stored properly.\n\n37\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.030\nTypically two copies,\none on site, one off site,\n\n38\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.900\nin the event of a disaster of some kind,\nfire, hurricane, things like that.\n\n39\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.428\nRight, so but other data,\ndata that does change frequently,\n\n40\n00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:13.034\nI need to back up more often.\n\n41\n00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:14.117\nBecause it changes and\n\n42\n00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:17.548\nso I need to make sure I've got the most\ncurrent version in that backup.\n\n43\n00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:19.913\nI don't wanna roll that\nbackup if something happens.\n\n44\n00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:23.950\nI go back and restore my backup and\nthe backup's three months old.\n\n45\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.490\nWell, that information is dated or missing\nthree months' worth of changes that have\n\n46\n00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.360\noccurred to that data, it's probably\nnot gonna do us a whole lot of good.\n\n47\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.072\nIt's better than nothing, but\nit's not a very good scenario to be in.\n\n48\n00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:41.030\nIn fact, we've joked around, I know\nwe've got a couple stories around here.\n\n49\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.290\nNot of anybody here but just in general.\n\n50\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.344\nThat's what can end up\nbeing what we call a RGE.\n\n51\n00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:49.910\nYou remember that acronym, right?\n\n52\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.390\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat's the resume generating event.\n\n53\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.950\nAnd I've also heard that if the whole\nnetwork fails, if you've got\n\n54\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.218\none printer that works, at least you can\nprint your resume on the way out the door.\n\n55\n00:02:58.218 --> 00:02:59.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n56\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.972\nSo you don't wanna be that guy or gal that\nwhen they say we had a failure, let's go\n\n57\n00:03:03.972 --> 00:03:08.756\nget our backups, let's do our restore, and\nyou don't have all your backups, right?\n\n58\n00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.700\nYou didn't back everything up.\n\n59\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.150\nOr the backups you do have aren't\nrestoring properly because\n\n60\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.830\nthere's something corrupt in them.\n\n61\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.960\nOr your backups are three months old and\nthat's the most current backup you have.\n\n62\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.900\nNot a good place to be.\n\n63\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nwhen it comes to backups in general,\n\n64\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.870\nwould you say that this is a part\nof ongoing system maintenance and\n\n65\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.082\nit really shouldn't be like\na reactive type maintenance.\n\n66\n00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:32.270\nYou're saying everything fails,\n\n67\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.820\nwe're scrambling to find out\nwhere's our backup media.\n\n68\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.980\nBut this really should be,\n\n69\n00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.100\nwould you say in your opinion,\npart of an ongoing system maintenance?\n\n70\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.070\nWhether it's daily, whatever your backup\nschedule is, but just do your backups.\n\n71\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.684\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it has to be planned out.\n\n72\n00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:49.560\nWe have to think about what we need to do,\nwhere we're gonna store it,\n\n73\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.860\nhow often we're gonna back it up,\nthings like that.\n\n74\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.520\nHow many backups are we gonna keep?\n\n75\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.812\nIf I back it up today do I\nstill need yesterday's backup?\n\n76\n00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:56.470\nOr do I need last month's backup?\n\n77\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.310\nOr do I need last year's backup?\n\n78\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.938\nHow are we doing this?\nThere's different methods.\n\n79\n00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:05.791\nI know we talk about in,\nI can't remember if it's A+ or NetPlus.\n\n80\n00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:06.390\nWhat is it?\n\n81\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.100\nThe father,\nthe grandfather methodology, or-\n\n82\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n83\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.650\nThat's the tape rotation method.\n\n84\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.990\nThat doesn't really define what\nwe're putting on the media.\n\n85\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.170\nBut a better systematic approach to\n\n86\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.040\nreduce the complexities behind\nmanaging that media, absolutely.\n\n87\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.430\nWhat is it, grandfather, father's son?\n\n88\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.520\nAnd then the other one,\nwhich is a crazy method for\n\n89\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.460\nlarger enterprise environments\nlike the Tower of Hanoi.\n\n90\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have studied that one.\n\n91\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.671\nAnd I'm like, [NOISE] it took me a few\ntimes of reading that to figure out\n\n92\n00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:38.727\nexactly what was going on.\n\n93\n00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:42.270\nBut you're guaranteeing that you're\nrotating through your media.\n\n94\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.760\nNot reusing the same tape over and\n\n95\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.530\nover and a different set\nof tapes never gets reused.\n\n96\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.770\nSo this one wears out faster,\nit's just a good method to have.\n\n97\n00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.845\nAnd on this exam, they're not asking us\nfor specifics on tape rotation methods or\n\n98\n00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:55.916\nanything like that.\n\n99\n00:04:55.916 --> 00:04:57.816\nBut I just wanted to throw it out there,\n\n100\n00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:01.227\nsomething that we should consider\nas we're thinking about backups.\n\n101\n00:05:01.227 --> 00:05:05.401\nThe other set of terms I wanna mention\nhere is gonna be full backups versus\n\n102\n00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:09.445\nincremental backups versus\ndifferential backups, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:12.405\nAnd a full backup, we always have\nto start with a full backup.\n\n104\n00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:14.435\nBecause that backs up everything.\n\n105\n00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.475\nWell, whatever it is you're\nchoosing to back up.\n\n106\n00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:20.065\nIt backs up all of the bits\nthat make up that data set.\n\n107\n00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:23.890\nThat's a full backup, and\nwe always wanna start with that.\n\n108\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.710\nOnce we've got a full backup,\nthen we can choose to intersperse either\n\n109\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.170\ndifferential or incremental backups\nwith that full backup rotation or both.\n\n110\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.233\nWe can do incrementals and differentials.\n\n111\n00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:41.800\nAnd let's see if I can remember, and\nWes will be the one to correct me on this,\n\n112\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.380\ndifferential does not include wait,\ndoes not.\n\n113\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.720\nDifferential does not.\n\n114\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.616\nSo a differential backup,\nif I get this right, Wes,\n\n115\n00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:54.607\ndoes not include the changes since the,\nyeah, no.\n\n116\n00:05:54.607 --> 00:05:55.292\nI've got this mixed up.\n\n117\n00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:56.807\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna help you on this one.\n\n118\n00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.903\nEverything revolves\naround the archive bit.\n\n119\n00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:03.272\nWe talk about a full backup, just Mike's\nalready laid that one out, right?\n\n120\n00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:06.676\n[CROSSTALK] It's okay, I just seen\nthe light bulb moment goes off and\n\n121\n00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:10.033\nwe're gonna hand this one back over\nto Mike and let him explain it.\n\n122\n00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:10.562\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n123\n00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:13.566\nI'm gonna let Wes do it, but I just\nremembered my little saying that I used\n\n124\n00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:15.953\nto remember this which obviously\ndoesn't work too well.\n\n125\n00:06:15.953 --> 00:06:19.323\nThe differential does not\nclear the archive bit.\n\n126\n00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:20.561\nThat's what I was trying to remember.\n\n127\n00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:23.755\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nyou start with your full backup, right?\n\n128\n00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:26.611\nSo you backup everything and\nthen the differential backup,\n\n129\n00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:28.184\nit looks back to the full backup.\n\n130\n00:06:28.184 --> 00:06:32.593\nAnd it says okay, currently,\nwhat if I had that's changed.\n\n131\n00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:34.040\nI'm gonna go ahead and back that up.\n\n132\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.340\nBut what it doesn't do is, it doesn't\nmark any of those files as backed up.\n\n133\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.640\nSo the next day happens and it says, okay,\n\n134\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.340\nwhat's changed since the last\nfull backup was done?\n\n135\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.510\nAnd it finds even more\ndata the second day.\n\n136\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.740\nAnd then finally the incremental backup,\nit says, you know what,\n\n137\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.090\nI'm gonna backup everything that's changed\nsince the last time a full backup was run.\n\n138\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.796\nAnd then the next day all\nof those bits are clear,\n\n139\n00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:57.850\nall of those archive bits are clear.\n\n140\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.900\nSo it's not gonna see any archive bits.\n\n141\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.874\nSo it's basically just doing a day-to-day\nbackup of what's changed since the first\n\n142\n00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:06.790\ntime the last backup is changed.\n\n143\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.589\nOne of the things that I think about when\nyou think about backups is how is how fast\n\n144\n00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:12.245\ndoes it take to restore your data?\n\n145\n00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:15.100\nCuz we always, and I don't know if\nyou wanna get into restoration now.\n\n146\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.790\nBut that's just one of\nthe things that I consider.\n\n147\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.866\nOkay, so\nif you're gonna do a full backup and\n\n148\n00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:22.630\nevery day you're gonna backup everything,\nyou might say, well, wait a second.\n\n149\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.950\nThat takes a long time to back that up.\n\n150\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.580\nAnd the answer would be true.\n\n151\n00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.118\nBut I don't have a lot of stuff to\nfind when I need to restore my data.\n\n152\n00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Success.\n&gt;&gt; Differential's a little bit different\n\n153\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.190\nbecause it's the midway point between\n\n154\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.130\nhow long it takes to back data up versus\nhow long it takes to restore data.\n\n155\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.360\nAnd then the incremental is the other\nside, the farthest side of the tracks.\n\n156\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.510\nIt says, I can back your data up very,\nvery quickly.\n\n157\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.530\nBut you're gonna need all your tapes for\nthe prior week leading up to that failure,\n\n158\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.380\nincluding the full backups, so\nthe restoration time takes the longest.\n\n159\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nI couldn't have said it any better myself.\n\n160\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.520\nThere we go.\n\n161\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.135\nSo yeah, and\nlet's just reiterate that one more time.\n\n162\n00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:59.002\nSo full backup backs up everything.\n\n163\n00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:01.906\nAnd let's say I do a full\nbackup on Sunday night, right?\n\n164\n00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:06.301\nAnd then Monday, If I choose to do,\nlet's say we're doing differentials,\n\n165\n00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:09.614\nthen Monday's backup,\nif it's a differential backup,\n\n166\n00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.850\nall the changes have occurred\nsince that full backup on Sunday.\n\n167\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.500\nIf I do another differential on Tuesday,\n\n168\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.550\nall those changes since\nthe full backup on Sunday.\n\n169\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.400\nSo Monday's backup has\nall of Monday's changes,\n\n170\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.490\nTuesday's backup has all of Monday's\nchanges and Tuesday's changes.\n\n171\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.290\nWednesday's backup then, would have all of\nthe changes all the way back to the full,\n\n172\n00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.820\nso it would have Monday's,\nTuesday's and Wednesday's changes.\n\n173\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.640\nSo with the differential each\nnight it's taking longer and\n\n174\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.680\nlonger to complete the backup, right?\n\n175\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.650\nBut, if something fails,\nthen Thursday we've got do a restore,\n\n176\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.990\nthe only thing restoring is the full back\nup from Sunday, and the last differential.\n\n177\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.260\nCuz remember the differential went all\nthe way back to the full back ups.\n\n178\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.200\nSo I don't need Mondays and Tuesdays,\nI needs Sundays full, and Mondays.\n\n179\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.705\nI mean sorry, Wednesdays differential.\n\n180\n00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:04.130\nAnd then, as Wes said very clearly,\nincrementals do clear the archive a bit.\n\n181\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.120\nSo when they go back and\n\n182\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.820\nlook at the data, they're only getting\nbasically that days changes, right?\n\n183\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.425\nSunday's a full backup,\nMonday's incremental backup just\n\n184\n00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:17.310\ngets the changes on Monday, and\nthen clears all the archive bits.\n\n185\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.810\nSo Tuesday's backup only\ngets Tuesday's changes.\n\n186\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.360\nIt doesn't know about Monday's changes\nbecause those archive bits were cleared.\n\n187\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.890\nWednesday's only includes, Wednesday's\nchanges, Thursday there's a failure so\n\n188\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.030\nthe incremental as far as speed every\nnight depending on how busy the day was,\n\n189\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.940\nhow many changes were that day but\n\n190\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.970\nit's just that one days changes\nif you're doing them once a day.\n\n191\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.006\nBut when I go to restore,\nI need Sunday's full backup,\n\n192\n00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:45.100\nthen I need to apply Mondays incremental\nbackup because that's Mondays changes.\n\n193\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.600\nThen I've got to apply Tuesday's\nincremental, then Wednesday's incremental.\n\n194\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.074\nAnd I have to do them in that order right,\nfull then Mondays,\n\n195\n00:09:51.074 --> 00:09:52.740\nthen Tuesdays then Wednesdays.\n\n196\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.560\nSo a lot more work involved\nin the restoration process.\n\n197\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.950\nBut incrementals were\na lot quicker to get done\n\n198\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.600\nduring the middle of night and\nthe back up.\n\n199\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, in fact that was\nthe point I was gonna make.\n\n200\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.160\nI heard somebody make that, I was reading\nsome article, studying up myself and\n\n201\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.240\nthat's exactly what they said.\n\n202\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.148\nConsider your downtime.\n\n203\n00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.700\nIf you're a company that's an online\ne-commerce, we've been talking about\n\n204\n00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.540\ncertificates and PKIs so\nyou guys should be familiar with that.\n\n205\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.110\nIf not, go back and watch that episode,\n\n206\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.970\nbut E-commerce,\nI mean it happens 24/7, right?\n\n207\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.700\nAround the world so there's not a lot of\ndown time with you data so it might not be\n\n208\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.330\nfeasible to have a full back up on that\nkind of, when there is no downtime.\n\n209\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.830\nBut if you're one of those companies,\nmaybe you, in a perfect world,\n\n210\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.800\nyou go home at 5 o' clock or\nyou come back to work at 9.\n\n211\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.920\nSo if there's a good expanse of\ntime when your data's just at rest,\n\n212\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.370\nmaybe the full back-up is for you.\n\n213\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n214\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.090\nWhy not do a full back-up every night?\n\n215\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.450\nI mean, that would be ideal.\n\n216\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.050\nThen I'd just have that\none back-up to restore.\n\n217\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.870\nBut as Wes said there's times when\nyou cannot get a full back-up done.\n\n218\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.980\nI've worked in organizations\nwhere those back-ups\n\n219\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.350\nwere started once the business day ended,\nwrapped things up,\n\n220\n00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.420\nmake sure everything is done,\n8 o'clock, back-up start.\n\n221\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.420\nThey're barely finished\nbacking everything up.\n\n222\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.640\nBy the time the business day\nis starting the next day.\n\n223\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.880\nThere's just so\n\n224\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.170\nmuch data that has to be backed up\nthat I can't get it done in one night.\n\n225\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.148\nSo that's when the full\nbackup just won't work.\n\n226\n00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:11.430\nWe've got to now come up\nwith a better plan and\n\n227\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.980\nchoose to do incrementals, or\nback up certain sets of data on Monday,\n\n228\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.890\ndifferent sets of data on Tuesday,\nand things like that.\n\n229\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.030\nSo there's a lot of strategy involved in\nbacking up and it's really just making\n\n230\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:27.810\nsure that we're getting the right\ninformation backed up, and backing it up.\n\n231\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.970\nTerm based on how important the data is,\n\n232\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.380\nhow easy it is to recover or\nreplace, right?\n\n233\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.280\nIf it's data that if I lose it,\nI'm going to simply fill it in again like\n\n234\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.970\nan employee phone list, I mean it's\neasy to get that information again.\n\n235\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.140\nSo it's really not a huge\ndeal if I back it up.\n\n236\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.120\nSales orders though,\nhow do I put those back?\n\n237\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.130\nI can't figure out,\nI've got to call customers.\n\n238\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.770\nHey, what did you order yesterday?\n\n239\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.418\nYeah, that's not gonna be good.\n\n240\n00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:55.900\nAll right, so that kind information\nis very hard to replace I\n\n241\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.870\nneed to make sure I can get back up so.\n\n242\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.950\n&gt;&gt; I asked you that question as far as\nit's going to be is this going to be\n\n243\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.468\nan ongoing daily system maintenance\nbringing it back into the security level.\n\n244\n00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:08.500\nIn fact, Mike you were kind of pervy to\nthis we were watching I mean what is it\n\n245\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.210\ntoday, today is December 14th 2016 and\nI've just\n\n246\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.410\ndiscovered another one of those ransomware\nattacks where it encrypts all your data.\n\n247\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.730\nWell if I don't have the current back ups\nof my data, and it encrypts my data, and\n\n248\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.420\nI don't have access to those keys\nlike you told us in other episodes,\n\n249\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.360\nI lose access to all my information.\n\n250\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.095\nSo I can see where backups are critical in\na situation like that, where ransomware,\n\n251\n00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:32.175\nsomebody gets it,\nit encrypts that information.\n\n252\n00:12:32.175 --> 00:12:34.115\nAnd now yeah, I've got my data.\n\n253\n00:12:34.115 --> 00:12:36.045\nBut well, I can't read it anymore.\n\n254\n00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:38.075\n&gt;&gt; You're almost forced to\npay the ransom at that point,\n\n255\n00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:40.335\nbecause your backups are too old.\n\n256\n00:12:40.335 --> 00:12:43.015\nOtherwise you could just tell them hey,\nkeep the encrypted data.\n\n257\n00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:45.155\nI don't care.\nWe'll wipe the systems and restore backup.\n\n258\n00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:46.975\nAnd we're not gonna pay the ransom.\n\n259\n00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.035\nBut if my backups are a week old, and\n\n260\n00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.675\nI can't replace that data,\nIt's not gonna help me.\n\n261\n00:12:52.675 --> 00:12:55.700\nI'm going to have to\nprobably pay that ransom.\n\n262\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.740\nAnother thing I want to talk about\nwith backups as far as just general\n\n263\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.856\nconcepts and terms is storage.\n\n264\n00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:03.930\nWe want to make sure that we\n\n265\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.300\nare keeping multiple copies typically of\nthese backups, we want a backup close by.\n\n266\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.260\nSo if something happens,\nI can get that backup and\n\n267\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.100\nI can start that restore process.\n\n268\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.637\nBut I've got to make sure that I also keep\nanother copy of that backup typically\n\n269\n00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:21.055\noff-site somewhere.\n\n270\n00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:25.860\nBecause if I take my back up tapes,\nor whatever medium I'm using to do my\n\n271\n00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.270\nbackups, we use tapes just\nas a thought process.\n\n272\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.090\nTypically, we're not using tape anymore.\n\n273\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.260\nBut let's say I take my backup media.\n\n274\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.820\nI make my backup on my server.\n\n275\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.950\nAnd then take the media and\nI just put it on top of the server rack.\n\n276\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.520\nOkay, great.\n\n277\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.910\nIt's there right when I need it until I\nhave a fire in the server closet, right?\n\n278\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.040\nNow I've lost my servers and my backups.\n\n279\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.530\nNot going to do me any good.\n\n280\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.570\nSo you've got to make sure you're\nkeeping those backups safe.\n\n281\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.940\nI've got a story about\na small organization\n\n282\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.400\nthat I had the privy of dealing with,\nand we were talking about backups, and\n\n283\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.220\nwe were talking about off-site backups and\nmaking sure.\n\n284\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.570\nAnd they were, yeah,\nwe do offsite backups.\n\n285\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.630\nWe keep a copy.\n\n286\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.030\nI was like, where do you guys keep yours?\n\n287\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.340\nIs it how far from your office?\n\n288\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.750\nIs there another office\nsomewhere in another state?\n\n289\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.340\nWhat do you guys do online?\n\n290\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.980\nThere's a lot of online\nservices that you can use.\n\n291\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.070\nLike no,\nwe put the back up tapes in her trunk.\n\n292\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.930\nAnd they pointed to one of the coworkers\nbecause she lives the farthest\n\n293\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.590\nfrom the office.\n\n294\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.380\nSo if we figure if anything happens,\nit'll be safe in her trunk.\n\n295\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.770\nYeah, not a good idea, right.\n\n296\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.360\nSo we really wanna think\nthrough our decisions there.\n\n297\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm trying not to,\n[LAUGH], off camera and laugh.\n\n298\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.020\nBut I mean, it really isn't funny.\n\n299\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.510\nBut that's bad decisions.\n\n300\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.270\nMike, you mentioned the term off site.\n\n301\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.100\nAnd so I can only say that in contrast,\nyou have on site and off site.\n\n302\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.030\nCan you tell us a little\nbit more about those terms?\n\n303\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\non site just means I'm keeping it local.\n\n304\n00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.850\nLike it might be on a network server.\n\n305\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.340\nSo I've got all my servers in a rack.\n\n306\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.797\nI've got a storage space,\nJBOD or a San and\n\n307\n00:14:51.797 --> 00:14:55.070\nI'm backing it up to that local device.\n\n308\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.450\nSo that would be our on-site storage,\nright is right there if I need it.\n\n309\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.390\nI can do a restore process if\nI have a hard drive failure,\n\n310\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.380\ncorruption of an operating\nsystem I can simply restore it.\n\n311\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.440\nAnd then off-site would be somewhere else.\n\n312\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.410\nSomewhere physically\nlocated somewhere else.\n\n313\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.915\nWhether that's another one of\nmy offices across the country or\n\n314\n00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:18.497\nin another country or\nwith some online provider.\n\n315\n00:15:18.497 --> 00:15:23.232\nAgain, that's a very common method now for\nyour off-sites, it's just simply to,\n\n316\n00:15:23.232 --> 00:15:25.554\nto back it up to a cloud service provider.\n\n317\n00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:27.660\nVery, very common today.\n\n318\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.250\nWhere else was I gonna go with that?\n\n319\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.660\nIt could be that you have an arrangement,\nwith one organization,\n\n320\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.840\nthat had an arrangement.\n\n321\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.220\nHey look, we'll back our stuff up\nacross the network to your servers,\n\n322\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.530\nyou back your stuff up across\nthe network to our servers.\n\n323\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.440\nWe're on different sides of town and\nthat was our offsite solution.\n\n324\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.612\nWe were kinda swapped space, if you will.\n\n325\n00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:49.522\nSo if something happened to their\nmachines in their server closet,\n\n326\n00:15:49.522 --> 00:15:53.159\nsomebody broke in and stole everything out\nof there, they get those new servers in.\n\n327\n00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:55.635\nWe've got a copy of the backups\nthey can use to do that restore.\n\n328\n00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:58.718\nSo that's what I mean by offsite.\n\n329\n00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:03.670\nAll right, the other thing I wanna mention\nabout backups is security, all right?\n\n330\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.380\nYou have to treat those backups as\nyou would the actual machines and\n\n331\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.490\nthe actual data.\n\n332\n00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.955\nBecause it is the actual data\nthat resides on those machines.\n\n333\n00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:16.975\nI don't wanna back up my system and\nthen put it somewhere that anybody\n\n334\n00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.985\ncan get access to because they\ncan try to take that backup and\n\n335\n00:16:19.985 --> 00:16:23.585\nrestore it on another physical machine,\nand gain access to the information.\n\n336\n00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:28.707\nOr try to restore it to a virtual machine,\nand try to, if I've got a backup\n\n337\n00:16:28.707 --> 00:16:32.917\non my domain controller, and I give Wes\nthat backup, or he gets access to that,\n\n338\n00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:36.387\nhe could take it to a VM, do a restore and\nthen have all day to hack on it.\n\n339\n00:16:36.387 --> 00:16:39.330\nAll month to hack on it\nwithout triggering any alarms,\n\n340\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.050\nlogging any information about\nhim attacking my system,\n\n341\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.400\nbecause he's doing it offline with\na backup copy of my information.\n\n342\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.240\nSo the backups have to be treated\nsecurely, that means setting access\n\n343\n00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.630\ncontrol lists on those backups, the files\nthemselves, that means securing the media.\n\n344\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.530\nAll right,\nI'm not gonna put it in my desk roar.\n\n345\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.010\nI wanna make sure it's locked\nup in the server closet or\n\n346\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.500\nwherever which using the store,\nand server classes typically had\n\n347\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.030\nanother layer of security, most\nemployees can get in the front door, but\n\n348\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.180\nvery few employees have a key they\nget some in the server closet.\n\n349\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.830\nSo, that's staying in there,\nit's a good secure location,\n\n350\n00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.410\nI've got a secure network access, so\nthat means access control list, and\n\n351\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.790\nthen off site, I gotta trust the people\nthat we're doing the offsite.\n\n352\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.570\nIf you're doing Cloud Service Provider you\ngot SLA's, you've got agreements in place.\n\n353\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.400\nIf you're with a partner business\nlike I was saying earlier and\n\n354\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.680\nkind of trading spaces there,\nmake sure you trust those people\n\n355\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.511\nbecause now you're backups are in their\nhands and as good as their security is.\n\n356\n00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:40.650\nAll right, so let's talk about\nbacking up within Windows.\n\n357\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.580\nThere are lots of choices when\nit comes to backup software,\n\n358\n00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.260\nlots of third party tools.\n\n359\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.090\nAnd honestly,\nthose are probably more common\n\n360\n00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.140\nthan the Windows Server backup we're\ngetting ready to talk about here.\n\n361\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.510\nBut Windows Server Backup is a feature\n\n362\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.360\nthat I can install in my\nserver operating system.\n\n363\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.760\nSo it's built into it.\n\n364\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.190\nAnd it doesn't cost me any additional\nmoney, above and beyond the license, for\n\n365\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.880\nmy server operating system.\n\n366\n00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.680\nIt's definitely got the jokes about it,\nand all of that.\n\n367\n00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.300\nBut really Windows Server Backup\nis a great backup utility.\n\n368\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.024\nIt's just not an enterprise\nlevel back up utility.\n\n369\n00:18:17.024 --> 00:18:21.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike, I find myself sometimes\ntoo just making the little jokes,\n\n370\n00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:23.640\nI'm guilty as charged here.\n\n371\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.910\nBut one of the things I have to credit\nMicrosoft with is we don't have to go to\n\n372\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.500\na third party cuz the software can get\nvery, and I know you're aware of this,\n\n373\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.370\ncan get very expensive,\nthousands of dollars really quick.\n\n374\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.670\nIt's nice to have something on-board and\nbuilt in,\n\n375\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.030\neven if it isn't let's say the Lamborghini\nor the Ferrari of the back up software.\n\n376\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n377\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:46.240\nThe only really problem that most\npeople have with Windows Server Backup\n\n378\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.860\nis the lack of an enterprise feature,\nright?\n\n379\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.080\nIt's a very one machine type thing.\n\n380\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.140\nYou've got to install Windows Server\nBackup on everyone of your servers.\n\n381\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.940\nYou can create some scheduled tasks, and\n\n382\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.560\nyou can push out jobs to try to\nautomate a little bit of it.\n\n383\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.520\nBut it really is just for\nthat one machine.\n\n384\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.050\nWhereas you get something\nlike backup exec or\n\n385\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:12.320\nsome of these other third party utilities\nwhere there is an enterprise console and\n\n386\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.230\nthere's a way to manage it\nall from a central location.\n\n387\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.440\nMaybe a little bit easier\nin larger environments.\n\n388\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.880\nBut even in those environments,\n\n389\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.580\nwe'll still see people using\nWindows Server Backup.\n\n390\n00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.320\nBecause there are things that I can do\nwith that that are quick and easy for\n\n391\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.370\nthat one quick backup.\n\n392\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.712\nI'm getting ready to make\na major change to the server.\n\n393\n00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.900\nI wanna make sure I\nhave a fall back point.\n\n394\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.390\nI'll do a quick backup,\nand run the server backup.\n\n395\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.520\nI can do my change to that server.\n\n396\n00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.520\nIf it fails, I can restore that\nbackup that I made ten minutes ago.\n\n397\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.320\nSo it's really nice and\ncurrent, it's right there.\n\n398\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.580\nSo we'll use it for that reason, just for\ntesting purposes on some of my servers.\n\n399\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.290\nProbably not in the production\nenvironment when we're doing that.\n\n400\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.490\nI've used it on servers here at ITPro.\n\n401\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.910\nI've got some servers that I don't really\nneed a backup of the entire server.\n\n402\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.420\nI can rebuild that server\nin a matter of an hour.\n\n403\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.903\nSo it's no big deal if\nsomething happens to it, but\n\n404\n00:20:07.903 --> 00:20:13.255\nthere is a little bit of data on there\nthat I need that's not as easy to replace.\n\n405\n00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:16.920\nBut rather than back up the entire\nserver and the 128 gig hard drive,\n\n406\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.260\nI just use Windows Server Backup to backup\nthose select files to a network location,\n\n407\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.590\nto another server that I\nalready take a full backup of.\n\n408\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.090\nSo now, I'm just moving those few files\nusing Windows Server Backup to this other\n\n409\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.900\nserver, and\n\n410\n00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.620\nthen my third party utility that backs up\nthat server, gets that information, right?\n\n411\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.720\nSo we kinda combine it with\nsome of that other software.\n\n412\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.584\nSo, lots of uses for\nWindows Server Backup.\n\n413\n00:20:37.584 --> 00:20:42.060\nOne of the things we need to know about\nit, is that it's not installed by default.\n\n414\n00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.750\nIf you take a look at my screen here, I've\ngot my good old domain controller, and\n\n415\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.150\nI go Tools, and then Window Server Backup.\n\n416\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.862\nMike lied to us, it's right there.\n\n417\n00:20:50.862 --> 00:20:53.070\nWell hey,\nlet's see what happens when I click on it.\n\n418\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.630\nI come in here and I'm going to, there it\nis right there, Windows Server Backup,\n\n419\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.860\nlet me see if I can zoom in for you.\n\n420\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.200\nNope I can't just yet on this VM.\n\n421\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.508\nBut it says Windows Server Backup\nis not installed.\n\n422\n00:21:06.508 --> 00:21:11.790\nTo install it, go to server manager and do\nthe whole add rolls and features routine.\n\n423\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.725\n&gt;&gt; I think I can get\na hold of Microsoft and\n\n424\n00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:17.175\ncall that false advertisement\nespecially something that's so serious.\n\n425\n00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:17.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n426\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.485\n[LAUGH] Yes, so let's go and install.\n\n427\n00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:23.785\nLet me close out Windows Server Backup,\neven though it's not actually installed.\n\n428\n00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:26.105\nThe consoles there,\nthe service is not on there.\n\n429\n00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:30.725\nSo all I did was went to my dashboard and\nserver manager, and\n\n430\n00:21:30.725 --> 00:21:32.980\nwe'll click next a couple of times.\n\n431\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.060\nAnd this is a feature not a role.\n\n432\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.669\nSo we go skip the roles screen.\n\n433\n00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.080\nWe go to features.\n\n434\n00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.559\nI'll scroll down and way down here towards\nthe bottom, there's Windows Server Backup.\n\n435\n00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:44.940\nI'll click next and install.\n\n436\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.420\nIt doesn't require reboot for this\nparticular install, so we'll let that go.\n\n437\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.736\nLet it run for a second.\n\n438\n00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:51.398\nIt's relatively easy.\n\n439\n00:21:51.398 --> 00:21:55.062\nAgain, you can script this out if you\nwanted to install it across multiple\n\n440\n00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:58.770\nmachines or what have you, and\nit doesn't take all that long.\n\n441\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.030\nOnce that's installed,\nthen we can open up that console again,\n\n442\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.960\nand want take a look at some of the\noptions we have for setting up a backup.\n\n443\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.550\nWhile we're waiting for it to install,\nwell, it's almost done.\n\n444\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.890\nWe'll save it here cuz I wanna show you\nsome of the different options that we\n\n445\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.210\ncan do during the back up.\n\n446\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.470\nYou would need a location to back up to.\n\n447\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.210\nI went ahead and\nadded a second hard drive to this machine.\n\n448\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.010\nI'll close that wizard, it's done.\n\n449\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.780\nWe'll go to tools and\nthen Windows Server Backup.\n\n450\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.510\nAnd we don't have that scary little\nmessage, we should be good to go.\n\n451\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.130\nSo I'm gonna click on Local Backup.\n\n452\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.086\nAnd let me break out my\nzoom tool here real quick,\n\n453\n00:22:42.172 --> 00:22:47.684\nSo that you guys can see what\nI'm doing on this machine.\n\n454\n00:22:47.684 --> 00:22:50.511\nSo we should be able to\nzoom in now there we go.\n\n455\n00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:55.320\nGreat little utility from Microsoft,\nif you've got a need to display like I'm\n\n456\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.939\ndoing here, call zoom it, that gives\nme that ability to zoom in real quick.\n\n457\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.380\nAll right, so Windows Server Backup.\n\n458\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.110\nI've selected local backup.\n\n459\n00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.100\nAnd you'll see up here, it says no backup\nhas been configured for this computer.\n\n460\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.180\nUse the schedule wizard or\nthe backup once.\n\n461\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.260\nSo if we take a look over here,\nI've got the options for backup schedule,\n\n462\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.820\nbackup once, and recover, and\nthen configure performance settings.\n\n463\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.779\nSo let's take a look,\nbackup schedule is just that.\n\n464\n00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:26.051\nIf I wanna set up a schedule,\n\n465\n00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:29.982\nwell hey this thing's back up every night\nat 1:00 AM and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n466\n00:23:29.982 --> 00:23:34.020\nBackup once just for what I need you\nto do that one off backup, hey I need\n\n467\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.882\na quick back up before I roll out, I don't\nknow .net25, whatever's coming up in\n\n468\n00:23:38.882 --> 00:23:43.090\nthe future before I do that I wanna\nmake sure I've got a good backup of it.\n\n469\n00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.750\nSo, you can use either\none of those options.\n\n470\n00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.134\nLet's go ahead and check the schedule out.\n\n471\n00:23:48.134 --> 00:23:50.313\nI'll click backup schedule.\n\n472\n00:23:50.313 --> 00:23:54.262\nI'll click next on my wizard and\nwe're gping to have a full server backup,\n\n473\n00:23:54.262 --> 00:23:57.584\nI probably won't actually run\nthis It's a little tiny VM, but\n\n474\n00:23:57.584 --> 00:23:59.234\nstill could take a little bit.\n\n475\n00:23:59.234 --> 00:24:02.420\nYou can see, it's 11 gigs in size, why?\n\n476\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.120\nI don't have any data on this server.\n\n477\n00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.120\nActive Directory has like\nthree accounts in it.\n\n478\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.230\nSo, why am I doing 11 gigs?\n\n479\n00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.200\nThis is a full server backup, right?\n\n480\n00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.510\nIt's gonna get everything.\n\n481\n00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.252\nThis is what I need in the event\nI have to do a full restore.\n\n482\n00:24:16.252 --> 00:24:17.611\nSo I'll click Next.\n\n483\n00:24:17.611 --> 00:24:21.860\nAnd then I can do once a day,\nand I can pick my time.\n\n484\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.995\nOr I can do more than once a day,\nand I can select multiple times.\n\n485\n00:24:24.995 --> 00:24:28.337\nWe'll go ahead and set this for\nsome time around 10 o'clock at night.\n\n486\n00:24:28.337 --> 00:24:30.090\nI'll click Next.\n\n487\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.583\nAnd then where do I wanna back this up to?\n\n488\n00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:34.196\nAnd let's zoom in to this real quick.\n\n489\n00:24:34.196 --> 00:24:37.100\nBackup to hard disk that is dedicated for\nbackups.\n\n490\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.677\nThat is the recommended method,\n\n491\n00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:41.561\none of the reason I added a second\nhard drive to this machine.\n\n492\n00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:47.513\nDo notice what it says there, the hard\ndisk that you use will be formatted and\n\n493\n00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:50.950\nthen dedicated to only store backups.\n\n494\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.101\nThat means that disk can't be used for\nanything else,\n\n495\n00:24:53.101 --> 00:24:56.061\nyou're not gonna be able to create\nfolders on there, store data on there.\n\n496\n00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:59.684\nAnd if there is any data on there\ncurrently, it will be lost.\n\n497\n00:24:59.684 --> 00:25:02.006\nOkay, so make sure you pay\nattention to that option.\n\n498\n00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:04.117\nYou can back up to a volume.\n\n499\n00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:07.921\nIf I don't have an entire physical\ndisk that I can dedicate to this,\n\n500\n00:25:07.921 --> 00:25:11.618\nI could partition that up and\nI could choose to back up to a volume.\n\n501\n00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:18.090\nAnd it would allow me to actually\nshare that volume with other data.\n\n502\n00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.750\nOr you can back up to a network share.\n\n503\n00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.049\nThis is a relatively new one.\n\n504\n00:25:23.049 --> 00:25:26.051\nPin me down to a date,\nI wanna say 2008 introduced this but\n\n505\n00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:27.392\nI'm not positive on that.\n\n506\n00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:30.990\nBut backing up to a shared network folder.\n\n507\n00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.970\nGreat I could put this across the network.\n\n508\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:33.920\nDidn't used to be able to do that.\n\n509\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.740\nIt had to be a locally attached storage.\n\n510\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.397\nThere is a caveat though with\nbacking up to the network.\n\n511\n00:25:39.397 --> 00:25:43.830\nAll right, the one that you need to\nunderstand, and that it does tell me here.\n\n512\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.210\nNote that you will only\nhave one backup at a time\n\n513\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.770\nbecause when you create a new backup\nit overwrites the previous backup.\n\n514\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.520\nNow, so what that means is I will\nonly have the latest backup up there.\n\n515\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.610\nYou think, well, that's great, right?\n\n516\n00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.215\nWell it depends, what if you want to go to\na backup from three days ago you're trying\n\n517\n00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:03.104\nto figure out when.\n\n518\n00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:06.343\nYou know something was deleted somebody's\ncome to you and said hey this is gone.\n\n519\n00:26:06.343 --> 00:26:09.558\nWe need to go to a backup to\nget it back when was a deleted\n\n520\n00:26:09.558 --> 00:26:12.488\nyeah I don't know well hopefully,\nlet's see,\n\n521\n00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:16.140\nif I go to the network to do my\nbackups I've only got one copy.\n\n522\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.580\nSo I better hope that it was\ndeleted really recently.\n\n523\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.296\nI guess if it was deleted two days ago,\nmy backup probably doesn't have that file.\n\n524\n00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:26.826\nWhereas if I was backing up to a volume or\na dedicated drive,\n\n525\n00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:29.311\nI could have back ups that span over time.\n\n526\n00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:32.601\nAnd I could go back to last week's\nback up and last month's back up,\n\n527\n00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:36.269\ntry to figure out when we still had\nthat information before it got deleted.\n\n528\n00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:40.995\n&gt;&gt; And that does seem a little scary\nif it's gonna erase the prior backup.\n\n529\n00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:43.695\nWhat happens if they have\na network transmission failure?\n\n530\n00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:48.131\nHas it already started to erase that\nfirst backup when you're 100 gigs into\n\n531\n00:26:48.131 --> 00:26:49.551\nthe backup and it fails.\n\n532\n00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:52.119\nI mean so that I guess that will\nbe something that you really have\n\n533\n00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:54.404\nto consider, dedicated links or\nsomething like that.\n\n534\n00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's definitely\nsomething you wanna think about.\n\n535\n00:26:56.528 --> 00:27:00.660\nIt's one of the reasons we didn't have\nthat option back in the days because of\n\n536\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.916\nthe risk of losing network\nconnectivity during the back up.\n\n537\n00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:05.983\nAll right, let me zoom back out.\n\n538\n00:27:05.983 --> 00:27:09.687\nAnd I'll go ahead and say back up to\na hard disk that is dedicated for backups.\n\n539\n00:27:09.687 --> 00:27:16.807\nI'll click Next, and it's going to, no\nexternal disks or [INAUDIBLE] were found.\n\n540\n00:27:16.807 --> 00:27:20.788\nLet's see we could choose this one,\nthough.\n\n541\n00:27:20.788 --> 00:27:24.750\nWe'll do that one, so I just browse,\nshow all available disks.\n\n542\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.580\nIt was looking for an external drive,\nI've got an internal drive there.\n\n543\n00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.750\nI click next and\nit tells me that was a unit included,\n\n544\n00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.350\nvolume D,\non the list of items be backed up?\n\n545\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.800\nDid I, I didn't choose you to backup.\n\n546\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.380\nBecause they do a full backup,\n\n547\n00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.750\nit's backing up everything it\nsees including the D drive.\n\n548\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.664\nAnd now I'm telling it to store the backup\non the D drive, so it's really not happy\n\n549\n00:27:48.664 --> 00:27:51.861\nabout that, which is something that\nwe should be aware of as well.\n\n550\n00:27:51.861 --> 00:27:55.300\nI don't want to store the backup\non the drive that I'm backing up.\n\n551\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.350\nOne, that wouldn't do me any good.\n\n552\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.320\nIf I lose that drive I lost the back up.\n\n553\n00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.330\nSo most of them won't let you.\n\n554\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.048\nBut I can choose, do you want to\nremove this volume from the back up?\n\n555\n00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:06.290\nThere's nothing on that drive.\n\n556\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.430\nI put that drive in there specifically,\nfor back ups.\n\n557\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.500\nSo, yeah, sure, don't back that drive up.\n\n558\n00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.018\nUse it as a place to store the back up.\n\n559\n00:28:13.018 --> 00:28:19.689\nAnd then, it tells me it's gonna\nreformat and all that I'll say yes.\n\n560\n00:28:19.689 --> 00:28:23.240\nAnd then it's gonna back up again.\n\n561\n00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.120\nDoing a full metal, full server backup.\n\n562\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.850\nIt's gonna do bare metal recovery.\n\n563\n00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:33.170\nIf a system partition,\nlocal disk recovery, and system state.\n\n564\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.730\nNow let's talk about these\noptions here real quick.\n\n565\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.415\nCuz I don't want to actually do\nthis backup just take too long.\n\n566\n00:28:39.415 --> 00:28:42.615\nBut a bare metal recovery, what is that?\n\n567\n00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:47.428\nThat I'm backing up everything,\nif I need to be able to, let's say I\n\n568\n00:28:47.428 --> 00:28:52.033\nlose a hard drive, or I lose the physical\nserver, I rebuild that server.\n\n569\n00:28:52.033 --> 00:28:57.000\nIt's got no OS, blank hard drives are put\nback in there, this is what I would use\n\n570\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.210\na bare metal recovery is includes the\noperating system, everything, all right?\n\n571\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.050\nIf a system partition that's that\nhidden partition on our drive,\n\n572\n00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.730\nsometimes has vendor information\nin there for recovering for\n\n573\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.345\ndoing system restore on a system.\n\n574\n00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:20.493\nThe local disk C obviously is where\nmy operating system is installed that\n\n575\n00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:22.126\nrecovery partition again.\n\n576\n00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:23.846\nAnother one of those hidden partitions.\n\n577\n00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:26.831\nI think it's about a 150 megs, or\n140 megs, or something like that.\n\n578\n00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:29.440\nAnd then system state, right?\n\n579\n00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.720\nNow system state is the configuration\nof the operating system.\n\n580\n00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.770\nIf I do a bare metal recovery and\nI don't have the system state, or\n\n581\n00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.010\nif I reinstall an operating system,\nlet's say I don't have this.\n\n582\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.150\nI don't have a backup.\n\n583\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.130\nAnd I've lost that server.\n\n584\n00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.090\nI've gotta reinstall the operating system.\n\n585\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.170\nBut now it's a clean install, right.\n\n586\n00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.384\nNone of my configuration is there.\n\n587\n00:29:50.384 --> 00:29:53.600\nSo I've gotta go back and\ndo all that reconfiguration.\n\n588\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.865\nIf I backup the system state,\nthat includes that configuration.\n\n589\n00:29:56.865 --> 00:30:01.910\nSo not only can I get the OS back, but\nI can get my configuration back as well.\n\n590\n00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.140\nWe do need to understand what is\nincluded in a system state back up.\n\n591\n00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.701\nThat's a great test question.\n\n592\n00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:10.115\nLet me make sure I get them all,\nwe got the boot files are in there.\n\n593\n00:30:10.115 --> 00:30:16.310\nYour system registry settings, your system\nprotective files active directory data.\n\n594\n00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.930\nIf it's a domain controller,\n\n595\n00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.980\nyour system state will include\nthe active directory database.\n\n596\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.008\nIf it's a domain controller, that's where\nthe information that gets replicated\n\n597\n00:30:26.008 --> 00:30:27.706\nbetween your domain\ncontrollers are stored.\n\n598\n00:30:27.706 --> 00:30:30.265\nYour group policy information\nget's stored there.\n\n599\n00:30:30.265 --> 00:30:34.120\nThat would be included if\nit was a domain controller.\n\n600\n00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.915\nYour com-plus component\nregistration services or\n\n601\n00:30:36.915 --> 00:30:40.412\ncomponent services database would\nbe included in system state.\n\n602\n00:30:40.412 --> 00:30:42.963\nAs well as the certificate\nservices database,\n\n603\n00:30:42.963 --> 00:30:45.890\nif you have certificate\nservices installed.\n\n604\n00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.390\nWe talked about that\nin a previous episode.\n\n605\n00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:51.037\nThat's where all the information\nabout the certificates that have been\n\n606\n00:30:51.037 --> 00:30:55.295\nissued by that certificate authority,\nwhen they expire, who they were issued to.\n\n607\n00:30:55.295 --> 00:30:58.560\nVerification information,\nthings like that.\n\n608\n00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.020\nSo if I back up the system state,\n\n609\n00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.842\nit would include the certificate\nservices database as well.\n\n610\n00:31:02.842 --> 00:31:05.740\nIIS metadata is actually also included.\n\n611\n00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.485\nNot on my list, I don't know how I\nmissed that one, but I remembered, so\n\n612\n00:31:08.485 --> 00:31:09.299\nyou guys are in luck.\n\n613\n00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:11.134\nBut your IIS metadata.\n\n614\n00:31:11.134 --> 00:31:14.942\nNow not all your websites It's not\nyour actual web pages typically\n\n615\n00:31:14.942 --> 00:31:20.230\nunless they happen to be located on one of\nthe drives that you're backing up already.\n\n616\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.101\nBut IIS metadata configuration for IIS,\n\n617\n00:31:23.101 --> 00:31:26.305\nthe sites that are there and\nthings like that.\n\n618\n00:31:26.305 --> 00:31:29.008\nAnd if it happens to be a web server, so\n\n619\n00:31:29.008 --> 00:31:33.573\nI'll go ahead and click finish\nIt's gonna format that drive and\n\n620\n00:31:33.573 --> 00:31:38.790\nit won't actually do the backup\nuntil 10 o'clock tonight.\n\n621\n00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.286\nSo that is backing it up but\nWes is giving me that evil eye again.\n\n622\n00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:44.600\nSo I'll tell you what,\n\n623\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.164\nwhy don't we talk about restore\nafter Wes let's me talk again.\n\n624\n00:31:48.164 --> 00:31:49.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's right.\n\n625\n00:31:49.382 --> 00:31:53.214\nBecause we coming to the end of another\nepisode but we have more to go.\n\n626\n00:31:53.214 --> 00:31:57.110\nVery important concept,keep in mind that\nnot only are we talking about system\n\n627\n00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.427\nmaintenance here but\nwe are also talking about security, right.\n\n628\n00:32:00.427 --> 00:32:04.704\nCuz as Mike talked about in other\nepisodes we talked about confidentiality,\n\n629\n00:32:04.704 --> 00:32:06.564\nwe've talked about integrity.\n\n630\n00:32:06.564 --> 00:32:07.219\nWe've taught,\n\n631\n00:32:07.219 --> 00:32:09.849\nshowed you some of the things you\ncan use whether it be encryption.\n\n632\n00:32:09.849 --> 00:32:14.060\nWhether it be things like your hash values\nto make sure that messages haven't changed\n\n633\n00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.467\nwhen we've received them.\n\n634\n00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:19.041\nBut, one of the other ones that's\nin there too is the availability,\n\n635\n00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:22.860\nmaking sure that your users are have\nthe data readily available to them and\n\n636\n00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.900\nthe backups are definitely\na way that we can protect that.\n\n637\n00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.140\nSo, I would send it back to you Mike, but\n\n638\n00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.010\nhe's already said that he is\nleaving you with a cliffhanger.\n\n639\n00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.308\nYou're gonna come back for part two.\n\n640\n00:32:32.308 --> 00:32:35.400\nSo, that's perfect place to go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n641\n00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.400\nAs always Mike,\nwe appreciate you being here.\n\n642\n00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.971\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n643\n00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:42.057\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n644\n00:32:42.057 --> 00:32:42.927\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n645\n00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.333\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n646\n00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:49.534\n[MUSIC]\n\n647\n00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:54.028\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.427\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:08.293\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:11.895\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.365\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:15.907\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n8\n00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:20.350\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our GIAC security essentials.\n\n9\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.510\nThat's right, GSEC essentials and\nwe're coming back with a Part Two.\n\n10\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.970\nJoining us in the studios is none\nother than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.070\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, glad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.190\nAnd yep, continuing on, talking a little\nbit about good old backup and restore.\n\n14\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.240\nSo let's just jump right back into it.\n\n15\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.430\nIn our previous episode we\nhad talked about backups.\n\n16\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420\nWe went through the backup process\nwith Windows Server Backup.\n\n17\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.000\nAnd then I went ahead and\nran the backup so\n\n18\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.650\nnow we've got something to look at\nwhen we talk about doing our restore.\n\n19\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.970\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand I'll show you what we've got.\n\n20\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.380\nSo back in Windows Server Backup,\n\n21\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.150\nI can now see that I have\na little bit of details.\n\n22\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.264\nIf we zoom in here,\n\n23\n00:00:56.264 --> 00:01:00.607\nI can see the last successful backup\nwas done [LAUGH] a few minutes ago, no.\n\n24\n00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:03.960\n[LAUGH] But there you can see that\nthere was a successful backup.\n\n25\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.368\nObviously, there'd be more listed there\nif this was a production environment.\n\n26\n00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:11.462\nDown below that I can see\nsome status messages.\n\n27\n00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:16.803\nI can even click on some of those to\nget some details of what was backed up,\n\n28\n00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:18.250\nand so on.\n\n29\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.045\nDown below that I can see information\nabout my scheduled backup,\n\n30\n00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.810\nwhat it's getting,\nwhen the next runtime is.\n\n31\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.611\nDestination information, I can see how\nmuch space I have left, how many copies,\n\n32\n00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.720\nhow many backups are up there.\n\n33\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.820\nAnd it'll do basically a first-in,\nfirst-out type thing,\n\n34\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.510\nwhereas it'll keep backups\nuntil it runs out of space.\n\n35\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.670\nAnd then if it needs more space,\n\n36\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.192\nit'll push the oldest backups out to\nmake room for the newest backups.\n\n37\n00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:48.690\nAll right, so now what we'll talk\nabout is the Backup Once option.\n\n38\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.698\nWhen you choose Backup Once, you can\neither use your scheduled backup options,\n\n39\n00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.260\nremember we said a lot of\nthings in the scheduled backup.\n\n40\n00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.560\nWe said where we want it go,\nwe told it what we wanted to backup,\n\n41\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.446\nin our case we did a full backup, and\nwe told it to do it at 10 o'clock.\n\n42\n00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:11.131\nIf I wanna just use those options,\nbackup everything, same destination,\n\n43\n00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.530\nI could just use my scheduled\nbackup options, click Next and go.\n\n44\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.900\nIt would not affect my schedule.\n\n45\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.150\nSo remember, it's scheduled to\ndo this every night at 10 PM.\n\n46\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.940\nIf I ran this right now,\nit would still backup tonight at 10 PM,\n\n47\n00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.290\nit would not interfere\nwith my normal schedule.\n\n48\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.220\nJust using the options that were\nconfigured in the schedule.\n\n49\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.170\nOr I can choose different options.\n\n50\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.830\nSo maybe I don't wanna do a full backup.\n\n51\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.088\nIt's the middle of the day,\n\n52\n00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.035\nI just wanna backup something real\nquick before I test something.\n\n53\n00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:43.000\nOr I need to restore it into a VM\nto do a little testing there.\n\n54\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.279\nSo I want to change my options, change my\ndestination, whatever the case may be,\n\n55\n00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.024\nI can choose different options.\n\n56\n00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:51.939\nAnd then I would go through the same\nchoices, run my backup again,\n\n57\n00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.420\nit won't interfere with\nmy backup schedule.\n\n58\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.290\nSo that's what that Backup Once is for.\n\n59\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.520\nWe'll go ahead and cancel that out\ncuz we've already got our backup and\n\n60\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.600\nwe don't want to see it happen again.\n\n61\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.441\nBut now that we have a backup,\nwe can choose Recover, all right.\n\n62\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.140\nRecover is how we restore our\nbackup in the event of a failure.\n\n63\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.397\nAnd first thing it asks me is\nwhere is the backup stored?\n\n64\n00:03:14.397 --> 00:03:18.770\nIs that on this machine or\nanother location like a network or\n\n65\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.435\nsomething like that?\n\n66\n00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.992\nMine happens to be on this server,\nwe got that second drive in here.\n\n67\n00:03:23.992 --> 00:03:28.170\nSo I'll leave it and I'll click Next and\nthen I get a little calendar view.\n\n68\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.637\nAnd this is pretty cool because what\nit's gonna do, I'm gonna click away, and\n\n69\n00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:32.540\nthen kinda zoom in.\n\n70\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.010\nYou see how the 14 is bold?\n\n71\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.970\nThe blue box around the 14\njust means that's today.\n\n72\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.896\nBut the fact that the number 14 is bold\nmeans there was a backup form that day.\n\n73\n00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:46.230\nAnd normally you'd see other\ndays that were bold as well.\n\n74\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.970\nAnd what you can do is you can\nclick on a particular day and\n\n75\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.440\nthen you get a drop down list of all\nthe backups that were made on that day and\n\n76\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.380\nyou can pick the appropriate one.\n\n77\n00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.190\nIn my case, again,\nwe've only got the one to pick from.\n\n78\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.726\nSo I'll choose the 14th and\n\n79\n00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:04.547\nI'll choose from the drop down list\nthe one that we did at the 3:52 PM.\n\n80\n00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:09.648\nAnd you can see Recoverable Items and\nit says Bare Metal.\n\n81\n00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:13.430\nIf I click on that, it'll actually\nshow me what is in the backup.\n\n82\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.480\nMaybe I don't know what\nbackup was done last Sunday.\n\n83\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.275\nWas it a full backup, was it just a few\nfiles that were backed up, what was it?\n\n84\n00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.220\nI can see that in this backup\nit was a full or a bare metal,\n\n85\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.629\ncuz I can see all\nthe different pieces there.\n\n86\n00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.665\nYou can see Bare Metal Recovery,\nyou'll also see AD and TDS, right?\n\n87\n00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.705\nThat's because this is\na domain controller, so\n\n88\n00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:36.085\nit did include\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n89\n00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.335\nYou'll also see, let's see where in there?\n\n90\n00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:43.050\nI don't see, FRS and then that GUID,\n\n91\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.650\nthat's my Sysvol folder, what the domain\ncontrollers use for replication.\n\n92\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.400\nYou can see Local Disk C is there,\nmy recovery partition is in there,\n\n93\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.620\nmy EFI system partition is in there,\nmy system state is in there, the registry.\n\n94\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.240\nSo this was a full backup, right.\n\n95\n00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.520\nNow when I go to, I'll click Next,\nand then what I do I wanna restore?\n\n96\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.020\nIf let's say we had lost the machine or\n\n97\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.480\nwe were moving this to\na new piece of hardware.\n\n98\n00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.110\nSo we went ahead and\nbuilt our new piece of hardware.\n\n99\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.855\nWe installed the operating\nsystem as a fresh install.\n\n100\n00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:18.115\nAnd then I could restore the system state,\n\n101\n00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:21.045\nthe configuration to\nthat operating system.\n\n102\n00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:24.925\nOr maybe I wanna restore applications\nif they had registered with\n\n103\n00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.465\nWindows Server Backup and\nwere included in the backup.\n\n104\n00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:30.845\nWe can restore entire volumes\nif we had a D drive, an E drive,\n\n105\n00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.865\nor in this case I got my C drive.\n\n106\n00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.775\nOr we can do individual files and\nfolders, that's pretty cool.\n\n107\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.550\nWith Windows Server Backup,\n\n108\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.750\nwe can actually backup\nindividual files and folders.\n\n109\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.301\nWe did a full backup, let me cancel\nthis for a second and just show you.\n\n110\n00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:51.270\nI'll do a Backup Once and I'll choose\ndifferent options and I'll click Next.\n\n111\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.080\nAnd instead of doing a full like we did,\nI could do custom.\n\n112\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.200\nAnd then I can click Add Items,\nand actually come in here and say,\n\n113\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.870\nyou know what,\nI just need my profile backed up.\n\n114\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.040\nI wanna restore that somewhere else,\nso I come here and\n\n115\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.040\ncheck it and click OK, and\nnow it'll include that.\n\n116\n00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.192\nOr I might have a folder that\nhas a bunch of reports that I\n\n117\n00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:15.390\nwanna make a backup of to restore\nsomewhere else or something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.630\nSo you can use Windows Server Backup\nto backup individual files and folders.\n\n119\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.850\n&gt;&gt; That sounds convenient.\n\n120\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.260\nLike, maybe that's a file server,\n\n121\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.300\nmaybe you don't need some of\nthe crucial systems state data.\n\n122\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.930\nMaybe you've got more than one for,\n\n123\n00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.130\nor maybe even running something\nlike the distributed file system.\n\n124\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.650\nI just need to get these files out of\nthat, like you said, that one folder,\n\n125\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.520\nthat network chair where\neverybody saves them.\n\n126\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.121\nYou can get very granular in this case,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and I'll go back\ninto the Recover console here, and\n\n128\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.570\nI'll get back to where we were.\n\n129\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.659\nSo if I choose Files and Folders, it'll\nactually allow me to browse that backup\n\n130\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.360\nand navigate down into,\nI don't know, Users.\n\n131\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.510\nI don't really have\nanything on this machine.\n\n132\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.298\nBut let's see if I got\nanything in downloads.\n\n133\n00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:56.712\nLook, there's desktop.ini.\n\n134\n00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:59.810\nI could choose to restore\njust that one file.\n\n135\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:06.391\nOr I could restore the entire volume,\nor again, that system state.\n\n136\n00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:10.582\nDo keep in mind, if this is a domain\ncontroller, which this happens to be,\n\n137\n00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:13.510\nin order to recover\nthe Active Directory database,\n\n138\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.921\nI am gonna have to either stop\nthe Active Directory service.\n\n139\n00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:20.444\nOr I'm gonna have to boot it up into\nDirectory Service Restore mode to be able\n\n140\n00:07:20.444 --> 00:07:23.652\nto overwrite that Active Directory\ndatabase cuz it can't be in use.\n\n141\n00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.880\nSo just something to keep in mind.\n\n142\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.696\nSo if I click Next, again, I could go and\npick, yeah, we'll go ahead and\n\n143\n00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:32.664\nrestore that desktop.ini just\nto see the process here.\n\n144\n00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:36.030\nSo we'll go to Downloads,\nwe'll choose that, we'll click Next.\n\n145\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.670\nOther options, do I want to put this in\nthe original location or another location?\n\n146\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.000\nAgain, maybe I am changing things up and\n\n147\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.250\nI want to just restore this\nto a different machine.\n\n148\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.100\nDoesn't have the same drive letters,\nso I want to put it somewhere else.\n\n149\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.488\nCreate copies so that I have both\nversions, or I'm sorry, I'll back up and\n\n150\n00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:55.048\nzoom in.\n\n151\n00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:57.640\nIf there's already,\nif there's a duplicate, right,\n\n152\n00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.854\nlet's say I'm restoring\nthat desktop.ini but\n\n153\n00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:03.149\nthere's already a desktop.ini in\nthe location I'm restoring it too.\n\n154\n00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.727\nWhat is it supposed to do?\n\n155\n00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:05.599\nCreate a copy so\n\n156\n00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:09.790\nthat I have the one that's currently\nthere plus the one I restored.\n\n157\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.990\nOr override the one that's there\nwith the one I'm restoring.\n\n158\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.340\nOr skip it if it already exists.\n\n159\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.520\nWhich is something I've done many times,\n\n160\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.110\nhave a backup of a folder that has\nhundreds or thousands of files in it.\n\n161\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.750\nSome of those files got deleted.\n\n162\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.230\nI don't know which ones.\n\n163\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.680\nWell, I can go to my backup and\nI can restore the entire folder, and\n\n164\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.780\njust tell it, hey, don't recover\nanything that already exists.\n\n165\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.910\nSo it's only gonna replace the files\nthat were accidentally deleted, right?\n\n166\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.760\nSo a great option there.\n\n167\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.940\nAlso restore the access control list for\nthe file or folder.\n\n168\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.370\nDo I want the permissions to\ncome back along with that?\n\n169\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.006\nOr do I wanna just inherent permissions\nof my restoration location?\n\n170\n00:08:48.006 --> 00:08:53.080\nAll right, I'll click overwrite\nthe existing, we'll click Next.\n\n171\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.210\nAnd then recover and it shouldn't take too\nlong to replace that one desktop.ii file.\n\n172\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.700\nThere we go, we are good.\n\n173\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.440\nBut at least you got\nto see the process and\n\n174\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.560\nthe options that were available,\nas we go through that restore process.\n\n175\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.320\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, what if we didn't have\nto restore maybe all of these files?\n\n176\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.850\nMaybe it was a machine here and we just\nwanted to restore like configurations of\n\n177\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.430\nthe system state without\nall the other process.\n\n178\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.010\nWindows have built-in to a way that\nwe can restore that information?\n\n179\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we would just said just\nto restore that system state and\n\n180\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.120\nnot the other volumes,\nit would have done just that.\n\n181\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.570\nAll right, one more thing I wanna talk\nabout here is another, kind of goes along\n\n182\n00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.900\nthe lines here with backups and restore,\nand that's device driver rollback.\n\n183\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.020\nIt's an option that a lot of people forget\nabout, it is important that we remember\n\n184\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.490\nthat Windows gives us the ability\nto roll back a driver.\n\n185\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.140\nRemember a driver is a piece of\nsoftware that allows my hardware or\n\n186\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.630\nmy operating system to interact\nwith a piece of hardware.\n\n187\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.710\nSo you have drivers for your mouse,\nfor keyboard, for your video card, and\n\n188\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.700\nall of that, right.\n\n189\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.800\nThese are the instructions tells,\ncuz the operating system\n\n190\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.408\ncan know how to talk to every\nsingle piece of hardware out there.\n\n191\n00:10:03.408 --> 00:10:06.820\nSo vendors, right, drivers,\nthey go with their hardware.\n\n192\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.530\nThat abstract that layer\nbetween the OS and\n\n193\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.360\nthe physical piece of hardware and\nallow it to communicate with, and\n\n194\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.000\ntake advantage of all the functions\nof that particular piece of hardware.\n\n195\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.460\nIf we update the driver,,\nsometimes that can cause problems.\n\n196\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.900\nThere's compatibility issues with that\nnew driver, that new driver doesn't work.\n\n197\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.820\nOr somebody mistakenly updated\na driver to an incompatible version,\n\n198\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.330\nor one that wasn't meant for\nthat particular device.\n\n199\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.510\nHow do we get it back?\n\n200\n00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.939\nAnd we could do a restore, I mean if\nwe had a full backup of that machine,\n\n201\n00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:38.381\nwe could obviously restore.\n\n202\n00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:44.099\nBut we always wanna try the easiest,\nleast intrusive, least disruptive ways\n\n203\n00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:49.221\nfirst before we resort to wipe in\nthe system and do a complete restore.\n\n204\n00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:52.160\nSo it's important we understand\nabout device driver rollback.\n\n205\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.654\nAnd again it just allows me to go in and\n\n206\n00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.795\nroll the driver back to\nthe previous version.\n\n207\n00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:01.921\nBecause you know Wes, if you you have ever\nrun into this, you update a driver and\n\n208\n00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:05.319\nall of a sudden you think you got\nthe right driver, you update it.\n\n209\n00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:07.261\nLet's say I was doing my video driver and\n\n210\n00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:10.591\nall of a sudden it reboots because\nit was a driver that was installed.\n\n211\n00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:13.480\nAnd now my screen is all sideways,\nand I can't see anything.\n\n212\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.270\nOr my mouse no longer works.\n\n213\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.830\nWhat do I do?\n\n214\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.580\nWell, I can roll back to\nthat previous driver.\n\n215\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.450\nAnd if it wasn't for Windows, did you\nremember to write down the version of\n\n216\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.360\nthe driver that you were updating, right?\n\n217\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.100\nWe all get excited.\n\n218\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.290\nWe go, ooh, there's a new driver out.\n\n219\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.870\nLet me go get it.\n\n220\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.480\nLet me install it.\n\n221\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.960\nIt doesn't work, crud.\n\n222\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.210\nWhat was the working version?\n\n223\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.890\nWhat driver did I have that was working,\nhow do I get back to that?\n\n224\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.290\nCan I even go find it, right?\n\n225\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.860\nSometimes finding the older driver out\nthere to download it, can be tricky.\n\n226\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.990\nSo Windows will remember the last\ndriver you've used on these devices.\n\n227\n00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.920\nIt doesn't remember every driver, right?\n\n228\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.020\nIt's kind of a first in,\nfirst out, but only one slot.\n\n229\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.920\nSo when you update your driver, the old\ndriver it gets moved into that slot.\n\n230\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.556\nAnd that's all it remembers,\nit's just the latest driver,\n\n231\n00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:00.035\nthe one right before the upgrade.\n\n232\n00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:03.140\nIf you upgrade it again,\nit bumps that one out, takes this one,\n\n233\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.319\nputs it in that spot and allows you\nto put that new driver in place.\n\n234\n00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:09.469\nSo it's only gonna be able\nto roll back one driver,\n\n235\n00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:13.595\nit's not gonna roll back three\ndrivers ago or anything like that.\n\n236\n00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:16.670\nRight, and how you do it,\nis pretty straightforward.\n\n237\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.690\nYou go into Device Manager, so I'm gonna\nright click over here on my little\n\n238\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.290\nWindows logo, and choose Device Manager.\n\n239\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.520\nAnother thing we should understand about\ndriver rollback is it's only available\n\n240\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.260\nif you've updated the driver.\n\n241\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.470\nIf you haven't updated the driver,\nthere's nothing to roll back to, so\n\n242\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.320\nit would not work.\n\n243\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.660\nSo let me jump in here.\n\n244\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.600\nWe're gonna go update one\nof my drivers real quick.\n\n245\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.170\nI'm gonna go to my miles which\nI should be be able to update\n\n246\n00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.890\nwithout causing any major\nproblem on my system.\n\n247\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.510\nSo, let me just use\nupdate driver software.\n\n248\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.690\nNotice right now it says\nHID compliant mouse.\n\n249\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.357\nI'm gonna update driver software.\n\n250\n00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.960\nAnd I'm gonna browse my computer.\n\n251\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.730\nActually, no, before I do that, let's\njust look at the properties of this guy.\n\n252\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.460\nThere's the current driver,\nMicrosoft, released back in 2006.\n\n253\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.040\nAnd notice my rollback\ndriver button Is grayed out.\n\n254\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.870\nIt's not available,\nbecause I haven't upgraded the driver yet.\n\n255\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.270\nSo now I am gonna update that driver.\n\n256\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.710\nI'll browse my computer.\n\n257\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.000\nI'll pick from a list because\nI don't have the disk.\n\n258\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.040\nAnd I'm going to uncheck the compatible\nhardware, which is usually a no-no.\n\n259\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.935\nBut for this demonstration,\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n260\n00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:30.168\nAnd I'm gonna tell it it's\nactually a PS2 mouse.\n\n261\n00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:36.420\nI'll click Next and yes even\nthe windows is telling me don't do it.\n\n262\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.318\nI'm gonna do it anyway just for\nyou ladies and gentlemen out there.\n\n263\n00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:44.303\nWindows found an error, cannot start.\n\n264\n00:13:44.303 --> 00:13:48.586\nAll right, we'll click Close and\nlet's see what happened here.\n\n265\n00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:51.528\nSo it did update the driver.\n\n266\n00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:53.710\nLet's go ahead and reboot the system.\n\n267\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.020\nI can see I've got a nasty\nlittle warning over there.\n\n268\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.540\nBut it does say PS-2 mouse, all right.\n\n269\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.650\nI could probably actually skip the reboot\nsince it's already listed there.\n\n270\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.110\nNormally, to get the driver to actually\nkick in, I need to reboot the system.\n\n271\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.190\nBecause drivers are loaded\nup during the boot process.\n\n272\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.260\nAs many times you change your driver,\nyou then reboot the system so\n\n273\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.250\nthat driver will actually start\nbeing used by your operating system.\n\n274\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.500\nWe're just doing a little demonstration\nto show you driver rollback.\n\n275\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.049\nSo it's not important that\nit's actually using it,\n\n276\n00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:29.290\nwhat's important is that it's\nlisted here as the current driver.\n\n277\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.702\nAnd when I go to look at\nthe properties of this device,\n\n278\n00:14:33.702 --> 00:14:37.798\nI can see I now have a rollback driver.\n\n279\n00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:39.860\nSo it's giving me the option to\nroll back to a previous driver.\n\n280\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.210\nSo I'm gonna click on that\nto rollback that driver.\n\n281\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.850\nAnd it wants to know why\nI'm rolling it back and\n\n282\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.200\nI'm just gonna say,\nmy apps don't work with this driver.\n\n283\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.930\nI'll click Yes.\n\n284\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.754\nAnd there we go, it rolled it back.\n\n285\n00:14:56.754 --> 00:15:00.975\nYou might have seen those numbers change,\nyou'll notice it now says\n\n286\n00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:06.550\nHID-compliant mouse over there instead\nof PS2 mouse, my little warning is gone.\n\n287\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.175\nAlso my Rollback Driver button is gone,\nright?\n\n288\n00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:10.570\nBecause I'm back to that one driver.\n\n289\n00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.970\nAnd I'll click Close, and that's it.\n\n290\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.030\nSo it's really very easy\nto do in Device Manager.\n\n291\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.620\nYou just pull up the properties of\nthe device, go to that Driver tab,\n\n292\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.700\nand click the button.\n\n293\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.040\nAnd Microsoft will go back to\nthe previously used driver.\n\n294\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.550\nAgain, you'll have to reboot\nthe system to get that to kick in.\n\n295\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.860\nJust a good idea to remember that that's\nthere, a lot of people forget about it.\n\n296\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.200\nAnd they start trying much\nmore intrusive systems, or\n\n297\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.210\nmuch more intrusive methods,\nthat end up with data loss.\n\n298\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.700\nIf we had to go to a backup.\n\n299\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.150\nIf that backup was made an hour ago,\nwell I'm losing an hour's worth of data.\n\n300\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.771\nIf It was made last night,\n\n301\n00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:53.162\nI'm potentially losing all the data that's\nbeen changed since that backup was made.\n\n302\n00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:57.902\nIt might be my only choice, but\nhaving the ability to roll back\n\n303\n00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:02.933\nan individual driver like that can\nsave me a lot of that headache.\n\n304\n00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:05.860\nAnd that is really just about it.\n\n305\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.610\nWe got to look at the entire back up\nprocess, we saw the restore process and\n\n306\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.620\nwe talked about how to\nroll back a device driver.\n\n307\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.060\n&gt;&gt; I could tell you Mike,\nwhen you say least intrusive method,\n\n308\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.640\nthat is a good piece of advice.\n\n309\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.814\nBecause what happens if you do install\na driver just like you seen Mike do and\n\n310\n00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.274\nyou get the legendary\nblue screen of death.\n\n311\n00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:26.310\nWell, your first thought is to freak out.\n\n312\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.050\nSo what can I do to get\nmy system back online?\n\n313\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.880\nI know, I've done it myself with\nthings like repair disks when I really\n\n314\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.580\ndidn't need to.\n\n315\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd don't forget you can do this in safe\n\n316\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.820\nmode, right, which is typically\nwhere we're going to be doing it.\n\n317\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.910\nIf you install a driver like Wes said,\nthat blue screened your system,\n\n318\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.460\nhow do you get to device manager\nto actually roll back the driver?\n\n319\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.800\nWell, we boot the system in safe mode.\n\n320\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.870\nRemember what safe mode is.\n\n321\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.810\nSafe mode doesn't use the drivers\nthat you've installed or updated,\n\n322\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.860\nor anything like that.\n\n323\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.810\nSafe mode only loads up known,\ngood, basic drivers and\n\n324\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.630\nonly for the peripherals are absolutely\nnecessary to start the system.\n\n325\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.641\nSo it's not gonna be\nusing your video driver,\n\n326\n00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:11.272\nit's not gonna load up the driver for\nyour printer, and\n\n327\n00:17:11.272 --> 00:17:15.930\nall of that is just loading bare\nminimum drivers to operate the system.\n\n328\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.795\nA generic video card hard driver and\nthings like that,\n\n329\n00:17:20.795 --> 00:17:24.918\njust enough to allow me\nto get into the system in\n\n330\n00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:29.910\nwonderful 8 bit color and\n640 x 480 resolution.\n\n331\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.170\nHey but hey but hey,\nat least I can get in,\n\n332\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.110\nI can launch the device manager,\nand I can roll back the driver.\n\n333\n00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.380\nAnd then I can, cuz most likely\nthat's what's caused the problem,\n\n334\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.440\nif I just installed a driver, and\nnow my system has blue screened,\n\n335\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.460\nthere's a really, really high probability\nthat the driver's causing the problem.\n\n336\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.160\nSo first easiest step is, hey,\nlet's get rid of that driver and\n\n337\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.150\nsee if that truly was causing the problem.\n\n338\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.920\nGo in safe mode, roll back your driver,\nreboot the system, boot in a normal mode,\n\n339\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.730\nif everything's good, then you know it was\nthe driver that was causing the problem.\n\n340\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\none of the features I like Mike,\n\n341\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.610\ncuz there have been\ntimes where the screen,\n\n342\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.890\nit's blue screened on me, and\nI couldn't get to safe mode manually.\n\n343\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.370\nAnd one of the things it's\nbuilt into Windows and\n\n344\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.295\nwe really hope you don't\never have to deal with this.\n\n345\n00:18:13.295 --> 00:18:13.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:18:13.804 --> 00:18:15.150\n&gt;&gt; It's a good thing but\n\n347\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.160\nI guess it's a bad thing that\nleads to a good feature,\n\n348\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.158\nsomething called automatic failover.\n\n349\n00:18:19.158 --> 00:18:22.340\nAnd every time the operating system\nactually launches what's kinda cool is\n\n350\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.930\nthat it sets its little flag\nthat tells the main kernel okay,\n\n351\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.610\nreboot into safe mode.\n\n352\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.220\nWell, if the boot process finishes\nsuccessfully, it actually removes that\n\n353\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.300\nflag, and then the next time\nthe bootloader loads it says, okay,\n\n354\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.860\nthere's not a problem here,\nwe'll go ahead and load normally.\n\n355\n00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.370\nToo many of these reboots like that,\nspecifically in the blue screen, and\n\n356\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.270\nit's gonna automatically failover.\n\n357\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.900\nAnd fail you over into safe mode.\n\n358\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.335\nSo it's nice little feature that's handy\nif you just can't get to that keyboard\n\n359\n00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:47.948\nfast enough.\n\n360\n00:18:47.948 --> 00:18:49.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike,\n\n361\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.540\nit does look like we are coming to\nthe end of yet another great episode.\n\n362\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.980\nBut before we do, Mike, do you got any\nadditional things you might like to throw\n\n363\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.529\nin there when it comes to things like\nyour backup and your restoration?\n\n364\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.717\n&gt;&gt; If anything just remember\nbackups are obviously important.\n\n365\n00:19:04.717 --> 00:19:09.353\nIt is something that we have to plan out,\nyou have to understand full versus\n\n366\n00:19:09.353 --> 00:19:13.917\nincremental versus differential,\non site versus off site, storage for\n\n367\n00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:18.407\nthose backups and maybe install Windows\nserver backup and test it out and\n\n368\n00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:22.087\nplay with it even though it might\nnot be enterprise level and\n\n369\n00:19:22.087 --> 00:19:26.960\nwe probably have other software in\nour enterprise to handle our backups.\n\n370\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.451\nIt's still a good idea to have a good\nunderstanding of Windows Server Backup cuz\n\n371\n00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:32.233\nit can be used for those one off backups.\n\n372\n00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:35.980\nAnd a backup of that particular folder and\nthings like that.\n\n373\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo still a good utility to have around.\n\n374\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nwell Mike as always words of wisdom.\n\n375\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.079\nWe appreciate you being\nhere in the studio and\n\n376\n00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:45.371\nwe appreciate you the viewer\nout there

IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.364\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here in IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:15.529\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.247\nAnd in todays episode, we are continuing\nthrough our GIAC fundamentals, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:22.906\njoining me back in the studios for\nthis very endeavor, is none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:23.655\nMike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:24.675\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:28.305\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, glad to be back and\nyeah, more GIAC, excited, excited.\n\n11\n00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.075\nToday we're going to be looking\nat templates and group policy.\n\n12\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:35.300\nReally it's all about controlling\nthe configuration of the devices\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.060\non our network and\nwhat tools are available for\n\n14\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.620\nus because as an admin\nwe need to be familiar.\n\n15\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.420\nWhat are my options?\n\n16\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.655\nWhat is the best way to\naccomplish this task?\n\n17\n00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.635\nSo, we're going to take a look at it from\na couple of different tools perspectives.\n\n18\n00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:51.525\nAnd we're going to talk about pros and\ncons of each, right?\n\n19\n00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.095\nAnd let's start with the basic, and\n\n20\n00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.625\nthat would be our local\ngroup policy editor, right?\n\n21\n00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.335\nWe're talking about a local group policy.\n\n22\n00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:06.145\nEvery Windows based machine\nhas a local group policy.\n\n23\n00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:09.830\nA group policy is just\na collection of configurations or\n\n24\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.200\nsettings that we can make.\n\n25\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.740\nAnd we can then take that policy and\napply it to the machine.\n\n26\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.500\nAnd just like when we talk about local\naccounts versus domain accounts,\n\n27\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.660\nor local this versus domain that, local\nmeans it applies to that one machine.\n\n28\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.807\nSo for example, my laptop has a local GPO,\na local group policy,\n\n29\n00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:30.998\non it that I can configure\nsettings in there.\n\n30\n00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:35.700\nBut that's not going to affect machine or\nanybody else on the network, right?\n\n31\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.312\nSo when I use that local policy,\n\n32\n00:01:37.312 --> 00:01:40.858\nwhat we need to keep in mind is that\nwe're only affecting one machine.\n\n33\n00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:44.892\nIf you got a small shop with just a couple\nof machines, or a half dozen machines,\n\n34\n00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:48.748\nmaybe you want to use the local policy,\nyou'll have to configure each one,\n\n35\n00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:52.062\nthere is a way import and\nexport some of those settings but\n\n36\n00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:54.980\nyou're basically configuring\neach machine on its own.\n\n37\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.250\nAnd in the domain environment\nthat's probably not going to be,\n\n38\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.150\nwhen you've got thousands of clients or\nhundreds of servers,\n\n39\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.600\nyou know local policy is probably not\nthe way to go for most scenarios.\n\n40\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.495\nBut that means you won't use it, right?\n\n41\n00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:10.945\nI have got that one off machine that\nlittle kiosk machine that sits out there\n\n42\n00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:14.995\nit needs settings or configurations that\nno other machine in my network needs.\n\n43\n00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:19.082\nThe easiest way to do that might just\nbe to use the local policy editor\n\n44\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:20.242\nOn that machine.\n\n45\n00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:21.802\nOr that one conference room machine,\n\n46\n00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:24.782\nagain, that has one off settings\nthat no other machine needs.\n\n47\n00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:28.192\nA local policy is a perfect solution for\nsomething like that.\n\n48\n00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:30.322\nSo just because we're in\na domain environment,\n\n49\n00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:34.362\nI don't want you to think that we\nwon't be using the local policy.\n\n50\n00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.337\nLet me show you how to pull it up and\nwhat it's got in it.\n\n51\n00:02:36.337 --> 00:02:40.812\nAlright, so looking at my PC here, if I\nwant to work with my local group policy\n\n52\n00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:47.808\nobject, easiest way is just going\nto run into a little gpedit.msc.\n\n53\n00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:52.810\nAnd I will open up your local Group Policy\neditor and it's not important that\n\n54\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.810\nwe understand what every single setting\nin here is at this point at least not for\n\n55\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.410\nthis exam I mean in the real world it\nwould help you to know a lot of these\n\n56\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.750\nsettings but it's really more of the\nconcepts here that I want to show you This\n\n57\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.990\nis a local policy, and there are hundreds\nof settings in here that we can configure.\n\n58\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.860\nWe take a look up here at the local\npolicy, and you can see under the computer\n\n59\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.020\nhalf there's software settings,\nWindows settings, administrator templates.\n\n60\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.960\nUnder the user portion,\nthere's the same thing.\n\n61\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.970\nSoftware, Windows,\nadministrative templates,\n\n62\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.590\nmost of these are going to be\ncreating changes to the registry.\n\n63\n00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.010\nWhich is where Windows stores all\nof its configuration information.\n\n64\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.020\nSo for example we could expand out,\nI don't know, administrative templates.\n\n65\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.520\nAnd take a look at Control Panel.\n\n66\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520\nAnd then maybe personalization.\n\n67\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.260\nAnd I could make sure\nthey're using a screen saver.\n\n68\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.730\nI could force the screen saver whether or\n\n69\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.960\nnot they Password protect\nthe screen saver, right?\n\n70\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.150\nThat's a nice security thing where\nwhen that screen saver kicks in,\n\n71\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.670\nif somebody walks by and wiggles the\nmouse, and it goes to wake up the machine,\n\n72\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.760\ndo you have to enter a password or\nnot to get back into that machine?\n\n73\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.690\nEnd users hate that because they\nturn around, they do something,\n\n74\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.340\nthey come back their machine went\nto the screen saver kicked in.\n\n75\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.540\nThey go to wake it up,\nthey gotta retype their password.\n\n76\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.710\nThey won't turn it on.\n\n77\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.090\nBut I can turn it on using policies right?\n\n78\n00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.840\nSo this local GPO is a way that I\ncan configure these settings for\n\n79\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.850\nthis local machine.\n\n80\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.710\nAnd to configure any of these settings,\n\n81\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.200\nyou would just double click on\nthe particular setting you wanted.\n\n82\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.550\nI say that and\neventually it should open there we go.\n\n83\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.930\nAnd most settings by default\nare not configured All right but\n\n84\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.350\nwe can choose to either enable them or\ndisable them.\n\n85\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.720\nIf you enable it, you're turning it on.\n\n86\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.030\nIf you disable it,\nyou're turning it off, right.\n\n87\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.400\nNot configured means I\ndon't care either way.\n\n88\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.810\nIt might be turned on,\nit might be turned off.\n\n89\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.970\nThis policy doesn't effect\nthat setting at all.\n\n90\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.850\nOkay?\n\n91\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.450\nSo any one of those, I could come\nin here and I could turn it on and\n\n92\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.020\nI could click OK.\n\n93\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.260\nAnd that's going to apply only\nto this particular machine.\n\n94\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.110\nNow, what if maybe I'm not sure exactly\nwhat this setting is going to do, Mike?\n\n95\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.380\nIs there any way that I could kind of\nfigure that out without Good old search\n\n96\n00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.370\nengine here and a search engine's always\nhelp but maybe I don't have access.\n\n97\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft did a really\ngood job in group policies.\n\n98\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.570\nThey've got this whole, all of this\ntext right here is a description for\n\n99\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.670\nthe policy.\n\n100\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.400\nSo if you have the standard tab selected,\nyou don't see that help description\n\n101\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.980\nYou have the extended tab\nyou see all of this help.\n\n102\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.810\nAlso when you're inside the setting,\nonce you've double clicked on it.\n\n103\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.450\nYou've got all this text here\nwhich is basically a repeat\n\n104\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.640\nof what you were seeing on\nthat other screen, all right?\n\n105\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.400\nSo that's the local GPO again,\nthat's gonna apply to this one machine.\n\n106\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.290\nIt would apply to all the users\nthat use that machine.\n\n107\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.760\nSo it's not just a single account or\nanything like that but\n\n108\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.720\nall the people that use\nthat particular machine.\n\n109\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.480\nAnother way we could apply\nconfiguration changes to a machine\n\n110\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.260\nwould be use what we call\na security template, alright?\n\n111\n00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.040\nIn fact, let me open up GP Edit\none more time, if i can type.\n\n112\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.232\nMan, my spelling is bad today.\n\n113\n00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:50.099\nHm, .msc.\n\n114\n00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.188\nAnd I'm also gonna open up what's\ncalled a Microsoft Management Console.\n\n115\n00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:58.286\nWent to my Start menu, I typed mmc for\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n116\n00:05:58.286 --> 00:06:02.580\nI'm going to hit Enter, and this is\nbasically a blank tool that allows me to\n\n117\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.665\nadd what we call snap-ins\nto give it functionality.\n\n118\n00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.715\nThere's different snap-ins for\ndifferent purposes.\n\n119\n00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:11.032\nOne of them is gonna be to\nwork with security templates.\n\n120\n00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:14.098\nYou go to File Add/Remove Snap-In, and\n\n121\n00:06:14.098 --> 00:06:18.750\nthen I can find my security\ntemplates snap-in, for example.\n\n122\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.020\nI click Add to add it this\npane over here on the right,\n\n123\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.710\nand that's going to become\npart of my console.\n\n124\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.590\nMaybe I also want the security\nconfiguration in an analysis snap-in, and\n\n125\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.550\nI can add that one as well.\n\n126\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.140\nAnd you'll see that there's\nseveral The advantage of an MMC,\n\n127\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.130\nmost of these tools are available\nin Windows somewhere.\n\n128\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.820\nEither under Administrative Tools or\nsomewhere else, but\n\n129\n00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.710\nthey're all separate tools.\n\n130\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.450\nIf there are certain things I do all\nthe time, I need a group of tools that I'm\n\n131\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.260\nalways opening up, I can add all\nthose different ones to this one MMC.\n\n132\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.090\nSave it, and now anytime I need that\ngroup of tools I can open up one console\n\n133\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.250\nthat has all five or ten or however\nmany tools you choose to add to it.\n\n134\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.500\nSo I'll click okay.\n\n135\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.470\nAnd if I wanted to keep this,\nI would just do file, save, and\n\n136\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:06.659\nmaybe I'll dump it out on the desktop and\nI'll call it security tools.\n\n137\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.190\nSomething like that, we'll click save.\n\n138\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.530\nAnd that way, there it is.\n\n139\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.640\nEvery time I need these tools,\nI can open it up.\n\n140\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.490\nSo a little side note there for the MMC.\n\n141\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.530\nBut security templates, are interesting.\n\n142\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.419\nWhen you first installed or add that\nsecurity template's snap-in, it creates\n\n143\n00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.536\na folder underneath your user account,\ninside your documents called security, And\n\n144\n00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:30.470\nthen a folder under that called templates,\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.380\nAnd you need to create a template\nfirst by right clicking\n\n146\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.220\non that folder that created.\n\n147\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.330\nAnd choosing new template and\nwill give it a name and I called this one.\n\n148\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.289\nTest because I'm not really feeling\nall that creative right now.\n\n149\n00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:47.729\nSo now I have this new\ntemplate called Test, and\n\n150\n00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:51.943\nin here are a bunch of settings and\nalmost very similar to,\n\n151\n00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:56.502\nits actually a subset of the settings\nI would see in a local GPO.\n\n152\n00:07:56.502 --> 00:07:57.619\nLet's do this.\n\n153\n00:07:57.619 --> 00:07:59.350\nLet's snap this guy over here.\n\n154\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.281\nPut this one over here.\n\n155\n00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.549\nSo on the left,\nI have my security template.\n\n156\n00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:07.000\nOn the right, I have my local GPU.\n\n157\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.873\nAnd on my local GPU, I'm going to\nexpand out, windows settings, and\n\n158\n00:08:11.873 --> 00:08:15.350\nthen I'm gonna expand out,\nsecurity settings.\n\n159\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.770\nAnd I want you to take a look at\nthese settings here, all right,\n\n160\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.506\nall of these guys here,\nand these right here.\n\n161\n00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:29.940\nAccount policies, local polices,\nevent log, restricted groups.\n\n162\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.840\nAll right,\nlet's see if we see those over here.\n\n163\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.820\nWe don't see restricted groups.\n\n164\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.480\nSystem services, so you'll see a lot\nof duplication with these settings.\n\n165\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.653\nYou'll find the restricted groups,\nI wanna say is under, well,\n\n166\n00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:46.165\nit's not allowed in a local policy,\nthat's correct.\n\n167\n00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:50.216\nSo you see, basically,\na security template is a subset of\n\n168\n00:08:50.216 --> 00:08:54.037\nthe security-related\nsettings from the GPU, okay?\n\n169\n00:08:54.037 --> 00:08:56.220\nAnd what does security\ntemplate allows me to do?\n\n170\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.350\nLet me get our window maximized here.\n\n171\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.200\nIt allows me to go in and\nconfigure these settings.\n\n172\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.702\nLet's say I wanted to adjust.\n\n173\n00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:06.896\nWhat's a good one we might do?\n\n174\n00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:08.770\nThe password policy.\n\n175\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.712\nWe have account policy settings,\nall of this.\n\n176\n00:09:10.712 --> 00:09:13.450\nWe were gonna go over a couple of\nthese settings in a little bit.\n\n177\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.811\nBut let's say I wanted to go to restricted\ngroups or, let's do a local policy.\n\n178\n00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:24.034\nAnd we'll do a user and it will be\n\n179\n00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:29.260\na good one to show you guys here.\n\n180\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.899\nWho has the ability to\nshut the system down?\n\n181\n00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.717\nSo I'll double click on it, and\nI'll define these policy settings.\n\n182\n00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:38.823\nAll right, and\nif I put in a little check mark there, and\n\n183\n00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:42.605\nI'll click add user group,\nthen I'll browse and I'll find Mike.\n\n184\n00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:44.893\n&gt;&gt; Again,\nI'm just picking a random setting,\n\n185\n00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:49.298\nnot important which one I'm picking, I'll\nclick check names, and okay, and okay.\n\n186\n00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:53.883\nAnd so, I'm basically saying that the user\nMike has the right to shut this machine\n\n187\n00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:57.480\ndown, which I already had,\nbecause I'm a user on this system.\n\n188\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.950\nBut again, that's beside the point,\nat this setting up date.\n\n189\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:06.440\nI'll click OK, and so now I've got that\nparticular setting enabled and configured.\n\n190\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.820\nBut this is just a template,\nit's not applied to anything at all, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.670\nIt's just a collection of the settings.\n\n192\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.820\nAnd what this allows me\nto do is have somebody,\n\n193\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.240\nmaybe I've got somebody that I don't\nwant to work directly with policies, but\n\n194\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.700\nI want them to go ahead and configure\nsome of the settings in a policy.\n\n195\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.640\nI can give them access to a console like\nthis, they can configure all the settings,\n\n196\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.440\nI can then review it, and then take\nthis template and import into a policy.\n\n197\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.200\nSo rather than working\nwith the policy directly,\n\n198\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.580\nthey're working with the same\nsettings outside of the policy.\n\n199\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.460\nThen I can turn around and\n\n200\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.800\nimport those into a policy to\nactually apply those settings.\n\n201\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.660\n&gt;&gt; So, it will give you a good staging\narea to make sure that you've got\n\n202\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.240\neverything right.\n\n203\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.530\nNow Mike, in another episode,\nyou talked about work groups and domains.\n\n204\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.250\nAnd one of the benefits of the domains\nis the centralized administration\n\n205\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.830\nthat you mentioned.\n\n206\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.890\nIf you guys are not aware of that episode,\ncheck it out, and\n\n207\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.630\nthen come back and see us.\n\n208\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.910\nBut with these security templates,\n\n209\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.420\nMike, does my computer have\nto be joined to your domain?\n\n210\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.210\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely not, right?\n\n211\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:05.003\nI mean, some of the domain settings\nwouldn't apply if you're not part of\n\n212\n00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:08.410\na domain, but\nI can import this into a GPO.\n\n213\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.460\nFor example, I could come over here.\n\n214\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.970\nWell, let's take a look at one\nmore tool before we do that.\n\n215\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.270\nSo we've got the security templates.\n\n216\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.480\nYou do need to make sure you\nsave this template, all right?\n\n217\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.900\nWe're gonna right-click on Test itself.\n\n218\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.800\nAnd choose save, cuz when you close this\nconsole, it's gonna ask you if you wanna\n\n219\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.060\nsave console settings, that is not\ntemplate settings, that's the console.\n\n220\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.920\nWhat tools that I add to that\nMMC in the first place, right?\n\n221\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.140\nYou wanna make sure you save the actual\ntemplate by right-clicking on it and\n\n222\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.490\nchoosing Save.\n\n223\n00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.800\nNow, this other tool that I added is\ncalled the Security Configuration and\n\n224\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.730\nAnalysis.\n\n225\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.370\nWhat this allows me to do is compare\nthe current settings on a machine\n\n226\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.850\nwith a template, right?\n\n227\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.860\nSo I might use this to analyze, hey,\nhas this machine's configuration changed?\n\n228\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.740\nIs it still in align with\nthe policy that we created, or\n\n229\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.960\nthe template that we created?\n\n230\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.410\nOr are there some things that I forgot to\nput in the template that are configured on\n\n231\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.290\nthe local machine that I wanna make\nsure I include in the template?\n\n232\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.550\nIt could go either way.\n\n233\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.850\nSo with this tool, you notice there's\nnothing under it when I click on it.\n\n234\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.484\nBecause it needs a scratch pad,\na place to work to do the comparison.\n\n235\n00:12:11.484 --> 00:12:15.327\nSo what you do is you right-click on it,\nand choose Open Database.\n\n236\n00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:18.136\nAnd even though I don't have a database,\nyou choose Open, and\n\n237\n00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:19.255\nit's gonna create one.\n\n238\n00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:22.550\nI'll give it a name of test2.\n\n239\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.480\nAgain, feeling super creative today.\n\n240\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.220\nThen, I'll click Open.\n\n241\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.650\nAnd then it says well,\nwhat template do you want to import?\n\n242\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.390\nAnd notice it goes right to\nmy default templates folder,\n\n243\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.500\nDocuments Security Templates.\n\n244\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.420\nIf you had chose to store those\nsomewhere else, you'd have to browse and\n\n245\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.820\nfind them, select your template,\nand click Open, all right?\n\n246\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.004\nThen give it a second,\nright-click on it one more time,\n\n247\n00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:48.539\nand choose Analyze Computer Now.\n\n248\n00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:51.902\nRight, it's going to wonder where\nto put any errors, and I'll go and\n\n249\n00:12:51.902 --> 00:12:53.339\njust click OK to the default.\n\n250\n00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:56.899\nAnd then what happens is it puts\nthese side by side, for example,\n\n251\n00:12:56.899 --> 00:13:00.510\nlet's go to one we configure,\na user right assignment.\n\n252\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.948\nSo go back to here, right, notice these\nare the same settings that were in my\n\n253\n00:13:03.948 --> 00:13:06.174\ntemplate, I'm gonna go\ndown to the same place.\n\n254\n00:13:06.174 --> 00:13:09.490\nLocal, Policies, User Rights Assignment.\n\n255\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.250\nAnd I can try to zoom in,\nso you can see this there.\n\n256\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.221\nIf I'm right back in the same place,\nand if I scroll down a little bit,\n\n257\n00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:20.609\nnotice there's a red X\non shut down the system.\n\n258\n00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:24.575\nIt's letting me know, hey, there is\na difference between your template and\n\n259\n00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:25.925\nthe currently confixed.\n\n260\n00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:29.310\nSo I don't really have to\nlook at each one, one by one.\n\n261\n00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.820\nI can just look at this icon over here,\n\n262\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.062\nand it will let me know if there's\na discrepancy between the two.\n\n263\n00:13:34.062 --> 00:13:37.480\nThe database setting is\nthe template I imported,\n\n264\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.750\nthere's that lab mic that I configured,\nright?\n\n265\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.560\nThe other column is the current\ncomputer setting, right?\n\n266\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.630\nAnd if we make that a little bit wider,\nyou'll see that there are a few people\n\n267\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.140\nthat were in there that my\ntemplate doesn't include, right?\n\n268\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.950\nBackup operators, users, administrators,\n\n269\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.740\nthey're allowed to shut the system down\naccording to the current configuration.\n\n270\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.270\nMaybe we're doing something,\nmaybe these are lab machine.\n\n271\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.260\nAnd I don't want users to be\nable to power down the machine,\n\n272\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.740\nbecause I need them up and running,\nwe update them at night, or\n\n273\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.860\nwe reset them at night,\nor something like that.\n\n274\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.160\nSo I wanna modify, so that's the kinda\nthing I could do with these templates.\n\n275\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.569\nBut this tool, again,\n\n276\n00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:19.518\nis allowing me to compare the template\nwith the current settings.\n\n277\n00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:23.368\n&gt;&gt; Would that help somebody in maybe your\nsecurity stuff if they are doing some kind\n\n278\n00:14:23.368 --> 00:14:26.074\nof baseline, and\nthe policy says here is the baseline?\n\n279\n00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.943\nI can run this on a computer and\nsay well, I see right text there,\n\n280\n00:14:28.943 --> 00:14:32.026\nI'm comparing now back to the policy,\nsaying it doesn't match, so\n\n281\n00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:34.090\nwe need to take the appropriate action?\n\n282\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, now, and\nyou can even change settings from here.\n\n283\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.780\nI can double click on this, and I'm now\nlooking at the individual settings, shut\n\n284\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:48.520\ndown the system, and I can see where lab\nMike has selected my database settings.\n\n285\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.260\nComputer settings include these others.\n\n286\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.371\nAnd I go, hey, you know what?\n\n287\n00:14:51.371 --> 00:14:55.155\nI probably wanna make sure the\nadministrator can shut down the system,\n\n288\n00:14:55.155 --> 00:14:58.449\nand the back up operators, but\nI'm not gonna include users.\n\n289\n00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:01.446\nAll right, and I'll click OK, and so now,\n\n290\n00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:05.440\nI've updated the settings in my template,\nright?\n\n291\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.770\nMatching in more line what will\nthe computers is currently configure as.\n\n292\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.244\nSo hopefully you're seeing the idea,\nyou create a template,\n\n293\n00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:14.046\nyou can create your settings, and\nthen you can take that template, and\n\n294\n00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.837\nyou can apply it to your system,\nor systems.\n\n295\n00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:20.173\nI can go get that file out of my\ndocument security templates folder,\n\n296\n00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:23.000\nI could copy it to another machine, right?\n\n297\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.620\nAnd then apply th template\nto that one as well.\n\n298\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.372\nBut again, you're just applying to one\nmachine at a time, that's the only thing.\n\n299\n00:15:29.372 --> 00:15:30.760\nYou or\n\n300\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.390\ntake it across the network to get it to\nanother machine to actually apply it.\n\n301\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.110\nI can apply it from right here.\n\n302\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.231\nOnce I've decided I've looked at all\nthe settings, and I've found all my red Xs\n\n303\n00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:44.564\nwhere there's discrepancies, and\nI think my template is good,\n\n304\n00:15:44.564 --> 00:15:48.263\nI can actually right-click on\nthe security configuration analysis and\n\n305\n00:15:48.263 --> 00:15:49.980\nchoose Configure Computer Now.\n\n306\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.711\nNow, with the templates, I don't have,\nlet's if I can get down to test.\n\n307\n00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:59.081\nYou can right-click on here, but you don't\nhave an option to Apply the template from\n\n308\n00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:00.974\nhere, that's what this tool does.\n\n309\n00:16:00.974 --> 00:16:04.388\nI right click and\nthen we chose Analyze earlier which is\n\n310\n00:16:04.388 --> 00:16:09.450\nthe comparison to the template,\nto the current computer configuration.\n\n311\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.610\nIf I choose Configure Computer Now,\nthat's gonna take the template and\n\n312\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.550\nactually apply it to the system.\n\n313\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.860\nSo let's analyze again,\nright click Analyze Computer Now,\n\n314\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.141\ngive it the log file path for errors,\ngo back down in that same location.\n\n315\n00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:28.406\nAnd notice I've got a green\ncheck mark down here,\n\n316\n00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:33.302\nbecause now the settings in the template\nmatch the settings on the computer\n\n317\n00:16:33.302 --> 00:16:38.200\nbecause we have applied the template\nsettings to the local machine.\n\n318\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.740\nSo now everything's in sync.\n\n319\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.264\nSo this allows you, these two tools,\nthe security templates, MMC,\n\n320\n00:16:43.264 --> 00:16:47.030\nallows you to create the security\ntemplates to configure those settings,\n\n321\n00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.159\nwhich again are a subset of\nsettings available in a local GPO.\n\n322\n00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.610\nIt's just the security related settings.\n\n323\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.632\nAnd then the security configuration and\n\n324\n00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:58.081\nanalysis allows you to compare your\ntemplate settings with the local\n\n325\n00:16:58.081 --> 00:17:01.663\nmachine's current configuration to\ndo either one of several things.\n\n326\n00:17:01.663 --> 00:17:05.549\nAs we said, you could compare to see\nif the machine has left its baseline or\n\n327\n00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:09.061\nis no longer in configuration or\nthe appropriate configuration or\n\n328\n00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:12.950\njust to double check that you've got\neverything you want in your security\n\n329\n00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.190\ntemplates like I did, I forgot\nthe administrators and backup operators.\n\n330\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.917\nI wanted to to make sure I\ninclude those in my template.\n\n331\n00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:25.270\nSo those are pretty cool tools again for\nworking with an individual machine.\n\n332\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.000\nBut in our corporate environments\nwe're not gonna use that as much.\n\n333\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.550\nAs I said earlier, we're gonna\nsee this on machines that aren't\n\n334\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:37.210\npart of the domain and those one-off\nmachines, it's a good use for them too.\n\n335\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.190\nThe kiosk, that conference room machine,\n\n336\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:47.150\nthe loner laptop that's not part of\nour domain, whatever the case may be.\n\n337\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.630\nNow, let's see what else\nwe want to look at in here.\n\n338\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.400\nAs far as the local GPO goes,\nlet's take one more look at that.\n\n339\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.637\nIf we go back to my local GPO,\nlet's say we took that template and\n\n340\n00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:02.179\nwe brought it to another machine and\nI wanna apply it.\n\n341\n00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:06.771\nAnother way we can apply it rather than\nusing the security configuration analysis,\n\n342\n00:18:06.771 --> 00:18:10.586\nif I already knew the template was\nperfect, it was just what I wanted,\n\n343\n00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:14.788\nI don't care what the local machine is\nconfigured as now, I want to apply this\n\n344\n00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:18.603\ntemplate, easiest way to do that\nwould be to come into your local GPO,\n\n345\n00:18:18.603 --> 00:18:21.641\nright click on Security Settings and\nnotice where I am,\n\n346\n00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:24.000\nlet's make sure we know where we are here.\n\n347\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.844\nAnd I can't click while\nI'm in this zoom mode.\n\n348\n00:18:27.844 --> 00:18:30.112\nI have to configure my\ntool a little bit better.\n\n349\n00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:34.033\nComputer Configuration &gt;\nWindows Settings &gt; Security Settings,\n\n350\n00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:38.302\nand I'm gonna right click on Security\nSettings and choose Import Policy.\n\n351\n00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:42.962\nAnd notice again that it defaults right to\nthat location which is why I always leave\n\n352\n00:18:42.962 --> 00:18:44.730\nmine in the default location.\n\n353\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.656\nMakes it really easy to\nfind them in the future.\n\n354\n00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:49.826\nI'll select that one,\nwe'll go ahead and click open.\n\n355\n00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:55.824\nAnd now if I go through the GPO settings,\nlocal policies, user rights assignment and\n\n356\n00:18:55.824 --> 00:19:01.171\nshut down the system, notice is says,\nlab Mike, because I've imported.\n\n357\n00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:03.653\nDid I not save that after we,\nyou know what?\n\n358\n00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:08.088\nI didn't save that template once we used\nthe security configuration analysis,\n\n359\n00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:09.790\nI never did save the template.\n\n360\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.788\nSo it doesn't have administrators and\nback up operators.\n\n361\n00:19:11.788 --> 00:19:16.723\nBut that's okay, I just wanted to show you\nthat another way to apply a template is to\n\n362\n00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:20.125\nimport it into a GPO and\nnow it's part of my group policy.\n\n363\n00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:21.764\nAnd this what I was saying,\n\n364\n00:19:21.764 --> 00:19:25.980\nyou might have somebody that you\ntrust enough to create the template.\n\n365\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.171\nYou want them to go through and\nconfigure those settings,\n\n366\n00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.303\nbut you don't want them working directly\nwith the GPO because you don't wanna make\n\n367\n00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.797\nthem an administrator on the machine.\n\n368\n00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:37.250\nI need to be an admin to get in here and\nwork with this local group policy editor.\n\n369\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.910\nWell, this person, while I want\nthem to configure the settings,\n\n370\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.140\nis not a local admin and\nI'm not making them a local admin.\n\n371\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.335\nSo they create the template, they tell me\nwhen they're done and then as an admin I\n\n372\n00:19:47.335 --> 00:19:51.486\ncan import that template into the GPO or\nthat local GPO to apply those settings.\n\n373\n00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:56.130\nSo that is what we've got on\nthe local side of things.\n\n374\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.610\nWe've got the local GPO, right?\n\n375\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.620\nWe've got our security template\nsnap-in that we can use.\n\n376\n00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.680\nWe've got our security configuration and\nanalysis tool that we can use.\n\n377\n00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.590\nAnd we can also configure\nthese settings directly.\n\n378\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.327\nLet's not forget that.\n\n379\n00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:15.770\nI can open up the properties from my\ndesktop and turn on the screen saver.\n\n380\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.307\nI could also go into the registry and\nmodify a registry entry there.\n\n381\n00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:21.000\nThat's what the local policy is doing,\nright?\n\n382\n00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.090\nWhatever I configure in this policy,\nwhen it applies, when I reboot the system,\n\n383\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.280\nwhen it applies periodically,\nit's just taking taking those settings and\n\n384\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.600\napplying them in the registry.\n\n385\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.680\nThis is just a way to make sure\nit's applied all the time and\n\n386\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.629\nconsistently by using a policy like this.\n\n387\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.040\nSo, good on the local land,\nnow I wanna scale it up.\n\n388\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.300\nBecause in a small shop,\nthis might work just fine.\n\n389\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.050\nOr for those one-off machines\nin your domain environment,\n\n390\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.380\nthis might work just fine.\n\n391\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.813\nBut when you've got hundreds or\nthousands of clients to configure And\n\n392\n00:20:50.813 --> 00:20:53.431\nnot all those clients are here with me,\nphysically,\n\n393\n00:20:53.431 --> 00:20:57.352\nsome of them are in our office across\nthe country or in another country, right?\n\n394\n00:20:57.352 --> 00:21:01.406\nI can't obviously run around and configure\neach one of those machines individually.\n\n395\n00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:04.130\nI've got hundreds of servers.\n\n396\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.654\nBut not all those servers reside\nphysically in the building here.\n\n397\n00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:12.000\nWhat's the easiest way or how do I\napply configurations to those guys?\n\n398\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.020\nThat is gonna be group policy again.\n\n399\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.840\nBut now we're gonna be doing it at the\ndomain level, rather than the local level.\n\n400\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.001\nRemember the local GPO only\napplies to this one machine.\n\n401\n00:21:23.001 --> 00:21:27.870\nAll right, so let's switch\nover to the domain controller.\n\n402\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.044\nI'm going to change machines,\njump over to my domain controller.\n\n403\n00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:34.483\nThis is where you're gonna work with\ngroup policy at the domain level,\n\n404\n00:21:34.483 --> 00:21:36.220\nis your domain controller.\n\n405\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.290\nThe one that's running the role of\nActive Directory, domain services.\n\n406\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.979\nSo, I'm gonna open up my tools and\nmy group policy management console.\n\n407\n00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:50.992\nAnd in here we're gonna find our policies.\n\n408\n00:21:50.992 --> 00:21:54.169\nI'm gonna expand my way\ndown in this console.\n\n409\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.682\nI expanded out forest, and then domains,\nand then the name of my domain,\n\n410\n00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:00.597\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n411\n00:22:00.597 --> 00:22:04.684\nAnd underneath there, I can see the\ndifferent organizational units that exist\n\n412\n00:22:04.684 --> 00:22:06.575\nwithin my active directory domain.\n\n413\n00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:10.760\nAnd this is where I can work\nwith policies and apply them.\n\n414\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.030\nThe great thing about these policies or\nat the domain levels, as I said earlier.\n\n415\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.430\nIt allows me to apply settings\nto a group of machines or\n\n416\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.670\nall of the machines or\na group of users or all of the users.\n\n417\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.100\nAnd let me be careful with the term,\ngroup.\n\n418\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.437\nWhat I mean when I say group I,\nI don't mean security group,\n\n419\n00:22:27.437 --> 00:22:28.950\nI mean like collection of.\n\n420\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:34.052\nFor example,\nI have an OU called Employees, and\n\n421\n00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:40.902\nin there there's a couple of OUs\ncalled Sales, and IT, and dev.\n\n422\n00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:45.774\nAnd if I wanna create a policy that\napplies to all employees whether\n\n423\n00:22:45.774 --> 00:22:49.863\nthey reside in the dev department,\nthe IT department or\n\n424\n00:22:49.863 --> 00:22:55.190\nsales department, I can link a group\npolicy object to the employees OU.\n\n425\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:23:02.220\nJust like the NTFS permissions, they will\ninherit down to the OUs that are nested\n\n426\n00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:07.220\ninside that OU, OU being organizational\nunit, if I didn't say that earlier.\n\n427\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.314\nBut let me just create a policy\nreal quick, just a blank one.\n\n428\n00:23:12.504 --> 00:23:13.723\nAnd I'll call it test3.\n\n429\n00:23:13.723 --> 00:23:16.134\nAgain, feeling super creative.\n\n430\n00:23:16.134 --> 00:23:19.119\nAnd, we'll go ahead and\ncreate that policy and\n\n431\n00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:22.570\nthen I'm gonna right click on it and\nchoose Edit.\n\n432\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.270\nAgain, for this exam, I know I'm going\na little quickly here, keep in mind,\n\n433\n00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.280\nthey're not expecting\nyou to create policies.\n\n434\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.095\nYou need to understand what is\nthe best tool to use given a scenario.\n\n435\n00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:36.010\nIf I've got one machine and\n\n436\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.140\nit's not part of a domain, then probably\nthe local policy is a good way to go or\n\n437\n00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.280\nthe security configuration analysis or\nsecurity templates.\n\n438\n00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.400\nIf I need to configure multiple\nmachines that are part of a domain,\n\n439\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.019\nthen a domain based GPO and\n\n440\n00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:54.597\nthe group policy management console is\nprobably going to be the way to go.\n\n441\n00:23:54.597 --> 00:23:56.862\nSo to this edit policy I just\nwanna show you couple of things.\n\n442\n00:23:56.862 --> 00:24:01.899\nI'm gonna expand out Policies,\nI'm going to expand out Windows settings.\n\n443\n00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:07.429\nAnd I'll go down into eventually\nas it expands out here.\n\n444\n00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:12.700\nJust thinking about it\nas it locks up on me.\n\n445\n00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.335\nBasically what I wanna show you, there we\ngo and I'll go into security settings, and\n\n446\n00:24:17.335 --> 00:24:20.960\nthese should look really\nfamiliar once it opens up.\n\n447\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.870\nJust thinking about it.\n\n448\n00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.140\nUsually, every time you go into a GPO like\nthis and the first time you expand this\n\n449\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:31.480\nout, it takes a minute for it to read all\nof this but hopefully not too much longer.\n\n450\n00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.360\nLet's get back out, there we go.\n\n451\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.890\nAnd I'll zoom back in, and\nyou'll a lot of the same settings.\n\n452\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.920\nAccount policies, local policies,\nevent log, restricted groups,\n\n453\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.110\nsystem service, registry file.\n\n454\n00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.890\nWe've seen all those.\n\n455\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.850\nThose were in our security template,\nright?\n\n456\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.100\nThere's additional settings in\nhere in this domain-based policy.\n\n457\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.120\nBut I can do the same thing\nwe did at the local level.\n\n458\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.010\nI can right-click on Security Settings,\nand choose Import Policy.\n\n459\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.600\nNow the policies on that other machine,\nI don't have it here so\n\n460\n00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.560\nI can't actually import it\ncuz I don't have it here.\n\n461\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.820\nBut the option is there, right?\n\n462\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.350\nSo the same thing.\n\n463\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.080\nI've got people that I trust enough\nto create these templates, but\n\n464\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.430\nthey're not the main administrators.\n\n465\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.130\nI don't want them working\nwith group policy directly.\n\n466\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.600\nSo I can allow them to create\nthose templates, test them,\n\n467\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.940\nwhatever they need to do.\n\n468\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.080\nSubmit them.\n\n469\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.630\nOnce they've been tested, now I can\napply into my production environment.\n\n470\n00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.450\nI can import them into a GPO,\nand link it to the entire domain.\n\n471\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.340\nAnd it will now apply to every single\nmachine, in the entire domain.\n\n472\n00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.134\nOr maybe I just want to\nlink it to the dev OU.\n\n473\n00:25:33.134 --> 00:25:36.443\nSo it only applies to the computers\nin the dev department.\n\n474\n00:25:36.443 --> 00:25:40.691\nThat's the great thing about domain\nbased group policy objects is,\n\n475\n00:25:40.691 --> 00:25:43.117\nwe get to do what we\ncall a scope on a GPO.\n\n476\n00:25:43.117 --> 00:25:47.080\nIf you see that term, scoping a policy,\nthey're talking about, what is the scope?\n\n477\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.240\nWho does that policy apply to?\n\n478\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.181\nEverybody?\n\n479\n00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:52.468\nJust the managers?\n\n480\n00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:54.872\nJust the computers in the test lab?\n\n481\n00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:57.263\nAll the computers in\nthe San Fransisco office?\n\n482\n00:25:57.263 --> 00:25:58.860\nAll the computers in Australia?\n\n483\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.310\nWhatever the case may be\nwe can use filters and\n\n484\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:07.070\ndifferent ways to control who\nthis policy actually applies to.\n\n485\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.900\nWho or whom, or whatever\nthe proper English there would be.\n\n486\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.380\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you've showed us\nthat some of these policies and\n\n487\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.390\nthe various settings can be very complex.\n\n488\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.670\nAnd you also said that maybe in certain\nenvironments, you don't want people\n\n489\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.806\nmodifying the policies, just for\npermissions or authority if you will.\n\n490\n00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:25.801\nNow is there a way that if I don't\nwanna open one of these policies, and\n\n491\n00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:30.342\nlook through the tedious task of which\nsettings are turned on, maybe enabled,\n\n492\n00:26:30.342 --> 00:26:31.241\nnot disabled.\n\n493\n00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:34.944\nDo we have a way, regardless of whether\nit's group policy at a domain, or\n\n494\n00:26:34.944 --> 00:26:38.960\nit's a local group policy, if you will,\nin which we can see the results?\n\n495\n00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, a couple of, tricky.\n\n496\n00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.070\nThere is, and there isn't.\n\n497\n00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.730\nIt depends on what you're referring to.\n\n498\n00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.210\nIf I wanna see what policies have\napplied to a particular machine, I can.\n\n499\n00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.170\nI can use group policy result, and\n\n500\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.340\nwe'll actually show you that\nin the next episode here.\n\n501\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.740\nI think we're gonna have\nto come back anyway.\n\n502\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.760\nSo, I'll show you how to look at that.\n\n503\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.210\nIf you wanna see the settings that\nare configured within an individual GPO,\n\n504\n00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.010\nthat's a little different.\n\n505\n00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.800\nYou do that through\nthe Group Policy Management Console,\n\n506\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.260\nthat I can show you right\nnow while we're here.\n\n507\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.080\nLet's configure some,\nwell here I'll tell you what,\n\n508\n00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.950\nI'll just use one that's\nalready configured.\n\n509\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.600\nI've got my default domain policy here,\nand\n\n510\n00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.320\nin a GPO there are literally thousands,\nwhen we get into the domain based GPO's,\n\n511\n00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.230\nthere are thousands of settings, right?\n\n512\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.220\nNow somebody else made this policy, right?\n\n513\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.300\nI'm probably not the only admin,\n\n514\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.830\nI don't know what settings are configured\nwithin that group policy object.\n\n515\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.270\nHow could I find out?\n\n516\n00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.252\nWell, I can select it, and\nthen go to the settings tab over here.\n\n517\n00:27:39.252 --> 00:27:43.120\nAnd it'll generate a report and\nfilter it down, so\n\n518\n00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.670\nthat I get to see not all\nthousands of the settings.\n\n519\n00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.121\nBut just the ones that\nare actually configured, and\n\n520\n00:27:49.121 --> 00:27:50.574\nwhat they're configured to.\n\n521\n00:27:50.574 --> 00:27:55.230\nSo its a great little report so you can\nsee hey what is included in that GPO?\n\n522\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.780\nAnd as I said earlier at the beginning of\nthis episode, I do wanna show you actually\n\n523\n00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.459\na couple of important settings that you'll\nfind in the GPO that are security related.\n\n524\n00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:07.814\nAnd we can take a look at seeing how those\nor talk about how they're applied and\n\n525\n00:28:07.814 --> 00:28:10.055\nverifying that they're applied.\n\n526\n00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:12.503\n&gt;&gt; Very good and\nI love setting us up for cliffhangers.\n\n527\n00:28:12.503 --> 00:28:13.348\nThat's amazing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:28:13.348 --> 00:28:14.034\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike,\n\n529\n00:28:14.034 --> 00:28:17.882\nit does look like we are coming to\nthe end of another episode, but,\n\n530\n00:28:17.882 --> 00:28:22.694\nsince we do have a cliffhanger in play, do\nyou wanna go ahead and save everything for\n\n531\n00:28:22.694 --> 00:28:24.260\na part two on this one?\n\n532\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.040\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do.\n\n533\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n534\n00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.420\nWell, that's a perfect place to go ahead\nand take the time to wrap this one up.\n\n535\n00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.610\nMike, we appreciate you, as always,\nbeing here in the studio with us.\n\n536\n00:28:32.610 -->

two.\n\n539\n00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.730\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n540\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n541\n00:28:40.680 -->

00:00:11.850\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.040\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.220\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our GIAC Security Fundamentals,\n\n7\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.540\nalso known as GSEC.\n\n8\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.650\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\na part two is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.190\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.400\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.190\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.220\nGlad to be back and\ncontinuing on, as you say.\n\n13\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.120\nWe were actually talking about\ngroup policy and templates.\n\n14\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.320\nSo we're just gonna continue on.\n\n15\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.050\nIn fact, Wes, you had asked a question\nthere at the end of the previous episode,\n\n16\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.540\ndidn't have time to get to it.\n\n17\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.535\nSo let's start with that.\n\n18\n00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:45.095\nYou had asked,\ndo you remember your question?\n\n19\n00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:48.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things I was thinking\nis with all the different settings that we\n\n20\n00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.291\nhave inside of group policy, is there\nare way that we can look at the settings?\n\n21\n00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.885\nAnd then, in the end, is there a way that\nI can maybe even test my machine and\n\n22\n00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.945\nfind out what settings\nare going on in my machine?\n\n23\n00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.877\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and that's a very\nimportant part of working with policy is\n\n24\n00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:01.695\nmaking sure the policies are applied,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.980\nAnd we said one of the conveniences of\ngroup policy object at the domain level\n\n26\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.660\nIs that I can apply a policy\nat the domain or OU level and\n\n27\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.240\nhave it affect multiple machines,\nlike very machine in the domain or\n\n28\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.370\njust the machine in the sales department,\nor what have you.\n\n29\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.050\nBut I do need to verify\nthat that's working, right?\n\n30\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.363\nI wanna make sure those\nthings are applied.\n\n31\n00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:24.298\nOr maybe I've got a policy that, I don't\nknow, maps some network drives, and\n\n32\n00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:28.292\nI've got a user that calls up and says you\nknow I don't have these drives mapped,\n\n33\n00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:29.438\neverybody else does.\n\n34\n00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:30.600\nAnd you see why.\n\n35\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.860\nIs that policy applying?\n\n36\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.780\nSo let me show you couple\nways we can work with that.\n\n37\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.960\nI'm gonna flip back over\nto the client machine.\n\n38\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.729\nSo on my Windows 10 box here, and\nI'm gonna open up a command prompt.\n\n39\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.240\nAnd we're gonna adjust that font so\nthat my old eyes can see it,\n\n40\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.590\nwhich will probably help\nyour eyes out there as well.\n\n41\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.034\nWe'll do a couple of adjustments here.\n\n42\n00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.393\nGet that setup.\n\n43\n00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:59.880\nThere we go,\nthat should be a little better.\n\n44\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.068\nAnd the command that you wanna use,\nif you're testing,\n\n45\n00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:08.604\nif you wanna see what policies\nare being applied to a machine,\n\n46\n00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:12.370\nyou do GP result space forward slash R,\nall right?\n\n47\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340\nAnd what this gives me, I'll scroll\nback up to where I ran the command.\n\n48\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.650\nSo here is my command right here, and\nyou'll see here what's called an RSoP.\n\n49\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.040\nRSoP, good term to know,\nResultant Set of Policy.\n\n50\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.850\nAll the policies are applied,\nwhat is the resultant set?\n\n51\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.420\nAnd then it does give me some\ninformation about the machine itself.\n\n52\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.340\nAnd then I can see there's\na computer portion.\n\n53\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.830\nAnd I can see, again, a little bit\nof information about the machine.\n\n54\n00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.950\nAnd then which policies are being applied.\n\n55\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.260\nWell, my default domain policy is being\napplied, and my reg modification.\n\n56\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.640\nI think that was one we had created\nearlier in one of our previous episodes\n\n57\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.920\nis being applied to this machine.\n\n58\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.470\nAlso says the following GPOs were not\napplied cuz they were filtered out.\n\n59\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.326\nThe local group policy\nis not being applied.\n\n60\n00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:01.290\nIt says because it's empty.\n\n61\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.110\nWe didn't ever actually make any changes\nto it when we were playing around with it\n\n62\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.150\nin the previous episode, or\nat least not computer settings.\n\n63\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.420\nAnd then, as I scroll down,\nthen there's a user settings portion, and\n\n64\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.550\nit really repeats.\n\n65\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.290\nThere's the local group policy being\napplied, cuz one of the settings we did\n\n66\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.690\nconfigure was under the user\nhalf of those policy settings.\n\n67\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.610\nSo GP result is the command you would use\nto see what policies were being applied.\n\n68\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.100\nYou could pipe that out to\na text file if you needed to.\n\n69\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.710\nOr we could just view it\nright there on the screen.\n\n70\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.270\nWe can actually pipe it\nout to an HTML file.\n\n71\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.800\nAnd it makes a really nice report that\nyou could turn in as a deliverable\n\n72\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.379\nif you needed to go sit in a meeting or\nsomething like that.\n\n73\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.950\nAll right, so let's see.\n\n74\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.730\nNext thing I wanna do is take\na look at some of the settings.\n\n75\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.725\nAs I said at the beginning\nof the previous episode,\n\n76\n00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:53.610\nit's not important that we understand\nevery single setting in a GPR.\n\n77\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.150\nI have been doing this for\nclose 15 years and\n\n78\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.275\nI don't know every single setting in\nthe thousands of settings in there.\n\n79\n00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:04.278\nHalf of them I'll never use,\nthe other half you just Google or Bing it,\n\n80\n00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:05.757\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n81\n00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:07.305\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n82\n00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:12.430\nThey do have great descriptions built\nin to the group policy console.\n\n83\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.417\nBut there are a couple, when it\ncomes to security classes like this,\n\n84\n00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:18.780\nthat I do feel are worth pointing out\nto make sure we know where they are.\n\n85\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.620\nThey could ask you on an exam\nwhat's the best way to\n\n86\n00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.160\nconfigure a password policy in a domain\nenvironment with Windows machines, right?\n\n87\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.050\nAnd you need to know\nwhere those settings are.\n\n88\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.160\nSo let's go back over to\nthe domain controller, DC1.\n\n89\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.300\nAnd I'm going to actually edit\nthe default domain policy.\n\n90\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.480\nAnd in this default domain policy,\nunderneath the computer configuration, I'm\n\n91\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.883\ngonna extend out policies and then Windows\nsettings, and then security setting.\n\n92\n00:04:46.883 --> 00:04:49.480\nWe've been here a couple of times, right?\n\n93\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.740\nAnd then, underneath that,\nlet me broaden this a little bit.\n\n94\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.952\nI've got my account policies,\nand we take a look at there.\n\n95\n00:04:55.952 --> 00:05:00.860\nI've got password policy, account\nlockout policy, and Kerberos policy.\n\n96\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.950\nThose are the ones I really\njust wanna make sure we know,\n\n97\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.840\none, where they are, and what the actual\nsettings within there accomplish for me.\n\n98\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.430\nSo let's take a look at those.\n\n99\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.070\nAll right,\nwe'll start with the password policy, and\n\n100\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.040\nthere are several settings in here.\n\n101\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.490\nThere's enforce password history.\n\n102\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.914\nWhat you're seeing on the left is the name\nof the setting that I can double-click on.\n\n103\n00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:24.010\nIf I wanted to change one of these,\nI would just double-click on it, and\n\n104\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.030\nconfigure it's value, right?\n\n105\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.090\nWhat you're seeing here is\nwhat it's currently set to.\n\n106\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.520\nAnd I have not changed anything.\n\n107\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.460\nThese are the default settings for\na Windows domain, all right?\n\n108\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.520\nThis is the way it comes out of the box or\n\n109\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.480\nwhen you install active\ndirectory domain services.\n\n110\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.280\nEnforce password history,\n24 passwords remembered.\n\n111\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.180\nWhat that means is it's gonna keep track\nof the passwords your users are using\n\n112\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.780\non a per user basis.\n\n113\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.540\nAnd it will not allow them to repeat or\n\n114\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.590\nto reuse a password that's been used\none of previous 23 times, all right?\n\n115\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.057\nSo it's gonna remember the last 24\nused passwords you've used, and\n\n116\n00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:01.635\nit won't let you re-use them.\n\n117\n00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:03.075\nWhy?\n\n118\n00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:05.027\nBecause we know how our end users are.\n\n119\n00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:06.870\nWe're end users ourselves, right?\n\n120\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.625\nAnd we have our favorite password that\nwe like to use, and whatever your\n\n121\n00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:15.336\ncompany's policy is every 30 days every 42\ndays, I have to go to change my password.\n\n122\n00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:18.606\nNow, I've gotta remember a new password or\nwrite it down a sticky note and\n\n123\n00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:19.910\ntape it to my monitor.\n\n124\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.640\nNo, don't do that, I'm kidding.\n\n125\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.530\nBut I do have to change my password,\nand we do that for very good reasons.\n\n126\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.160\nBut what our end users like to do is\nchange it to the same password, right?\n\n127\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.940\nMy password was blue, it's time to\nchange it, I'm gonna make it blue.\n\n128\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.260\nIf you weren't remembering the passwords\nthat they had used previously,\n\n129\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.180\nthe system wouldn't know, and\nit would let them do that.\n\n130\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.410\nIt would say you changed it to blue,\ngreat for you, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.800\nSo now, they won't be able to use,\n\n132\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.910\nthey'll have to change their\npassword to something else.\n\n133\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.976\nNow, granted, they'll probably add a one\nto the end of their favorite password, but\n\n134\n00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.200\nthat's another story.\n\n135\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.000\nThat's user education,\nand we'll talk about that.\n\n136\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.970\nSo enforce password history,\non by default.\n\n137\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.740\nIt's gonna remember the last\n24 passwords you've used.\n\n138\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.070\nMinimum, or, I'm sorry,\nmaximum password age.\n\n139\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.080\nThis is how often you have\nto change your password.\n\n140\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.317\nThe default, as you can see here,\nis 24, I'm sorry, 42 days.\n\n141\n00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:17.948\nSo every 42 days, my users are gonna\nget prompted to change their password,\n\n142\n00:07:17.948 --> 00:07:19.570\nall right?\n\n143\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.370\nMinimum password age.\n\n144\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.660\nHow old the password has to\nbe before you can change it.\n\n145\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.490\nNow that's an odd one.\n\n146\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.210\nThis is one that most people go wait,\nwhat?\n\n147\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.170\nEverybody understands every 30 days\nI've got to change my password, that\n\n148\n00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.320\nmaximum password age, or every 42 days by\ndefault I've got to change my password.\n\n149\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.340\nBut minimum password age?\n\n150\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.740\nWhat does will prevent you from doing\nis if you change your password,\n\n151\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.960\nits 9am on a Monday morning,\nI change my password.\n\n152\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.770\nAnd then, after lunch I decide,\nyou know what,\n\n153\n00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.460\nthat's gonna be a hard one to remember.\n\n154\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.010\nI'm gonna change it again.\n\n155\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.000\nNo, you're not.\n\n156\n00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.520\nBecause it has to be at least 24 hours\nsince your last password change, right?\n\n157\n00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.360\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you just shot me down there, man,\ncuz you said 24 passwords remembering.\n\n158\n00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.767\nI'm like, yeah, I'm gonna bypass that.\n\n159\n00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:01.852\nI'll just sit here and Ctrl+Alt+Del.\n\n160\n00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:03.609\nI'm gonna change it 25th time.\n\n161\n00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:06.347\nIt's going back to blue or\nblue1 And I have just completely\n\n162\n00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:09.233\nbypassed your policy\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly why they have that\n\n163\n00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:12.808\nsetting, because the end users\nwho can't figure out how to print\n\n164\n00:08:12.808 --> 00:08:15.278\nthey're spreadsheet in landscape format,\n\n165\n00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:18.360\ncan figure out how to bypass\nthe security policies.\n\n166\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.330\nIt's the most amazing\nthing I've ever seen.\n\n167\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.309\nSo if you tell them, if they figure\nout that it's remembering the last 24\n\n168\n00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:28.668\npasswords, they will change their password\n25 times in a row to get back to their\n\n169\n00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:31.212\nfavorite password, guaranteed, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:34.812\nSo the main password it says, hey,\nyou can't change it for 24 hours.\n\n171\n00:08:34.812 --> 00:08:39.660\nSo we can play with these settings and\nif you have to change it every 30 days and\n\n172\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.940\nI remember the last 30 passwords,\nall right, did I do that right?\n\n173\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.950\nYou can get to the point where,\nthey can only change it once a day, right?\n\n174\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.920\nBecause remember the minimum\npassword age is one day.\n\n175\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.790\nSo they'll have to change it, wait a day,\nchange it, wait a day, change it,\n\n176\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.700\nwait a day.\n\n177\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.340\nIf I'm remembering 30 passwords,\nif they get to that 30th day,\n\n178\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.140\nthey can finally get back\nto their favorite password.\n\n179\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.410\nBut guess what?\n\n180\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.738\nIt's time to change your password again.\n\n181\n00:09:02.738 --> 00:09:05.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me go ahead and\njust follow that trail of logic.\n\n182\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.690\nAnd your password policy that you're\nstarting to enforce here, wouldn't that\n\n183\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.650\nmean it would take the 25th day before\nI can get back to my password to blue?\n\n184\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n185\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n186\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.850\nSo you get maximum,\nhow often you have to change it,\n\n187\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.000\nminimum, how long you have to wait\nbefore you can change it again.\n\n188\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.300\nThe only negative of that one though is,\nif I've got a user,\n\n189\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.790\nlet's say I'm changing my password and\nafter I change it, I look up and\n\n190\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.720\nI realize that Wes is standing over my\nshoulder, staring intently at my keyboard.\n\n191\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.110\nHe probably just watched\nme change my password and\n\n192\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.810\nthere's a good chance he\nknows what I changed it to.\n\n193\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.610\nNow I need to change it again\nbecause I don't trust Wes, but\n\n194\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.760\nthe policy won't let me.\n\n195\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.130\nThis is when I'm gonna need\nto go to an administrator and\n\n196\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.800\nthey're gonna have to allow\nme to change it again.\n\n197\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.120\nThey can allow me to do that.\n\n198\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.820\nAll right, so\n\n199\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.680\nthat's the one downside of that is\nif somebody thinks they're password\n\n200\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.870\nchange has been compromised, then they're\ngonna have trouble changing it again.\n\n201\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.610\nThe next one down, minimum password\nlength, pretty self-explanatory.\n\n202\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.400\nHow many characters long does\nyour password have to be?\n\n203\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.200\nWe all know the longer the password\nthe stronger the password.\n\n204\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.440\nSeven characters is the default.\n\n205\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.470\nMost organizations will bump\nthat up at least eight.\n\n206\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.530\nIt makes a huge difference, all right?\n\n207\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.010\nIt makes a really big difference.\n\n208\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.400\nRemember we were doing binary and\nhexadecimal the other day, and\n\n209\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.930\nwe were doing some formulas\nwhere if I wanted to figure out\n\n210\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.980\nhow many possibilities, for binary,\nit was 2 to the number of bits.\n\n211\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.593\nSo if I had two bits,\nit's 2 to the power 2 which gave me a 4,\n\n212\n00:10:36.593 --> 00:10:38.770\nthere's 4 possibilities.\n\n213\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.166\nI can do the same thing here, there's\nabout 96 possibilities per character\n\n214\n00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:47.496\nin your password, if you're using all\navailable characters, upper case,\n\n215\n00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.182\nlower case, numbers and\nspecial characters.\n\n216\n00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:55.089\nSo a seven character password is\nthe number of unique possibilities,\n\n217\n00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:57.176\nis actually 96 to the 7th.\n\n218\n00:10:57.176 --> 00:11:00.586\nThat will tell you how many unique\npasswords you can come up with,\n\n219\n00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:01.896\nwith seven characters.\n\n220\n00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:07.383\n96 to the 7th versus 96 to the 8th.\n\n221\n00:11:07.383 --> 00:11:11.687\nIf it was an eight character password,\nit's a huge difference because you're\n\n222\n00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:15.900\nbasically taking the answer to\nthe first one, 96 to the 7th, times 96.\n\n223\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.180\nSo you're multiplying\nthe entire thing times 96.\n\n224\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.240\nSo it's an exponential growth.\n\n225\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.290\nSo by making them use one more character\nin your password, it's becoming much,\n\n226\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.810\nmuch stronger.\n\n227\n00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.150\nBut again, that's really beyond\nwhat we need to know here.\n\n228\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.345\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to go ahead and\njump ahead of you on this one, Mike.\n\n229\n00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.585\nCuz I do see the next one\nthat's coming up on the list.\n\n230\n00:11:33.585 --> 00:11:35.915\nAnd it says something about\ncomplexity requirements.\n\n231\n00:11:35.915 --> 00:11:39.945\nCan you give me an explanation of\nwhat makes a password complex?\n\n232\n00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:41.705\nWhat is the complexity part of that?\n\n233\n00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:43.692\n&gt;&gt; It's, well, let's clarify.\n\n234\n00:11:43.692 --> 00:11:45.760\nWe wanna make sure we're saying\nin a Windows environment.\n\n235\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.670\nWhat makes it complex to Windows?\n\n236\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.040\nBecause talk to other people and they'll\nhave a different definition for you,\n\n237\n00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.570\nas far as what complexity is.\n\n238\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.690\nBut really when we talk about a complex\npassword, there's one thing that I think\n\n239\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.890\neverybody agrees on,\nis it's a mix of characters, right?\n\n240\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.410\nNot just using lower case\nalphabetical characters.\n\n241\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.880\nBy throwing in some numbers,\n\n242\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.070\nby throwing in some upper case letters,\nby throwing in some special characters,\n\n243\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.700\npound symbol, ampersand, things like that,\nwe're making it complex.\n\n244\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.260\nAnd the idea is there are lots of tools\nout there that will allow people to break\n\n245\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.180\npasswords, to guess passwords.\n\n246\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.860\nAnd if you're just using letters, there's\nonly 26 possibilities per character,\n\n247\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.390\nA through Z.\n\n248\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.140\nAnd so\nthat's not a very big character set,\n\n249\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.930\nit's not gonna take me that long\nto go through all the different\n\n250\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.300\npossibilities especially if I'm using\nsome automated tool to do this.\n\n251\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.130\nComputers can do billions\nof guesses per second.\n\n252\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.890\nSo it's not gonna take them long.\n\n253\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.720\nThat's why we want to\nintroduce complexity,\n\n254\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.470\nwe want to make sure we're using\nmore than one character set.\n\n255\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.360\nAnd in Windows environment, you have\nuppercase letters, lowercase letters,\n\n256\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.790\nthere's 26 of each, right?\n\n257\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.916\nWe've got numbers, so\nthere's gonna be 10 of those, 0 through 9.\n\n258\n00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:59.461\nAnd then special characters there's\nright around 32, I believe,\n\n259\n00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:02.476\npossible special characters\nthat I can use in my password.\n\n260\n00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:04.816\nAnd that's where I got\nthat number 96 earlier.\n\n261\n00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:10.400\nI don't know if my math was exact but\n26 plus 26 plus 10 plus 32, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.260\nSo in Windows, when you enable\ncomplexity with this policy here,\n\n263\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.710\nwhat Windows is gonna make sure that\nyou do when you generate a password is\n\n264\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.288\nthat three of the four character sets\nare represented in your password.\n\n265\n00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:28.916\nSo in your password, you must have\na mixture of either say, uppercase,\n\n266\n00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:32.055\nlowercase and numbers, or\nlowercase and numbers and\n\n267\n00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:35.584\nspecial characters, or uppercase and\nnumbers and special characters.\n\n268\n00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:37.810\nYou can still use all four,\nwhich you should.\n\n269\n00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.330\nYou should have uppercase,\nlowercase and numbers and\n\n270\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.020\nspecial characters in your password.\n\n271\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.740\nBut what Windows is going to enforce\nis that you've used at least\n\n272\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.100\nof the character sets.\n\n273\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.220\nIf you try to make a password with\njust uppercase and lowercase letters,\n\n274\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.090\nWindows is gonna say no, that is not\ncomplex enough, try again, all right?\n\n275\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.510\nSo definitely important.\n\n276\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.440\nBetween complexity and length,\n\n277\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.960\nthose are the two biggest things that\nI can do to make a strong password.\n\n278\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.010\nWell, there is the not use\nactual words rule as well.\n\n279\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.750\nSo there's a couple other things\nthat we'll talk about later.\n\n280\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:17.400\nBut those two things right there really\nincrease the strength of a password.\n\n281\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.980\nAnd these are two things that I\ncan do through policy, right?\n\n282\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.750\nOther things I do, I have to teach my\nusers how to create strong passwords by\n\n283\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.420\nnot using words that are found in\nthe dictionary, using pass phrases and\n\n284\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.310\nthings like that.\n\n285\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.730\n&gt;&gt; But as far as policy goes,\nthese are two things that I can affect,\n\n286\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.430\nthe length and the complexity\nof those passwords, all right?\n\n287\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.930\nThe last one is store passwords\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n288\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.550\nAnd notice that it's disabled by default.\n\n289\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.770\nAnd if I didn't mention it, you probably\nsaw it, complexity is enabled by default.\n\n290\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.030\nMinimum password length is going\nto be seven characters by default.\n\n291\n00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.860\nStore password using reversal\nencryption is disabled by default.\n\n292\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.760\nAnd there is a good reason for that.\n\n293\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.670\nWhat that means is, well, let's talk\nabout what happens normally first and\n\n294\n00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.970\nthen we'll talk about the setting.\n\n295\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.020\nWhen you create a password and it gets\nstored in the active directory database,\n\n296\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.660\nit's not storing your actual password.\n\n297\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.560\nIt's storing an encrypted representation\nof your password, it's something known as\n\n298\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.650\na hash value, which we'll talk about when\nwe get into our encryption episodes.\n\n299\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.580\nBut it's a hash value that\nrepresents your password basically.\n\n300\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.258\nAnd that hash,\none of the cool things about hash values,\n\n301\n00:15:29.258 --> 00:15:32.250\nis they're not reversible.\n\n302\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:37.260\nIf somebody was to steal that database and\nsee your hash value that's stored\n\n303\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.700\nwhere your password goes, they can't\nreverse that and get your password out.\n\n304\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.240\nIt's not like your super secret little\ndecoder ring where I could reverse it and\n\n305\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.270\nget the original text back out.\n\n306\n00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.030\nOnce you hash something,\nyou can't turn around and get it back out.\n\n307\n00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.040\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n308\n00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.920\nThat's security, right?\n\n309\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.339\nI don't want somebody to be able\nto take that database home and\n\n310\n00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:00.982\nget all my users passwords out of there,\nokay?\n\n311\n00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:05.790\nBut there are some applications, some\nauthentication protocols that need that.\n\n312\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.520\nThat don't, they can't use\nthe hashed version of your password.\n\n313\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.910\nThey need to know what\nyour actual password is.\n\n314\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.020\nCHAP is one of them, Challenge\nHandshake Authentication Protocol.\n\n315\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.320\nIt needs the plain text version, the human\nreadable version of your password.\n\n316\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.560\nSo, if we're using applications\nthat rely on CHAP,\n\n317\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.830\nwhen we store the password in\nActive Directory, we need to change it.\n\n318\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.720\nWe need to make sure we store\nit as reversible encryption.\n\n319\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.500\nSomething that I can reverse to get\nthe original password back out.\n\n320\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.930\nBut by doing that, I'm actually\nreducing security on my network,\n\n321\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.430\nnot making it stronger.\n\n322\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.490\nWhich is why it's disabled by default.\n\n323\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.190\nAnd which is why we should only enable\nit if we're using an application,\n\n324\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.260\nif we're using something like CHAP,\nwhere it requires that.\n\n325\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.740\nMe, personally, I would say, hey,\nlet's look for something else.\n\n326\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.090\nLet's see if we can do it without CHAP or\n\n327\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.270\nwithout whatever it is that needs\nthat reversal of encryption.\n\n328\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.143\nBut you might not be able to.\n\n329\n00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:02.305\nThere might be a cross-platform scenario\nwhere you've got this other OS or\n\n330\n00:17:02.305 --> 00:17:04.100\nsomething that doesn't work.\n\n331\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.170\nAnd then, you have to use CHAP,\nand you need to turn this on.\n\n332\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.630\nBut just keep in mind,\nonly turn it on when necessary.\n\n333\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.650\nIt's not increasing\nsecurity by turning it on.\n\n334\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.020\nIt's actually decreasing\nsecurity by turning it on.\n\n335\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.170\nAll right, so,\nthose are our password policies.\n\n336\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.232\nThe next thing I wanna talk about is\nthe Account Lockout Policy settings,\n\n337\n00:17:23.232 --> 00:17:23.894\nall right?\n\n338\n00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:26.000\nSo, let's zoom in on this one here.\n\n339\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000\nI just want a one down\nfrom password policy,\n\n340\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.960\nyou can see it on the left there,\nto the Account Lockout Policies.\n\n341\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.650\nThis is not turned on by default.\n\n342\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.000\nThere's three settings in\nhere that we can deal with.\n\n343\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.906\nThere's the Account lockout threshold,\nthe Account lockout duration,\n\n344\n00:17:40.906 --> 00:17:43.335\nand the Reset account\nlockout counter after.\n\n345\n00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:45.490\nThat's a mouthful there, all right.\n\n346\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.070\nTwo of them are not defined,\nyou'll see the first and the last.\n\n347\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.678\nThe Account lockout duration and\n\n348\n00:17:49.678 --> 00:17:52.820\nReset account lockout counter\nafter are not defined.\n\n349\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.384\nBecause if the Account lockout\nisn't turned on, then,\n\n350\n00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:59.663\nthose two settings don't do anything,\nall right?\n\n351\n00:17:59.663 --> 00:18:03.174\nThe one in the middle is how we\nactually turn on the Account lockout.\n\n352\n00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:05.510\nNow, what the heck is Account lockout?\n\n353\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.145\nAccount lockout is when I,\nwhich is a good way to say this?\n\n354\n00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:15.288\nWhen I want them to prevent\npassword guessing, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:18.393\nIf you go up to a machine and\nyou type in a wrong password,\n\n356\n00:18:18.393 --> 00:18:21.120\nthat's a failed authentication.\n\n357\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.120\nAnd if I get repeated\nfailed authentications,\n\n358\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.390\nthere's a couple of things\nthat could be going on.\n\n359\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.880\nCould be that my user\nforgot their password and\n\n360\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.490\nthey're [LAUGH] trying to guess and trying\nto type something, and they're like,\n\n361\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.910\nI think I remember what I changed it to,\nand they're just attempting to log in.\n\n362\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.880\nThat could be one reason for multiple\nfailed authentication attempts on account.\n\n363\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.170\nBut a more likely scenario is that\nsomebody's password guessing.\n\n364\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.520\nSomebody's trying to break in.\n\n365\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.918\nI, Wes, is gone,\nI'm sitting down in his machine.\n\n366\n00:18:48.918 --> 00:18:53.015\nI know his username because our whole\ncompany uses first name dot last name.\n\n367\n00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:53.982\nBut I don't know what's his password is.\n\n368\n00:18:53.982 --> 00:18:56.196\nI'm just gonna sit here and\nfire off guesses.\n\n369\n00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.620\nI know Wes like knife.\n\n370\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.915\nSo, I might type in knife or switch blade.\n\n371\n00:18:59.915 --> 00:19:01.740\nI know he likes Star Wars.\n\n372\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.691\nSo, I might type in Skywalker or\nDarth Vader.\n\n373\n00:19:04.691 --> 00:19:08.620\nAnd I'm just gonna guess some things that\nI think Wes might use as a password.\n\n374\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.540\nEach one of those would\nbe a failed attempt.\n\n375\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.900\nBut by default,\nthe system's not gonna stop it.\n\n376\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.100\nIt's gonna let me guess and\nguess and guess and guess.\n\n377\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.510\nAnd hopefully, well, I guess it depends on\nwhat side of the fence you're sitting on.\n\n378\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.928\nAs far as the bad actor goes, I hope I get\nit right eventually and I log in as Wes.\n\n379\n00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.700\nAs a system admin,\nyou're hoping I never get it right.\n\n380\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.709\nWell, how about we just don't\nlet that happen at all?\n\n381\n00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.042\nHow about we say, you know what?\n\n382\n00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:33.885\nLet's limit the amount of time somebody\ncan type in a bad password before we just\n\n383\n00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:36.650\nsay, this account is now locked.\n\n384\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.100\nIt's not gonna be allowed to authenticate.\n\n385\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.150\nWhether you get the password right or not,\nthe account itself is now disabled and\n\n386\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.500\nyou're not gonna be able\nto access anything, right?\n\n387\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.020\nThat's what the Account\nlockout is all about.\n\n388\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.340\nBy default, it's set to zero, which means\nyou can guess an infinite number of\n\n389\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.598\ntimes and\nit's not gonna lock the account out.\n\n390\n00:19:53.598 --> 00:19:58.100\nAll we're gonna do is admins is\ncoming here and turn that setting on.\n\n391\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.836\nWe're gonna double click on it, and\n\n392\n00:19:59.836 --> 00:20:02.703\nwe're gonna make sure we check\nto find this policy setting.\n\n393\n00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:07.655\nAnd we're gonna set this to say,\n5, then, click Apply.\n\n394\n00:20:07.655 --> 00:20:11.340\nNow, once you turn that setting on,\nyou're enabling Account lockout.\n\n395\n00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.570\nThe other two settings now come into play,\nthey have meaning.\n\n396\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.200\nI'm gonna to leave them at their default,\nwhich is 30 minutes, and\n\n397\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.520\nthen, I\"ll explain what\nthe heck they mean.\n\n398\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.650\nSo, I'll click OK, and\nthen, I'll click OK.\n\n399\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.900\nSo, now, five invalid log on attempts and\nthe account is gonna lock.\n\n400\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.353\nSo, if I guess five passwords and none of\nthem are right, the account is now locked.\n\n401\n00:20:30.353 --> 00:20:32.050\nI'm not gonna be able to guess anymore.\n\n402\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.780\nSo, we're preventing that\npassword guessing, okay?\n\n403\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.000\nDo be careful with that number.\n\n404\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.100\nI know people are gonna be tempted to say,\ntwo.\n\n405\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.340\nFive is a little bit on\nthe low side of things.\n\n406\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.620\nI might actually set this\nup somewhere closer to ten.\n\n407\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.460\nI know our military bases here in the US,\n\n408\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.860\na lot of them use a much lower\nnumber way down towards the bottom.\n\n409\n00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.750\nBut that's a very secure facility, right?\n\n410\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.090\nSo, they've got a little more,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n411\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.440\nThey need to be a little more secure\nthan most of our corporate environments.\n\n412\n00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.214\nCuz, honestly, what are the odds of me\nguessing Wes' password in the first\n\n413\n00:21:10.214 --> 00:21:12.389\nfive tries or the first ten tries?\n\n414\n00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:14.640\nHeck, I probably wouldn't get\nit in the first 20 tries.\n\n415\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.620\nBut if you set that number too low,\nif you think, okay,\n\n416\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.730\nI'm gonna make my system super secure.\n\n417\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.890\nI'm gonna say two bad guesses and\nyou're out.\n\n418\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.040\nThe account is gonna be locked.\n\n419\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.122\nWell, here's the problem with that.\n\n420\n00:21:27.122 --> 00:21:30.866\nYour helpdesk is gonna spend\nall day unlocking accounts.\n\n421\n00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:33.780\nBecause your end users, the ones that\nare actually supposed to be there,\n\n422\n00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.190\nare gonna end up locking\ntheir own accounts out.\n\n423\n00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.279\nAnd that's not what you're trying to do.\n\n424\n00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.789\nYou're trying to prevent the bad\nguys from guessing passwords, but\n\n425\n00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:43.540\nyou want your actual users to log on and\nwork.\n\n426\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.240\nAnd how easy is it to\nmistype your password?\n\n427\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.620\nLet's say, Friday afternoon, I get a pop\nup on the corner of my window down here\n\n428\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.090\nthat says, hey, Mike,\nit's time to change your password.\n\n429\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.558\nSo, I say, all right,\nI'll change my password.\n\n430\n00:21:54.558 --> 00:21:55.540\nIt's now changed.\n\n431\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.650\nI go home for the weekend.\n\n432\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.796\nI come back on Monday.\n\n433\n00:21:57.796 --> 00:22:00.030\nIt's Monday morning,\nit's 8 o'clock in the morning.\n\n434\n00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.796\nI'm wiping the sleep out of my eyes,\nI go to log on, and it says failed.\n\n435\n00:22:03.796 --> 00:22:06.350\nI'm like, that's right,\nthat's my old password.\n\n436\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.188\nI changed my password on Friday.\n\n437\n00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:10.190\nWhat the heck did I change it to?\n\n438\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.510\nI think it was this.\n\n439\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.180\nNope, all right,\nthat's already strike two.\n\n440\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.450\nAnd if you set that [LAUGH]\nnumber down to two,\n\n441\n00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.390\nI would have already\nlocked my account out.\n\n442\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.380\nNow, I've gotta call the helpdesk to\nget my account unlocked, yada, yada.\n\n443\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.110\nSo, again, don't set it too low because\nyou're just gonna make more work\n\n444\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.070\nrather than increase\nsecurity on your network.\n\n445\n00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.110\nSet it somewhere reasonable.\n\n446\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.010\nBut that's not for me to decide.\n\n447\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.520\nThat's for your organization to decide.\n\n448\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.050\nYou might say that three\nis a reasonable number.\n\n449\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:34.847\nOr you might say, you know what?\n\n450\n00:22:34.847 --> 00:22:38.421\nTen is more reasonable for\nour organization.\n\n451\n00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:39.543\nSo, something to ponder.\n\n452\n00:22:39.543 --> 00:22:44.380\nAll right, let's see, the other two\nthat I said now come into play.\n\n453\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.820\nOnce we enable Account lockout\nis the lockout duration and\n\n454\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.870\nthe Reset account lockout counter after.\n\n455\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.880\nThe lockout duration is how\nlong the account stays locked.\n\n456\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.170\n30 minutes is the default.\n\n457\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.557\nSo, if I accidentally ;logged,\nlet's say, I did set it to 3,\n\n458\n00:22:58.557 --> 00:23:00.598\nand I accidentally locked my account.\n\n459\n00:23:00.598 --> 00:23:03.220\nI could just sit here for\n30 minutes and wait.\n\n460\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.716\nAnd then, eventually, it'll unlock.\n\n461\n00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:09.500\nAt 30-minute, mark it'll unlock and\nI can guess again until I lock it again.\n\n462\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.433\nAnyway, I think, well, that's crazy.\n\n463\n00:23:10.433 --> 00:23:12.050\nThe bad guy's just gonna wait.\n\n464\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.540\nWell, hopefully, you know somebody notices\nthe bad guy sitting there, waiting for\n\n465\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.100\nthis thing [LAUGH] to time out, all right?\n\n466\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.680\nThey don't have all day to sit around and\ntry to guess passwords.\n\n467\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.920\nBut maybe, you want to bump that up.\n\n468\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.510\nMaybe, you want it to be an hour or\ntwo hours before it unlocks.\n\n469\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.610\nYou can also set it to\nremain locked indefinitely.\n\n470\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.400\nYou make to where they have\nto talk to an administrator.\n\n471\n00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.840\nThey have to go in Active Directory and\n\n472\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.140\nactually uncheck a check mark to\nunlock the account, all right?\n\n473\n00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.870\nA lot of companies do that, especially\nwith their more sensitive accounts.\n\n474\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:47.490\nBecause if somebody's doing password\nguessing on my domain admin account,\n\n475\n00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.310\nI need to know about it, all right?\n\n476\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.048\nI don't wanna just automatically\nresetting and they try again.\n\n477\n00:23:52.048 --> 00:23:54.308\nMaybe, they tried three tonight,\nthey locked it out.\n\n478\n00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:56.358\nThey try three again tomorrow night,\nthey locked it out.\n\n479\n00:23:56.358 --> 00:24:00.680\nAnd they're sitting there, trying to guess\nthis password And I'm none the wiser.\n\n480\n00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.380\nWhereas if it remains locked out forever,\nI have to go in and unlock it, now I know.\n\n481\n00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.150\nNow my sales manager has to come to me,\nfor example, and say,\n\n482\n00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.170\nhey my account got locked out.\n\n483\n00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.570\nI can ask him questions.\n\n484\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.940\nDid you mistype your password three times?\n\n485\n00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.120\nNo, it was locked when I came in.\n\n486\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.700\nThat means somebody is password guessing.\n\n487\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.240\nIf it wasn't you,\nsomebody was trying to log in as you and\n\n488\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.850\nnow I can up my auditing or\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n489\n00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.180\nSo you might set it to where it\nremains locked out indefinitely,\n\n490\n00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.000\nuntil somebody manually unlocks it.\n\n491\n00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.170\nThe other one is the reset\naccount lockout counter after.\n\n492\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.640\nBy default 30 minutes.\n\n493\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.720\nThis is how long it remembers\nyour failed attempts.\n\n494\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.300\nIn other words,\nit's 30 minutes by default.\n\n495\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.140\nSo if I come in at eight\no'clock in the morning and\n\n496\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.880\nI mistype my password, that's strike one.\n\n497\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.685\nAnd then I go that's right I changed\nit and I typed it in right and\n\n498\n00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:46.401\nI'm good to go.\n\n499\n00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:50.539\nAnd then I go to lunch, I come back,\nI mistype my password again,\n\n500\n00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:52.560\nis that strike two?\n\n501\n00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.540\nFailed attempt number two?\n\n502\n00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.785\nOr is that strike one?\n\n503\n00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:59.130\nWell, by default, it only remembers\nmy bad strikes for 30 minutes.\n\n504\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.090\nSo the one at lunchtime,\nit would have already forgot\n\n505\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.590\nabout my failed attempt at\n8 o'clock in the morning.\n\n506\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.610\nSo the one at lunch would be strike one.\n\n507\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.545\nIf I set that to eight hours,\nlike a typical workday,\n\n508\n00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:13.200\nhe one after lunch would be strike two and\n\n509\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.210\nnot strike one cuz it would still\nremember the one from this morning.\n\n510\n00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.780\nSo in a combination of these settings,\n\n511\n00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:24.210\nwe can do a great deal of improving\nthe security in our network and\n\n512\n00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.540\npreventing password guessing by turning\non the account lock out threshold and\n\n513\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.340\nthen determining how long they\naccount stays locked out and\n\n514\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.460\nhow long it remembers\nthose invalid attempts.\n\n515\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.250\nAlright cuz I know I\"m babbled on and on.\n\n516\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.200\nThere is one more thing\nI wanted to talk about.\n\n517\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.940\nI don't know if you guys can tell,\nI do like security,\n\n518\n00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.650\nespecially in the Windows environment.\n\n519\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.036\nI want to talk about App Locker and\n\n520\n00:25:48.036 --> 00:25:53.160\nsoftware restriction polices cuz these\nare other ways that we can control and\n\n521\n00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.186\nsecure our environments through policy.\n\n522\n00:25:57.186 --> 00:25:59.949\nAnd I'll just describe\nthem because on this exam,\n\n523\n00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:03.937\nthey're not gonna have you actually\nconfiguring an App Locker policy but\n\n524\n00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:07.921\nif they ask me what's a good way to\nprevent a sorted application from being\n\n525\n00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:12.189\nrun in my environment, I need to know\nwhat tools are available, within a GPO.\n\n526\n00:26:12.189 --> 00:26:15.200\nAnd I'll show you,\nwe'll just will configure one here.\n\n527\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.275\nI'll use the same GPO.\n\n528\n00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:19.806\nSo you guys wanna go\nback over to my screen.\n\n529\n00:26:19.806 --> 00:26:21.583\nLet's see we'll do Windows settings.\n\n530\n00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:26.510\nWe're gonna do security settings and\nthen down here I have software\n\n531\n00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.430\nrestriction policies and right before\nthat I have application control policies.\n\n532\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.980\nAlright?\n\n533\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.180\nBoth of these allow me to control\nwhich applications can and\n\n534\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.220\ncan not run on my systems on my network.\n\n535\n00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.470\nAlright?\nI might wanna\n\n536\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.970\nprevent people from being able to run\niTunes on my corporate machines, right?\n\n537\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.905\nOr playing World War Craft whatever\nthe common game is nowadays.\n\n538\n00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:51.510\nAnd this is what I can use to do this.\n\n539\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:57.670\nBasically with these policies, I need to\ndefine how to recognize the application.\n\n540\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.000\nLike if I go into app locker, or\napplication control policies and\n\n541\n00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.510\nthen app locker, there is executable\nrules, there's Windows installer rules,\n\n542\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.400\nthere's script rules, and\nthere's package app rules.\n\n543\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.440\nPackage app rules are for the new style\napps you get from the Windows store.\n\n544\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.310\nExecutables and\nif I wanted to block notepad.exe,\n\n545\n00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.530\nI just needed to know\nthe name of that executable.\n\n546\n00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.300\nWindows Installer rules,\nblocking MSI files from being run.\n\n547\n00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.680\nScript rules for blocking scripts.\n\n548\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.630\nPackage applicants for Windows store apps.\n\n549\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.558\nAnd we'll just go in there and\nwe'll define a new policy.\n\n550\n00:27:31.558 --> 00:27:36.262\nSo what I want you guys to understand\nis when I would use which one.\n\n551\n00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:38.080\nOkay, cuz they both\nreally do the same thing.\n\n552\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.934\nSoftware restriction policies are what\nwe had in the XP and prior days,\n\n553\n00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:46.189\napplication control policies and app\nlocker is what we got to invest in later.\n\n554\n00:27:46.189 --> 00:27:50.358\nIts the modern version of\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n555\n00:27:50.358 --> 00:27:52.720\nAlright, but they both do the same thing.\n\n556\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.530\nAnd we still have software restriction\npolicies because some of you might still\n\n557\n00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.050\nhave XP machines on your network, why not?\n\n558\n00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.720\nAnd application control policies\nwould not apply to Windows XP.\n\n559\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.750\nSo that's why we still have software\nrestriction policies, as well.\n\n560\n00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.790\nBut both of them allow me\nto flag an application\n\n561\n00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.510\nas not allowed to run on my machine.\n\n562\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.440\nSo just again,\n\n563\n00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.328\nthere might be an application that\nyou know has malware embedded in it.\n\n564\n00:28:19.328 --> 00:28:23.740\nAnd you wanna prevent anybody from trying\nto download and install that application.\n\n565\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.810\nThere's this Windows Store\napp that's the latest craze.\n\n566\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:31.990\nIt's Galaga Wars and everybody in the\ncorporate office, has this thing installed\n\n567\n00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.460\nand they're wasting, they're spending time\nthat should be working, playing this game.\n\n568\n00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.050\nWell I'm gonna prevent that game\nfrom installing on my machines.\n\n569\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.470\nI can make an app locker\npolicy to do that.\n\n570\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.005\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n571\n00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:43.515\nThat's a good way to control it and\nstay away from my computer.\n\n572\n00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:45.177\nComputer by the way.\n\n573\n00:28:45.177 --> 00:28:46.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Mike now it does\n\n574\n00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:48.855\nlook like we're coming to the end of\nanother episode, but before we do,\n\n575\n00:28:48.855 --> 00:28:51.955\ndo you have any additional words of wisdom\nyou'd like to impart before we sign off?\n\n576\n00:28:51.955 --> 00:28:55.985\n&gt;&gt; The biggest thing here I want you to\nunderstand is the different options that\n\n577\n00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:58.705\nwe have to control the environment.\n\n578\n00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:01.015\nSo using the local security policy or\n\n579\n00:29:01.015 --> 00:29:05.665\nthe local group policy versus security\ntemplates, versus group policy.\n\n580\n00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:10.360\nUnderstanding when the best time to\nuse each of those is going to be, and\n\n581\n00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.090\nthen being familiar with a couple\nof those settings within there.\n\n582\n00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.300\nYour password policies and your account\nlock out policies is always a good thing.\n\n583\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.610\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a lot of great information,\nMike, as always.\n\n584\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.050\nWe do appreciate you being here\nin the studios with us, and\n\n585\n00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.100\nwe also appreciate

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.230\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at Windows Network Security.\n\n8\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.920\nAnd with us today we have,\nMr Rodrick in the studios.\n\n9\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.280\nThank you for joining us, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.530\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for\nhaving me back, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.205\nExcited, as always,\nto be here doing our GIAC GSEC content.\n\n12\n00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so, what are we\ngoing to be starting with, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.380\n&gt;&gt; Today, we're gonna look at,\nwell, news network security and\n\n14\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.790\nwe're gonna focus in on\na couple of technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.290\nWe wanna look at the Windows Firewall.\n\n16\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.540\nWe also wanna take a look at IPsec.\n\n17\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.353\nUsing IPsec within Windows\nas well as some VPN.\n\n18\n00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:52.080\nWe'll take a look at VPN, what it is, and\nwe'll talk a little bit about it as well.\n\n19\n00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.918\nAnd then we'll round things out probably\nin another episode the way I like to talk\n\n20\n00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:57.109\nand stretch things out.\n\n21\n00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.549\nWe'll take a look at some Windows services\nand some best practices associated\n\n22\n00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.250\nwith those built-in service\naccounts that we have in Windows.\n\n23\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.980\nSo, those are the different things\nthat we have on tap for today.\n\n24\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.587\nSound exciting?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n25\n00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:09.116\nIt does, yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nshould we get started, then?\n\n27\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's do it.\n\n28\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n29\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.650\nwe're gonna start off talking about\nthe good old Windows Firewall.\n\n30\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.930\nAnd, on our exam objectives, they call out\nin this topic Windows network security,\n\n31\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.830\nthey call out the firewalls and\npacket filtering.\n\n32\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.470\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna take\na look at the Windows Firewall and\n\n33\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.140\nsee how we can do packet\nfiltering with that.\n\n34\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.210\nCuz a lot of people might not realize\nthat it does packet filtering.\n\n35\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.690\nMore likely, they just don't\nput the two pieces together and\n\n36\n00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.000\nunderstand that what they're doing\nis actually packet filtering.\n\n37\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.480\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, we did have an episode where\nwe discussed different types of firewalls,\n\n38\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.110\nso if we had to classify your\nintegrated Windows Firewall,\n\n39\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.430\nthat would be our host firewall, right?\n\n40\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there's gonna be a host\nspace firewall, which means,\n\n41\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.960\nit only protects that particular host,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.220\nIt's not worried about\nanything else on the network.\n\n43\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.731\nIt's like that fence, or wall, that you're\ngonna put up between your computer and\n\n44\n00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.349\nthe network that your\ncomputer is connected to.\n\n45\n00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.863\nAnd we should also understand that when we\nlook at networking, and IPv4, and TCP/IP,\n\n46\n00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:17.259\nwe're talking about just networking\nin general, there's, what, 65,530?\n\n47\n00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.930\n&gt;&gt; Five.\n\n48\n00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Five ports or six ports?\n\n49\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.022\nZero through?\n\n50\n00:02:20.022 --> 00:02:21.365\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:22.072\n&gt;&gt; 34, yeah, you get it.\n\n52\n00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.913\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The zero that is, no.\n\n53\n00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:24.905\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.240\n&gt;&gt; But there's a lot of ports.\n\n55\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.283\nAnd each one of those ports is\nbasically a doorway into your computer.\n\n56\n00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:34.423\nBecause remember when we create a socket,\na connection, between two machines,\n\n57\n00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:36.680\nwe've got three things that are needed.\n\n58\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.210\nWe've got the protocols\nbeing used like TCP.\n\n59\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.458\nWe have the IP address,\nthe destination of this connection,\n\n60\n00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:46.273\nwho I'm trying to connect to,\ntheir IPv4 address.\n\n61\n00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:48.555\nAnd then we have the port\nnumber which is the protocol.\n\n62\n00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:52.140\nAll right what port I'm connecting\nto on that other machine.\n\n63\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.876\nThose three things make up the socket.\n\n64\n00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:58.386\nSo, TCP 10.1.2.3:80 to connect to\n\n65\n00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:02.905\nthe web service on that\nparticular IP address.\n\n66\n00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:06.521\nAnd with all those ports,\neach one being a doorway in or basically\n\n67\n00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:11.210\na connection point that somebody can make,\nthat's a lot of ports to monitor.\n\n68\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.040\nSo a firewall allows me\nto shut them all down and\n\n69\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.620\nthen say, I wanna open up this one, and\nthis one, but not the rest of them, right?\n\n70\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.140\nSo I can pick and choose what kind of\ntraffic I wanna allow to come in and\n\n71\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.650\ncome out,\nwhich is packet filtering, right?\n\n72\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.060\nWhen we talk about a packet\nfiltering firewall,\n\n73\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.740\nwe're talking about one that looks at\nbasically the header information alone.\n\n74\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.210\nIt's looking at source and\ndestination IP address, source and\n\n75\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.470\ndestination port numbers and\nthe protocol that's being used.\n\n76\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.880\nSo when we go in and we work with the\nWindows Firewall, we can drop traffic or\n\n77\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.990\nblock or allow traffic, one of\nthe options is based on port number or\n\n78\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.700\nwhat protocol we wanna use.\n\n79\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.650\nThere are some others that\nwe can do in there as well.\n\n80\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.190\nSo it allows us to do that,\nto secure our computer.\n\n81\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.299\nI'm not running FTP.\n\n82\n00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.739\nI don't want anybody trying to connect\nto port 20 or 21 to my machine.\n\n83\n00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.350\nI'm not running a web service.\n\n84\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.930\nI don't want to allow port\n80 traffic into my machine.\n\n85\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.870\nI don't want my machine listening, or\n\n86\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.960\nI don't want this server on my\nnetwork listening on port 80.\n\n87\n00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.910\nThere's no reason for\nanybody to connect to that.\n\n88\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.211\nSo I can make rules that block those,\nall right?\n\n89\n00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.447\nNow on Windows Server by default,\n\n90\n00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:23.310\nthe firewall starts out pretty\nmuch blocking most things.\n\n91\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.040\nIt's gonna allow outbound traffic, but\n\n92\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.680\nit's gonna block most inbound traffic,\nwhich is the way we want it.\n\n93\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.890\n&gt;&gt; And that kind of falls back on the term\nimplicit deny, right, that we spoke about?\n\n94\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.720\nExactly, that way, it's basically saying\nunless you specifically allow it,\n\n95\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.030\nI'm going to try to block that traffic.\n\n96\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.050\nNow again, it's not locking everything.\n\n97\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.991\nYou definitely wanna go in and make sure\nit's configured the way you want it.\n\n98\n00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:48.370\nBut also remember what we talked about.\n\n99\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.810\nReturn traffic is not inbound traffic,\nright?\n\n100\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.970\nI know it's coming into your computer but\nit's not the same.\n\n101\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.710\nIt is return traffic.\n\n102\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.550\nYour computer requested that traffic.\n\n103\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.980\nIt went out, talked to somebody,\n\n104\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.480\nreturn traffic is part of\na conversation that you initiated.\n\n105\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.404\nSo it's going to be allowed\nby the firewall, right?\n\n106\n00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:09.187\nThis is why the bad guys want\nyou to click on things and\n\n107\n00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:12.667\nrun things from the inside because\nyou're opening up a doorway,\n\n108\n00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.698\nor allowing them in-\n&gt;&gt; Soliciting that communication instead\n\n109\n00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.122\nof an unsolicited communication.\n\n110\n00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:21.472\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and the firewall,\nwhen we add services to servers,\n\n111\n00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:24.030\nwe've gotta think about the firewall.\n\n112\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.270\nIf I wanna run a DHCP server service,\n\n113\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.150\nI install DHCP on that server but in order\nfor it to provide services to the network,\n\n114\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.300\nit needs to be listening\non port 67 by default.\n\n115\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.310\nSo, I've gotta make sure that port\ngets opened up, If I'm running DNS,\n\n116\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.210\nI've gotta have port 53 open.\n\n117\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.870\nIf I'm running Active Directory,\nIf I've got three to three 636 that's\n\n118\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.170\ngotta be listening there so, and a lot\nof these are configured automatically.\n\n119\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.960\nLike when you go and install DHCP or\nenable Remote Desktop, right?\n\n120\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.046\nIt's gonna say, hey, would you like me\nto make an exception for port 3389?\n\n121\n00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:04.067\nAnd you can say, yes, and it'll create\nthe rule for you, but not always.\n\n122\n00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:05.426\nYou gotta double check and\n\n123\n00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:08.759\nmake sure I've seen scenarios where\nit says it was gonna do it but\n\n124\n00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.150\nit never did it, and you're wondering\nwhy nobody can get DNS resolution.\n\n125\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.575\nAnd it's because, the firewall\ndidn't get configured properly.\n\n126\n00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.751\nSomething glitched, something happened,\n\n127\n00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:21.875\nthe account you were running didn't have\ncredentials to do the firewall exception,\n\n128\n00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.040\nand maybe it just didn't do it so\nyou always have to double check.\n\n129\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.172\n&gt;&gt; That's an amazing point to bring up,\nMike because, typically,\n\n130\n00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:34.746\nif you're not allowed to connect and\nyou have a misconfiguration like that and\n\n131\n00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:37.345\nit's an application or\nservice that your end users use,\n\n132\n00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:41.320\nthey'll notify you that a particular\nservice or piece of software is failing.\n\n133\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.270\nBut alternatively,\nif you have misconfigured and\n\n134\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.060\nhave open ports that shouldn't be open\nyou're not really gonna get notifications\n\n135\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.330\non that so you definitely wanna double\ncheck your configurations settings.\n\n136\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get other kinds of surprises.\n\n137\n00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:54.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Other than notifications, right?\n\n138\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.180\nAll your data starts drifting off\nthe network or you start blue screening or\n\n139\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.490\nyou get the old scary skull and\n\n140\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.610\ncrossbones laughing at you on your screen,\nthat's not good.\n\n141\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.418\nAll right, so let's take a look at a\nWindows Firewall, start off with a client.\n\n142\n00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:13.180\nIt's really the same that you're\ngonna see in a server as well.\n\n143\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.210\nWindows Firewall came out, what XP?\n\n144\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.940\nService Pack 3,\nI believe is when that came out.\n\n145\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.849\nIt's been a little while.\n\n146\n00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:22.600\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n147\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.376\nI think the Service Pack 2 is when a lot\nof the security features came out?\n\n148\n00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:27.473\nBut, I don't know if it was 2 or 3.\n\n149\n00:07:27.473 --> 00:07:28.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit might have been Service Pack 2.\n\n150\n00:07:28.606 --> 00:07:30.472\nSo, any of you people out\nthere in the chat room, yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft trivia.\n\n152\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.490\n&gt;&gt; It's a trivia question for you.\n\n153\n00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's the Service Pack 2 and\n\n154\n00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:36.630\nService Pack 3 that brought\nin the firewall there?\n\n155\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.149\n&gt;&gt; Nonetheless.\n\n156\n00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:37.738\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n157\n00:07:37.738 --> 00:07:40.499\nbut either way, Windows operating systems,\nboth client and\n\n158\n00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.631\nserver have a built in\nfirewall that we can use.\n\n159\n00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:43.818\nYou could do third party but\n\n160\n00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:46.690\nwe have to learn about Windows\nin this particular episode.\n\n161\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.415\nSo, let's take a look\nat my Windows Firewall.\n\n162\n00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:53.192\nI'm on my client and so,\nI'm gonna go to my Start menu and\n\n163\n00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:55.493\nI'm just gonna type in firewall.\n\n164\n00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:59.269\nAnd I'll see, I have a couple of options,\nactually I have Windows Firewall.\n\n165\n00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.983\nAnd then I have Windows Firewall\nthrough Advanced Security.\n\n166\n00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:05.640\nI have allow an app through a Firewall,\ncheck Firewall status.\n\n167\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.310\nSo we've got a few options here.\n\n168\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.355\nOn the client, I do wanna show you,\nif I go to Windows Firewall, it has a very\n\n169\n00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:17.565\nbasic panel where I can see currently\nI'm connected to the domain network or\n\n170\n00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:22.085\nthe domain profile is being applied\nto this particular connection.\n\n171\n00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.435\nBecause it detected the domain\ncontroller said I'm on the domain, so\n\n172\n00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:29.435\nI'm gonna allow certain things\nbecause I'm on a trusted network.\n\n173\n00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:34.359\nYou also have your private and\nyour guest profiles, or public profiles.\n\n174\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.920\nAnd great thing about the Windows Firewall\nis we do have these profiles.\n\n175\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.890\nMakes it a lot easier when\nyou move between trusted and\n\n176\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.030\nuntrusted networks especially on portable\ncomputers, laptops, things like that.\n\n177\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.710\nWe don't wanna have to reconfigure\nour Firewall every time but it,\n\n178\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.960\nit's a real pain.\n\n179\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.860\nIt's like, okay I need remote desktop\nenabled when I'm in the network\n\n180\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.110\nbecause that's what the help desk uses\nto connect to my machine to fix things.\n\n181\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.340\nBut when I go out to Starbucks I don't\nwant remote desktop listening for\n\n182\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.500\nany connections.\n\n183\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.970\nBut is an end user actually going to\nreconfigure their firewall every time they\n\n184\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.880\ngo from one place to the other?\n\n185\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.060\nMost likely not.\n\n186\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.980\nSo these profiles allow me to configure\nsettings on a per profile basis and\n\n187\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.060\nthen Windows will detect.\n\n188\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.910\nEvery time you connect to a new network\nWindows asks you, hey do you want to allow\n\n189\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.290\nother computers to see you and\nsee other computers on this network?\n\n190\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.700\nIf you say yes, you're saying it's\na private network, that you trust it and\n\n191\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.120\nevery time you connect to it from then on\nout it will apply that private profile.\n\n192\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.780\nIf you say no I don't wanna allow\nother computers to see me or\n\n193\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.680\nsee other computers, then it's gonna say\nthat's it's a public or guest network and\n\n194\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.870\nit's gonna apply the guest\nprofile which should be and\n\n195\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.440\nby default is much more stringent on what\nit's going to allow through that firewall.\n\n196\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.300\nSo we've got those profiles\nthat we can configure.\n\n197\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.690\nNow from this window I\nreally can't do a whole lot.\n\n198\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.500\nI can choose allow an app or\nfeature through the firewall.\n\n199\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.710\nSo if I have an application that I\nwanna allow to have Internet access,\n\n200\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.480\nI can come in here and\nyou can see this list.\n\n201\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.920\nI know you can't read it, but it's not\nimportant what I'm actually seeing here,\n\n202\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.760\nwhoops, didn't wanna change\nmy zoom level there.\n\n203\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.420\nI can choose, notice I got three check\nmarks, though, I do want you to see that.\n\n204\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.990\nBecause what if I wanna allow Pandora,\n\n205\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.830\nactually is enabled on all three of my\n[LAUGH] firewall rules there already.\n\n206\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.750\nI wanna allow that on my domain network,\nbut not my public network.\n\n207\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Mike's jamming out over here.\n\n208\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.250\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n209\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.120\nHey, you gotta have some good classical\nmusic when you're writing code or\n\n210\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.160\ndoing hacking,\nI mean it's just, I don't know.\n\n211\n00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.600\nIt makes my brain work better.\n\n212\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.620\nSo I can choose to allow them,\nI can't with this thing zoomed in.\n\n213\n00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.730\nBut if I zoom back out,\nmaybe I want to allow, just for an example\n\n214\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.510\nnet logon on the domain profile, but\nnot on the private and public, all right?\n\n215\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.840\nSo you can do that with this panel.\n\n216\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.960\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ncancel that out.\n\n217\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.500\nAnd I'm gonna go to the advanced\nsettings over here.\n\n218\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.180\nIt's saying, if I would have gone to the\nStart Menu and chosen Windows Firewall and\n\n219\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.340\nAdvanced Security,\nthis is where it's going to take me.\n\n220\n00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.700\nIt would be in the same place you can see\nWindows Firewall and Advanced Security.\n\n221\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.270\nAssume my three profiles I can\nsee that they're all turned on.\n\n222\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:15.719\nI can turn the firewall on or off, but\nthis Windows Firewall Advanced Security\n\n223\n00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:20.230\nis where I can work with\ninbound verses outbound rows.\n\n224\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:25.300\nI can be much specific here, I can control\nthe ingress and egress type rules.\n\n225\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.550\nSo I have my inbound rules.\n\n226\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.360\nI have green checkmarks for\nthe rules are enabled.\n\n227\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.080\nThe ones that don't have green\ncheck marks are not enabled there.\n\n228\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.870\nIf I zoom in,\n\n229\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.570\nI can see branch cash, cuz I don't\nbranch cash configured on this network.\n\n230\n00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.950\nSo those rules are not set up,\nthey're not allowed, all right?\n\n231\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:43.820\nPretty big list here.\n\n232\n00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.880\nI can go down and like ping,\necho request here's one.\n\n233\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.200\n[COUGH] I can see that all of my file and\n\n234\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.050\nprinter sharing echo requests ICMPv4 in\nand out, those are being blocked right.\n\n235\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.470\nOr it's not enabled anyway.\n\n236\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.500\nLet's see what else we wanna look at.\n\n237\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.340\nI'm pretty sure I made\nmy own rule up here and\n\n238\n00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.590\nI'll show you guys how to\ndo this in just a second.\n\n239\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.960\nAll of those are disabled.\n\n240\n00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.680\nThose are the built in rules.\n\n241\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.200\nYou can use those or\nyou can create your own rules and\n\n242\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.860\nyou can specify whatever you want.\n\n243\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Now when it comes to those built in or\nthose default rules and default profiles\n\n244\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.110\nand different Windows versions, they might\nbe called something slightly different.\n\n245\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.680\nLike here and the newer versions we see\ndomain whereas before I don't know if\n\n246\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.510\nit was, what was it called?\n\n247\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.710\nPrivate, I think, right?\n\n248\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.345\n&gt;&gt; Well, they called the domain private\nand then I think they called it home.\n\n249\n00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:33.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.215\n&gt;&gt; Private and home are the same thing.\n\n251\n00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you've got a home based operating\n\n252\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.460\nsystem that's not professional or\nenterprise and\n\n253\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.630\nprior to Windows 8, maybe,\nsomewhere around there.\n\n254\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.270\nWhen you first setup your machine,\nthey would say is your home network or\n\n255\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.700\na work network?\n\n256\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.090\nIt didn't matter what you picked because\nhome or work was gonna apply private.\n\n257\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.260\nI mean, you can't really choose domain.\n\n258\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.760\nIt automatically detects if\nthere's a domain controller.\n\n259\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.554\n&gt;&gt; It points to your domain.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n260\n00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:04.301\nif it detects that the domain controller\nis responding on the network,\n\n261\n00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.850\nit says I'm connected to the trusted\nnetwork and automatically applies that.\n\n262\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:13.310\nThere really is no difference between\nhome and work, or private and work.\n\n263\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.130\nThat's what they used to\ncall it was a work networks.\n\n264\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.750\nThen public is just public.\n\n265\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.210\n&gt;&gt; Obviously more restrictive than what we\nwould see on the private internal domain,\n\n266\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.100\nhome, or whatever you want to call it,\n\n267\n00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.250\nthe network the public is always\ngonna be more restrictive.\n\n268\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n269\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.250\nAll right, so if we wanna make let's\nsay we wanna do some packet filtering.\n\n270\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.080\nWe do not wanna allow any,\nI don't know let's pick a protocol.\n\n271\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.648\nWe'll start with our rule and\nsee what we wanna pick.\n\n272\n00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:42.955\nI'm gonna right-click on Inbound Rules and\nI'm gonna chose New Rule, all right?\n\n273\n00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.000\nAnd what we could do?\n\n274\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.660\nLet's do this,\nright now I've got my rules set,\n\n275\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.614\nI'm gonna turn this off,\nmy ICMPv4 rule here.\n\n276\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.080\nI'm gonna go in and, I cannot.\n\n277\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.410\nI'm pushing this out through group policy,\n\n278\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.120\ncuz I got tired of doing this\non every one of my lab machines.\n\n279\n00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.960\nIf you can't change\nthe properties of one of these,\n\n280\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.040\nit's most likely because it's being\npushed out through policy by your system\n\n281\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.700\nadministrators and\nyou're not allowed to change it.\n\n282\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.530\n&gt;&gt; And you shouldn't be, yeah.\n\n283\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.790\n&gt;&gt; So we'll make something else.\n\n284\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.208\nI'm going to right-click New Rule,\n\n285\n00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:13.990\ncuz really this is really\nwhat I want you to see.\n\n286\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.120\nWhen you come into the wizard,\n\n287\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.580\nyou've got a few options,\nprogram, port, predefined, custom.\n\n288\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.450\nProgram, it's kinda like clicking that\nallow an app through the firewall,\n\n289\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.880\nyou would just choose that,\nyou click next.\n\n290\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.810\nYou'd go find the executable that\nyou wanted to allow through, and\n\n291\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.910\nyou would keep on trucking.\n\n292\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.160\nAnd we'll see the rest of the wizard\nas I get to the other options.\n\n293\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.550\nSo you can do it on a per program basis.\n\n294\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.210\nYou can also do it on a per port basis.\n\n295\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.350\nSo if I choose port, and this is the one\nI wanna walk all the way through,\n\n296\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.480\nwe could pick a particular\nport number right?\n\n297\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.540\nAnd a protocol,\nthrough packet filtering there.\n\n298\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.270\nIf I choose predefined you'll see there\nare a lot of really nice predefined rules.\n\n299\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.690\nI can just come in here and\nsay you know what,\n\n300\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.680\nI need to allow secure\nsocket tunneling protocol.\n\n301\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.730\nNot exactly sure what port number that\nneeds, yada, yada, what protocols.\n\n302\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.360\nI can just choose this and\nclick Finish or Next, Finish and\n\n303\n00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.400\nI can be good to go, right?\n\n304\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.512\nSo those predefined rules, extremely\nhelpful especially when you're setting up\n\n305\n00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:17.300\nthings like branch cash, cuz they've got\nall these predefined rules, fantastic.\n\n306\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.570\nBut then you got port, which I said,\nand you've got custom.\n\n307\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.870\nCustom basically says I'm gonna give\nyou every page of this wizard and\n\n308\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.330\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n309\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.680\nEvery page that you would see\nwhether you picked program,\n\n310\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.810\nport, or predefined you're gonna see\nas you click Next, and it's up to you.\n\n311\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.210\nYou're telling the system that hey,\ndon't guide me,\n\n312\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.380\nI wanna see it all, I wanna pick and\nchoose what I want to do.\n\n313\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.240\nNow let's talk about the difference\nbetween doing say a port rule and\n\n314\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.170\na program rule.\n\n315\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.320\nCuz there is a subtle but very\nimportant difference between those two.\n\n316\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.650\nLet's say I have a program that uses for\ngiggles we'll just say port 45,000, right?\n\n317\n00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.710\nJust for a randomness.\n\n318\n00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.244\n&gt;&gt; Which falls under the dynamic port.\n\n319\n00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:02.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah which isn't the best [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] port numbers.\n\n320\n00:16:02.164 --> 00:16:03.502\n&gt;&gt; Let's say it uses port 8080.\n\n321\n00:16:03.502 --> 00:16:05.367\nHow about that, is that better?\n\n322\n00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:07.516\nLet's say I've got a program\nthat uses port 8080.\n\n323\n00:16:07.516 --> 00:16:09.620\nAnd I need to make an exception for it.\n\n324\n00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.250\nWell, I could come in here and\nI could choose program.\n\n325\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.490\nFind my executable.\n\n326\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.820\nGive it access through the firewall.\n\n327\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.912\nOr I could choose port number 8080.\n\n328\n00:16:17.912 --> 00:16:21.200\nEither one should accomplish\nthe same results.\n\n329\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.020\nBut there is a subtle difference there.\n\n330\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.640\nIf you do port number 8080,\n\n331\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.110\nanything that wants to use that port, that\nmeans that port is open no matter what.\n\n332\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.220\nYour computer is saying,\nyou told me to open up port 8080,\n\n333\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.260\nI don't care who tries to connect to it,\nit's open, and will allow that connection.\n\n334\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.515\nIf I do program,\n\n335\n00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:45.098\nonly if that program uses port 8080\nis it going to be allowed through.\n\n336\n00:16:45.098 --> 00:16:48.918\nIt also helps with programs that generate\na lot or that use a lot of dynamic ports.\n\n337\n00:16:48.918 --> 00:16:50.210\n&gt;&gt; Multiple ports, yeah.\n\n338\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.743\n&gt;&gt; Like a lot of things I know\nthis is an old example, but\n\n339\n00:16:52.743 --> 00:16:55.869\nit was one that's always stuck\nwith me it was World of Warcraft.\n\n340\n00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:59.462\nWhen you were doing your updates they had\na port number you would give it to allow\n\n341\n00:16:59.462 --> 00:17:00.660\nit to do these update, but\n\n342\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.710\nyou could assign multiple ports to\ngive a more bandwidth to allow,\n\n343\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.453\nto make more connections,\nto speed up the update process.\n\n344\n00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:08.455\nAnd that be an example\nwhere it'd be a lot easier,\n\n345\n00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:11.050\ninstead of specifying all\nof these individual ports.\n\n346\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.930\nI just said a while executable is allowed.\n\n347\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.130\nAnd now, it wouldn't matter what\nport that program tried to pull up\n\n348\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.690\nit would allow it to go through.\n\n349\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.520\n&gt;&gt; And then, as soon as you ended that\napplication then those ports that were\n\n350\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.910\nopen would go ahead and be shut down.\n\n351\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd\n\n352\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.290\nnobody else could try to use those ports,\nscan your machine, see those ports open\n\n353\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:33.100\nunless the application was actively\ncommunicating .at that point.\n\n354\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.320\nSo let's walk through\ndoing a port based one.\n\n355\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.290\nI'm gonna choose port.\n\n356\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.540\nI'll click Next.\n\n357\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.870\nAnd then, I choose my protocol.\n\n358\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.970\nIs it either going to be TCP UDP.\n\n359\n00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.030\nAll local ports or a specific port.\n\n360\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.315\nAnd Cherokee, I'll let you pick\nthe port number this time.\n\n361\n00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.281\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with 3389.\n\n362\n00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:48.081\nA little remote.\n\n363\n00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:49.043\n&gt;&gt; 3389.\n\n364\n00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:53.080\nLittle remote desktop port by default and\nwe'll click Next.\n\n365\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.070\nAnd then,\ndo I want to allow the connection,\n\n366\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.880\nallow the connection if its secure,\nor block the connection?\n\n367\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.090\n&gt;&gt; Only if it's secure, of course.\n\n368\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Only if it's secure.\n\n369\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.930\nWell, we don't have IP 6 set up so\nwe're not gonna choose that one just yet.\n\n370\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.800\nLet's block it.\n\n371\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.620\nLet's do that.\n\n372\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.880\nSo we'll choose.\n\n373\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.750\nBlock the connection.\n\n374\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.820\nI don't wanna allow Port 3389\nconnections on this machine.\n\n375\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.990\nSo I choose Block, I click Next.\n\n376\n00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.300\nAnd then,\nwhich profile do I wanna apply this to?\n\n377\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.420\nWell, maybe not my domain?\n\n378\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.740\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.797\n&gt;&gt; Because my help desk uses remote\ndesktop to fix my computer when I have\n\n380\n00:18:26.797 --> 00:18:27.334\na problem.\n\n381\n00:18:27.334 --> 00:18:28.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n382\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.720\n&gt;&gt; So I'll allow it on domain.\n\n383\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.688\nBut I'm gonna block it on private and\npublic networks.\n\n384\n00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:32.043\n&gt;&gt; Not while I'm out and about.\n\n385\n00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:37.219\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll click Next, I'll give\n\n386\n00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:42.405\nit a name, I'll say block 3389.\n\n387\n00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:49.170\nI'm gonna say private I guess I could\nput this in the description there.\n\n388\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.838\nWe'll just leave it at block 33.\n\n389\n00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:57.710\nAnd then I'll say,\nonly on Private and Public.\n\n390\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.540\nNow, I'll click Finish and now I'm gonna,\nand this says this every time.\n\n391\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.458\nI don't know what it is about it.\n\n392\n00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:06.821\nIt's a little glitch with Windows,\nwhen you finish making the rule,\n\n393\n00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:09.980\nthe firewall window actually\ngoes to the background.\n\n394\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.520\nSo this is the other window I had\nopen earlier, that I didn't need.\n\n395\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.910\nSo just be aware of that\nlittle glitch there.\n\n396\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.210\nAnd there you can see,\nblock 38th of 3389 is in place.\n\n397\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.850\nSo we're not locking that port.\n\n398\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, does the order, the actual\norder of this list here signify anything?\n\n399\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.408\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n400\n00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:35.300\nI typically sort it alphabetically\ncuz you can resort this.\n\n401\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.120\nIt does try to show you your customer\nrules, rules you've built up at the top.\n\n402\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.060\nAs you know those are not sorted, but\n\n403\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.540\nat some point I will sort this again\nbecause I can't find what I'm looking for.\n\n404\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.690\nRight now my customers rules are not\ngonna be at the top any more.\n\n405\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.763\nUnless you use the name and the convection\nlike an underscore something like that on\n\n406\n00:19:52.763 --> 00:19:55.163\nthe front to get,\nput it up to the top of the list.\n\n407\n00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:57.824\nI'm going to actually delete that rule,\n\n408\n00:19:57.824 --> 00:20:01.180\nI just don't want it to mess\nup any of our other labs.\n\n409\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.976\nSo lets delete that rule\nwe'll get rid of it.\n\n410\n00:20:03.976 --> 00:20:07.234\nThe only other thing I wanted\nto show you with the firewall,\n\n411\n00:20:07.234 --> 00:20:10.050\nwas how I can do this\nthrough group policy.\n\n412\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.430\nI think as admins that's something we're\ngonna need to know it's part of security\n\n413\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.030\nessentials.\n\n414\n00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.329\nIf I go to the group management\nconsole on my domain controller.\n\n415\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.440\nAnd I take my policy.\n\n416\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.213\nI'm just gonna use this lab policy.\n\n417\n00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:27.050\nAnd I'm gonna edit that policy.\n\n418\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.670\nAnd no worry this is not\na group policy class.\n\n419\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.550\nSo if you're not sure\nexactly what I'm doing.\n\n420\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.480\nGo check out our episodes on group policy.\n\n421\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.380\nI'm gonna expand that policies,\nWindows settings, security settings.\n\n422\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.410\nAnd down in here, I'm gonna see\nWindows Firewall Advanced Security.\n\n423\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.082\nAnd then, I'll see it again,\nwhich always makes me laugh.\n\n424\n00:20:44.082 --> 00:20:47.350\nAnd then, I'll expand that one out and\nI'll see inbound rules.\n\n425\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.830\nAnd there you can see\nthe rule that I created\n\n426\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.160\nthat was applying to all of\nthe machines and my network.\n\n427\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.750\nIf I right click new rules,\nyou'll see that it's the exact\n\n428\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.120\nsame wizard I just showed you\non that Windows Seven client.\n\n429\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.540\nThe difference is, I'm not configuring\nthe rule on any one machine,\n\n430\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.820\nI'm making a group policy\nthat includes the rule.\n\n431\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.590\nAnd now when machines on my network\nupdate their policy, they will import\n\n432\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:17.260\nthis rule into their own firewall and I\ncan apply it to whichever machines I want\n\n433\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.200\non the network without having to\nrun around to every single machine.\n\n434\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.786\nIf I've got 15 web servers,\n\n435\n00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:24.904\nI don't want to make a rule on\neach one of them individually.\n\n436\n00:21:24.904 --> 00:21:26.258\nI wanna set up a policy to do it so\n\n437\n00:21:26.258 --> 00:21:29.919\nthat it's consistently applied across\nall those web servers, I don't miss one.\n\n438\n00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:32.088\n&gt;&gt; Working smarter, not harder, right?\n\n439\n00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:35.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz what the problem is\nis I always fall over there.\n\n440\n00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.482\nI lean back and whoa,\na little gravity kicked in.\n\n441\n00:21:38.482 --> 00:21:40.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz we don't normally have\n\n442\n00:21:40.742 --> 00:21:42.075\ngravity at our studio.\n\n443\n00:21:42.075 --> 00:21:44.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Friday,\n\n444\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.700\nthis is when we recorded this episode so\nif you're watching this on another day,\n\n445\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.100\npause, wait until Friday and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.000\n&gt;&gt; It will all make sense.\n\n447\n00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.555\nSo where was I even going with that?\n\n448\n00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:55.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The problem with creating rules\n\n449\n00:21:55.294 --> 00:21:58.968\nindividually on individual machines\nis you don't get consistency,\n\n450\n00:21:58.968 --> 00:22:02.841\nyou might miss a machine, forget to\ndo one of them, something like that-\n\n451\n00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:04.650\n&gt;&gt; A lot of administrative effort.\n\n452\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.241\n&gt;&gt; And you wear out the sneaker net.\n\n453\n00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:07.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have to run around from machine to\n\n454\n00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.311\nmachine to machine and all of them-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n455\n00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:10.940\nif you wear squeaky shoes like me\nthat could be really annoying.\n\n456\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.530\n&gt;&gt; We could hear her coming a mile away.\n\n457\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.920\nSqueak, squeak, squeak.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.676\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n459\n00:22:14.676 --> 00:22:18.011\nso there's a good old look\nat the Windows Firewall.\n\n460\n00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:23.674\nI guess the only other thing I could\nis maybe show you it in action.\n\n461\n00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:26.797\nHow could I do that?\n\n462\n00:22:26.797 --> 00:22:32.786\nLet me just disable this policy for\na second.\n\n463\n00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:36.900\n&gt;&gt; Try to ping and then block that.\n\n464\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think what I'll do\nis I've disabled that policy.\n\n465\n00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.860\nWe'll flip back over to the client here.\n\n466\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.377\nAnd this is my client,\nI'm gonna update group policy.\n\n467\n00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:57.730\nWell, let policy update and see if my\nfirewall rule goes away, which it should.\n\n468\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.860\nAnd then, pings won't be allowed,\nand we'll see what happens.\n\n469\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.540\nThen, we'll create the rule again,\nand we'll see that it's good to go.\n\n470\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.306\nSo now,\nthat it's updated the computer policy,\n\n471\n00:23:07.306 --> 00:23:10.362\nI'm going to refresh my inbound rules.\n\n472\n00:23:10.362 --> 00:23:13.196\nAnd if I look, what did I call that thing?\n\n473\n00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:15.755\nSomething about allow ICMP4.\n\n474\n00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:19.130\nAnd it does like look it is gone.\n\n475\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.860\nSo let's try it.\n\n476\n00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.715\nIf I flip back to the domain controller,\nopen up command prompt, ping,\n\n477\n00:23:25.715 --> 00:23:30.720\nclient one, you can see it resolves\n\n478\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:36.290\nthe IP address, but\nit's not successfully pinging that guy.\n\n479\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:43.248\nSo if I go back over to the client and\nwe make a new rule,\n\n480\n00:23:43.248 --> 00:23:48.984\nright click &gt; New Rule&gt; Port&gt; Nex&gt; TCP.\n\n481\n00:23:48.984 --> 00:23:50.025\nActually, I take that back.\n\n482\n00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:55.402\nWe'll do TCP.\n\n483\n00:23:55.402 --> 00:24:00.412\nTCP, all ports,\nwhich is not actually what I want.\n\n484\n00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:01.170\nSo let's do that again.\n\n485\n00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.527\nLet's do a custom rule.\n\n486\n00:24:04.527 --> 00:24:07.686\nAnd I'll click Next, and\nwe'll do All Programs.\n\n487\n00:24:07.686 --> 00:24:12.270\nBut then I wanna choose a particular,\nno I don't want a service, wow.\n\n488\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.410\nMike's having trouble\ncreating a new firewall rule.\n\n489\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.360\nAll Programs, and then here I'm\ngonna choose my protocol ICMPv4.\n\n490\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.370\nAnd I'm not gonna customize it.\n\n491\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:25.980\nI could just use like echo requests and\nnot some of the other ICMP type messages.\n\n492\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna leave it like it is.\n\n493\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.370\nI'll click Next.\n\n494\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.300\nWe'll say, Any for Source Destination.\n\n495\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.790\nI'm gonna allow the connection.\n\n496\n00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.760\nNext.\n\n497\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.700\nI'll apply it to just my domain profile,\n\n498\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.090\ncuz we use ping's test network\nconnectivity in our domain.\n\n499\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:45.666\nNext, I'll give it a name, allow ICMPv4.\n\n500\n00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:49.410\nI'll click Next.\n\n501\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.260\nAnd again, in a sense I went into\nthe background like it was telling you.\n\n502\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.550\nBut now, there is my rule, it is enabled.\n\n503\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.520\nSo if I go back over to\nthe domain controller,\n\n504\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.140\nI try to ping that client again.\n\n505\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.050\nAll of a sudden,\nit is responding to those.\n\n506\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.380\nSo really what I did was\nthe opposite of filtering a packet.\n\n507\n00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.050\nWell, I still am doing packet filtering.\n\n508\n00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.990\nWhen we say packet filtering, it's not\nnecessarily dropping packets, right?\n\n509\n00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.540\nIt could be allowing\na certain type of packet, but\n\n510\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.100\nthe opposite would be true as well.\n\n511\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.510\nI could have gone in there and\nsaid, look, FTP.\n\n512\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.470\nDo not allow or block and\nwe could have blocked all FTP traffic.\n\n513\n00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.550\nSo good to see how we can use that Windows\nfirewall to help secure our environment.\n\n514\n00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.010\nWe've gotta make sure that\nthe firewall's enabled.\n\n515\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.030\nIt's one of those things that the users\nwill try to turn off because they think it\n\n516\n00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:38.850\nmakes the machine faster, but\nit is that layer of security that we need.\n\n517\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.650\nWe also need to understand in Windows\nenvironment or in domain environment\n\n518\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.440\nanyway that we can use group policy to\nmake the administration of the firewall\n\n519\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.070\nsetting a lot easier as well as\nprevent the users from being able to\n\n520\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.160\nchange settings that you've decided need\nto be applied to those client machines.\n\n521\n00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's one of\nthose things that are kind\n\n522\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.680\nof like any kind of anti malware programs.\n\n523\n00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.300\nYou don't wanna have\nmore than two running but\n\n524\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.410\nif you think about having a host based\nfirewall and then also having a network\n\n525\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.410\nbased firewall, it doesn't matter\nthat they're both running.\n\n526\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.930\nThey're not gonna conflict in any way.\n\n527\n00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.450\nSo really end users shouldn't really\nturn their firewall off maybe,\n\n528\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.760\nunless they were troubleshooting,\nto try to get an application to work or\n\n529\n00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.550\nsomething like that.\n\n530\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.960\nBut otherwise,\nI can't think of another reason.\n\n531\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.070\nInstalling, maybe some\nanti-malware software maybe.\n\n532\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n533\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.990\nThe funny thing is,\nif your user has administrative rights,\n\n534\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.900\nthey can change things.\n\n535\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.730\nAnd I can't tell you how many\nforum posts blogs that I've read,\n\n536\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.470\nyou're like, hey this isn't working.\n\n537\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.810\nI'm having trouble making\nthis connect to so-and-so.\n\n538\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.690\nAnd you're reading this blog,\nand somebody will say,\n\n539\n00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.238\nalways inevitably one of the posts is,\nturn off your firewall.\n\n540\n00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:46.990\nI am like duh, yeah, that's going to\nfix it, but that's not the solution.\n\n541\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.770\nRight?\nWe don't\n\n542\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.600\nturn it off to fix a small problem.\n\n543\n00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.215\nTo allow one program to talk,\nyou don't disable the entire firewall.\n\n544\n00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:55.350\nPlease don't do that [LAUGH].\n\n545\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike I know\nwe're getting close on time,\n\n546\n00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.680\ndo you wanna take a look at IP security or\ndo you wanna wait until the next episode?\n\n547\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.390\n&gt;&gt; You know what, rather than try to\nsqueeze it in in a couple minutes I got\n\n548\n00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.635\na lot more to say about it.\n\n549\n00:27:03.635 --> 00:27:05.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's save that for another episode.\n\n550\n00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, all right.\n\n551\n00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.010\nSo thank you so much for being here,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n552\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.240\njoining us as well.\n\n553\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.920\nBut stay tuned.\n\n554\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.063\nLike Mike said we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n555\n00:27:13.063 --> 00:27:14.679\nWe'll go ahead sign off for this show.\n\n556\n00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:15.813\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n557\n00:27:15.813 --> 00:27:16.919\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:11.844\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nGIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.896\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:21.319\nThis is actually a part two,\na continuation from a discussion we're\n\n7\n00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:25.390\npreviously having on our\nWindows Networking Security.\n\n8\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.306\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick in the studio.\n\n9\n00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:28.889\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.779\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back even though I talk so\n\n11\n00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.190\nmuch and make part twos and threes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.248\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.\n\n13\n00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:35.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n14\n00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.026\n&gt;&gt; We'll get there.\n\n15\n00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:38.955\n&gt;&gt; You're good, all right so yeah,\nwe do, we wanna continue on,\n\n16\n00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.670\nwe looked at firewalls in that previous\nepisode of part one, Windows Security.\n\n17\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.802\nNext one we wanna take a look\nat is something called IPsec.\n\n18\n00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.955\nAnd I know we've mentioned that\nin a couple of other episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:50.371\nLet's rehash what we already know and\n\n20\n00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:54.690\nthen we'll add a little bit to it as\nwell as do a quick demo on IPsec.\n\n21\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.753\nSo IPsec,\nInternet Protocol Security, right?\n\n22\n00:00:57.753 --> 00:01:02.335\nIs a protocol that we can use\nto either authenticate and,\n\n23\n00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:07.430\nor encrypt traffic going back and\nforth between two nodes.\n\n24\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.757\nAnd it allows me to do, remember IPsec\nworks down at layer, gosh two or three,\n\n25\n00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:18.438\nway down on the OSI model, which means\nit's application-independent, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:21.470\nWhereas something like SSL, your browser,\n\n27\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.010\nthe application itself\nhas to understand SSL.\n\n28\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.870\nIf it doesn't support it,\nyou're not gonna be able to do it,\n\n29\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.152\nbecause it's taking place up\nthere at the application layer.\n\n30\n00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.950\nWhereas IPsec is way\ndown on the OSI model,\n\n31\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.830\napplication doesn't have\nto know anything about it.\n\n32\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.970\nIt just sends its data as it\ngoes down through the layer,\n\n33\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.350\nit gets encrypted when it gets down to\nthe bottom, goes across the network.\n\n34\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.200\nIt's decrypted well before it gets back\nto the application on the other side, so\n\n35\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.760\nthe application is completely unaware\nof what's going on, which is great,\n\n36\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.720\nbecause I can secure any\nkind of traffic using IPsec,\n\n37\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.200\nit doesn't matter what the application is.\n\n38\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.290\nSo that's a cool thing.\n\n39\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.290\nWith IPsec we could spend a whole, gosh,\n\n40\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.250\nwe could do a whole series on IPSsec,\nbecause there are a lot of options to it.\n\n41\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.850\nYou create your rules, we decide how\nwe want to apply this to the traffic.\n\n42\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.190\nWhat rules we wanna put in\nplace to trigger IPsec.\n\n43\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.210\nAnd we'll take a look, I'll show you\nthe wizard, and we'll walk through it and\n\n44\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.580\nwe'll make a simple one there.\n\n45\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.690\nBut like I said,\nit's used any time I need to encrypt or\n\n46\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.570\nsecure, at least authenticate,\nusually encrypt.\n\n47\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.210\nCuz it does have two different modes,\nwhere we can do authentication header.\n\n48\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.820\nWhere we're only providing data integrity,\nmaking sure it hasn't been modified.\n\n49\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.180\nOr I can do ESP my\nEncapsulating Security Payload\n\n50\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.040\nwhere I do protect the payload itself,\n\n51\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.590\nwhere I encrypt the traffic as well as\ndo integrity checks on that, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.180\nWhat else do I wanna say about that?\n\n53\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.180\nI guess from a Window perspective with\nIPsec, we enable it using policies.\n\n54\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.030\nWe create IPsec policies that\ndefine what it is we need to do or\n\n55\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.360\nhow we want to apply IPsec.\n\n56\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.166\nLike we can say,\n\n57\n00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.863\nlet's say I've got a server that has\nsensitive information on it, right?\n\n58\n00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:08.852\nHealthcare information or\nsomething like that.\n\n59\n00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:13.490\nAnd I wanna make sure anytime somebody\nconnects to that traffic is encrypted.\n\n60\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.322\nSo, if anybody is sniffing the network,\nthey're not gonna be able to\n\n61\n00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.879\nsee that information that they\nmight not be authorized to see.\n\n62\n00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.666\nSo, we can set it up to where,\n\n63\n00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:25.252\nif you're connecting to this server,\nthe connection has to be encrypted.\n\n64\n00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:30.730\nAnd we do that again using\nthese Windows policies.\n\n65\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.510\nNow, let's take a look at what's\na good way to show you this.\n\n66\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.280\nLet me hold off before we go to that\nscreen, let me say a couple more things.\n\n67\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.390\nThere are some default policies\nwe can use within Windows.\n\n68\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.660\nThere's client respond only.\n\n69\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.590\nThere's secure server request server.\n\n70\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.600\nAnd then there's server require security.\n\n71\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.140\nAnd basically what those do,\nif you require security that means\n\n72\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.860\nevery connection to that machine is\ngonna have to be encrypted with IPsec.\n\n73\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.374\nIf you do the secure\nserver request security,\n\n74\n00:03:59.374 --> 00:04:03.756\nthat means when a server receives a\nconnection attempt it's gonna say hey, Mr.\n\n75\n00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:07.696\nConnector, whoever's trying to\nconnect to it, let's encrypt this.\n\n76\n00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:09.687\nIf the other end says\nI don't understand or\n\n77\n00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:12.390\nif it says I can encrypt\nthen we'll encrypt it.\n\n78\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.115\nIf the other end says I don't understand\nIPsec, I don't know how to do it,\n\n79\n00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:20.336\nthen the server's gonna say I'll let you\nconnect anyway at least we tried, get it?\n\n80\n00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:24.737\nRequest security, you're gonna try to\nencrypt it but if it doesn't, okay,\n\n81\n00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:25.350\nwe tried.\n\n82\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.470\nAnd then the client respond\nonly means the client,\n\n83\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.640\nthe node will never\ninitiate secure connection.\n\n84\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.480\nBut if the other end says hey let's\nencrypt it, the client can say okay,\n\n85\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.580\nI understand IPsec, let's do that.\n\n86\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.720\nBut it'll never initiate on its own.\n\n87\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.630\nDo understand those policies don't\nmean server requires security,\n\n88\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.130\nserver requests security,\ndon't have to be done on a server.\n\n89\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.078\nThey're most commonly implemented there,\nbut they don't have to be.\n\n90\n00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:56.430\nClient Respond Only doesn't have to\nbe done on a client operating system.\n\n91\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.837\nIt can be done on anything, it's jut\ntypically we do that on the client, right?\n\n92\n00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:02.911\nBecause normally our clients\nare clients are connecting to,\n\n93\n00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:04.640\nwhen I say client, I mean.\n\n94\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.636\n&gt;&gt; End users?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, client operating systems or\n\n95\n00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:07.410\nend users.\n\n96\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.270\nThey're connecting to both secure secure\nresources and unsecure resources.\n\n97\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.670\nIf I made my clients require security,\n\n98\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.340\neverytime they connected to anything,\nthey would say let's encrypt it.\n\n99\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.440\nIf they couldn't encrypt it,\nthey wouldn't be able to connect.\n\n100\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.270\nSo when they browsed the web, things like\nthat, it just wouldn't work anymore.\n\n101\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.780\nYou have to be real careful like\nwith authentication traffic and\n\n102\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.870\nthings like that.\n\n103\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.630\nYou can end up locking a lot of stuff, so\n\n104\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.000\nnormally the client is\nleft as respond only.\n\n105\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.830\nIf the server requires it,\ngreat, I can respond with it.\n\n106\n00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.890\nBut if the server doesn't request it,\nI'm not gonna request it either,\n\n107\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.480\nwe'll just kinda [SOUND] let\nthe connection happen anyway, right?\n\n108\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.778\nBut then of course,\nwe can make our own policies,\n\n109\n00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:49.698\nwhich is typically what we're\ngonna do on most of our devices.\n\n110\n00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:52.610\nAll right,\nnow to work with these IPsec policies,\n\n111\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.160\nwe can do it through group policy, which\nis typically where we're gonna do it.\n\n112\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.594\nBecause we don't wanna do this\nto a one machine at a time,\n\n113\n00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:01.186\nwe wanna do it to a bunch of machines.\n\n114\n00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.993\nBut I'm gonna use the console here,\n\n115\n00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:06.030\nI'll show you how we can do\nthat on an individual machine.\n\n116\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.120\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n117\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.506\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what I'm gonna do,\nto work with this,\n\n119\n00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:12.320\nyou're normally gonna make a console.\n\n120\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.980\nThere's a snap-in called\nthe IPsec Policy Manager.\n\n121\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.130\nThere's another snap-in\ncalled the IPsec Monitor.\n\n122\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.500\nAnd I typically make my own\nMicrosoft Management Console, MMC.\n\n123\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.010\nAnd I add those to it, and\nthen I can use it from then on out,\n\n124\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.460\nthat's what I have over here.\n\n125\n00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.033\nBut just in case you don't know how to\ndo that, let me show you, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:34.122\nI'm gonna go to my menu, and\nI'm gonna type in MMC, which stands for\n\n127\n00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:36.790\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n128\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.167\nAnd, just to show you how great\nWindows is at searching for things,\n\n129\n00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:41.539\nyou'll see what comes up.\n\n130\n00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:45.619\nGroup Policy Management,\n\n131\n00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.680\ndoesn't look anything like\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n132\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.366\nIf I put a dot, because it's really\nmmc.msc, all of a sudden it does show up.\n\n133\n00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:59.225\nBut if I put the rest of the name, MSC,\nit says I can't find anything like that.\n\n134\n00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:01.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is why Microsoft should not be in\n\n135\n00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.935\nthe search engine business, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:07.257\n[LAUGH] They should just leave it to\nthe professionals that know how to make\n\n137\n00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:08.079\na search engine.\n\n138\n00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:11.349\nI'm just kidding Microsoft, but\nit is odd, I know there are reasons for\n\n139\n00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.620\nit that we're not going to get into here,\nbut it's just humorous I think.\n\n140\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.526\nSo anyway, yes?\n\n141\n00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:19.758\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I see the icon here,\nit's a little toolbox, a kit, right?\n\n142\n00:07:19.758 --> 00:07:23.793\nSo if there were particular applications\nor tools that I used quite often,\n\n143\n00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:27.894\nI could go ahead and insert them into\ncreating my own personalized toolkit,\n\n144\n00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.570\nper se, that's what we're looking at here.\n\n145\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, in our Windows\nclasses we'll show you how to use these.\n\n146\n00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:38.026\nLike f I wanna delegate administration and\ngive somebody access to say DHCP,\n\n147\n00:07:38.026 --> 00:07:42.400\nI can make them custom consoles,\ngive them rights to just those things.\n\n148\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.923\nI love Microsoft Management Consoles,\nthey're fantastic.\n\n149\n00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:48.458\nSo we're gonna File &gt; Add,\nRemove Snap In, and\n\n150\n00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:53.387\nI'm gonna find the IP Security\nPolicy Management Snap In, right?\n\n151\n00:07:53.387 --> 00:07:54.920\nAnd I'm gonna click Add.\n\n152\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.727\nNow, when I do this, it's gonna wanna\nknow, what are you gonna manage?\n\n153\n00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.039\nPolicies on the local computer,\npolicies from the domain, or\n\n154\n00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:05.580\npolicies from some other domain that you\ndon't belong to or another computer.\n\n155\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.470\nWell, I'm gonna leave\nit on local computer,\n\n156\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.030\nI just want to show you\na quick example here.\n\n157\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.130\nI'm gonna click finish and I'm also\ngonna add the IP Security monitor.\n\n158\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.860\nCuz this is how I can monitor\nIP security connections, and\n\n159\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.980\nhow we can verify that something's\nworking or not working.\n\n160\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.460\nSo I'll add that one as well,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n161\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.590\nNow I'm gonna cancel it because\nI've already created this console,\n\n162\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.150\nyou see it on my desktop.\n\n163\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.700\nBecause I did this earlier,\nand I saved the console, so\n\n164\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.720\nI don't have to go through this every\ntime I want to work with IPSEC.\n\n165\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.790\nSo I'm gonna cancel it, close it,\nand open up my other console.\n\n166\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.680\nAnd here we go, so you can see I've\ngot those same two snap ins added.\n\n167\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.900\nThe IP security monitor, and the IP\nsecurity policies on local computer.\n\n168\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.870\nNow I've also already made a policy, but\n\n169\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.370\nlet me show you what that entails cuz\nthat's what we really want to see here.\n\n170\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.470\nI'm gonna choose create,\n\n171\n00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.790\nI right clicked, I'm gonna choose\ncreate IP security policy.\n\n172\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.840\nIt's gonna launch my wizard\nwhere I'll click next.\n\n173\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.018\nI'll give it a name and\nI'm just gonna call this, IPSEC Demo.\n\n174\n00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:14.002\nThen I'll click next.\n\n175\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.580\nAnd then this is for\nsome of the default rules,\n\n176\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.480\nthe default response rule only\nsupported 2003, XP, and prior.\n\n177\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480\nNone of my systems are running that so\n\n178\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.250\nI'm not going to bother\nactivating that default policy.\n\n179\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.580\nAnd then it says okay I made it.\n\n180\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.950\nWasn't a whole lot of information.\n\n181\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.400\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; It basically made the shell of a policy\n\n182\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.740\nand I need to go back in and\nmodify the settings in there.\n\n183\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.460\nAnd, you can see in the middle this\nhas edit properties already selected.\n\n184\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.550\nSo, when I click finish,\nit's going to say, okay,\n\n185\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.510\nnow you can really make your policy.\n\n186\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.060\nGo ahead, and do what you need to do.\n\n187\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.420\nThere's that default response rule,\nwhich I'm not going to enable.\n\n188\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.650\nSo, I'm going to click add.\n\n189\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.590\nAnd, this is my IP security rule, and\n\n190\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.725\nit's a wizard that walks\nme through the process.\n\n191\n00:09:57.725 --> 00:09:59.150\nI'll click next.\n\n192\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.940\nAnd then do I want to specify a tunnel or\nnot?\n\n193\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.220\nIP set can be used to create\na permanent tunnel between two nodes or\n\n194\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.660\neven between inter-connectivity devices.\n\n195\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.680\nLike between a branch office and\na corporate office.\n\n196\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.580\nIf you were using servers for\nyour routers and\n\n197\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.390\nthings like that you could\nset up something like that.\n\n198\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.790\nOr just any kind of permanent tunnel.\n\n199\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.370\nWe're not going to so\nI'm going to click next.\n\n200\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.190\nI'm going to apply this to\nall network connections.\n\n201\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.662\nBut maybe it would only apply to one of\nthe many network adapters that are located\n\n202\n00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:29.650\nin that server, for example.\n\n203\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.300\nOr only when remote access\nconnections are made\n\n204\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.970\ndo I want this particular\npolicy to kick in.\n\n205\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.540\nI'll leave it on All Network Connections,\nI'll click next.\n\n206\n00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.010\nAnd then your filter list.\n\n207\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.710\nThis is what it's going to\nuse to trigger the policy.\n\n208\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.355\nNow, I've already created one for\nmy other rule, ICMP.\n\n209\n00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:48.680\nBut if I didn't have one,\nI would click add.\n\n210\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.710\nThen I would give it a name.\n\n211\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.060\nI'll call this my Demo Rule.\n\n212\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.040\nThis is where it's gets really twisty,\nladies and\n\n213\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.520\ngentlemen, because you're making a policy.\n\n214\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.760\nThen within the policy, you've launched\nanother wizard to create a filter.\n\n215\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.930\nAnd it can really tease the brain\nif you're not careful with this.\n\n216\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.560\nSo I'm gonna click demorule.\n\n217\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.230\nAnd I'm going to click add and\nhere's another wizard that I've launched.\n\n218\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo I'm like in a wizard inside\na wizard inside a wizard.\n\n219\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.040\n&gt;&gt; The twilight zone.\n\n220\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, in front of you is a door.\n\n221\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.810\nSo we're gonna click next.\n\n222\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.530\nI can choose mirrored,\nwhich means hey I'll do the same\n\n223\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.914\nrule whether it's inbound or outbound,\ndepends on what you are trying to do.\n\n224\n00:11:24.914 --> 00:11:27.240\nI'll leave it mirrored, that's fine.\n\n225\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.180\nSource, I can go my IP address,\nany specific name or specific IP address.\n\n226\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.680\nWhat you are doing is you\nare trying to set it up.\n\n227\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.740\nWhat is gonna trigger the request for\nsecurity?\n\n228\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.070\nI don't wanna encrypt all traffic.\n\n229\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.440\nThere's too much overhead involved, there\nare too many things that don't support,\n\n230\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.330\nthe other end of the connection\nmight not support IPsec.\n\n231\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.270\nWe're gonna come back to that in a second.\n\n232\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.230\nSo you typically don't encrypt\njust everything blanketed,\n\n233\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.020\nit's just too much overhead on the network\nand your network adapters and your CPUs.\n\n234\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.500\nSo what's gonna trigger this rule is it,\nthis particular IP address,\n\n235\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.430\nobviously I'll just leave it as any,\nthe destination I'll leave as any as well.\n\n236\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.880\nAnd then, maybe the protocol.\n\n237\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.830\nI'm gonna say, well, let's choose,\nI don't know, I did ICMP already.\n\n238\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.640\nMaybe I'll do other.\n\n239\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.870\nAnd I'll say 21.\n\n240\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.410\nThere might be some FTP traffic.\n\n241\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.380\nAnd I can click Finish.\n\n242\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.690\nAnd now, I've got this demo rule created,\nand in there is my filter.\n\n243\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.140\nAnd so I'll click OK to close that, so\n\n244\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.090\nwe're kinda backing our\nway out of the wizards.\n\n245\n00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.190\nThen I would choose the filter.\n\n246\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.220\nEasy one to forget right here.\n\n247\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.860\nJust cuz you made the new filter,\nit doesn't automatically select it.\n\n248\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.030\nYou can only select one at a time-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.330\n&gt;&gt; And you select your filter-\n\n250\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.715\n&gt;&gt; Aw, man that would be such a bummer,\n\n251\n00:12:42.715 --> 00:12:43.623\nwhat a waste of my time.\n\n252\n00:12:43.623 --> 00:12:44.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not even working and\n\n253\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.940\nI just went through all that.\n\n254\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you come back to realize, I\nforgot to actually click the radio button.\n\n255\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.650\nYou would think maybe that as you made it,\nit would say,\n\n256\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.330\nokay you must wanna select it, but\nmaybe there's a reason you don't.\n\n257\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.960\nClick next, and then filter action,\nwait another wizard, yeah.\n\n258\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.410\nWhat's it gonna do if\na packet triggers this?\n\n259\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.620\nSo here's this packet coming in,\nhey it's port 21,\n\n260\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.820\nyou said IP sec was suppose\nto kick in on that.\n\n261\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.260\nBut you didn't say what IP\nsec was supposed to do.\n\n262\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.050\nSo you click Add and\nit launches another wizard.\n\n263\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.157\nOr you click next, you give it a name,\nand I'm gonna call this my demo filter.\n\n264\n00:13:19.157 --> 00:13:22.157\n&gt;&gt; You're getting really\ncreative with these names.\n\n265\n00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:23.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n266\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.620\nAnd then what do I want to do?\n\n267\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.120\nDo I want to permit, block,\nor negotiate security?\n\n268\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.350\nPermit would just allow it,\nwhether there was security or\n\n269\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.950\nnot it would just say okay,\nit's allowed to come in.\n\n270\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.300\nKind of like doing packet filtering.\n\n271\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.690\nYou can use IP SEC to do\nrudimentary packet filtering, or\n\n272\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.470\nblock, drop the packet,\nor negotiate security.\n\n273\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.250\nAnd that's typically\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\n274\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.710\nI want to, if this type of traffic comes\nin, from this particular address or\n\n275\n00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.420\nthis particular subnet,\nI want to protect it.\n\n276\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.620\nSo we're gonna negotiate security,\nwe're gonna kick in IPsec.\n\n277\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.140\nI'll click next, and\ndo not allow an insecure connection, or\n\n278\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.000\nallow it if the secure connection\ncannot be established.\n\n279\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.110\nAll right, what if the other end,\n\n280\n00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.180\nand I don't agree on how\nto protect this traffic?\n\n281\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.570\nDo I allow it anyway?\n\n282\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.310\nOr do I block it?\n\n283\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.910\nWell I'm gonna block it.\n\n284\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.630\nIf it's not secure, you can't talk to me.\n\n285\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.890\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n286\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.750\nDo I want to do just integrity,\nmaking sure it hasn't been modified?\n\n287\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.160\nOr do I want to encrypt it as well?\n\n288\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.400\nI'll do the integrity and encryption.\n\n289\n00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.440\nI'll click next and then finish.\n\n290\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.350\nYou do have to choose the filter to make\nsure you apply the filter, and then next.\n\n291\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.805\nThen, how do I want to authenticate it?\n\n292\n00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:39.450\nIn a domain environment, easiest way\nis Kerberos because every computer and\n\n293\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.350\nevery user has an account and\nthat can be verified.\n\n294\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.910\nAnd so I can use Kerberos for that.\n\n295\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.520\nThis is a way I can set up\nisolation networks where I can only\n\n296\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.760\nallow domain traffic to talk\nto my server for example.\n\n297\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.270\nMaybe I'm not worried about encrypting it\nas much as making sure somebody that's not\n\n298\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.920\npart of my domain, a guest computer\nthat comes into my network,\n\n299\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.090\nshouldn't be allowed to\nconnect to this file server.\n\n300\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.800\nAll right, we can use IPsec to prevent\nthat, cuz we can set it up to where yeah,\n\n301\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.580\nencrypt it or don't encrypt it, I'm okay.\n\n302\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.740\nBut you have to authenticate,\nand you have to use Kerberos.\n\n303\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.570\nThey're not part of my domain.\n\n304\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.820\nThey're not gonna be able to authenticate.\n\n305\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.490\nYou can also use certificates,\n\n306\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.240\nwhich is a way if I need to allow people\nthat are not part of my domain to\n\n307\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.690\nestablish this secure connection,\ncertificates are the way to go.\n\n308\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.120\nBecause I can issue certificates\nto non-domain members.\n\n309\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.770\nAnd those certificates\nare issued by my CA, so\n\n310\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.860\nthey'll be trusted within my network.\n\n311\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.620\nAnd I can allow them to\nestablish that connection.\n\n312\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.640\nSo if I've got a vendor that comes\ninto my network that does work,\n\n313\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.420\nthat has to connect to that server.\n\n314\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.650\nAnd I want that connection to be secure,\nor at least authenticate it.\n\n315\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.102\nI can say, I'll issue you a certificate,\nyou install it on your laptop and\n\n316\n00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:55.148\nnow you can set up this IP SEC total\nconnection and we're good to go.\n\n317\n00:15:55.148 --> 00:15:57.468\nYou can also do pre-shared keys.\n\n318\n00:15:57.468 --> 00:16:00.460\nWhich is a weaker way.\n\n319\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.992\nBut I could,\nif I don't have a CA in-house,\n\n320\n00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:05.992\nif I don't have a PKI public\nkey infrastructure, and\n\n321\n00:16:05.992 --> 00:16:10.950\nI don't want to bother to set that up, cuz\nwe're small, I could use a pre-shared key.\n\n322\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.606\nAnd then when that vendor comes in,\nI can say, here's the pre-shared key,\n\n323\n00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:18.270\nmy passphrase, that I want you to use\nwhen you establish that connection.\n\n324\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.720\nI'll leave it on Kerberos just\nto make things simple, Finish.\n\n325\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.610\nAnd now I've got my demo rule, and\nnotice I'm back out to the beginning and\n\n326\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.930\nI can click OK.\n\n327\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.330\nSo a lot went into creating that rule,\n\n328\n00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.010\nI know that was a 90 mile an hour\ncruise through the creation of it.\n\n329\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.180\nBut this is for GIAC GSEC.\n\n330\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.940\nIt's not a Windows test, so\n\n331\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.990\nthey're not gonna get you real heavy\non the inner workings of this.\n\n332\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.980\nIt's more about understanding\nwhat we can do.\n\n333\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.410\nIf you ever need to make a change,\n\n334\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.070\nyou can always go back in and\npull up the properties.\n\n335\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.370\nAnd you can edit each one of those pieces,\nand you can get pretty deep.\n\n336\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.620\nYou can see I've clicked Edit three times,\nto get all the way into the filter.\n\n337\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.130\nAgain, like I said,\nit can get a little bit twisty.\n\n338\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.280\nAll right, now.\n\n339\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.810\nNext thing I'm gonna do,\nonce I've got my policy,\n\n340\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.540\nI'm gonna use the one I created earlier.\n\n341\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.390\nIf we want to take a look at that,\nit was just filtering that ICMP.\n\n342\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.080\nIt's using Kerberos as\nthe authentication method.\n\n343\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.940\nIt is not setting up a tunnel,\nand it's only for LAN traffic.\n\n344\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.570\nSo that is the filter that's\ncurrently selected in this policy.\n\n345\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.280\nIf I was to click Edit,\nyou can see I've got my ICMP rule.\n\n346\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.160\nWhich is saying, if it is any,\nany, source port.\n\n347\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.730\nAny, any, destination.\n\n348\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.680\nSource port, destination port IP, any any.\n\n349\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.900\nAnd protocol, ICMP, right?\n\n350\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.750\nSo only if it's ICMP traffic\nis that going to kick in.\n\n351\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.790\nConnection type.\n\n352\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.600\nI got a local area network.\n\n353\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.650\nAuthentication methods.\n\n354\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.680\nAgain, Kerberos.\n\n355\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.090\nSo all of that can be changed after\nthe fact when you create these policies.\n\n356\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.260\nTo make sure this policy's in place,\nI'm gonna right-click on my policy and\n\n357\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.030\nchoose Assign.\n\n358\n00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.130\nAgain, normally we're doing this\nthrough Group Policy on many\n\n359\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.600\nmachines at the same time,\nnot individually.\n\n360\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.262\nBut now I've got that enabled.\n\n361\n00:18:08.262 --> 00:18:09.482\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n362\n00:18:09.482 --> 00:18:11.400\nActually, you know what,\nlet's disable this.\n\n363\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.330\nLet's prove something to ourselves.\n\n364\n00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.720\nI'm gonna unassign it.\n\n365\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.760\nI'm gonna go to my client.\n\n366\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.950\nI'm gonna pull up the command prompt.\n\n367\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.710\nAnd I'm gonna ping F1.\n\n368\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.910\nAnd it goes across to the network,\n\n369\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.630\nno problem, cuz all my firewalls\nare allowing ICMP traffic, right?\n\n370\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.010\nNow I'm gonna switch back over to app1,\nmy server.\n\n371\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.250\nAnd I'm going to enable secure ICMP.\n\n372\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.570\nI'm gonna assign that policy, so\nnow it is going to be enforced.\n\n373\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.929\nSwitch back over to client one.\n\n374\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.500\nAnd we'll just up arrow.\n\n375\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.855\nWe'll try to do a little ping again.\n\n376\n00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:49.240\nHmm.\n\n377\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.550\nAnd now it's not working.\n\n378\n00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.657\nI can no longer ping it.\n\n379\n00:18:51.657 --> 00:18:57.280\nBecause app one is saying, look, any ICNP\ntraffic that comes into me from any port,\n\n380\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.320\nany source IP address, I'm sorry.\n\n381\n00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.920\nAny source IP, any source.\n\n382\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200\nPort.\nWow, if I can say that.\n\n383\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.490\nI'm gonna require security, cuz I chose\nRequire Security, or Negotiate Security.\n\n384\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.025\nAnd if it's not secure,\nI said to drop the traffic.\n\n385\n00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:12.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Alright?\n\n386\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.970\nSo I'm gonna enforce that there.\n\n387\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.730\nSo you can see, it's not allowed.\n\n388\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.560\nIt can't ping it, because we can't\nestablish a secure connection first.\n\n389\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.855\nAnd the server's just saying nope,\nI ain't talking to you.\n\n390\n00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:24.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're not securing it.\n\n391\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.490\nThis brings me back to the other\npoint I wanted to make earlier.\n\n392\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.560\nWhen you're working with IPSec.\n\n393\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.570\nBoth ends of the conversation have\nto be set up with a policy, and\n\n394\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.830\nthose policies have to agree, okay?\n\n395\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.580\nIf one end has an IPSec policy, even\nif it said, well, I shouldn't say that.\n\n396\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.230\nIf one end has an IPSec policy,\nand the other end does not.\n\n397\n00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.330\nIf this end is saying Require Security,\nand\n\n398\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.300\nthe other end doesn't understand IPsec,\nit's not gonna connect.\n\n399\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.790\nRight?\n\n400\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.080\nIf they're using different methods,\nif one end is set to use Kerberos for\n\n401\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.990\nauthentication.\n\n402\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.850\nThe other end does have an IPsec policy,\nbut it's set to use certificates for\n\n403\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.920\nauthentication.\n\n404\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.610\nIt's not gonna connect.\n\n405\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.320\n&gt;&gt; No bueno.\n[LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.095\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n407\n00:20:04.095 --> 00:20:08.690\nYour policies have to be in place on\neither end of the conversation, and\n\n408\n00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.240\nthey have to agree.\n\n409\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.710\nThey will negotiate.\n\n410\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.040\nYou could have your server saying,\n\n411\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.180\nI will accept many different\nform of authentication.\n\n412\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.620\nAnd then your client says,\nthis is what I can do.\n\n413\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.110\nThey'll negotiate the strongest\nmethod that they both understand,\n\n414\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.000\nwhen it comes to the authentication.\n\n415\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.640\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.170\nSo now we need to fix up the client.\n\n417\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.790\nI'm going to actually use\ngroup policy to fix my client.\n\n418\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.520\nSo, I'm going to flip over\nto the domain controller.\n\n419\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.299\nAnd I'm going to open up my\ngroup policy management console.\n\n420\n00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:40.560\nAnd I've got a policy\nalready called IPSec.\n\n421\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.950\nI just disabled it earlier.\n\n422\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.560\nI'm going to go ahead and\nenable that again.\n\n423\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.260\nBut in this policy, I did the same\nthing I was just showing you.\n\n424\n00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:55.960\nIf I go down to Windows and Security, and\nall the way down to IP Security Policies.\n\n425\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.050\nI can see, there is those rules\nI was talking about earlier.\n\n426\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.100\nClient respond only.\n\n427\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.280\nServer request security.\n\n428\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.916\nAnd security server, require security.\n\n429\n00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:09.530\nWell,l I'm going to in the policy,\nenable client respond only.\n\n430\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:14.180\nWe can create our own policies here,\nand it launches the exact same wizard.\n\n431\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.620\nSo this is how you do it in\na corporate environment, where\n\n432\n00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.410\nyou've got to touch multiple machines,\nrather than doing what I did on app1.\n\n433\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.652\nWhich was to configure\nthe policy on just that machine.\n\n434\n00:21:24.652 --> 00:21:27.750\nAll right, so I've enabled that policy,\nclient respond only.\n\n435\n00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:33.130\nI've linked this policy to the OU\nthat contains my client computers.\n\n436\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.770\nSo I'm going to go to the client,\nif I can remember how to do that.\n\n437\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.880\nAnd I'm going to ping.\n\n438\n00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.620\nLet's see if anybody knows\nwhat's going wrong here.\n\n439\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.593\nI'm gonna ping app1.\n\n440\n00:21:47.845 --> 00:21:49.720\nStill not working.\n\n441\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.580\nBut I know I've got a policy,\nand it should match.\n\n442\n00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.410\nI configured it the same way.\n\n443\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.340\nRemember, group policy doesn't\ntake effect immediately.\n\n444\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.590\nYou have to refresh policy, or wait for\npolicy to refresh, or reboot the machine\n\n445\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.890\nin the case of a computer setting,\nor wait 90 minutes by default.\n\n446\n00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.480\nSo let's do a little GP\nupdate switch force,\n\n447\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.280\nto reapply group policy\non this client machine.\n\n448\n00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.030\n&gt;&gt; And you're just, Pushing that rule,\nthat policy out right now.\n\n449\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm saying, hey Mr. Client, rather than\nwait 90 minutes for your normal refresh\n\n450\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.480\ncycle, go check and see if there's\nany new policies and pull them down.\n\n451\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.030\nActually, the force switch says,\ngo get all policies and reapply them,\n\n452\n00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.720\njust in case anything has changed.\n\n453\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've refreshed policy.\n\n454\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.376\nNow I'm gonna ping app1.\n\n455\n00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:38.590\nAnd ta-da.\n\n456\n00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.450\nYou might have noticed, if you were\nwatching really, really closely.\n\n457\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.010\nRight before that first ping,\nthere was a brief hesitation.\n\n458\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.950\nAnd then, it started pinging, and\nthey were going through like normal.\n\n459\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.485\nThat brief hesitation there?\n\n460\n00:22:51.485 --> 00:22:54.720\nThat was the negotiation going\non between the two machines.\n\n461\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.922\nIf I go back over to, not him.\n\n462\n00:22:59.922 --> 00:23:04.801\nIf I go back over to app1 and\nI look at my IP security monitor,\n\n463\n00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:09.125\nwe'll see that I have\na security association set up.\n\n464\n00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:13.282\nBetween the server itself,\n10.0.100.200, and the peer,\n\n465\n00:23:13.282 --> 00:23:16.110\n10.0.100.10, which is the client.\n\n466\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.980\nAll right, and they've used Kerberos for\nauthentication.\n\n467\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.330\nThey're actually encrypting with\ntriple DES and they're using SHA-1 for\n\n468\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.280\nthe integrity checks.\n\n469\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.450\nFor applying those check sums to it.\n\n470\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.360\nRight?\nIf I go under quick mode, I might or\n\n471\n00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.690\nmight not have an association there.\n\n472\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.180\nIt looks like I do.\n\n473\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.182\nBut if I refresh,\nthat might actually go away.\n\n474\n00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:40.090\nWith IPSec, last thing.\n\n475\n00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.050\nI promise I'll hush about IPSec.\n\n476\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.330\nLast thing I want to say about it, though.\n\n477\n00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.610\nWhen you, what's a good way to put this?\n\n478\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.390\nYou get two associations\nthat actually go on.\n\n479\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.812\nThere's what's called the main\nmode association, and\n\n480\n00:23:51.812 --> 00:23:53.281\nthen the quick mode association.\n\n481\n00:23:53.281 --> 00:23:56.705\nThe main mode, when these two\ncomputers first start talking to\n\n482\n00:23:56.705 --> 00:23:59.300\neach other They've gotta\ndo the negotiation.\n\n483\n00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.420\nThey've gotta say, alright here's what\nI'm going to accept what can you do?\n\n484\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.100\nLet's figure out how we're going to\n\n485\n00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.020\nestablish-\n&gt;&gt; Phases.\n\n486\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.590\n&gt;&gt; the secure connection.\n\n487\n00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.020\nWhat's that?\n&gt;&gt; Like in phases.\n\n488\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n489\n00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.250\nLet's get everything set up.\n\n490\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.920\nLet's establish.\n\n491\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.600\nLet me verify who you are.\n\n492\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.390\nAuthenticate you.\n\n493\n00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.360\nYou authenticate me.\n\n494\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.380\nWe establish all the ground work.\n\n495\n00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.940\nNow we can go ahead and\nset up our Quick mode association.\n\n496\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.370\nNotice the main mode includes\nthe authentication, the encryption,\n\n497\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.760\nthe integrity.\n\n498\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.480\nWe go to the quick mode, and really\njust seeing source, and destination, and\n\n499\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.090\nme esp.\n\n500\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.450\nI didn't enable authentication header.\n\n501\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.660\nSo, I have my encryption there.\n\n502\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.820\nThe way this works.\n\n503\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.970\nThe main mode can be,\nit has a longer lifetime.\n\n504\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.350\nOnce you've established that\nthe main mode has a lifetime\n\n505\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.260\nof I think by default eight hours.\n\n506\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.820\nThe quick mode is only established for\nthat particular connection and\n\n507\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.030\nthen once I'm done\ncommunicating it will go away.\n\n508\n00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.110\nIn fact if I wait just a few more\nminutes that will actually disappear.\n\n509\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.040\nBut the next time a client\nwants to talk to the server.\n\n510\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.670\nThey can skip the initial association\n\n511\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.320\nbecause they've already got the main mode\nset up and it's good for eight hours.\n\n512\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.370\nSo it speeds up the connection\nwhen you have to reconnect and\n\n513\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:10.400\nrequire that security all they have\nto do is do the quick mode part.\n\n514\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.210\nThey've already got the main mode done.\n\n515\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.730\nNow the main mode eventually goes away and\nI'll have to reestablish that.\n\n516\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.980\nBut just so you understand what\nyou're looking for in here.\n\n517\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.670\nYou know when you go and verify that\nConnections to those servers are secure.\n\n518\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.660\nSo that's a little bit\nabout good ol' IPSEC.\n\n519\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n520\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n521\n00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.308\n&gt;&gt; And that kind of segues perfectly into\nour next topic, which is our VPNs, right?\n\n522\n00:25:32.308 --> 00:25:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n523\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.410\nAnd you can use IPSec to go ahead and\nsecure a VPN tunnel.\n\n524\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.350\nSo, I don't know,\nwhere do you wanna start?\n\n525\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.722\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, there's just so\nmany things I wanna do.\n\n526\n00:25:41.722 --> 00:25:43.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I might have to break this up.\n\n527\n00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.370\nI know you're gonna be shock.\n\n528\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.330\nWe might actually have to go into a third\npart to finish all this fun stuff.\n\n529\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.170\nI do wanna tell you one or\ntwo more things about IPSec.\n\n530\n00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.720\nWhen we set up that rule,\nI specified ICMP traffic.\n\n531\n00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.240\nRight.\nThat was gonna trigger IP sec and\n\n532\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.410\ntrigger the negotiation and\nencrypt that traffic.\n\n533\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.950\nThat would of done anything\nelse to that server.\n\n534\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.420\nConnect to a share for\nexample, that would not.\n\n535\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.670\nRight because the rule is very\nspecific about what is triggering it.\n\n536\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.490\nSo you can just encrypt\ncertain types of traffic.\n\n537\n00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.730\nYou can be very specific about\nwhat needs to be protected.\n\n538\n00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:22.140\nAll right now VPNs, virtual private\nnetworks this is how we can\n\n539\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.910\nestablish a secure connection across\nan unsecure portion of our network.\n\n540\n00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.150\nBe it our own network,\ntypically public infrastructure.\n\n541\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.410\nLike from home back to work or\nfrom Starbucks back to work, or\n\n542\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.330\nfrom Corporate office to branch office,\nall right.\n\n543\n00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.280\nIt's a virtual private network.\n\n544\n00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.450\nAnd to do that, you need a VPN server,\nwhich I have set up.\n\n545\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.590\nSo if we take a look here,\nlet me bring Server Manager back up.\n\n546\n00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.760\nAnd I'll open up my Routing and\nRemote Access.\n\n547\n00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.220\nAnd I set this up earlier.\n\n548\n00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.680\nRemember, a VPN server or a remote access\nserver has to have Two network adapters,\n\n549\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.630\none connected to the network\naccepting the connections and\n\n550\n00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.640\nthe other one is gonna go to the network\nyou are trying to connect to.\n\n551\n00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.430\nSo for example, one outside the internet,\nfor my remote users and then\n\n552\n00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.480\nthe other going to my internal network\nthere and it allow between the two.\n\n553\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.200\nWhat else?\n\n554\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.290\nSo it's sitting here,\nwaiting for connections.\n\n555\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.730\nNow if I, let's see,\nI can go back over to the client.\n\n556\n00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.640\nAnd let's pick up, let's try to connect.\n\n557\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.000\nIf I, let's do this, what I need to do\n\n558\n00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.290\nIs I need to take this client right now\nit's on the same network as app one.\n\n559\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.060\nIt's in the corporate network so\nI need to pretend my client\n\n560\n00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.320\nis now remote at the hotel,\nat home, or something like that.\n\n561\n00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.960\nI'm gonna use my\nvirtualization technologies\n\n562\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.840\nto bump the client to a different network.\n\n563\n00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.025\nI called it pseudo external because\nit's not really external we're just\n\n564\n00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:58.628\npretending My VMs do not have an internet\naccess cuz they're not patch manage,\n\n565\n00:27:58.628 --> 00:28:03.727\nand now we're flip back over the client\nand I need to give an IP address cuz\n\n566\n00:28:03.727 --> 00:28:09.112\nthere's no DACP out here, so let me\nreal quick assign some TCP IP settings.\n\n567\n00:28:11.652 --> 00:28:14.107\nWe'll go into properties, IPv4.\n\n568\n00:28:15.176 --> 00:28:20.434\nAnd 16, 02.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're doing here is we're\n\n569\n00:28:20.434 --> 00:28:24.930\njust prepping this machine.\n\n570\n00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.860\nWe're going to be looking at to\nestablish a client to a VPN connection.\n\n571\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.905\nIs that what's going on Mike?\n\n572\n00:28:29.905 --> 00:28:30.870\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm, exactly right.\n\n573\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.610\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n574\n00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.460\nSo on app one,\n\n575\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.090\nlet me make this finish just to make\nsure everything goes correctly here\n\n576\n00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.920\nas it applies in those changes,\nthinks about applying those changes.\n\n577\n00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.070\nWe'll come back and\ncheck on it in a second.\n\n578\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.470\nSo yes, you are correct, Cherokee, on app\none again, I have installed the role.\n\n579\n00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.090\nRouting remote access and then once you\ndo that you right click up here and\n\n580\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.780\nI choose configure and\nenable routing remote access and\n\n581\n00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.710\nI went through the wizard to say hey which\nnetwork adapters connect to the outside?\n\n582\n00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.700\nWhich connectors,\nwhich adapters connect to the inside?\n\n583\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.640\nWhat protocols do you want to allow for\nthese remote access connection.\n\n584\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.870\nYeah, so we would just set that\nup one time on the server.\n\n585\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.260\nAnd more frequently you would have to\nset up the client machines as you had\n\n586\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.200\nnew employees and\n\n587\n00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.400\nduring the on boarding process or whom\never wanted to use that remote connection.\n\n588\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right and there what is\nthe name of that little wizard,\n\n589\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.940\nI love the name of it.\n\n590\n00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:28.314\nWizard of Oz?\n\n591\n00:29:28.314 --> 00:29:30.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a good wizard.\n\n592\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.196\nBut there's another one that you\ncan use to create a little app.\n\n593\n00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:36.611\n&gt;&gt; Gandalf.\n\n594\n00:29:36.611 --> 00:29:40.915\n[LAUGH] I don't know any other wizards.\n\n595\n00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:43.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It'll pop into my head\nin a minute and I'll think of it.\n\n596\n00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.860\nIf one of you out there in the chat\nroom thinks of it remind me.\n\n597\n00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.420\nBut there's a great little wizard,\nthe connections, CMAC, that was it.\n\n598\n00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.060\nCuz I love I call it CMAK, or CMAK,\n\n599\n00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.200\nit's the Connection Manager\nAdministration Kit that allows\n\n600\n00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.340\nyou to create VPN connection executables\nthat you can pass out to your clients.\n\n601\n00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.910\nThey can just double click on it.\n\n602\n00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.590\nIt does all the configuration\nin the background, so\n\n603\n00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.470\nyou don't have to walk them through\nright-click new connection,\n\n604\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.300\nchoose PPTP and then wait, what?\n\n605\n00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.160\nPPTP.\n\n606\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n607\n00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.590\nI mean it'll take you\nan hour to get this set up.\n\n608\n00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.350\nAnyway that's.\n\n609\n00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Save on shipping cost, that's\nsomething we used to do quite often.\n\n610\n00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.710\nJust say okay, you ship your laptop or\neven when they ordered the laptop and\n\n611\n00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.260\nyou ship it out so\n\n612\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.600\nyou can configure it or something got\nchanged, then That could be an issue.\n\n613\n00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n614\n00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.350\n&gt;&gt; You'll have to tell me\nthe name of that again.\n\n615\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.890\n&gt;&gt; The Connection Manager\nAdministration Kit, CMAK.\n\n616\n00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.280\n&gt;&gt; CMAK, I'm writing that down.\n\n617\n00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.530\n&gt;&gt; If I choose port, you'll see that\nby default, it sets up a lot of ports.\n\n618\n00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.050\nI want you to know when installing remote\naccess, it's got all of these VPN ports,\n\n619\n00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.290\nbut if you look closely\nNow what does that say?\n\n620\n00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.790\nSSTP, right?\n\n621\n00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:53.010\nWe talked about remote access protocols,\nVPN tunnels in a previous episode.\n\n622\n00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:56.260\nSSTP is my secure socket\ntunneling protocol.\n\n623\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.030\nGoes over port 443.\n\n624\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:03.030\nWe also will see and it makes 120\nThree of them if I remember correctly.\n\n625\n00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.070\n128 of them, sorry.\n\n626\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:11.070\nAnd then you see 128 PPTP,\npoint to point tunnelling ports made.\n\n627\n00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:18.850\nYou should also see 128 L2TP ports\ncreated and then 128 IKEV2 ports created.\n\n628\n00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.600\nAnd then 128, we're not gonna worry\nabout the WAN miniports for this one.\n\n629\n00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.580\n&gt;&gt; But this is what you were talking about\nwith having that negotiation between\n\n630\n00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.780\nthe client and the server to establish\nthat encryption that you'll be using,\n\n631\n00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.510\nbecause it needs to match on both sides,\nthat's really key here.\n\n632\n00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes and what you want to do,\nif you're setting up a VPN server,\n\n633\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.800\nwe talk about hardening severs, and\ndisabling unnecessary services.\n\n634\n00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.710\nWell the same thing is going to go here.\n\n635\n00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.585\nIf I know all of my clients are going\nto be using PPTP to make their remote\n\n636\n00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:53.561\naccess connection, why is my server\nlistening for SSTP connections.\n\n637\n00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:57.660\nI'm not monitoring them,\nit's not configured, we don't use it.\n\n638\n00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.979\nBut the bad guy might find it-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n639\n00:31:58.979 --> 00:32:00.347\n&gt;&gt; And try to come in across it right?\n\n640\n00:32:00.347 --> 00:32:04.511\nSo what I do is you go in here and\nyou select all these SSTP ports or\n\n641\n00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:07.680\nyou can should be able\nto right-click status.\n\n642\n00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.161\nNope, there's actually\nan easier way to do this.\n\n643\n00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:15.070\nRight-click Properties, right-click\non Ports and choose Properties.\n\n644\n00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:21.141\nAnd then I can come in here and\nfind SSTP, you can click Configure.\n\n645\n00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:26.624\nAnd I can drop that down to 0\nmaximum ports, then click OK.\n\n646\n00:32:26.624 --> 00:32:29.124\nAnd it's gonna tell me,\nif anybody is currently connected and\n\n647\n00:32:29.124 --> 00:32:31.950\nyou're dropping it down to zero,\nthey might lose their connection.\n\n648\n00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.130\nI say OK, OK.\n\n649\n00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.268\nNow if I refresh this there,\nit did change it to inactive,\n\n650\n00:32:37.268 --> 00:32:39.700\nit's not gonna remove them.\n\n651\n00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.880\nBut that's definitely something you\nwant to do, hardening your VPN server.\n\n652\n00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.810\nDecide what protocols it is you wanna use,\neliminate the other ones.\n\n653\n00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.060\nYour clients are typically set to\nautomatic, and they will negotiate.\n\n654\n00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.812\nWhat they'll do is they'll start with,\n\n655\n00:32:51.812 --> 00:32:55.224\nthey actually now start with IKEV 2,\nthat's the first one they're gonna try.\n\n656\n00:32:55.224 --> 00:32:58.367\nAnd if the remote access server\nsays I don't understand that,\n\n657\n00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:00.155\nit goes to the next one just as SSTP.\n\n658\n00:33:00.155 --> 00:33:03.150\nIf it doesn't understand\nthat it'll try the next one.\n\n659\n00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.800\nYou can hard code the client to\nchoose a particular protocol, or\n\n660\n00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.270\nyou can just leave the client\nas if try whatever.\n\n661\n00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.706\nAnd then on the server\nthat's where we harden it,\n\n662\n00:33:11.706 --> 00:33:14.960\nwe say you're only gonna accept\nthis type of connection, right?\n\n663\n00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.380\nYou also have to worry about IP addresses\nagain, I don't wanna go to deep.\n\n664\n00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.160\nI know we're getting short on time,\nthis is not a class about\n\n665\n00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.090\nsetting up routing remote access actually,\nit's more about securing it.\n\n666\n00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:24.832\n&gt;&gt; But we have those.\n\n667\n00:33:24.832 --> 00:33:26.124\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we do have those [LAUGH] in\n\n668\n00:33:26.124 --> 00:33:27.349\nthe library, absolutely.\n\n669\n00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:30.747\nCuz you do have to worry about like IP\naddresses, once this remote machine,\n\n670\n00:33:30.747 --> 00:33:34.930\nit's got an IP address that's valid on\nthe hotel network whatever that might be.\n\n671\n00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.130\nAnd it's connecting across the Internet to\nthe public facing IP of your VPN server.\n\n672\n00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.230\nBut once it establishes that tunnel,\n\n673\n00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.920\nthen you want it to talk to\nresources on your corporate network.\n\n674\n00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.136\nWell I need a valid IP address on\nthe corporate network to assign to that\n\n675\n00:33:48.136 --> 00:33:50.493\nvirtual adaptor that's\nmaking that connection.\n\n676\n00:33:50.493 --> 00:33:54.560\nAnd so you can either use DHCP\non your existing network, or\n\n677\n00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.969\nyou can provide a static\npool to your VPN server.\n\n678\n00:33:57.969 --> 00:34:01.384\nSo now that we've got it set up over here,\nI'm gonna flip back over to the client.\n\n679\n00:34:01.384 --> 00:34:04.660\nAnd we're going to make sure, there we go.\n\n680\n00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.645\nThose settings finally kicked in,\nlet's verify.\n\n681\n00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:14.610\nIf I do an ip config on my client,\nyou'll see I'm on a 172 network, right?\n\n682\n00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.670\nSo if I was to try to connect to any\nresource on the corporate network,\n\n683\n00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.980\nit shouldn't work.\n\n684\n00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:25.547\nAll right, if I go up here and\ngo \\\\ Ap1\\corpdata,\n\n685\n00:34:25.547 --> 00:34:29.063\nwhich is a shared thought on AP1.\n\n686\n00:34:29.063 --> 00:34:32.430\nIt's not gonna connect, cuz I'm at\nthe hotel, I'm not connected to work.\n\n687\n00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.809\nI can't get to resources\non the work network.\n\n688\n00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:38.880\nUnless, we set up a VPN connection.\n\n689\n00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.234\nI don't know how you set it you set it up,\nI'll run through the wizard real quick,\n\n690\n00:34:43.234 --> 00:34:44.194\njust to show you.\n\n691\n00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:47.660\nIf we go to VPN,\nyou can do Add VPN Connection.\n\n692\n00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.690\nYou choose your provider, which is\nWindows, unless your company is giving you\n\n693\n00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.360\na Cisco VPN client or something like that\nthat you've installed on your machine.\n\n694\n00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.890\nGive it a name, whoops,\nthat actually selected.\n\n695\n00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.785\nGive it a name, we'll call it asdf.\n\n696\n00:34:59.785 --> 00:35:05.540\nYour server's IP address, whatever that\nmay be, and that's not a valid IP address.\n\n697\n00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:11.258\nAnd then VPN type automatic, but I could\nspecify only connect using PPTP and\n\n698\n00:35:11.258 --> 00:35:14.129\nit won't try the other ones, right?\n\n699\n00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:15.519\nI'll leave it on automatic.\n\n700\n00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.835\nI could store my username and\npassword, please don't do that.\n\n701\n00:35:19.835 --> 00:35:22.404\nCuz then if anyone gets access to my\nlaptop, they can connect to as me.\n\n702\n00:35:22.404 --> 00:35:23.619\n&gt;&gt; Access to your corporate network.\n\n703\n00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:25.295\n&gt;&gt; Yes, never good\n&gt;&gt; Shame, shame.\n\n704\n00:35:25.295 --> 00:35:28.377\n&gt;&gt; But maybe you're using smart cards,\nor one-time passwords, or\n\n705\n00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:29.890\ncertificates, right?\n\n706\n00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.050\nWe can set all that up on the VPN server,\nand\n\n707\n00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.980\nthen the client would have\nto be configured the same.\n\n708\n00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.100\nI'm gonna cancel this out\nbecause I already have\n\n709\n00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.510\nmy VPN connection established or created.\n\n710\n00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:46.640\nSo I'm gonna select it,\nclick Connect, and there it goes.\n\n711\n00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.292\nNow it has cached my credentials, cuz I\ndidn't uncheck that little check mark.\n\n712\n00:35:50.292 --> 00:35:54.940\nSo I'm doing what I'm telling you not to\ndo and that is store your credentials.\n\n713\n00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.012\n&gt;&gt; Do as I say, not as I do, right?\n\n714\n00:35:57.012 --> 00:35:59.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's just go fix it,\n\n715\n00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:03.880\nwhat I should really do\nhere is clear sign in info.\n\n716\n00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.897\nThere we go.\nSo now it doesn't have my information.\n\n717\n00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:10.770\nSo when I go to connect to that,\nit's gonna say, hey, who are you?\n\n718\n00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:15.233\nAnd I'm gonna say, lab/Mike,\nput in my appropriate password.\n\n719\n00:36:15.233 --> 00:36:16.116\n&gt;&gt; And now you should be able\nto access those resources.\n\n720\n00:36:16.116 --> 00:36:19.699\n&gt;&gt; Click OK, and no,\nactually it didn't work.\n\n721\n00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:23.418\n&gt;&gt; Nope, and, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it goes, now it says connect.\n\n722\n00:36:23.418 --> 00:36:24.330\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n723\n00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.794\n&gt;&gt; All right, it assumed my domain so\nI did not need to include that.\n\n724\n00:36:27.794 --> 00:36:29.330\nHow can I verify?\n\n725\n00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.820\nHere's where people really get\nconfused with on these VPNs.\n\n726\n00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:40.348\nIs it says I'm connect, but nothing looks\ndifferent, hopefully that's not the same.\n\n727\n00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:45.091\nThat was for the-\n&gt;&gt; That was from-\n\n728\n00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:46.128\n&gt;&gt; Share that I tried to connect\n\n729\n00:36:46.128 --> 00:36:46.678\nto-\n&gt;&gt; Before.\n\n730\n00:36:46.678 --> 00:36:47.512\n&gt;&gt; Earlier.\n\n731\n00:36:47.512 --> 00:36:48.871\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry, I was like wait,\n\n732\n00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:50.170\nwhy is it reauthenticating me?\n\n733\n00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:50.750\nI am connected.\n\n734\n00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.903\n&gt;&gt; You are connected. Yeah, you are.\n&gt;&gt; If I look down here,\n\n735\n00:36:51.903 --> 00:36:52.851\nI can see work connected.\n\n736\n00:36:52.851 --> 00:36:56.444\nBut what people will get confused\nat here is nothing's changed.\n\n737\n00:36:56.444 --> 00:37:00.214\nIt's not like remote desktop where\nyou're remoting into another machine and\n\n738\n00:37:00.214 --> 00:37:03.185\nanother machine's desktop\nis now presented to you.\n\n739\n00:37:03.185 --> 00:37:06.445\nA VPN connection is just like you\ntook a really long network connector,\n\n740\n00:37:06.445 --> 00:37:07.485\nnetwork cable.\n\n741\n00:37:07.485 --> 00:37:10.159\nAnd ran it from wherever you\nwere all the way back to work.\n\n742\n00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:13.415\nYou're not taking over a machine\nthat's on the network.\n\n743\n00:37:13.415 --> 00:37:15.247\nYou're adding a machine to the network.\n\n744\n00:37:15.247 --> 00:37:19.317\nYou're saying this laptop is now\nphysically connected to that corporate\n\n745\n00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:21.330\nnetwork no matter where it is.\n\n746\n00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:29.116\nSo if I try to connect to that share now,\nWhat did I say, AP1/corpdocs.\n\n747\n00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:36.799\nI swear that share is over there.\n\n748\n00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:38.863\nDid I put it on the right machine?\n\n749\n00:37:38.863 --> 00:37:41.073\nLet's find out if I did.\n\n750\n00:37:41.073 --> 00:37:43.795\nI did that on the right machine,\ndid I not?\n\n751\n00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:44.810\nIt's thinking about it,\n\n752\n00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.541\nbecause it's cached the fact that\nI couldn't connect to it earlier.\n\n753\n00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:50.300\nSo it's a little irritated,\nit should pop up in a second.\n\n754\n00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.990\nLet's go double check that,\nthat share does exist.\n\n755\n00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.070\nAnd I did create it,\nI'm not just [INAUDIBLE].\n\n756\n00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.350\nOkay, yeah, corpdata's there, okay.\n\n757\n00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.430\nSo it should connect in just a minute.\n\n758\n00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:05.432\nCan't connect, check the spelling.\n\n759\n00:38:11.217 --> 00:38:13.985\nLet me just clear out a couple caches and\ntry that again.\n\n760\n00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.747\nAnd there it goes.\n\n761\n00:38:18.747 --> 00:38:22.800\nAnd we just cache the fact that I\ncouldn't connect to him earlier.\n\n762\n00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.680\nThere it goes.\n\n763\n00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.260\nOnce I'm connected,\nnow I can talk to my DNS server.\n\n764\n00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.055\nI can resolve a name AP1.\n\n765\n00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:31.678\nSo earlier when I wasn't connected and\nI tried to connect to the resource.\n\n766\n00:38:31.678 --> 00:38:36.073\nIt failed to resolve the name and it\ncached the negative entry in my DNS cache,\n\n767\n00:38:36.073 --> 00:38:39.620\nname doesn't exist, so\nit wasn't trying it again.\n\n768\n00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.720\nSo once I flush my IP config or\nflush my DNS cache I'm able to connect.\n\n769\n00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.280\nSo now I can access\nCorporate Resources securely\n\n770\n00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.960\nfrom wherever I am in the world, right?\n\n771\n00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.406\nWith that VPN server setup.\n\n772\n00:38:50.406 --> 00:38:54.124\nIf we flip back over to AP1 and\nI take a look,\n\n773\n00:38:55.893 --> 00:38:59.670\nRemote Access Clients there is lab Mike,\nright?\n\n774\n00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.870\nAll connected.\n\n775\n00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.122\nThere's another console we can\nuse now in 2016 Server, and\n\n776\n00:39:05.122 --> 00:39:08.205\nthat is the Remote Access\nmanagement server.\n\n777\n00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.853\nAnd while that's pulling up,\ncuz it's really slow.\n\n778\n00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:15.990\nI'm also gonna pull up\nthe Network Policy Server.\n\n779\n00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:20.290\nAnother thing you've gotta remember\nwhen you are configuring a VPN server\n\n780\n00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.710\nis to configure a network policy.\n\n781\n00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:28.163\nBecause by default,\nyou'll have two network policies in place,\n\n782\n00:39:28.163 --> 00:39:30.156\nyou'll have those last two.\n\n783\n00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:32.973\nConnections to Microsoft Routing\nRemote Access Server, and\n\n784\n00:39:32.973 --> 00:39:35.070\nConnections to other access servers.\n\n785\n00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.300\nBoth of them have the red x there and\nthey say deny access.\n\n786\n00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.400\nThese are your default rules\nthat block everything.\n\n787\n00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.595\nAnd then you have to go back in and\nadd your own rules, so\n\n788\n00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:46.624\nI made a rule called allow admins.\n\n789\n00:39:46.624 --> 00:39:50.170\nAnd it's actually just allowing\nany authenticated users.\n\n790\n00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.680\nBut there has to be at\nleast one policy in place,\n\n791\n00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.860\notherwise you will not be able to connect.\n\n792\n00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.120\nSo if you're troubleshooting VPNs,\nthis is where you would go.\n\n793\n00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.550\nCheck your policies, but\nthis is gonna decide who's allowed.\n\n794\n00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.477\nMaybe only the sales people are allowed\nto make these remote connections.\n\n795\n00:40:04.477 --> 00:40:07.079\nI don't want just anybody\nof my users going home and\n\n796\n00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:11.000\nthinking they can connect to the work\nnetwork when they're at home.\n\n797\n00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.280\nOr just admins are allowed to connect\nremotely, or just the help desk people so\n\n798\n00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.120\nthey can fix things.\n\n799\n00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.640\nNobody else is allowed to connect\nto the network from the outside.\n\n800\n00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.310\nAll of that is controlled\nthrough these policies.\n\n801\n00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.750\nYou can put restrictions like time and\nday restrictions.\n\n802\n00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.890\nYou can do IP range restrictions.\n\n803\n00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.590\nYou can do windows group restrictions, but\n\n804\n00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.710\nit really helps you secure\nthose VPN connections.\n\n805\n00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.593\n&gt;&gt; Well I think we do have some\nmore information to cover.\n\n806\n00:40:38.593 --> 00:40:40.845\nSo that means we're really\nat a part three, Mike.\n\n807\n00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:41.668\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for\n\n808\n00:40:41.668 --> 00:40:45.700\nbeing with us this long, and thank you\nladies and gentleman for staying tuned.\n\n809\n00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.315\nBut definitely don't change that channel,\n\n810\n00:40:47.315 --> 00:40:49.149\nbecause we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n811\n00:40:49.149 --> 00:40:52.260\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign-off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n812\n00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n813\n00:40:54.620 --> 00:41:01.990\n[MUSIC].\n\n814\n00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.936\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your GIAC\nsecurity essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.480\nThis is actually a part three and\n\n7\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260\nwe made it, and we were looking\nat Windows networking security.\n\n8\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.010\nWith us today we have Mister Mike Rodrick\nin studios, thank you for joining us Mike.\n\n9\n00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Well you're welcome Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.460\nYeah I am kind of long winded today.\n\n11\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.427\n&gt;&gt; It's all right there's\na lot to cover here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:33.748\n&gt;&gt; There is a lot of good stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:39.420\nSo we're gonna talk now about\nsecuring Windows server services.\n\n14\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.943\nJust on some best practices,\nwe'll take a look at a couple of those, or\n\n15\n00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:46.377\ntalk about at least, a couple of\nthose built-in service accounts.\n\n16\n00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:47.238\nAnd should we use them?\n\n17\n00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:48.830\nShould we not use them?\n\n18\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.620\nWhat are our alternatives?\n\n19\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.010\nSome things we should know about them.\n\n20\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.520\nBut, before we do that, I did want to show\nyou one more thing if you're watching that\n\n21\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.200\nprevious episode and\nyou're thinking to yourself,\n\n22\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.720\nman he opened up that new remote\naccess management console and\n\n23\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.610\nthen never showed it to us,\ncuz it was so slow to open.\n\n24\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.240\nI didn't forget, it's right here,\nso let's take a quick peak at it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.300\nAll right, a relatively new console, and\n\n26\n00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.930\nit's called the remote access management\nconsole, and it's, It's pretty nice.\n\n27\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.840\nIt allows me to monitor\nmy VPN connections.\n\n28\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.860\nGot this dashboard that is showing\nme that my operational status for\n\n29\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.240\napp one is up and running.\n\n30\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.550\nMy services, my VPN addressing,\nmy connectivity all looking good.\n\n31\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.120\nAnd I can see some information about\nmy clients that are connected.\n\n32\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.384\nHow much data's gone back and\nforth how many connections and\n\n33\n00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:36.990\nthat's just the dashboard.\n\n34\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.310\nYou can go into the operational status\npage and see your different VPN servers.\n\n35\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450\nI've got my remote client status and\nI can see that client that we were\n\n36\n00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.090\nusing in the previous\nepisode is still connected.\n\n37\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.150\nI can see the IP addresses down here.\n\n38\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.070\nThere are some protocol information\nsome authentication information.\n\n39\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.730\nI can even right click on that guy and\nchoose details and\n\n40\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.650\nget some more detailed\ninformation about the connection.\n\n41\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.250\nAnd where they're connecting from.\n\n42\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.540\nHow long they've been connected?\n\n43\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.870\nWhat kind of rate data transfer\nrates they're getting.\n\n44\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.810\nSo pretty neat information that you\ncan get there from this new console.\n\n45\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.340\nJust wanted to point\nthat out to everybody.\n\n46\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.990\nAll right.\n\n47\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.490\nSo now, we'll talk about the-\n&gt;&gt; Services.\n\n48\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nService accounts.\n\n49\n00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Securing Windows server services.\n\n50\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.890\nA service something that runs that\nprovides some type of functionality,\n\n51\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.840\nsome type of functionality.\n\n52\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.650\nLike the DHTP server service,\nis a service that's designed to listen for\n\n53\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.150\nand respond to DACP discover packets, and\n\n54\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.470\nprovide TCPIP configuration\nautomatically to machines on my network.\n\n55\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.600\nDNS is a service that provides\nname resolution, functionality.\n\n56\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.520\nSQL, is a database service that we can\nconnect to and work with databases.\n\n57\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.250\nHeck, Active Directory is a service,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.190\nBut these services need\naccounts to run under.\n\n59\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.560\nThey don't run in just kinda ether and\nmagic.\n\n60\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.460\nThey have to access resources.\n\n61\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.910\nWe need to log what they're doing, so\nwe need to assign an account to them\n\n62\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.870\nthat gives them the rights to run, the\nright to access resources if they need to.\n\n63\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.435\nWe can track what's going on\nwith that particular service,\n\n64\n00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:24.400\nIIS is another one that has many\nservice accounts that it uses.\n\n65\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.750\nI know setting up exchange\n\n66\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.310\nis one of those where you end up\ncreating lots of service accounts.\n\n67\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.540\nOr you don't, you create one account and\n\n68\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.250\nyou do everything the way\nyou're not supposed to do.\n\n69\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.760\nAnd use that same account for\nall kinds of stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.460\nBut anyway the point is these\nthings need accounts to run under.\n\n71\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.960\nThat gives them the authority to\nstart up and access resources so\n\n72\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.300\nwe can track them, we got accountability\nby logging those service accounts.\n\n73\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.350\nWindows has several built in\naccounts that we can use for\n\n74\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.870\nservices, and as you install some\nservices windows picks one for\n\n75\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.710\nyou, you can usually go back in and\nchange that.\n\n76\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.630\nSome services like SQL or\nExchange as you're installing those\n\n77\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.370\napplications it's gonna tell you you\nneed to assign a service account.\n\n78\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.020\nAnd so what you should do is,\nas a best practice before you install it,\n\n79\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.400\nyou read through your prereqs and\nyou realize I'm gonna need three accounts.\n\n80\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.550\nOne of them is gonna need this level\nof access, the other two are gonna need\n\n81\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.040\nthis level of access, and\nyou create all that ahead of time.\n\n82\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.140\nAnd then, as you're going through\nthe installation wizard, it says,\n\n83\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.070\nwhat account would you like to use to\nbe your, to run the MS SQL service,\n\n84\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.380\nif it's a SQL server, and\nyou pick one of those accounts.\n\n85\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.770\nWhat account are you gonna use for\nthe database service, and\n\n86\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.640\nyou go pick one of those\naccounts that you created.\n\n87\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.450\nSo, let's talk about some\nof those built in accounts.\n\n88\n00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.250\nThere is the built in local,\nsystem account.\n\n89\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.155\nThere's the built in\nlocal service account.\n\n90\n00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.688\nThere's the built in\nnetwork service account.\n\n91\n00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:55.588\nAnd I guess those are the big three\nthat we wanna talk about that they call\n\n92\n00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:57.580\nout on our objectives here.\n\n93\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.340\nAnd first thing I wanna do is define what\nthese service accounts get as rights and\n\n94\n00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.340\npermissions.\n\n95\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.330\nBecause if we're gonna use them we need to\nunderstand what they're going to allow.\n\n96\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.570\nBecause we don't want to just.\n\n97\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.220\nWe want to follow the principle\nof lease privilege.\n\n98\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.790\nRight?\nWe talk about this all the time.\n\n99\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.000\nWe only assign the rights and permissions\nthat somebody needs to do their job, and\n\n100\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.130\nnothing more because if we give them more\neither intentionally or maliciously or\n\n101\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.270\nunintentionally, they're gonna take\nadvantage of those extra rights and\n\n102\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.930\nthey're gonna do something that's\ngonna cause problems to the computer\n\n103\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.250\nto the network, other computers,\nwho knows what.\n\n104\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.660\nWe don't do it to be cruel.\n\n105\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, you just dont want\nto haphazardly be doling\n\n106\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.400\nout administrative accounts because then\nwell it's gonna come back to you, right?\n\n107\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely it is.\n\n108\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.550\nI remember a great story.\n\n109\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.950\nThis was years ago, but\n\n110\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.110\nI had one of my students back when I\ntaught primarily the server classes.\n\n111\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.762\nHe had taken my classes.\n\n112\n00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:55.045\nGot his MCSA, got his MCSE.\n\n113\n00:05:55.045 --> 00:06:00.330\nWent and got a job here locally,\ncame back to me a few weeks later.\n\n114\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.840\nHe said you're not believe this.\n\n115\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.770\nI just had to come by and tell you.\n\n116\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.510\nCause we had talked.\n\n117\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.880\nOf course I taught about the principle\nof least privilege and things like that.\n\n118\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.250\nAnd he said so at this network that I'm\nnow administering and that I'm in charge\n\n119\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.170\nof every single user on the network\nwas in the domain admins group.\n\n120\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you know what that tells me?\n\n121\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.400\nThat tells me that that was a previous,\nthe previous admin was just lazy because\n\n122\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.170\ninstead of individually going to that\nsystem and installing a piece of software\n\n123\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.380\nallowing them to have access to network\nresources, they just said I'm gonna\n\n124\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.885\nlet you do whatever you wanna do, because\nI don't wanna have to do it myself.\n\n125\n00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:35.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n126\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.200\nit's the lazy admin way\nof getting things done.\n\n127\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.280\nAnd it's a great story.\n\n128\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.740\nAnd he was like how do\nI go about fixing this?\n\n129\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.415\nAnd I was like the first\nthing you're gonna have to do\n\n130\n00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:44.715\nis get administrative buy in.\n\n131\n00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.775\nBecause your users are now used\nto having administrative rights.\n\n132\n00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:48.915\n&gt;&gt; They're not going to\nbe happy about that.\n\n133\n00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:49.756\nThey can do anything they want.\n\n134\n00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:51.005\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nThey can install software.\n\n135\n00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:51.625\nWhatever.\n\n136\n00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:53.315\nSoon as you take it away, yeah,\nthey're going to be unhappy.\n\n137\n00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:54.255\n&gt;&gt; You're going to hear it.\n\n138\n00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:58.136\nSo you better have management backing\nyou up before you start anything.\n\n139\n00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:00.153\nBut anyway, that's another story,\nwe'll talk about that another day.\n\n140\n00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:05.662\nSo back to this, the same principle\nneeds to be applied here.\n\n141\n00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:08.392\nIf what I'm setting up a service or\n\n142\n00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:12.262\nI'm installing an application that\nneeds to run under an account,\n\n143\n00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:15.322\nthe easiest way to do it would be\nto just create a new administrator.\n\n144\n00:07:15.322 --> 00:07:18.001\nCreate a new account,\ngive it administrative rights,\n\n145\n00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:21.470\nassign it to that application,\nand bada-bing we're done.\n\n146\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.830\nI'm not gonna have any errors,\nthat applications gonna have no problem\n\n147\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.160\nrunning, accessing whatever it needs and\nwe're gonna be good to go.\n\n148\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.490\nSo it will work.\n\n149\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.390\nBut the problem is if somebody\ncompromises that service account.\n\n150\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.030\nNow, they've got administrative access.\n\n151\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwith the privilege escalation attacks-\n\n152\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.405\n&gt;&gt; And they don't even need the privilege\n\n153\n00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:42.300\nescalation-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're already an administrator,\n\n154\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.050\nyeah so it is just a very bad,\nbad thing, right?\n\n155\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.203\nI must say there's lot of times\nthat you have to do this.\n\n156\n00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:54.561\nI have seen some applications that require\nat least local administrative access And\n\n157\n00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:58.040\nyou have to do it if you choose\nto run that application.\n\n158\n00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.499\nMaybe if I had a different application\nthat doesn't have those needs or\n\n159\n00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:04.700\nsome other way to monitor and\nsecure that application.\n\n160\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.490\nBut we always wanna follow that\nprinciple least privilege.\n\n161\n00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.510\nLet's talk about these different\naccounts then that we can use.\n\n162\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.190\nThe built in local system account,\n\n163\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.150\nwhich is one that sometimes will get\nassigned by default applications.\n\n164\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.670\nThe local system account is\nthe local administrator basically.\n\n165\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.320\nIn fact it has a few more rights than\neven the administrator does if you can\n\n166\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.680\nimagine that.\n\n167\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.660\nBut it basically you can consider\nit a local admin on that machine.\n\n168\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:37.200\nSo if I go to a service and\nI assign that account then it's\n\n169\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.000\ngonna have administrative rights on the\nmachine, which again we might or not need.\n\n170\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.930\nAs far as network access goes for\n\n171\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.710\nthe local system account,\nit's gonna impersonate the local computer.\n\n172\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.140\nSo it can reach out that service account\ncan reach out talk to other machine\n\n173\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.330\non the network, but\nit's gonna be as the computer account.\n\n174\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.950\nSo if you use computers in\nyour security groups and\n\n175\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.310\nhad added this computer account to a group\nit would have those permissions and\n\n176\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.910\nrights associated with that group, right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.710\nIf you did this on a domaining controller,\nplease don't.\n\n178\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.430\nThere is a local system account\non the domain controller, but\n\n179\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.570\nit's now a domain admin it has\nfull rights to Active Directory,\n\n180\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.420\nwhich is probably not\ngoing to be a good thing.\n\n181\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.290\nThese accounts the local system account\ndoes have a password associated with it.\n\n182\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.720\nWe don't manage it, Windows manages it.\n\n183\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.990\nChanges it about every\nseven days on its own so\n\n184\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.720\nwe don't have to worry about that,\nall right?\n\n185\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.630\nAnd passwords for service accounts\nare a problem that we have to deal with.\n\n186\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.520\nWe'll come back to that\nconcept when we get through\n\n187\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.600\ntalking about these other accounts.\n\n188\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.184\nSo don't let me forget Cherokee,\nI like to do that.\n\n189\n00:09:42.184 --> 00:09:43.852\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n190\n00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Then you've got so\nthat's the local system account.\n\n191\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.720\nThen you've got the local service account,\nsounds similar but it's not, right?\n\n192\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.510\nIt's an account that is basically\na member of the Local Users Group.\n\n193\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.200\nSo any rights that were signed,\npermissions that are signed to\n\n194\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.070\nthe Local Users Group, this service\naccount would have those same rights.\n\n195\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.350\nIt does have network access but\nit accesses it as anonymous.\n\n196\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.000\nSo if you have used anonymous, or\nallowed anonymous access to anyone on\n\n197\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.720\nthe network the service account\ncould reach out and use those.\n\n198\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.150\nIt's basically null or anonymous.\n\n199\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.480\nThere's no password associated\nwith a local service account, so\n\n200\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.750\nyou don't have to worry\nabout changing the password.\n\n201\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.250\nSo this is an account\nagain that we can use.\n\n202\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.590\nThere's another one called the built\nin network service account.\n\n203\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.870\nAnd this is a lot like the local\nservice account in the fact that\n\n204\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.170\nit's similar to a local user as far as\nwhat rights and permissions it has.\n\n205\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.730\nIt can access the network but it does it\nas the computer account not anonymous.\n\n206\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.620\nSo now all of a sudden I can give it\naccess to other resources on the network,\n\n207\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.810\nusing the computer account to accomplish\nthat, but it still has an null password.\n\n208\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.710\nNo password associated with it so\n\n209\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.090\nwe don't have to worry about\nchanging it or anything like that.\n\n210\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.940\nSo these are the three\naccounts that we have, and\n\n211\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.250\nthen we can also create our own accounts.\n\n212\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.990\nIf I don't wanna use one\nof those built in accounts,\n\n213\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.000\nand really this is the best practice.\n\n214\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.090\nI can use those built in accounts, I mean\nthat's what they're for, but when we talk\n\n215\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.770\nabout principle of least privilege,\nwe're really trying to say is limit.\n\n216\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.520\nIt only give it what it needs.\n\n217\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.040\nSo if I have an application\nthat needs an account,\n\n218\n00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.422\nwhat I'm gonna do instead of using one\nof those built in service accounts.\n\n219\n00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:34.960\nI'm gonna create my own user account,\ncuz that’s all a service account is.\n\n220\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.920\nIs a user account that’s been given\nthe rights to log on as a service?\n\n221\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.000\nSo I'm gonna create a user account, and\n\n222\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.600\nI'm gonna assign only the permissions that\nthat particular application needs, right?\n\n223\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.200\nIf it's network access or it's not,\n\n224\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.840\nor if it's access to a file\nresource on another server.\n\n225\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.500\nI can assign that user, right?\n\n226\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.240\nThose permissions, or add it to a group\nand assign those permissions to a group\n\n227\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.380\nand now I can really restrict what that\nservice account is allowed to access.\n\n228\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.430\nOnly what I specify,\nis it allowed to access.\n\n229\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.320\nThis is your best practice.\n\n230\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.920\nIf it's an application that doesn't\nneed access to the network or\n\n231\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.500\ndomain resources,\na local user account is the way to go.\n\n232\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.620\nIf it needs access to domain resources\nthen a domain user account is what I do.\n\n233\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.670\nI go to active directory and\nmake a new user, and I start there.\n\n234\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.520\nAnd then I limit what that account has and\n\n235\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.960\nI tell that service to\nrun under that account.\n\n236\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.680\nAnd now I can access domain\nresources assuming I assign those\n\n237\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.700\npermissions appropriately, right?\n\n238\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.870\nThere's advantages and\ndisadvantages to that I guess.\n\n239\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.400\nThat is the secure way to go,\nbut as soon as I do that,\n\n240\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.530\none thing I'm gonna have to\nworry about now is passwords.\n\n241\n00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.800\nBecause it is a standard user\naccount whether it's local, or\n\n242\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.290\nwhether it's domain, it has to follow all\nthe policies that I have in place for\n\n243\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.490\nall my user accounts.\n\n244\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.895\nThat means changing my password every so\noften, right?\n\n245\n00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:03.620\nCuz most of us in our domain have to\nchange a password every 30 days or\n\n246\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.520\nwhatever that means or\nwhatever your policy is.\n\n247\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.160\nSo now this service account that I've\ncreated has to follow those rules too.\n\n248\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.910\nAnd the problem with that is will\nprompt a user to change their password.\n\n249\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.470\nHey, it's been 30 days,\ntime to change your password, right?\n\n250\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.470\nBut nobody logs on as the service account,\nit's not an everyday logon account.\n\n251\n00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.430\nNobody gets the notification that\nthe password's ready to expire.\n\n252\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.295\nSo what happens is all of the sudden\nSQL is no longer accessible.\n\n253\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.030\nOr your queries that run every night\nto generate your reports fail.\n\n254\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.280\nAnd you start troubleshooting and\ntrying to figure out why,\n\n255\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.100\nand it's because the SQL Server\nservice account's password is expired.\n\n256\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.000\n&gt;&gt; So what should we do in this situation?\n\n257\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good question Cherokee.\n\n258\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.070\nI will tell you there's a few different\nways you can solve this problem.\n\n259\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.690\nWe can set the password to never\nexpire on that particular user account\n\n260\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.150\nwhich will override my domain policies.\n\n261\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.140\nDo you think that's a good idea?\n\n262\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.850\n&gt;&gt; To what?\n\n263\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.140\n&gt;&gt; To set it to never expire?\n\n264\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.255\n&gt;&gt; Probably not never, but\nmaybe you could length and that duration.\n\n265\n00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the problem with never expire\nmeans I'm giving the bad guy forever\n\n266\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.280\n&gt;&gt; An opportunity, yeah.\n\n267\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.780\n&gt;&gt; To break the password.\n\n268\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.572\nSo you could take a year to break it,\nit comes back a year later,\n\n269\n00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:20.620\nsure enough that account is\nstill using that same password.\n\n270\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.900\nSo if you're gonna use that option and we\nused to use this option in our networks.\n\n271\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.620\nWe also made a 64 character password so\n\n272\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.810\nthat it would take you more than\na year to hopefully crack that.\n\n273\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.583\nBut gosh forbid you ever had to log\non as that account because it was 64\n\n274\n00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:33.338\ncharacters long.\n\n275\n00:14:33.338 --> 00:14:34.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't mistype.\n\n276\n00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:37.930\n&gt;&gt; And it was a pain, it was a nightmare.\n\n277\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.480\nSo that's not a good option to do although\nit is one way you can deal with it.\n\n278\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.543\nA better option would be\nto use a resource domain.\n\n279\n00:14:47.543 --> 00:14:55.681\nCuz remember, the big problem here\nis at least until 2008, 2008 R2.\n\n280\n00:14:55.681 --> 00:14:59.030\nThe problem was you can only have\none password policy per domain.\n\n281\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.370\nAnd that password policy applied\nto everybody in the domain,\n\n282\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.370\nfrom the domain admin all\nthe way down to a basic user.\n\n283\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.850\nSo what we would do is we'd\ncreate separate resource domains.\n\n284\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.300\nAnd in that resource domain, that's where\nall my service accounts are created and\n\n285\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.580\nthey would have a different\npassword policy.\n\n286\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.110\nI might say change it never, but\nrequire 64 character passwords.\n\n287\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.243\nOr yeah,\nI guess that would be a good way to do it.\n\n288\n00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.936\nBut now since Server 2008, 2008 R2,\n\n289\n00:15:24.936 --> 00:15:29.600\nI can always forget which this came out\nwith, you have managed service accounts.\n\n290\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.010\nAnd this is basically a way to\ncreate a user account that you\n\n291\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.670\nknow you're gonna use as a service, and\nWindows will manage the password for you.\n\n292\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.340\nYou never even know what the password is.\n\n293\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.110\nSo it treats it just\nlike computer accounts.\n\n294\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.480\nOr it changes it every seven\ndays in the background and\n\n295\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.990\nyou don't have to worry about it,\ncuz again, we don't know.\n\n296\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.728\nOtherwise, it's set reminders for\nyourself.\n\n297\n00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:49.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, don't forget\n\n298\n00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:53.689\nto change the exchange service\npassword on the fourth of this month.\n\n299\n00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:57.029\nThe problem is you end up with one\ncalendar That has all those different,\n\n300\n00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:58.963\nI mean it's a nightmare to try to manage.\n\n301\n00:16:00.932 --> 00:16:03.393\nSo where were we going with that?\n\n302\n00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:08.343\nAs far as passwords go for those accounts,\nthey need to be really long, we shouldn't\n\n303\n00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:13.210\nchoose the password never expires option,\nalthough that is one way to do it.\n\n304\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.570\nYou can do separate resource domains\nthat have different password policies.\n\n305\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.830\nYou can also use managed service accounts.\n\n306\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.090\nIt's not part of this exam.\n\n307\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.580\nThey don't call those out, so\nI'm not going to go into them right now.\n\n308\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Is that the portion you were telling\nme to ask you about, the passwords there?\n\n309\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.833\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n310\n00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:26.600\nWas that what I was asking you?\n\n311\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.130\n&gt;&gt; You said to have me ask\nyou about the passwords.\n\n312\n00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.482\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm sure that was it,\nI'm sure that was it.\n\n313\n00:16:31.482 --> 00:16:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.834\n&gt;&gt; If we go back and watch the episode and\n\n315\n00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:37.054\nthat wasn't it we'll have to have\nan addendum to this episode here.\n\n316\n00:16:37.054 --> 00:16:40.700\nSo managed service accounts,\nbut again not on this exam.\n\n317\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.040\nWe do do this in other shows,\nin our library.\n\n318\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.898\nLearn about them, love them,\nlive them, great things.\n\n319\n00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:53.550\nSo now, let's talk about,\nwhat was I gonna talk about?\n\n320\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.000\nSo we talk about creative\nservice accounts.\n\n321\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.430\nAccess level order, I don't know why I put\nthat, that's really not the way to say it.\n\n322\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:06.235\nBut let's talk about the best choice\nto the worst choice in order.\n\n323\n00:17:06.235 --> 00:17:09.855\nThe best choice that we could make\nis to create an account specific for\n\n324\n00:17:09.855 --> 00:17:10.785\nthis service.\n\n325\n00:17:10.785 --> 00:17:12.885\nThat's really in the end\ngoing to be the way to go.\n\n326\n00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:16.055\nWhether that's a managed account, whether\nit's a standard user account that you\n\n327\n00:17:16.055 --> 00:17:19.715\nhave to assign the permissions to and\nmanage the password yourself.\n\n328\n00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:22.625\nThat's the best way to go because\nI can truly lock it down to\n\n329\n00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.590\njust what that application needs.\n\n330\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.700\nAnd that's really what we're\ntrying to do in the end.\n\n331\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.810\nIf that's not an option, or\n\n332\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.710\nI don't wanna go that route,\nuse that built in local service account.\n\n333\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.400\nThat has access to local resources.\n\n334\n00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.120\nIt can connect to\nthe network using anonymous,\n\n335\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.980\nso we can give it access out that way.\n\n336\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.660\nI'm sorry, the local service account\nactually used the, it was anonymous.\n\n337\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:51.060\nBut it's the least privilege to count\nof those three built in account.\n\n338\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.310\nIf that won't work, if the application\nneeds network access then use\n\n339\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.280\nthe network service account, because that\naccess is uses the network instead of no,\n\n340\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.220\nIt accesses the network\nas the computer account.\n\n341\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.460\nSo now I can go to other resources.\n\n342\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.170\nI can give the computer account\nrights to those resources, or\n\n343\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.950\npermissions over those resources, and\n\n344\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.390\nnow that application will be able to\nreach out and talk to those resources.\n\n345\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.610\nMaybe it needs to log remotely.\n\n346\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.980\nMaybe it needs to access a URL,\nor like I said,\n\n347\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.390\na fileshare somewhere, so\nI can use that network service account.\n\n348\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.060\nIf that's not gonna work, if it needs,\n\n349\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.470\nmaybe it's an application that\nreally needs administrative rights.\n\n350\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.840\nIt won't run unless it has administrative\naccess to the local machine.\n\n351\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.260\nAnd there are many applications like that.\n\n352\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:43.272\nSQL was one, although I think since\nSQL These version numbers kill me.\n\n353\n00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:44.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:46.556\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft finally said, look,\n\n355\n00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:51.070\nwe're gonna make it to where you don't\nhave to run it as administrative account.\n\n356\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.440\nIt still will work in most cases.\n\n357\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.250\nYou can set it up.\n\n358\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.640\nIt is a little challenging, but\n\n359\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.120\nit can be set up to use\na non-administrative account.\n\n360\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.760\nBut the point was there are gonna\nbe times that you might need\n\n361\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.150\nto use an administrative account,\nuse that local system account.\n\n362\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.426\nIf that doesn't work you\ncan use a domain account.\n\n363\n00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:09.835\nAgain, the problem with domain accounts,\n\n364\n00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:12.450\nthey're gonna be in\nthe domain user's group.\n\n365\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.090\nSo even though I'm creating my own\naccount it's in the domain user's group.\n\n366\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.400\nAnd it has the same rights that any\nnormal user would have on your network,\n\n367\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.600\nwhich means most resources or\nwhatever you've set up.\n\n368\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.630\nRead permissions and\n\n369\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.010\nActive Directory, more permissions\nthen the application probably needs.\n\n370\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.950\nSo remove it, if you can,\nfrom those local user group.\n\n371\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.510\nIt is the thing to do.\n\n372\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.460\nSo create a local account.\n\n373\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.860\nThat's your best option,\nand then just lock it down.\n\n374\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.660\nBest practice is, don't give service\naccounts admin rights if you don't have\n\n375\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:53.090\nto, because if that account is compromised\nthe bad guy now has administrative rights.\n\n376\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.500\nDon't us a regular user's account.\n\n377\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.860\nLet me say that in a way that doesn't\ncontradict everything I've just told you.\n\n378\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.390\nYes, create a user account,\nuse that for your service.\n\n379\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.350\nWhat I'm saying is, hey, you know what?\n\n380\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.905\nI'm just gonna use my own account.\n\n381\n00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:04.499\n&gt;&gt; Bob's account, or something.\n\n382\n00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:05.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Mike, yeah.\n\n383\n00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:06.650\nSo it's Cherokee's account.\n\n384\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.950\nI've already got a user\naccount on the system,\n\n385\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.190\nI'll just have this service\nrun under my account.\n\n386\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.000\nIt's easy enough, because I know I have\nthe rights that the account needs, or\n\n387\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.520\nthat the application needs.\n\n388\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.700\nThe problem is the application now has\naccess to everything that you would have.\n\n389\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.360\nLike your personal files,\nyour documents, things like that.\n\n390\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.590\nSo if it's ever compromised,\nthere's a nice jump for\n\n391\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.410\nthat user to start seeing what else\nyou've got, what else they can get into,\n\n392\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.240\nanything that your user account has\naccess to, they can now access.\n\n393\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.090\nSo don't use an actual\nuser's valid user account.\n\n394\n00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:43.240\nCreate a special user account just for\nthat service, and lock it down.\n\n395\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.009\nDon't give it a profile.\n\n396\n00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:50.920\nThat account doesn't need a profile,\ndoesn't need all those, I don't\n\n397\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.430\nwant it setting up a folder up on our\nMy Documents redirect on our file server.\n\n398\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.490\nDon't give it remote access.\n\n399\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.410\nGo to the properties of that user\naccount that you created and\n\n400\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.140\ndisable remote access.\n\n401\n00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.800\nThat service account doesn't need to be\nmaking a VPN connection back into work, or\n\n402\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.880\nanything crazy like that.\n\n403\n00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.020\nSo I don't want the bad guys to be\nable to do it if they compromise it.\n\n404\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.370\nSo disable remote access,\nset your lock out policy.\n\n405\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.369\nLike I said, lock out policies and\nserver counts are issues\n\n406\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.490\nwith a user,\nI wanna set that lockout policy so\n\n407\n00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.140\nthat I know if somebody's\ndoing password guessing.\n\n408\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.830\nBut if I have a service account that\nhas to follow the lockout policy,\n\n409\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:40.050\nwhat can happen is the bad guys\ncan do a denial of service on me.\n\n410\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.350\nSimply by trying to log in\nwith that service account name\n\n411\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.000\nand [INAUDIBLE] for the password.\n\n412\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.850\nNo, it's not the right password but\n\n413\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.020\nif I do it five times in a row\nthat account is now locked out.\n\n414\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.042\nAnd now that service account can't run,\nso the application crashes or hangs or\n\n415\n00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:56.638\nwon't start.\n\n416\n00:21:56.638 --> 00:21:58.379\n&gt;&gt; Therefore, denial of service.\n\n417\n00:21:58.379 --> 00:22:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so don't make it easy for the\nbad guys to do a denial of service on you.\n\n418\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.108\nMake sure you set these accounts\nthat don't have, try to set it up so\n\n419\n00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:08.933\nthat they don't have lockout policies.\n\n420\n00:22:08.933 --> 00:22:13.601\nAgain, in modern Windows environments\nthis isn't difficult because we can do\n\n421\n00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:18.492\npassword policies, and I can have multiple\npassword policies in a single domain.\n\n422\n00:22:18.492 --> 00:22:23.025\nOlder domains prior to 2008.\n\n423\n00:22:23.025 --> 00:22:26.723\nNow, it was a problem, we had to make\na resource domain that had a separate\n\n424\n00:22:26.723 --> 00:22:29.980\npassword policy than everybody\nelse in the network.\n\n425\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.130\nSo take advantage of those\nmanaged service accounts.\n\n426\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.150\nUse long, strong passwords.\n\n427\n00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.340\nDon't have a lockout policy on there.\n\n428\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.150\nThe service name is another,\njust a best practice.\n\n429\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.890\nIt's not the end all of security,\nbut if I have a user account called\n\n430\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.220\nSQL Server Service, if the bad guys are\nenumerating user accounts in my network\n\n431\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.690\nand he sees one called SQL Server Service,\nhe's gonna know exactly.\n\n432\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.880\n&gt;&gt; You're making them work for\ntheir money when you change it.\n\n433\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.488\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:22:56.488 --> 00:22:58.940\n&gt;&gt; I mean, call it Bob.\n\n435\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.230\nOr use the same naming\nconvention that you use for\n\n436\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.260\nall your other user accounts If it's first\ninitial, last name, like we do here.\n\n437\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.330\nM Roderick for me, well,\nmy SQL server's account is going to be\n\n438\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.060\nM Phillip or P Jones, or something.\n\n439\n00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.070\nIt's gonna look like\nany other user account.\n\n440\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.970\nSo now at least they've got to\ngo through all the accounts,\n\n441\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.940\nto try to find out which one\nmaybe has access to SQL server.\n\n442\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.607\nSo again, not the end all in security but\nit is definitely a help.\n\n443\n00:23:26.607 --> 00:23:28.657\nAs far as other Windows services,\n\n444\n00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:33.420\nthey do call out things like IIS SQL\nterminal services on the objectives.\n\n445\n00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.990\nThe main thing is to understand\nhere that these are big targets.\n\n446\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.650\nThey have services associated with them,\nand\n\n447\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.157\nI wanna make sure that we use all of these\nbest practices when setting those up.\n\n448\n00:23:46.157 --> 00:23:47.954\nIIS doesn't ask you.\n\n449\n00:23:47.954 --> 00:23:50.179\nWhen you install IIS it just installs.\n\n450\n00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:53.219\nWhat you need to do is go\nback in after the fact and\n\n451\n00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:56.798\nchange What account those\nservices are running under.\n\n452\n00:23:56.798 --> 00:23:58.920\nLet me give you an example, here.\n\n453\n00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.120\nLet's do a quick demo.\n\n454\n00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.330\nI don't have SQL set up, but\nI have IIS on this machine.\n\n455\n00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.840\nSo, there's a couple of\nways I could do this.\n\n456\n00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.590\nI could open up my\ninformation services manager.\n\n457\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:15.760\nI could come in here and\ntake a look at my app pools, for example.\n\n458\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.290\nI can pull up the properties on this guy.\n\n459\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.080\n&gt;&gt; And to just kind of give\nthe viewers a head's up here,\n\n460\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.060\nif they're not familiar with IIS,\nthis is gong to be when a service that\n\n461\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.380\nallows any kind of Internet connectivity,\na lot of services rely on it.\n\n462\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.100\nBut if I just wanted to\nset up a web page or\n\n463\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.460\nsome kind of application that\nwanted to communicate that way.\n\n464\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sorry I was\nstudying my screen there.\n\n465\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.300\nBut yeah so\nlet me go to my basic settings.\n\n466\n00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.690\nIt's been so long since I've played with\nthis let me go to advanced settings, and\n\n467\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.390\nin here I should see there we go identity.\n\n468\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.740\nSorry I was looking right at it earlier.\n\n469\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.490\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n470\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.260\n&gt;&gt; And didn't see it, so\nI just come in here and\n\n471\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.590\nnotice it's using a built-in account\ncalled Application Pool Identity.\n\n472\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.860\nNotice if I hit my drop down list,\nwhat my other choices are.\n\n473\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.460\nIIS is much better now,\nthe later versions of IIS,\n\n474\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.120\nthis is 2016 server, so\nit's the latest version of IIS as well.\n\n475\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.270\nAnd that App Pool Identity\nis relatively locked down.\n\n476\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.140\nBut notice I could choose local service,\nlocal system and\n\n477\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.980\nnetwork service, those three accounts.\n\n478\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.190\nSo this particular app pool needed\naccess to network resources,\n\n479\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.480\nI could change this to\nnetwork service right.\n\n480\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:35.100\nOr I can choose custom account, and\nI can go browse and find an account that\n\n481\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.460\nI created specifically for this purpose\nand set it to run under those credentials.\n\n482\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.270\nSo, this is what we're talking about when\nwe talk about hardening services, and\n\n483\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:48.480\nwe talk about using service accounts,\nmanaging your applications,\n\n484\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.670\ndeciding what accounts\nthey're going to run under.\n\n485\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.391\nI could go into my services console.\n\n486\n00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:05.760\nAnd I could take a look up at, backup\nis another one you have to worry about.\n\n487\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.040\nWhat would be a good one\nto take a look at here?\n\n488\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.750\nI guess it doesn't matter.\n\n489\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.450\nHere's application identification the one\nwe're you know looking actually that's not\n\n490\n00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.120\nthe one we were looking at.\n\n491\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.940\nYeah, brain cramp here.\n\n492\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.480\nI'm just gonna grab one,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n493\n00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.250\nI'm just gonna double\nclick on any one of these.\n\n494\n00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.781\nAnd notice I have a Logon tab, okay?\n\n495\n00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:31.380\nAnd here, again, it's running by\ndefault under the local system account.\n\n496\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.290\nNow I'm not suggesting you change this for\n\n497\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.470\nthe certificate provocation\nservice that I've selected here.\n\n498\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.800\nI just randomly picked\none of these services.\n\n499\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.160\nHere, I just wanted to show you,\nyou can go to any service.\n\n500\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.820\nYou can go to the Log On tab.\n\n501\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.420\nYou can see what it's\ncurrently running under and\n\n502\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.600\nif it's inappropriate,\nyou can change it, right?\n\n503\n00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.330\nI can say, I don't want this\nrunning as the system account\n\n504\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.850\nwith administrative rights\nto the local machine.\n\n505\n00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.420\nI've already made an account\ncalled Bob one, two,\n\n506\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.970\nthree because we're gonna make\nit match the rest of our users.\n\n507\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.360\nI can say this account.\n\n508\n00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.740\nI can browse and I can find the account\nthat I want to assign to that service.\n\n509\n00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.240\nIf you're using managed service accounts,\n\n510\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.350\nthen you won't know the password\nto the account that you created.\n\n511\n00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.380\nYou go create these managed services\naccount active directory and\n\n512\n00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.950\nyou don't assign a password to it, because\nWindows is gonna manage that password.\n\n513\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:27.000\nSo if you choose to set that account here,\nall you do is blank out these passwords.\n\n514\n00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.280\nIt knows you don't know and\nit says okay, I understand wink,\n\n515\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.340\nwink I've got the password you don't\nworry about it I'll take care of it.\n\n516\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.500\nAnd so that's how we change what\naccounts services are running under.\n\n517\n00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.320\nAnd again this is, this is how we\ngo about hardening these services.\n\n518\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.310\nMaking sure that when we install new\napplications and they need an encounter\n\n519\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.220\nrun under, they're running with just\nwhat they need and nothing more.\n\n520\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.430\nWhether that's using one\nof the built-in accounts,\n\n521\n00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.100\nbecause it meets my needs and\ndoesn't give ' anything extra.\n\n522\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.930\nOr whether we create our own account.\n\n523\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.970\nAnd that could be a local account, or\nit could be a domain-based account.\n\n524\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:07.079\nIt's all based on what that\napplication needs access to.\n\n525\n00:28:08.243 --> 00:28:12.360\nAnd that, Cherokee,\nI think is probably enough.\n\n526\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.810\nYou heard me talking long enough.\n\n527\n00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.960\nLike I said, they mention IIS, SQL,\nterminal services because these\n\n528\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.785\nare some of the application\nthat are commonly attacked or\n\n529\n00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:24.370\nhave a high-\n&gt;&gt; Vulnerability.\n\n530\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.980\n&gt;&gt; Profile.\n\n531\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n532\n00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.731\n&gt;&gt; I get, I guess there is very lot of\nknown vulnerability is associated with SQL\n\n533\n00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:33.260\nand with IIS, if we live them\nin their default configuration.\n\n534\n00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.440\nSo understanding that I need to go in and\nharden these,\n\n535\n00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.550\nI might wanna change what\naccount they're using.\n\n536\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.480\nTerminal services, same thing,\n\n537\n00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.060\nI really wanna pay attention\nto how I'm configuring those.\n\n538\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.210\nI wanna do my research\nbefore I install them and\n\n539\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.110\nthen I wanna go harden\nthem after the fact.\n\n540\n00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, you've really explained\na lot of the details surrounding\n\n541\n00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.340\nthese accounts.\n\n542\n00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.680\nAnd that's not something that\npeople may think of initially, but\n\n543\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.690\nit is something to consider because it can\naccess different levels of security and\n\n544\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.900\nopen up those vulnerabilities.\n\n545\n00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.600\nSo thank you for sharing that with us.\n\n546\n00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.680\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n547\n00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.010\nWe finally made it to\nthe end of our part three.\n\n548\n00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.440\nBut we do have more GAIC content\nheaded your way, so stay tuned.\n\n549\n00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n550\n00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n551\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.042\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.441\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:16.460\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another GIAC\nsecurity essentials show.\n\n6\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.950\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.901\nIn this particular episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at Linux and\n\n8\n00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:26.030\nthe security features\nthat it has to offer.\n\n9\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.970\nWith us today in studios\nwe have Daniel Lowrie,\n\n10\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.190\nthank you for joining us today Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.878\n&gt;&gt; So glad to be here Cherokee,\nthanks for having me today,\n\n12\n00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:35.030\nlooking forward to diving into some Linux.\n\n13\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.730\nIf you're wondering I thought\nMike was doing this show,\n\n14\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.650\nyou're right, Mike is doing this show.\n\n15\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.260\nBut I have probably just a little more\nexperience with Linux than Mike does.\n\n16\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.320\nSo he asked me to jump in and\nlend that expertise to you guys and girls,\n\n17\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.530\nas it may be, so\nthat you might understand a little better.\n\n18\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.960\nHopefully, I'll do an adequate job for\nMike.\n\n19\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.828\nAnd do him proud, and\nhe'll be happy and say, hey thanks for\n\n20\n00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:57.675\nmaking this show awesome.\n\n21\n00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:59.300\n&gt;&gt; I have faith in you, Daniel.\n\n22\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.280\n&gt;&gt; I think I can do it.\n\n23\n00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.630\nI think I can do it.\n\n24\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.680\nSo let's start this off.\n\n25\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.660\nWhat are we talking about, right?\n\n26\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.000\nWell, if you've been\nwatching since the series,\n\n27\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.840\nwe're basically talking about\ndifferent security ideas and\n\n28\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.550\nhow they make things secure,\nhow to be a secure IT professional.\n\n29\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.357\nWhen we come to Linux,\nLinux is an interesting beast, right?\n\n30\n00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:18.480\nIt's an interesting little monster,\n\n31\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.190\nas I like to call it because\nit is my drug of choice.\n\n32\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.845\nIt's what I use in my daily driver for\nthe most part.\n\n33\n00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:25.243\nI also run Mac OS.\n\n34\n00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:26.750\nI'm running a Mac right here.\n\n35\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.120\nBut underneath the hood is\na variant of the nix variety,\n\n36\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.230\nwe'll get into the differences in\nthose here in just a few minutes.\n\n37\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.984\nBut what we're gonna start\nwith is a Linux overview.\n\n38\n00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:40.789\nLets talk about what Linux is, what\nthe difference is between the different\n\n39\n00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.831\nLinuxes are and some of the things that we\nmight find at any typical Linux system so\n\n40\n00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:48.874\nthat we can use that as our platform for\njumping on, giving you good foundational\n\n41\n00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.906\nknowledge, so that maybe you've\nnever used Linux before or\n\n42\n00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:54.770\nmaybe you have very little\nexperience with Linux.\n\n43\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.410\nMaybe you have a ton of\nLinux experience and\n\n44\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.678\nyou're like, yeah, I know all this stuff.\n\n45\n00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:01.310\nAnd that's very awesome, you can fast\nforward, go to the next video or\n\n46\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.620\ngo to the next portion of videos, whatever\nthe case is as far as the topic of that.\n\n47\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.120\nBut if you're new to Linux or\nif you have very little experience,\n\n48\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.950\nthat's where we're gonna take you today,\nthat's what we're gonna start off with.\n\n49\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.540\nGive you that good foundational knowledge.\n\n50\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.811\n&gt;&gt; I'm just excited even for just\nthe pronunciation of some of these terms,\n\n51\n00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.102\nyou look at some of them, and\nyou're like, I'm not too sure about that.\n\n52\n00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.748\n&gt;&gt; How do you say that?\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of funny strange\n\n53\n00:02:21.748 --> 00:02:24.936\ndifferent words out there when we're\ntalking about these different flavors, so\n\n54\n00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.987\nhopefully you can help us with that today,\nDaniel.\n\n55\n00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:27.847\n&gt;&gt; I will do my best.\n\n56\n00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.374\nAnd what's funny is you bring up\nan actually very interesting topic,\n\n57\n00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:33.980\nis there's always some sort of weird.\n\n58\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.220\nLinux people are strange.\n\n59\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.215\nI'm a strange person.\n\n60\n00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:40.550\n[LAUGHS] I fully acknowledge this,\nand admit to it.\n\n61\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.460\nThat is me, I get that.\n\n62\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.970\nAnd when it comes to pronunciations,\n\n63\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.570\npeople in the Linux community love\nto quibble about that kind of stuff.\n\n64\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.665\nIt's one of their little pastimes,\none of their hobbies.\n\n65\n00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:56.762\n[CROSSTALK] They love to say\nis it Linux or Linux or Linux.\n\n66\n00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:57.710\nIt's all three.\n\n67\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.300\nIt doesn't matter,\nyou just call it toast if you want to.\n\n68\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.270\nAs long as [INAUDIBLE]\nlike you're talking about.\n\n69\n00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.830\nLet's go here.\n\n70\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.180\nLet's start back in the beginning.\n\n71\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.852\nAll right, before.\n\n72\n00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:08.444\n&gt;&gt; Story time.\n\n73\n00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:09.271\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n74\n00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:13.075\nImagine if you will a day before\nthere was modern computing and\n\n75\n00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:15.576\ncomputers existed in just a few places.\n\n76\n00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:20.131\nThey existed in the government and\nthey existed in laboratories and academia.\n\n77\n00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:24.436\nRight, that's basically where computers\nreally got their start in any kind of\n\n78\n00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:25.472\npractical sense.\n\n79\n00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:26.739\nYou sure as heck didn't\nhave them in your house.\n\n80\n00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.479\nThey were just far too large and expensive\nfor you to know anything about that.\n\n81\n00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.980\nAnd have that in your home, unless you're\nsome sort of weird Tony Stark billionaire\n\n82\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.326\nthat had the ability to do that.\n\n83\n00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:36.937\n&gt;&gt; Love Tony Stark.\n\n84\n00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:37.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who doesn't, right?\n\n85\n00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:38.897\nHe's a great guy,he's a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n86\n00:03:38.897 --> 00:03:41.889\n&gt;&gt; And now that we have Jarvis,\nI'm just waiting for the AI of Tony Stark.\n\n87\n00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.259\nLike why did they,\nthey should have just straight to.\n\n88\n00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.369\n&gt;&gt; They like to tease us and\nbuild it up, right?\n\n89\n00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.942\nThat's our movie aside for today.\n\n90\n00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:50.877\nSo that being said,\n\n91\n00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:54.240\nthey had to develop an operating\nsystem to run these computers, right?\n\n92\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.390\nAnd there was a multiple difference\nvariations of operating systems and\n\n93\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.480\ntypically from wherever you're at,\n\n94\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.870\nyou probably had some home grown operating\nsystem that was on your computer.\n\n95\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.580\nBut then they said well that's not great.\n\n96\n00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.200\nWe need to devise something that\nruns on a common structure.\n\n97\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.270\nCommon platform and that runs commonly.\n\n98\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.960\nSo that if Bob-\n&gt;&gt; Uniform.\n\n99\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, uniform, standardization.\n\n100\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.500\nIf Bob is running a program, I can take\nthat program, put it into my computer and\n\n101\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.582\nrun the exact same program.\n\n102\n00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:23.610\nI won't have to rewrite it or\nreinvent the wheel.\n\n103\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.910\nAll right, so they developed Unix.\n\n104\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.370\nAnd this was done by AT&amp;T in Bell Labs.\n\n105\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.940\nBack in the 70s, right?\n\n106\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.640\nThey developed Unix.\n\n107\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.730\nAnd Unix was great, Unix was fantastic.\n\n108\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.680\nIf I'm not mistaken,\n\n109\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.580\nit was basically built upon the C\nprogramming structure and language.\n\n110\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.450\nAnd it did everything very well.\n\n111\n00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.950\nThere was only one problem with it.\n\n112\n00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.770\nIt was extremely expensive.\n\n113\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.580\nAnd even today It's extremely expensive.\n\n114\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.224\nOkay so if you want Bell Labs Unix right,\nthat good old Unix.\n\n115\n00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:59.885\nIt usually tends to run\nyou a bit of money.\n\n116\n00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:04.000\nSo fast forward a little bit and\nthere's this young,\n\n117\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.230\nI believe he's Finnish not that he ended\nsomething but that he's from Finland.\n\n118\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.671\nHis name is Linus Torvalds, all right.\n\n119\n00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.808\nAnd he was taking programming classes and\noperating systems,\n\n120\n00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:17.000\nwas the class he was in.\n\n121\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.920\nAnd he said man it would be nice to have\na unix-like operating system that we\n\n122\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.572\ndidn't have to pay for.\n\n123\n00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:27.890\nIt would make it a whole lot easier for\nus to learn operating systems.\n\n124\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.700\nSo his project was let's do that,\nlet me create.\n\n125\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.990\nAnd he would open it up to\nthe community at large.\n\n126\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.588\nHe would get on bulletin boards.\n\n127\n00:05:35.588 --> 00:05:36.860\n&gt;&gt; A huge gift.\n\n128\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; To the world.\n\n129\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.060\n&gt;&gt; A huge gift to the world.\n\n130\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.980\nThis was in the early 90s,\nI believe it was '91, all right?\n\n131\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.642\nWhat was the first\nstable release of Linux.\n\n132\n00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:50.350\nSo actually it was based off of Minux,\nwhich was based off of Unix.\n\n133\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.880\nBut, we digress.\n\n134\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.750\nAnd what he did was he said hey,\nanybody can make this a little bit better,\n\n135\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.570\nchime in.\n\n136\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.270\nHow about this, I'm gonna openly provide\nyou the code to this operating system.\n\n137\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.380\nAnd anybody that's got some really\ngood ideas, we'd love to hear them.\n\n138\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.855\nAnd we'll make changes accordingly.\n\n139\n00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:10.650\nAnd this starts to get you,\n\n140\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.600\nI kinda want to dip your toe into the open\nsource world, our community at large,\n\n141\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.928\nand understand what happens in there,\nand that's basically what it is.\n\n142\n00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:23.053\nI'm just gonna freely open this up,\nanybody can download this,\n\n143\n00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:28.305\ncost you zero money, right, free 99,\nalways my favorite price for something.\n\n144\n00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.911\nYou can download it,\nlook at the source code, and\n\n145\n00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:35.600\nif you're a programmer maybe you're in\nan operating system class yourself.\n\n146\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.438\nYou're like, you know what, I see what\nthey're doing here, and I actually came up\n\n147\n00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:44.880\nwith a better way that makes this one\nfaster or more efficiently, or whatever,\n\n148\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.027\nit just gives you a better performance,\nthen we should put that in there.\n\n149\n00:06:49.027 --> 00:06:50.567\nSo you write up your changes, and\n\n150\n00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:53.320\nyou submit it and they say,\nthat is a really good idea.\n\n151\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.590\nWe should do that.\n\n152\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.340\nRevise ,and then next version of Linux\ncomes out, and that's what you get.\n\n153\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.050\nYou get the newer, better, stronger,\nfaster Linux than it was previously.\n\n154\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.290\nSo this is open source, this is free.\n\n155\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.570\nThis is the difference between Unix.\n\n156\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.460\nIt's not the big money.\n\n157\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.490\nIt's freely available for anybody to\ndownload and you modify it as you like.\n\n158\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.437\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel, with these iterations, these\nmultiple flavors of Linux, as you will.\n\n159\n00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.468\nDo we still see that unification,\n\n160\n00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:22.839\nthat compatibility like you\nwere talking about before?\n\n161\n00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.761\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cherokee,\nthat's actually a really good question.\n\n162\n00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:26.095\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n163\n00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:29.733\nYou will see a large\nsimilarity between the two,\n\n164\n00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:34.680\nwith Unix and Linux, and\nthe different Linux versions therein.\n\n165\n00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.941\nBasically because they're built\nto be as Unix-like as possible.\n\n166\n00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:42.370\nThat was the whole purpose of it, right?\n\n167\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.150\nSo you do see that.\n\n168\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.924\nYou see standardization across the board\nwhen it comes to file systems.\n\n169\n00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:51.919\nWhen it comes to the way\nscripts are worked with.\n\n170\n00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.570\nThe interface, like the CLI,\nthe command-line interface.\n\n171\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.950\nThe way you can program in it,\nuse editors All that other kind of stuff,\n\n172\n00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.746\nthat all is, if not identical,\nthen very, very similar, so\n\n173\n00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:08.345\nmuch in that if you were to jump from\nUnix to Linux or Linux to Unix, you would\n\n174\n00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:13.181\nfeel extremely comfortable in doing so\nand be able to work pretty well, yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:15.109\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Got it.\n\n176\n00:08:15.109 --> 00:08:15.994\n&gt;&gt; So, pretty simple stuff.\n\n177\n00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:19.326\nAnd that's what we like, so\nif you do come from a Unix background,\n\n178\n00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:22.852\nyou've never touched Linux before,\nyou're gonna be right at home.\n\n179\n00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:25.303\nIt's not gonna be like\nwhat is this new thing,\n\n180\n00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:28.735\nthese new fangled kids with their Linux,\nit's not gonna be like that.\n\n181\n00:08:28.735 --> 00:08:32.859\nAnd if you're like, I'm into Linux,\nman, I got my nose piercing, yeah,\n\n182\n00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.387\nI'm with old man Unix, nah.\n\n183\n00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:36.067\n&gt;&gt; Is that the Linux user?\n\n184\n00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:40.788\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is a lot of Linux users.\n\n185\n00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:44.885\n[LAUGH] I remember I used to\nhave a version of Slackware,\n\n186\n00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:48.902\nwhich is a Linux variant,\na fork, as they call them.\n\n187\n00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:54.012\nAnd the default background picture for\nyour desktop was like\n\n188\n00:08:54.012 --> 00:08:58.730\na baby with a pierced nose and\ntattoos, and he was like.\n\n189\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.596\nYeah, it's funny, so like I said,\nLinux people are weird.\n\n190\n00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:06.566\nI am no exception, I just have a regular\njob, and [LAUGH] I can't have, not that\n\n191\n00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:10.680\nI'm into piercings or tattoos, but\nnot that that's anything wrong with that.\n\n192\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.730\nYou can have that stuff,\nit's just not my deal,\n\n193\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.000\nand which probably makes me\nthe weirdo in the group of weirdos.\n\n194\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.748\n&gt;&gt; Got it, yeah.\n\n195\n00:09:16.748 --> 00:09:17.717\n&gt;&gt; So kinda fun.\n\n196\n00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:18.800\n&gt;&gt; I can relate.\n\n197\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:26.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, moving on to,\nlet's talk a little bit about system v,\n\n198\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.880\nright, or system v init properly, or\nsys v, you might hear it as, or just init.\n\n199\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.936\nOkay, what are you talking about?\n\n200\n00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:37.664\nAll right, this is the way that Linux and\n\n201\n00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:43.160\nUnix handles the starting\nof the operating system.\n\n202\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.730\nAnd I bring this up because here we are\ntoday in 2017, and things are changing.\n\n203\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.860\nSo I wanna make sure that you guys\nhave at least some basic understanding\n\n204\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.460\nof what's going on with these changes.\n\n205\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.170\nAnd if you really wanna get involved and\ngrabbing a bowl of popcorn and\n\n206\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.260\nwatching a flame war go down,\nthis is going to be it.\n\n207\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.507\nWhat I'm talking about is system\nv init versus system d, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.862\nAnd now this is, like I said,\n\n209\n00:10:07.862 --> 00:10:11.260\nit's the way that the operating\nsystem starts things up.\n\n210\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.010\nSo the first thing that happens when you\nboot your computers, you get your BIOS,\n\n211\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.520\nright, and it says I'm looking for\na partition on the hard drive with\n\n212\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.350\ninstructions that say, mount this\npartition and run an operating system, and\n\n213\n00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.920\nhere's the instructions to do that.\n\n214\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.710\nIf it finds that, then do that thing.\n\n215\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.190\nWell, the way that worked\nbefore was system v init,\n\n216\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.110\nwhich is a really simplistic way\nto start the operating system.\n\n217\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.280\nBasically, it just said,\nhere's a folder or directory, and\n\n218\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.690\nit's got a bunch of scripts inside of it,\nand run those scripts.\n\n219\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.320\nAnd there's some ways to set priority for\nwhich script runs first and\n\n220\n00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.970\nyadda yadda, but\nbasically that's what's happening.\n\n221\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.640\nHere's a directory, it's got a bunch of\nscripts inside of it, run those scripts,\n\n222\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.020\nand that's what starts everything inside\nof your Linux operating system or\n\n223\n00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.610\nUnix operating system.\n\n224\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.492\nEverybody was having a grand old time with\nthat, it worked well, it's been around\n\n225\n00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:07.181\nsince the 70s, it's still here,\nit's not gone, you'll still find that.\n\n226\n00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:09.766\nBut system d came along and why, right?\n\n227\n00:11:09.766 --> 00:11:12.230\nWhat is system d, and\nwhy are we even talking about it?\n\n228\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:19.290\nSystem d is more like a program that runs\nwhat we call a daemon properly, right?\n\n229\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.860\nDaemons are services\ninside of your system.\n\n230\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.580\nAnd it tries to do this better,\nand it does, really,\n\n231\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.710\nit does do it better than sys v,\nand it does.\n\n232\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.990\nNot that there's anything wrong with\nsys v init, it's a great structure,\n\n233\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.000\nit works really well, it has worked.\n\n234\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.500\nAnd the war comes into play of well, if it\nain't broke, why are we fixing it, right?\n\n235\n00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.450\nIf it works fine,\nwhy are we changing a very\n\n236\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.310\nfundamental portion of our operating\nsystem to do something different?\n\n237\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.871\nI've gotta learn a new way to do things.\n\n238\n00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.460\nI've gotta learn how to configure\nthis correctly, change stuff.\n\n239\n00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.590\nIt's a whole new thing that I've\nnow gotta reinvent the wheel for\n\n240\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.290\napparently no good reason.\n\n241\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.650\nThere seems to be good\nreasons because just about\n\n242\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.370\nall the large Linux distributors\nare moving towards system d.\n\n243\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.010\nAnd it does seem to be\na better performing system.\n\n244\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.982\nIt removes some of the unnecessary weight\nfor a lot of the systems that get started.\n\n245\n00:12:17.982 --> 00:12:21.933\nNot that your systems are running slowly,\nLinux is known for\n\n246\n00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:24.370\nits speed and performance, right?\n\n247\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.050\nBut again,\nthey're always trying to do better,\n\n248\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.080\nthey're always trying to make that\nhorse run a little bit faster.\n\n249\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.940\nAnd that's the whole purpose of system d.\n\n250\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.467\nA lot of people will tell you that it\nhas needed a revamp for quite some time.\n\n251\n00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:40.167\nAnd there has been other things\nthat have tried to do this, but\n\n252\n00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:45.090\nsystem d seems to have caught the fire,\nand that seems to be which way it's going.\n\n253\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.986\nSo I want you to be prepared that\nif you try to start a service and\n\n254\n00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:51.163\nyou use a command that starts\na service and it doesn't work, well,\n\n255\n00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:53.529\nmaybe that's because\nyou're running system d.\n\n256\n00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:56.644\nAnd if you try to start a service and\nthe service doesn't start or\n\n257\n00:12:56.644 --> 00:13:00.710\nthe command doesn't work, well, it might\nbe because you're running sys v init.\n\n258\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:06.620\nSo you just got to know what system\nyou're running, and that will help you.\n\n259\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.700\nLet me show you one way that's\ntypically the best way to figure out\n\n260\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.160\nwhat you're running, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.213\nI'm gonna jump over my Linux machine,\nhere it is right here.\n\n262\n00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.510\nThis is actually a penetration\ntesting version.\n\n263\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.480\n&gt;&gt; No tattooed babies?\n\n264\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.770\n&gt;&gt; No tattooed babies unfortunately,\nI'll have to work on that.\n\n265\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.557\nI'll make sure it's for\nthe next show, just kidding, [LAUGH].\n\n266\n00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:31.438\nAnd I've got the Terminal open, which is\nreally easy, I just clicked on Terminal,\n\n267\n00:13:31.438 --> 00:13:32.757\nor I just right click.\n\n268\n00:13:32.757 --> 00:13:36.401\nEach Linux tends to be a little bit\ndifferent from distro to distro, but\n\n269\n00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:38.668\nwe'll cross that bridge when we get there.\n\n270\n00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:42.850\nI just wanna show you how you can tell\nwhat version of Linux you're running.\n\n271\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.384\nIs it sys v init or system d, all right?\n\n272\n00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:50.117\nSo what we do is use this,\nI'm logged in as an administrator, so\n\n273\n00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:55.039\nI don't have to do the sudo command or\nsudo, whatever you like it.\n\n274\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.500\nBut what you need to do is do ps -p 1,\nright?\n\n275\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.760\nps is the processes that are running, and\np says give me process, and then number 1.\n\n276\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.414\nI want the first process, which should be,\nright, the script that says run all these\n\n277\n00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:14.633\nscripts inside of the system because\nthat's how the operating system runs.\n\n278\n00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:18.050\nIf the operating system isn't running, or\nif you're looking at a kernel panic or\n\n279\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.022\nsomething like that, that's because\nthat didn't run correctly, or\n\n280\n00:14:21.022 --> 00:14:22.980\nsomething tried to run before it,\nall right?\n\n281\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.855\nSo that can happen, but typically,\n\n282\n00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:27.524\nthis should be the very\nfirst process that gets run.\n\n283\n00:14:27.524 --> 00:14:28.917\n&gt;&gt; So by using this parameter,\n\n284\n00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.358\nwe're essentially calling in that\nservice to see what it's titled?\n\n285\n00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:36.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I wanna see what is the very\nfirst process that is running\n\n286\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.370\non my running Linux system.\n\n287\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.213\nRight, there should be system v in it,\nor it should be system d.\n\n288\n00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:45.258\nSo I hit Return, and look, right there,\n\n289\n00:14:45.258 --> 00:14:48.920\nI see that system d is what\nthis system is running.\n\n290\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.500\nSo a very good way in which for you to\nfigure out what it is you're running.\n\n291\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.410\nAnd it might say sys v,\nor it might say system d.\n\n292\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.792\nIt also might say upstart,\n\n293\n00:14:57.792 --> 00:15:01.758\nupstart is another one of those guys that\ntried to throw their hat in the ring and\n\n294\n00:15:01.758 --> 00:15:04.980\nsay hey, we know that sys v-\n&gt;&gt; Just didn't gain a lot of traction?\n\n295\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.800\n&gt;&gt; It did actually for a little while,\nwhich is why you might actually see it.\n\n296\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.120\nUpstart was popular, it's very similar\nto system v in the way that it works and\n\n297\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.330\nthe way that it operates,\nwhich is why it got so much popularity.\n\n298\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.530\nBut system d is winning the fight.\n\n299\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.275\nAnd as you can see,\nthis is a fresh installation.\n\n300\n00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:26.294\nAnd system d won this over.\n\n301\n00:15:26.294 --> 00:15:27.329\nSo that's probably what\nyou see [CROSSTALK]\n\n302\n00:15:27.329 --> 00:15:28.173\n&gt;&gt; And what flavor or\n\n303\n00:15:28.173 --> 00:15:31.500\nvariation distribution,\nis the proper term, are you running here?\n\n304\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n305\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.350\nLet's move into that.\n\n306\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.730\nWe can close this down.\n\n307\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.090\nI just wanted you guys to see that.\n\n308\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.790\nActually, I'll just clear the screen.\n\n309\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.240\nWe don't need that anymore.\n\n310\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.630\nSo let's talk about distribution.\n\n311\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.360\nDistributions, or distros,\n\n312\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.790\nthat's how I typically would say that,\nlet's talk about distros.\n\n313\n00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.617\nThere are many of them.\n\n314\n00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:55.944\nThere are so, so very many of them that\nit can feel a little overwhelming.\n\n315\n00:15:55.944 --> 00:16:01.019\nBut the good news is that you\ncan basically break it down to\n\n316\n00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:06.643\njust a few main forks,\nas they call them from the Linux kernel.\n\n317\n00:16:06.643 --> 00:16:09.308\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel,\nI like to think of it as a family and\n\n318\n00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:11.466\ntheir all kind of related in some way.\n\n319\n00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:13.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good way.\n\n320\n00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:15.448\nThink of it as a family tree,\nalmost, right?\n\n321\n00:16:15.448 --> 00:16:17.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you,\n\n322\n00:16:17.054 --> 00:16:20.612\nyou can go out to the Google search,\nLinux forks, and\n\n323\n00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:26.530\ntypically they will have a tree structure\nthat shows where each fork came from.\n\n324\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.130\nAnd main forks have there\nown like trunk of the tree,\n\n325\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.800\nand everything that came off of them\nare branches that go off of that.\n\n326\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.799\nAnd there are very few main forks.\n\n327\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:41.610\nTypically though, you'll be working with\none of two types of Linux distributions.\n\n328\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.230\nOne will be the Red Hat variety, right?\n\n329\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.620\nThis is things like CentOS,\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, right?\n\n330\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.255\nThe actual Red Hat\nbranded version of Linux.\n\n331\n00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:58.469\nAnd there's also Fedora,\nIf you're not aware, a fedora is a hat.\n\n332\n00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:00.199\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel,\n\n333\n00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:02.421\nthat's your style sense\ncoming out right here.\n\n334\n00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n335\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.720\nI thought it was actually pretty funny and\nclever by then to go okay.\n\n336\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.390\nThis is not gonna be red hats,\nbut we want it to be Red Hat.\n\n337\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.410\nSo, what do we do?\n\n338\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.250\nThey should have called it-\n&gt;&gt; Beret.\n\n339\n00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or, what's another word for\nred, like another type of red?\n\n340\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:18.840\n&gt;&gt; Crimson?\n\n341\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.830\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n342\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.950\nCrimson fedora, right?\n\n343\n00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.330\nIt's basically Red Hat, right?\n\n344\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:29.720\nSo, anyway, it's Fedora, and\nthese are the Red Hat major variants.\n\n345\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.120\nAll right, that you'll see.\n\n346\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.245\nRed Hat is supported\nthe Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n347\n00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.032\nit's supported by Red Hat Incorporated.\n\n348\n00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:38.752\nThey are a company, they are entity,\nthey are for profit, they make money.\n\n349\n00:17:38.752 --> 00:17:41.065\nAnd you might be saying, how is that, but\n\n350\n00:17:41.065 --> 00:17:44.130\nyou said that Linux was\nfreely distributed?\n\n351\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.890\nAnd it is, and it has to be by law.\n\n352\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.070\nAnd they can't do that, but what they\ndo is they, you end up paying for\n\n353\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.270\ntheir service, right, so if you need\ntech support, or something like that,\n\n354\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.250\nyou get that with them when you\npurchase a server license from Red Hat.\n\n355\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.420\nSo you can call them and\nsay I need help, something is wrong.\n\n356\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd they will actually help you, so that\nis nice, you're paying for that service,\n\n357\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.820\nso that's a good way.\n\n358\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.300\nThe packaging, the distribution media,\n\n359\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.390\nthat kind of stuff,\nthat's what you end you paying for.\n\n360\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.200\nAnd you still can download\nthe source code for\n\n361\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.560\nRed Hat Linux for free from Red Hat.\n\n362\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.500\nYou just won't get all\nthe added-on features.\n\n363\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.120\nThey won't include that stuff, they'll\njust give you the kernel of Red Hat,\n\n364\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.760\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n365\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.740\nIt's something to that effect,\nwhere that's not testable.\n\n366\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.087\nWe're not gonna ask you\nabout that on the GIAC but\n\n367\n00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:35.810\n[COUGH] that's basically what's happening.\n\n368\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.448\nThat's how they get away with [LAUGH] for\ncharging you money for\n\n369\n00:18:38.448 --> 00:18:40.028\nsomething that's typically free.\n\n370\n00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:44.942\nBut if you want all the good bells and\nwhistles that is maintained\n\n371\n00:18:44.942 --> 00:18:49.674\nby the community, or\nactually a Red Hat specific community,\n\n372\n00:18:49.674 --> 00:18:53.409\nthat's where Cent OS or\nCentOS comes into play.\n\n373\n00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:57.062\nCentOS, and for most intents and purposes,\n\n374\n00:18:57.062 --> 00:19:00.630\nis Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nin a lot of ways.\n\n375\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.280\nThey try to be that as much as they can,\nright?\n\n376\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.260\nYou don't obviously get some sort\nof phone call, tech support.\n\n377\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.590\nI can't email someone and\nsay hey, can you fix this for me?\n\n378\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.920\nOpen up a ticket,\nI need some help with that.\n\n379\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.105\nYou're not gonna get that,\nyou'll get community support.\n\n380\n00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:21.650\nAnd you can go to a forum, read other\nforum posts, post your own kind of stuff.\n\n381\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.585\nThat's, that's the good\nwe're gonna see with that.\n\n382\n00:19:23.585 --> 00:19:27.240\nCentOS is a very stable, very good\n\n383\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.190\nfree version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nbasically, is what it boils down to, so.\n\n384\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.700\nThen there's Fedora, right,\nso, why the multi variations?\n\n385\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.970\nWell, obviously we've got Red Hat,\nwhich is paid,\n\n386\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.860\nthen you have CentOS which is free, but\n\n387\n00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:51.430\nthose are basically server based operating\nsystems, and Red Hat likes to be\n\n388\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.690\nsolid, likes to be stable, and you're\nthinking, well, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n389\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't everyone?\n\n390\n00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wouldn't everyone?\n\n391\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.410\nAnd yes, if you're talking about server\nbased operating systems that I'm gonna put\n\n392\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.770\nin my production rack, I want that bad boy\nto be as rock solid as humanly possible.\n\n393\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.010\nThe problem is, not problem,\n\n394\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.540\nthe issue is Is that you don't\nget the bleeding it's technology.\n\n395\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.380\nYou might not get support for something\nthat you need support for, because it's so\n\n396\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.830\nnew, they don't have support for it yet.\n\n397\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.822\nSo, if they don't have rock solid support\nfor something, they don't include it.\n\n398\n00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:27.036\nYou have to put that, and then if you\nadd it to it, they'll support it, right?\n\n399\n00:20:27.036 --> 00:20:30.926\nBecause it's not part of their\nofficial distribution system, so\n\n400\n00:20:30.926 --> 00:20:33.940\nyou have to be aware of\nthat kind of thing happen.\n\n401\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.960\nAnd that's what Red Hat, or not Red Hat,\nI'm sorry, Fedora comes into play.\n\n402\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.000\nFedora is their bleeding edge, every\nnew technology, they can slap into it.\n\n403\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.790\nI like the way Don put this, he said, if\nyou want to see where Red Hat's gonna be.\n\n404\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.580\nAnd in the future, download Fedora,\nand that's what it'll be.\n\n405\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.320\nIt might not be the most stable thing\nin the world, things might crash,\n\n406\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.850\nservices might not work correctly,\nand that's not because it's bad.\n\n407\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.410\nIt's just because it's so new.\n\n408\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.030\nYour particular chip on your motherboard,\nor\n\n409\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.360\nwhatever, just might not be supported\nquiet yet, so be aware of that.\n\n410\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.830\nBut if you want the bleeding edge\ntechnology, Fedora is the way to go.\n\n411\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.600\nSo now, let's jump into these second\nmajor variant that you're gonna see.\n\n412\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.660\nThat is a Debian or Debian,\na lot of people say Debian.\n\n413\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.507\nDon looked this up, it is Debian, Debian.\n\n414\n00:21:22.507 --> 00:21:23.111\n&gt;&gt; Debian.\n\n415\n00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:29.090\n&gt;&gt; From a couple, I think they're man and\nwife, is Debbie and Ian.\n\n416\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.150\nThey're Deb Ian.\n\n417\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.133\n&gt;&gt; Cute.\n&gt;&gt; So, Debian.\n\n418\n00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:32.173\n&gt;&gt; How romantic.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very.\n\n419\n00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:33.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very, very romantic.\n\n420\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.878\nGood for them.\n\n421\n00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:38.120\nThis is the other major version\nof Linux that you'll run into.\n\n422\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.088\nThey have forked off into\nthings like Ubuntu, Linux Mint.\n\n423\n00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:50.623\nBasically, this is to the big dogs on\nthe block that you find in Ubuntu.\n\n424\n00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:54.940\nMy Collie Linux that I'm running\nright here is, a Debian variant.\n\n425\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.130\nIt's actually an Ubuntu variant.\n\n426\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.970\nUbuntu is like Fedora for Red Hat, right?\n\n427\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.370\nUbuntu, we're putting everything\nwe can in the kitchen sink at it.\n\n428\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.160\nWe're giving you support for every latest\nand greatest bleeding edge technologies\n\n429\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.160\nthat are coming out,\ntrying to make that work, hopefully.\n\n430\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.745\nYou can download, install, and\neverything will work perfectly for you.\n\n431\n00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:18.270\nUbuntu seems to be a very popular,\nit's extremely easy to work with.\n\n432\n00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.890\nIt's very user friendly, I like it a lot.\n\n433\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.870\nCollie is a fork of Ubuntu,\nhence why I like it so much.\n\n434\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.989\nIt's very nice, also use Linux Mint\nquite a bit, it's very nice.\n\n435\n00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:33.560\nBut these are more not that you\ncan't run server services in it, but\n\n436\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.038\nthey're more for the desk top user.\n\n437\n00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:39.802\nDebian does have, if you just download\nDebian Linux, that's really great for\n\n438\n00:22:39.802 --> 00:22:41.080\nservers.\n\n439\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.876\nFantastic, you gotta remember on servers,\nyou're not typically installing more\n\n440\n00:22:45.876 --> 00:22:49.523\nbloated where things that a user\nwould be using at home, right,\n\n441\n00:22:49.523 --> 00:22:52.969\nyou're installing network services and\nserver services,\n\n442\n00:22:52.969 --> 00:22:57.764\nthat's what you want to do, you don't care\nabout running Candy Crush or whatever,\n\n443\n00:22:57.764 --> 00:22:59.744\nsome video game\n&gt;&gt; An email client or something.\n\n444\n00:22:59.744 --> 00:23:03.484\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, watching YouTube videos on your\nserver is just not what you're gonna do,\n\n445\n00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:07.550\nso you don't install Flash and\nthings of that nature that will bloat it.\n\n446\n00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.988\nBut in, if you're running\na desktop operating system,\n\n447\n00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:14.670\nI've run CentOS as a desktop\noperating system, you can do that,\n\n448\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.210\nbut an Ubuntu variant, in my opinion,\nis an easier way to go, especially if\n\n449\n00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.170\nyou're on you haven't ever worked with\nLinux before, this is new to you.\n\n450\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.157\nI would suggest going with Ubuntu or\nsomething, or Mint.\n\n451\n00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.075\n&gt;&gt; As a segueway.\n\n452\n00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, it's a whole lot easier.\n\n453\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.380\nAll right, well,\nhow much time have we got?\n\n454\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.320\nWe have very little time,\n\n455\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.863\nso I would say let's-\n&gt;&gt; Let's cover the last two forks that\n\n456\n00:23:38.863 --> 00:23:39.806\nyou were speaking of.\n\n457\n00:23:39.806 --> 00:23:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much-\n&gt;&gt; How about that-\n\n458\n00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.672\n&gt;&gt; For reminding me of that.\n\n459\n00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:49.675\nWe do have, actually, we do have one\nfork left, and that is BSD, BSD.\n\n460\n00:23:49.675 --> 00:23:50.324\n&gt;&gt; Excuse you?\n\n461\n00:23:50.324 --> 00:23:52.047\n&gt;&gt; Yes, BSD yes, is.\n\n462\n00:23:52.047 --> 00:23:54.684\n[LAUGH] BSD, right.\n\n463\n00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:58.952\nBSD is Berkley Software Distribution.\n\n464\n00:23:58.952 --> 00:24:04.190\nSo, this is an actual Unix fork.\n\n465\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.530\nThis isn't a Linux version.\n\n466\n00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.540\nThis is Unix, but\nit's something you might actually see.\n\n467\n00:24:09.945 --> 00:24:13.590\nBSD's is highly popular when\nit comes to running server.\n\n468\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.710\nIt's very secure.\n\n469\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.040\nIt's very stable.\n\n470\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.060\nPeople like it a lot, especially if you're\nold Unix guys, BSD is your cup of tea.\n\n471\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.085\nThere's a lot of different\nversions of BSD, there's FreeBSD.\n\n472\n00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.268\nYou might be familiar with it if\nyou've ever worked with Mac OS.\n\n473\n00:24:29.268 --> 00:24:33.120\nMac OS runs a derivation of FreeBSD, or\n\n474\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.319\npart of it is in,\nit makes up the Darwin OS,\n\n475\n00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:43.650\nwhich is under the hood if you're\nrunning a Mac computer stuff.\n\n476\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.670\nIf you got a Macbook, Pro,\nor Air, whatever you have.\n\n477\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:53.160\nWhen you go to the spotlight, the little\nmagnifying glass on top right corner.\n\n478\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.769\nYou hit that, you type in terminal,\nyou hit Enter and that black box pops up,\n\n479\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.810\nIn there is the BSD or the Darwin.\n\n480\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.480\nDarwin is running under that.\n\n481\n00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.420\nAnd it's based off of BSD.\n\n482\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.460\nSo if you have that,\n\n483\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.850\nyou might actually have some more\nexperience than you're familiar with.\n\n484\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.360\nIf you didn't that that's what was running\nunderneath the hood on your Macintosh, or\n\n485\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.090\nApple hardware.\n\n486\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.512\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel, going back to that\nquestion that I asked before about\n\n487\n00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:26.547\nthe compatibility, because these\noperating systems are somewhat related,\n\n488\n00:25:26.547 --> 00:25:28.396\nwell they are a little family here.\n\n489\n00:25:28.396 --> 00:25:33.353\nWould some commands be applicable, or\ncompatible within the different flavors,\n\n490\n00:25:33.353 --> 00:25:36.930\nsuch as going from BSD,\nand Linux, and vice versa?\n\n491\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that usually comes from\nthe fact that BSD is the operating system,\n\n492\n00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:45.750\nLinux is the operating system,\nit is the kernel that runs the hardware.\n\n493\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:50.520\nIt says user input information to me and\nI'll translate that\n\n494\n00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.370\nto the metal underneath the hood\nof this machine, right?\n\n495\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.560\nThat's basically what's going on.\n\n496\n00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.200\nAnd then you bolt things onto that.\n\n497\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.340\nSo when you open a command line,\n\n498\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.710\nit's typically some sort of Posix\ncompliant command line interpreter.\n\n499\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.820\nTypically running bash or\nthe born again shell.\n\n500\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.290\nThat's the interpreter.\n\n501\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.138\nSo when you type in a command,\nif I'm running Bash on my Kali Linux.\n\n502\n00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:15.359\n&gt;&gt; So if Mac OS X was the same terminal,\n\n503\n00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:18.700\nthen some of those commands\nmay be integrated there.\n\n504\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.620\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n505\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.970\nAs long as the programs that\nyou wanna run are installed and\n\n506\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:30.730\nthey are compliant with Unix or\nLinux Then yeah, and typically they are.\n\n507\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.040\nWhenever somebody creates a program,\ntypically again, for\n\n508\n00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.550\nLinux, it works with Unix.\n\n509\n00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.020\nAgain, because it's running in\nthe bash interpreter, right,\n\n510\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.520\nwhich is running on top of Linux or Unix.\n\n511\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.600\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n512\n00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.350\nLet's jump on my computer, this will be\nthe last thing we do for this episode,\n\n513\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.360\nwe're running out of time.\n\n514\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.550\nBut let's do that ps -p1,\nwe got that, right?\n\n515\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.480\nWe see we're on system D.\n\n516\n00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.030\nIf I run back over to my Mac OS, let's\nsee what happens when I do that here.\n\n517\n00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.444\nI have not tested this, so\nthis'll be interesting.\n\n518\n00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:03.220\n-p 1, I'll be interested\nin what's going on here.\n\n519\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.530\nSo look at this, we get launch d.\n\n520\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.220\nSo it's a different thing, even though,\nbut I ran the same command, right?\n\n521\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.150\nThe exact same command,\ngot a little different output,\n\n522\n00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.170\nbecause the systems are different.\n\n523\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.660\nBut the commands ran on both of them,\n\n524\n00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.230\nbecause these are both BASH environments,\nso born again shell.\n\n525\n00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:25.170\nAnd we'll get into that a little bit\nmore as we progress through the series,\n\n526\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.070\nespecially here, inside of Linux.\n\n527\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.190\nBut basically yes, that is hopefully as\nwe're starting to get a good idea of what\n\n528\n00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:35.880\nthe differences between the different\nvarieties of Linux and Unix are.\n\n529\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.910\nAnd how they're extremely similar,\ntake that away from here.\n\n530\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.200\nAnd that as we learn\nstuff about one system,\n\n531\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.020\nwe're basically learning about them all.\n\n532\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:49.270\nBut I will be showing you where they\ndo differ a little bit as we progress.\n\n533\n00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.520\nSo that you go, well,\nI'm in a Red Hat variant, so\n\n534\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.220\nI need to do this instead of that.\n\n535\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.440\nCuz that can trip you\nup from time to time.\n\n536\n00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.190\nThere are some differences and\nwe'll cover those.\n\n537\n00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.890\nBut as for this, right now,\n\n538\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:07.230\njust about 95% of everything else is going\nto be very, very similar if not identical.\n\n539\n00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Daniel, for\nsharing story time with us today.\n\n540\n00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.620\nI'm actually looking forward to\ngetting some more history out of you.\n\n541\n00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.090\nAnd I'm sure you guys are as well.\n\n542\n00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.520\nSo stay tuned.\n\n543\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.620\nGet comfortable.\n\n544\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.720\nI think we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this particular episode.\n\n545\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.590\nAnd I'll sign off as your show host.\n\n546\n00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.700\nI'm Cherokee Boost.\n\n547\n00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.520\nAnd I'm Daniel Lowery.\n\n548\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.986\nSee you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n549\n00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:33.839\n[MUSIC]\n\n550\n00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:36.998\nThank you for watching

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:05.652\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:08.199\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.730\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.553\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\n\n8\n00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:23.430\ntoday we're doing our GIAC GSEC or\nGIAC Security Essentials.\n\n9\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.050\nGSEC for short and\nwe're going to be going into Linux.\n\n10\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.635\nActually, this is a part two,\nright, Daniel?\n\n11\n00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:29.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be doing\n\n12\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.010\na part two on our Linux overview.\n\n13\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.210\nAnd here to help us with that of course is\nMr Daniel, hi, how are you doing Daniel?\n\n14\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.368\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I'm doing fantastic, I'm glad\nto be back in the studio going over some\n\n15\n00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:43.342\nmore, Linux and specific with GIAC\nsecurity essentials portion of that.\n\n16\n00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:47.456\nWe wanna make sure you guys know what you\nneed to know since you have some Linux\n\n17\n00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.690\nfoundation knowledge and\nsome Linux security knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.225\nThat's our goal in this little\nminiseries inside of a series, I guess.\n\n19\n00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:55.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can say.\n\n20\n00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:01.580\nAnd we talked about different types of\nflavors of Linux in the previous episode.\n\n21\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.360\nSo we really just did fare tell in\nthe water, what is Linux, what can I\n\n22\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.000\nexpect from one Linux to the other, how\ndo I know what type of Linux I'm running.\n\n23\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.216\nThat's the kind of things that we\ntalked about in the previous episode.\n\n24\n00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.710\nNow we're gonna get into some\nmore practical stuff, right.\n\n25\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.180\nThings that you, an everyday\nperson that would be running or\n\n26\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.910\nusing a Linux distribution would\nneed to know just in general, right.\n\n27\n00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.590\nAnd a great place to start\nwith that is networking.\n\n28\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.210\nRight, we love to network.\n\n29\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I want my computer to be able to get\n\n30\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.410\non the Internet.\n\n31\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.850\nIt's a fantastic thing.\n\n32\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.941\nI know, Mike,\nyou enjoy that privilege, right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.562\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do and if we've got a machine,\n\n34\n00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:35.190\nwhether it's running Linux or Windows.\n\n35\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.040\nI mean it really doesn't do me\na lot of good if it's isolated from\n\n36\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.590\neverything else.\n\n37\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.380\nSo we take this Linux box,\nwe plug it into the network, but\n\n38\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.270\nsomehow we've gotta get that TCP/IP\nconfiguration configured on that machine.\n\n39\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.020\nAnd you're gonna show us how to do that,\nright?\n\n40\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.810\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n41\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.950\nNail on the head right there.\n\n42\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.530\nGive Mike the gold star,\nbecause that's exactly right.\n\n43\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.010\nI want to be able to plug in a wire or\n\n44\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.970\nturn on a Wi-Fi device and\nhey, there is some networking.\n\n45\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.440\nAnd typically that's what happens.\n\n46\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.800\nTypically you turn on any everyday\ncomputer and whether it is running Linux\n\n47\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.700\nor whether it is running Windows or\nany other operating system.\n\n48\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.790\nThey are usually configured to\ngain all that TCP/IP information\n\n49\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.240\nby itself and configure itself.\n\n50\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.990\nAnd then connect you to whatever network\nit is that it's trying to connect to.\n\n51\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.090\nAnd then if that network is connected\nto the internet, all the better.\n\n52\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.970\nBecause you have access to the wondrous\nInternet that we all know and love.\n\n53\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.740\nThat being said,\n\n54\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.050\nwe do need to know some things cuz not\neverything always works as planned.\n\n55\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.420\nSometimes things go awry.\n\n56\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.980\nSo we got to know what to do.\n\n57\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.940\nWhat are the tools built into Linux, so\nthat we can overcome those obstacles.\n\n58\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.790\nOr if we just need information, right,\n\n59\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.390\nout of our computer about\nits network settings.\n\n60\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.130\nHow do we get that?\n\n61\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.820\nHow do we work with that?\n\n62\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.510\nHow do we start setting configurations\nourselves if we need to do that.\n\n63\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.309\nSo that's what we're gonna tackle today.\n\n64\n00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:54.829\nAnd let's start of with basically two of\nmaybe the three commands that you're gonna\n\n65\n00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.830\nneed to lock down, put it in your mind,\nso that you know them stone cold, right?\n\n66\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.320\nThe first two are gonna be ifconfig and\nIP, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.540\nSeems pretty simple, right?\n\n68\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.632\nIfconfig probably sounds,\nif you come from a Windows background,\n\n69\n00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:16.520\nsounds very similar to ipconfig and\nthat's because they are kind of similar.\n\n70\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.140\nThey are not identical in the way that\nthey work, at all as a matter of fact.\n\n71\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.550\nIpconfig is a completely different animal,\n\n72\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.950\nother then some of the information that\nyou can clean from it than ifconfig.\n\n73\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.820\nIfconfig works in its own little way and\nit's the most tried and true.\n\n74\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.670\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n75\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.810\nIf you've had any previous\nLinux experience and\n\n76\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.790\nyou've dealt with networking\ninside of that Linux environment.\n\n77\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.070\nThen it's a good chance that you\nhave probably issued the ifconfig\n\n78\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.060\ncommand before.\n\n79\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.430\nBut if you haven't, don't worry.\n\n80\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.690\nThat's what we're here for.\n\n81\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.680\nYou can open up your terminal,\ntype in ifcon I have an idea.\n\n82\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.860\nLet's do that very thing, right?\n\n83\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.685\n&gt;&gt; Do you have a Linux\nbox with a terminal?\n\n84\n00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:55.737\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, I do.\n\n85\n00:03:55.737 --> 00:03:57.100\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; It's sitting right here.\n\n86\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.470\nLet's go to that Linux box and\nthere she is.\n\n87\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.435\nSo beautiful with my\nlovely green background.\n\n88\n00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:03.585\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Making the beautiful contrast.\n\n89\n00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:05.895\nBlack on green on red.\n\n90\n00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:09.258\nYou'll notice I log in as root on this\nmachine and that's typically a no-no.\n\n91\n00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:12.805\nWe're talking security here,\nthat's typically a no-no.\n\n92\n00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:15.355\nI don't wanna fight with\npseudo commands and\n\n93\n00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:19.185\nforgetting to do that while I'm\ndemonstrating things for you guys.\n\n94\n00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:24.290\nSo if you're not logged in as root, that's\ncorrect, do that, don't log in as root.\n\n95\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.912\nElevate your commands using sudo,\nit should look like this s-u-d-o,\n\n96\n00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:33.660\nsuch as that, that will give you\nthe administrator privileges you need to\n\n97\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.750\nrun certain commands.\n\n98\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.022\nYou don't need it all the time and\n\n99\n00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:38.903\nit can be a little confusing especially\nwhen you try to demonstrate stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:44.910\nSo I've eliminated that as a problem for\nus for demonstration purposes only.\n\n101\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.460\nLog in as a normal user that\nhas administrative rights,\n\n102\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.560\nthey're part of the sudoers or\nthe wheel group.\n\n103\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.990\nAnd then you'll be able to\nissue sudo to a command and\n\n104\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.842\nit will elevate your privileges.\n\n105\n00:04:54.842 --> 00:04:58.803\nAll right, that been said,\nifconfig is where we're at today, so\n\n106\n00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:01.225\nlet's type that in ifconfig, like so.\n\n107\n00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:05.415\nNow you'll notice that when I type in\nifconfig I get some information back and\n\n108\n00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:09.370\nthat's typically what we're\ndoing when it comes to this.\n\n109\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.240\nOne of the most important lines in\nthis jumbled mess of info that you're\n\n110\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.460\nhaving to wade through.\n\n111\n00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.190\nIs this one right here where it\nsays inet and it has of course,\n\n112\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.600\nthis dotted decimal\nstring of numbers here.\n\n113\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.250\nAnd if you're familiar with networking,\nwhich I hope you have some networking\n\n114\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.340\nexperience, you know that is\nthe IP address for this adapter.\n\n115\n00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.270\nYou notice I have another adapter here,\nthe loopback adapter and\n\n116\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.030\nit also has a inet address.\n\n117\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.650\nAnd again,\nif you're familiar with networking,\n\n118\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.290\nyou should know that that\nis the home address, right?\n\n119\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.410\nThe loopback adapter,\nall that other good stuff you need to test\n\n120\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.940\nnetworking you can use that,\nit's built in there as well.\n\n121\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.960\nBut it separates them.\n\n122\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.200\nIt sees this is basically what\nyou call a virtual adapter and\n\n123\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.260\nthis is an actual, I'm lying to you again\n[LAUGH], this is a virtual machine.\n\n124\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.150\nSo this is technically a virtual adapter,\nbut as far as Linux is concerned, as far\n\n125\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.620\nas we're concerned for our demonstrations,\nthis is a physical adapter.\n\n126\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.880\nAnd that's what we have.\n\n127\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.030\nSo inets right there that\ngives me my IP address.\n\n128\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.010\nSo if I was a tech support person or\nif I needed to know what's\n\n129\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.350\nyour IP address, I can type an ikp config,\nlook for that inet and I would see that.\n\n130\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.220\nNow if you have a bunch, you notice\nthat it gave me all of the adapters.\n\n131\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.500\nIf I just said ifconfig,\ngive me every adapter under the sun.\n\n132\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.830\nI only have two, that's a good thing.\n\n133\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.720\nLet me jump over to my Mac OS system,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.500\n&gt;&gt; And let's see what happens\nwhen I throw ifconfig at that.\n\n135\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.020\nSo here we are, we got the terminal open,\n\n136\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.000\nI do ifconfig and wow,\n&gt;&gt; That's ugly.\n\n137\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gets pretty crazy.\n\n138\n00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.160\nLook at all the adapters\nthat I have in here.\n\n139\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.625\nAnd that is because I'm\nrunning virtual networks.\n\n140\n00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.660\nI've got multiple machines running.\n\n141\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.348\nI've got a wired like\na thunderbolt ethernet adapter,\n\n142\n00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:58.100\nI've got my Wi-Fi adapter.\n\n143\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.120\nI've got VPN adapter,\nit's all going to show up.\n\n144\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.200\nSo this can get a little bit\nstrenuous to look through.\n\n145\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.430\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n146\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.246\nthat ifconfig just issuing that\ncan be a bit of a torrent.\n\n147\n00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:15.400\n&gt;&gt; So ifconfig then really\nsays I'm gonna give you all\n\n148\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.630\nof your TCP/IP config information for\nevery network there that I could find.\n\n149\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.190\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n150\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.830\nIt does not discriminate because\nyou didn't discriminate.\n\n151\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.770\nIf I did ifconfig, I don't know\nthat I have an ethoh adaptor here,\n\n152\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.010\nlet me look, I don't.\n\n153\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.166\nBut let's say eno, right, so I have eno.\n\n154\n00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:36.160\nIf I did eno,\nit would just give me eno's information.\n\n155\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.790\nSo if you know what adapter\nit is you wanna see,\n\n156\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.650\nyou can just add that as an option and\nthen it will only return that information.\n\n157\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.810\nAnd we'll do that a lot especially if I'm\ntrying to I don't know, set an IP address,\n\n158\n00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.380\nI don't wanna set the IP\naddress on every one of them.\n\n159\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.250\nWhich it won't do, right?\n\n160\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.270\nBut it will bark at you and say well\n,what adapter do you want this on?\n\n161\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.252\n&gt;&gt; You gotta decide which one, yeah.\n\n162\n00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:57.976\n&gt;&gt; You can't just do this\non everything [LAUGH].\n\n163\n00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We need a specific one here.\n\n164\n00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:01.093\nSo we're gonna be doing that a lot,\n\n165\n00:08:01.093 --> 00:08:03.759\nspecifying what adapter\nit is that we're using.\n\n166\n00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.660\nSo let's jump back over to Linux here.\n\n167\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.551\nAnd I told you the other command was IP.\n\n168\n00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:14.336\nSo, with IP, specifically,\nI need to add some commands to that, or\n\n169\n00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:17.595\nsome options to that, some extra bits.\n\n170\n00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:23.320\nIP addr is gonna kinda give us\nthe same output that we got with\n\n171\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.830\nifconfig, so\nif I do IP space addr, like that.\n\n172\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.800\nHit Enter.\n\n173\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.590\nYou'll notice I get\nthe same kind of output.\n\n174\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.852\nIt's in a little reverse order here.\n\n175\n00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:34.596\nWe have [INAUDIBLE].\n\n176\n00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:39.580\nLet me move this over, and make\nthe output look a little bit prettier.\n\n177\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.710\nThere we go.\n\n178\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.948\nSo you'll see, there's the adapter.\n\n179\n00:08:42.948 --> 00:08:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There's the etho adapter.\n\n180\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.507\nAnd then there is INET, and I have my\nIP address, it also gives me things\n\n181\n00:08:50.507 --> 00:08:55.444\nsubnet mask, right, you'll see\nthat this is that CIDR notation.\n\n182\n00:08:55.444 --> 00:09:00.190\nWhen we did ifconfig, we also got\nthat information there is the net\n\n183\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.670\nmask right there,\ngiving it in the normal net mask notation.\n\n184\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.850\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a giveaway that IP is later\nthan ifconfig, ifconfig still does\n\n185\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:15.900\nit the old way of denoting subnet mask,\nIP, however, uses that new cyber notation.\n\n186\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Mike, that's actually a really\ngood point, I didn't never think of that,\n\n187\n00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:23.686\nand this is smart, maybe because\nCIDR's more of a new thing, and\n\n188\n00:09:23.686 --> 00:09:27.990\nus old timers still stick with that old\nblock-type, the IP blocks, but good point.\n\n189\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.140\nAnd that's why IP is becoming more the\nfavored son, is because it's the new way,\n\n190\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.640\nthe way to go.\n\n191\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.750\nSo, if you don't see it,\nyou can download the net tools.\n\n192\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Net tools, yep.\n\n193\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.380\n&gt;&gt; And make that happen.\n\n194\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.923\nAnd so if you like ifconfig,\nit's still around, but\n\n195\n00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:49.460\nif you wanna jump on the future bandwagon,\nIP is the way to go.\n\n196\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.490\nNow of course, information is great,\nbut sometimes,\n\n197\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.000\nwe actually wanna do things,\nwhen it comes to networking.\n\n198\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.020\nTypically, when you get a computer, you\nturn it on, it just auto configs itself\n\n199\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.700\nfor the network, and\nthat's great, cuz we like that.\n\n200\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.040\nI hate having to type in IP configuration\ninformation, sometimes we have to.\n\n201\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.350\nBut typically, I just want to be\nable to turn on my computer, and\n\n202\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.020\nit gets that information through DHCP.\n\n203\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.020\nDHCP is nice.\n\n204\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.060\nHow do we do that inside of our Linux box?\n\n205\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.970\nIf you come from Windows world,\nyou know that we use ipconfig.\n\n206\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.390\nSlash release, or slash renew, and\nthose things typically make this happen.\n\n207\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.250\nObviously, you start the computer, if\nthe DHCP agent is there, it will run, and\n\n208\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.600\ndo the whole due process, and\n\n209\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.140\nit's a gradual time, you get your\ninformation, and you're off to the races.\n\n210\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.040\nBut every now and then, you've got to do\nthat release for a new types situation.\n\n211\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.690\nHow do I do that inside the Linux?\n\n212\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.460\nLet's jump back to the screen,\nlet's see how that happens.\n\n213\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.102\nWe do that for\nthe use of a command called dhclients.\n\n214\n00:10:48.102 --> 00:10:50.980\nLet me clear the screen early quickly, and\n\n215\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.160\nlooks like this dhclient here,\nwe go just like that.\n\n216\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.380\nAnd as usual, when it comes to\nissuing a command, remember,\n\n217\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.850\nyou might have multiple adapters.\n\n218\n00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.580\nSo you're gonna have to tell what\nadapter you wanna work with.\n\n219\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.683\nAnd you're gonna throw a couple\nswitches at it before you do that, so\n\n220\n00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:08.606\nit knows what to do.\n\n221\n00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:13.539\nEach client, -r will, basically,\nI think it stands for reload or release,\n\n222\n00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.800\nsomething, I think it's reload.\n\n223\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.986\nBut it's gonna try to, even though that's\na weird misnumber for what we're about to\n\n224\n00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:25.830\ndo, which is release my IP configuration\nthrough the DHCP utilities, right?\n\n225\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.640\n-R, and that's how I remember it.\n\n226\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.318\nI think of it as release,\nwe'll see, I'll show you.\n\n227\n00:11:30.318 --> 00:11:31.684\nLet me just run it here really quickly.\n\n228\n00:11:31.684 --> 00:11:35.670\n-R, and then I'll throw it\nat ethernet zero, and Enter.\n\n229\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.090\nYou'll notice you'll see\nthis cannot reload action,\n\n230\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.246\nreload failed on some services that\nI have running, not a big deal.\n\n231\n00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:50.208\nIf I do my ifconfig or ipaddr, you'll\nnotice I no longer have an IPv4 address.\n\n232\n00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:54.210\nI have an IPv6, but IPv4 is gone.\n\n233\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.584\nIt's cuz I've released that, the IP,\nor the DHCP server out there has now\n\n234\n00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:02.197\nreclaimed that, and\nis ready to send that to anybody else that\n\n235\n00:12:02.197 --> 00:12:04.970\nmight request a address-\n&gt;&gt; Basically, you've just thrown\n\n236\n00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.760\naway your lease from the DHCP, and\nnow your address list as far as IPv4 goes.\n\n237\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.710\n&gt;&gt; Got it, perfect.\n\n238\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.138\nMike is always on the ball.\n\n239\n00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:13.737\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's a smart guy, that Mike.\n\n240\n00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:14.707\nYou should listen to him.\n\n241\n00:12:14.707 --> 00:12:15.696\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm just listening to you.\n\n242\n00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:16.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:16.223 --> 00:12:16.766\n&gt;&gt; Paraphrasing you.\n\n244\n00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:19.586\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm re-saying exactly what you\n\n245\n00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:20.360\njust said.\n\n246\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.815\nAll right, so now that we know how to\nrelease it, how do we get it back?\n\n247\n00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:29.880\nWell, you're basically just chucking\nthe DH client, command back at it zero.\n\n248\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:36.900\nI like to add a -v, right, so dhclient,\n-v gives me some verbosity, right?\n\n249\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.740\nSo, tell me what you're doing a little\nbit, and we'll see what's going on.\n\n250\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.270\nAnd then, of course, eth0,\nnow we see if things are happening.\n\n251\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.560\nAnd you'll notice this is our lovely\ndoor of process, this is happening.\n\n252\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.340\nThere's the request, the offer,\nthe acknowledgement.\n\n253\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.630\nYes, we all know that.\n\n254\n00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.830\nIt's fun stuff, you'll discover.\n\n255\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.500\nAnd now, I should have bound to zero,\nthis IP address.\n\n256\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.780\nAnd of course, if I run ipaddr,\nthere we go, eth0, there's iNet.\n\n257\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.950\nAnd we now.\n\n258\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.620\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n259\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.550\nvery simple process,\nnothing too difficult.\n\n260\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.710\nAny issue,\n\n261\n00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.980\nI am confident we'll be able to run this\ncommand and work with as a DHCP client.\n\n262\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.390\n&gt;&gt; All right now, Daniel.\n\n263\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.538\nMost of our clients that\nare typically set up to be DHCP, so\n\n264\n00:13:21.538 --> 00:13:24.382\nthey're gonna get that IP\naddress automatically.\n\n265\n00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:26.779\nWhat if need to statically\nmap a Linux box?\n\n266\n00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:29.829\nIs there a way that I can tell it\nwhat IP address I want it to use?\n\n267\n00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:32.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can totally statically map it.\n\n268\n00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:33.885\nIt doesn't work like it does in Windows.\n\n269\n00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:36.814\nActually, if you have a graphical\nuser interface, then yeah,\n\n270\n00:13:36.814 --> 00:13:40.134\nthere's probably some networking\ngraphical tool that you can jump in.\n\n271\n00:13:40.134 --> 00:13:41.834\nBut you gotta remember with Linux,\n\n272\n00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:44.450\nyou can't rely on what\ngraphical tool might be there.\n\n273\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.710\nWe gotta go with what's most likely\ngoing to be there, and typically,\n\n274\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.890\nthese are the CLI tools,\nifconfig, and ipaddr, right?\n\n275\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.180\nIP, should I say.\n\n276\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.530\nThose are most likely going to be in\nthere, so that's what we're teaching,\n\n277\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.620\nnot a graphical version of that.\n\n278\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.410\nSo let's take a look,\nlet's start with ifconfig.\n\n279\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.056\nI can add an IP address, so I have config,\nlet me release this thing a little quick\n\n280\n00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:13.450\nwith DH client -r, and then e to the zero.\n\n281\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.763\nThat way, we don't have, if I do\nan ifconfig, I have config, I should have\n\n282\n00:14:18.763 --> 00:14:24.259\nno IP address, so we can just play around\nand see these changes as they happen.\n\n283\n00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:28.002\nSo let's do ifconfig, config, and\n\n284\n00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:33.447\nthis is adding an IP address,\nifconfig, say eth0.\n\n285\n00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:38.064\nTell it what adapter it is, and then\nwhat do you want the IP address to be?\n\n286\n00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:40.815\nSo, we'll take, what was it before?\n\n287\n00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:42.567\nWe'll just steal that one.\n\n288\n00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:45.082\n192.168.219.147.\n\n289\n00:14:45.082 --> 00:14:50.870\nSo, 192.168 .219.147, so hit Return.\n\n290\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:57.209\nNow, if I type ifconfig,\nif I can do that, I'll just eth0,\n\n291\n00:14:57.209 --> 00:15:03.655\nhey, look, I have information,\nI statically set the information for\n\n292\n00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:08.450\nthat adapter using ifconfig,\ncan we delete that?\n\n293\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.882\nI think we can, but I'm not 100%\non how to do it with ifconfig.\n\n294\n00:15:12.882 --> 00:15:15.950\nI've gotten so use, it's been awhile\nsince I've really worked with ifconfig,\n\n295\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.070\nI'm used to ipaddr anymore.\n\n296\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.140\nSo, let's see how we add with ipaddr and\n\n297\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.680\nthen delete with ipaddr or\nIP, should I say.\n\n298\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.450\nYeah, it is ipaddr.\n\n299\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.720\nLet's do that really quickly.\n\n300\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.731\nSo, if I wanna do delete that with ipaddr,\ni-p-a-d-d-r d-e-l,\n\n301\n00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:38.964\nand then whatever it is, 192.168.219.147.\n\n302\n00:15:38.964 --> 00:15:43.025\nAnd there we go, not enough file,\nlet's see if it actually worked or not.\n\n303\n00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:49.580\nSometimes I get errors, but\nlet's see what happened here.\n\n304\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.832\nIfconfig, yeah, it still stayed.\n\n305\n00:15:53.832 --> 00:15:55.211\nThe dev argument is required.\n\n306\n00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:57.613\n&gt;&gt; Do we have to specify\nwhich ethernet adapter again?\n\n307\n00:15:57.613 --> 00:15:58.423\n&gt;&gt; Did I not do that?\n\n308\n00:15:58.423 --> 00:15:59.487\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n309\n00:15:59.487 --> 00:16:00.752\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you get the gold star.\n\n310\n00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He is correct.\n\n311\n00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:06.773\nIt does help when you say this\nis the adapter I want you to.\n\n312\n00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:07.275\nTo actually do this one.\n\n313\n00:16:07.275 --> 00:16:09.191\nSo, let's-\n&gt;&gt; So, that's a good point though.\n\n314\n00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:13.450\nYou might have several adapters, but only\none of them has that IP address assigned.\n\n315\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.700\nSo you might think, well, I can just\ntell it what IP address to remove, and\n\n316\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.350\nit'll figure out what network\nadapter to remove it from.\n\n317\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.850\nIt does not.\n\n318\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.140\n&gt;&gt; I totally should've picked that up,\n\n319\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.140\ncuz I was thinking about what\nthe next thing I was gonna do.\n\n320\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.422\nAnd I, this dev argument-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:30.978\n&gt;&gt; Linux usually doesn't say,\nbut when it comes to adapters,\n\n322\n00:16:30.978 --> 00:16:35.369\nit doesn't call it dev, it calls it eth0,\nor what adapter, it'll say,\n\n323\n00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:38.910\nadapter, just the saying dev,\nwell, what is dev?\n\n324\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.000\nDevice, what device is in\nthe device argument is required?\n\n325\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.720\nWhat device are you\ntrying to release from?\n\n326\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.604\nWell, it's ethernet zero, so\nI got add that to my line, so\n\n327\n00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:55.316\nif bring this back up IP,\nthe IP address, and\n\n328\n00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:59.545\nthen I say dev eth0,\nhopefully that does the job.\n\n329\n00:16:59.545 --> 00:17:05.757\nAnd, I get a warning, but we'll do\nIP addr eth0, and see what happens.\n\n330\n00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:11.407\nWe'll just do IP addr.\n\n331\n00:17:11.407 --> 00:17:12.746\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:14.040\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n333\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.089\nAnd yeah, now it's gone.\n\n334\n00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.600\nEth0 no longer has an IP address.\n\n335\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.050\nIt can get confusing,\nwhich brings up a good point.\n\n336\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.880\nIf you like ifconfig,\nlearn it, and stick with it.\n\n337\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.910\nCuz it'll get confusing,\ngoing back and forth there,\n\n338\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.900\nbetween ipadder and ifconfig, which\nis what's happening to me right here.\n\n339\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.090\nSo, word to the wise,\njust stick with what you know.\n\n340\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.310\nI would suggest learning ipaddr,\njust because you're\n\n341\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.425\nalmost guaranteed to see that in\nevery distribution that is modern.\n\n342\n00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you were saying earlier that\nifconfig is most likely going away on some\n\n343\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.330\nof these distros, so\nyou might as well learn the new stuff.\n\n344\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.210\nIt's like command prompt, PowerShell-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n\n345\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.455\n&gt;&gt; Command prompt's still there, but\n\n346\n00:17:52.455 --> 00:17:54.027\nyou might as well start\nlearning PowerShell.\n\n347\n00:17:54.027 --> 00:17:54.935\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n348\n00:17:54.935 --> 00:17:57.071\nMike, again, man, you're such a good help,\nyou're so great host.\n\n349\n00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:57.784\n&gt;&gt; I try to help, yeah.\n\n350\n00:17:57.784 --> 00:17:58.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n351\n00:17:58.592 --> 00:17:59.238\nI got another question for you, Daniel.\n\n352\n00:17:59.238 --> 00:18:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, we did ifconfig, and\n\n353\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.220\nyou assigned that IP address, and I\nnoticed that it took basically the default\n\n354\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.320\nsubnet mask for that class\n&gt;&gt; Is there a way I can specify\n\n355\n00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.070\na different subnet mask\nwhen I'm assigning that?\n\n356\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.570\nCan I assign an IP address, subnet mask?\n\n357\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n358\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.260\nWe can assign IP address, subnet mask,\n\n359\n00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.560\nwe can do if we're using ifconfig,\nuse the netmask command.\n\n360\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.919\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\ndot this is what I want my netmask to be.\n\n361\n00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:24.000\nAnd you gotta type in that\nblock address type thing,\n\n362\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.453\nwhere it's dotted decimal notation, or\n\n363\n00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:30.710\nyou can do the notation with IP addr, so-\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n364\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.930\nit's just another parameter you have\nto add, tell it what's going on.\n\n365\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Whatever your flavor is.\n\n366\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.835\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n367\n00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:37.867\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if we wanna demonstrate that,\nreal quick.\n\n368\n00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.618\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n369\n00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it,\nlet's just throw it out there.\n\n370\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:48.089\nSo, let's add using IP adder this time,\nlet's see,\n\n371\n00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:53.367\nIP addr, and I think it is add,\nand then 192.\n\n372\n00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:55.764\n192.168.219.147.\n\n373\n00:18:55.764 --> 00:19:00.780\nAnd then I can do slash, and\nwhatever I want it to be.\n\n374\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.220\nSo, if I want it to be a 16-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.970\n&gt;&gt; And then say dev eth0.\n\n376\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.005\nDon't forget that, Daniel.\n\n377\n00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:09.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bada bing, IP addr.\n\n378\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:14.910\nAnd then now you'll see that that\nis a class B type IP address.\n\n379\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.701\nSo, that's why, if you want to ifconfig,\n\n380\n00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:24.105\nit would just be ifconfig ethn0 netmask\n\n381\n00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:28.650\n255.255.0.0, so, right?\n\n382\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.650\nYou just hit Enter, and\nthat would take care of it.\n\n383\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.170\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one to know, cuz a lot\nof times, especially nowadays with class\n\n384\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.430\nlists and all of this, I love using ten\ndot networks, but still using a class C or\n\n385\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.853\n24 bit subnet mask in a lot of my test\nnetworks, because it's easier to type.\n\n386\n00:19:41.853 --> 00:19:42.841\n[LAUGH] I'm always looking for shortcuts.\n\n387\n00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:44.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, love that,\n\n388\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.840\nespecially when it comes to a test,\n\n389\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.080\nif you have to configure anything,\nusing CIDR notation is extremely easy.\n\n390\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.510\nLet's see if there's anything\nelse I want you guys to know.\n\n391\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.870\n&gt;&gt; What about, I was thinking this too,\n\n392\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.350\nsomething I do in Windows a lot\nis disabling my network device.\n\n393\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.470\nOr turning it off, turning it.\n\n394\n00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.590\nSometimes you just gotta kick it,\nright, to get it to work.\n\n395\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.210\nTurning it off,\nturning it back on sometimes works.\n\n396\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.000\n&gt;&gt; It does, and that's a good example.\n\n397\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.290\nI do this a lot,\nif I have a multi-home machine,\n\n398\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.580\nif I've got more than one adapter in it,\nand I wanna shut everything else off.\n\n399\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.120\nSo I make sure that one adapter's the only\none that's doing the talking, and for\n\n400\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.760\ntroubleshooting purposes, maybe.\n\n401\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.830\nAnd something we can use to help\nwith that is, good old ifconfig.\n\n402\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.470\nWell, at least in a certain way.\n\n403\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.503\nThere's, they've been kind of ported.\n\n404\n00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:28.427\nThere's two commands, ifup and ifdown,\n\n405\n00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:34.757\nwhich is basically an ifconfig adapter up,\nifconfig adapter down.\n\n406\n00:20:34.757 --> 00:20:37.390\nYou're turning them off,\nyou're turning them on, right?\n\n407\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.760\nSo, typically we're gonna,\nI don't know if I'm, ifup and\n\n408\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.740\nifdown don't seem to be very ubiquitous,\nyou might have them, you might not.\n\n409\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:52.940\nSo, let's see what happens here,\nifdown eth0.\n\n410\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.400\nUnknown interface, so it's here, but\nI don't have it configured correctly or\n\n411\n00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.030\nsomething, right?\n\n412\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.890\nAnd I gotta go in and do that.\n\n413\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.140\nBut basically what's happening is,\n\n414\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.870\nlet me do an ifconfig If I [LAUGH]\nI cannot type ifconfig today.\n\n415\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.570\nIfconfig, and\nthen saying eth0 down, right?\n\n416\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.610\nAnd then doing, I got no errors,\nthat adapter is down.\n\n417\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.670\nIf I do ifconfig, I look,\nit doesn't even show up,\n\n418\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.170\nand you notice I didn't say just\ngive me the loop back adapter.\n\n419\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I said, ifconfig,\n\n420\n00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.880\nshow me every adapter status, bada bing.\n\n421\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.460\nIt doesn't show up,\nbecause that adapter is no longer up,\n\n422\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.510\nit's not gonna give you\nany information about it.\n\n423\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.650\nIf I want it to come back up,\n\n424\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.260\nI would if I had correctly I would\nsay ifup, and then eth0 like that.\n\n425\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.250\nAnd of course, we get this whole unknown.\n\n426\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.770\nAnd it's a configuration file\nthat I just haven't done,\n\n427\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.580\nbecause this is stock install.\n\n428\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:48.450\nBut I can just do ifconfig, config,\nhow I wanna do the dif, I'll never know.\n\n429\n00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:54.050\nConfig, and then eth0 up like that.\n\n430\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.130\nThis takes a second,\nyou'll solve a couple of GUI things.\n\n431\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.080\nFlashing over maybe, if you were\npaying attention, or in this area,\n\n432\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.880\nyou saw little cable connecting.\n\n433\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.384\nDo ifconfig, I config [LAUGHS] I don't\nknow what's going on with my typing today.\n\n434\n00:22:08.384 --> 00:22:11.171\nAnd there we go,\nI'm back to getting a regular address.\n\n435\n00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:13.352\n&gt;&gt; Nice, very cool, very cool.\n\n436\n00:22:13.352 --> 00:22:15.120\nAll right, well, we're getting\na little short on time, Danny, but\n\n437\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.580\nthere's one more important thing that I\nthink that we wanted to talk about, and\n\n438\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.590\nI haven't seen it anywhere in here yet.\n\n439\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.250\nUnlike with Windows, where, when I go\ninto the GUI, for example, I've got my IP\n\n440\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.500\naddress, my subnet mask, my default\ngateway, and then I've got my DNS options.\n\n441\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.930\nAnd I don't see DNS in\nanything we've done so far,\n\n442\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.170\nand obviously, a very important\npart of setting our TCPIP config.\n\n443\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is very right, because you\ncan get all this stuff up and running, and\n\n444\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.410\nyou'll be working, but\nif you don't have DNS or a gateway,\n\n445\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.600\nyou're gonna have two major problems.\n\n446\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.820\nA, if you don't have a gateway,\n\n447\n00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.236\nyou're not gonna get out of\nthe network that you're on.\n\n448\n00:22:48.236 --> 00:22:52.420\nYou're gonna be isolated to that network,\nand if you don't have DNS,\n\n449\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.670\nyou're stuck using IP addresses.\n\n450\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.382\nThat's a no bueno time by\nanyone's standards, right?\n\n451\n00:22:57.382 --> 00:23:00.594\nSo, we need to be able to\nset those things as well.\n\n452\n00:23:00.594 --> 00:23:04.590\nSo, DHCP may not be doing that for you,\nor you need to set them statically for\n\n453\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.690\nwhatever reason.\n\n454\n00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.818\nMaybe you're testing or troubleshooting,\nthat could be the reason for that.\n\n455\n00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:10.111\nSo, let's see how we do that.\n\n456\n00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:11.631\nI'm gonna clear our\nscreen out a little bit,\n\n457\n00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:13.072\njust to get some of\nthe clutter out of here.\n\n458\n00:23:13.072 --> 00:23:16.200\nAnd let's start with a gateway.\n\n459\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.770\nSo, what you do is you say,\nroute add default gw, like that.\n\n460\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.360\nSo, basically you're using\nthe route command to add a route.\n\n461\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.251\nAnd if you have ever worked\nwith Cisco equipment, or\n\n462\n00:23:31.251 --> 00:23:35.982\nany kind of networking equipment per se,\nspecifically, Cisco's is very similar in\n\n463\n00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:39.812\nthe way that this comes out,\nsetting up that gateway of last resort.\n\n464\n00:23:39.812 --> 00:23:43.268\nIf I don't know where to go, go here,\nall right, and that's what we're doing,\n\n465\n00:23:43.268 --> 00:23:44.934\nthat's basically what we're doing.\n\n466\n00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:46.420\nWe set this gateway.\n\n467\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.070\nWhen I wanna get out of my local network,\n\n468\n00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.070\nhere is the path I take\nto get out of this thing.\n\n469\n00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:56.240\nSo, and that's typically your router\nof some sort that has access to that.\n\n470\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.020\nSo, let's set it,\nI can set it to anything I want, so\n\n471\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.913\nif I want to make this 102.168.219.1,\nI could do that, hit Return.\n\n472\n00:24:05.913 --> 00:24:09.277\nAnd that is now my default gateway, okay.\n\n473\n00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:13.454\nSo if you set all the IP information\ncorrectly, you go to get on the internet,\n\n474\n00:24:13.454 --> 00:24:16.860\nand you're not getting anywhere,\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n475\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:21.229\nmake sure, what's my router's IP address\nthat gets me out to the internet, and\n\n476\n00:24:21.229 --> 00:24:23.680\nlet me add that as a default gateway.\n\n477\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.690\nIf we wanna do DNS, this is the only\nthing that's a little weird,\n\n478\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.940\nit's not a command per se,\nit's modifying a configuration file, okay?\n\n479\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:38.360\nAnd the configuration\nfile is resolve.conf and\n\n480\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.650\nit lives in the etsy directory.\n\n481\n00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.270\nSo if I change directory to /etc and\n\n482\n00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:52.350\nI do like a cat resolve.conf.\n\n483\n00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.950\nThere is stuff in there.\n\n484\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.170\nAnd you will see I have\nbeen playing around so\n\n485\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.170\nhas this name server in here\ncuz I added that in there.\n\n486\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.050\nIf I wanted to add one of Google's\nname servers, I could do that easily.\n\n487\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.690\nI can either edit this file,\nI can open it up in an editor.\n\n488\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.410\nAdd the line to that I am about to show\nyou and then save it, and close it.\n\n489\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.420\nThat would be fine.\n\n490\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.440\nI like to do things shortcut.\n\n491\n00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.480\nI'm gonna show you the shortcut way.\n\n492\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.290\nSo what I can do is append to\nthe file to the command line.\n\n493\n00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:24.240\nIf you type in echo and\nyou say hi there, it'll echo hi there.\n\n494\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.028\nBasically, an echo.\n\n495\n00:25:25.028 --> 00:25:25.610\nJust like that.\n\n496\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:33.040\nSo I'm gonna echo what I want echo,\nand I'll say name server 8.8.8.8, and\n\n497\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.220\nthen I'll append that with two\ngreater than symbols together\n\n498\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.520\nto resolve.conf, and hit Enter.\n\n499\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:52.120\nAnd now if I can't resolve.conf you'll\nsee there's my name server addition.\n\n500\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.720\nAnd now, every time you try to do name\nresolution it will look at every one of\n\n501\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.050\nthese in this file and try them all.\n\n502\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.830\nAnd if one of them comes back with\nan answer, well there you go,\n\n503\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.400\nyou get to use name service and\nit's nice and we like it.\n\n504\n00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.440\n&gt;&gt; Very, very cool Daniel.\n\n505\n00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.300\nA lot of great stuff there,\nreally good look at\n\n506\n00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.760\nhow you set that TCP/IP configuration\nin a Linux world, right.\n\n507\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.010\nI mean the basics are the same,\nWindows, Linux.\n\n508\n00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.716\nYou need an IP address, a subnet mask,\n\n509\n00:26:14.716 --> 00:26:18.560\ndefault gateways are definitely handy\nif you wanna get off of your network.\n\n510\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.369\nDNS, very helpful if you don't know\nthe IP address of everything you wanna\n\n511\n00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:22.130\nconnect to.\n\n512\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.150\nBut then how you go about configuring it,\nWindows versus Linux,\n\n513\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.160\nlittle bit of difference there.\n\n514\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.080\nSo if we get a real good inside on the\ndifferent ways we can go about configuring\n\n515\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.240\nthat in a Linux environment\nfrom a command prompt.\n\n516\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.810\nWe saw ifconfig, the way we've done it for\nmany, many years.\n\n517\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.620\nAnd the new IP, right,\nthat we can now use.\n\n518\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.330\nA lot of these distros are including that,\n\n519\n00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.580\nand it's gonna be the new\nway to do things.\n\n520\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.120\nIt's kind of replacing good old ifconfig.\n\n521\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.920\nAs well as how to set that default\ngateway, with the route command and\n\n522\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:54.240\nset your DNS server address by\nmodifying your resolve.conf file.\n\n523\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.220\nSo we thank you for that, Daniel.\n\n524\n00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:55.770\nWe appreciate it.\n\n525\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.700\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n526\n00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.590\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n527\n00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n528\n00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.860\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.975\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here in ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.310\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.590\nAnd today we're doing our GIAC security\nessentials or G-Sec for short.\n\n6\n00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.060\nAnd in this episode in particular,\n\n7\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.860\nwe're gonna be continuing\non with our Linux overview.\n\n8\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.090\nAnd here to help us with that,\nof course, is Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.970\nHow are you doing, Daniel?\n\n10\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I'm doing fantastic,\nalways glad to be back in the studio.\n\n11\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.440\nAlways glad to be talking about Linux\nbecause it's a bit of a pet of mine.\n\n12\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.860\nI love it very much,\nI've been using it for quite some time.\n\n13\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.570\nAnd we've had a lot of good times,\nwe've learned a lot of stuff so far.\n\n14\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.170\nThis is like Mike says part\nthree of our overview of Linux.\n\n15\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.200\nBecause we wanna make sure\nthat even the uninitiated\n\n16\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.780\nhave some foundational knowledge\nof the Linux system itself.\n\n17\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.230\nBe able to work with it because not\neverybody was born with this information,\n\n18\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.910\nbelieve it or not\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.649\n&gt;&gt; And we all had to acquire it in some\n\n20\n00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.776\nway, shape or form.\n\n21\n00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:02.030\nAnd hopefully that's\nwhat you're doing today.\n\n22\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.240\nIf you have some Linux information\nalready, you've already worked with it.\n\n23\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.690\nThis is gonna be a good primer or\noverview for you and\n\n24\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.490\nstuff that you definitely need to know for\nthe GIAC GSEC exam.\n\n25\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.400\nSo that's the other reason we're\ngoing over the specific things that\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.680\nwe're talking today is because\nthat's what they want you to know.\n\n27\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.170\nSo without further ado let's go back into\nLinux, get your minds wrapped around it.\n\n28\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.050\nPrepare, body mind and soul,\nto receive the Linux information.\n\n29\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.480\nWe've talked distros,\nwe've talked networking.\n\n30\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.975\nNow let's talk about processes.\n\n31\n00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:38.520\nThese are things that we\ndo on our computers, right?\n\n32\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.780\nIf I have a computer running, I don't\njust turn it on to look at it and go wow,\n\n33\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380\nthat was a nice couple of grand\nI just spend on that machine.\n\n34\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.430\nIt sure is pretty.\n\n35\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.130\nI want it to do things, right?\n\n36\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.499\nAnd typically that's in the form of\na process when I start a service or\n\n37\n00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.650\nI want a program,\nit creates a process in the Linux system.\n\n38\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.530\nThere's actually a directory\ncalled proc which is for proxy.\n\n39\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.120\nWe're gonna talk about directories but\nlet's stay in here and now but\n\n40\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.620\nI just wanna throw that actually.\n\n41\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.770\nIt was a little taste of what's to come.\n\n42\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.400\nThere's a directory called proc and when\nyou create and when a new process starts.\n\n43\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.230\nActually creates a file inside\na proc that temporarily\n\n44\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.930\nexist there as long as\nthe process is running.\n\n45\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.621\nOnce the process is done,\nthe file goes away.\n\n46\n00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.955\nAnd that's because not every process is\nmeant to run from start to finish in your\n\n47\n00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:23.880\ncomputer.\n\n48\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.332\nAnd Linux [INAUDIBLE] see things as files.\n\n49\n00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:30.480\nIt's just interesting\naside on how Linux works,\n\n50\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.550\nit wants to see everything as a flat file.\n\n51\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.352\nSo there you go,\nyour Linux trivia for today.\n\n52\n00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:39.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why we have the proc directory\n\n53\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.260\nand that's what's happening\nwhen processes run.\n\n54\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.160\nNow we need to be able to work with\nprocesses, not just fire them off.\n\n55\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.320\nObviously if I wanna run nmap or\nif I wanna start telnet daemon or\n\n56\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.280\nsomething like that,\nI wanna be able to do it.\n\n57\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.290\nBut I also wanna be able to manage it,\nwork with it, see what's happening.\n\n58\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.367\nWhat is my computer running right now?\n\n59\n00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, that was one\nof my first questions is what's going on\n\n60\n00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:00.250\nalready that I don't know about.\n\n61\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd to the newer, uninitiated person\n\n62\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.180\ninto maybe not so much security but just\ncomputers in general, they don't realize\n\n63\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.000\nthere's a whole lot of stuff happening\njust from firing up the system.\n\n64\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.290\nA lot of times for\n\n65\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.460\nus to get a good baseline on how\nthe system normally performs.\n\n66\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.790\nA good way for us to do that\nis to see what is running and\n\n67\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.085\nhow we do that is a nice\nlittle command called top.\n\n68\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:27.860\nT-o-p like a top hat, right?\n\n69\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.300\nIt gives you I wanna say live,\nit is live in a certain way.\n\n70\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.250\nYou can increase or\n\n71\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.620\ndecrease how it looks to see what\nis running at that point in time.\n\n72\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.690\nI think it starts off by default\nevery second, it checks to see\n\n73\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.830\nwhat processes are running and then\ndisplays that to your terminal screen.\n\n74\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.300\nSo let's jump to my computer and\nlet's see what that looks like.\n\n75\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.410\nSo I am in my terminal.\n\n76\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.200\nIf I just type in top and hit return,\nI get this cool little output.\n\n77\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.820\nAnd look,\nit actually did something, right.\n\n78\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.420\nYou saw it kind of flicker, things change.\n\n79\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.000\nThere it goes again and one second\npasses and maybe one or two seconds.\n\n80\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.540\nBut basically, in one second,\nit passes the checks and\n\n81\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.000\nthen refreshes the screen, giving you\nthat output in as real time as possible.\n\n82\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600\nOne second should be sufficient for\nmost uses, but\n\n83\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.225\nyou can increase and decrease that.\n\n84\n00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:25.300\n&gt;&gt; So for us Windows faithful, would\nyou compare that to say Task Manager?\n\n85\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n86\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.830\nIf you used to task manager opening\nthat up, seeing what's running.\n\n87\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.710\nYeah, there it is,\nshows how much CPU is being used,\n\n88\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.610\nhow much memory is being used,\nwhat the process name is.\n\n89\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.000\nYou'll notice that's basically\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n90\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.320\nLet's take a look at the interface and\nsee what we can gleam from this.\n\n91\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.530\nYou can see that there\nare 136 total tasks running.\n\n92\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.980\nIt's giving us what\nthe screen can show us.\n\n93\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.760\nIf my screen was bigger or\nif I increased the resolution\n\n94\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.120\nto where the fonts were smaller,\nit would show me more information.\n\n95\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.410\nSo it's just showing me what I can\nactually page out at this point in time.\n\n96\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.550\nI think if I actually grab this and\npull it down.\n\n97\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.700\nYou'll notice we can\nactually see more stuff now.\n\n98\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.500\nSo just a little tidbit if you're\nworking in a graphical environment.\n\n99\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.660\nIf you're not, if you're just in a shell,\nthen you'd have to decrease the font or\n\n100\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.050\ndo something with resolution, so\nthat you can see more information.\n\n101\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.970\nOr know what it is you're looking for.\n\n102\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.070\nAnd we're not gonna get into how\nevery nook and cranny of top works.\n\n103\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.680\nWe just want you to know what it is,\nhow it works and\n\n104\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.930\nwhy you would want to know about it for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n105\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.410\nBecause what happens we get malware and\nif you're in a Windows environment and\n\n106\n00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.270\nsomeone complains about their computer,\nit's running a little slowly today.\n\n107\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.230\nI can't seem to get\nanywhere on the Internet.\n\n108\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.020\nYou bring up task manager and\nyou look, what is that process?\n\n109\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Does that look familiar?\n\n110\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Does it look familiar or it has some\nlike ominous name, that can be a key.\n\n111\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.920\nSo that's the same thing we're gonna\ndo here, run it for the purposes.\n\n112\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.480\nWe want to look at top,\nsee what's going on.\n\n113\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.900\nYou'll notice we have this PID field,\nthat's the process Id.\n\n114\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.240\nSo each process gets an identifier.\n\n115\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.520\nSo they can tell the difference\nwith one process in another.\n\n116\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.750\nSo if I start up the same process twice,\nall right.\n\n117\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.560\nIf it is just had Firefox,\nFirefox as my brand browser.\n\n118\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.280\nOkay, which one is which?\n\n119\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.520\nI have no idea.\n\n120\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.280\nSo process Id helps us out with that.\n\n121\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.480\nTheir user, which is the user\nthat is running that process.\n\n122\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.510\nYou'll notice I got a lot of route going\nhere because I'm logged in as route.\n\n123\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.190\nEverything, all the services I've\nstarted are starting as route.\n\n124\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.850\nLet's see here, what else is\nsome good stuff for us to know.\n\n125\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.730\nCPU time and memory percentage, right,\nthese two guys right here very important.\n\n126\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.010\nHow much CPU is being used up,\nhow much memory is being used.\n\n127\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.490\nWell, the cool thing is,\nis that it refreshes to descending.\n\n128\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.690\nIt starts with the greatest\nuse down to the least use.\n\n129\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.170\nSo whoever your top offender is by\ndefault is what's going to show us.\n\n130\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.820\nAnd both CPU and memory.\n\n131\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.340\nWhat else, how long it's been running.\n\n132\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.010\nYou'll notice, I guess we're running at\ntwo seconds here, that one four seconds.\n\n133\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.520\nBut that's how long it's been running,\nfive minutes and 19 seconds and it's XORG,\n\n134\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.920\nis the number, and that's the command,\nthe name of the command that is running.\n\n135\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.960\nSo now I can look through here, I see\nall sorts of stuff running, system D,\n\n136\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.570\nthat's my main server,\nwe talked about that.\n\n137\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.810\nJust trying to see anything interesting.\n\n138\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.890\nTop just showed up there, right?\n\n139\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.160\nIt started top, it's doing something.\n\n140\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.290\nIt actually took up some CPU cycles and\nshowed up in that iteration.\n\n141\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.250\nSo it showed up, I can know that.\n\n142\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.640\nTop is great for seeing what is running\nright now, how much it's using.\n\n143\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.000\nLike I said,\nyou can get more fine tuned with it,\n\n144\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.430\nchange the amount of time it runs.\n\n145\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.310\nMake it wait more time or less time.\n\n146\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.434\nMake it always show this\nprocess at the top.\n\n147\n00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:56.337\nThat kind of thing, but for right now,\nthat's basically what I want to show you.\n\n148\n00:07:56.337 --> 00:07:59.563\nThere's a couple other things\nyou'll see up here on the top.\n\n149\n00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:02.743\nThat's how many are stopped,\nhow many zombie processes you have.\n\n150\n00:08:02.743 --> 00:08:04.395\nI know it's a fun thing to say.\n\n151\n00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:10.890\nCPUs down here, memory swap file,\nall that's running.\n\n152\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:16.160\nHere's the total, how much is free, how\nmuch is being used, how much is in cache.\n\n153\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.493\nHow much is available, all that\nother good stuff, all right there.\n\n154\n00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:21.021\nSo like Mike said,\nif you come from a Windows world,\n\n155\n00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.720\nyou're used to seeing that kind\nof statistics from your machine.\n\n156\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.840\nTop is definitely a good place to go\nto get that same type of information\n\n157\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.980\nin a terminal environment.\n\n158\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.760\nObviously, there are graphical\ntools available for\n\n159\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.960\nevery one and\nevery type of way and flavor.\n\n160\n00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.271\nAnd you can get into your favorite\nflame war on why you prefer this\n\n161\n00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:43.442\ngraphical tool for system information\nversus that one and that one's stupid and\n\n162\n00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:46.467\nno one should ever use that and\nonly idiots play with that.\n\n163\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:47.899\nThat's usually what it is.\n\n164\n00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:49.209\n&gt;&gt; You see a lot of that in Linux 4.\n\n165\n00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:50.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It kind of descends\ninto that at level L.\n\n166\n00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:53.463\n[LAUGH] Unfortunately a lot of times so\ngo there and\n\n167\n00:08:53.463 --> 00:08:56.785\ncheck those out if you want\na more graphical representation.\n\n168\n00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:59.550\nBut top is what you need to know for\nthe exam itself.\n\n169\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.070\nAll right, so, we're talking processes,\n\n170\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.340\nthis isn't the only place you can look for\nprocesses.\n\n171\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.920\nThe other place, is, to get out\nof top by the way you press Q and\n\n172\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.140\nyou notice this thing stopped\nit dropped me back to a prompt.\n\n173\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.430\nSo I can clear that or\nI can just type clear like that.\n\n174\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.360\nAnother way we can check processes,\nwhat are running,\n\n175\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.660\nbasically what am I running right now?\n\n176\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.652\nWhat I messed around with is PS.\n\n177\n00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:33.476\nI hit Return, I'm just getting a couple\nof things because PS is one of those\n\n178\n00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:37.239\ncommands where you kinda gotta\ngive it more information.\n\n179\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.040\nAnd again, you don't have to be\nan expert on PS to pass this exam,\n\n180\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.060\njust to know what PS does and\nwhy you would wanna use it.\n\n181\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.690\nSo that's what we're\ntrying to show you today.\n\n182\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.270\n&gt;&gt; So it's almost like a filtered\nview to just what you or\n\n183\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.440\nyour user is running right now?\n\n184\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, this is processes that\nI have actually started yourself.\n\n185\n00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Your terminal is the bash and\nthen PS is the command that you just rent.\n\n186\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.320\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nnail that on the head.\n\n187\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.790\nAll the thing I'm really running\nright now is I have a bash terminal\n\n188\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.660\nup which is what we're using to run PS,\nour MPS.\n\n189\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.440\nSo at that time our MPS has saw that PS\nwas running and that's what came out.\n\n190\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.638\nSo I got my bash and I got my PS.\n\n191\n00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:17.762\nNow there are other processes\nthat are happening and\n\n192\n00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:21.900\nsometimes PS doesn't cut the mustard,\nI need a little more.\n\n193\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.260\nSo if you add some extra zing doing dash,\nwhat was it A,\n\n194\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.320\nX I think it is, and hit Return, now it\ngets a little more feature full here.\n\n195\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.680\nWe're getting process IDs over here and\nas you can see it gives me every\n\n196\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.434\nprocess that I am running\nas myself right now and\n\n197\n00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:49.670\nprocess IDs and\nit's doing it in process ID order.\n\n198\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.750\nSo this is good to know.\n\n199\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.830\nA lot of this stuff is just system stuff\nthat you don't have to worry about.\n\n200\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.720\nAnd I'm gonna introduce you,\nit's probably not on the exam,\n\n201\n00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.840\nI didn't see it in any of the objectives,\nbut it's a little tool or\n\n202\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.200\nutility called Grip and it can help\nyou filter out some of this stuff.\n\n203\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.490\nIt's really easy to use so\nI'm gonna introduce you to that.\n\n204\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.320\nLet's say I'm running, there's IceWeasel\nin here, yeah there's IceWeasel,\n\n205\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.470\nbasically a version of Firefox,\nthey're play on IceWeasel, right.\n\n206\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.630\nSo I'm gonna start IceWeasel and\nlet that get fired up,\n\n207\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.260\ncome on IceWeasel, you can do it.\n\n208\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.190\nThere you go.\n\n209\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.638\nSo just a web browser, and\nI'm gonna just minimize it.\n\n210\n00:11:26.638 --> 00:11:35.110\nI'm gonna run ps-ax -ax again, great.\n\n211\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:40.260\nNow I can see there's Isqueezer\nright there, there's its process ID.\n\n212\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.050\nWhat terminal it's running in,\nhow long it's been running.\n\n213\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.410\nSome basic information about it,\nall right?\n\n214\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.740\nThat's what we're looking at and\nthe command that it is running under.\n\n215\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.579\nYou'll notice you get full command\npaths on a lot of the stuff.\n\n216\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.690\nWhat's being run here?\n\n217\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.580\nUser lib tracker,\nthis is all onto the file structure,\n\n218\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.640\nwe'll get into that a little bit later,\nbut IceWeasel, very similar.\n\n219\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.140\nWhat if I start an IceWeasel when\nI got to work this morning, and\n\n220\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.370\nI kept it running and\nI had a few tabs open?\n\n221\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.330\nAnd I did some other things, but I keep\nit running, I just keep it minimized.\n\n222\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.540\nI come back, I do a few things,\nand then I go back and\n\n223\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.360\nthen I'm trying to show you\nguys this on the show and\n\n224\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.110\nI'm like, let's look for\nIceWeasel which I started four hours ago.\n\n225\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.520\nAnd I've started umpteen different other\nstuff before we got to this point in time.\n\n226\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.150\nI'd have to sift through all of\nthis information looking for\n\n227\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.950\nIceWeasel, that's not fun.\n\n228\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.810\nSo we can use Grip to help us out, so\n\n229\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.550\nhow do we do that All you do is\njust run your command again ps -ax.\n\n230\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.740\nGive it a space and a pipe command\nwhich is that straight up and\n\n231\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.710\ndown key which should be\ntypically is above your Enter key.\n\n232\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.450\nSo that's, look for it around that area.\n\n233\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.140\nStraight up and down.\n\n234\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.130\nIt might be broken in half.\n\n235\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.130\nMight be two little pieces, in front of my\nface, might be two little pieces of stick\n\n236\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.370\nbut typically it's just a straight up and\ndown line.\n\n237\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.237\nIf you hold Shift and hit that, it's\nthe same as the backspace key, actually.\n\n238\n00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:02.195\nOr not backspace,\n&gt;&gt; Back slash.\n\n239\n00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:04.590\n&gt;&gt; The back slash, thank you Michael.\n\n240\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.820\nAnd that gives it, there we go,\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n241\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.780\nAnd then just do Grep like that, G-R-E-P,\nand then whatever it is I'm looking for,\n\n242\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.650\nso something that's going to\nset it apart from other things.\n\n243\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.140\nAnd IceWeasel is probably a good\n\n244\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.310\ndifference from other\nprocesses that are running.\n\n245\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.270\nSo I can just, iceweasel,\nright, E-A-S-E-L, hit Enter.\n\n246\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.650\nNotice, I didn't get\nall the regular output.\n\n247\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.380\nI only got what I was looking for.\n\n248\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.211\nI got two things.\n\n249\n00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:35.360\nI got Iceweasel and\nI got Grep Iceweasel and\n\n250\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.000\nwhen I ran the PS command Grep ran and\ntherefore I get two outputs and\n\n251\n00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.140\nthat's what I'm looking for right but\ndefinitely narrowed things down.\n\n252\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.680\nSo if I'm looking for malware I'm\nlooking for that specific process and\n\n253\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.880\nI want to kill it that's what I'm going to\nneed because I need that process ID For\n\n254\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.640\nIce Weasel.\n\n255\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.170\nIf Ice Weasel's just run amok,\nI've downloaded a version of it, or\n\n256\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.380\nan update, messed it up, and\nit's got a memory leak, and\n\n257\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.510\nit's just crashing things, or\nit's just crashed, and it won't kill.\n\n258\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.560\nI'm hitting the X, and\nnothing is happening.\n\n259\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.280\nIt's just sitting there frozen.\n\n260\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.430\nI might need to find out what its process\nID is so that I can kill that process.\n\n261\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.110\nTypically what we're doing\nwhen we're looking for\n\n262\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.640\nprocesses, I want to stop them\nbecause they've causing a problem.\n\n263\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.460\nOr it's malware and I totally want to stop\nthat process, and I want to make it end.\n\n264\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.170\nSo pretty simple.\n\n265\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.340\nPs, a very nice utility, find out what\nyou're running, find out that process ID.\n\n266\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.410\nAnd it's not constantly top words,\nchanging all the time.\n\n267\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.710\nPS just shows you this is what's\nrunning right now, here you go.\n\n268\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.010\nAnd it doesn't change.\n\n269\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.740\nI can sift through it at me leisure,\n\n270\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.630\nfind the process I'm looking for, Use Grep\nif I need to, to filter things out and\n\n271\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.730\nthen go from there to kill or\ndo whatever I need to do.\n\n272\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.550\nAll right, that being said,\nwhere do we wanna go from here?\n\n273\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.300\nSo, another kind of in the family\nthere is another thing called Jobs.\n\n274\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.200\nJobs doesn't so much show you processes\nthat are running, it shows you stuff that\n\n275\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:14.680\nyou have started in,\nit's hard to explain this, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:20.370\n&gt;&gt; If I start a process or I run a script,\nand I do something with it,\n\n278\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.820\nit's going to be in jobs, all right?\n\n279\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.930\nBut if I start some, let's do it this way.\n\n280\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.700\nI'm gonna run iSqueezel from my terminal.\n\n281\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.260\nInstead of clicking the handy\nlittle icon let's go over here and\n\n282\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.420\nclose it just so we don't get confused.\n\n283\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.947\nI'm gonna close it down, it's done.\n\n284\n00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:41.661\nIf I run ps/ax Grep Iceweasel.\n\n285\n00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.080\ne-a-s-e-l.\n\n286\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.270\nI'm probably gonna get my Grep and\nthat's it, right?\n\n287\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.310\nCuz Iceweasel's been dead.\n\n288\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.700\nIt's not longer a running process.\n\n289\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.648\nBut if I do this,\n\n290\n00:15:53.648 --> 00:15:57.602\nI do iceweasal.\n\n291\n00:15:57.602 --> 00:15:58.401\nI hit Enter.\n\n292\n00:15:58.401 --> 00:16:03.167\nWhich is the binary Executable\nfile that starts IceWeasel,\n\n293\n00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:07.598\ngreat, IceWeasel came up, but\nlet's look at my terminal.\n\n294\n00:16:07.598 --> 00:16:12.450\nIt's over here blinking and\nI've kind of lost my terminal.\n\n295\n00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is where Jobs can come in handy,\n\n296\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.122\nit can help us out, and let's,\n\n297\n00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:21.046\nI guess I kind of went around my\nelbow to get to my back on this one,\n\n298\n00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:25.534\nlet's talk about why Jobs is important and\nwhy what's happening here.\n\n299\n00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:29.922\nWhen I ran that command, it took over the\nbash process, and it's waiting for it to\n\n300\n00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:34.499\nend before bash can come back, right, and\nbash is our term, or our born again shell,\n\n301\n00:16:34.499 --> 00:16:38.800\nit's our shell that we're looking at\ninside this black box, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.813\nSo bash has said, okay, I'm timing out\nhere, go ahead, run IceWeasel when you're\n\n303\n00:16:42.813 --> 00:16:46.187\ndone, and you release the process,\nI'll come back and be bash again.\n\n304\n00:16:46.187 --> 00:16:48.946\n&gt;&gt; So, normally when you run\na command from the terminal,\n\n305\n00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:52.175\nyou type in say IF config,\nlike we learned in a previous episode,\n\n306\n00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:55.757\nit runs the command, it spits the output,\nbut now the command is done and\n\n307\n00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:58.961\nyour prompt comes right back,\nroot ad, whatever, whatever.\n\n308\n00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:02.832\nWhen you ran IceWeasel, and IceWeasel's\nnot done, it's still running, so bash is\n\n309\n00:17:02.832 --> 00:17:06.971\njust sitting there saying, I'm running it,\nI'll let you know when it's done, but it's\n\n310\n00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:10.722\nnot like a command where it's actually\ngoing to end, you need to actually end it.\n\n311\n00:17:10.722 --> 00:17:11.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike totally nailed it, and\n\n312\n00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:13.664\nthat's why I love having him on the show,\nright?\n\n313\n00:17:13.664 --> 00:17:15.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The man is brilliant,\n\n314\n00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.911\nhe's sharp as a tack, that Mike Rodrick.\n\n315\n00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n316\n00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:20.892\nhopefully you understand it as well,\nright, cuz it was very well said,\n\n317\n00:17:20.892 --> 00:17:24.417\nthat's what's happening, short commands,\nyou throw them, you run them, they run,\n\n318\n00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:26.790\nthey spit out some output and it's done.\n\n319\n00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.973\nThis command is waiting for\nmore input, and\n\n320\n00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:33.287\nit's waiting to be used until you're done\nwith it and you'll tell it to stop, right?\n\n321\n00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:39.790\nSo the terminal has to relinquish control\nuntil you tell it to stop this process.\n\n322\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:45.590\nNow this is a graphical process, it could\nwell be a script that's doing a backup or,\n\n323\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.629\nI don't know, counting pi out to, [LAUGH].\n\n324\n00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:51.940\n&gt;&gt; An Nmap network scan that could\ntake 20 minutes or something.\n\n325\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, anybody that's ever ran a UDP\nNmap scan knows that joker takes a while.\n\n326\n00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.426\nIt's not gonna be 2 seconds,\nit's gonna be 20, 30 minutes long,\n\n327\n00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:02.140\ndepending on the machine.\n\n328\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.711\nSo, processes they can take first,\nso what do we do?\n\n329\n00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:06.820\nWell, we can open up another terminal.\n\n330\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.583\n&gt;&gt; We could just leave that\nterminal sitting there and\n\n331\n00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:10.351\nkind of put it off to the side and\nstart another one?\n\n332\n00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:14.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I can open up another\nterminal, but now I've got another process\n\n333\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.450\nrunning and it's depleting system\nresources, so what do I do?\n\n334\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.518\nI can actually start the process and\nthen push it to the background.\n\n335\n00:18:23.518 --> 00:18:26.530\nRight on, that sounds cool,\nhow the heck do I do that?\n\n336\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.870\nVery simple, let's, that's funny,\nI'm getting errors to the screen here from\n\n337\n00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.048\nIceWeasel, right,\nbecause it's interacting with that.\n\n338\n00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:39.120\nSo, let's kill IceWeasel here,\ngoodbye IceWeasel, nice having you.\n\n339\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.812\nAnd now we're back, we got our shell back.\n\n340\n00:18:41.812 --> 00:18:42.965\nOur shell back, that's funny.\n\n341\n00:18:42.965 --> 00:18:44.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.551\n&gt;&gt; So, what I do is I can run the same\n\n343\n00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:51.367\ncommand, IceWeasel, but\nthis time I do an ampersand like this, and\n\n344\n00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:56.017\nthat will actually start the command and\nrun it in the background,\n\n345\n00:18:56.017 --> 00:19:00.438\nit won't, it basically forks\noff into its own shell, right?\n\n346\n00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:04.179\nThat's kind of what's happening here,\nif not actually what's happening.\n\n347\n00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:09.261\nIt's saying, okay, you wanna continue\nusing the terminal, well, I'll give\n\n348\n00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:14.275\nit its own subprocess and let it run, and\nwhen it's done, I'll relinquish that and\n\n349\n00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:19.780\nwe'll go on, so if I hit that, hit return,\nyou'll notice IceWeasel comes up.\n\n350\n00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.016\nI can minimize that, I go back to me and\nlook at that, I still have my shell.\n\n351\n00:19:24.016 --> 00:19:28.509\nI can do a ps-ax if I want,\ncuz things are still working, right,\n\n352\n00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:31.530\nand I have control over my shell still.\n\n353\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.754\nThat process gets pushed to background,\nthere's IceWeasel right there,\n\n354\n00:19:35.754 --> 00:19:36.549\nas a process.\n\n355\n00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:38.490\nNow, I had mentioned Jobs,\nwhy didn't I use Jobs?\n\n356\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.923\nLet me just show you what's going on here,\nso let's do jobs.\n\n357\n00:19:41.923 --> 00:19:46.851\nAnd look at that, jobs shows me\nwhat is running in the background,\n\n358\n00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:50.040\nor, are there any paused jobs?\n\n359\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.193\nPaused jobs, what does that mean?\n\n360\n00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:55.100\nIt means I can actually pause\nsomething that's running.\n\n361\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:01.147\nSo let's do this, let's kill\nIceWeasel again, goodbye IceWeasel,\n\n362\n00:20:01.147 --> 00:20:05.780\nit was nice knowing you, and\nwhat we'll do is I'll run\n\n363\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:11.018\nIce Weasel like I did before,\nwhere it took over my terminal,\n\n364\n00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:15.584\njust remove our ampersand,\nif I can get back to that.\n\n365\n00:20:15.584 --> 00:20:17.634\nNow what do I do, right?\n\n366\n00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:20.900\nAnd I do this all the time,\nI'm sure you will as well.\n\n367\n00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.771\nWhat you can do is just come into\nyour thing, you're terminal here,\n\n368\n00:20:26.771 --> 00:20:31.024\nand hit CTRL+Z, and\nyou'll notice it stopped,\n\n369\n00:20:31.024 --> 00:20:36.204\nit's not done, it's not gone,\nit is paused, basically.\n\n370\n00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:41.102\nSo if I run jobs, it's just kinda\nsitting there, it's still there, but\n\n371\n00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:45.614\nit's not doing anything,\nit's not accepting input or anything.\n\n372\n00:20:45.614 --> 00:20:49.458\nIt's kind of in limbo state, so\nif I do that CTRL + Z keyboard,\n\n373\n00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:54.029\nI can still pause, regain my terminal,\ndo some things that I need to do, so\n\n374\n00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:59.328\nif I accidentally didn't start it in the\nbackground, I'm like, well, I'm too deep\n\n375\n00:20:59.328 --> 00:21:04.263\ninto this to kill it and start all over,\nmaybe I'm running a root force scanner or\n\n376\n00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:09.960\nsomething like that, or a password\ncracker, I'm like, man, why did I do that?\n\n377\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.775\nI can do a CTRL+Z, it'll pause that right\nwhere it's at, I can use my terminal,\n\n378\n00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:17.112\ndo what ever I need to do, and then I\ncan bring it back to the foreground.\n\n379\n00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:19.610\nHow do I do that,\nhow do I bring it back to that foreground?\n\n380\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:24.876\nEasy, you type in fg at the terminal for\nforeground, and Return,\n\n381\n00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:30.061\nand off it goes, and now you'll\nnotice I lost my terminal again.\n\n382\n00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:30.808\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n383\n00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:35.505\nSo, that was stupid of me, I just did the\nexact same thing that I'm kicking myself\n\n384\n00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:38.720\nfor doing, I put in there,\nI lost my terminal control.\n\n385\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.766\nAll right, CTRL+Z, pause it back,\nI could continue doing that, CTRL+Z,\n\n386\n00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:46.934\nwhatever I need to, and going back to the\nterminal and doing whatever I need to and\n\n387\n00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:50.919\nthen jumping back to IceWeasel, or\nmy password cracker, for instance, but\n\n388\n00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:52.433\nI need to get smart, right?\n\n389\n00:21:52.433 --> 00:21:56.479\nSometimes I don't wanna continue\nto switch back and forth,\n\n390\n00:21:56.479 --> 00:22:01.654\nI wanna restart the process but I wanna\nput it in the background so I just do bg.\n\n391\n00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:06.039\nAnd now IceWeasel, you notice that\nlittle ampersand jump back over here,\n\n392\n00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:10.590\nright there, put that process\nright back into the background.\n\n393\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.752\nSo fg for foreground, bg for background,\nyou can also kill processes this way.\n\n394\n00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:20.414\nAnd yeah, you'll notice it's still giving\nme errors, I would have to finagle\n\n395\n00:22:20.414 --> 00:22:24.670\nthe command itself, to dump errors\naway from the terminal to not see it.\n\n396\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.982\nBut I can still use,\nit didn't take over my terminal, so\n\n397\n00:22:27.982 --> 00:22:30.540\nthat was actually good that that happened.\n\n398\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.909\nJust because you're seeing errors from\nstuff that's running in the background\n\n399\n00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:37.327\ndoesn't mean that you don't still have\ncontrol of your terminal, you do, it's\n\n400\n00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:40.763\nstill there, you just have to press Enter\na couple times or something to see that.\n\n401\n00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:45.270\nI can't believe it, sometimes I've done\nit where I'm like, what's going on here?\n\n402\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.450\nThat's right, I have a background process\nrunning and it's errors or something.\n\n403\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.388\n&gt;&gt; I came to you one time\nwith that same thing.\n\n404\n00:22:50.388 --> 00:22:51.978\nI was like, I don't know what's\ngoing on here, what did I do?\n\n405\n00:22:51.978 --> 00:22:55.898\nAnd you're like, hit Enter a couple\nof times, there we go, that was easy.\n\n406\n00:22:55.898 --> 00:23:00.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love simple fixes like that and\nhopefully you do as well.\n\n407\n00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:02.129\nAll right, let's see,\nwhere we are at here?\n\n408\n00:23:02.129 --> 00:23:05.031\nWe have done TOP,\nwe've done PS, we've done Jobs,\n\n409\n00:23:05.031 --> 00:23:08.460\nand let's kill a process,\nlet's kill what's going on here.\n\n410\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:14.400\nSo if I do Jobs, I can see that\nIceWeasel is running, IceWeasel works,\n\n411\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.356\nIceWeasel, Jobs works a little\ndifferently than like PS.\n\n412\n00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:22.720\nSo when you're on PS,\nit tells you the process ID.\n\n413\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.494\nHere we get this, it says 2,\nokay, that's the number and\n\n414\n00:23:27.494 --> 00:23:32.948\norder in which Jobs is counting\nthe things that we've run, right?\n\n415\n00:23:32.948 --> 00:23:35.681\nThis is the second iteration,\nso it will be 2.\n\n416\n00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:39.336\nAs far as this is concerned, if you\nwanna tell it 2, you have to do %2, and\n\n417\n00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:41.350\nthat's basically saying, number two.\n\n418\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.990\nI guess the number sign was taken in\nsomething else so they couldn't use it, so\n\n419\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.110\nthey use percent sign.\n\n420\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.439\nSo all you would have to do is say kill %,\nwhere's my %, there it is.\n\n421\n00:23:51.439 --> 00:23:58.177\nLink file, and then 2, and then,\nif I did Jobs, you'll see this terminated.\n\n422\n00:23:58.177 --> 00:24:01.097\nGive it a second or two for\nit to actually terminate Jobs again, and\n\n423\n00:24:01.097 --> 00:24:04.210\nthen there's no output because\nthat job was terminated.\n\n424\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:09.085\nSo, %1, %2, whatever the number is,\nif you want to just kill the first job,\n\n425\n00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:11.713\n%1, %2, %3, and so on and so forth.\n\n426\n00:24:11.713 --> 00:24:16.843\nIf you get to where it's a stubborn\nprocess and it's not dying,\n\n427\n00:24:16.843 --> 00:24:21.593\nadd a dash nine to that, so\nlike kill -9 %2, like that,\n\n428\n00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.457\nit's going, it's going bye bye.\n\n429\n00:24:24.457 --> 00:24:27.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It also works with your PIDs, so\n\n430\n00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:30.731\nif you have, I don't know any\nprocess IDs off the top of my head,\n\n431\n00:24:30.731 --> 00:24:32.874\nlet's start IceWeasel real quickly.\n\n432\n00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:37.610\n[LAUGH] I just cannot\ndo it to save my life.\n\n433\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My fingers are so lethargic today.\n\n434\n00:24:39.738 --> 00:24:43.696\nYou'll notice I've got a process ID there\nof, and of course I just killed it.\n\n435\n00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:46.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on, Lowrie, you can do this.\n\n436\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:54.758\nLet's go back here and do ps-ax,\n\n437\n00:24:54.758 --> 00:24:59.788\ngrip ice grip, IceWeasel.\n\n438\n00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:03.989\nThere we go, there it is,\nthere's the process ID,\n\n439\n00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:08.199\nalso got it when I started it,\nand I can do kill -9.\n\n440\n00:25:08.199 --> 00:25:12.603\nIf it's stubborn use the -9,\ndon't use it unless you need to,\n\n441\n00:25:12.603 --> 00:25:17.890\ncuz it's a little harsh on the system but\n2707, process ID, hit return,\n\n442\n00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:23.120\nand then run my same command again,\nand you'll see that it is gone.\n\n443\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.350\nSo that's how you kill processes, that's\nhow you find processes, that's how you\n\n444\n00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.592\nwork with processes, get them in, get them\nout, whatever you need to do with them.\n\n445\n00:25:29.592 --> 00:25:34.620\nThat should give you all the necessary\ntools to work with your processes.\n\n446\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.694\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you for that\ninformation Daniel, great stuff there.\n\n447\n00:25:37.694 --> 00:25:41.282\nWhen it comes to the world of security,\none of the things that we have to be able\n\n448\n00:25:41.282 --> 00:25:45.094\nto do is figure out what's running on that\nsystem and make sure it's the stuff that\n\n449\n00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:49.020\nwe want running and stuff that we don't\nwant running is not running, right?\n\n450\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.632\nFind those hidden processes,\n\n451\n00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:54.982\nthat malware that has maybe been running\nin the background and you didn't know it.\n\n452\n00:25:54.982 --> 00:25:58.064\nNow we know our commands,\nwe've got TOP, we've got PS, and\n\n453\n00:25:58.064 --> 00:26:01.741\nwe've got that Jobs to check our work\nwith our background processes, and\n\n454\n00:26:01.741 --> 00:26:05.176\nwe know how to pause them or stop them,\nand then, kill them, and then\n\n455\n00:26:05.176 --> 00:26:09.306\nforcefully kill them if we really want to\npull out that nine mill and take them out.\n\n456\n00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:12.209\nSo, dash nine with that kill, we love it.\n\n457\n00:26:12.209 --> 00:26:13.180\nThank you then for that Daniel.\n\n458\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.352\nI hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this one, signing off for\n\n459\n00:26:16.352 --> 00:26:18.460\nITProTV, I've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n460\n00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.248\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrey.\n\n461\n00:26:19.248 --> 00:26:20.292\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n462\n00:26:20.292 --> 00:26:27.805\n[MUSIC]\n\n463\n00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:31.055\n&gt;&gt; Thank

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.770\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our GIAC security essentials.\n\n6\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.930\nAnd specifically, in this episode, we're\nactually doing a little bit of a Linux\n\n7\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.890\noverview, kind of a primary\nto get us ready for\n\n8\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.980\nsome of the episodes to come featuring\nLinux and the ins and outs of Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.470\nAnd with me today to help us keep\n\n10\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.460\ngoing with our Linux\noverview is Mr Daniel Lowry.\n\n11\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.210\nHow are you doing, Daniel?\n\n12\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I come doing great, man.\n\n13\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.290\nI'm so glad to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.125\nWe've been having a really good\ntime with the Linux stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.010\nYou know I enjoy it\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n16\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.639\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit of my cup of tea.\n\n17\n00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.184\n&gt;&gt; He's our Linux guru.\n\n18\n00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:46.263\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:48.170\nOther than Don, he's smarter then me.\n\n20\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.595\nBut Don's smarter than everybody,\nso I don't take that personally.\n\n21\n00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:51.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With that being said,\n\n22\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.632\nI wanna get you guys caught up to speed.\n\n23\n00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.000\nI wanna get you guys smart when it\ncomes to knowing some Linux knowledge,\n\n24\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.020\nempowering you, slam that in the brain so\n\n25\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.060\nyou have another tool in the tool kit,\nas it were.\n\n26\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.460\nAnd that being said,\nwe're continuing our overview.\n\n27\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.680\nThis should be,\nif I'm playing my cards right,\n\n28\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.530\nit should be our last overview episode.\n\n29\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.250\n&gt;&gt; Don't believe him!\n\n30\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.020\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Mike's like this is never gonna happen.\n\n31\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.030\nBut we're gonna do it,\nwe're gonna trudge through.\n\n32\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.829\n&gt;&gt; Well, and I have the advantage of\nknowing what we are getting ready to\n\n33\n00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:20.370\ntalk about.\n\n34\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n35\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.580\n&gt;&gt; And, Daniel, I tell you, this is one\nof the areas that is a Windows guy,\n\n36\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.764\nwe've gone over setting your TCP/IP,\nand okay, it's a different command, but\n\n37\n00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:30.350\nsame concepts.\n\n38\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.150\nWe looked at services, and top, and\nsome different ways to start and\n\n39\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.920\nstop processes.\n\n40\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.000\nVery similar to Windows,\ndifferent interface obviously,\n\n41\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.230\na little different layout.\n\n42\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.730\nBut when it comes to this,\nit's a lot different.\n\n43\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where definitely\nLinux is a departure from\n\n44\n00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.710\nprobably any type of Windows\nsystem you've ever seen before.\n\n45\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.578\nAnd if you've been in Windows, which I\nhope you have, you probably are using\n\n46\n00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:57.166\na computer maybe to watch me right now,\nand it might have Windows on it.\n\n47\n00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.325\nWindows is a large share of the desktop\nmarket and for good reasons,\n\n48\n00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.275\nit's a great desktop operating system.\n\n49\n00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.502\nLinux is, what we're talking about\nwhen it departs is its file structure.\n\n50\n00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.525\nWhen you look at the file structure,\n\n51\n00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:12.310\nif you go into a Windows file structure\nyou typically see the C drive,\n\n52\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.675\nmaybe any CD-ROMs or\nfloppy disks if that’s still around.\n\n53\n00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:17.693\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If that's lurking in your system.\n\n54\n00:02:17.693 --> 00:02:19.872\nYou've got maybe a USB drive stuck in.\n\n55\n00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.784\nThey've all got drive letters, and\n\n56\n00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:25.190\nunderneath that is its\nhierarchy of files and folders.\n\n57\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.720\nAnd there's some structure to that,\nand it's native to Windows.\n\n58\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.350\nThat's the way they set it up.\n\n59\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.930\nThere will be a user's folder\nunderneath the C area, right?\n\n60\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530\nThere'll be a Windows folder,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n61\n00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.520\nLinux kind of does the same thing,\nbut here's the tricky part about it,\n\n62\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.560\nis because Linux is just a kernel and\n\n63\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.700\nthe file system that they\nput on it could be anything.\n\n64\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.225\nYou can make it anything you'd like.\n\n65\n00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, hey, it's my class, right?\n\n66\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.410\nAnd you can see that\nmight lead to a problem.\n\n67\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.710\nIf I make my file system\nhave this directory,\n\n68\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.455\nand that directory, Dan's directory,\nand Mike's, directory and\n\n69\n00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:01.325\nthen we jump into another system that\nMike created and he created directory 1,\n\n70\n00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:04.005\ndirectory 2, well,\nthere's no consistency between the two.\n\n71\n00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.840\nWell, the good news was they saw\nthat as an issue very early on,\n\n72\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.965\nand said you know what we needed to do?\n\n73\n00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:10.865\nWe need to basically standardize.\n\n74\n00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:12.765\nAnd this comes a lot from Unix as well.\n\n75\n00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:17.785\nUnix had a tried and true method of doing\nthis, so they said let's continue that.\n\n76\n00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:20.280\nRemember, Linux was supposed\nto be very Unix like.\n\n77\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.818\nAnd it's the way it operates.\n\n78\n00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.100\nSo, and\nwe're borrowing these things from Unix.\n\n79\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.980\nSo, we get a hierarchy, a file structure,\nthat you are going to typically see.\n\n80\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.200\nIt's very standardized.\n\n81\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.940\nIt won't be identical,\nit might be identical,\n\n82\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.190\nbut I can't guarantee that\nfrom system to system.\n\n83\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.970\nBut I will give you at least a many of the\ndirectories that you will probably find\n\n84\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.790\nin just about any flavor of Linux that\nyou download, install, and try to run.\n\n85\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.870\nSo let's take a look at that now.\n\n86\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.182\nLet's let's jump into my system and\ntake a look at the file system.\n\n87\n00:03:51.182 --> 00:03:53.510\nI'm gonna show you a really\nquick command here so\n\n88\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.290\nthat you can see things\ninside your system.\n\n89\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.120\nIt's called LS.\n\n90\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.890\nIt's basically to list out what's\nin the directory, ls like so.\n\n91\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.147\nAnd I can see the files and\nfolders, directories,\n\n92\n00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:06.680\nthat are in the directory I'm at.\n\n93\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.390\nIf you wanna see what directory you\nare in you can do pwd really quickly,\n\n94\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.900\nwhich is print working directory.\n\n95\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.307\nI can do that, and I can see that\nI'm in this /root directory.\n\n96\n00:04:15.307 --> 00:04:20.290\nAnd that is, comes underneath\nthe main root directory, and\n\n97\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.545\nthis is where it gets fun.\n\n98\n00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is where Linux gets,\n\n99\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.700\nthey're a jolly bunch of people,\nI'll give them credit.\n\n100\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.780\nThey love a good joke, they love\na good laugh, and this is one thing.\n\n101\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.520\nI don't know if they did this purposefully\nor if it just worked out this way.\n\n102\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.030\nBut there is the root directory and\nthen there is roots directory.\n\n103\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n104\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.930\n&gt;&gt; If you caught the subtle\nnuance there on the difference.\n\n105\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.120\n&gt;&gt; There was a possessive there\nin that second one, right?\n\n106\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n107\n00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.770\n&gt;&gt; I think I heard it.\n\n108\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike nailed it,\nhe's a grammarian.\n\n109\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.200\nI love him for it because that's right,\n\n110\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.440\nthere was a possessive on\nthe end of that last one.\n\n111\n00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.320\nThere is root's directory.\n\n112\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.540\nA root is a user,\nis the all-powerful user of the system,\n\n113\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.860\nand root has their own directory, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.115\nThe root directory is the beginning\nof the file system, and\n\n115\n00:05:05.115 --> 00:05:09.470\nit's just symbolized by\nthe forward slash symbol, right?\n\n116\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.020\nI think it's forward.\n\n117\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.510\nYeah, the forward slash symbol.\n\n118\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.260\nSo, I always get the forward slash and\nbackslash mixed up.\n\n119\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.590\nSo let's take a look at\nthe file system here.\n\n120\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.718\nAnd this is my [INAUDIBLE]\nLinux based off of Ubuntu.\n\n121\n00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:19.610\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n122\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.760\nI'm just gonna change directory\nback one because I'm only one deep.\n\n123\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.615\nYou'll notice that right here,\nthat I now have this forward slash,\n\n124\n00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:31.350\nthey're letting me know\nI'm in the root directory.\n\n125\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.600\nIf I do pwd, it shows me it's\njust the slash, all right?\n\n126\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.925\nSo, that's very important to know the\ndifference between the root directory and\n\n127\n00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:45.605\nroots directory, which is basically\nroots home folder, home directory.\n\n128\n00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:48.215\n&gt;&gt; Like any other user,\nevery user's gonna have a directory.\n\n129\n00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:50.655\nThey have root included has a directory.\n\n130\n00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:52.015\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's a good point.\n\n131\n00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:52.965\nLet's go there.\n\n132\n00:05:52.965 --> 00:05:54.862\nLet me do the ls command.\n\n133\n00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:57.612\nAnd we'll see,\nthere's the file system, right?\n\n134\n00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:00.302\nI'm in the main directory,\nthis is the highest level I can go,\n\n135\n00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:00.907\nI can't go any higher.\n\n136\n00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:04.000\nThere's nowhere to back up to,\nthis is basically if you're,\n\n137\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.692\nif I'm equating it to Windows,\nit's the C drive, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:08.762\nThat should help you out a little bit.\n\n139\n00:06:08.762 --> 00:06:10.752\nSo you'll see there,\nit is, where is it at?\n\n140\n00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:11.978\nThere's root, right?\n\n141\n00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:13.449\nThere's roots directory.\n\n142\n00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.220\nAnd then, Mike was talking about Users\nhaving their own home directory.\n\n143\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.990\nAnd that is found under,\nwell, how about that?\n\n144\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.030\nHome, right?\n\n145\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.930\nVery simple.\n\n146\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.600\nAnd again, these three things,\nroot directory will always be there.\n\n147\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.790\nRoots directory will almost\ninvariably be there as well.\n\n148\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.360\nAnd then, almost invariably,\nyou will also have a home directory.\n\n149\n00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.540\nAgain, standardization breeds ease\nof use between the distributions,\n\n150\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.090\nand that's what they want, right?\n\n151\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.235\nSo, under the home directory,\nif I'm a user on this system I'm DLowire,\n\n152\n00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:46.280\nMike's MRoderick or whatever.\n\n153\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.810\nWhen you create the user,\n\n154\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.770\nit usually creates a directory for\nthat user in the home directory.\n\n155\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.260\nSo I would have a DLowrie\ndirectory under home.\n\n156\n00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.550\nSo, my home directory would\nbe forward slash home.\n\n157\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.330\nForward slash DLowrie.\n\n158\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.807\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] my documents folder then?\n\n159\n00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:05.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nvery similar to that kind of thing, right?\n\n160\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.120\nSo, we're-\n&gt;&gt; Or your profile, anyway.\n\n161\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.060\n&gt;&gt; More like your profile,\nI think it's a better way to put it.\n\n162\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.460\nIf you're in Windows, you're under C, you\ngo into users, everybody that has logged\n\n163\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.390\nin, they get a folder and that holds\ntheir profile settings, their desktop,\n\n164\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.450\ntheir my documents folders,\nthings of that nature.\n\n165\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.240\nSame idea, it's just stored under\nthese slash home directory.\n\n166\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.040\nAnd then whatever forward slash your\nusername would be, would have one.\n\n167\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.920\nYou can create new ones,\nit doesn't have to be their username.\n\n168\n00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.780\nYou can make it Bob's home\ndirectory if you want.\n\n169\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.510\nOr call it, you know.\n\n170\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.940\nI'm just making up words.\n\n171\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.120\nBut that's the power of Linux.\n\n172\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.910\nIt just says, well,\n\n173\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.320\nif you're the system administrator\nyou can do whatever you like.\n\n174\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.650\nSo that's what we'll find.\n\n175\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.338\nLet's take a look at some\nof the other interesting,\n\n176\n00:07:48.338 --> 00:07:51.468\nand probably their directories\nyou'll find in the system.\n\n177\n00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:53.202\nLet's see here, let's look at bin.\n\n178\n00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:58.272\nSo we got bin, and\nalso I wanna show you s-bin.\n\n179\n00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:01.757\nAll right, so these are very\nsimilar types of folders, but\n\n180\n00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:06.180\nthey perform a different function,\nwhich is why there are two of them.\n\n181\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.490\nBasically, you're having your\nbinaries inside of these bin folders.\n\n182\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.800\nBin variants, I guess I could call them,\nfor the sake of brevity.\n\n183\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.690\nInside of bin,\nyou'll have programs that run.\n\n184\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.700\nI can call the executable, type it in,\nsomething like ps, or top, or whatever.\n\n185\n00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.340\nAnd it will run.\n\n186\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.360\nI also have sbin though, so what is that?\n\n187\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.230\nIt's kind of, it does the same thing.\n\n188\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.040\nAgain, I can put anything I want into\nthem, I can, I can just store files if I\n\n189\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.420\nfeel like it, but they break this up into\nthis type of structure for a reason,\n\n190\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:44.290\nand the reason is is that,\nmaybe I want system files, hence the sbin.\n\n191\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.970\nSo, some more system types, things that\nI'm going to see that are more system\n\n192\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.480\noriented, are gonna be in sbin, or\nsbin is gonna be more my local user.\n\n193\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.910\nBut we also have fun stuff, right?\n\n194\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.090\nYou've got this, where is it at here?\n\n195\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.640\nUser, usr, and\nyou'll never guess what's inside of that.\n\n196\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.730\nLet's go in there,\nlet's change directory, see the usr and\n\n197\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.590\nLS, look at there,\nthere is another bin directory, and\n\n198\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.240\nanother sbin directory, yes,\nthe rabbit hole goes deeper.\n\n199\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.870\nSo, be prepared for that.\n\n200\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.650\nThis is, again, for you as a user, and\n\n201\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.780\nyou can also find bins underneath\nyour home folder, I know.\n\n202\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.380\nIf it's not there,\nyou can create one, and it's fun.\n\n203\n00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.470\nBasically, these are just areas for\nus to put binaries, and\n\n204\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:39.390\ntry to segregate them by their purpose,\nand what you wanna use them for.\n\n205\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.180\nSo, if you're under your user local bin,\n\n206\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.030\nthis is stuff that I would\nwant [LAUGH] all users to use.\n\n207\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.410\nThat's it also, I'm sorry I forgot,\nthere's local [LAUGH] if we go into local,\n\n208\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.780\ncd local-\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell me.\n\n209\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.880\n&gt;&gt; It's getting fun, isn't it?\n\n210\n00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.260\n&gt;&gt; Do not show me a bin folder.\n\n211\n00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.314\n&gt;&gt; There is a bin, and\nan sbin folder in there, as well.\n\n212\n00:09:55.314 --> 00:09:57.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, just be aware that bin and\n\n213\n00:09:57.333 --> 00:10:00.901\nsbin basically one is typically for\nthe user, the other is typically for\n\n214\n00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.670\nsystem-wide type of things.\n\n215\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.460\nThat's, we're not gonna try\nto get too crazy with it.\n\n216\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.050\nWe just want you to be\naware of these things.\n\n217\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.030\nSo, I'm gonna back out of here.\n\n218\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.640\n&gt;&gt; It's the source of many a debate, I\nknow, because I remember when I was first\n\n219\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.050\nplaying around with Linux, and\nI was starting to get into scripts.\n\n220\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.450\nI was, okay, where's the best place?\n\n221\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.332\nI'm not a Linux guy.\n\n222\n00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:18.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where should I store my scripts?\n\n223\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.680\nAnd everybody had their own opinion,\nall right?\n\n224\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.410\nThere was no really one answer,\nbecause there are so\n\n225\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.610\nmany different places to put things.\n\n226\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like we've said before,\nyou can put it anywhere you want.\n\n227\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.110\nAnd especially if you're a system\nadministrator, nothing to stop you from\n\n228\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.270\nslapping it in the proc directory, or\nthe dev director, or the etc directory.\n\n229\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.462\nAnd all these other directories we see,\nwhen we do an LS at the root level, right?\n\n230\n00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:45.270\nLet me clear this screen, so\nwe can get some little clutter gone there.\n\n231\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.295\nLet's talk about those\ndifferent directories,\n\n232\n00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:50.572\ncuz we could spend forever and wax over\nwhat's going on different directories,\n\n233\n00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:53.715\nwhy certain things are done or\nnot done, or whatever.\n\n234\n00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:55.565\nLet's get you information, right?\n\n235\n00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.625\nThat's what we wanna do,\nand I'm going to beat him.\n\n236\n00:10:58.625 --> 00:10:59.934\nWe will get this episode-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:00.902\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n238\n00:11:00.902 --> 00:11:02.426\n&gt;&gt; So, let's talk about\n\n239\n00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:03.900\netc really quickly.\n\n240\n00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.725\nEtc typically has services and\n\n241\n00:11:06.725 --> 00:11:11.395\nconfiguration stuff, startup scripts,\nthings of that nature.\n\n242\n00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:13.710\nThey lie inside of etc a lot.\n\n243\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.780\nIf you're administering a Linux machine,\n\n244\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.270\nyou will probably spend\na bit of time inside of etc.\n\n245\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.560\nIf you remember when we\nwere doing the networking,\n\n246\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.880\nwe went into etc to configure our DNS\nnames, right, all our name servers.\n\n247\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.920\nI appended a file inside\nof the etc directory,\n\n248\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.870\nwhich was a configuration file, which as\na dot comp, it it was resolved dot comp.\n\n249\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.820\nSo, we'll see that,\nlet's go in there real quick, slash,\n\n250\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.240\nif you're ever just deep, deep,\ndeep into a directory, and\n\n251\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.470\nyou just want to go straight to somewhere,\nyou can just do slash.\n\n252\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.190\nAnd give it the full path name, so\nif I give it /etc here, I can do that.\n\n253\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.800\nI could also just done e-t-c, because it\nwas in the directory, and I'm in directly.\n\n254\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.421\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n255\n00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.437\nNow, let's see here, LS you'll see,\n\n256\n00:11:58.437 --> 00:12:02.806\nwe're seeing a lot of things like .com for\ngoing on here.\n\n257\n00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:07.124\nThese .d's are typically dames or\nservices, scripts that run those,\n\n258\n00:12:07.124 --> 00:12:11.654\nyou'll see that, typically that's what\nyou see a lot of configuration for\n\n259\n00:12:11.654 --> 00:12:13.870\nthe system, etc holds a lot of that.\n\n260\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.720\nSo, it's a very important folder, or\ndirectory Inside of your Linux systems.\n\n261\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Daniel,\nI see there's some color coding on there.\n\n262\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.880\nIs there a significance to that?\n\n263\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.440\n&gt;&gt; The significance is that with,\nthis isn't across the board,\n\n264\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.140\nbut you will see some color coding.\n\n265\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.200\nIt might not be identical to what\nyou're seeing on my system, but\n\n266\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.370\nthere might be color coding there.\n\n267\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.260\nYou might not have any color coding\nat all, but the color coding is nice,\n\n268\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.490\nmost people like it, I know I sure do.\n\n269\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.360\nThe blue in this system is letting\nme know that's a directory.\n\n270\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.970\nAll right, the white is\nletting me know that's a file,\n\n271\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.070\nthe green is letting me know it's an\nexecutable file and so on, and so forth,\n\n272\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.290\nthere's other colors as well,\nwe're just not seeing any here.\n\n273\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, the color coding can help.\n\n274\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.110\nIf you're in a headless system,\nwith just a black and\n\n275\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.970\nwhite monochrome thing going on,\nthere's other ways to see that.\n\n276\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.550\nWe're gonna get into that in a separate\nepisode, so just keep that in mind.\n\n277\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.480\nBut good question, Michael.\n\n278\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here,\n\n279\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.379\nwhat else do we need to see,\nlet's get out of here.\n\n280\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.370\nBack out of etc, and you notice I'm\njust using cd, change directory, and\n\n281\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.710\nthen dot dot goes up one directory.\n\n282\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Daniel,\nriddle me this, then.\n\n283\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.700\nSo, we've seen all these\ndifferent directories,\n\n284\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.840\nwe know we can do cd to\nkind of change directories.\n\n285\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.020\nI saw you doing a dot dot backslash\nto jump up one, I think higher up.\n\n286\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.560\nWhere is the actual, for\nlack of a better term,\n\n287\n00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.630\nand from my Windows point of view,\nwhere's your operating system at?\n\n288\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.410\nI know next up, you wanna talk\nabout the different partitions.\n\n289\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.750\nSo you don't really have a C drive,\nwhere do you install this to?\n\n290\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.440\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question,\nit's going under the boot,\n\n291\n00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.630\ncuz that's where it's booting from.\n\n292\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.280\nAnd a lot of times,\nwe're getting ready to talk about this,\n\n293\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.950\na lot of times people\nwill partition that off.\n\n294\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:53.330\nThey will make that its own partition on\nthe drive, so that you can back that up.\n\n295\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.560\nAnd you don't have to worry\nabout affecting everything else.\n\n296\n00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.370\nIf the OS becomes corrupted, right,\nyou can still go in and grab your files.\n\n297\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:06.040\nYou can just rebuild the boot\npartition and be able to log back in.\n\n298\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.170\nThat's a part of partitioning as a scheme.\n\n299\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.280\nHow do I wanna do this?\n\n300\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.960\nWhat might be beneficial?\n\n301\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.140\nIf you're just doing\na desktop home installation,\n\n302\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.730\nprobably right out of the gate,\nyou're just gonna do one large partition.\n\n303\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.440\nWe're gonna talk about\npartitioning in just a second,\n\n304\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.250\nbut that will be definitely\nunder the cd /boot, and\n\n305\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:27.650\nthat's gonna give you your basic system,\nyou'll see that vm thing right here,\n\n306\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.870\nand some configuration grub is the boot\nloader to help the system get started.\n\n307\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.870\nSo right there,\nthat /boot is a very important.\n\n308\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.177\nAnother important one if\nwe backup is cd /dev,\n\n309\n00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:44.800\noops, cd /dev, which is all the devices.\n\n310\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.200\nThey show up, remember,\nin Linux it's a flat file.\n\n311\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.870\nSo, they're giving it to you as a file.\n\n312\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.780\nYou'll see things like,\nlet me show you some important ones.\n\n313\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.470\nHey, DVD, that's good to know.\n\n314\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.540\nIt means it thinks it\nhas a DVD inside of it.\n\n315\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.630\nHey, look, it thinks CPU is a device\nbecause, hey, it is, right?\n\n316\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.110\nWe'll probably see things like,\nhere we go, SDA.\n\n317\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.450\nThis thinks it's a serial device.\n\n318\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.650\nFirst one, so letter A.\n\n319\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.780\nI could have SDB, SDC,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n320\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.880\nIt's basically a hard drive.\n\n321\n00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.120\nYou might see HDA,\ndepending on what type it is.\n\n322\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.240\nAgain, this is a virtual environment, so\n\n323\n00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.490\nit's seeing this as a serially\nattached hard drive.\n\n324\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.120\nSo it's showing up SDA, serial,\nbut it may be HDA or HBA, or\n\n325\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.960\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n326\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.820\nSo, just be aware, that's what it is.\n\n327\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.460\nAnd then this one, two, and five,\nthat's partitions on the drive.\n\n328\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.480\nSo, when you see SDA,\nthat's the drive itself.\n\n329\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.730\nYou see SDA1,\nthat's the first partition on the drive.\n\n330\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.319\nAgain, we're getting ready to talk more\nabout partitioning in just a second.\n\n331\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.300\nWhat else in here?\n\n332\n00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.977\nAnything super important?\n\n333\n00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:55.379\nNo, these TTYs are basically terminals,\nteletype terminals from the old So\n\n334\n00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.695\nwe can move into doing an installation.\n\n335\n00:15:57.695 --> 00:16:00.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This'll be my bash sessions,\n\n336\n00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.950\nmy ssh if I'm remotely logged in,\nmy cvt wise in here.\n\n337\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.536\nI don't think I have anything going on,\nso it's pretty straightforward.\n\n338\n00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:13.115\nBut yeah, Linux treats all\nyour hardware as a file, and\n\n339\n00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:16.325\nthat gets dumped here into\nthe lovely dev folder.\n\n340\n00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:17.537\nIt's very important.\n\n341\n00:16:17.537 --> 00:16:24.399\nLast one I'm gonna talk about is the,\nI don't need that, cd.., the proc, right?\n\n342\n00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:28.067\nRemember we talked about that yesterday,\nor in the previous episode should I say.\n\n343\n00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:30.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is the processes.\n\n344\n00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:32.277\nWhere do they go when I create a process?\n\n345\n00:16:32.277 --> 00:16:34.208\nWell, there's a proc directory.\n\n346\n00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:35.953\nYou can see it right here.\n\n347\n00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:40.767\nAnd I can cd into proc.\n\n348\n00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:45.369\nAnd you'll notice it's a bunch of numbers,\nprocess IDs.\n\n349\n00:16:45.369 --> 00:16:47.144\nThere are also some other things in there.\n\n350\n00:16:47.144 --> 00:16:48.677\nBut basically this is what we're doing.\n\n351\n00:16:48.677 --> 00:16:50.660\nWe're putting those process IDs in here.\n\n352\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.403\nWhen I'm done with the process\nthose files will go away.\n\n353\n00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:55.466\nThey disappear and it can be reused.\n\n354\n00:16:55.466 --> 00:16:59.073\nSo, very interesting if you wanna\ngo in here and take a look at it.\n\n355\n00:16:59.073 --> 00:17:00.100\nThere's really not a lot\nto do it with it here.\n\n356\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.766\nOther than it's needed by the system so\nthat you can handle the process and\n\n357\n00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:05.909\nthose stuff for our intents and purposes.\n\n358\n00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:09.335\nYou might be some super advanced\nLinux guru that can do cool stuff\n\n359\n00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:10.613\nwith the proc, right?\n\n360\n00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:11.268\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n361\n00:17:11.268 --> 00:17:14.692\nbasically the process ID becomes\na directory for that particular process.\n\n362\n00:17:14.692 --> 00:17:16.286\nSo there will be supporting files,\nwhatever it needs.\n\n363\n00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:16.937\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n364\n00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:17.515\nYou got it.\n\n365\n00:17:17.515 --> 00:17:18.092\n&gt;&gt; Temp files go in there.\n\n366\n00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:19.072\n&gt;&gt; Nailed it.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n367\n00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.746\n&gt;&gt; Mike's picking it up,\nhe's a Linux guru already.\n\n368\n00:17:20.746 --> 00:17:21.915\n&gt;&gt; You're a great instructor.\n\n369\n00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:22.902\n&gt;&gt; I try, I try.\n\n370\n00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:26.460\nThat's my goal, I want you guys\nto be brilliant at this stuff.\n\n371\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460\nI'm trying to do my best,\n\n372\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.670\nhopefully you guys are getting\na lot of stuff out of here.\n\n373\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.114\nAll right, let's talk about partitioning\nand operating a system installation.\n\n374\n00:17:33.114 --> 00:17:35.645\nSo we can move into doing an installation.\n\n375\n00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:38.732\nAnd Mike, yeah you're right,\nwe might run a little long.\n\n376\n00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:40.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I won't push it too far.\n\n377\n00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:40.733\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:43.648\n&gt;&gt; Let's get through this and\nwe'll start an installation, and\n\n379\n00:17:43.648 --> 00:17:46.528\nwe'll see what it's like to install Linux\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of funny,\n\n380\n00:17:46.528 --> 00:17:48.154\nwe're putting the cart before the horse.\n\n381\n00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:50.706\nWe talked about Linux before\nwe installed it but, hey,\n\n382\n00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:52.784\nthat's the way they\ngave me the objectives.\n\n383\n00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:53.404\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n384\n00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:54.752\n&gt;&gt; So what are you gonna do, right?\n\n385\n00:17:54.752 --> 00:17:57.260\n&gt;&gt; It built up the suspense,\nnow I'm dying to see you get it installed.\n\n386\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've gotta install\nthis Linux operating system, man,\n\n387\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.266\nI can't live without it.\n\n388\n00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:02.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's see here.\n\n389\n00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:06.430\nLet's talk about partitions,\n\n390\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.443\na typical partitioning scheme.\n\n391\n00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:14.261\nUsually, if you're just\ndoing some installation for\n\n392\n00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:16.419\nmaybe a desktop, an install.\n\n393\n00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:19.452\nYou're just gonna blow\nthe whole drive away,\n\n394\n00:18:19.452 --> 00:18:23.044\ninstall the operating system\non one large partition.\n\n395\n00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:25.182\nAnd you're done,\nthere's your installation.\n\n396\n00:18:25.182 --> 00:18:28.879\nThat's one way to go, and it's a good way\nto go, especially for something like that.\n\n397\n00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:33.939\nYou also might see very typically\nwhere you have, like I said before.\n\n398\n00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:37.702\nWhere you have partitioned off for\nthe installation,\n\n399\n00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:41.235\nyou've also partitioned\none of the mount points.\n\n400\n00:18:41.235 --> 00:18:44.611\nOr not mount points but\nthe slash boot directory.\n\n401\n00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.049\nThat's what I was looking for, directory.\n\n402\n00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:48.175\nYou might want to partition that off for\n\n403\n00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:52.438\nreasons such as if it ever becomes\ncorrupted then my whole system isn't dead.\n\n404\n00:18:52.438 --> 00:18:53.422\nI just have to rebuild that.\n\n405\n00:18:53.422 --> 00:18:56.659\nI can unmount it,\nreinstall the files there,\n\n406\n00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:01.065\ndrop them back in, remount it and\nI might be back into the game.\n\n407\n00:19:01.065 --> 00:19:02.716\nThat's a good thing, that's what we want.\n\n408\n00:19:02.716 --> 00:19:05.532\nAll my other files are not corrupted,\nnecessarily.\n\n409\n00:19:05.532 --> 00:19:06.082\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n410\n00:19:06.082 --> 00:19:10.125\nagain I like to go back to the Windows\nanalogy since I'm from the Windows side.\n\n411\n00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:14.542\nSo it'd be like me say,\nhaving two drives in my Windows system.\n\n412\n00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:19.517\nPutting my operating system on C: and then\nredirecting my documents, my pictures,\n\n413\n00:19:19.517 --> 00:19:21.255\nand all of that to the D drive.\n\n414\n00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:24.328\nAnd that way if the operating\nsystem ever crashes, I reinstall.\n\n415\n00:19:24.328 --> 00:19:27.000\nI don't even have to worry\nabout recovering data first, or\n\n416\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.070\nanything like that.\n\n417\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.698\nI just re-point it once I reinstall and\nwe're good to go.\n\n418\n00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:31.509\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you were an honor roll student,\nweren't you?\n\n419\n00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:32.093\nI can tell.\n\n420\n00:19:32.093 --> 00:19:33.806\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can look at him and just say, hey,\n\n421\n00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:34.700\nthis kid pays attention.\n\n422\n00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.760\nCuz he's right, it's exactly\nwhat you're thinking of doing.\n\n423\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.991\nSeparating and segregating your drives\ninto multiple partitions is done for\n\n424\n00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.138\nsafety purposes, right?\n\n425\n00:19:42.138 --> 00:19:47.494\nSo that if I lose one partition\nI didn't lose the others, right?\n\n426\n00:19:47.494 --> 00:19:52.756\nOr if I've infected one partition,\nnot necessarily have infected the others.\n\n427\n00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:56.115\nI've done some safety bounding\naround those areas, so\n\n428\n00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:58.050\nthat's a really good way to go.\n\n429\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:02.050\nAnother partition you might usually see\nis what's called the swap partition.\n\n430\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.860\nAnd, hopefully, swap makes sense to you.\n\n431\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.840\nMaybe the word page file, or\n\n432\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.820\npaging, might be more in line with\nsomething you've heard before.\n\n433\n00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.080\nSo basically, you're taking a chunk of\nthe hard drive and segregating it off.\n\n434\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.360\nSo that you can augment your RAM, right?\n\n435\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.310\nSo maybe you don't have the greatest\nRAM system in the world.\n\n436\n00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.230\nYou're running with a 512 megabyte for\nwhatever strange reason.\n\n437\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.390\nRAM is cheap.\nGo buy more, please, all right?\n\n438\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.130\nThis was typical more because RAM\nused to didn't be so cheap, right?\n\n439\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.346\nSystems of RAM was very expensive and\nto have a lot of RAM was a luxury.\n\n440\n00:20:36.346 --> 00:20:40.681\nHard drive space, on the other hand, has\ntypically always been relatively cheap.\n\n441\n00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:42.232\nSo what they did was say, well,\n\n442\n00:20:42.232 --> 00:20:45.520\nwe'll use some of the hard\ndrive space to augment our RAM.\n\n443\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.190\nEven though we can buy [INAUDIBLE]\nof RAM pretty cheaply now,\n\n444\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.560\npeople still tend to use that swap space.\n\n445\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.710\nBecause you never know,\nyou could eat up all your RAM.\n\n446\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:00.580\nAnd having a bit of swap space and storage\nis still relatively cheap, so why not?\n\n447\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.800\nGive it a couple of gigs.\n\n448\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.150\nTypically what I have,\nif I'm remembering correctly,\n\n449\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.850\nmost people and the-\n&gt;&gt; Recommendation.\n\n450\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.455\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.\nRecommendation is to if,\n\n451\n00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:14.676\nyou've got two gigs of RAM, give\nyourself two gigs of swap space, right?\n\n452\n00:21:14.676 --> 00:21:15.245\nThat kind of thing.\n\n453\n00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:17.827\nIt's like a 401K, right?\n\n454\n00:21:17.827 --> 00:21:20.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have matching going on.\n\n455\n00:21:20.598 --> 00:21:22.173\n&gt;&gt; NIce.\n&gt;&gt; That's the way to think about it.\n\n456\n00:21:22.173 --> 00:21:26.342\nAll right, the other thing we\nwanna talk about is GPT and MBR.\n\n457\n00:21:26.342 --> 00:21:29.523\nThese are the file system\ntypes that you can work with.\n\n458\n00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:31.539\nMBR is the tried and true.\n\n459\n00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:34.105\nIt's the Master Boot Record\nfile system type.\n\n460\n00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:36.177\nIt does a great job.\n\n461\n00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:37.131\nYou can still use it today.\n\n462\n00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:40.412\nThere is a reason it's so\nlong in the tooth, cuz it works very well.\n\n463\n00:21:40.412 --> 00:21:42.135\nIt supports up to two terabyte drives.\n\n464\n00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.846\nAnd actually if I'm not wrong\nthere's a way to hack around it.\n\n465\n00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.783\nAnd, you can get it to do\nsomething like 16 terabytes.\n\n466\n00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:54.782\nBut typically you're probably gonna see on\na test question, how much does it support?\n\n467\n00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:56.075\nIt's gonna be two terabytes in size.\n\n468\n00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:00.962\nIt's great stuff.\nIf you're just doing a base install at\n\n469\n00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:04.697\nhome, trying to play with Linux, trying\nto learn about Linux, go MBR, it's fine.\n\n470\n00:22:04.697 --> 00:22:09.436\nNow if you have a UEFI system,\nright, that's the newer type of, for\n\n471\n00:22:09.436 --> 00:22:11.910\nlack of a better term BIOS, right?\n\n472\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.780\nAll BIOS systems work great.\n\n473\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.660\nThey work great with MBR.\n\n474\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.101\nMBR does support some UEFI systems.\n\n475\n00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:20.013\nBut not all but\n\n476\n00:22:20.013 --> 00:22:25.031\nif you have a UEFI system you might want\nto go with GPT because GPT is supported.\n\n477\n00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:27.941\nIt's built for UEFI systems, okay?\n\n478\n00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:31.023\nSo it'll give you all the bells and\nwhistles of the UEFI, and\n\n479\n00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:33.088\nit's a much better butter, all right?\n\n480\n00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:33.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n481\n00:22:33.748 --> 00:22:37.738\nwhen we talk about support for\nlarge file systems and partitions,\n\n482\n00:22:37.738 --> 00:22:41.455\nthe sky's the the limit,\nbasically, to be honest with you.\n\n483\n00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:48.096\nTwo terabytes and above is easy\ndepending on the operating system and\n\n484\n00:22:48.096 --> 00:22:52.640\nhow much drive space you have, really.\n\n485\n00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.670\nThat is no joke.\n\n486\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.217\nThe sky is the limit.\n\n487\n00:22:54.217 --> 00:22:56.263\nIf the operating system supports it and\n\n488\n00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:59.363\nyou have enough money to keep\nthrowing drives inside of it.\n\n489\n00:22:59.363 --> 00:23:02.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It will continue to give you partitions\n\n490\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.253\ntil the day is long.\n\n491\n00:23:03.253 --> 00:23:04.360\nYou can have unlimited partitions.\n\n492\n00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.310\nMBR, it does partitioning of\nfour primary partitions or\n\n493\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.440\nthree primary partitions and\none extended partition.\n\n494\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.480\nSo that you can get that logical\nvoluming out where we have A, B, C,\n\n495\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.980\nD, and E, all of that.\n\n496\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.823\nBut still, limitations there, right?\n\n497\n00:23:18.823 --> 00:23:23.419\nWhy not just have as many partitions as\nyou'd like as long as you've got the drive\n\n498\n00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:25.390\nspace and the money to chuck at it?\n\n499\n00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.702\nSo that's GPT.\n\n500\n00:23:26.702 --> 00:23:30.908\nThere are so many advantages to\nGPT over MBR in the long run,\n\n501\n00:23:30.908 --> 00:23:34.963\nespecially for big,\nbig budgets and big environments.\n\n502\n00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:37.837\nThat GPT is typically gonna\nbe the way you wanna go.\n\n503\n00:23:37.837 --> 00:23:39.829\nBut if you want to do MBR,\nthat's fine right now,\n\n504\n00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:43.740\nespecially if you're just doing that\nbase install trying to play with Linux.\n\n505\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.664\nAll right. Let's see here. What else\ndo I want to teach you guys about that?\n\n506\n00:23:46.664 --> 00:23:50.217\nNothing, right, we've basically given you\nall the foundational knowledge you need.\n\n507\n00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:52.342\nNow we're gonna do it.\n\n508\n00:23:52.342 --> 00:23:53.306\nWe're gonna do it.\n\n509\n00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:54.034\nWe got this.\n\n510\n00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:57.367\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna install Linux Right now, so\n\n511\n00:23:57.367 --> 00:24:02.340\nlet me close this out here and\njump over to my Mac OS.\n\n512\n00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.500\nAnd, bring this library up,\nI'm gonna start a system.\n\n513\n00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.518\nAgain, I'm using virtualization so\nI can show you this.\n\n514\n00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:13.275\nBut typically, you download\nthe ISO from Ubuntu or Fedora, or\n\n515\n00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:18.389\nwhatever it is your distro is,\nslap it on there, make it bootable,\n\n516\n00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:22.273\nplug it in and\nboot your system to that thumb drive.\n\n517\n00:24:22.273 --> 00:24:24.980\nIf you're really old you've got it\non a DVD or something like that,\n\n518\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.372\nwhich I still have too, so don't feel bad\nabout that if you're still rocking that.\n\n519\n00:24:28.372 --> 00:24:33.470\nI am gonna start our Ubuntu install and\nget it cranking here.\n\n520\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.830\nYou'll have to forgive the fact that\nthis isn't going to be as TV friendly as\n\n521\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:42.320\nmy collie is because it's unconfigured,\nit's gonna be very basic.\n\n522\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.074\nSo, we're gonna get this rocking.\n\n523\n00:24:44.074 --> 00:24:45.090\nWe see it rolling.\n\n524\n00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.120\nLook at this lovely, nice,\ngraphical installation.\n\n525\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.963\nWe love graphics, right?\n\n526\n00:24:48.963 --> 00:24:49.605\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n527\n00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n528\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.320\nDrum roll please.\n\n529\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.150\nCome on system, you can do this.\n\n530\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.345\nThere we go.\nAnd now we're starting to see\n\n531\n00:24:55.345 --> 00:24:56.650\ninitialization of the system.\n\n532\n00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.450\nThis is typical to a Linux installation\nof any ilk to be honest with you.\n\n533\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.960\nIt starts running the base installer and\nit kinda\n\n534\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.030\ngives you maybe like a splash page like\nthis to wait it out until that gets done.\n\n535\n00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.270\nOnce that gets done,\n\n536\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.310\nit's gonna jump to the installation\nportion like what we're doing right here.\n\n537\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.790\nAnd you'll notice in here,\nI've got a nice, lovely graphic.\n\n538\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.290\nMost installs today will have\na graphical environment.\n\n539\n00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.950\nBut there are exceptions to every rule,\nobviously.\n\n540\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.803\nThe cool thing about Ubuntu here\nis you'll see this try Ubuntu.\n\n541\n00:25:27.803 --> 00:25:31.687\nYou can basically run it like a live\nCD right off your thumb drive, so\n\n542\n00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:32.854\nyou can test it out.\n\n543\n00:25:32.854 --> 00:25:36.855\nYou don't have to do any installation, you\njust hit try, launches you to the desktop,\n\n544\n00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:39.580\nand runs from the drive and\ndoes this dynamically, right?\n\n545\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.422\nSo, once you shut down a system and\npull it out, it's like it was never there.\n\n546\n00:25:43.422 --> 00:25:47.098\nIt's not gonna save files or anything\nlike that, its just gonna allow you to\n\n547\n00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:50.317\nwork around the operating system,\nplay with it, run programs and\n\n548\n00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:53.902\nthings of that nature that are pre-done\nfor you to test drive the system.\n\n549\n00:25:53.902 --> 00:25:57.064\nBut we wanna install Ubuntu,\nI've already test drive, I know I like it,\n\n550\n00:25:57.064 --> 00:25:58.370\nI want it, right?\n\n551\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.520\nLet's do this.\n\n552\n00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520\nInstall.\n\n553\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.328\nYou'll notice also that it's asking me for\na language,\n\n554\n00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:06.152\nprobably a good idea to choose\none that you are fluent in.\n\n555\n00:26:06.152 --> 00:26:08.450\n[LAUGH] All right so, here we go.\n\n556\n00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.600\nPreparing to install Ubuntu.\n\n557\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.150\nIt's telling me some things\nthat I might wanna be aware of,\n\n558\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.340\nthat I might need to know.\n\n559\n00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.060\nI need at least 6.6\ngigabytes on the drive so\n\n560\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.120\nthat I can install the operation system.\n\n561\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.550\nGood news is I've made this a ten\ngigabyte drive so I should be good to go.\n\n562\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.210\nAnd you'll notice I get a nice little\ngreen check mark letting me know that\n\n563\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.770\nthat is a fact.\n\n564\n00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.150\nIt also lets me know that I'm\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n565\n00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.410\nThat means, right?\n\n566\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.840\nWe're getting good news here.\n\n567\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.850\nThe good news is it found my adapter,\nand it had a driver for it.\n\n568\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.890\nAnd it was able to contact\nthe Internet and do a test, and\n\n569\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.260\nI have Internet capabilities.\n\n570\n00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.640\nThat's a thumbs up right there.\n\n571\n00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.780\nOne of the reasons a lot of people\nlike Ubuntu is because it has so\n\n572\n00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.399\nmany drivers and\nsupports so much hardware.\n\n573\n00:26:49.498 --> 00:26:52.560\nAlso it allow me to download\nupdates while installing, so\n\n574\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.110\nI can do the talking security here.\n\n575\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.070\nGood option.\n\n576\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.350\nIt's a fantastic option, right,\ncuz you want the system to be\n\n577\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:03.280\nas up to date as possible as soon\nas it touches the Internet, right?\n\n578\n00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.950\nAnd with any kind of\nimportant thing on it.\n\n579\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.085\nSo before I start slapping\nproduction stuff on this system,\n\n580\n00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:10.811\nI would want this thing updated.\n\n581\n00:27:10.811 --> 00:27:13.114\nI'm gonna leave this off because\nwe're gonna do updates and\n\n582\n00:27:13.114 --> 00:27:15.734\nit would take forever because it's\ngonna have to download them, and\n\n583\n00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:18.370\nthen install them, while we're\ninstalling the operating system.\n\n584\n00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.696\nSo if you take that option,\nit's gonna be a little bit longer but\n\n585\n00:27:21.696 --> 00:27:23.860\nthat's why we're gonna stave that off.\n\n586\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.870\nNormally though, I would say definitely\ndo this, and just bite the bullet and\n\n587\n00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.104\nwait the time it takes.\n\n588\n00:27:29.104 --> 00:27:32.506\nYou can also use third party, if you\nwant to install third party software,\n\n589\n00:27:32.506 --> 00:27:35.210\nit's letting you know what that is,\nthe option's there.\n\n590\n00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.540\nBut I'm just gonna go with\na regular install and hit continue.\n\n591\n00:27:39.499 --> 00:27:41.920\nAll right, partitioning time, hello.\n\n592\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.740\nThis is the fun part.\n\n593\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.610\nYou'll notice that the primary\noption is to what?\n\n594\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.020\nErase the entire disc and\ninstall Ubuntu ,right?\n\n595\n00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.670\nTypically, that's probably\nwhat you're going to do.\n\n596\n00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.410\nIf I wanted to be, I've got a purchasing\nscheme that I wanna go with, well,\n\n597\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.100\nthat's not it.\n\n598\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.520\nI just want the root and one partition.\n\n599\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.220\nI wanna install more partitions.\n\n600\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.750\nI can do something else, right?\n\n601\n00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.510\nAnd I hit continue.\n\n602\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.528\nAnd this takes me here to the partitioning\nsoftware inside of the installer.\n\n603\n00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:12.520\nAnd I can do an new partition table.\n\n604\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.980\nIt's gonna warn me that, hey,\n\n605\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.240\nbuddy, you're messing around\nwith the partition table.\n\n606\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.490\nYou sure you wanna do that?\n\n607\n00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.790\nYou got the way with all.\n\n608\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.600\nYeah, I think, I'm good to go.\n\n609\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.430\nAnd then, I can say, okay, there's\nfree space and I can add a partition,\n\n610\n00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.680\nchange the size so\nif I want this to be, ooh, hello.\n\n611\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.620\nSo, maybe like a gigs, not 800.\n\n612\n00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.040\nPrimary or logical?\n\n613\n00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.460\nI can create this.\n\n614\n00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.880\nIt's not allowing me to\nchange the file type,\n\n615\n00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.790\nso our file system types,\nI can't do mbr versus gpt.\n\n616\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.090\nI would have to convert one way or\nthe other.\n\n617\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.830\nI think the default here in\nthis installation is MBR.\n\n618\n00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.790\nI think that's what it is.\n\n619\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.150\nI can't swear to it.\n\n620\n00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.210\nBut I would have to convert it one way or\n\n621\n00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.950\nthe other if I wanted to change it later,\nwhich you can do.\n\n622\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.040\nFantastic thing about Linux, right?\n\n623\n00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.430\nSo I'm gonna make this a primary.\n\n624\n00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.158\nAsk me where I want the partition to be.\n\n625\n00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:05.620\nDo I wanna be the beginning of the disk,\nor the end of the disk?\n\n626\n00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.640\nWhere do you wanna put it?\n\n627\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.820\nAnd you might wanna shuffle it around.\n\n628\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.448\nJust depending on where\nyour free space is.\n\n629\n00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:13.010\nBut I'm leaving it at the beginning.\n\n630\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.290\nI'll leave this as the Ext4\njournaling file system.\n\n631\n00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.560\nIt's one of the better file systems for,\nand\n\n632\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.620\nmore commonly used inside of Linux,\nit's a great file system.\n\n633\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.220\nAnd then the mount point is asking\nme what do I wanna put here?\n\n634\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.590\nAnd well, I'm gonna put the root, right?\n\n635\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.550\nThis is gonna be the root of the drive.\n\n636\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.430\nIt's gonna be basically all that file\nsystem that we saw over in the box,\n\n637\n00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.390\nwhen I did the LS at the root system.\n\n638\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.560\nAll that stuff's gonna\nget installed right here.\n\n639\n00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.980\nI hit okay.\nAnd then I can add another one.\n\n640\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.950\nI hit the free space first, maybe.\n\n641\n00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.130\nAnd another one,\nI can take some more space outta here.\n\n642\n00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:54.088\nAnd maybe we'll take a gig, roughly and\nwe'll call it another primary.\n\n643\n00:29:54.088 --> 00:29:56.460\nAnd we'll make that mount point the boot,\nright?\n\n644\n00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.750\nSave those files.\n\n645\n00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.730\nNow we're starting to segregate.\n\n646\n00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.440\nAnd hit okay.\n\n647\n00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.720\nAnd then, I'll do one more for greens.\n\n648\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.410\nWe'll take the rest of it, make it primary\nand this time I wanna change this system.\n\n649\n00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.500\nDown to swap, all right?\n\n650\n00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.350\nMake some swap space for myself.\n\n651\n00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.180\nSo, basically what I talked about before.\n\n652\n00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.200\nI had typical,\n\n653\n00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.590\nyou'll see this kind of partitioning\nscheme very often when installing Linux.\n\n654\n00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.990\nI'll say, okay.\n\n655\n00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.770\nSo, if I liked this, my entire disk is now\npartitioned out with the different things.\n\n656\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:31.940\nIf I like this, I'll be good to go.\n\n657\n00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.540\nI can install now.\n\n658\n00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.750\nI'm just gonna go with the default\nbecause I wanna keep this quick.\n\n659\n00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.220\nI don't wanna have to deal through\nthree formats and all that.\n\n660\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.578\nI'm just gonna revert this all back.\n\n661\n00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:45.219\nBut typically, if my partitioning scheme\nis all laid out like I like, I look at it,\n\n662\n00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:46.110\nI see it looks good.\n\n663\n00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.340\nI would hit Install now.\n\n664\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.600\nI'm just gonna revert and go back so\n\n665\n00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.270\nI can just erase the entire disc and\ninstall Ubuntu.\n\n666\n00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.670\nI do wanna talk about this really quickly.\n\n667\n00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.800\nEncrypt the Ubuntu installation for\nsecurity.\n\n668\n00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.950\nGood idea, good idea.\n\n669\n00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.760\nYou just create yourself\na security key and\n\n670\n00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.820\nthe next step follows the steps,\nand you have an encrypted disk.\n\n671\n00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.650\nWell hey, if someone steals your stuff.\n\n672\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.660\nThey're not gonna get it,\nit's encrypted, right?\n\n673\n00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.720\nIt's good stuff.\n\n674\n00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.220\nAlso use LVM, LVM is also a very good\nthing, it's the logical volume manager,\n\n675\n00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:19.240\nit's the way to do disk management\ninside of Linux systems.\n\n676\n00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.710\nYou don't have to worry about as far\nas your exam goes, it is good for\n\n677\n00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.620\nyou to go out and\nlearn a little bit about.\n\n678\n00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.280\nWe're just gonna leave that off for\nright now, okay?\n\n679\n00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.940\nI hit install now and it's gonna say,\ndo you wanna do all of this?\n\n680\n00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.670\nAre you sure?\n\n681\n00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.970\nYes I am sure,\nlet's continue and off we go.\n\n682\n00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.369\nAnd it's gonna turn and this, then give me\na couple more questions, where am I at,\n\n683\n00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:42.550\nsince it's trying to get\nthat time zone thing.\n\n684\n00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.260\nTime is extremely\nimportant with computers,\n\n685\n00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.360\nso you wanna make sure you\nclick your correct time zone.\n\n686\n00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.196\nThat is the correct one for\nme, I'll hit continue.\n\n687\n00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:54.138\nThen we got again what is your keyboard\nkinda going along with your language\n\n688\n00:31:54.138 --> 00:31:56.085\nAgain, choose something you like.\n\n689\n00:31:56.085 --> 00:32:00.087\nAnd also forgive me again,\nsince we have yet to get fully installed,\n\n690\n00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:02.710\nour resolution isn't beautiful quite yet.\n\n691\n00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.780\nWe'll fix that just momentarily.\n\n692\n00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.640\nContinue, cuz I speak English.\n\n693\n00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.100\nThis portion is create a user.\n\n694\n00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.040\nWho are you?\n\n695\n00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.470\nBasically, we need an administrative user.\n\n696\n00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:17.275\nTypically not a good idea,\nI've said this before to log in as roots.\n\n697\n00:32:17.275 --> 00:32:20.855\nSo you wanna create at least one super\nuser that you'll log in as instead of\n\n698\n00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:24.930\nroots that you can elevate your\nprivileges, we'll talk about that later.\n\n699\n00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:29.572\nSo I'll go ahead and create myself,\nI'll pick a username,\n\n700\n00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:35.229\nI like the old initial last name\nnomenclature, I'll give it a password.\n\n701\n00:32:35.229 --> 00:32:40.124\nI think I totally\nfat-fingered that password.\n\n702\n00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.486\nThere we go.\n\n703\n00:32:42.486 --> 00:32:43.650\nIt's a fair password.\n\n704\n00:32:47.392 --> 00:32:49.110\nAnd it is good.\n\n705\n00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.710\nI don't like log in automatically,\nsecurity reasons, that's not a good idea.\n\n706\n00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.210\nAnd you'll notice the default\nis require my password.\n\n707\n00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.500\nYou can also encrypt your home folder but\nif we did file encryption before,\n\n708\n00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.430\nyou should be good to go.\n\n709\n00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.980\nBut if you didn't, I can do it here and\njust get my own home folder, right.\n\n710\n00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.300\nSo, could be a good way to go.\n\n711\n00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.550\nI am going to change this computer's\nname cuz this is just ridiculous.\n\n712\n00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here,\n\n713\n00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.030\nlet's make it just Ubuntu.\n\n714\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.930\nUbuntu, like that.\n\n715\n00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.250\nOkay, how about ubuntulab?\n\n716\n00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:20.840\nThere we go, cool.\n\n717\n00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:23.800\nAnd now I will hit Continue.\n\n718\n00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.750\nSo now I've got a user,\n\n719\n00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.740\nit's got superuser privileges,\ninstallation is now up and running.\n\n720\n00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.460\nI timed this before,\nonly takes like two minutes.\n\n721\n00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n722\n00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.000\nAnd in even like hits the Internet and\neverything, it's a quick installation.\n\n723\n00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.482\nIt's all good to go.\n\n724\n00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:42.452\nI want to jump over and quickly we'll\nstart a CentOS, just so we can see\n\n725\n00:33:42.452 --> 00:33:48.540\nthe difference between a Red Hat variant\nversus a Debian Ubuntu type system.\n\n726\n00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.680\nAnd that will probably be done very,\nvery shortly.\n\n727\n00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.150\nSo I'm gonna start the CentOS and\nstart up.\n\n728\n00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.800\nLook at some of the similarities and\ndifferences between the two.\n\n729\n00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.910\nNotices that quite as\nfancy dansy as of yet.\n\n730\n00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.455\nWe've got people here trying to.\n\n731\n00:34:04.455 --> 00:34:05.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Get on my nerve.\n\n732\n00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm gonna hit\nReturn to start the installation.\n\n733\n00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.990\nGonna tell me that again, hit Return.\n\n734\n00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:11.570\nIt still look more graphically based.\n\n735\n00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.365\nThis is a little more no nonsense, right?\n\n736\n00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:16.590\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; No monkey business,\n\n737\n00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.840\nlet's get down to it.\n\n738\n00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.310\nI'm only gonna give you\nwhat you need to see.\n\n739\n00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.610\nThere is a lovely little GUI environment\nthat does jump up here in just a second.\n\n740\n00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:28.730\nAnd it looks identical to\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, right.\n\n741\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.020\nSo if you play around with CentOS,\n\n742\n00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.260\nyou'll be very well-equipped to\nwork in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n743\n00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:40.150\nAlmost identical in every way shape and\nform, because it's supposed to be.\n\n744\n00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.670\nIt's what's kind of meant to be,\nthe free version of Red Hat Enterprise.\n\n745\n00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.810\nHere comes our GUI.\n\n746\n00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.910\nLet's check on our other guy.\n\n747\n00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:51.480\nYeah, almost done, getting there.\n\n748\n00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.470\nHere we are looking for.\n\n749\n00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:55.230\nI'm gonna quickly jump through these for\nus.\n\n750\n00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.450\nLooking for a language,\nI do speak English.\n\n751\n00:35:00.008 --> 00:35:01.990\nAnd give me what date and time.\n\n752\n00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.840\nIt's already got the New York timezone,\nso I'm good.\n\n753\n00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.410\nKeyboard, English-US, I'm good there.\n\n754\n00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.460\nLanguage support, English United States.\n\n755\n00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.580\nSo similar things that we saw\nin the Ubuntu installation.\n\n756\n00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.000\nInstallation media source,\nit's on local media.\n\n757\n00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.637\nSoftware selection, this is a good\none you probably wanna jump into.\n\n758\n00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:20.270\nWe've got minimal installation.\n\n759\n00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.690\nIf I'm doing a headless server and\n\n760\n00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.240\nI want it clean as a whistle,\nthat's the guy I wanna go with.\n\n761\n00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.340\nAnd it's gonna be our fastest installation\nand then we can build upon it.\n\n762\n00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.120\nIf you know this is gonna be something\nlike a file and print server or\n\n763\n00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.330\na basic web server,\nyou can go ahead and select those.\n\n764\n00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:39.119\nYou'll see I think down at the bottom,\nthere is yeah, like desktop, right?\n\n765\n00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:43.460\nSo if you want this to be a desktop not\na server, you can choose that option.\n\n766\n00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.290\nSo very, very nice few options and then\nyou can come over here and make sure you\n\n767\n00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.270\nselect all the correct software and\ntools that you want for your installation.\n\n768\n00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.100\nOnce you have done with that,\nyou hit Done.\n\n769\n00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.820\nAnd then scroll down.\n\n770\n00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.960\nAnd again, look, partitioning.\n\n771\n00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.990\nIt's telling you that it's already\nselected automatic partitioning.\n\n772\n00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.693\nIt would have its own variation of the\npartitioning tool that we saw in Ubuntu.\n\n773\n00:36:05.693 --> 00:36:09.340\nWhich you could change if you wanted to\ndo your own custom partitioning scheme.\n\n774\n00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.140\nAgain, I'm going with that automatic.\n\n775\n00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:16.460\nYou do have to actually select it here and\nsay yes, I do wanna do that, I'm done.\n\n776\n00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.491\nAnd now you know it\ntakes its warning away.\n\n777\n00:36:18.491 --> 00:36:20.648\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because I saw that it showed\n\n778\n00:36:20.648 --> 00:36:24.359\nme something, I looked at it,\nI agreed to it, I hit Done and\n\n779\n00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:28.180\nnow and\nthat's a nice feature from CentOS here.\n\n780\n00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.160\nAlso network and\nhost name is not connected here.\n\n781\n00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.630\nSo maybe it didn't find a driver or\nwhatever for my adapter.\n\n782\n00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.290\nMight have to cross that bridge, right?\n\n783\n00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.500\nSo just keep that in mind in installation.\n\n784\n00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.890\nKdump, this is all about reporting, so\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n785\n00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.020\nI'll just begin that installation.\n\n786\n00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:50.170\nLooking for a root password and\nuser creation that we can do before,\n\n787\n00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.480\njust like what we saw on Ubuntu.\n\n788\n00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.506\nI'm not gonna worry about that because\nlook at that, we're done here, we'll\n\n789\n00:36:55.506 --> 00:37:00.035\nrestart, let that restart, we go back over\nthis installation, let this well and good.\n\n790\n00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:03.350\nLet's go and set that root password\ncuz that's very important.\n\n791\n00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.800\nDon't forget to set your root\npassword ladies and gentlemen.\n\n792\n00:37:10.423 --> 00:37:11.478\nThere we go, nice and strong.\n\n793\n00:37:11.478 --> 00:37:12.748\n&gt;&gt; That one is a little more strong.\n\n794\n00:37:12.748 --> 00:37:17.279\n&gt;&gt; I hope I've typed this correctly.\n\n795\n00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:19.607\nThe passwords do not match,\ncuz I'm a horrible typer, that's why.\n\n796\n00:37:19.607 --> 00:37:21.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n797\n00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:26.310\nPasswords do not match.\n\n798\n00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.100\nI can't type my own password,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n799\n00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.008\nIt's a bit of a bear.\n\n800\n00:37:29.008 --> 00:37:30.221\n&gt;&gt; The first one's a character short.\n\n801\n00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:31.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe that's it, maybe that's it.\n\n802\n00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:32.485\nLet's try this.\n\n803\n00:37:37.452 --> 00:37:40.940\n[LAUGH] Now I got me gun shy, there we go.\n\n804\n00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.750\nI can type a password.\n\n805\n00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.510\nAnd I'll just create that user full name.\n\n806\n00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.730\nAnd look at it, dlowrie, just like I like.\n\n807\n00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.355\nMake me an administrator,\ngive it a password.\n\n808\n00:37:55.788 --> 00:38:00.840\nAnd they say that my\npassword here is strong.\n\n809\n00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.815\nWhere Ubuntu said,\nit's okay [CROSSTALK], yeah.\n\n810\n00:38:03.815 --> 00:38:06.780\nAll right, so I'm done with that.\n\n811\n00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.860\nSo this is almost done.\n\n812\n00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.320\nLooks like we're firing back up over here.\n\n813\n00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.660\nBlank screen.\n\n814\n00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.190\nGo back over here.\n\n815\n00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.245\nAt least I have something to look at.\n\n816\n00:38:14.245 --> 00:38:15.415\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n817\n00:38:15.415 --> 00:38:16.760\nStill pretty darn quick.\n\n818\n00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely faster than any Windows\n\n819\n00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.570\ninstallation that I have done.\n\n820\n00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.220\n&gt;&gt; We got right through it.\n\n821\n00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.612\nIt took us maybe 10 minutes or\nso to crank through this.\n\n822\n00:38:24.612 --> 00:38:26.765\nBasically we're waiting for\nthe op, you know what it is?\n\n823\n00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:29.990\nIt's the stupid reboot in\nthese virtual machines.\n\n824\n00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.610\nSometimes they hang,\nyes, restart that guy.\n\n825\n00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.280\nThat's the problem,\nshould have known that.\n\n826\n00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.970\nIt's a little long episode guys, but\nit's worth the wait just to see.\n\n827\n00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:47.370\nOkay, now we're starting to launch and\nthis will take us to our login page.\n\n828\n00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.740\nThe operating system itself is installed,\nlook at that.\n\n829\n00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.062\nI'm at the login prompt,\nI type in my password.\n\n830\n00:38:57.584 --> 00:38:59.350\nBada bing!\n\n831\n00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.172\nHere it comes, it's starting to load.\n\n832\n00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:05.171\nFirst time loading usually computer take\na minute when it's your first login.\n\n833\n00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:07.810\nLet's see where CentOS is at.\n\n834\n00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.565\nStill cranking through it,\nwe won't worry about that too much.\n\n835\n00:39:10.565 --> 00:39:13.410\nThere we go,\nthere's a desktop now I can go in and\n\n836\n00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.980\nbeautify this a little bit\nI go to System Settings.\n\n837\n00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.740\nAnd maybe displays and change to\nsomething a little more ITProTV friendly.\n\n838\n00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.227\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So where is 16:9.\n\n839\n00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.030\nThere is a good one.\n\n840\n00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.730\nLet's do that.\n\n841\n00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.806\n[INAUDIBLE] This over here, Apply and yes.\n\n842\n00:39:28.806 --> 00:39:30.710\nWe will keep this configuration.\n\n843\n00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.558\nLook at that.\nLooks beautiful.\n\n844\n00:39:32.558 --> 00:39:35.470\n[INAUDIBLE], I can start a terminal.\n\n845\n00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.130\nHere we go.\n\n846\n00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.050\nGive me a terminal.\n\n847\n00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.430\nWe know it, we love it,\nit is a fantastic thing.\n\n848\n00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:47.433\nI can do my ps-ax,\nall commands we know and love.\n\n849\n00:39:47.433 --> 00:39:51.140\nI am now a Linux user,\nI've got Linux installed.\n\n850\n00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.100\nHopefully that was relatively painless for\nyou.\n\n851\n00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.250\nEverything seemed intuitive.\n\n852\n00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.600\nThey've done a lot of very good\nthings with the installation.\n\n853\n00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.710\nIt used to be very hard\nto get Linux installed.\n\n854\n00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:01.660\nThat is no longer the case.\n\n855\n00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.670\nSomething like Ubuntu, you saw how easy it\nwas and it should be that easy for you.\n\n856\n00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.980\nMike, that's about all I got about for\nour overview.\n\n857\n00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.693\nI think I've taken us from soup to nuts.\n\n858\n00:40:09.693 --> 00:40:10.365\nHopefully, that's it.\n\n859\n00:40:10.365 --> 00:40:11.498\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n860\n00:40:11.498 --> 00:40:15.568\nThat was an impressive episode,\nreally demystified the file system and\n\n861\n00:40:15.568 --> 00:40:17.780\nthen being able to get that installed.\n\n862\n00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.732\nCuz I mean I know years ago, like you\nsaid, it's really what kept me from\n\n863\n00:40:21.732 --> 00:40:26.150\nkind of playing with Linux a little more,\nwas it was difficult to get it installed.\n\n864\n00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.230\nAnd I played around with live distros,\nbut now with all the GUI interfaces,\n\n865\n00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.930\n[INAUDIBLE] and all this,\nthe GUI installations.\n\n866\n00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.770\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n867\n00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.480\nIt's fun operating\nsystems [INAUDIBLE] with.\n\n868\n00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.370\nAnd it's definitely got its place.\n\n869\n00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.760\nIf you're gonna be a security guy or gal,\n\n870\n00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.580\nyou've gotta understand this cuz you\nare gonna run into Linux systems.\n\n871\n00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.230\nWhether that's your end users using it,\nwhether that's servers in the server\n\n872\n00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:51.630\ncloset that are running it, you're gonna\nhave to deal with Linux at some point.\n\n873\n00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.820\nSo it's important that we understand\nthat we can't just be a Windows person.\n\n874\n00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.430\nWe've gotta be able to run all these\ndifferent operating systems and\n\n875\n00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.980\nsecurity and\nthings are gonna be a little different.\n\n876\n00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.340\nSo again, thank you for getting us\nstarted down this road in Linux.\n\n877\n00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.720\nI know we've got a little\nbit further to go,\n\n878\n00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.030\nwe'll do that in another episode,\nthis one is done.\n\n879\n00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.080\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n880\n00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n881\n00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.098\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n882\n00:41:13.098 --> 00:41:20.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n883\n00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:23.146\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:05.960\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.396\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:12.500\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.955\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:20.460\nI\"m your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our GIAC security essentials.\n\n8\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.820\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.350\nwe're gonna be looking at doing\nsome basic Linux configuration.\n\n10\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.830\nIn previous episodes, we've kind of\ngot the lay of the land with Linux and\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.170\nnow we need to know how\ndo we configure this.\n\n12\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.760\nWe need to work with user accounts and\nworking with the user accounts passwords,\n\n13\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.890\nand here to helps us to that is our\nlocal Linux guru, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.610\nHow you doing, Daniel?\n\n15\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.490\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.650\nHopefully you are as well.\n\n17\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.260\nWe've spent a lot of time and effort\ndeveloping this here series for you.\n\n18\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170\nSo hopefully you enjoy it and\nyou learn a lot from it.\n\n19\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.095\nThat's what I'm hoping for, anyway,\nas I've said quite a few times already.\n\n20\n00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:54.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's jump in, mike is right.\n\n21\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.277\nHe's actually looked at\nthe notes beforehand and\n\n22\n00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:58.190\nknows exactly what we're gonna talk about.\n\n23\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I got my cheat sheet.\n\n24\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.570\n&gt;&gt; That cheater.\n\n25\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Cheater.\n\n26\n00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, we'll give it to you,\nhow about that?\n\n27\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.060\nLet's bring you in on the joke and\non the fun, so that you too can\n\n28\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.880\nrun a Linux system, be at least somewhat\nof a good administrator there and\n\n29\n00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.620\nget your feet wet and\nhave some experience there.\n\n30\n00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.380\nThat being said, let's talk about,\nlet's start with users.\n\n31\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140\nIt's a great place to start.\n\n32\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.108\nWe have users, otherwise what's\nkind of the point of the system?\n\n33\n00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:25.070\nIf you're gonna have a computer I guess\nyou could have automated stuff but.\n\n34\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.870\n&gt;&gt; Is the room warm?\n\n35\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you start it up and it just does\none thing and continues on from there.\n\n36\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.760\nBut typically, we're talking about\nan enterprise environment or\n\n37\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.550\na multi-user environment even,\nwhere you have multiple administrators,\n\n38\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.090\nmultiple different types of\nusers that do different tasks.\n\n39\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.630\nAnd getting in to that whole ecosystem of\ncomputing, which is typical of anybody.\n\n40\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.370\nAnd if you're trying to get in security.\n\n41\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.790\nUsers are definitely usually your\nweakest link, to be honest with you.\n\n42\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.420\nThey'll give up the ghost for\nyou every time.\n\n43\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They'll slap their password on a sticky\n\n44\n00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:59.779\nnote right there on their keyboard or\ntheir monitor,\n\n45\n00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.819\nwhich I think is Myst approved now.\n\n46\n00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:02.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What was that\n\n47\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.400\none thing we were watching\nwhere I think for a candy bar,\n\n48\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.310\nyou can get somebody's password\nto their work account.\n\n49\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's ridiculous.\n\n50\n00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:14.260\nBut they're part of our lives, so we need\nto be able to at least work with them and\n\n51\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.440\nset them up and create new users and\nthings of that nature.\n\n52\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.740\nThat's what we wanna dive into today,\nso let's get going.\n\n53\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.800\nLet's start about the first\nuser in a Linux system.\n\n54\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.780\nWho is that?\n\n55\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.820\nIt's the almighty, the main man himself,\nor woman, as it may be is Root.\n\n56\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.410\nI don't know where\nthe word Root comes from,\n\n57\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.560\nmaybe because it's the bottom of the tree\nand everything grows out of that.\n\n58\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.755\nThat would be my best guess I've\nnever officially looked up, why.\n\n59\n00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:41.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The system administrator,\n\n60\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.940\nthe almighty god of that\nLinux system is called Root.\n\n61\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.850\nBut that's what it's called.\n\n62\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.380\n&gt;&gt; I thought that's what just\nthe reverse of beautiful password toor.\n\n63\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that's exactly.\n\n64\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.682\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nwhy are you telling everybody our secrets?\n\n65\n00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:54.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't use that.\n\n66\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.635\nThat's a bad password.\n\n67\n00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:57.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which we will talk about right,\n\n68\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.580\nin our user that we're going\nto start talking about today.\n\n69\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.990\nSo root is, like I've said,\nits the almighty users.\n\n70\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.030\nThe main system administrator.\n\n71\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.490\nThey have all rights.\n\n72\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.510\nThey can do anything that they wanna do.\n\n73\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.699\nRoot is so powerful,\nthat root can harm the system.\n\n74\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.040\nThis is why hackers, they want root,\nbecause they can harm your system, or\n\n75\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.740\nthey can control your system in a way\nthat's beneficial to themselves, and\n\n76\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.530\nwhich is why we're trying to keep\nroot out of everything we can.\n\n77\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.890\nNow root is necessary,\nroot is a necessary evil.\n\n78\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.450\nWe need that level of control.\n\n79\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.811\nBecause some programs require that.\n\n80\n00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.332\nAnd we need root to be\nable to run that for them.\n\n81\n00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:41.803\nOr, we need to make some sort of\nadministrative change that system down\n\n82\n00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:45.317\nit's it bowels of system,\nroot is a good user for that.\n\n83\n00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.649\nBut typically, when I started using Linux.\n\n84\n00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.470\nBecause, when you installed your\nLinux system you were root.\n\n85\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.810\nIt was a feather in the cap,\nI am the root user.\n\n86\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.600\nI'm logging in as root,\nevery day of my life.\n\n87\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.130\nWe've come to find out\nthat's not such a good idea.\n\n88\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.240\nThat's bad security,\nthat's bad administration.\n\n89\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.620\nYou don't want to log in as root,\nif you can help it.\n\n90\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.200\nTypically, you wanna log in as a standard\nuser that has administrative privileges.\n\n91\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.100\nThat's the better model.\n\n92\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.110\nSometimes you will be left with no choice.\n\n93\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.220\nI can't think of anything off\nthe top of my head right now,\n\n94\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.550\nwhy you would log in as root,\n\n95\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.850\nespecially if you have administrative\nprivileges under your user account.\n\n96\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.400\nBut every now and then, you'll try to\ndo something with your administrative\n\n97\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.410\nprivileges well in hand and\nit just doesn't do it.\n\n98\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.876\nSo you pull out the big dog.\n\n99\n00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:41.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is root, and there you go.\n\n100\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.617\nAnd it'll work, because why?\n\n101\n00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.827\nBecause root can do whatever root wants,\nand the system that.\n\n102\n00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:51.307\nSometimes it might warn, hey, I'm just\nletting you know that's not a good idea.\n\n103\n00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:54.520\n&gt;&gt; If you do this, I might never\nstart again, but I'll let you do it.\n\n104\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.290\nYou are root.\n\n105\n00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, it might warn you,\nbut it won't stop you.\n\n106\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.400\nSo that is an important safety tip when it\ncomes to working in a Linux environment.\n\n107\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.030\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n108\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.780\nLet's see here, if you do need to elevate\nyour privileges to root-like levels,\n\n109\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.960\nwe have a neat little program called SUDU.\n\n110\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.190\nSo if you're part of the SUDUers group,\nthen you get SUDUers privileges.\n\n111\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.710\nAnd that an amazing thing,\nthat's a wonderful thing.\n\n112\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.830\nWe like it.\n\n113\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.836\nAnd that will allow you to\nact as root when you need to,\n\n114\n00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:29.076\nby issuing the SUDU command.\n\n115\n00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:30.930\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n116\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.490\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n117\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.290\nActually, I'm on my Cali, let me jump\nover to my Mac operating system and\n\n118\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.440\nI'm gonna SSH in, cuz this is\nreally a little more practical.\n\n119\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.142\nI'm gonna SSH in to a CentOS server\nthat I have here at ITPro TV.\n\n120\n00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.924\nYes, so now Mike knows where it is.\n\n121\n00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.988\nHe is gonna attack it today.\n\n122\n00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:55.630\n[LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.177\n&gt;&gt; It's a default install, so\nhe's probably going [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:00.773\nLet me put in my password.\n\n125\n00:06:02.903 --> 00:06:07.371\nAnd now I am logged in and noticed that\nthis changed from my ITProTV to my\n\n126\n00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.121\nlocalhost, which is that CentOS system.\n\n127\n00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:14.810\nIf I wanna do something\nadministrative like, I don't know.\n\n128\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.981\nHow about if I try to\nchange the /etc/psswd file,\n\n129\n00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:24.610\nwhich is where the users password,\nor shadow file I guess is better.\n\n130\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.012\nIf I try to nano, which is a text\neditor that runs from the command line.\n\n131\n00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:37.410\nIf I try to do that\nnano /etc/shadow thing.\n\n132\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.320\nYou'll notice I get this.\n\n133\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.949\nError reading ncshadow, permission denied.\n\n134\n00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.170\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n135\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.440\nThat's the system security\nworking properly.\n\n136\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.340\nI am a standard user logged into\nthis system, I am not root.\n\n137\n00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.240\nSo it told me permission denied.\n\n138\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.480\nIf you look at the permissions\non the shadow file.\n\n139\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.200\nOnly one person has access to that file.\n\n140\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.860\nAnd that is root or\npeople in the SUDUers group.\n\n141\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.440\nYou can jump your privileges.\n\n142\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.150\nSo how do I do that?\n\n143\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.954\nIf I wanna look at this file,\nwhat do I do?\n\n144\n00:07:07.954 --> 00:07:10.371\nLet me exit out of here, Ctrl+X.\n\n145\n00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:15.615\nAnd if I just add sudo\nto my command let's see,\n\n146\n00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:18.320\n/shadow, like that.\n\n147\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.775\nIt's gonna ask me for a password.\n\n148\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.950\nAnd now,\nyou'll see I have access to the file.\n\n149\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.030\nIt elevated my privileges.\n\n150\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.920\nSo if I need to do something like\nthat I can, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.010\nget out of that here,\ncuz that's an actual password right there,\n\n152\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.510\nI don't think you can see the end of it,\nso.\n\n153\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if you screenshot that,\n\n154\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.180\nyou're not gonna get the entire\nstring to eat my lunch with, and\n\n155\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.632\nyou're never gonna crack it, anyway,\nso, good luck with you on that.\n\n156\n00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:42.512\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The guy who\n\n157\n00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:44.477\nuses SD characters in his passwords,\nyou won't get hacked.\n\n158\n00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:46.712\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n159\n00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:51.250\nI'm not really scared about showing\nthe encrypted value of my passwords.\n\n160\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.373\nWe'll talk about that\nactually in just a bit,\n\n161\n00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.634\nwhen we start setting up passwords for\nour users.\n\n162\n00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:58.787\nLet's go back to talking about Sudu.\n\n163\n00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:01.990\nSo Sudu allows me to\nact as a standard user.\n\n164\n00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.827\nNormally, and when I need to\nelevate privileges I can do that.\n\n165\n00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:10.696\nSo what if I need to add somebody like\nMike to the sudoo group, what do I do?\n\n166\n00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:14.100\nWell, there's a couple\nof ways you can do this.\n\n167\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.937\nAnd I've never worked specifically as\nan administrator where I'd do this\n\n168\n00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.095\non a daily basis.\n\n169\n00:08:20.095 --> 00:08:22.636\nYou have to do this from time to time,\nand every now and\n\n170\n00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.430\nthen you dust off the skill-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.238\n&gt;&gt; And you show somebody else how\n\n172\n00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.116\nto do it like I'm doing for you.\n\n173\n00:08:26.116 --> 00:08:29.979\nSo one way to do it is via sudo or\nby sudoo,\n\n174\n00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:33.753\nhowever you can say sudo or sudoo here.\n\n175\n00:08:33.753 --> 00:08:35.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everyone knows what you're\n\n176\n00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:35.777\ntalking about.\n\n177\n00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:38.609\nAnd no one should snub\ntheir nose at you for that.\n\n178\n00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:42.250\nSo I like to say via sudo and\nuse sudoo as the word.\n\n179\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, enjoy.\n\n180\n00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.203\nI double dip.\n\n181\n00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:45.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n182\n00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:50.191\n&gt;&gt; So via sudo is basically I'm\ninitiating my via text editor and\n\n183\n00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:53.656\nI'm doing it on the sudoer's file, right?\n\n184\n00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:59.128\nI could just as easily\nhit vi/etsy/sudoers,\n\n185\n00:08:59.128 --> 00:09:03.244\nand edit the file there and do that.\n\n186\n00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:05.156\nBut via sudo is kinda like\na nice little shortcut, so\n\n187\n00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:06.378\nlittle healthy tip for you guys.\n\n188\n00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:07.541\n&gt;&gt; Cool, very cool.\n\n189\n00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:08.718\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at that.\n\n190\n00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:11.650\nIf I want to actually do it,\nand let's just do it.\n\n191\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.680\nLet's just do visudo, sudo, sudo.\n\n192\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.248\nLook at that, so what do I need to do?\n\n193\n00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:20.413\nI gotta run sudo.\n\n194\n00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:21.038\nYou gotta sudo.\n\n195\n00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:21.911\n&gt;&gt; By sudo.\n\n196\n00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:23.258\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's fun right?\n\n197\n00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:25.755\nIt gets entertaining really quickly.\n\n198\n00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:29.840\nA sudo visudo, and you'll notice it didn't\nask me for a password there, right?\n\n199\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.890\nEven though I typed in sudo,\nit just did it.\n\n200\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.880\nYou're thinking, whow, how does that work?\n\n201\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.306\nWell there's like a time out that says if\nyou run the sudo command within x amount\n\n202\n00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:41.444\nof time, I forget.\n\n203\n00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:42.940\nIt's in the configuration file somewhere.\n\n204\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.522\n&gt;&gt; So it cached the fact that you\nran just a couple seconds ago.\n\n205\n00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:47.259\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's nice.\n\n206\n00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:52.250\nIf you're doing a lot of things, you still\ndon't need to switch to the root user.\n\n207\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.902\nI can just get to add sudo as\nthe beginning of my command,\n\n208\n00:09:54.902 --> 00:09:57.677\nI don't have to continually\nadd my password afterwards.\n\n209\n00:09:57.677 --> 00:10:00.220\nIt's a nice feature that\nthey thought of everything.\n\n210\n00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.576\nWhat I can do is I can go\ndown here in this file,\n\n211\n00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:05.071\nyou'll notice it's got\na lot of information.\n\n212\n00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.559\nAnd there should be an area\nthat shows the root user.\n\n213\n00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:10.857\nLet's see, where are you hiding?\n\n214\n00:10:10.857 --> 00:10:13.732\nYeah, this one's very large.\n\n215\n00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:17.888\nTypically, not this large,\nbut this is, my goodness.\n\n216\n00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:20.140\nThere it is, that's what I'm looking for.\n\n217\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.850\nAll right, so this says,\nallow route to run any commands anywhere.\n\n218\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.751\nI would just basically\nappend this say dlowrie.\n\n219\n00:10:28.751 --> 00:10:33.206\nIt says vi, so\nI gotta do insert after I did and\n\n220\n00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:39.085\nthen do dlowrie, and\nthen copy everythhing I see above me.\n\n221\n00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.677\nLike that, oop, like that,\n\n222\n00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:47.460\nI can add users that way to make\nthem part of the sudoers group.\n\n223\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.129\nThat's one way to do it,\nthere's another way to do it.\n\n224\n00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:53.526\nThere's a usermod command that makes\nthis process a whole lot less painless.\n\n225\n00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:59.580\nSo I'm not gonna save this, so\nmake sure that quit, there we go.\n\n226\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.156\nI didn't save my changes and\nwe're gonna get into the vi editor and\n\n227\n00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:02.850\nhow you use that.\n\n228\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just I didn't save my changes, and\n\n229\n00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:07.378\neven says that.\n\n230\n00:11:07.378 --> 00:11:11.199\nUnchanged, all right, so\nlet's use the usermod commands,\n\n231\n00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:15.105\nprobably the more user friendly\nway in which you would do this.\n\n232\n00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:16.938\nI'm already in the sudoers here.\n\n233\n00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:19.908\nLet me jump back over to, here we go.\n\n234\n00:11:19.908 --> 00:11:21.889\nThis box here.\n\n235\n00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.668\nNotice, I am logged in as root.\n\n236\n00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:29.517\nSo I won't need the sudo command here,\nbut if I was doing it the right way.\n\n237\n00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:32.605\nI would need sudo like that,\nbut I won't here.\n\n238\n00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:39.189\nI'll need usermod,\nusermod -a -G and then say sudo and\n\n239\n00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:44.001\nthen whatever, like Mike's mrodrick.\n\n240\n00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:47.920\nI did add you to this system, like that.\n\n241\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.969\nSpelled it correctly, Mike?\n\n242\n00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.342\n&gt;&gt; Privilege escalation.\n\n243\n00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:52.372\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[CROSSTALK] Getting it for a freebie.\n\n244\n00:11:52.372 --> 00:11:54.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice no barking.\n\n245\n00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:56.500\nMike is now a sudoer.\n\n246\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.278\nIf he logged in,\nhe would be able to sudo commands and\n\n247\n00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:00.994\nrun anything that he needed to.\n\n248\n00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:03.569\n&gt;&gt; I think you've talked about\nthis before, but in that command,\n\n249\n00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:05.106\nI see a lowercase a and an uppercase G.\n\n250\n00:12:05.106 --> 00:12:06.006\nCase sensitive, right?\n\n251\n00:12:06.006 --> 00:12:07.270\n&gt;&gt; Case sensitive, that's right.\n\n252\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.659\nAnd Linux, all case sensitivity.\n\n253\n00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:12.116\nYou can not get away with\nthe willy nilly Windows stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:14.524\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where you just type in anything you\n\n255\n00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:17.330\nlike, and that's the winner of the day.\n\n256\n00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.223\nAnd there's a good reason for that, it's\nbecause there's usually a lot of lowercase\n\n257\n00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:23.368\nr means this,\nuppercase R means that, right?\n\n258\n00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.550\nSo hence-\n&gt;&gt; Ran out of letters and need more.\n\n259\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so a very good point.\n\n260\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.902\nThank you for bringing that up, Mike.\n\n261\n00:12:28.902 --> 00:12:31.200\nThat's a very handy, handy thing to know.\n\n262\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.752\nAll right, so now we know how to\nmake somebody an administrator.\n\n263\n00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:37.338\nLet's talk about adding user accounts.\n\n264\n00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:41.097\nAll right, so\nnow I've hired our new temp worker or\n\n265\n00:12:41.097 --> 00:12:45.567\nthe new ground floor IT kid is\ngonna work the help desk for us.\n\n266\n00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:47.881\nSomething like that,\nthere's a new user in town.\n\n267\n00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.430\nWe need to add them to the system.\n\n268\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.290\nWhat do we do?\n\n269\n00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.320\nWhat's really cool is there's\nactually two ways to do this, and\n\n270\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.897\nthis can get confusing believe it or not.\n\n271\n00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:57.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n272\n00:12:57.779 --> 00:12:59.240\nImagine that.\n&gt;&gt; Surprise, surprise.\n\n273\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.781\n&gt;&gt; Well who would've thought it, Michael?\n\n274\n00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:06.584\nYou can do it one of two ways,\nyou can do user add or add user, right?\n\n275\n00:13:06.584 --> 00:13:07.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n276\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.667\nif they throw this at you on the test,\nwhat way is the proper way to add a user?\n\n277\n00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.795\nIs it user add or add user,\nor user something else,\n\n278\n00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:17.010\ngives you a couple of other options?\n\n279\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:17.557\nUser add and\n\n280\n00:13:17.557 --> 00:13:20.858\nadd user will both work on just about\nevery system that I've worked on.\n\n281\n00:13:20.858 --> 00:13:25.310\nVery rarely, have I run into the fact\nthat one or the other was not there?\n\n282\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.171\n&gt;&gt; Wow, really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n283\n00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.229\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n284\n00:13:27.229 --> 00:13:29.506\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say that they\ndo work differently,\n\n285\n00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:32.109\nsometimes they're just\nan alias of each other.\n\n286\n00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:34.820\nBut if I'm remembering correctly,\nyou know what?\n\n287\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.145\nLet's play with this.\n\n288\n00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:38.137\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it.\n&gt;&gt; Let's run it up the flag pole and\n\n289\n00:13:38.137 --> 00:13:39.118\nsee who salutes.\n\n290\n00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.903\nLet's do adduser and let's hit return.\n\n291\n00:13:42.903 --> 00:13:44.579\nOkay, only one or two names left.\n\n292\n00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:51.410\nSo I didn't give it any options or\nvariables or dash as or whatever.\n\n293\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.230\nSo it's barking at me, so\nlet me know I'm not using it correctly.\n\n294\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:00.995\nSo I do know how to use this one, I say\nadduser, and let's create one for Titus.\n\n295\n00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:04.028\nSo t rush, hit return.\n\n296\n00:14:04.028 --> 00:14:07.323\nCool, so it says adding user t rush,\nadding new groups.\n\n297\n00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:13.620\nIt's creating his own group,\nadding new user t rush to his group.\n\n298\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.709\nCreating his home directory and\ncopying files from this etsy-scale.\n\n299\n00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:21.760\nBasically a framework for what should\ngo in your home directory, things like\n\n300\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.517\nthe downloads folder, documents folder or\ntemp folder, things of that nature, right?\n\n301\n00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:29.407\nSo it's copying from there\ninto this home folder and\n\n302\n00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:32.107\nnow it's asking me to\nenter a new UNIX password.\n\n303\n00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:37.177\nAll right, I can do that, I'll give him\na super secret password of password.\n\n304\n00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:39.087\n[LAUGH] I wanna give password1.\n\n305\n00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:43.003\nThere we go, retype it.\n\n306\n00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:47.418\nAnd password is updated successfully,\nchanging the user information for t rush,\n\n307\n00:14:47.418 --> 00:14:48.720\nenter the new value.\n\n308\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.397\nWhat's his full name?\n\n309\n00:14:49.397 --> 00:14:53.294\nOkay, we'll title this Rush, and\nif he's in and office number or\n\n310\n00:14:53.294 --> 00:14:56.017\nroom number specifically,\nI could put down.\n\n311\n00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:59.337\nWe'll say he's in room two,\nwhat's his work phone number?\n\n312\n00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.598\n555-5555.\n\n313\n00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:03.518\nYou don't have to put anything,\nI could just leave it blank.\n\n314\n00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:05.542\nI don't know his home phone number,\nso I just hit Enter.\n\n315\n00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:08.347\nAnything else I wanna know about Titus,\nI could put that in there.\n\n316\n00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:14.270\nHe's a switcher/editor like so.\n\n317\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.550\nCool, hit return.\n\n318\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.554\nIs this information correct?\n\n319\n00:15:16.554 --> 00:15:19.510\nAllows me to go back and\nfix any mistakes I may have made.\n\n320\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.546\nSo if his phone number\ndoesn't look correct.\n\n321\n00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably not going to work.\n\n322\n00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:28.800\nBut for this intents and\npurposes I'll say, yes, hit return.\n\n323\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.948\nAnd now, we have a new user\nin the system named t rush.\n\n324\n00:15:31.948 --> 00:15:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Easy.\n\n325\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.919\n&gt;&gt; Very simple, very simple.\n\n326\n00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:37.594\nLet's see what happens if I do user add.\n\n327\n00:15:37.594 --> 00:15:40.981\nAnd yeah, that gives me a little\nbit different output here.\n\n328\n00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:43.370\nTelling me, hey,\nyou don't have some options.\n\n329\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:48.991\nHere's what it should be, and\nhere's some kind of usage.\n\n330\n00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:53.570\nUser -d, -d stands for\nthe defaults, print and\n\n331\n00:15:53.570 --> 00:16:00.860\nchange default user add confederation,\nbut I could just say, user add.\n\n332\n00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.051\nAnd we'll go with Megan.\n\n333\n00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:05.523\nIt's Megan Bentley.\n\n334\n00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:10.013\nI believe that's how she spells it, and\nthen just adds a user mbently, right?\n\n335\n00:16:10.013 --> 00:16:13.725\nIf I wanted to, I could go through looking\nat all the different options, making sure.\n\n336\n00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:17.768\nBut add user was a whole lot easier,\nbecause it's more like a script that runs.\n\n337\n00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:18.995\nIt's input driven.\n\n338\n00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:21.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz user add,\nit let's you create that user.\n\n339\n00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:24.661\nBut you didn't set the password or\nanything like that,\n\n340\n00:16:24.661 --> 00:16:28.645\nso at this point that account is\nprobably not useable or is it?\n\n341\n00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:30.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe Meagan account is not useable really.\n\n342\n00:16:30.598 --> 00:16:31.147\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n343\n00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:34.123\n&gt;&gt; I mean it has no password, you can't\nlogin cuz there's no password set.\n\n344\n00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.651\nThere's no home directory,\nI would have to go in and create all that.\n\n345\n00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:41.661\nAgain, I would need to do something\nlike this -m which is --create home.\n\n346\n00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:42.453\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n347\n00:16:42.453 --> 00:16:46.944\nI would have to put all these options\nin and run it through Megan's account.\n\n348\n00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:51.232\nSo add user obviously a whole lot\neasier to work with than user add.\n\n349\n00:16:51.232 --> 00:16:54.699\nSo I'd suggest just doing that,\nit was a lot nicer.\n\n350\n00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:56.878\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else do we have?\n\n351\n00:16:56.878 --> 00:17:03.254\nSo what if I have coming,\nI'm DLowrie, right?\n\n352\n00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:11.307\nI'm in the system, what if I have\nto actually log in as root, right?\n\n353\n00:17:11.307 --> 00:17:15.222\nDo I have to log out or\nopen another terminal?\n\n354\n00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:17.515\nWhat do we do?\n\n355\n00:17:17.515 --> 00:17:20.342\nWhat you typically will do,\nis you try to run your sudo.\n\n356\n00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:24.003\nIf your sudo stuff doesn't work,\nyou're still getting permission denied,\n\n357\n00:17:24.003 --> 00:17:26.550\nsomething is happening, whatever reason.\n\n358\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.910\nI need to switch my user account to root,\nI want to be root.\n\n359\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.909\nI can do it with the su command or\nthe switch user command,\n\n360\n00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.917\nI believe that's what su stands for.\n\n361\n00:17:36.917 --> 00:17:40.139\nIf you're ever wondering how\nto use any of these commands.\n\n362\n00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:42.082\nI should have told you this\nlike a million years ago.\n\n363\n00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:44.821\nBut you can look at the manual page for\neach one of them.\n\n364\n00:17:44.821 --> 00:17:47.968\nSo just do man and\nthen whatever the command is.\n\n365\n00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:51.733\nSo I wanted this one,\nsu which I believe is switch user.\n\n366\n00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:53.536\nYeah, change user becomes super user.\n\n367\n00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:55.733\nI think super user is\nwhat it's intended for.\n\n368\n00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:59.840\nBut you can switch users to\npeople that aren't super users.\n\n369\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.585\nSo change user id or become a super user.\n\n370\n00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:07.991\nIf I just use su, and\nyou just type q to get out of this.\n\n371\n00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:11.346\nAnd you can just read everything\nabout everything you want to know\n\n372\n00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:13.850\nabout su command right\nhere in this manual file.\n\n373\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:18.651\nSo man command will help you out, that's\nbasically the help files in the system.\n\n374\n00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:23.555\nSo let's see here,\nlet me quit out of here.\n\n375\n00:18:23.555 --> 00:18:27.033\nLet's use it,\nI'm gonna switch to my dlowrie account.\n\n376\n00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:30.179\nBada bing,\nyou'll notice that my prompt has changed.\n\n377\n00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.859\nI am now dlowrie,\nI'm not logged in as root anymore.\n\n378\n00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:38.411\nYou'll notice over here as well that\nthis prompt is no longer a hash or\n\n379\n00:18:38.411 --> 00:18:41.580\na pound symbol, it's a dollar sign.\n\n380\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.770\nThat dollar sign lets me know I'm\nlogged in as a regular user, right?\n\n381\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:49.110\nThe hash sign lets me know that I'm root,\nokay?\n\n382\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.350\nNow I can type in exit, which will\ntake me back to what I was before.\n\n383\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.511\nBut I'm kind of like,\nI'm gonna layer this up a little bit.\n\n384\n00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:01.308\nI'm gonna su into root instead of\nexiting back down to root, okay?\n\n385\n00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:06.865\nSo if you just type in su, it's gonna\nassume that you wanna become root.\n\n386\n00:19:06.865 --> 00:19:09.564\nAnd it's gonna ask you for\nroot's password, which I will type in.\n\n387\n00:19:13.073 --> 00:19:16.103\nAnd you'll notice that now it has changed.\n\n388\n00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:20.476\nI am showing up as root with\nthe hash symbol at the end.\n\n389\n00:19:20.476 --> 00:19:23.708\nLetting me know that my prompt\nhas changed, I am the root user.\n\n390\n00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.468\nWell watch, this is gonna be fun.\n\n391\n00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:28.008\nI type in exits, I'm Daniel Lowery again.\n\n392\n00:19:28.008 --> 00:19:29.724\nI type in exits, I'm root again.\n\n393\n00:19:29.724 --> 00:19:32.124\nI've got schizophrenia all day long,\nit's a lot of fun.\n\n394\n00:19:32.124 --> 00:19:33.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n395\n00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:38.813\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see here,\nwe're doing a lot of good stuff here,\n\n396\n00:19:38.813 --> 00:19:40.657\nwith our user accounts.\n\n397\n00:19:40.657 --> 00:19:42.449\nWhere are we at to here?\n\n398\n00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.594\n&gt;&gt; Setting passwords, I believe.\n\n399\n00:19:44.594 --> 00:19:48.017\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a very, very good skill\nto have because guess what?\n\n400\n00:19:48.017 --> 00:19:51.400\nIf you've worked in any kind\nof environment with users,\n\n401\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.708\nthey're going to call you one day and\nsay, I need to change my password.\n\n402\n00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:58.684\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know if this is\ngonna be in our lesson today.\n\n403\n00:19:58.684 --> 00:20:02.106\nWe also have a question in the chatroom\nabout maybe modifying some of those\n\n404\n00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:04.935\nproperties, you set on the user accounts,\nif that fits in.\n\n405\n00:20:04.935 --> 00:20:06.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we get time we'll try and\njump on that.\n\n406\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.937\nIf not we'll handle it,\n[INAUDIBLE] sessions.\n\n407\n00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:12.615\nBut yeah,\nlet's continue the gravy train, and\n\n408\n00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:15.740\nthen we'll tackle that\nstuff in just a minute.\n\n409\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.290\nSo how do we change a password?\n\n410\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.531\nWhat do I do?\nI got a user and\n\n411\n00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:21.429\nthey need a password reset,\nhow do I make that happen?\n\n412\n00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.454\nLet's see.\n&gt;&gt; Well I can tell you it's\n\n413\n00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:24.256\nnot PWD cuz we learned that the other day,\nright?\n\n414\n00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:26.208\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was print working directory.\n\n415\n00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:28.331\nIt's the one that always threw me,\ncuz it sounds like password to me.\n\n416\n00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:30.539\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nMike has the hardest time with this one.\n\n417\n00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:31.275\nAnd he's a smart guy.\n\n418\n00:20:31.275 --> 00:20:32.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know why?\n\n419\n00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:34.987\nBecause things in Linux can get confusing.\n\n420\n00:20:34.987 --> 00:20:38.091\nWe said it once,\nwe've said it a million times.\n\n421\n00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:40.855\nThat everything seems so\nvery similar and it's like isn't this?\n\n422\n00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:41.587\nNo, it's not that.\n\n423\n00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:43.488\nYeah, do it like that.\n\n424\n00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:47.193\nIt's really hard to keep your brain\nwrapped around it unless you're doing it\n\n425\n00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:47.765\n24/7.\n\n426\n00:20:47.765 --> 00:20:51.520\nThat's why I would suggest to\nwatch the installation episode.\n\n427\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.046\nInstall Linux, start using it and\nsome fashion to where you can really get\n\n428\n00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:59.851\ncomfortable with it because it's\nan easy skill to get rusty.\n\n429\n00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:05.455\nSo the command Mike is alluding to\nis passwd is very similar to pwd,\n\n430\n00:21:05.455 --> 00:21:10.571\nwhich seems, but\nthey do two completely different things.\n\n431\n00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:14.836\nPWD is print working directory, and\nthen the password changing utility,\n\n432\n00:21:14.836 --> 00:21:15.858\nwhich is passwd.\n\n433\n00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:20.518\nSo let's do that, I am logged in as,\nI'm having to keep this-\n\n434\n00:21:20.518 --> 00:21:21.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:21:21.277 --> 00:21:24.599\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna keep myself, who am I again,\n\n436\n00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:26.567\nwhat person am I today?\n\n437\n00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:28.850\nI am root so I won't need sodu.\n\n438\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.189\nSo let's change Mike's password, right?\n\n439\n00:21:32.189 --> 00:21:37.113\nSo we do passwd, and\nthen mrodrick like that, and\n\n440\n00:21:37.113 --> 00:21:39.826\nyou do the Linux password.\n\n441\n00:21:39.826 --> 00:21:44.519\nMike, I'll make your password, password1.\n\n442\n00:21:44.519 --> 00:21:48.274\nHit Enter, password1, retype it in.\n\n443\n00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:50.962\nAnd the password's now\nupdated successfully.\n\n444\n00:21:50.962 --> 00:21:53.204\nVery simple process,\na very easy utility and\n\n445\n00:21:53.204 --> 00:21:55.986\nsomething you'll probably\nget a lot of mileage out of.\n\n446\n00:21:55.986 --> 00:21:59.709\nObviously, that's not\nthe extent of its capabilities.\n\n447\n00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:06.580\nIf you man password like so, it will give\nyou every bell and whistle under the sun.\n\n448\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.737\nI'm sure it's starting to give you\na hints for user passwords and\n\n449\n00:22:11.737 --> 00:22:15.770\noptions, setting expirations,\nlooking a help,\n\n450\n00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.202\ninactivity, tokens,\nlocking all sort of good stuff.\n\n451\n00:22:20.202 --> 00:22:22.758\nAgain, we don't have to get\nyou to that kind of level,\n\n452\n00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.603\nyou just have to know what passwd does.\n\n453\n00:22:24.603 --> 00:22:27.696\nHow to change your username or how to\nchange password, if someone calls and\n\n454\n00:22:27.696 --> 00:22:29.919\ndoes that,\nthat's just basically where we're at.\n\n455\n00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:31.957\nPassword changing is a good thing, right?\n\n456\n00:22:31.957 --> 00:22:36.520\nWe wanna make sure that passwords never\nget too old or long in the tooth.\n\n457\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.242\nBecause there are bad guys out there\nactively working at passwords that they've\n\n458\n00:22:41.242 --> 00:22:43.195\ngrabbed, trying to crack them.\n\n459\n00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:46.427\nSo you never know if your password has\nbeen grabbed and is being worked upon.\n\n460\n00:22:46.427 --> 00:22:49.570\nSo you should regularly change your\npasswords, good security measure.\n\n461\n00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.422\nLet's see here, where are we at here?\n\n462\n00:22:54.422 --> 00:22:57.810\nSo yeah, let's check the user\naccount status real quick.\n\n463\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.405\nThis is a neat little command called,\nI think it's called chage, or\n\n464\n00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:04.158\nchag-e, or something.\n\n465\n00:23:04.158 --> 00:23:10.771\nIt's C-H age, that's basically it,\nC-H-A-G-E like that, I like chage.\n\n466\n00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:12.275\nI think it sounds cool, right?\n\n467\n00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:13.587\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n468\n00:23:13.587 --> 00:23:15.625\n&gt;&gt; But that's probably not\nthe correct way to say it.\n\n469\n00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:22.281\nIf we do chage-l, basically listing\nthe properties of the user, so mroderick.\n\n470\n00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:25.308\nAnd with that we get some\ninformation about his accounts,\n\n471\n00:23:25.308 --> 00:23:28.659\nwhen his last password change was,\nwhich obviously was today.\n\n472\n00:23:28.659 --> 00:23:30.537\nHis password expires never, right.\n\n473\n00:23:30.537 --> 00:23:33.598\nSo he's never gonna be prompted\nto change his password.\n\n474\n00:23:33.598 --> 00:23:35.155\nPassword is inactive.\n\n475\n00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:36.051\nNo, it's not.\n\n476\n00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:38.867\nIt's never going to be inactive\ncuz we have that property set.\n\n477\n00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:40.012\nAccount expires never,\n\n478\n00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:43.070\nhis account will always be around\nunless we make a change, right.\n\n479\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.107\nAs of this point, this is where it's at.\n\n480\n00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:47.550\nMinimum number of days\nbetween password changes.\n\n481\n00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:54.320\nWe're starting to see a lot of bad\npractice here just out of default.\n\n482\n00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.497\nBut that's the way Linux works.\n\n483\n00:23:55.497 --> 00:23:58.137\nLinux assumes you know what\nthe heck you're doing.\n\n484\n00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.558\nYou go in and you make the change.\n\n485\n00:23:59.558 --> 00:24:03.409\nYou set it up the way you want it,\nwe're not gonna put, Restrictions on you.\n\n486\n00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:04.238\nYou are a professional.\n\n487\n00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:05.779\nThat's how they see you.\n\n488\n00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.610\nThey give you that honor.\n\n489\n00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.254\nAnd it might not be true.\n\n490\n00:24:08.254 --> 00:24:10.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know that there's a lot of ways that\n\n491\n00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:13.301\nI shouldn't be allowed to\ntouch a computer, right?\n\n492\n00:24:13.301 --> 00:24:15.389\nBut they assume that you know\nwhat the heck you're doing, and\n\n493\n00:24:15.389 --> 00:24:17.540\nif you don't you'll learn it and\nyou'll get around to it.\n\n494\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.130\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n495\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.340\nSo it's a neat little thing, if Mike was\nexpired and he was having trouble logging\n\n496\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.710\nin, he could run this command and\nsee that that's what happened.\n\n497\n00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.790\nOr Mike's saying, my password's not\nworking and I haven't changed it.\n\n498\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.570\nAnd I haven't been prompted to change it.\n\n499\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.270\nAnd you go and you saw it was changed\nyesterday, and Mike has no recollection of\n\n500\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.490\nany change happening,\nyou know something has happened.\n\n501\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.460\nSomeone has changed his password and\nlogged in using it, and\n\n502\n00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.060\nthen you start looking at logs.\n\n503\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.880\nSo just a good area for us to keep\nsecurity-minded when it comes to users and\n\n504\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.380\ntheir accounts.\n\n505\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.196\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n506\n00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:51.850\nDisabling user accounts.\n\n507\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:53.342\nMaybe Mikey's been a bad boy.\n\n508\n00:24:53.342 --> 00:24:55.470\n&gt;&gt; No!\n&gt;&gt; Right, and he's done something.\n\n509\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.880\nOr maybe he's taking a leave of absence.\n\n510\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.870\nIt's not a good practice to leave\nuser accounts just open for\n\n511\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.900\nuse when no one is using them, right?\n\n512\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.790\nThat's a bad way to practice.\n\n513\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.520\nSo we wanna disable this account.\n\n514\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.820\nMike has gone off and\nhe's taking a sabbatical for six months.\n\n515\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.890\nHe works at a university.\n\n516\n00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:13.610\nHe's a professor.\n\n517\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.690\nThat kinda thing happens.\n\n518\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.000\nIt's a real practical idea of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n519\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.160\nSo he's not gonna log in, so\nwe need to disable his account.\n\n520\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.930\nWhat do we do?\n\n521\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.850\nWe can do a couple of things.\n\n522\n00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.230\nOne of my favorite things to do is\nactually, and it's the most simple, and\n\n523\n00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.340\nit's the most effective,\nto be honest with you,\n\n524\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:38.350\nis you can just add an asterisk to his\nuser account in the /etc/passwd file.\n\n525\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.990\nYeah, very simple.\n\n526\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.760\nYou get out your favorite text editor,\nyou open the file,\n\n527\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.065\nyou add an asterisk to a certain spot,\nMike's disabled.\n\n528\n00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:48.410\nHe can't log in,\nin no way, shape, or form.\n\n529\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.740\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n530\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.360\nLet's do that.\n\n531\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.652\nLet's go here, I will cd into /etc.\n\n532\n00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:59.475\nAnd I like using nano cuz it's easy,\nquick and dirty.\n\n533\n00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:02.790\nvi is probably a little more powerful,\nbut nano's easy.\n\n534\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.460\nAnd if you don't have nano,\nthen you're gonna be stuck with vi or\n\n535\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.010\nif maybe you have a graphical one.\n\n536\n00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:14.070\nBut however you like, open up this file,\nwhich is P-S-S-W-D, like so.\n\n537\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.170\nAnd you'll notice,\nhere's all my users, and\n\n538\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.178\nservice accounts, and\nwhat not on my system.\n\n539\n00:26:22.178 --> 00:26:25.318\nIf I go all the way to the bottom,\nI'm gonna see my users,\n\n540\n00:26:25.318 --> 00:26:29.580\nbecause that's after the system gets\ninstalled and you start adding users.\n\n541\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.294\nThey typically are the last\npeople on the list here.\n\n542\n00:26:32.294 --> 00:26:33.790\nSo there's Mike.\n\n543\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.900\nYou'll see this little x right here.\n\n544\n00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.930\nThat is where we want\nto append our asterisk.\n\n545\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:45.280\nIf I just hit Shift+* and I add that\nline to, I add that little character and\n\n546\n00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.380\nI save and I go out, Mike is now not\nlogging into this system at all.\n\n547\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.960\nHe is locked out.\n\n548\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960\nI can do that.\n\n549\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.130\nI can also change his login to no login.\n\n550\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.540\nSo if I do the same thing, I open this.\n\n551\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.910\nWe drop down to the bottom where Mikey is.\n\n552\n00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.140\nI could take that out.\n\n553\n00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.470\nI can come over here, if I can get\nmy thing working here, come on,\n\n554\n00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.340\ncome on, come on, there.\n\n555\n00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.902\nAnd if I change this /bin/bash\nto /bin/nologin, login,\n\n556\n00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:22.740\nlogin, like that, and I save that,\nthe same thing will happen.\n\n557\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.270\nHe will not be able to log in,\nbecause he has no login shell.\n\n558\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.820\nSo he can't, it just can't be done.\n\n559\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.760\nSo keep those in mind.\n\n560\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.770\nThose are really quick and\neasy ways of doing this.\n\n561\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.730\nThere's another quick and easy way to\ndo this, I'm just gonna Ctrl+X and\n\n562\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.810\nhit No, which is kind of like our visudo.\n\n563\n00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:40.917\nWe got vipw.\n\n564\n00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:43.380\nIt does the exact same thing, vipw.\n\n565\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.320\nAnd it is, what is this doing?\n\n566\n00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.030\nIt's asking me to select an editor.\n\n567\n00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.135\nI have to choose a default editor here.\n\n568\n00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:53.414\nWe'll go with one, nano.\n\n569\n00:27:53.414 --> 00:27:56.546\nAnd there we go, opens up our,\nhey, we just did this.\n\n570\n00:27:56.546 --> 00:27:59.527\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Button, vi, vinano, or not vinano,\n\n571\n00:27:59.527 --> 00:28:01.620\nvipw does the exact same thing.\n\n572\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:08.236\nAll right, Another\n\n573\n00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:13.420\nway to disable an account is to do this.\n\n574\n00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.872\nLet me get it out of here, Ctrl+O.\n\n575\n00:28:15.872 --> 00:28:18.443\nActually, Y, hope I didn't ruin anything,\nCtrl+X, whatever.\n\n576\n00:28:18.443 --> 00:28:20.758\n[LAUGH] It's okay, it's a test system.\n\n577\n00:28:20.758 --> 00:28:22.360\nI can make all the damage I want.\n\n578\n00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.140\nAgain, the dangers of logging in as root,\nright, and doing root things.\n\n579\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.540\nMake sure that you do them responsibly.\n\n580\n00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.190\nI kind of jumped through there.\n\n581\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.820\nI'm sure I'm all right, but\nthat could have easily gone awry, right?\n\n582\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.280\nSo be very careful when you're\ndoing administrative tasks.\n\n583\n00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.910\nSo let's see here.\n\n584\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.140\nWe can use the usermod command\nto disable an account.\n\n585\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:47.700\nSo if I was a regular user,\nI would normally have to sudo.\n\n586\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:54.278\nBut I'm logged in as root, so\nI can just do usermod -l -e 1 test,\n\n587\n00:28:54.278 --> 00:28:58.878\nor not test user, Mike, mrodrick, like so.\n\n588\n00:28:58.878 --> 00:29:01.481\nAll right,\nlet's talk about what we're seeing here.\n\n589\n00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:04.760\n-l is to lock his account.\n\n590\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.150\nThe -e is how many days\nbefore his account expires,\n\n591\n00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.790\nbasically saying his account is expired,\nright?\n\n592\n00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.776\nIt's done.\n\n593\n00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:16.470\nAnd then that's the 1 day.\n\n594\n00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.350\nIf you don't use anything,\nit does some funky stuff, so\n\n595\n00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.130\nI always like to put at least 1 day in\nthere, even though he's locked out, right?\n\n596\n00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.460\nSo mrodrick, hit Return.\n\n597\n00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.450\nMike is now locked out.\n\n598\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:31.991\nI think if we use our chage -l option\n\n599\n00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:36.994\non mrodrick, should see some.\n\n600\n00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:39.908\nYou'll notice here,\nhis password never expires, but\n\n601\n00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:41.840\nhis account is expired in 1970.\n\n602\n00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so his account's expired and\n\n603\n00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:50.590\nhe's not logging in to this thing ever,\nbecause he's locked out.\n\n604\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.860\nNow, I will tell you this.\n\n605\n00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:57.010\nI think this will not stop him\nfrom SSHing into the system.\n\n606\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.441\nI want to throw that out there, right?\n\n607\n00:29:58.441 --> 00:30:00.229\nThat's important for you to know.\n\n608\n00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:05.680\nIf he has SSH privileges to get in\nthe system, he got access from outside,\n\n609\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.470\nhe could SSH with his user name at this\nbox, throw his password, and guess what?\n\n610\n00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.480\nMike's logging in, all right?\n\n611\n00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.580\n&gt;&gt; So really you're disabling that\nlocal user account from working, but\n\n612\n00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.090\nI can still get remote access.\n\n613\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.130\nBut now if you did the other one,\n\n614\n00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.170\nthe asterisk or the nologin,\nwould that stop the remote access too?\n\n615\n00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.703\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n616\n00:30:23.703 --> 00:30:27.490\n&gt;&gt; If you did the asterisk or\nthe nologin, he's still not getting in.\n\n617\n00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.660\nAnd we can play around\nwith that if we want.\n\n618\n00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.006\nBut yes, that's why typically\nthat's the way I do it, right?\n\n619\n00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:38.956\nYou can use this, but I like the put\nthe asterisk or put the nologin and-\n\n620\n00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:40.260\n&gt;&gt; I could see some potential.\n\n621\n00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.206\nI know that sometimes I wanna give\nsomebody the ability to administer\n\n622\n00:30:44.206 --> 00:30:48.218\na service, so maybe I give them\nthe ability to remote into a system to do\n\n623\n00:30:48.218 --> 00:30:51.525\nthat, but I don't want them\nphysically at the machine.\n\n624\n00:30:51.525 --> 00:30:54.613\nCuz then they might be able to get to\nmore things than I really want them to.\n\n625\n00:30:54.613 --> 00:30:57.310\nIt'd take me longer to\nlock everything down.\n\n626\n00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.629\nSo I could see a use for that.\n\n627\n00:30:58.629 --> 00:31:01.856\nI wanna prevent their local login, or\nphysical login, at the machine, but\n\n628\n00:31:01.856 --> 00:31:03.277\nstill allow them remote access.\n\n629\n00:31:03.277 --> 00:31:04.788\nSo that might be a cool way to do it.\n\n630\n00:31:04.788 --> 00:31:08.638\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly, so\njust be aware that that is an option and\n\n631\n00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:10.940\nthat is a part of using that system.\n\n632\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.820\nLet's see, where are we in my notes here?\n\n633\n00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.392\nWe have run usermod.\n\n634\n00:31:16.392 --> 00:31:19.473\nLet's enable accounts that\nhave been [LAUGH] disabled.\n\n635\n00:31:19.473 --> 00:31:20.803\nThat could probably be helpful.\n\n636\n00:31:20.803 --> 00:31:21.510\n&gt;&gt; That would help.\n\n637\n00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike comes back to work.\n\n638\n00:31:23.078 --> 00:31:24.525\nHe's like, hey, I can't log in, guy.\n\n639\n00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:25.511\nWhat are you doing?\n\n640\n00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:27.325\nYou're sitting over there,\nyou're watching YouTube, right?\n\n641\n00:31:27.325 --> 00:31:28.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n642\n00:31:28.602 --> 00:31:29.316\n&gt;&gt; You're like, no, I'm gonna\n\n643\n00:31:29.316 --> 00:31:29.842\nenable your account.\n\n644\n00:31:29.842 --> 00:31:31.005\nSo let's do that.\n\n645\n00:31:31.005 --> 00:31:36.327\nI guess we could run the opposite,\nthe usermod here, usermod.\n\n646\n00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:38.710\nLet's unlock Mike's account.\n\n647\n00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.450\n-u for unlock, and of course -e.\n\n648\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:47.247\nAnd if you remember before, it likes\nthis 99999 as basically like forever,\n\n649\n00:31:47.247 --> 00:31:48.228\nin Linux terms.\n\n650\n00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:53.990\nWe'll do that, 99999,\nlike that, and then mrodrick.\n\n651\n00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.630\nNow Mike's account should be unlocked.\n\n652\n00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.222\nOr if I had done the asterisk or\nthe nologin, I'd have to do visudo again,\n\n653\n00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.237\nor, visudo, I just love that.\n\n654\n00:32:04.237 --> 00:32:09.407\n[LAUGH] No, not visudo, vipw, or\nuse my editor of choice to just open\n\n655\n00:32:09.407 --> 00:32:15.690\nthe /etc/passwd file, P-A-S-S-W-D file,\nand make that modification.\n\n656\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.400\nSo keep those tricks in mind.\n\n657\n00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.870\nMike, I think this is a good spot for\nus to.\n\n658\n00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.250\nWe do have more on passwords.\n\n659\n00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.670\nBut we're going to get into\nwhat makes a good password.\n\n660\n00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.530\nHow can we control that our\nuser uses a good password?\n\n661\n00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.733\nAnd that is a whole can of worms,\nso I think it's a good spot for\n\n662\n00:32:35.733 --> 00:32:36.729\nus to take a break.\n\n663\n00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:38.338\nAnd then we'll do a part two.\n\n664\n00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:41.530\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a pan, plan then,\nif I can get that out of my mouth.\n\n665\n00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.830\nAll right, Daniel, that's what we'll do.\n\n666\n00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.538\nWe'll cut it here.\n\n667\n00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:44.371\nA lot of great information.\n\n668\n00:32:44.371 --> 00:32:47.670\nYou're getting used to,\none, creating accounts.\n\n669\n00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.570\nWe don't have to run\nas roots all the time.\n\n670\n00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.580\nLearning how to escalate our privileges\nwhen we're not logged on as roots.\n\n671\n00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.210\nSet up other users.\n\n672\n00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.793\nControl their account,\nwhether it's enabled or disabled,\n\n673\n00:32:56.793 --> 00:32:58.094\nwhether they can log in or not.\n\n674\n00:32:58.094 --> 00:32:59.860\nSo great information there.\n\n675\n00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.840\nMore to come, so make sure you stay tuned.\n\n676\n00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.100\nBut for now, signing off,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n677\n00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n678\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:13.520\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n679\n00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.890\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.420\nHello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.630\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing through\n\n6\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.360\nour GIAC Security,\nGSEC security fundamentals for short.\n\n7\n00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.020\nAnd joining is in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Dan Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.030\nDan, how we doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.680\nThank you for\nhaving me back in the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n12\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.180\n&gt;&gt; We kind of left our audience out\nthere with a bit of a cliff hanger and\n\n13\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.990\nI'm glad you're with me today as well.\n\n14\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.240\nI know we get the rotating a host here but\neverybody wanted a little piece\n\n15\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.030\nof this action-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.570\n&gt;&gt; So Mike was sharing the wealth when it\ncame to hosting, and we appreciate that.\n\n17\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.480\nThat being said, we need to just back into\nthese Linux configuration fundamentals.\n\n18\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.540\nRight, we, last episode we talked\na lot about creating user accounts,\n\n19\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.830\nsetting passwords for them.\n\n20\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.940\nAnd locking them out, and\nunlocking their accounts.\n\n21\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.850\nAnd now we need to get\ninto a bit of the mundane.\n\n22\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.570\nSomething that we'll be\ndoing on a regular basis.\n\n23\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.520\nI think we actually did talk about\nresetting the password using\n\n24\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.950\nthe PASSWD utility that's\nbuilt-in to the Linux systems.\n\n25\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150\nNow we need to get into authentication and\ncontrolling authentication a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.440\nThat's something that's\nextremely important,\n\n27\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.870\nbecause this is a bit of a security show.\n\n28\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.280\nAnd when you talk about security,\none of the base and\n\n29\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.290\nmain things that we use to secure our\nsystems is usernames and passwords.\n\n30\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.240\nThat's starting to get\nundermined a little bit but\n\n31\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.310\nit, they're still here for\nthe long haul, for quite a while.\n\n32\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.940\nI'm sure we'll continue to\nsee user names and passwords.\n\n33\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.490\nYour Linux system is\ngoing to be no different.\n\n34\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.800\nYou need to be able to configure it so\nthat it is a bit more secure than a,\n\n35\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.890\nwell most of them,\nthe distros come out of the box.\n\n36\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.940\nAlright, so that is what we're\ngoing to talk about today.\n\n37\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.200\nWays in which we can do that and\n\n38\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.065\nwhat equals good security versus not so\ngood security.\n\n39\n00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:57.670\nSo let's jump right in, let's talk\nabout modifying the password control.\n\n40\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.480\nSo okay so with Linux,\nevery time you use it,\n\n41\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.590\neverything it does is usually with\nsome sort of configuration file.\n\n42\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.030\nIf you want to configure something,\nthere are Wizards available but\n\n43\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.770\nthey are usually few and far between.\n\n44\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.420\nAnd since, as a Linux person, you bounce\nfrom one Linux distro to the other,\n\n45\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.930\nyou go with what's probably going to be\nthere, versus what might be there, right.\n\n46\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.610\nSo not that we don't learn cool wizard\nsystems and GUIs and graphics and\n\n47\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.710\nwe love it, it's great.\n\n48\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.620\nBut we tend to stick in the command line\nwhen it comes to administration just\n\n49\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.450\nbecause It's a little more ubiquitous,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.660\nAnd it seems to be that\nway across the board.\n\n51\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.500\nSo that's a good way to learn this.\n\n52\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Dan, one of the reasons\nI was thinking you would stay\n\n53\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300\nin the command prompt is\nreduce a tax surface, right?\n\n54\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.290\nWe're talking about\nsecurity to begin with.\n\n55\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.160\nWell what adds a little bit more\ninsecurity to any operating system is when\n\n56\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.020\nwe have to add on the additional stuff\nthat supports the graphical interface.\n\n57\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.410\nJust gives the attackers what, 50, 70,\n\n58\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.170\n100 different ways to get\ninto our operating system.\n\n59\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.250\nWe strip that off,\nwe just reduce it to the CLI, and\n\n60\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.860\nnow we don't have quite as big of a attack\nsurface as we do in our servers otherwise.\n\n61\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWell West makes a fantastic\n\n62\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.510\npoint, that's right.\n\n63\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.590\nIt could even be considered\na little bit of a security through\n\n64\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.340\nobscurity because most people don't\nknow Linux command line options, right.\n\n65\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.640\nThey're unfamiliar with it.\n\n66\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.830\nThey get greedy with a black box of text\nand they're, what do I do with this?\n\n67\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.410\nSo that can definitely work in our favor,\nespecially for this those kitties out\n\n68\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.520\nthere, the script kitties that's mainly\nwork and Windows based operating systems.\n\n69\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.450\nWe got a little extra buffer from\nat least those lower level attacks\n\n70\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.240\ncoming from them.\n\n71\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.780\nSo let's talk more about\nthe password controls.\n\n72\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.350\nLet's jump into that.\n\n73\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.989\nLet's take a look at the computer and\nsee where we can set these things.\n\n74\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.540\nAgain, I'm logged in as roots.\n\n75\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.130\nBecause I'm running this box,\nand I, it's a virtual machine and\n\n76\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.190\nI never created a user.\n\n77\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.310\nI know it's bad, bad, bad.\n\n78\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.624\n[NOISE] I smack the hand, right.\n\n79\n00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:51.167\nI shouldn't do that.\n\n80\n00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:52.280\nYou shouldn't do that.\n\n81\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.095\nCreate a user,\nI showed you how to do that.\n\n82\n00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:56.105\nLog in as that user.\n\n83\n00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:59.315\nI just never got around to doing it\nwith this so bad me, don't be like me.\n\n84\n00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:04.655\nDo as I do, do as I say not as I do and\nthat's why you see me logging in as root.\n\n85\n00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:09.305\nBut we're going to move into\nthe Etsy files for the directory and\n\n86\n00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:12.635\nwe're going to take a look at\na file called a login.defs.\n\n87\n00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:17.285\nSo if I just, I can either\nchange directory into cd /etc,\n\n88\n00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:21.130\nand then I'll probably list this.\n\n89\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.560\nUnless, we've got a few ways\nin which to look at files.\n\n90\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.910\nYou have cat, less, and more.\n\n91\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.030\nless is a little nicer, because you\ncan scroll up and down through it.\n\n92\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.910\nSo if you just type less then the name\nof the file which you'd like to look at.\n\n93\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.450\nThen it'll show the output here to the\nterminal, and it's gonna be login.defs.\n\n94\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.970\nAll right so we got login.defs, there's\na lot of configuration going on here, and\n\n95\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.540\nit's heavily commented,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n96\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.460\nWe like heavily commented\nconfiguration files,\n\n97\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.350\ncuz they let us know what's happening.\n\n98\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.590\nWe're only concerned for this episode\nabout the password portion specifically.\n\n99\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.300\nBut take a look through login.defs and\nsee what's in there.\n\n100\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.850\nPlay around with it.\n\n101\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.550\nLike I said it's heavily commented,\nit gives you a lot of information.\n\n102\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.860\nSo you shouldn't be out\nin the cold too much.\n\n103\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.820\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna type in a / and\n\n104\n00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.000\nthen I can type in a search string and\nthat will help us find that area.\n\n105\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.360\nIf I do password, it should take\nme right to the password area.\n\n106\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.208\nAnd the first thing we have in here,\nreally, there's very little control inside\n\n107\n00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:23.413\nof login.defs, that's just because\nwe have control elsewhere.\n\n108\n00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:26.250\nWe're going to talk about that\nin just a second, but right now,\n\n109\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.800\nI just wanted you to be\naware that this is here and\n\n110\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.060\nif you don't have what we're gonna\ntalk about in just a second.\n\n111\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.570\nWhich is called PAM structures\nthen you can fall back to this or\n\n112\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.730\nif something doesn't use a PAM,\nwhich is a plugable authentication module.\n\n113\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.780\nIt doesn't use that, it might fall\nback and use this login.defs for\n\n114\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.020\nany kind of authentication purposes.\n\n115\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.660\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n116\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.010\nSo we have password aging controls, and\nyes if I go up there it's more text,\n\n117\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.350\nbut it's not about passwords.\n\n118\n00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.130\nIt's only from here down, so\nthat made it really simple for us to see.\n\n119\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.740\nPassword aging controls,\nwe have past minimum days,\n\n120\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.580\nor sorry max days,\nminimum days, and warning age.\n\n121\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.100\nVery simple standard things in which we'd\n\n122\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.590\nlike to set when it\ncomes to our passwords.\n\n123\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.220\nHow long is this password good for?\n\n124\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.840\nHow long before I gotta\nchange the stinking thing?\n\n125\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.520\nAnd how long before my user gets\na warning that it's almost time to change\n\n126\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.600\nthe stinking thing?\n\n127\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.960\nSo that's basically what's going on here.\n\n128\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.650\nAnd you can see that from the heavily\ncommented section that says\n\n129\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.370\nhere are our options,\nwhere did my mouse go?\n\n130\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.180\nThere it is.\n\n131\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.420\nPass max days, maximum number of days\na password may be used, pass min days,\n\n132\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.810\nminimum number of days allowed between\npassword changes, and pass one h.\n\n133\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.580\nAnd then right below that, if you've\nnoticed, those things are uncommented with\n\n134\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.820\ntheir default values of 99,999, 0, and 7.\n\n135\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.570\nSo if we were to set the minimum\ndays to something and\n\n136\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.100\nthen that PASS_WARN_AGE\nwould come into play.\n\n137\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.160\nSo very simple, very good things for\nus to be able to, if we need to,\n\n138\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.030\nwe don't have PAM, then we can\nchange that stuff right in here.\n\n139\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.370\n&gt;&gt; One of the things you had told me,\nlooking at this screen here, Dan,\n\n140\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.170\nis that Linux comes\nwith a set of defaults.\n\n141\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.810\nLet me see if I can just kind of guess\nbecause you know I'm not really the Linux\n\n142\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.450\nguy more of a Windows guy here.\n\n143\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.920\nSo, your first pass maximum days\nlooks like it's infinite lifetime\n\n144\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.360\nif I understand that right.\n\n145\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.070\nIt looks like the minimum days you\ncan use that password is what zero,\n\n146\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.730\nthat means infinite lifetime.\n\n147\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.810\nYou don't have to change it.\n\n148\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.280\nAnd seven days, if you get to infinity,\nseven days prior to infinity,\n\n149\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.030\nyou're hitting that,\nyou're gonna have to change it.\n\n150\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.350\nSo other than that,\nyou really set the password.\n\n151\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.300\nIt seems like you set it and forget it.\n\n152\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.220\n&gt;&gt; Basically Wes is an honor\nroll student today.\n\n153\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.560\nHe has figured out the code.\n\n154\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.860\nHe's cracked it, it's that simple.\n\n155\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.390\nIt's just the default they're\ntrying to make it easy for you.\n\n156\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.814\nBut as a system administrator,\nsomeone's security-minded, right?\n\n157\n00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:49.476\nWe need to know about these things because\nif that's what it is then we've got users\n\n158\n00:07:49.476 --> 00:07:52.980\nout there using the same password for\ninfinity.\n\n159\n00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.322\nWhat's the worry there?\n\n160\n00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:56.882\nIs that someone may have intercepted and\n\n161\n00:07:56.882 --> 00:08:02.090\nit maybe even an encrypted password and\nare constantly working to crack it.\n\n162\n00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.020\nAnd we're gonna talk about what makes\na good password versus a bad password.\n\n163\n00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.980\nAnd if someone is using a bad password,\nthen that password is gonna be cracked and\n\n164\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.540\nthen ultimately used for compromise.\n\n165\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.980\nSo that's why things like this is\nsomething that we want to be aware of.\n\n166\n00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.700\nWhat are those defaults?\n\n167\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.740\nAnd obviously we should\nprobably go in here and\n\n168\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.970\ngive that a little bit of a change.\n\n169\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.110\nI'm going to leave this, this is\na virtual machine for demo purposes.\n\n170\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.710\nJust go in here, make it 40 days,\nmake it 60 days, whatever your\n\n171\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.160\npassword policy is for your company or for\nyourself if this is a personal system.\n\n172\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.300\nTrying to keep just security in mind,\nit's typically, and as we get in here in\n\n173\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.710\njust a second, if we set strong passwords,\nwe can go a little bit longer on the pass.\n\n174\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.110\nWe can go that 60 days,\n\n175\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.220\n70 days, maybe even 90 days because\nthe passwords are strong enough.\n\n176\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.180\nIt takes so long to crack them, by\nthe time the user changes their password,\n\n177\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.300\nthen their password is no good\nby the time it's been cracked.\n\n178\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.060\nSo that's we're talking about.\n\n179\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.470\nSo there we go, login.dev,\nit's very simple.\n\n180\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.710\nI do wanna show you\nan interesting portion here.\n\n181\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.470\nI think it's down here.\n\n182\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.950\nAnd yeah, login retries, how many\ntimes can my user attempt to login?\n\n183\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.998\nSay I fat-finger my password, I mistype\nit, gives me another try, right, and\n\n184\n00:09:12.998 --> 00:09:14.260\nit gives me another try.\n\n185\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.410\nHow many tries is that?\n\n186\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.240\nThere's the default of five tries,\nagain, goes into.\n\n187\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.360\nNow this is interesting right\nhere with the comments,\n\n188\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.940\nmax number of login retries\nif password is bad.\n\n189\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.170\nThis will most likely\nbe overwritten by PAM.\n\n190\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.040\nThat's true, since the default PAM Unix\nmodule has it's own built-in of\n\n191\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.290\nthree retries.\n\n192\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.400\nSo PAM's a little more robust, but\nagain, if PAM is not there for\n\n193\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.570\nwhatever it is you're trying to\nlog into does not use a PAM module\n\n194\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.770\nthen it will to default to login.dev's.\n\n195\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.700\nSo let's talk about PAM, pluggable\nauthentication modules, if you were.\n\n196\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.350\nAnd there is a wonderful directory with\nPAM's stuff inside of our systems,\n\n197\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.867\nit's Pam.d.\n\n198\n00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:57.680\nSo you know what?\n\n199\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.020\nLet's go there now.\n\n200\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.390\nThat looks like a good idea for me.\n\n201\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.910\nBack to the computer, here we go.\n\n202\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.330\nTo quit out of Les,\nyou can't just get to the end.\n\n203\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.100\nIf I just page all the way down,\nYou notice it just says end.\n\n204\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.676\nGet out of that,\njust press the q button for quit.\n\n205\n00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.230\nThere we go.\n\n206\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.920\nThat takes us out, back to our prompt.\n\n207\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo let me change directory.\n\n208\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.400\nI'm already in.\nThis is where,\n\n209\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.340\nthis is the \"write it\ndown\" portion of the show.\n\n210\n00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.640\nThe Pam.D and the PAM configurations\nare going to be in /etsy/pam.d.\n\n211\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.370\nAnd then there's going to be some stuff\nin there that we want to take a look at.\n\n212\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:29.960\nSo let's do that.\n\n213\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.330\nSo I'm already in Etsy, so I just need to\nchange directory to PAM, if I can pam.d.\n\n214\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:36.890\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.410\nIf I do a LS, I've got a few PAM\nmodules already in my system.\n\n216\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.750\nThese, these were the defaults,\njust came the, just came with car.\n\n217\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.480\nRight, so don't blame me for any of it.\n\n218\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.240\nThe one we're specifically worried\nabout is this guy right here.\n\n219\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.830\nCommon dash password.\n\n220\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.530\nAnd what's interesting is there\nis password, there's login,\n\n221\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.700\nI think a couple of others.\n\n222\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.800\nYou think shouldn't that be where I go?\n\n223\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.210\nLet's take a look what's in password.\n\n224\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.550\nJust for grins.\n\n225\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.480\nAnd I know it's a short file,\nso I can just cap that.\n\n226\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.180\nYou'll notice it says that\nthe PAM configuration file for\n\n227\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.570\nthe shadow password service, that\nseems good, include a common password.\n\n228\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.920\nSo common password is basically doing\nall these services inside of itself.\n\n229\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.770\nSo it's letting you know\nthat that is there.\n\n230\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.390\nSo that's why we want to play\naround with common password.\n\n231\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.660\nLet's take a look at\nwhat's in common password.\n\n232\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.390\nI will less common password here.\n\n233\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.530\nThere we go.\nAgain, heavily commented and\n\n234\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.140\nwe like heavily commented.\n\n235\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.540\nPlease read this material if you are\nmaking modifications to an actual system\n\n236\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.370\nthat means something to you,\n\n237\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.120\nbecause it's gonna help you understand\na little bit more about how this works.\n\n238\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.650\nBut I'm gonna scroll down a little bit.\n\n239\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.150\nAnd there are a few entries already\nin here that come as default.\n\n240\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.940\nWe're gonna talk about making\nchanges those entries or\n\n241\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.000\nadding entries later in just a second.\n\n242\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.080\nBut here is basically what we're working\nwith right here, that's the money.\n\n243\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.570\nThat is the main PAM module for\n\n244\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:18.160\nthis on how PAM is handling\nauthentication when you use a password.\n\n245\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.250\nSo very simple, that's what we're\nlooking at, that's what we're doing.\n\n246\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.480\nSo it's saying that there\nis a password module.\n\n247\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.300\nSuccess equals one,\nkind of like were they successful?\n\n248\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.990\nIf not, just ignore, this is the default.\n\n249\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.504\nAnd then you've got this pam_unix.so,\n\n250\n00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:39.610\nwhich is the main PAM module for\nauthentication.\n\n251\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.790\nSo very important.\n\n252\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.576\nThat is the one you want.\n\n253\n00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:45.100\nThen you've got this obscure and shot 512,\n\n254\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.400\nbasically some extra functionality\nthat they've added on top of just.\n\n255\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.050\nYou could go in here and\ntake the obscure and shot 512 stuff off.\n\n256\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.460\nAnd this would still work in\ntheory as long as it's not\n\n257\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.260\ncompletely dependent on it in some ways\n[INAUDIBLE] that we don't know about.\n\n258\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.720\nBut I've seen it\n\n259\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.620\nmore truncated that what you're\nseeing because this is add-on stuff.\n\n260\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.740\nAnd we can add to this ourselves.\n\n261\n00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.090\nWe can do things like how many\npasswords should it remember.\n\n262\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.271\nHow many times can you reuse a password?\n\n263\n00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:18.990\nWhat else can we do?\n\n264\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.330\nHow long should it be?\n\n265\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.480\nWhat's the minimum length, and\nother forms of control such as that.\n\n266\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.730\nSo that's what it's all about.\n\n267\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.070\nHow can we control the user's experience\nwhen they create a password to\n\n268\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.050\nmake sure that the password they create is\ngoing to be something that's secure and\n\n269\n00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.750\ngood for our company, or our system, or\nour environment, whatever the case is.\n\n270\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.920\nSo what do we do again?\n\n271\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.040\nIt's a flat file.\n\n272\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.160\nWe're just reading it right now.\n\n273\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.470\nI can queue out of there.\n\n274\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:50.850\nI can use my editor of choice and\nCallie and other modern Linux systems.\n\n275\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.840\nI like to use Nano just because\nit's a little bit easier,\n\n276\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.410\nespecially if you are new to Linux.\n\n277\n00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.890\nI would recommend, though,\nlearning [INAUDIBLE].\n\n278\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.620\nIt will, I have logged into systems,\neven modern systems,\n\n279\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.680\nthe only editor and it's like a headless\nsystem, you are just give it a command\n\n280\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.990\nprompt, you get no graphics whatsoever the\nonly editor and it would be vi usually.\n\n281\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.860\nSo vi is usually around.\n\n282\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.850\nThis is why I say learn vi.\n\n283\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.100\nThis is not a show about using vi,\nit's not a show about using nano.\n\n284\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.700\nBut nano is built into my system and nano\nis great, so if you've got nano, great.\n\n285\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.830\nIf not, you'll have to use vi for\nthis or something else.\n\n286\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:35.250\nSo I'm going to nano common -password\nlike so and now I'm in the file.\n\n287\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.750\nIf I was not logged in as root,\nwe are in a protected area.\n\n288\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.000\nI'm sure if we looked at the file itself,\n\n289\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.750\nit would be controlled with permissions\nwhich we will do in another show.\n\n290\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.990\nWe'll look at file permissions and\nthings of that nature that would\n\n291\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.640\nnot allow standard users to\nlog into this or make changes.\n\n292\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.610\nSo you would need to pseudo or\nsudo however you like to say it\n\n293\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.300\nbefore you run your text editors\nthat you have permissions to do so.\n\n294\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.010\nAll right, so if we go down to here,\nwe scroll down a bit.\n\n295\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.750\nI can do things.\n\n296\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.660\nAnd like I said, it's just as\nsimple as appending to the file.\n\n297\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.730\nI could come in here.\n\n298\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.560\nI'll do it here, so\n\n299\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.880\nyou can see it a little better, I don't\ncare if obscure moves out of our way.\n\n300\n00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.970\nSo we can do things like, let's see here.\n\n301\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.020\nRemember = 6.\n\n302\n00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.260\nSo if I want to remember\nthe last six passwords.\n\n303\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.189\nSo you gotta use a new password at\nleast six times before you can reuse\n\n304\n00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:24.842\nthat first password.\n\n305\n00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:27.060\nThat's always a good way to go.\n\n306\n00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.420\nAnd things like like I said before,\nminLength.\n\n307\n00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.440\nIs it minLen?\n\n308\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.320\nYeah, minLen.\n\n309\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.630\nEquals and we'll say the minimum length,\nwe'll be nice and say eight.\n\n310\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.820\nSo just as simple as that.\n\n311\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.980\nIf I now save this file and\nclose this file, that's it.\n\n312\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.570\nAnything that tries to\nauthenticate will use this.\n\n313\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.550\nI'm not sure if have to\nrestart any services.\n\n314\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.290\nI don't think so.\n\n315\n00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.250\nBut if you do, you do right.\n\n316\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.010\nYou just re-start.\n\n317\n00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.747\nIf you don't, I don't know what\nit is off the top of my head so\n\n318\n00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:55.892\nre-start this system.\n\n319\n00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:58.220\nYeah, it's going down everybody,\nI made some changes.\n\n320\n00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.919\nIt's in for fun and games,\nright, always a good time.\n\n321\n00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.090\nBut like I said, that simple.\n\n322\n00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.474\nVery easy, go in, remember = 6 and\nyou're like okay, that's cool.\n\n323\n00:16:08.474 --> 00:16:12.160\nBut how do I know what those options are?\n\n324\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.501\nWell, those are some of the built in ones\nand you can just Google search a list.\n\n325\n00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:20.190\nAnd again, this isn't a full\nfledged How to, from soup to nuts,\n\n326\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.910\nsecure your password.\n\n327\n00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.680\nI'm just giving you the tools so\nthat you understand the concepts and\n\n328\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.160\nthe tools that are used behind that.\n\n329\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.890\nBecause it's beyond\nthe scope of this course.\n\n330\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Dan, looking up here at your\ncurry machine that you have,\n\n331\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.750\nif I'm saying that right.\n\n332\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.930\nI know that that is a derivative or\na flavor of Debian, so\n\n333\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.890\nI can only imagine that this was\nworking Debian or Debian as well.\n\n334\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.620\nIs it gonna be the same path, and\n\n335\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.150\ndo we have this option Two for\nother distros inside of the Linux world?\n\n336\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for reminding me.\n\n337\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.676\nThat's actually a good point.\n\n338\n00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:51.543\nYou might not be running a Debian variant,\nor Ubuntu, or\n\n339\n00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:54.340\nsomething that came from\na Debian fork world.\n\n340\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.118\nYou might be going Red Hat level, right?\n\n341\n00:16:56.118 --> 00:16:58.731\nThe file system just a bit different.\n\n342\n00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:03.620\nEverything is exactly the same except for\nthe name of the file itself.\n\n343\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.364\nSo in Debian, we've got common-password,\nand Red Hat, I wrote it down,\n\n344\n00:17:08.364 --> 00:17:14.099\ncuz I won't remember, cuz I don't have\nthat much, system-auth, A-U-T-H, right?\n\n345\n00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:20.210\nSo system-auth, so\nit will be EtsyPam.D/system-auth.\n\n346\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:26.190\nSo just remember that, the files will look\nvery similar you'll see those strings of,\n\n347\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.200\nwhere it has password requirement and\npam_unix.so.\n\n348\n00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.790\nThat will all be in there, and\n\n349\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.410\nyou'll just have to modify it\njust like what we're doing here.\n\n350\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.352\nAll the other stuff we're doing Will work,\nbecause the files are basically the same,\n\n351\n00:17:38.352 --> 00:17:41.222\nthey're just named differently\nbetween the distributions.\n\n352\n00:17:41.222 --> 00:17:44.521\n&gt;&gt; And on that same line of thinking,\nthere, so if it's Red Hat,\n\n353\n00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.220\nam I understanding this right?\n\n354\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.910\nThat that would also be\nthe same in Sento and Fedora?\n\n355\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.030\nCuz I believe all those families\nare sitting in the same baskets of\n\n356\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.380\npretty close to the same thing there?\n\n357\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n358\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.520\nremember we talked about that before,\nin I think it was our very first show,\n\n359\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.428\nthe difference between the distros\n&gt;&gt; When you are talking Red Hat,\n\n360\n00:18:00.428 --> 00:18:01.559\nyou've got Red Hat in Linux.\n\n361\n00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:04.394\nYou've got Sentro OS or Sentos.\n\n362\n00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:09.350\nThere's five, six, six fives, seven,\na bunch of great distros for that.\n\n363\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.768\nAnd fedora,\nthe bleeding edge of Red Hat systems.\n\n364\n00:18:12.768 --> 00:18:16.060\nSo if you're running one of those,\nthat is where those will be.\n\n365\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.970\nGood catch there Mister Wesley\nwe appreciate that.\n\n366\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.830\nAll right, let's talk about extending\nthe capabilities of our Pam, okay.\n\n367\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.860\nGiving it a little more functionality.\n\n368\n00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:31.790\nLet me quit out of here,\nI'm just gonna exit and, if I can do that.\n\n369\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.102\nThere we go, yeah,\nI do want to discard those changes.\n\n370\n00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:35.855\nI'm not making any changes\nto my system right now.\n\n371\n00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:39.120\nWe get locked out in\nthe middle of our show.\n\n372\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.577\nSo we can download some extra, and\n\n373\n00:18:41.577 --> 00:18:47.193\nlet's talk about pluggable authentication\nmodels for just a moment in time.\n\n374\n00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:51.250\nThink about that terminology,\npluggable authentication module.\n\n375\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.350\nSo it's, plug, you're pushing it in.\n\n376\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.490\nAnd the module, you think of\na module as something that adds on.\n\n377\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.909\nSo we're basically bolting\non authentication.\n\n378\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.930\nOr authentication capabilities,\nshould I say.\n\n379\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.550\nRight that's a better way of putting it.\n\n380\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.004\nSo we're bolting,\nI wanna add some functionality to it.\n\n381\n00:19:08.004 --> 00:19:11.567\nIt's like if you get a car and\nit's got 90 horsepower and\n\n382\n00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.920\nI plug in a super charger or\na turbo, or nitrous oxide.\n\n383\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.715\nAnd it's 100 horsepower.\n\n384\n00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:20.578\nI've bolted an I've plugged in an extra\n100 horse with more capabilities,\n\n385\n00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:21.510\nsame kind of idea.\n\n386\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.690\nWe're gonna extend the capabilities\nof our password changing system.\n\n387\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.310\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting, you think cars and\n\n388\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.390\nI'm sitting here thinking\nnetworks on the back panel.\n\n389\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.530\nI'm thinking of the small\nformable plugins, right,\n\n390\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.470\nthat the SFPs,\nif I can remember that right.\n\n391\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.570\nI need fiber optic to\ncopper media conversion.\n\n392\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.690\nI don't have the functionality.\n\n393\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.562\nWhat do I got to do?\nI've got this pluggable module\n\n394\n00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:45.631\nthat I can add in to it and it brings\nthat functionality that otherwise,\n\n395\n00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:47.760\nwithout that module, I just wouldn't have.\n\n396\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n397\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.400\nAnd since we don't have\nall of them by default,\n\n398\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.340\nwe need to take a look at how we\ncan search for other modules and\n\n399\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.380\nthen how to get them installed so\nthat we can use them.\n\n400\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.948\nSo that is what we're gonna do.\n\n401\n00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:01.910\nGive you a little taste of that.\n\n402\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:06.740\nSo the first thing we need to understand\nis our app get system, we love it,\n\n403\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.368\nit's great, it's easy, it's super easy.\n\n404\n00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:11.395\nI'm not gonna get into the ins and\nouts of that right this second.\n\n405\n00:20:11.395 --> 00:20:15.478\nBut you'll see how simple it\nis as we walk through here.\n\n406\n00:20:15.478 --> 00:20:21.030\nBasically we're gonna look at a repository\nof things that we can download for\n\n407\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.050\nour systems and\n\n408\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.030\nsee if there's anything that goes towards\nPAM that we might be able to use.\n\n409\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.700\nSo what we can do is, I don't need\nDesudu because I am logged in as root.\n\n410\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.030\nBut if you're not, remember Desudu.\n\n411\n00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.503\nI will do apt-cash, like so.\n\n412\n00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:44.110\nDo search and the look for\nlib pam- like that, right?\n\n413\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.750\nHit Return and woah there we go.\n\n414\n00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.485\nPlenty of extra functionality that\nwe can put into our systems that\n\n415\n00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:53.980\nare at our leisure, all we'd have\nto do is go man, that looks great.\n\n416\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.980\nI would like that.\nAnd then we'd install it.\n\n417\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.490\nSpecifically, for us,\nwe're looking at password stuff.\n\n418\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:04.696\nSo there are two main\npassword configuration\n\n419\n00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:09.960\nin pams that you probably wanna grab and\ninstall for your system.\n\n420\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.060\nThe first one is let's scroll up here.\n\n421\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.940\nSee if I can find these\nguys here a little, yeah,\n\n422\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.751\nfirst of all I'm gonna start with C,\nthere it is, right there.\n\n423\n00:21:18.751 --> 00:21:25.550\nLibpam-cracklib which is a PAM\nmodule to enable cracklib support.\n\n424\n00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.820\nWell, that's very helpful, thank you for\n\n425\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.870\nthat description,\npeople at this repository.\n\n426\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.960\nBasically it is checking to see how, it\n\n427\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.670\ngives you functionality to make sure that\nyour passwords are not easily cracked.\n\n428\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.037\nHence cracklib, right?\n\n429\n00:21:40.037 --> 00:21:44.260\nThere is also another one I\nthink it is a p something.\n\n430\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.690\nWhoop, there we go, let's see here.\n\n431\n00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.150\nWe're almost there, cuz I'm right here.\n\n432\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:53.473\nHere we go, libpam P Quality,\nwhat are PW quality, yeah.\n\n433\n00:21:53.473 --> 00:21:57.202\nPW quality,\nwhat is the quality of your password and\n\n434\n00:21:57.202 --> 00:22:02.510\ncan we increase that using these pam\nmodules to check password strength.\n\n435\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.560\nSo you get these two power combined,\nI think you can really go with one or\n\n436\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.420\nthe other to be honest with you.\n\n437\n00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.086\nThey both basically kind\nof do the same thing.\n\n438\n00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:11.510\nIt's just if you like\none versus the other.\n\n439\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.300\nOr one has that little bit of extra\nthat the other one doesn't have.\n\n440\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.730\nThen you might want to go with one or\nthe other.\n\n441\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.871\nPick your poison and go forth,\nyoung man or woman, and install.\n\n442\n00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:23.910\nHow do we do that?\n\n443\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.600\nWell, that's a good question.\n\n444\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:32.350\nSo, back to our apt get stuff, we're\njust gonna say apt dash get install and\n\n445\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:38.091\nthen it will be libpam-cracklib,\nlike that, right?\n\n446\n00:22:38.091 --> 00:22:42.162\nSo apt get install, so\nwe're install something, and\n\n447\n00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:46.069\nthen whatever the libpam\nmodule it is that you want.\n\n448\n00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:49.360\nType in the full name and hit Enter.\n\n449\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.240\nAnd Enter, off we go,\n\n450\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.520\nit's gonna maybe ask us if we really\nwish to do this kind of thing.\n\n451\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.820\nSo typically we get that stuff.\n\n452\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.652\nBut it looks like it's going.\n\n453\n00:22:57.652 --> 00:23:00.700\nIt says setting up libpam so\nwe're basically in the waiting game,\n\n454\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.920\njust waiting for it to complete.\n\n455\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.920\nGreat thing about AppGet is it does\nall the dependencies and everything.\n\n456\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.136\nYou don't have to go out and find\neverything in the sun that you need to get\n\n457\n00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:12.380\nthat install in your system, the app\ngets system should do that for you.\n\n458\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.000\nThank you package people.\n\n459\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.453\nYeah you're descriptions weren't great but\nyou did the whole thing so\n\n460\n00:23:17.453 --> 00:23:18.600\nwe'll overlook it, so.\n\n461\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.013\nWe could also do the PW quality and I'm\nnot gonna mess with that, you understand,\n\n462\n00:23:22.013 --> 00:23:23.807\nyou get the idea that's what's going on.\n\n463\n00:23:23.807 --> 00:23:28.460\nAnd from there we'll be able to\nadd mode lines to the system.\n\n464\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.910\nWe've added that functionality\nbecause we now have that library,\n\n465\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.200\nthat module library inside of our system.\n\n466\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.295\nSo let's take a look at cracklib, and\n\n467\n00:23:36.295 --> 00:23:40.330\nthe cool thing is the manual\npages tell you all about it.\n\n468\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.463\nI love those manual pages, they're so\nfull of great information.\n\n469\n00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:45.748\nYes they can be dry and boring.\n\n470\n00:23:45.748 --> 00:23:47.625\nBut the info is actually in there.\n\n471\n00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:49.293\nSo that's probably where you wanna go.\n\n472\n00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:50.249\nSo let's do that.\n\n473\n00:23:50.249 --> 00:23:57.302\nMan for manual, and\nthen pan_cracklib Like so.\n\n474\n00:23:57.302 --> 00:24:04.148\nIf we were to have done the pwqualitive,\npam_pwquality, so on and so forth.\n\n475\n00:24:04.148 --> 00:24:08.236\nThere we go, pam crack lib, and\nif we scroll through here, yeah,\n\n476\n00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:11.680\nthis gives you a short\ndescription of what's going on.\n\n477\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.190\nAnd if we call through here,\nI'm gonna show you, here we go.\n\n478\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.535\nSo we start getting some, these are our\noptions that we can add to our,\n\n479\n00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:26.707\nthis stupid, what's the, common\npassword couldn't think of the name.\n\n480\n00:24:26.707 --> 00:24:29.045\n[LAUGH] The common password file.\n\n481\n00:24:29.045 --> 00:24:32.610\nRetries, I like this one, difok,\n\n482\n00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.390\nthis argument will change the default\nof five for the number of\n\n483\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:40.350\ncharacter changes in the new password that\ndifferentiate it from the old password.\n\n484\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.200\nRight?\nSo how different is the new password have\n\n485\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.120\nto be from the old password kind of thing,\nright.\n\n486\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.900\nThe minimum length there we like that.\n\n487\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.640\nWe already used that one\nbecause it was built in.\n\n488\n00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.370\nDcredits, if you have\nless than a blank digits.\n\n489\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.000\nRight, so you have to have a certain\namount of numbers in your password.\n\n490\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.637\nSo if I wanted to add that functionality,\nyou have to have a least one password,\n\n491\n00:25:03.637 --> 00:25:06.156\none uppercase character,\none lowercase character.\n\n492\n00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:11.150\nAnd it has to be at least x\namount of characters long.\n\n493\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.990\nThat's the kind of thing\nwe're looking at right here.\n\n494\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.320\nAnd this is where you find\nout what do I have to choose,\n\n495\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.210\nwhat is the option that I need to type in,\nwhat's the syntax for that?\n\n496\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.960\nSo that I can make that happen in\nsome of my common desk password\n\n497\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.620\nof my the auth file,\nthe system desk auth file.\n\n498\n00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.920\nAll right, that's where you'll find these.\n\n499\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.480\nYou'll notice that all say something like\nuCredit equals N, so what is uCredit?\n\n500\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.090\nIt is the maximum credit for having\nuppercase letters and the new password.\n\n501\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.880\nSo if you wanna have at least one,\nyou make ucredit equals 1, and\n\n502\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.070\nthen they have to have at least one upper\ncase character in their password for\n\n503\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.860\nit to be accepted by the system.\n\n504\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.695\nThat's what we're doing, very much,\nyou can scroll through these,\n\n505\n00:25:52.695 --> 00:25:55.528\nlike I said it's a very informative file,\nit's gonna have a lot of good\n\n506\n00:25:55.528 --> 00:25:57.958\ninformation on setting that stuff so\nplay around with that.\n\n507\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:02.200\nGo credit, minimum class, maximum repeat,\nreject passwords that contain\n\n508\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.840\nmore than the same end number\nof consecutive characters.\n\n509\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.020\nYou get the idea, very,\nvery straightforward.\n\n510\n00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.650\nAll right,\nnow that we understand how to actually\n\n511\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:18.130\nput controls on our passwords for\nour users and even ourselves.\n\n512\n00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.460\nLet's talk about what\nmakes a good password.\n\n513\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.290\nThat's where we wanna go.\n\n514\n00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.250\nOkay, I know how to make the changes now.\n\n515\n00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.860\nI've got a good idea of where to go and\nI know the file I need to edit.\n\n516\n00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.230\nI've got the PAM module installed,\nI've looked at the files so\n\n517\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.230\nthat I know exactly how to use\nthe syntax to configure it correctly.\n\n518\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.690\nWe've looked at putting that\nsyntax into the file itself.\n\n519\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.850\nNow, how do I make this strong?\n\n520\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.830\nHow do I make this to where my\nusers create a password, what is\n\n521\n00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.840\nthe definitions that I'm gonna use, the\ncontrols in place that I'm gonna set for\n\n522\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.860\nthem so\nthat they always make a strong password?\n\n523\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.720\nWhat would that be?\n\n524\n00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.219\nThat's what we wanna talk about, and\nthat's the last little bit of this.\n\n525\n00:26:54.219 --> 00:26:57.061\nAnd then we're gonna have to actually\nhave to do another part cuz,\n\n526\n00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:59.790\nI'm running out of time\nhere really quickly.\n\n527\n00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.770\nSo let's see here.\n\n528\n00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.332\nOnly a, make sure I get my note,\nmy page and my notes were I get,\n\n529\n00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:07.950\ndon't forget anything I\nwant you guys to know.\n\n530\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.970\nSufficient password length\nis where I like to start.\n\n531\n00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.010\nIf the password is long enough, if you\ngive it enough characters, it will take so\n\n532\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.604\nlong for someone to crack it\nusing a cracking technique,\n\n533\n00:27:20.604 --> 00:27:25.480\nlike a Brute-force cracking\ntechnique that it will be.\n\n534\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.360\nIt will be, they will be dead.\n\n535\n00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.126\nIt will take forever.\n\n536\n00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:30.282\nPeople will be long gone.\n\n537\n00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:34.424\nCivilizations will have come and gone,\nand that computer if it's still around,\n\n538\n00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:38.160\nwill still be sitting there working\nat that password and not cracking it.\n\n539\n00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.920\nWhat is that number?\n\n540\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.992\nHow long does that password have to be?\n\n541\n00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:46.996\nI would say, I typically like,\nfor myself, for\n\n542\n00:27:46.996 --> 00:27:52.090\nmy personal safety I like at\nleast 15 character passwords.\n\n543\n00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:52.700\nI know, I know.\n\n544\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.470\nIt hurt.\n\n545\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.290\nIt felt bad.\n\n546\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.280\nThe guts, right.\n\n547\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.330\nYou were kicked right there\nin the lower regions and\n\n548\n00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.220\nthe wind got knocked out of you.\n\n549\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.240\n15 characters.\n\n550\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.150\nYou're out of your mind.\n\n551\n00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.260\nYeah, I might be out of my mind,\nbut it's a safe password.\n\n552\n00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.554\nOkay?\nIt's a very safe password that's 15\n\n553\n00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:08.920\ncharacters in length.\n\n554\n00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.860\nTypically, though, you take a security\nclass, much like what you're doing\n\n555\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.520\nright now, they will recommend a minimum\nof eight characters in length.\n\n556\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.924\nBecause that makes it at least long enough\nto where a brute force will probably not\n\n557\n00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:24.774\ninterfere, with like what\nwe talked about before,\n\n558\n00:28:24.774 --> 00:28:28.169\nif you have 40 days before you\nhave to change your password.\n\n559\n00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:32.430\nEight character might give you enough time\nbefore someone grabbed that password.\n\n560\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.090\nThey wouldn't be able to brute force\nthrough it before that changed.\n\n561\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.570\nYou can still probably do it though.\n\n562\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.747\nYou don't have a great chance and\nthat's why I like to go higher.\n\n563\n00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:47.580\nTwelve is better,\ntwelve is much better, right?\n\n564\n00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.866\nThat's kind of a happy medium.\n\n565\n00:28:48.866 --> 00:28:51.900\nLet's be honest people,\neight characters is nothing, right?\n\n566\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.410\nIf you can't come up with\nan eight character password,\n\n567\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.210\nthe creativity levels in you are very low,\nright?\n\n568\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.710\nThis should be very simple to create an\neight character password, something that\n\n569\n00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.880\nyou can remember and use, not write on\na sticky note and tape it to your monitor.\n\n570\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.270\nAnd yes that's the argumentation that\ncomes back my way, it's so long,\n\n571\n00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.160\nit's hard to remember.\n\n572\n00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.960\nAll right?\nI can't remember that.\n\n573\n00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.500\nThat's why I always suggest using\npassphrases instead of passwords.\n\n574\n00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.471\nYes, pass words are difficult to find.\n\n575\n00:29:20.471 --> 00:29:23.420\nI can't use\nsupercalifragialisticextrialidosis, right?\n\n576\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.055\nThat's just ridiculous.\n\n577\n00:29:24.055 --> 00:29:28.020\nEven though you might remember that,\nto be honest with you.\n\n578\n00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.350\nBut finding word xylophone, or whatever,\nthat's going to be of sufficient length\n\n579\n00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.040\nto be a good password that's\nreally not gonna help.\n\n580\n00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.960\nYou can help that by adding\nthings like numbers to it.\n\n581\n00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.260\nSo it can increase the length,\nbut it doesn't increase\n\n582\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.780\nthe amount of time that it would\ntake to crack that password, right.\n\n583\n00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.230\nSo just using lowercase characters of\nA through Z of sufficient length 12 and\n\n584\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.139\nabove is what I recommend.\n\n585\n00:29:54.139 --> 00:29:56.896\nLike I said, typically courses like this,\n\n586\n00:29:56.896 --> 00:30:00.110\nthey tell you at he very\nminimum eight characters.\n\n587\n00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.762\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n588\n00:30:00.762 --> 00:30:05.773\nSufficient length,\nbrute force attacks are out the door.\n\n589\n00:30:05.773 --> 00:30:09.010\nWhat it doesn't protect you from\nis dictionary text, all right?\n\n590\n00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.211\nSo there's two types of password attacks\nthere, we've got the dictionary and\n\n591\n00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:12.936\nthe brute force.\n\n592\n00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:14.556\nBrute force is try A.\n\n593\n00:30:14.556 --> 00:30:16.129\nOkay, it's not A, try AA.\n\n594\n00:30:16.129 --> 00:30:20.767\nOkay, it's not AA, try AAA and\ncontinuing I try B, try BB, try BBB.\n\n595\n00:30:20.767 --> 00:30:23.288\nUntil you give a parameters\non what you want it to try,\n\n596\n00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:27.510\nas far as your brute force goes, and\nit just tries every possible combination.\n\n597\n00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.130\nDictionary attack is different.\n\n598\n00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.250\nA dictionary attack has a file,\nwith a bunch of words in it.\n\n599\n00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.090\nAnd commonly used passwords\nthat you've gathered and\n\n600\n00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.905\nlooked at over your course\nas an administrator.\n\n601\n00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:42.864\nAnd you just put it in a flat file and\nyou say look through this file.\n\n602\n00:30:42.864 --> 00:30:46.700\nTry every one of these words in this file,\nand see if any of them work.\n\n603\n00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.610\nSo I could have a password of 300\ncharacters, if it's in that file,\n\n604\n00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.480\nmy passwords getting cracked.\n\n605\n00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.975\nSo you've got to remember when it comes\nto dictionary attacks, sufficient length,\n\n606\n00:30:57.975 --> 00:31:03.168\nwhile great against brute force is not a\nguarantee against a dictionary if you use\n\n607\n00:31:03.168 --> 00:31:08.237\nsomething stupid that is going to easily\nbe disseminated by a bad actor right.\n\n608\n00:31:08.237 --> 00:31:10.040\nSo that's what you want to keep in mind.\n\n609\n00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.666\nSo typically we try to combine\nthe techniques to make a strong password.\n\n610\n00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:19.765\nWe want good, sufficient length, and\nwe want to use things like uppercase and\n\n611\n00:31:19.765 --> 00:31:24.010\nlowercase, add numbers into it,\nand special characters.\n\n612\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.280\nThis keeps dictionary attacks\nfrom working against it.\n\n613\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.209\nAnd if it's sufficiently long,\nthen it's too long for\n\n614\n00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:35.568\na password cracker in any reasonable\namount of time to crack said password.\n\n615\n00:31:35.568 --> 00:31:41.890\nSo, let's see here, I also want to show\nyou a really quick, a really cool thing.\n\n616\n00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.430\nThere's an Excel spreadsheet\nyou can download.\n\n617\n00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.214\nIt's called,\nI don't know if the company's Mandylion.\n\n618\n00:31:47.214 --> 00:31:50.036\nLet's just take a look at it,\nI think it's in, here we go.\n\n619\n00:31:50.036 --> 00:31:55.756\nExcel Spreadsheet, it is Mandylion\nResearch Labs and you can kind of.\n\n620\n00:31:55.756 --> 00:32:00.199\nFigure out how long it will take\ngiven a set of characters, for\n\n621\n00:32:00.199 --> 00:32:03.810\na password cracker to crack the password.\n\n622\n00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.650\nSo if I look at lowercase\nletters right here.\n\n623\n00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:11.610\nAnd I say, let's make it eight\ncharacters right, the minimum.\n\n624\n00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.810\nHit Enter.\n\n625\n00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.510\nYou'll come over here if you can,\nyou see that right there?\n\n626\n00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.310\nYou can't really see this over here.\n\n627\n00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.420\nBecause, there we go.\n\n628\n00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.730\nI'll tell.\n6.8 hours.\n\n629\n00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.240\nSo using just lowercase letters, and\n\n630\n00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.430\neight character password would\nbe cracked in about six hours.\n\n631\n00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.620\nThat's not very long, but\nif we bumped that up.\n\n632\n00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.119\nLet's see what happens\nif we change that to 12.\n\n633\n00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.270\nNow all of a sudden it's\na little different.\n\n634\n00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.530\nNow you see why I'm a proponent\nof longer passwords.\n\n635\n00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:45.270\nJust using lowercase, we are now pushing\nthat to many more hours than six.\n\n636\n00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.600\nThat's a lot of hours, right?\n\n637\n00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.860\nThat's 2 million hours, almost 3,\nso 2 and two-thirds million hours.\n\n638\n00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.370\nThat's a lot of time that it would take.\n\n639\n00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.710\nStill possible though, right?\n\n640\n00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.850\nLet's do like I do.\n\n641\n00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.200\nI like at least 15, let's try that one.\n\n642\n00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.230\nLet's see, 15, enter.\n\n643\n00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.580\nYeah, you see cuz it exponentially rises.\n\n644\n00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.031\nI know, we're running out of time.\n\n645\n00:33:06.031 --> 00:33:13.370\nLet's add at least one upper case\ncharacter and at least one number.\n\n646\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.900\nAnd now, it's infinite amount of time.\n\n647\n00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.840\nIt can't even put it in the spreadsheet.\n\n648\n00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.370\nThat's how long it takes.\n\n649\n00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.710\nSo we have sufficient length.\n\n650\n00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.340\nHave a little bit of\nspice to make it nice.\n\n651\n00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:29.090\nIt's kinda just be too much for\nany password cracker to handle.\n\n652\n00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.339\nAnd that should take care of it.\n\n653\n00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:34.270\nI was like to recommend as\nin creating a password.\n\n654\n00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:38.300\nDo something like two random\nwords separated by a number.\n\n655\n00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.690\nDon't put the number at the end or\nthe beginning,\n\n656\n00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.720\nit's a little too obvious, right?\n\n657\n00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.220\nSo if you put them in the middle,\npencil 77 moniker, right?\n\n658\n00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.720\nTwo unrelated things, you can use two\nwords that are related that you might\n\n659\n00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.180\nremember, that no one else will know.\n\n660\n00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:56.090\nYour dog's name and\nyour aunt birthday is the number and,\n\n661\n00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.810\nyou know,\nyour favorite TV show from the 80s, boom.\n\n662\n00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:07.500\nYou've got, you know skippy1962 and\nknightrider, boom.\n\n663\n00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.447\nThere you go, right great password,\nsufficiently long and\n\n664\n00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:13.524\nit has you know add an uppercase there,\nand you're good to go.\n\n665\n00:34:13.524 --> 00:34:15.830\nOne uppercase letter,\nthat's it and we're here.\n\n666\n00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.340\nNo one's gonna crack that password.\n\n667\n00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.090\nThat's what makes a strong password.\n\n668\n00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.590\nNow you know how to set those things\ninside of your common-password file, or\n\n669\n00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.050\nyour system-off,\nwhatever flavor you may be running.\n\n670\n00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.040\nAnd like I said,\nI know I've run completely out of time,\n\n671\n00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.920\nWes is just like please man.\n\n672\n00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.250\nShut up already [LAUGH].\n\n673\n00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.010\nSo I will, but we have more to talk\nabout when you giving permission,\n\n674\n00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.970\nso we're gonna need another part on this.\n\n675\n00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.942\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I can't interrupt you when you're\nin the middle of talking about good\n\n676\n00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:44.333\npasswords and giving advice like not using\nthings like forbidden character strings,\n\n677\n00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:45.367\nthose dictionary words.\n\n678\n00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:48.815\nHowever Dan, you have mentioned that\none thing we are out of is time.\n\n679\n00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:51.163\nBut before we depart and\nwe go into a part three,\n\n680\n00:34:51.163 --> 00:34:54.290\ndo you have any additional words\nyou might wanna throw in here?\n\n681\n00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:58.610\nConsiderations about maybe PAM,\nthe pluggable authentication module and\n\n682\n00:34:58.610 --> 00:34:59.860\npasswords in general?\n\n683\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:06.670\n&gt;&gt; How long you allow your users to,\nbefore they have to change their password,\n\n684\n00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.970\nthat's a good thing to\nreally try to figure out,\n\n685\n00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.180\nYou will get some backlash\nfrom users a lot and\n\n686\n00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.960\nthat does goes a long way as far as\nhow you set policy, especially if\n\n687\n00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.490\nsomebody with sufficient clout complains\nto someone with sufficient clout.\n\n688\n00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.121\nSo, you know.\n\n689\n00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:22.600\nThere you go, that does tend to happen.\n\n690\n00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.715\nSo try to be reasonable\nin there with them,\n\n691\n00:35:24.715 --> 00:35:27.250\ncuz users don't understand\neverything we're talking about.\n\n692\n00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.630\nEven though we know what's best for them.\n\n693\n00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.090\nAnd then how many passwords they're\nallowed to remember, right?\n\n694\n00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.680\nBefore you can reuse that\none you've love the best.\n\n695\n00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.892\nI would probably say, make that large.\n\n696\n00:35:40.892 --> 00:35:43.770\nJust, again,\nwe're trying to be as secure as possible.\n\n697\n00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.670\nAnd the larger you make that number,\nthe more secure you're gonna be.\n\n698\n00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.990\n&gt;&gt; Alright Dan, wealth of knowledge.\n\n699\n00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.800\nAppreciate you being\nin the studio with us.\n\n700\n00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.650\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer watching,\n\n701\n00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.900\nkeep in mind we are coming\nback with a part three.\n\n702\n00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.080\nBut until then, signing out for\nITPro.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n703\n00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lawry.\n\n704\n00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.958\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n705\n00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:06.926\n[MUSIC]\n\n706\n00:36:06.926 --> 00:36:10.052\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.345\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:12.300\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n5\n00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390\nback to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.240\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n7\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.330\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our G Set Fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.380\nWe're actually coming back with a part\nthree on Linux configuration and\n\n9\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.900\njoining us in the studios for this very\nendeavor is none other than Mr. Dan Lowry.\n\n10\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.730\nDan how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Man I couldn't be better.\n\n12\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.200\nI'm so glad to be back here in the\nstudios, I enjoy talking about the Linux\n\n13\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.830\nso much that I tend to lose my\nvoice by the end of the show.\n\n14\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.980\nBut we did that in the last show,\nI was starting to get a little raspy,\n\n15\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.450\nand guess what I had more to talk about.\n\n16\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.320\nThat's why we're here with a part three.\n\n17\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.630\nIn the previous episode we looked at\npluggable authentication modules,\n\n18\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.520\nsetting good passwords, and\nhow to force that upon our users.\n\n19\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.440\nThat's right,\nrunning IT with an iron fist.\n\n20\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.120\nLike we love to do.\n\n21\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.180\nThat's right.\n\n22\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.040\nAnd continuing on, making sure that\npeople don't go where they shouldn't go.\n\n23\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.450\nIs permissions,\nthat's where we need to go into today,\n\n24\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.790\nthat's basically file access permissions.\n\n25\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.170\nSo that I can say Wes has access\nto a file but Mike doesn't, or\n\n26\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.130\nmaybe there's a group, and I want anybody\nin that group got access to the file.\n\n27\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.690\nWe're gonna just basically give you\nthe run down on What the permissions look\n\n28\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.920\nlike, how to set some permissions,\nand work with them so\n\n29\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.350\nyou understand what's going on.\n\n30\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd a little bit on how to do it\n\n31\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.360\nwhen it comes to the file permissions\ninside of a Linux system.\n\n32\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.840\nNow the good news is, distro independent,\ndoesn't matter what distro you're on.\n\n33\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.110\nEvery permission you\nset on a Debian system\n\n34\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.360\nwill be the same as if you had\nset it on a Red Hat system.\n\n35\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.880\nThis is where that ubiquity is\nbasically in every way, shape and\n\n36\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.650\nform the same across Arista.\n\n37\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.360\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n38\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.820\nSo it doesn't matter what you are running,\nwhat flavor, these all should work.\n\n39\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.000\nSo, let's see here.\n\n40\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.100\nWhere shall we begin?\n\n41\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.840\nI guess, the files themselves.\n\n42\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.830\nLet's do this.\n\n43\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.470\nImagine if you will a file system,\n\n44\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.430\nwith files inside of it,yYou might\nactually have one sitting in front of you.\n\n45\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.390\nAnd let's create some test files, so\n\n46\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.120\nthat we can play around with\nthe permissions on those files.\n\n47\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.282\nAnd without disturbing\nanything else on our system.\n\n48\n00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.890\nLet's jump into my machine and\ndo that very thing.\n\n49\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.150\nFirst thing I wanna do is create a\ndirectory that we can use for playing and\n\n50\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.710\nmaybe that's what I'll call it.\n\n51\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.150\nI'll say M K D I R for make directory.\n\n52\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.541\nAnd then I'll call it playing.\n\n53\n00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:36.040\n[LAUGH] That way I know this is for\nplaying and\n\n54\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.740\nnow I can cd, change directory\ninto the playing directory.\n\n55\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.470\nBa-da bing,,\nyou'll notice that my prompt has changed.\n\n56\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.411\nAnd if I do pwd, print working directory\n\n57\n00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.189\nthen it shows that I am forward\nslash root forward slash playing.\n\n58\n00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.560\nSo keep that in mind.You can use files you\nalready have laying around if you want.\n\n59\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.500\nBut be warned, if you lock yourself out of\nthem, you're not gonna be able to get back\n\n60\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.680\nin them, even though you should be able to\ndo that, if you have those permissions.\n\n61\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.270\nIf not, be warned.\n\n62\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.870\nAll right.\n\n63\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.550\nAn easy way to create some files is\nuse a command called touch, T-O-U-C-H,\n\n64\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.270\nlike I'm touching the screen.\n\n65\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.010\nRight, and then give a file name,\nseparated by spaces or just one filing.\n\n66\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.020\nSo I can do, touch file,\nfile 1, like that.\n\n67\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.381\nAnd then I can do, touch file2\n\n68\n00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:36.470\nfile3 File4, like that.\n\n69\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.000\nSo a couple ways in which you can do this,\n\n70\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.310\ntouch command is basically to change\nthe timestamp in which it's last modified.\n\n71\n00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.440\nA file is last modified,\nor worked with, I think.\n\n72\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.570\nI think last modified is\nthe technical way they say it, but\n\n73\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.580\nit also creates a file if there's not\none there by that name already, so\n\n74\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.390\nkeep that in mind,\nquick way to create some files.\n\n75\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.910\nIf we want to see the file sin\nthe directory that we just created,\n\n76\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.230\nwe use the L S command for it.\n\n77\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.080\nList.\n\n78\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.170\nI do that, you'll notice I have file one,\ntwo, three, and four.\n\n79\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.700\nVery very simple.\n\n80\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.420\nSo, how do I see\nthe permissions on these files?\n\n81\n00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.250\nVery simple.\nWe're going to add a little to our\n\n82\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.510\nL S command.\n\n83\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.590\nIf we do L S, dash for our arguments,\nand we can string them together.\n\n84\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.430\nThere's a lot that you\ncan play around with.\n\n85\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.700\nDefinitely look at the manual page for LS.\n\n86\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.370\nSee what kind of cool stuff you\ncan get into when it comes to LS.\n\n87\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.600\nBut typically, I like to do an AL,\none is for all files, show me all files,\n\n88\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.680\neven hidden files.\n\n89\n00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680\nThe other is show me in long list format.\n\n90\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.860\nSo A for all files, even hidden,\nand L for log list format.\n\n91\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.830\nThat long list format is\nwhat is important here.\n\n92\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.250\nThat is going to give us the permissions\nfor each one of the files.\n\n93\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.390\nSo we can take a look at that output.\n\n94\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.440\nI hit return.\n\n95\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.500\nYou'll notice that I get these two,\ndot and dot dot files.\n\n96\n00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.790\nBasically, they are the directories.\n\n97\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.690\nThe directory you're in and the directory\nabove you, that's what those dots are.\n\n98\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.280\nVery simple, but we're looking at file\none, file two, file three and file four.\n\n99\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.380\nAnd over here in this section, I guess\nI'll have to highlight all of this,\n\n100\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.130\nbut over here in this right section, right\nthere, those are the file permissions.\n\n101\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.350\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n102\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.110\nYou'll notice the directories also\nhave permissions, right there, right?\n\n103\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.560\nThey also have some.\n\n104\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.190\nAnd what's going on in here\nis pretty straight forward.\n\n105\n00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.660\nIf you're looking at it\nyou've probably already\n\n106\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.160\nkinda figured some of this stuff out.\n\n107\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.260\nTypically there are three types of file\npermissions, read access, write access,\n\n108\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.700\nand if it's an executable file,\nexecute access, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.480\nThe only difference between the file and\n\n110\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.230\nthe directory is you'll see that\nthe permissions are different.\n\n111\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.840\nOne and B, it has this D at the front,\nletting you know it is a directory.\n\n112\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.930\nSo, if you don't have cool\ncolor coding like I do, you're\n\n113\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.800\non some headless system somewhere, it's\njust monochrome, then you can do an is,\n\n114\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.000\nl and say that's a directory,\nnot just a file, that can get confusing.\n\n115\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.930\nSo, I typically make an alias I notice\non your files there you got three\n\n116\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.590\nR's present.\n\n117\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.400\nSo if you have three different types of\npermissions does that mean somebody can\n\n118\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.210\nread three times better since\nwe've got three R's you've got\n\n119\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.550\nthree read permissions.\n\n120\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.780\nCould you tell me a little bit about\nthat Dan what's going on there?\n\n121\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nTotally Wes is absolutely wrong [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.040\nit doesn't give you\nthree read permissions,\n\n123\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.360\nit gives you three different permissions\nfor different types of users should I say.\n\n124\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.620\nNow let's put it this way.\n\n125\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.840\nYou have the owner of file.\n\n126\n00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.020\nRight?\nThe person that could actually\n\n127\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.400\ncreated the thing.\n\n128\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.000\nYou have the group owner of the file.\n\n129\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.930\nSo if there is a group involved\nin the course of user.\n\n130\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.590\nMost users are in a group.\n\n131\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.290\nSo they get that attribute as well.\n\n132\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.910\nWhat group was that,\nthat created this file?\n\n133\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.210\nAnd then you have other any other user\naccount or account on the system.\n\n134\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.790\nWhat permissions do they get?\n\n135\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.090\nSo they get the three permissions.\n\n136\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.660\nYou get read, write, or execute or\nread, write, and execute or read and\n\n137\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.360\nexecute and read and\nwrite or write and execute.\n\n138\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.750\nAny variation thereof could be the system.\n\n139\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.470\nSo that's what we're looking at.\n\n140\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.430\nFor here, our touch,\nthe default permissions were read and\n\n141\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.790\nwrite for the owner,\nthat's this section right here.\n\n142\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.570\nAnd then we got read permissions for\n\n143\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.300\nanybody in that group,\nwhich is right here.\n\n144\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.700\nYou'll see this is the owner of the file,\nand this is the group owner of the file.\n\n145\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.230\nSo there is a owner called root,\n\n146\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.590\nso there's a user named root,\nthere's also a group called root.\n\n147\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.000\nAnybody in that group would have\n\n148\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.150\nthese permissions which\nwould be read on that file.\n\n149\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.890\nSo basically, actually,\nyou know what, I've gone ahead and\n\n150\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.640\nmade it a little simpler for\nus to take a look at.\n\n151\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.730\nAnd see that information with a diagram,\nor a diagram,\n\n152\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.315\nif you put the syllable\nin the right emphasis.\n\n153\n00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:51.509\nSo let's go over here really quickly.\n\n154\n00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:55.771\nAnd if we look at this output right here,\nI've kinda broken it down.\n\n155\n00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:57.315\nWe got read, write and execute.\n\n156\n00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:58.906\nThere's your owner permissions.\n\n157\n00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:02.218\nThis file will be including\nalong with the show notes,\n\n158\n00:08:02.218 --> 00:08:06.836\nso you can take a look at that if you\nhave simple diagrams, very, very cool.\n\n159\n00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:09.504\nRead, write and\nexecute permissions for the group and\n\n160\n00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:13.332\nthere's the other showing how many links\nbasically or how many directories or\n\n161\n00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:16.180\nfiles are inside of that if\nthere are some, this is a file.\n\n162\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.050\nSo, this is just one.\n\n163\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.028\nThe user, the group.\n\n164\n00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:21.289\nHow large the file is?\n\n165\n00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:23.000\nThat's what you're seeing\nhere with this 2048.\n\n166\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.370\nSo, we go over here and we see zero.\n\n167\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.787\nThat's 0 bytes in size.\n\n168\n00:08:26.787 --> 00:08:29.547\nIt's a file with nothing inside of it.\n\n169\n00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:32.498\nThe directory now has a little bit larger.\n\n170\n00:08:32.498 --> 00:08:34.300\nWhen it was last modified?\n\n171\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.417\nSo, you can take a look at that.\n\n172\n00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:36.971\nGood for security.\n\n173\n00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.835\nIf you know that, that file shouldn't have\nbeen touched before X amount of time,\n\n174\n00:08:40.835 --> 00:08:42.515\nyou see that it's later than that,\n\n175\n00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:45.603\nyou know someone's been fooling\naround where they shouldn't.\n\n176\n00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:46.809\nA little bit of that.\n\n177\n00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:48.386\nAnd then of course, what the file or\n\n178\n00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:50.657\ndirectory name is,\nis the last thing you'll see.\n\n179\n00:08:50.657 --> 00:08:53.529\nSo, kind of breaking that down for you.\n\n180\n00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:55.079\nNow let's talk about\nsetting those permissions.\n\n181\n00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:56.029\nHow do I change them?\n\n182\n00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.608\nHow do I set them?\n\n183\n00:08:57.608 --> 00:09:01.044\nWhat is it that I can\ndo to make that happen?\n\n184\n00:09:01.044 --> 00:09:06.820\nWe're gonna use a little cool command\ncalled chmod or chmod, if you like that.\n\n185\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.775\nBut I typically say, chmod.\n\n186\n00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:11.916\nSo we're basically changing\nthe modification or changing the,\n\n187\n00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:13.809\nI forget what MOD stands for actually.\n\n188\n00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:14.520\nLet's look at the man page.\n\n189\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.651\nMaybe it will tell me.\n\n190\n00:09:15.651 --> 00:09:19.026\nI can't remember off the top of my head,\nman chmod.\n\n191\n00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:19.561\nThere we go.\n\n192\n00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.709\nCchange mode bits, file mode bits and\nthose are the bits,\n\n193\n00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:26.640\nthose are the, right there at\nthe beginning, those file permissions.\n\n194\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.060\nThat's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n195\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.185\nThe chmod page is a well,\na veritable cornucopia of information.\n\n196\n00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:34.347\nThat is going to help you.\n\n197\n00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:36.672\nPlease jump in there and check that out.\n\n198\n00:09:36.672 --> 00:09:37.910\nI wanna get outta there.\n\n199\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.939\nTo get out of that,\nyou just press Q for Quit.\n\n200\n00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:44.435\nWe're gonna use chmod to\nmodify those permissions.\n\n201\n00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:47.316\nWe can do this in one of two ways.\n\n202\n00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:52.198\nI will recommend learning both ways and\nusing one.\n\n203\n00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.864\nThat way,\nyou're familiar with it in case you need\n\n204\n00:09:55.864 --> 00:09:59.920\nto be forced into using\none way over the other.\n\n205\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.316\nAnd then of course,\nyou are speedy and fast and\n\n206\n00:10:04.316 --> 00:10:09.850\ngood to go with the one that\nyou practiced on any given day.\n\n207\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.289\nSo, let's go back to\nover here really quickly.\n\n208\n00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:15.071\nI've got another tab for file permissions.\n\n209\n00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:16.729\nSo, there's two types of file permissions.\n\n210\n00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:20.319\nYou have symbolic mode and numeric mode.\n\n211\n00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:24.288\nOne uses symbols,\ncharacters which are r, w and x.\n\n212\n00:10:24.288 --> 00:10:26.934\nWe saw that when we long\nlisted the files out.\n\n213\n00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:30.193\nWe saw rs and ws and\nno xs were there, some dashes.\n\n214\n00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:34.800\nDash means that that permission is not\nset, but then there's this numeric mode.\n\n215\n00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.148\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n216\n00:10:36.148 --> 00:10:37.960\nThis is where most people start going.\n\n217\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.870\nYeah, Linux.\n\n218\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.949\nThat's like Greek, that's being translated\nthrough Aramaic that's being translated.\n\n219\n00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:48.107\nI need a Rosetta Stone to figure\nout what the heck is going on here.\n\n220\n00:10:48.107 --> 00:10:49.259\nAnd yeah, actually you kind of do.\n\n221\n00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:53.164\nYou've kind of got to figure out what\nis happening with these number systems\n\n222\n00:10:53.164 --> 00:10:54.150\nis a little weird.\n\n223\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.908\nAnd you're right, it is a little weird.\n\n224\n00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:59.177\nBut if we drop down right here\nis the bottom of my thing,\n\n225\n00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:03.103\nyou'll notice that you have any\niteration of this numeric line.\n\n226\n00:11:03.103 --> 00:11:06.717\nIf you'll see right here,\n4 equals read permission.\n\n227\n00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:12.020\nSo if I set a 4, that's letting\nthe system know that file on that,\n\n228\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.483\neither the owner, the group or\n\n229\n00:11:14.483 --> 00:11:20.382\nthe other users is going to be read if\nthat's the numeric value that I use.\n\n230\n00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:23.679\nThat's gonna be, if I use a 2, that\nmeans they only have write permissions.\n\n231\n00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:27.460\nIf I use a 1, that means they\nonly have execute permissions.\n\n232\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.832\nBut it's when I start combining them that\nyou have to kinda add them together, so\n\n233\n00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:33.900\nthat you get the correct permission.\n\n234\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.955\nIf I want read and write, I need to\nadd 4 and 2 together which makes 6.\n\n235\n00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:44.972\nSo if we look down here, we see 4 and\n2 equals read and write.\n\n236\n00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.479\nThis is where I made this\nlovely graphic for us, so\n\n237\n00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:51.478\nthat we can make a little more sense of\nthis, cuz it can be a little daunting, but\n\n238\n00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:53.470\nthis is about as simple a it can be made.\n\n239\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.535\nAnd hopefully, I worked really hard and\n\n240\n00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:58.216\nI hope you guys are understanding\nwhat's going on.\n\n241\n00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:01.982\nIf not, just rewatch over and\nover again and we'll continue to explain.\n\n242\n00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:05.519\nSo, let's take a look at the other ways\nin which we can add these together.\n\n243\n00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.679\nSo if I add all three numbers,\nthat gives me all three attributes.\n\n244\n00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:10.237\nRead, write and execute.\n\n245\n00:12:10.237 --> 00:12:16.658\nAnd since 4 plus 2 plus 1 is 7, that would\nbe the numeric value that I would use when\n\n246\n00:12:16.658 --> 00:12:22.548\nI invoke my chmod command and that would\nbe on the 3 different types of users.\n\n247\n00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:29.651\nSo, you always set all three\nwhen you use numeric mode.\n\n248\n00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:33.501\nWhen I'm using the numeric system,\nI always have to set the owner.\n\n249\n00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:35.321\nI always have to set the group and\n\n250\n00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.229\nI always have to set\nthe other user's permission.\n\n251\n00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:41.274\nIf that's zero for them,\nthat means they get no permissions,\n\n252\n00:12:41.274 --> 00:12:42.487\nthen that's what it is.\n\n253\n00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:46.418\nI just have to, I want full permissions\non my owner, so I put seven.\n\n254\n00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:49.309\nMy group gets no permissions,\nthat gets a zero.\n\n255\n00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:52.172\nMy other users get no permissions,\nthat's a zero.\n\n256\n00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.908\nSo, it'd be chmod 700.\n\n257\n00:12:53.908 --> 00:12:58.118\nLet's take a look at what\nthat actually looks like.\n\n258\n00:12:58.118 --> 00:13:01.091\nSo, let's modify file1.\n\n259\n00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:08.607\nI'll do chmood and I will say,\n700 file1, just like that.\n\n260\n00:13:08.607 --> 00:13:13.755\nSo, command the permission is the bit\nwe wanna send using numeric value and\n\n261\n00:13:13.755 --> 00:13:17.116\nthen the name of the file\nthat you want to modify.\n\n262\n00:13:17.116 --> 00:13:19.502\nIt return, no crazy.\n\n263\n00:13:19.502 --> 00:13:21.169\nHey, you did something wrong.\n\n264\n00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:27.998\nJust went fine, so that means if I\ndo the ls-al and I'll just do file1.\n\n265\n00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:32.256\nYou'll notice that I get read,\nwrite and execute for my owner and\n\n266\n00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:37.378\nthis file1 turned green, because that's\nthe color system going into play.\n\n267\n00:13:37.378 --> 00:13:40.180\nExecutable files in my system are green.\n\n268\n00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.664\nSo since I set the executable bit,\nthat changed that color and\n\n269\n00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:47.416\nyou'll notice that I just have dashes\nall the way down the board for\n\n270\n00:13:47.416 --> 00:13:49.837\nthe rest of humanity inside of the system.\n\n271\n00:13:49.837 --> 00:13:52.379\nSo that group, if you're in that group,\nit doesn't mean anything.\n\n272\n00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:56.453\nOnly the root user has access to this\nfile, but he has got full access.\n\n273\n00:13:56.453 --> 00:14:01.026\nHe's the main man and he's the main man\nanyway or the main woman as it might be,\n\n274\n00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:02.838\nbut that's what's going on.\n\n275\n00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.829\nIf I wanted to say, you know what?\n\n276\n00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:10.455\nI wanna give everybody full access to\nthis file regardless of where they're at,\n\n277\n00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:11.706\nI can do that too.\n\n278\n00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:16.350\nAll you got to do is do my chmod 777.\n\n279\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.840\nUser gets seven, the group gets seven and\nall other get seven.\n\n280\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.390\nAnd then file1, file one.\n\n281\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.890\nAnd we do our LS-l file1, file1.\n\n282\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.922\nThank you, Daniel.\n\n283\n00:14:30.922 --> 00:14:34.358\nI apparently just cannot type today,\nRonnie is rubbing off on me.\n\n284\n00:14:34.358 --> 00:14:35.143\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:38.950\nNow you'll notice it changed to rwx,\nrwx, rwx.\n\n286\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.280\nSo now hopefully,\neverything's starting to make sense.\n\n287\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.748\nIt's not too difficult once you decide for\nthe code for the numeric value.\n\n288\n00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:47.577\nBut if you don't know\nwhat those values are,\n\n289\n00:14:47.577 --> 00:14:49.319\nyou're not gonna get anywhere with this.\n\n290\n00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:53.004\nSo it's very important that\nyou understand read is for,\n\n291\n00:14:53.004 --> 00:14:56.710\nright is to execute as one and\nthat you add them together.\n\n292\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:01.024\nSo if I wanted read and execute,\nit'll be 4 plus 1 is 5.\n\n293\n00:15:01.024 --> 00:15:03.900\nFive would give me read and execute.\n\n294\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.952\nThat's how that works.\n\n295\n00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:07.409\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can't watch the episode\nbefore it's complete, but\n\n296\n00:15:07.409 --> 00:15:10.209\nI really could've used this episode\nwhen I was looking at something.\n\n297\n00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:14.184\nAnd somebody said, well, why don't\nyou just give the application a 755?\n\n298\n00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:15.190\nNow, it makes sense.\n\n299\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.640\nGive the owner read, write and execute.\n\n300\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.088\nGive everybody read and execute.\n\n301\n00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:20.057\nIt makes complete sense.\n\n302\n00:15:20.057 --> 00:15:24.166\n&gt;&gt; That's right and that's a typical\nset of permissions that you'll see on\n\n303\n00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:28.671\nexecutable files, because I don't want\npeople modifying it, but I do want them\n\n304\n00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:32.868\nrunning it and you need read permission\nto execute it if I'm not mistaken.\n\n305\n00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:37.550\nSo I have to set read and execute, so that\nsomeone can execute the stinkin thing.\n\n306\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.502\nNow I guess I don't necessarily,\nI work in so\n\n307\n00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:44.323\nmany different areas thatI\nthink I'm getting confused.\n\n308\n00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:46.653\nAnd with Linux,\nI can just set the execute bit,\n\n309\n00:15:46.653 --> 00:15:48.525\nI can just run it not be able to read it.\n\n310\n00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:49.663\nYou know what?\n\n311\n00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:51.939\nLet's try that or we can.\n\n312\n00:15:51.939 --> 00:15:53.675\nThat's too much.\n\n313\n00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:55.596\nBasics is where we're at here.\n\n314\n00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:56.630\nI don't want to get too far.\n\n315\n00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.620\nIt's easy to run down the rabbit\nholes when it comes to Linux.\n\n316\n00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.700\nSo, I'm gonna step back.\n\n317\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.700\nI don't want you guys\ndrinking from a fire hose.\n\n318\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.910\nThat's a little difficult.\n\n319\n00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.938\nGive you what you can digest and go and\ntake that and then mess with that.\n\n320\n00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:09.166\nThat is how you set that.\n\n321\n00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:15.380\n755, very typical very numeric value\nthat is set using the numeric system.\n\n322\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.610\nSo, the other system is a symbolic system.\n\n323\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.750\nWhole lot easier cuz it kind of makes\na little more sense to us in our brains.\n\n324\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:26.300\nBecause we're using values that make sense\nlike r and w and x, for read, write, and\n\n325\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.180\nexecute.\n\n326\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.130\nAnd then we have user,\ngroup, and other right.\n\n327\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.140\nSo u g and o.\n\n328\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.030\nAnd then all we have to do is say\nwe want to add it or subtract it.\n\n329\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.850\nWe can also do I want it to equal this.\n\n330\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.980\nAlright, so\nit's a very important distinction and\n\n331\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.520\nwe wanna make sure that\nyou understand that.\n\n332\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.870\nLet me clear my screen really quickly,\n\n333\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.270\njust get some of\nthe clutter out of the way.\n\n334\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.190\nLet's change first, let's go to file two.\n\n335\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.393\nLet's change permissions using\nsymbolic mode and see how it's done.\n\n336\n00:16:56.393 --> 00:16:57.408\nchmod.\n\n337\n00:16:57.408 --> 00:17:00.740\nIf I say, u+, well, first,\n\n338\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:06.950\nlet's look at the files,\nls-l file2, all right.\n\n339\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.050\nSo we've got read, write, read and read.\n\n340\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:16.148\nSo owner gets a read, write, group gets\nread and other people get read as well.\n\n341\n00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:20.474\nLet's say I wanted to add executable\npermission to this file for\n\n342\n00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:24.719\nthe other, for everyone else this\nis a script I've written and\n\n343\n00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:27.142\nI want everyone to be able to run it.\n\n344\n00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:31.730\nI would do chmod,\nthen I would say O plus X and\n\n345\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.290\nthen I will save the file name, file2.\n\n346\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:42.420\nJust like there, get the ls- l,\nI just so to doing l on file2.\n\n347\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.300\nAnd now you'll notice that everyone\n\n348\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.220\nhere has now got the executable\npermission as been set.\n\n349\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.720\nVery simple, very straightforward.\n\n350\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.120\nThis is not too difficult.\n\n351\n00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.979\nThis is why I like the symbolic method,\nI think most people do like like\n\n352\n00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:57.210\nthe symbolic method because\nit's very easy to do.\n\n353\n00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.560\nIf I were to take this away,\njust as easy I will say chmod o-x for\n\n354\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.448\nfile2, and now ls-al file2,\n\n355\n00:18:07.448 --> 00:18:11.750\nyou'll notice that x\n\n356\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.710\nis now gone in our permissions area,\nit has changed back to just read.\n\n357\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.900\nNow, we need to look at equals, all right?\n\n358\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.550\nSo, equals means regardless\nof what is already set,\n\n359\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.480\nI want the permissions to be this.\n\n360\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.600\nI'm not necessarily adding or taking away,\n\n361\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.890\nI'm saying this is what the permissions\nequal to, and that's how I wanna set.\n\n362\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.382\nSo if I do chmod, and\nI do other, and I say =, and\n\n363\n00:18:38.382 --> 00:18:44.360\nI'll just say rwx, like in full\npermission on file2, like that.\n\n364\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.950\nAnd now I do ls- l file2.\n\n365\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.560\nYou'll notice it now has read.\n\n366\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.580\nIf I do the same thing,\nlet's really take a test on this here.\n\n367\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:05.555\nchmod and I say other equals rx file2,\n\n368\n00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:10.155\nand now ls- lfile2.\n\n369\n00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:13.260\nYou'll notice,\nit does whatever I say it equals.\n\n370\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.930\nSo, this can be a little handier,\n\n371\n00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.090\ninstead of just trying to figure out do\nI need to add this or that, I just say,\n\n372\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.600\nhere's what the permissions should be,\nI don't care what's already been said.\n\n373\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.610\nI'm the owner of this file.\n\n374\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.090\nI'm setting the root permissions.\n\n375\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.270\nSo, using the equal sign can be a whole\nlot easier, less time consuming.\n\n376\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.470\nCuz you don't have to figure\nout what's already there.\n\n377\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.630\nYou just say this is how\nI want it to be set.\n\n378\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.086\nMake sure you understand\nthe distinction between just adding,\n\n379\n00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:40.530\nif I use the plus symbol versus\nthe equal symbol, there is a difference.\n\n380\n00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.270\nIf I say plus R, and R is already there,\n\n381\n00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.480\nyou'll see no difference in the file,\nright, because there's nothing to add.\n\n382\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.260\nIt's already been added.\n\n383\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.810\nIt's already there.\n\n384\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:56.800\nIf I say plus W and it doesn't have\nwrite permissions, then it will add.\n\n385\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.270\nYou will continue to have read and\nit will add W.\n\n386\n00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:06.160\nIf I do Equals w it will\nremove the read permission and\n\n387\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.670\nonly set the write permission.\n\n388\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.430\nSo that's the important distinction.\n\n389\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.180\nHopefully that makes\na lot of sense to you.\n\n390\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.850\nit's not very difficult\nto be honest with you.\n\n391\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.700\nIt's just a little bit\nthat you have to know.\n\n392\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.330\nThe chmod command itself, how to\neither work with the numeric system or\n\n393\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.150\nthe symbolic system.\n\n394\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.250\nThe symbolic system being\na little bit easier.\n\n395\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:29.630\nBut, numeric is not beyond the grasp of\nany human with an IQ above your shoe size.\n\n396\n00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.370\nAnd then, of course, the file name\nitself that you're trying to modify.\n\n397\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.980\nSo that is the important stuff when\nit comes to standard permissions.\n\n398\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.860\nMan, the time ticks by so fast.\n\n399\n00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.990\nAll right, we've got to hammer\nthrough some really important\n\n400\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.680\nstuff really quickly.\n\n401\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.939\nStick to the SUID and GUID ,right.\n\n402\n00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:54.100\nThe SGID, the SGID is important stuff.\n\n403\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.105\nWhat they do, how they work,\nand then the sticky bit.\n\n404\n00:20:56.105 --> 00:21:00.730\nSo, let's go with sticky\nbit first cuz it's easiest.\n\n405\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.730\nSo, what the sticky bit does is it\nprotects your files from deletion by\n\n406\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.960\nother users.\n\n407\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.227\nThat's, yeah, anybody in that other group.\n\n408\n00:21:11.227 --> 00:21:13.094\nIt doesn't protect it from yourself,\n\n409\n00:21:13.094 --> 00:21:16.711\nit doesn't protect it from people in\nyour group or the group in the file, but\n\n410\n00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:18.986\nit protects it from other\npeople in the system.\n\n411\n00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:24.329\nSo, that O category in your chmod mindset.\n\n412\n00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:27.090\nSo, if I wanna set this in sticky bit,\nhow do I do that?\n\n413\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.189\nI would just have to add, I think it is T,\n\n414\n00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:33.758\nif I'm not mistaken,\nlet me look at my notes.\n\n415\n00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:40.410\nThere's a file with already the sticky\nbit set, let's go play with that.\n\n416\n00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:45.470\nI'm gonna cd slash, or\nI'll just ls it, ls /tmp,\n\n417\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.650\nI'll do the long list,\ncuz that will help us.\n\n418\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.370\nAnd, it's giving me\neverything inside of it.\n\n419\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:56.400\nLet me back out here, there we go,\nget to the root directory.\n\n420\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.300\nAnd now it's ls -l, at /tmp.\n\n421\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.640\nI don't, I wanna leave the slash off,\nI'm such a fool.\n\n422\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.580\nWell it's given to me anyway.\n\n423\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.410\nWhere is the permissions for\nthat file itself.\n\n424\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.650\nLet's do this, let's just say, here we go.\n\n425\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.870\nLowery gets smart in his old age.\n\n426\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.870\nHere we go, there's the temp file.\n\n427\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.590\nI swear, I can do this ladies and\ngentlemen, I promise.\n\n428\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.520\nThere it is.\n\n429\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.140\nYou'll notice this right here,\nthis t on the end of there,\n\n430\n00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.630\nthat let's you know that the sticky\nbit has been set, all right.\n\n431\n00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.170\nAnd you'll notice where that is set.\n\n432\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.680\nIt's in that others group.\n\n433\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.590\nKeep that in mind.\n\n434\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.970\nWe do that cuz, in the temp directory\nit's meant for everyone to have what?\n\n435\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:43.610\nFull permissions, but\nif I create a file in temp,\n\n436\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.270\nand Wes he goes into temp,\nthis /temp directory.\n\n437\n00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.650\nWhat he's got read write and\nexecute as well.\n\n438\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.410\nWhat's to stop him from deleting\nfiles that I've put in there that I'm\n\n439\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.880\ntemporarily storing in that directory,\nthe sticky bit.\n\n440\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.200\nSo when I create a file it\ngets the sticky bit, and\n\n441\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.940\nif I need to add the sticky bit\nif I need to put it in there,\n\n442\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.890\nI can do again with my chmod and\nsymbolic modes or numeric modes as well.\n\n443\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.990\nAll you have to do is a plus or\nminus T, right,\n\n444\n00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.859\ncuz T is the thing we're looking at here.\n\n445\n00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:20.745\nIf we wanna use the numeric\nsystem instead of,\n\n446\n00:23:20.745 --> 00:23:24.643\nyou know how we did 755 or 777 or 700?\n\n447\n00:23:24.643 --> 00:23:27.477\nInstead of using the three digits,\nwe're gonna use four digits.\n\n448\n00:23:27.477 --> 00:23:32.429\nAnd the very first digit Is going to\nset the sticky bit if we do 1, so\n\n449\n00:23:32.429 --> 00:23:36.771\nif it's 1755,\nthen the sticky bit gets set, right.\n\n450\n00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:38.950\nSo pretty straightforward.\n\n451\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.200\nLet me show you the symbolic mode.\n\n452\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.680\nI'm gonna change to my home directory.\n\n453\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.600\nAnd then it was, what was it?\n\n454\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.640\nPlaying, I think we did.\n\n455\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.210\nYeah, there we go.\n\n456\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.249\nLet's set the sticky bit on.\n\n457\n00:23:47.249 --> 00:23:48.257\nGet that out of the way.\n\n458\n00:23:48.257 --> 00:23:50.150\nIt's going a little haywire on me.\n\n459\n00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.542\nHere we go.\n\n460\n00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:54.864\nSet the sticky bit on file3 here.\n\n461\n00:23:54.864 --> 00:24:01.410\nSo chmod and we'll say o+t and\nthen file3 there we go.\n\n462\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.769\nThen we do ls -l file3 and\n\n463\n00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:11.760\nthere's your t even though\nit's a capital T sorry.\n\n464\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.950\nI must've went a little buck wild there,\nshould be a lower case t,\n\n465\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.210\nI don't know why that's doing that.\n\n466\n00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.131\nWell, let's try it the numeric way,\nsee what that does.\n\n467\n00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:24.652\nchmod 1777,\n\n468\n00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:29.050\nlet's just do that.\n\n469\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.411\nAnd then it's file3.\n\n470\n00:24:31.411 --> 00:24:34.480\nThere we go, ls -l file3.\n\n471\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.890\nYeah, there we go.\n\n472\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.360\nSo the numeric gave me\na little bit better.\n\n473\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.670\nI must be using the wrong syntax\nsomewhere or something on my system.\n\n474\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.280\nYou'll notice that this\nworked very well though.\n\n475\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.840\nI wonder if it's a capital\nT that I gotta use.\n\n476\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.130\nThat's weird, anyhoo.\n\n477\n00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.220\nMy system's going berserk.\n\n478\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.900\nI'm not gonna, that is how.\n\n479\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.720\nI've done this in the lab, it works.\n\n480\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800\nI don't know what's happening here.\n\n481\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.390\nThat's how it should go.\n\n482\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.295\nSo if you do O+ or U+ this and\nthis, da da da, there you go.\n\n483\n00:25:01.295 --> 00:25:05.210\nO+T is what you do in symbolic,\n1755 or whatever it is,\n\n484\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.210\nhow you would go the other way.\n\n485\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.400\nI told you I'm losing my voice.\n\n486\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.123\nAll right, let's talk about, so yeah,\nlet's just jump in, let's take a look at\n\n487\n00:25:14.123 --> 00:25:18.650\nhow we can set the SUID in the GUID,\nthat\"s what we're trying to do here.\n\n488\n00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.160\nSo very simple,\nwe're going to my terminal here,\n\n489\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.610\nwe're gonna use our chmod command,\nyet again.\n\n490\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:31.710\nchmod and I guess it would help\nif I told you what the SUID and\n\n491\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.230\nthe GUID actually do, so Sticky Bit\nkeeps people from deleting your files.\n\n492\n00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:42.380\nThe SUID allows you to run executable\nfiles as another user, right?\n\n493\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.960\nSo if I created an executable file and\nyou need my permissions to do something\n\n494\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.440\nwith that file or run that file,\nthen how is Wes supposed to run, right?\n\n495\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.870\nHe's not me.\n\n496\n00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.580\nI would either have to give\nhim permissions to do it, or\n\n497\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.940\nI can say when you run this file,\nrun it as me.\n\n498\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:05.980\nA good example of this is the password\nutility we use to change passwords.\n\n499\n00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.300\nRight because if you're a standard user\nyou can't change your own password.\n\n500\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:14.040\nYou can just type in passwd and it will\nprompt you to change your password and\n\n501\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:21.220\nyou do so, but to do that it has to access\nthe /etsy/shadow file which is root only.\n\n502\n00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.870\nRoot is the only person that has\nthe ability to see that file.\n\n503\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.230\nSo how is it that when I run a program,\nit can modify that file.\n\n504\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.410\nIf root is the only one that has access.\n\n505\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.860\nIn plops in SUID, right?\n\n506\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:40.060\nSo what it does is it allows you when you\nrun that, it actually runs it as root so\n\n507\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.030\nthat when it accesses that file,\nit says you're root imput the password\n\n508\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.350\nvalue to the shadow file, and\nthen exit out, and we're done.\n\n509\n00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.780\nYou might think,\nthat seems a little dangerous, and\n\n510\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.760\nit can be if used incorrectly,\nthis is extremely dangerous to\n\n511\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.070\nset the SUID on things to allow\npeople to run as another user.\n\n512\n00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.860\nSo you have to be very careful with this.\n\n513\n00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.720\nThe good news is the password file\nit does a very good job inside of\n\n514\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.660\nits self as a program to making\nsure that you are the person\n\n515\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.290\nthat has permission to change that file\nbefore it elevates the privileges.\n\n516\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.850\nSo, can't go okay,\nI just want passwords against root,\n\n517\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.170\nchange root password cuz\nit elevated me to root.\n\n518\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.530\nThis gonna go you're\nnot logged in as root,\n\n519\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.950\nbut you're trying to change\nthe root's password.\n\n520\n00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.420\nSo don’t think you're\ngonna get away with that.\n\n521\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.130\nIt seems like you would.\n\n522\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.010\nIt can be done just not using password,\nokay?\n\n523\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:41.170\nSo personal scripts, custom scripts you\ncan definitely mess up big time and\n\n524\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.010\nallow people to gain access\nto things they shouldn't.\n\n525\n00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.230\nSo you should be careful\nwhen setting the SUID.\n\n526\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.280\nVery simple again back to the screen\nhere we go chmod is so I'd say\n\n527\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:59.080\nlike user plus s, little s like that.\n\n528\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.400\nAnd then file4.\n\n529\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:07.700\nJust like that we do ls -al file4 and\n\n530\n00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:13.470\nyou'll see that now there is\nthe bit has been set, okay?\n\n531\n00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.550\nAgain, I'm having a little trouble.\n\n532\n00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.930\nActually, I don't think\nthat's correct here.\n\n533\n00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.150\nLet's go back to the numeric system, seems\nwe're working great on this Collie box,\n\n534\n00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.830\nit doesn't like that symbolic system.\n\n535\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.810\nHow do we do it in the numeric system?\n\n536\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.060\nWe use a 4 as our very first digit,\ninstead of 777.\n\n537\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.198\nSo it's gonna be 4 7777,\nso let's change that.\n\n538\n00:28:31.198 --> 00:28:38.222\nLet's say chmod 4777 on file4, like that.\n\n539\n00:28:38.222 --> 00:28:40.480\nAnd now, there we go, file4.\n\n540\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.670\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.500\nSee, it should be a lower-case so as I\ndon't want my symbolic actions getting\n\n542\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.660\na little hanky over here, but my [COUGH]\nnumeric system is working perfectly.\n\n543\n00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:57.380\nSo file4, we've set the SUID so\nwhatever this\n\n544\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.560\nright here is, that's what that file will\nrun as when Wes runs the files himself.\n\n545\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.580\nHe'll actually elevate his privileges so\nthat he can run whatever access to.\n\n546\n00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.750\nAnd again password's\na great example of this.\n\n547\n00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:17.690\nThen there's GUID which is similar to\nSUID where SUID only works on files.\n\n548\n00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.020\nGUID works on files and directories.\n\n549\n00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.560\nOkay, and why we do that?\n\n550\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.390\nIs because of that whole idea\nwith like that temp directory.\n\n551\n00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.120\nI don't want Wes changing\nfiles that I've done, right?\n\n552\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.190\nThings of that nature.\n\n553\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.750\nOr maybe we're in a group together.\n\n554\n00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.420\nWe're in a development group where\nwe're creating development files and\n\n555\n00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.034\nwe're giving people access\nto run those files and\n\n556\n00:29:42.034 --> 00:29:46.490\nthey need a lot of permissions, but\nthey need to run it as us, right?\n\n557\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.350\nBecause it's doing\nsomething on the back end.\n\n558\n00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.420\nGUID is gonna do that,\nit allows our group members,\n\n559\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.548\nit elevates you to that group membership.\n\n560\n00:29:54.548 --> 00:29:59.470\nSo that way,\nthings stay the way they should.\n\n561\n00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.130\nYou can use groups instead\nof individual users.\n\n562\n00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.120\nAll right, the last thing we,\n\n563\n00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.060\nlet me show you how to do that, that\nprobably would help as well, all right?\n\n564\n00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.650\nAgain chmod,\nI'm gonna go with the numeric systems and\n\n565\n00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.580\nit seems to be working correctly.\n\n566\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.910\nTypically you will do a g+s here,\nall right?\n\n567\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.960\nSo, that group setting that bits,\naccordingly, typically it would\n\n568\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.420\nlook like this, g+s, like that, and\nthen file4 or 5, whatever we have.\n\n569\n00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.720\nDo we have five files in here?\n\n570\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.780\nI don't remember.\n\n571\n00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.041\nNo, we don't.\nLet's touch another file.\n\n572\n00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:33.610\nTouch file5.\n\n573\n00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:41.100\nAnd we'll say chmod and we'll do 2755,\nor whatever we wanna do, 777 and file5.\n\n574\n00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.952\nAnd ls -l let's do this.\n\n575\n00:30:44.952 --> 00:30:47.680\nAnd there you go.\n\n576\n00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.660\nYou'll notice here now you've\ngot the S in the group area for\n\n577\n00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.400\nthe bits,\nletting you know that GUID has been set.\n\n578\n00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.450\nAll right, now can go to the very last\ntopic and I'm going to take a shortest,\n\n579\n00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.200\nshortest amount of time because\nit's super, super easy and\n\n580\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.310\nsimple which is patching your system.\n\n581\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.110\nI don't know, Wes,\ndo you think that's important whatsoever?\n\n582\n00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.980\n&gt;&gt; I would say probably just about\none of the most important things we\n\n583\n00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.300\ndo when we harden any device whether\nit's a network connectivity device, or\n\n584\n00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.390\nin this case a Linux box or\na Linux server.\n\n585\n00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.310\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n586\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.130\nFirst thing you should do out of\nthe gate when you've installed,\n\n587\n00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.000\nit's a new server,\nfirst thing you do, update the thing.\n\n588\n00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.340\nBecause, old versions of things.\n\n589\n00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.340\nVulnerabilities are probably\nbeen discovered.\n\n590\n00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.440\nAnd if you're using an older version,\n\n591\n00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.190\nthen someone's gonna be able\nto exploit that vulnerability.\n\n592\n00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.680\nSo you wanna stay up to date.\n\n593\n00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.250\nCome up with a great patching schedule.\n\n594\n00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.770\nTypically, maybe once a week.\n\n595\n00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.639\nSomething of that nature.\nOnce a month, whatever it is download it,\n\n596\n00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:50.686\ndo it, make sure you stick to it,\nbecause that way is to keep your PCs and\n\n597\n00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:53.789\nyour servers and\nthings of that nature on the latest and\n\n598\n00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:56.564\ngreatest of their latest and\ngreatest, right?\n\n599\n00:31:56.564 --> 00:31:57.505\nThat's what we wanna do.\n\n600\n00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:58.320\nSo how do we do that?\n\n601\n00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.615\nI'm gonna click my screen,\nand inside of the BM systems,\n\n602\n00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:05.270\nyou got the app get system,\nwhich is gonna help us do that.\n\n603\n00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.950\nIf you're running a Red Hat,\nFedora, Ubuntu,\n\n604\n00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.960\nI'm sorry not Ubuntu but CentOS,\nit's gonna be the Yum system, right?\n\n605\n00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.740\nThe Package Management System.\n\n606\n00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.700\nSo I'm gonna do here,\nrun two commands, that's all it takes,\n\n607\n00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.160\nit's very simple,\nespecially when it's out of the gate.\n\n608\n00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.990\nYou do, if you're not running this route,\npseudo don't forget that.\n\n609\n00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.320\nI'm logged in as root.\n\n610\n00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.920\nI'll do apt-get upgrade like that.\n\n611\n00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:36.310\nI'm sorry, update do,\nthis will check apt-get for\n\n612\n00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:40.660\nany updates to the installed\nsoftware on my system.\n\n613\n00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.359\nThen you want to do the apt-get\ndash upgrade like so.\n\n614\n00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:48.980\nYou can run one command, when it's\nfinish you can then run the next.\n\n615\n00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:55.280\nYou also string the two commands together\nby doing this, updates, and saying, &amp;&amp;.\n\n616\n00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.046\nWhere's ampersand?\n\n617\n00:32:56.046 --> 00:32:56.916\nHere you are.\n\n618\n00:32:56.916 --> 00:33:03.090\nAnd then up apt-get upgrade, like that.\n\n619\n00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.630\nSo, it's a one liner that\nwill update your system.\n\n620\n00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.040\nYou can create a script that does this,\nand\n\n621\n00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.980\nthat's all you have to do is run\nthe script and it'll update your system.\n\n622\n00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.090\nVery simple.\n\n623\n00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.250\nYou hit return.\n\n624\n00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:16.990\nYou notice it's starting to download\nthings, looking for updates.\n\n625\n00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.640\nOnce it finds those updates I\nmight get prompted, I might not.\n\n626\n00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.070\nI think typically I do, yeah.\n\n627\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.010\nAnd hit yes, and\nnow it is updating the system.\n\n628\n00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.620\nThis will probably take a while because\nthis is an actual live system that I use.\n\n629\n00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.510\nSo, this is actually updating.\n\n630\n00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.390\nThis is a good thing for this.\n\n631\n00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.620\nSo i'll move over to,\nI do have a CentOS system right here.\n\n632\n00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.845\nLet me log into that.\n\n633\n00:33:38.845 --> 00:33:40.006\nDlowrie.\n\n634\n00:33:44.591 --> 00:33:45.486\nLike so.\n\n635\n00:33:45.486 --> 00:33:46.879\nI think I missed typed my password.\n\n636\n00:33:51.558 --> 00:33:53.800\nSo I messed up my username, there we go.\n\n637\n00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.680\nAnd how the hell, well,\nyou guys can see them.\n\n638\n00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.315\nTell me?\n\n639\n00:33:56.315 --> 00:34:01.623\nI Give you a little extra,\nthat would be better, here we go.\n\n640\n00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:04.572\nAnd we're gonna talk about,\nlet's do this here.\n\n641\n00:34:04.572 --> 00:34:11.387\nSo I would do pseudo,\nyum dash, it's yum check.\n\n642\n00:34:11.387 --> 00:34:14.810\nThat's a check-update, like that.\n\n643\n00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.610\nThat will check for the updates.\n\n644\n00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:22.550\nAnd then, of course,\nI can do the &amp;&amp; yum update.\n\n645\n00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.600\nThat will update the system.\n\n646\n00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.601\nNot gonna do that here because as you can\nsee, it can take awhile depending on how\n\n647\n00:34:27.601 --> 00:34:30.246\nmany updates you have available for\nyour box there.\n\n648\n00:34:30.246 --> 00:34:32.670\nLet me just get that out of the way.\n\n649\n00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.570\nSo that's how you keep\nthe system up to date.\n\n650\n00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.440\nVery simple, very straight forward.\n\n651\n00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.744\nLast thing we wanna talk about is backups.\n\n652\n00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:38.568\nThe importance of backups.\n\n653\n00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:43.040\nIt's not when you fail, but,\nif you fail but when you fail, right?\n\n654\n00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.000\nYou're gonna lose data.\n\n655\n00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.313\nWe don't wanna do that.\n\n656\n00:34:45.313 --> 00:34:48.630\nSo we need to get into\na good backup solution.\n\n657\n00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.470\nThere are great third-party\nbackup solutions,\n\n658\n00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.330\nlike Backula,\nDump &amp; Restore is a decent one, as well.\n\n659\n00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.990\nIt lets you run all the different types\nof backups, full, incremental, daily,\n\n660\n00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.810\nyou name it, it's all in there.\n\n661\n00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.840\nYou just have to find the one you like and\nwork with it.\n\n662\n00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.010\nAn easy way to do backups inside of\nthe Linux system right out of the box\n\n663\n00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.140\nis to be able to use the tar system,\nwhich is tape archiver.\n\n664\n00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.920\nAnd then if you also have it to compress\nthose files, you can use gzip or\n\n665\n00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.430\nanother zipping utility just\nto make the file smaller.\n\n666\n00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.080\nBut let's do that really quickly, show\nyou how to use tar to backup some files,\n\n667\n00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.200\na very simple, straightforward thing.\n\n668\n00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.500\nI'm gonna mkdir, we'll connect to playing.\n\n669\n00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:39.960\nAnd we'll touch some files along file2,\nfile3, like so, we'll do an ls.\n\n670\n00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.320\nActually, I was already, that's weird,\ncd Play, I was doing this earlier.\n\n671\n00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.410\nThere we go, that's what we're\nlooking for, it's clearer.\n\n672\n00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.660\nSo, there we go.\n\n673\n00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.670\nLittle nuts on me here.\n\n674\n00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.660\nTo do this.\n\n675\n00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.630\nSo we do tar, tape archiver,\nis what that's short for,\n\n676\n00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:02.630\ntar, if we say dash C and F, for\n\n677\n00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:10.820\nwe want to create an archive file,\nand what files we want.\n\n678\n00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.880\nWhat file name do we wanna call it,\nI'll call this backup.back or something.\n\n679\n00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.588\nActually, we'll call it tar, backup.tar.\n\n680\n00:36:18.588 --> 00:36:23.950\nBackup.tar, and then what files\nyou want to include in that.\n\n681\n00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:28.114\nSo I have file1, file2, and file3.\n\n682\n00:36:28.114 --> 00:36:29.018\nLike that.\n\n683\n00:36:29.018 --> 00:36:32.420\nSo tar-cf, the name of your tar file.\n\n684\n00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.390\nIt is important to end it with .tar, don't\nlet me mislead you there as I misspoke,\n\n685\n00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:41.583\nand then the names of the files that\nyou want to put inside the archive.\n\n686\n00:36:41.583 --> 00:36:44.490\nAnd here, and of course,\nI'm getting message file directory.\n\n687\n00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.469\nWhat is going on here?\n\n688\n00:36:48.768 --> 00:36:50.430\nEverything was fast here.\n\n689\n00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.970\nOkay, so\nit's thinking there's no files here.\n\n690\n00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.710\nAnd you know what?\nIt's absolutely correct cuz,\n\n691\n00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:59.230\nlike an idiot,\ncreated the files in the other directory.\n\n692\n00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.440\nDon't you love troubleshooting?\n\n693\n00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.016\nIt's so much fun.\n\n694\n00:37:01.016 --> 00:37:02.176\nEspecially on live television.\n\n695\n00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:03.163\nIt's always a good time.\n\n696\n00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:06.050\nLet me remove that backup.\n\n697\n00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.530\nEven though, it did create my backup.\n\n698\n00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.110\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n699\n00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.121\nIt said, I don't care,\n\n700\n00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:13.030\nthere's no files, those don't exist,\nI'm still creating a backup for you.\n\n701\n00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.670\nLet's try that again.\n\n702\n00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:18.031\nTouch file1, file2, file3.\n\n703\n00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:22.927\nNow, tar-cf, backup.tar,\n\n704\n00:37:22.927 --> 00:37:28.558\ntar file1, file2, file3.\n\n705\n00:37:28.558 --> 00:37:32.090\nSo whatever is in those files\nare now gonna be in one backup file\n\n706\n00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.210\nthat I can then shovel\noff to some other media.\n\n707\n00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.620\nMaybe a tape robot system,\n\n708\n00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.570\nor a network share that I have that's\nwhere I save it, and then that gets backed\n\n709\n00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:46.170\nup through some sort of other media\nthat gets removed, there we go.\n\n710\n00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.550\nNo more errors.\n\n711\n00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.365\nThat's what we like to see.\n\n712\n00:37:48.365 --> 00:37:51.610\nAnd then LS, now we have our files.\n\n713\n00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.020\nNotice it doesn't like remove the files.\n\n714\n00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.250\nThey're still there.\n\n715\n00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.330\nThey're just copied and\nput inside of our backup.\n\n716\n00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.800\nIt's a real easy way to do that.\n\n717\n00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:05.416\nThen if we want to extract those files,\nso the worst has happened,\n\n718\n00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:09.273\nI have, like an idiot, removed file*.\n\n719\n00:38:09.273 --> 00:38:12.450\nNo, I do an ls, all my files are gone.\n\n720\n00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.503\nWhat ever will I do?\n\n721\n00:38:13.503 --> 00:38:15.040\nWell, I got my backup still.\n\n722\n00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.554\nSo, I can just say tar dash,\nI think it is c,\n\n723\n00:38:19.554 --> 00:38:23.123\nyeah, -c and then backup.tar.\n\n724\n00:38:23.123 --> 00:38:29.838\nHit return, I must, I think I have to\ndo extract, I don't think it's a z.\n\n725\n00:38:29.838 --> 00:38:36.290\nYeah, -x I believe it is, f.\n\n726\n00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.340\nThere we go.\n\n727\n00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.070\nYeah, that was right.\n-xf, what am I doing?\n\n728\n00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.320\nZ is for compression.\n\n729\n00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.425\nSo if it was a compressed file,\nyou would need z.\n\n730\n00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:44.410\nIf it was like a gzip or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n731\n00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.230\nMy files are back, I have saved myself,\nI'm not losing my job.\n\n732\n00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.650\nBecause even though I\ndeleted the wrong files,\n\n733\n00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.570\nI was able to retrieve them\nquickly using a backup utility.\n\n734\n00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.020\nAnd hence, the reason backups are so\nvery, very important.\n\n735\n00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.000\nWesley.\n\n736\n00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I tell you, I'll definitely\nlet you talk, but I tell you what man,\n\n737\n00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.920\nI can't interrupt all the good work.\n\n738\n00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.365\nIn fact, one of the things I have to\nsay as I kinda venture out of the Linux\n\n739\n00:39:08.365 --> 00:39:09.800\nworld and the comfort zone and\n\n740\n00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.450\nstart to get into Linux zone, I have to,\nhat's off to the Linux the way it updates.\n\n741\n00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.992\nI run one command, I update applications,\n\n742\n00:39:16.992 --> 00:39:19.957\nI update drivers,\nI update the operating system.\n\n743\n00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:22.565\nVersus something like in\nthe Windows world where you\n\n744\n00:39:22.565 --> 00:39:25.950\nupdate the application that does\nnothing to the operating system.\n\n745\n00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.779\nYou update the operating system, well, now\nyou gotta go and update something else.\n\n746\n00:39:28.779 --> 00:39:30.713\nSo, many different places to do updates,\n\n747\n00:39:30.713 --> 00:39:34.491\nit's nice just to streamline one place\nfrom one command in everything's update.\n\n748\n00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:39.655\nNow, one of the things that we do have to\ndo is we have to run this one to the end,\n\n749\n00:39:39.655 --> 00:39:41.010\nwe have to sign off.\n\n750\n00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.640\nBut before we do, Dan, thanks for\nall the great information.\n\n751\n00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.670\nYou got any final words you might wanna\nthrow in there when it comes to Linux\n\n752\n00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.170\nconfiguration for GSEC?\n\n753\n00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:52.320\n&gt;&gt; No, again, it is a lot to,\nif you've never, if you're uninitiated,\n\n754\n00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.780\nit's a lot to take in.\n\n755\n00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.420\nJust continuing, I know we had a little\nhiccup a couple times, but all the correct\n\n756\n00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.260\ninformation is there for you to be able\nto do everything that I've shown you, and\n\n757\n00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.240\njust getting an idea of why\nthese things are important.\n\n758\n00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.090\nWhy are backups important?\n\n759\n00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.560\nBecause you will lose files.\n\n760\n00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.466\nIf you get compromised and\nfiles are encrypted by some bad actor,\n\n761\n00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:14.598\nyou can go to your backup and\nthere they are, right?\n\n762\n00:40:14.598 --> 00:40:16.160\nYou're not completely lost.\n\n763\n00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.700\nYou wanna to be able to set permissions.\n\n764\n00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.700\nI don't want Wesley poking his\nnose where it doesn't belong,\n\n765\n00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.390\nso I'm gonna set the right permissions.\n\n766\n00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.870\nNow we know how to do that.\n\n767\n00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:28.199\nI wanna make sure that if people need\nto run something as a higher elevation,\n\n768\n00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:30.093\nI can do things like Sticky bit and\n\n769\n00:40:30.093 --> 00:40:33.290\nSTUID and GUID,\nwhich will allow me to do those things.\n\n770\n00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.740\nAnd keep him from deleting things as well.\n\n771\n00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.419\nWe also like that.\n\n772\n00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:41.189\nSo, take that away from today's episode\nand learn how to do those techniques,\n\n773\n00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:43.122\nyou should be pretty good to go.\n\n774\n00:40:43.122 --> 00:40:45.889\n&gt;&gt; All right, Dan, well thank you for\nsetting those permissions and\n\n775\n00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:47.085\nprotecting me from myself.\n\n776\n00:40:47.085 --> 00:40:47.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n777\n00:40:47.759 --> 00:40:49.910\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n778\n00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.595\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been you're host, Wes Bryan.\n\n779\n00:40:52.595 --> 00:40:53.416\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel

exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.380\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.747\nin today's episode we're back with more\nof our GIAC Security Essentials series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:26.990\nAnd joining us in the studio is\nhis name is Mike, that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.090\nIt is Mike Roderick joining us again.\n\n10\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.260\nMike welcome back how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.527\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Disassociative\npersonally disorder.\n\n13\n00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:35.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah I'll be Mike today,\nthat'll work.\n\n14\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.200\nAll right yeah thanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.610\nWelcome or glad to be here I should say.\n\n16\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.450\nWelcome everybody is\nwhat I was trying to say.\n\n17\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.073\nYeah, in this one we're going\nto talking about virtualization.\n\n18\n00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:47.251\nAnd first thing I wanna talk about,\n\n19\n00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.355\nif you're not familiar with\nvirtualization where have you been?\n\n20\n00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:54.590\n[LAUGH] It's a very,\nvery common thing in our networks today.\n\n21\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.610\nIt really was a big game changer\n\n22\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.940\nwhen virtualization came out\nit changed a lot of things.\n\n23\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.970\nBut let's define what we\nmean by virtualization.\n\n24\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.184\nWe'll talk about why\nwe would wanna use it?\n\n25\n00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:10.280\nAnd we'll take a look at the different\ntypes of hypervisors that we can get.\n\n26\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.840\nWhere they'd be appropriate,\nwhere not appropriate?\n\n27\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.980\nAnd then we'll talk lastly about security\nthat's what we're here for, right.\n\n28\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.780\nSecurity essentials,\nhow do we secure virtual machines?\n\n29\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.090\nAnd how does that differ from securing,\n\n30\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.650\nsay physical machines that maybe\nwe're already used to securing.\n\n31\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.684\nSo let's start, when we're talking\nabout virtualization wIth computers.\n\n32\n00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:35.787\nWe're talking about basically allowing\nme to take a single set of hardware and\n\n33\n00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:37.860\nrun multiple computers.\n\n34\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.780\nI used the quotes,\nthe air quotes there for\n\n35\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.070\nthe virtualization part and\nrun multiple computers on there.\n\n36\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.500\nWhen they're talking about\na virtual server all right,\n\n37\n00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.160\nis simply a file typically\na couple of files.\n\n38\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.260\nYou've got your configuration file\nthat acts almost like your bios would.\n\n39\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.420\nAnd then you've got your hard drive file.\n\n40\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.510\nAnd that depending on the application\nthat you're using could be a VMDK,\n\n41\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.280\ncould be a VHDX different formats for\nthe different vendors.\n\n42\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.490\nAnd we'll talk a little bit\nabout the different vendors.\n\n43\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.490\nBut basically again,\na virtual machine is a set of files\n\n44\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.620\nthat is treated like an actual computer.\n\n45\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.410\nIt boots up.\n\n46\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.250\nIt goes through POST.\n\n47\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.440\nWe provide access to the hardware.\n\n48\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.766\nWe have virtual network adapters.\n\n49\n00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:25.498\nFor example like I said,\n\n50\n00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:30.150\nvirtual hard drives we can now\nvirtualize fiber channels.\n\n51\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.400\nI guess I can't define any more than that,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.760\nSo that's what virtualization is.\n\n53\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.200\nAnd now why we use it?\n\n54\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.180\nThere's many different reasons\nto use virtualization.\n\n55\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.270\nWe can talk about being green, right.\n\n56\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.164\nI remember an organization I worked\nwith when virtualization was coming out\n\n57\n00:02:49.164 --> 00:02:53.930\nat the time I wanna say we had\n16 servers in our sever closet.\n\n58\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.240\nWhen we started to virtualize all of\nour servers, we went down to three.\n\n59\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.130\nSo a lot less energy being used by\nthe physical servers themselves.\n\n60\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.860\nAs well as, say the air conditioning that\nwas used to keep the server closet cool.\n\n61\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.090\nDidn't have to work as hard, right.\n\n62\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.590\nSo you're saving money there.\n\n63\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.940\nSo there's that green aspect and\nmaybe your organization is not.\n\n64\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.026\nI don't want to use those terms\nbecause they can be derogatory but\n\n65\n00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:21.550\nyou know what I, can I say that?\n\n66\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.344\nCan I say tree hugger?\n[CROSSTALK] Is that allowed?\n\n67\n00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:27.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some people embrace that term,\nso it's fine if you're a tree hugger.\n\n68\n00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:28.017\nThat's cool.\n\n69\n00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:29.312\n&gt;&gt; I mean nothing derogatory buy it.\n\n70\n00:03:29.312 --> 00:03:30.527\nI honestly don't.\n\n71\n00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:34.944\nBut if you're organization is the one that\nstrives to be green in virtualization.\n\n72\n00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:36.424\nEven if you're not,\n\n73\n00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:41.947\nyou tell any c level executive that you\ncan save the money off their bottom line.\n\n74\n00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:44.260\nAnd they're probably gonna\nbe good with that solution.\n\n75\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.111\n&gt;&gt; So company that I worked for\n\n76\n00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:50.229\nwe went from 93 servers down\nto right around 30, right.\n\n77\n00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.840\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n78\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.717\n&gt;&gt; So the power consumption for\nour company dramatically reduced.\n\n79\n00:03:53.717 --> 00:03:58.002\nPlus all the hardware and warranties that\nwe had to do on those things themselves,\n\n80\n00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.753\ndramatically reduced, right.\n\n81\n00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:04.093\nSo it really is the best of both worlds,\nright.\n\n82\n00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:07.130\nThe people that all they care about is the\nbottom line, they're getting their wish,\n\n83\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.071\ndream come true, right.\n\n84\n00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.660\nPeople that are environmentally conscious.\n\n85\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.850\nDream come true, less energy, less carbon\nfootprint, all of the great stuff.\n\n86\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.370\nEverybody's getting to walk away from\nthe table with some sort of benefit\n\n87\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.470\nregardless of what you think.\n\n88\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.270\n&gt;&gt; It is a win, win,\nwin type scenario, right.\n\n89\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.098\nAnd you make another good point, as far as\nyour server footprint in general, right.\n\n90\n00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.990\nYou went from 90 something to 30\nsomething that's a few racks less.\n\n91\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.371\n&gt;&gt; That I can remove.\n\n93\n00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.102\n&gt;&gt; At least two.\n\n94\n00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:33.238\nThose two racks gone.\n\n95\n00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:36.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, two whole racks that you're\nable to pull out of that server closet.\n\n96\n00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:40.663\nOr use for other things, right, that's\nwhere my IDS, IPSs can go, or more SANs,\n\n97\n00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:41.646\nor what have you.\n\n98\n00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:44.239\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Make a backup DR site or something.\n\n99\n00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.992\nTake those racks and\npick it up to buy new racks 30 bucks.\n\n100\n00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.371\n&gt;&gt; If you are leasing, you know.\n\n101\n00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.614\nIf you were renting computer space it's\nless space that you have to take up in\n\n102\n00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:54.154\nyour data center, right.\n\n103\n00:04:54.154 --> 00:04:56.430\nSo maybe a less of a fee there.\n\n104\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.300\nLabs, test environments,\nthe big game-changer here.\n\n105\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.920\nI mean we used to have to mimic\nour production environment\n\n106\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.730\nwith physical equipment.\n\n107\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.410\nChallenging, expensive, never quite\nthe same cuz we can't afford it\n\n108\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.290\nkind of thing with virtualization,\nI can virtualize everything just about.\n\n109\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.450\nAnd I can mimic our production\nenvironment, clients, servers, network,\n\n110\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.650\neverything to truly get good\ntests results or try things out.\n\n111\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.370\nWe've talked about\nthe concept of sandboxing.\n\n112\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.960\nThis is virtualization is\nwhat allows me to do that.\n\n113\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.190\nI wanna play with this malware or\nI wanna figure out what this is.\n\n114\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.270\nIs this really malware?\n\n115\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.340\nWell I can't do it in my\nproduction environment but\n\n116\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.920\nI can do it in virtual environment\nthat's segregated out.\n\n117\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.896\nAnd I didn't have to go and\nbuy separate equipment.\n\n118\n00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:45.785\nAnd set up a little separate\nnetwork to test this I can do it\n\n119\n00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:49.400\nright here on my laptop\nright if it's beefy enough.\n\n120\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.086\nFaster server provisioning,\n\n121\n00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:54.334\nthey come to me and\nsay hey look we need two more web servers.\n\n122\n00:05:54.334 --> 00:05:58.470\nWe need to scale up or\nscale out I should say.\n\n123\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.360\nYeah, easy to provision new\none especially with today's\n\n124\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.730\nvirtualization technology\nit could be a few clicks.\n\n125\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.107\nIt could be user driven even,\n\n126\n00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:07.707\nI could say if you need new\nservers here's where you go.\n\n127\n00:06:07.707 --> 00:06:11.090\nYou can click, click, click, and depending\non what we've assigned your department.\n\n128\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.930\nWe've got so many resources you\ncan use you can whip out your own.\n\n129\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.230\nAnd it's a matter of minutes\nwhere I'm pushing a new\n\n130\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.120\nserver rather than ordering\nhardware dumping it into the rack.\n\n131\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.800\nInstalling the software.\n\n132\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.550\nGetting it all set up and\na week later having a new server in there.\n\n133\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.220\nReducing hardware vendor lock, right.\n\n134\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.290\nWhere I get tied into a particular\nvendor hardware that we've been buying.\n\n135\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.000\nWell virtualization really separates\n\n136\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.330\nthe operating system,\nthe applications from the hardware itself.\n\n137\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.045\nIt decouples them if you will, all rightt.\n\n138\n00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:51.278\nBecause I can take my virtual machine and\n\n139\n00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:54.442\nI might have an older Dell\nthat I'm running Hyper-V on.\n\n140\n00:06:54.442 --> 00:06:58.101\nAnd we're upgrading that server\ncompletely new set of hardware,\n\n141\n00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.320\nI can migrate those virtual\nmachines right over.\n\n142\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.659\nNo issues cuz they're not tied to\nthe physical hardware anymore.\n\n143\n00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:11.730\nSo it decouples those, increased up time\nis typically seen with virtualization.\n\n144\n00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.340\nImproved disaster recovery,\nit's a lot easier to do disaster recovery\n\n145\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.648\nwith virtualization than\nit is with physical.\n\n146\n00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:23.080\nI can have a less expensive\n\n147\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.920\ndisaster recovery site\nbecause it's all virtualized.\n\n148\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.040\nMaybe that's not ideal,\nit's not what we have in production.\n\n149\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.620\nSome things are still physical for\nperformance and things like that,\n\n150\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.670\nbut in our disaster recovery site,\nIt could be virtual.\n\n151\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.470\nWe could limp along until we could\nget everything back in line.\n\n152\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.045\nVirtual Machines are a lot\neasier to backup.\n\n153\n00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.144\n&gt;&gt; They're file.\n\n154\n00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:44.322\n&gt;&gt; They're files, right?\n\n155\n00:07:44.322 --> 00:07:46.754\nSo there's many different ways we\ncan make backups of these servers.\n\n156\n00:07:46.754 --> 00:07:50.301\nA lot easier to restore than\nit was in a physical server.\n\n157\n00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:52.561\nSo improve disaster recovery,\n\n158\n00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:57.679\nisolating applications is a kinda\nSandbox environment, legacy apps.\n\n159\n00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:01.107\nNow many of you out there in your\norganization have an application that.\n\n160\n00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:02.997\nWon't run on a latest operating system.\n\n161\n00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:07.168\nYou've gotta maintain a machine with\nan older operating system just to support\n\n162\n00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:10.570\nthis application because there's\nnothing to replace it with.\n\n163\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.940\nThe coders are gone,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n164\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.330\nEasy to do that in a virtual environment,\nright?\n\n165\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.030\nBecause I can provide\nthe environment it needs to run in.\n\n166\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.800\nWhereas trying to find\nphysical hardware for\n\n167\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.460\nthat older operating system to\nrun on might be more difficult.\n\n168\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.440\nLegacy applications, like I was saying,\nmoving to the Cloud.\n\n169\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.370\nThis is something that a lot\nof organizations are doing or\n\n170\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.500\nat least looking at, at this point.\n\n171\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.190\nIf I've already virtualized\nmy stuff in-house on-premise,\n\n172\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.160\nthen it's gonna be a lot easier.\n\n173\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, you've technically\nmade a Cloud at that point.\n\n174\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.990\nIt's what they call\na private on-prem Cloud.\n\n175\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.070\nAnd now you're just taking all that and\n\n176\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.770\ngoing, hey,\nwould you guys mind doing this for me?\n\n177\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.470\nAnd then it goes back to the whole\nsaving money and lower carbon footprint.\n\n178\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.930\nSo again,\nmore best of both worlds kind of idea.\n\n179\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so a lot of good\nthings can come from virtualization.\n\n180\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.980\nNow when it comes to\nimplementing virtualization,\n\n181\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.170\nlet's talk about the types\nof hypervisors that we see.\n\n182\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.270\nAnd a hypervisor is\nthe virtualization software, right?\n\n183\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.430\nThis is what sits down between\nthe hardware and the virtual machines.\n\n184\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.458\nIt's what allows the virtual\nmachines to connect to the hardware,\n\n185\n00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.900\nis the hypervisor.\n\n186\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.236\nNow, where that hypervisor sits in\nrelation to the operating system is what\n\n187\n00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:29.165\nmakes the difference, really,\nbetween a type one hypervisor, and\n\n188\n00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:30.540\na type two hypervisor.\n\n189\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.384\nAnd we're gonna start with\ntype two hypervisors, one,\n\n190\n00:09:33.384 --> 00:09:36.000\nbecause I think the numbering\nsystem is backwards.\n\n191\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.730\nIt just never made sense to me,\nI mean, it does, but\n\n192\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.630\nit's not the way I would have\ndone it had they asked me.\n\n193\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.910\nThey didn't ask me, so\nthis is what we get.\n\n194\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.310\nThe type two hypervisors\nare what we would also call\n\n195\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.170\nhosted hypervisors because these get\ninstalled like any other application,\n\n196\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.210\nlike installing Office or\nan Adobe product.\n\n197\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.150\nA type two hypervisor gets installed on\nan already existing operating system.\n\n198\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:09.090\nAnd then I can create my virtual\nmachines in that type two hypervisor.\n\n199\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.080\nOr again,\nthey're kind of changing the terminology.\n\n200\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.720\nA lot of people now call\nit hosted hypervisors.\n\n201\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.418\nThis is gonna be things like\nif we go back in the past,\n\n202\n00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:21.120\nthis would be virtual PC from Microsoft,\nfor example.\n\n203\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.660\nVM Wear has player, they have several.\n\n204\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.480\nThey have Fusion,\nwhat's another one they've got?\n\n205\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.810\nThere was something, the workstation\nwas another one that they did.\n\n206\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.510\nOracle's virtual box.\n\n207\n00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.090\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n208\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.510\n&gt;&gt; We used to use that, you, and\n\n209\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.050\nRonnie, and I all used that for\na long period of time.\n\n210\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.230\nBecause it was quick and\neasy to install on my operating system.\n\n211\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.780\nI could create my virtual machines.\n\n212\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.240\nGood to go.\n&gt;&gt; There's one on Linux KDE.\n\n213\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.240\nI don't know if that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a type one.\n\n214\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.390\nIt's kind of a blur there with that one.\n\n215\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.943\nCuz they call it a type one, but\nit's based on a Linux kernel.\n\n216\n00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:01.890\nIt's-\n&gt;&gt; It's strange, it's weird.\n\n217\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.980\n&gt;&gt; I threw it in there just so\nwe could call it a type one, but so, yeah.\n\n218\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.300\nSo hosted Highfires, Oracle VBOX.\n\n219\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.225\nParallels on MAC OSX is another one that\nwould be considered a host because you\n\n220\n00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:15.690\nwould install MAC OSX,\n\n221\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.635\nthen you install parallels on top of that\n&gt;&gt; When\n\n222\n00:11:20.635 --> 00:11:24.605\nwe get into type one hypervisors,\nnow we're talking about\n\n223\n00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:28.775\ninstalling the hypervisor\nunderneath the operating system.\n\n224\n00:11:28.775 --> 00:11:33.572\nSo basically, your host machine's\noperating system is nothing more\n\n225\n00:11:33.572 --> 00:11:36.185\nthan a virtual machine at that point.\n\n226\n00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:38.467\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] that is the operating\nsystem that is talking directly to\n\n227\n00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:39.005\nthe hardware?\n\n228\n00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:41.917\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and if were going to\ndraw this out, you might have a,\n\n229\n00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:44.858\nI should have whipped up\na drawing real quick for us.\n\n230\n00:11:44.858 --> 00:11:49.040\nWith your hosted, you got your hardware\nlayer, and then you've got your operating\n\n231\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.440\nsystem, and then you've got your virtual\nmachines sitting on top of that.\n\n232\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.693\nAnd all calls to the hardware have to go\nthrough the operating system layer down\n\n233\n00:11:56.693 --> 00:12:00.186\nto the hardware and then back up\nthrough to the virtual machine.\n\n234\n00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.290\nWhereas with type ones,\n\n235\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.910\nwe're installing the hypervisors right\non top of the bare metal, right?\n\n236\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.370\nSo, it would be a bare metal hypervisor,\nis another term you might hear for\n\n237\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.090\nthis type one.\n\n238\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.470\nAnd then our operating system\nis installed on top of that.\n\n239\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.340\nAnd so you have your hardware layer,\nand then you have your hypervisor, and\n\n240\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.590\nthen you have your operating system\non top of that, and your VMs.\n\n241\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.330\nInstead of the VM sitting on top of the\noperating system, the operating system is\n\n242\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.510\na box right next to the VM sitting\non top of the hypervisor layer.\n\n243\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.930\nSo that'd be a type one or\na bare metal hypervisor.\n\n244\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.660\nNow, why use one or the other?\n\n245\n00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.170\nWhat's the advantage or\ndisadvantages there?\n\n246\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.230\nHosted base or type two is quick,\neasy to install,\n\n247\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.770\ngreat for just typical usage\nof like end users, or let's\n\n248\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.640\nsay I want to run an application that only\nruns on Windows XP, but I got Windows 10.\n\n249\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.820\nI could install one of those\nhosted based hypervisors,\n\n250\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.640\ncreate a little Windows XP box,\ninstall that application in there,\n\n251\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.260\nfire up that VM anytime I\nneeded to get that application.\n\n252\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.834\nThere's actually other techniques we\ncan use for that same solution now, but\n\n253\n00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:06.460\nwe're not going to go there today.\n\n254\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.970\nBut it'd be a great use for that.\n\n255\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.150\nOr test out Linux.\n\n256\n00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nget sort of that whole dual-boot thing or\n\n257\n00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.180\nmulti-boot thing that we used\nto have to do back in the day.\n\n258\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.610\nNot that that's not still around, but\nwhy when you have virtualization.\n\n259\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.170\nIt's a whole lot easier.\n\n260\n00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.725\nGet the same benefits out of it.\n\n261\n00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:23.175\nIt's actually a lot nicer to work with.\n\n262\n00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:24.140\nWe get the interface.\n\n263\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.960\nYou need to add another card or\nsomething like that, whatever.\n\n264\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.106\nIt's just an easier system all\naround to go with that hosted.\n\n265\n00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:33.790\nAnd then you can play with things\nlike Linux and have a good time.\n\n266\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.490\nI like three different\nLinux distributions,\n\n267\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.860\nsee which one I like the best.\n\n268\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.810\nLoad them up side by side,\nrun them, see how you like them.\n\n269\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.640\nBlast the ones you don't,\nand keep the one you do.\n\n270\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nTesting applications, right?\n\n271\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.690\nI can't install some versions of an\napplication side by side with another one.\n\n272\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.460\nI've been tasked with\ntesting this application,\n\n273\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.030\nsee if we wanna upgrade to it,\nI can do that in a VM and isolate that.\n\n274\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.730\nRemember we talked about one of\nthe advantages of virtualization.\n\n275\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.110\nIsolating that application, and when I'm\ndone with it, I can just kill the VM and\n\n276\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.350\nmy machine that I use everyday still has\nthe right version of the application.\n\n277\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.170\nI don't have to uninstall anything,\n\n278\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.920\nworry about DLL's getting goofed up,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n279\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.820\nSo a good benefit of the type two.\n\n280\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.360\nDownside of my type two of these\nhosted is performance, right?\n\n281\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.900\nYou wont see type two's being used\nin production environments for\n\n282\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.520\nhosting your production servers,\nfor example.\n\n283\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.610\nNot gonna run Exchange in\na type two hypervisor.\n\n284\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.780\nNot gonna run SQL in one of those.\n\n285\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.870\nNot gonna run my Apache web servers\nin a host based hypervisor.\n\n286\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.820\nThey're really good for\n\n287\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.280\ntesting things out, temporary things,\nwhen performance is not key.\n\n288\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.330\nWhen I, because all calls that\nthe virtual machine is making\n\n289\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.250\nhave to go through the operating system.\n\n290\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.080\nThere's another layer there\nthat they have to go through,\n\n291\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.520\nand that's just gonna slow things down.\n\n292\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.480\nWhereas with a type one,\nI've got my bare metal,\n\n293\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.090\nI've got my hypervisor, and\nthen my VMs right on top of that.\n\n294\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.110\nSo my VMs go directly into the hypervisor,\ndirectly into the hardware.\n\n295\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.410\nI don't have that extra later\nof obfuscation, if you will,\n\n296\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.060\nbetween the hardware and\nthe virtual machine.\n\n297\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.330\nSo I'm gonna get much better performance.\n\n298\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.040\nPerformance that I can use\nin a production environment.\n\n299\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.580\nI mean, most of our servers nowadays\nin most organizations are virtualized.\n\n300\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.450\nSo we get that performance benefit\n\n301\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.150\nis really that the big\nadvantage of the bare metals.\n\n302\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:29.220\nNow, when we talk about, let's talk\nabout the ones that are available.\n\n303\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.980\nWe talked about the type twos,\nvirtual box, the old virtual PC,\n\n304\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.020\nVM Player, VM Fusion, parallels,\nthese are all gonna be type twos.\n\n305\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.932\nWe were talking about type ones, now,\nwe're talking about Microsoft Hyper-V,\n\n306\n00:15:45.932 --> 00:15:49.911\nor VMWare VSphere, or\nXenserver from Citrix, right?\n\n307\n00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:53.313\nThose are the three big players\nin the virtualization world.\n\n308\n00:15:53.313 --> 00:15:55.168\n&gt;&gt; VMWare is that's typically known,\nright?\n\n309\n00:15:55.168 --> 00:15:56.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:15:56.135 --> 00:16:00.924\n&gt;&gt; V-Sphere's like their Their management\nsoftware that kinda goes to you.\n\n311\n00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:02.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the IESXI, or ESXI.\n\n312\n00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah ESI is free\n&gt;&gt; Is free one.\n\n313\n00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Right and ESX server\n&gt;&gt; Yeah their commercial one.\n\n314\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.700\nAnd most of these platforms\nhave free versions and\n\n315\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.010\ncommercial versions that you can get.\n\n316\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.000\n&gt;&gt; They want us to get hooked on it man.\n\n317\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.320\nThey want you to be like wow,\nthis super easy to play with.\n\n318\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.470\nWorks really great.\n\n319\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.830\nAnd my license,\nmy free license is running out.\n\n320\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.330\nI guess I'll have to go pay for\nthat big one.\n\n321\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nExactly right,\n\n322\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.950\nnow we're dependent on this.\n\n323\n00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.410\nFor those of you big players on\nthe market, and there's others out there,\n\n324\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.460\nlike you and\nI were talking earlier about KVM,\n\n325\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.130\nwhich is not the keyboard, I guess that's\nnot the same, but keyboard, video.\n\n326\n00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.140\n&gt;&gt; And mouse.\n\n327\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.000\n&gt;&gt; And mouse, yeah.\n\n328\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.540\nNot that kind of KVM.\n\n329\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.172\n&gt;&gt; Not [INAUDIBLE].\n\n330\n00:16:38.172 --> 00:16:38.741\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; KVM for\n\n331\n00:16:38.741 --> 00:16:40.530\n&gt;&gt; For a kernel virtual machine,\n\n332\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.840\nis a Linux flavor of a bare\nmetal hypervisor, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.660\nAnyway, where was I going with this?\n\n334\n00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.480\nWe talked about the different\ntypes that you could see.\n\n335\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.040\nI pulled up a couple web pages.\n\n336\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.780\nNot that it's really important for\nthis, but\n\n337\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.050\nI did wanna show you one thing\nthat kind of I found humorous.\n\n338\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.200\nHere is a Zen server by Citrix.\n\n339\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.610\nWhat was it wanted to point out?\n\n340\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.730\nIf you look at this here, see how Citrix\nsensor server beats VMware, V-Sphere.\n\n341\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.390\nHyper-V is a Microsoft Solution.\n\n342\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.140\nCompare Hyper-V to VMware.\n\n343\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.950\nWhat does that tell you about VMware?\n\n344\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.200\n&gt;&gt; VMware is the top dog on the market and\n\n345\n00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.140\neverybody's trying to kick\nthem off the king of the hill.\n\n346\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.190\n&gt;&gt; It kind of does, right?\n\n347\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.660\nWhen you compare yourself to somebody,\n\n348\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.480\nit's usually because\nthey are better to you.\n\n349\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.150\nBut I'm not saying that Microsoft or\nCitrix, this is a vendor neutral exam.\n\n350\n00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.190\nAnd it's not into that, but\n\n351\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.920\nI just thought that was humorous as\nI was going through these pages.\n\n352\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.300\nBut there's Microsoft.\n\n353\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.160\nYou've got Red Hat, Linux virtualization.\n\n354\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.870\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.840\nWhere was I?\n\n356\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.360\nI have their KVM solution over here.\n\n357\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.310\nMicrosoft for example has,\nthey'll say it's free.\n\n358\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.440\nThey'll say this is why\nwe can beat the TCO and\n\n359\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.260\nthe other virtualization\nplatforms because it's free.\n\n360\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.050\nWell, it's part of your server license,\nright?\n\n361\n00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.260\nBut they do have a free version.\n\n362\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.470\nYou can go out and get Microsoft 2012\nHyperVisor where it's just the HyperVisor.\n\n363\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.360\nAnd most of the free ones, like most of\nthese other platforms have a free version.\n\n364\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.472\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [INAUDIBLE] remember?\n\n365\n00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:10.065\n&gt;&gt; That's typically\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Way back in the day, yep.\n\n366\n00:18:10.065 --> 00:18:13.290\nA lot of the freer ones don't have\nthe same management interface.\n\n367\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.290\nOr they limit the number of virtual\nmachines you can run concurrently.\n\n368\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.910\nMaybe there's no GUI front-end for\nmanaging it.\n\n369\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.800\nYou move up into the page,\nyou get the support and things like that.\n\n370\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.900\nBut again, that's really not\nwhat we're here to discuss.\n\n371\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.550\nI just wanted to make sure we understand\nthe difference between the type-1 and\n\n372\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.450\nthe type-2 hypervisors.\n\n373\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.500\nOr the bare metal versus the hosted.\n\n374\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.040\nLet's talk about security.\n\n375\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.030\nWhen we talk about\nsecuring virtual machines,\n\n376\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.470\na lot of it is exactly the same\nas securing a physical machine,\n\n377\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.045\nbecause in the end they behave\njust like a physical machine.\n\n378\n00:18:44.045 --> 00:18:47.525\nThey have processing capabilities,\nthey have RAM, they have hard drive space,\n\n379\n00:18:47.525 --> 00:18:50.785\nthey have page files, they have users,\nthey have SAM account files or\n\n380\n00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:51.795\nsecurity databases.\n\n381\n00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:53.015\nWe can authenticate to them.\n\n382\n00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:55.965\nThey can connect to the network,\nthey can provide services.\n\n383\n00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:58.510\nI mean they are just\nlike my physical machine,\n\n384\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.520\nexcept they're not physical, right?\n\n385\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.370\nSo the same kind of thing has\nto go into protecting them.\n\n386\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.400\nI need to run antivirus software on them.\n\n387\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.140\nI need to run firewalls on them.\n\n388\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.330\nI have to patch them,\njust like any other machine.\n\n389\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.430\nI have to do my updates on those guys.\n\n390\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.450\nI want to harden them like any other\nserver, disable unnecessary services.\n\n391\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.960\nMonitor or resource utilization.\n\n392\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.640\nAll of that is really the same as\nAny other machine on my network.\n\n393\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.040\nBut then there are some things that we\nhave to think of that virtualization\n\n394\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.910\nadds to what we already do in\ntrying to secure our normal hosts.\n\n395\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:37.060\nBecause of the fact that virtual machines\nare running on top of hypervisor and\n\n396\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.820\nthey're sharing resources.\n\n397\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.280\nI've got my bare metal and it's got.\n\n398\n00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.840\n128 GB of RAM.\n\n399\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.960\nIt's got four quad-core processors in\nthere, it's got tons of disk space.\n\n400\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.410\nAnd I start installing virtual machines,\nvirtual servers.\n\n401\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.500\nSay virtual machine,\nvirtual server, same thing.\n\n402\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.650\nAll right, so I start creating my VMs, my\nvirtual machines, and what I have to do is\n\n403\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.350\nnow take the resources of the physical\nmachine has and divide them up.\n\n404\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.430\nRight?\nI can only create so\n\n405\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.060\nmany virtual machines on there because\neach one of those virtual machines is\n\n406\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.290\ngoing to take a slice of\nthat RAM that's available.\n\n407\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.950\nTake a slice of that processing\npower that's available,\n\n408\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.830\ntake a slice of that hard\ndrive that's available.\n\n409\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.080\nThey're gonna consume some of\nthe bandwidth on the network adaptor\n\n410\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.690\nof that physical machine.\n\n411\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.700\nSo as I create more and more,\nwith the resources that I have available\n\n412\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.819\nbecome less and less, and\nif one of those virtual machines,\n\n413\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.080\ngets infected, or has an issue, and starts\nconsuming tons of, say network bandwidth.\n\n414\n00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.240\nThat's going to affect all\nthe other machines as well,\n\n415\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.920\nbecause they're sharing that bandwidth.\n\n416\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.890\nIt might not directly infect them, but\nstill, they're gonna be sluggish or slow,\n\n417\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.920\nif one machine is chewing up all the clock\ncycles of the host machine, so, you know,\n\n418\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.930\nthere are some things that we wanna\nthink about, that virtualization does\n\n419\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.340\nbring into the picture, that we\ndon't see with our physical machine.\n\n420\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:59.840\nSo, let's talk about some of\nthe security aspects of virtualization.\n\n421\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.340\nWe talked about the insecurity.\n\n422\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.980\nYou're got to harden it just\nlike you would with any server.\n\n423\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.330\nSo it means the same thing.\n\n424\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.750\nThe latest patches, staying on top of\nthat, disabling the necessary services,\n\n425\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.840\nscanning and seeing what ports are open,\nall of that.\n\n426\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.670\nUsing a strong authentication.\n\n427\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:21.340\nWhen it comes to network security, now,\nagain, we're talking, depending on how\n\n428\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.260\nit's set up, we're talking that there's\na potential that I could sniff traffic and\n\n429\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.830\nsee stuff that belongs to other VMs that\nmaybe I'm not supposed to have access to,\n\n430\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.480\nif the network segregation\nis not done properly.\n\n431\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.430\nSo, we've gotta worry about that,\n\n432\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:38.320\nbecause we're using a shared\nhardware shared resources.\n\n433\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.240\nWe can start getting into VLANs,\nwe can start looking at virtual networks,\n\n434\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.280\nenforcing traffic flow, making sure\nthat you could have two machines,\n\n435\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.650\nlook at your host cloud service providers.\n\n436\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.350\nWhen they're hosting these VMs for\ndifferent organizations they have to make\n\n437\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.440\nsure that there's no way those two\norganizations machines can see each other.\n\n438\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.300\nYet, it's all on the same\nphysical platform, right.\n\n439\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.220\nSo, this is something that\nthey have to think about.\n\n440\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.610\nThe management,\nthe network access control, typically,\n\n441\n00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:11.600\nwe're managing these servers,\nvirtual machines, remotely.\n\n442\n00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.840\nSo, I have to remote into some\ntype of management interface,\n\n443\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.600\ncontrolling access to that, because if\nthe wrong person gets access to that,\n\n444\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.900\nto my virtual management interface\n&gt;&gt; They could have potential access to all\n\n445\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.900\nof my virtual servers,\nbecause if I'm the management interface,\n\n446\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.510\nthey could simply start shutting\nmachines down, deleting machines.\n\n447\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.980\nThe host itself needs to be secured,\nwe have to take extra steps to secure,\n\n448\n00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.270\nbecause if I can access the host,\n\n449\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.690\nsometimes people forget about the host and\nthey don't secure it, as well.\n\n450\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.940\nThey're thinking about their\nproduction servers and\n\n451\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.880\nnot the host that's hosting\nthose production servers.\n\n452\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.420\nAnd if I can get access to your physical\nhost I can shut your machines down,\n\n453\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.510\nI can delete the hard drives that\nare associated with those machines.\n\n454\n00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:02.370\nI can try to remote, using that physical\nhost try to access the virtual machines\n\n455\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.062\nthat are running on top of that host.\n\n456\n00:23:05.062 --> 00:23:07.790\nSo [INAUDIBLE] user group security.\n\n457\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.940\nYou know, strong authentication,\nstrong passwords.\n\n458\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.380\nI've seen places where they've\ngot virtual machines and\n\n459\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.250\nthey don't think about it the same\nway they would any other machine.\n\n460\n00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.280\nAnd they're like it's just got one account\non it, everybody knows the password to it,\n\n461\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.040\nwe all log into it.\n\n462\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.970\nIt's not the way to go.\n\n463\n00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.550\nIt needs to be treated just\nlike any other machine.\n\n464\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.300\nAuditing, same thing here.\n\n465\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.480\nJust like any of those,\n\n466\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.870\nI know I sound like a broken record,\njust like any other machine.\n\n467\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.080\nI've got to do my logging.\n\n468\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.300\nI've got to be auditing those machines.\n\n469\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.480\nThat means access to it, monitoring\nwhat's going on on that machine, and\n\n470\n00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.990\nagain don't forget the host machine.\n\n471\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.630\nI've got to audit\nthe host machine as well,\n\n472\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.540\ncuz if I see records of somebody\naccessing the host machine, you know,\n\n473\n00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.960\nwhat are they doing once\nthey access that machine?\n\n474\n00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.120\nAre they accessing my virtual machines?\n\n475\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.894\nHost-guest interaction is another one that\nwe have to worry about when we create\n\n476\n00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:00.446\nthese virtual machines.\n\n477\n00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:02.163\nWe virtualized the hardware.\n\n478\n00:24:02.163 --> 00:24:04.028\nSo I can create virtual CD ROMs,\n\n479\n00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:08.140\nvirtual floppy disks cuz everybody\nremembers what those are.\n\n480\n00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.050\nVirtual network adapters.\n\n481\n00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.100\nDo we need it?\n\n482\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.880\nDo I need a virtual floppy disk?\n\n483\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.070\nNo, I probably don't,\ndepending on what I'm doing.\n\n484\n00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.020\nDo I need a virtual CD ROM in there?\n\n485\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.907\nOnce I've installed the operating system,\n\n486\n00:24:19.907 --> 00:24:22.798\nmaybe I don't want that virtual\nmachine to have access to the CD ROM.\n\n487\n00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:25.913\nBecause it's virtualizing the CD ROM and\nthe physical server, so\n\n488\n00:24:25.913 --> 00:24:28.310\nsomebody could get access\nto the physical server.\n\n489\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.490\nThey could pop a CD in there.\n\n490\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.870\nAnd then go back to\nthe virtual machine and\n\n491\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.960\ntry to install software, things like that.\n\n492\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.151\nSo disabling unnecessary devices.\n\n493\n00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:41.471\nPreventing my users of the virtual machine\nfrom modifying the virtual machine.\n\n494\n00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:43.932\nAdding devices,\nadding a second network adapter.\n\n495\n00:24:43.932 --> 00:24:48.205\nAnd bypassing my rules and\nmy proxies, or something like that.\n\n496\n00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:52.106\nClipboard is another big one\nthat people don't think about.\n\n497\n00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:54.532\nAnd a lot of these guest\nintegration services.\n\n498\n00:24:54.532 --> 00:24:57.800\nWhat allows me to work with the VM and\nuse my mouse and\n\n499\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.055\nkeyboard from the physical machine to work\nwith the VM give you clipboard access.\n\n500\n00:25:03.055 --> 00:25:05.604\nSo that means now somebody\ncould potentially,\n\n501\n00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.521\nmaybe that machine is locked down.\n\n502\n00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:11.260\nBut what if they can get to some\nresource from the host, copy it,\n\n503\n00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.100\nand then paste it on the virtual\nmachine's desktop or wherever?\n\n504\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.530\nSo disabling that,\npreventing them from being able to cut and\n\n505\n00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.520\npaste between the host and\nthe virtual machine.\n\n506\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.876\nThe management systems themselves,\nagain, avoid using built in accounts.\n\n507\n00:25:28.876 --> 00:25:32.410\nLike I said earlier,\nwe need accountability.\n\n508\n00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.620\nWe don't want people sharing accounts.\n\n509\n00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.847\nI wanna make sure that\nDaniel has his own account.\n\n510\n00:25:35.847 --> 00:25:37.008\nI have my own account.\n\n511\n00:25:37.008 --> 00:25:40.342\nSo I can tell who was it that\nshut that virtual machine down or\n\n512\n00:25:40.342 --> 00:25:42.885\nadded that extra network\nadapter to that VM.\n\n513\n00:25:42.885 --> 00:25:45.626\nSelf-signed certificates,\nI see this a lot as well.\n\n514\n00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:49.980\nPeople use self-signed certificates\non these virtual machines,\n\n515\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.260\nI don't know what they're thinking.\n\n516\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.270\nI'm not gonna guess.\n\n517\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.500\nBut don't rely on\nself-signed certificates.\n\n518\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.760\nJust like your physical machines,\n\n519\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.180\nyou want trusted certificates\nbeing assigned to those machines.\n\n520\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.491\nThe network access to management consoles.\n\n521\n00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:08.065\nI know a lot of organizations that don't\nallow access to the management console via\n\n522\n00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:09.310\nthe network.\n\n523\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.791\nYou have to physically go to that machine,\npain.\n\n524\n00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:13.486\nI gotta go in the server closet.\n\n525\n00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:15.227\nI gotta pull out the KVM.\n\n526\n00:26:15.227 --> 00:26:18.180\nAnd I gotta access the management\ninterface that way.\n\n527\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.140\nBut this also means that I don't have to\nworry about people trying to go across\n\n528\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.410\nthe network to access that\nmanagement interface.\n\n529\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.550\nSo when it comes to virtualization,\n\n530\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.880\nagain, this is a 20,000 foot overview,\nthat high level overview.\n\n531\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.950\nBut we'd need to understand why we\nwould wanna use virtualization.\n\n532\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.080\nI think we made those reasons clear.\n\n533\n00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.240\nWe need to make sure we understand the\ndifference between the hypervisors that we\n\n534\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.080\nhave to choose from.\n\n535\n00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.053\nThe type one or bare metal,\nthe type two, the hosted.\n\n536\n00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:45.408\nAnd we need to understand security\nwhen it comes to virtual machines.\n\n537\n00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:48.519\nAnd, really,\nit's exactly what we're already doing.\n\n538\n00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:52.131\nAnd then some because of\nthe fact that it's shared.\n\n539\n00:26:52.131 --> 00:26:54.372\nIt's a virtual device.\n\n540\n00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:59.073\nAnd that introduces new risks,\nnew vulnerabilities that we have to\n\n541\n00:26:59.073 --> 00:27:04.060\nthink of above and beyond what we\nalready do for our normal machines.\n\n542\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well,\nit is a virtual world we are living in.\n\n543\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.680\nMike is definitely\na proverbial virtual guru.\n\n544\n00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.061\n[LAUGH] Now he knows about virtualization.\n\n545\n00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:15.025\nHe's worked with it quite a bit.\n\n546\n00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:16.604\nSo we know the importance of it.\n\n547\n00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:20.064\nYou're gonna work with it as an IT worker.\n\n548\n00:27:20.064 --> 00:27:22.979\nSo you've got to be able to secure it\nif you wanna get into the security\n\n549\n00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:23.593\naspect of it.\n\n550\n00:27:23.593 --> 00:27:26.647\nYou gotta know the security\nangles as well.\n\n551\n00:27:26.647 --> 00:27:29.460\nSo Mike, thanks for\nexplaining those things for us.\n\n552\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.530\nThank you, guys, for watching.\n\n553\n00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.070\nBut that looks like concludes\nour topic of virtualization for\n\n554\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.930\nsecurity inside of\nGIAC Security Essentials.\n\n555\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.034\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n556\n00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:42.494\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n557\n00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.411\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n558\n00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:44.514\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n559\n00:27:44.514 --> 00:27:51.794\n[MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:27:51.794 --> 00:27:54.917\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
