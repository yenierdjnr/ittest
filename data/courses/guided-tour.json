          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,437\n[SOUND] In this video, I wanna take\n\n2\n00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:12,586\na look at the ITProTV Q and A section.\n\n3\n00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:16,070\nIn an earlier video while we were\ntalking about the, the live stream,\n\n4\n00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,788\nI showed you guys how there was a chat\nbox you could use to chat with the host,\n\n5\n00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,720\nlive during the show.\n\n6\n00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,300\nBut, what if you have a question about\na show that we recorded previously, or\n\n7\n00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,030\nyou have a question and it's the middle\nof the night and we're not live?\n\n8\n00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,427\nWell, you're not on your own.\n\n9\n00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:33,595\nWe, we don't just abandon you to your own,\nown devices, right?\n\n10\n00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:36,237\nAnd, and that is one of the problems with\na lot of different study materials that\n\n11\n00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:36,758\nare out there.\n\n12\n00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:40,081\nSo for example, if you're a book\nlearner and you just buy a book, and\n\n13\n00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,350\nyou read it and you have a question,\nthere's nobody to ask.\n\n14\n00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,880\nWell at ITProTV,\nthere's always somebody to ask.\n\n15\n00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,370\nAt the top of every one of our pages,\ni, it's throughout our entire site,\n\n16\n00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,180\nthere will always be a link at the top\nof the screen that says Q and A.\n\n17\n00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,800\nAnd if you hit that,\nthat takes you to our question and\n\n18\n00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,450\nanswer area, which is really\nstyled like an Internet forum.\n\n19\n00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,780\nWhen you go to the Q and A,\nyou'll see a, a basically forum layout,\n\n20\n00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,670\nwhere everything's divided up by topic,\nby certification exam, normally.\n\n21\n00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,995\nSo you'll see CCENT, CCNA,\nright, those are the Cisco ones.\n\n22\n00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:16,700\nHere's CompTIA A+, Net+, and so on,\nMicrosoft Windows 8, Server 2012,\n\n23\n00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,500\neach of the certifications that are there.\n\n24\n00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,120\nAnd if you have a question, and\nyou are studying for Network+, right?\n\n25\n00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,030\nYou can jump into Network+, post your\nquestion, and we'll get an answer to you.\n\n26\n00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,590\nNow, if it's in the middle of the night,\nobviously we're not going to see that.\n\n27\n00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,100\nSo, it's usually within the next day that\none of the hosts to log in and respond.\n\n28\n00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,060\nAnd, and you know we all monitor it,\nI do, Ronny, Nate, Mike, all, all the,\n\n29\n00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,700\nall the people that you see up here on\nscreen, we monitor these forums and\n\n30\n00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,360\nrespond, so it's a great way for\nyou guys to interact with us.\n\n31\n00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,040\nNow, you can send us email also, but\n\n32\n00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,300\nwe like this better because it's public,\nright.\n\n33\n00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,540\nIf you have a question, other people\nmight have that same question.\n\n34\n00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,940\nHere's a chance for them to see that,\nto learn, and to interact.\n\n35\n00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,770\nThe other thing is, we get some really\ngood feedback from the viewers.\n\n36\n00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,180\nThere are a lot of creative\npeople subscribed to ITProTV.\n\n37\n00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,940\nSo, I may have one solution,\nand a viewer out there may have\n\n38\n00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,200\nanother solution that's different,\nbut just as effective.\n\n39\n00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,500\nAnd it's really neat to see\nthose different perspectives,\n\n40\n00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,700\ndifferent points of view.\n\n41\n00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,320\nAnd so\nyou'll see that a lot in the forums.\n\n42\n00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,390\nIt's really great,\nit's a neat way to communicate.\n\n43\n00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,530\nWe do have a general forum, that's just\nwide open for any kind of discussion,\n\n44\n00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,750\nquestions or whatever.\n\n45\n00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,020\nBut the majority of them are,\nare tailored to the certifications.\n\n46\n00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,060\nSo when I go here into the Network+ forum,\n\n47\n00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,760\nI'll actually see questions people\nare posting regarding Network+.\n\n48\n00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,170\nYou'll see, like, here's somebody\nasking about IPV4 addressing and\n\n49\n00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,090\nsubnet masks, or physical\nconnections to a hardware firewall\n\n50\n00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,050\nhow many subnets you\ncan get from a network.\n\n51\n00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,458\nSo these are people that had questions\nabout various things, and it did, didn't,\n\n52\n00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,042\nyou know, didn't make sense to them.\n\n53\n00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,639\nOr this one, I, I remember this one I made\na comment about a, a, a network device in\n\n54\n00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,931\nan episode that I had to do something\nspecial to get it to work and\n\n55\n00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:57,850\nthat I,\nI broke some networking rules to do it.\n\n56\n00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,220\nAnd, since it didn't conform to the rules,\nI didn't want to cover it in the show.\n\n57\n00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,070\nIt's not gonna be on the exam, and it'd\nprobably be a wrong answer on the exam.\n\n58\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,980\nBut it was something I'd done in real\nlife, and so a viewer asked, what was it?\n\n59\n00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,050\nWha, what was it that you did?\n\n60\n00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,930\nI know you didn't want to do it\nin the show, but what was it?\n\n61\n00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,322\nAnd so so I responded to that and I\nexplained, you know, what I had to do to,\n\n62\n00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:18,350\nto get that working, and, and you know,\nthe, the little work around that I did.\n\n63\n00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,300\nAnd, you know, if we have to do\nspecial commands or whatever, we'll,\n\n64\n00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,550\nwe'll normally put those in the post, too.\n\n65\n00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,010\nSo, so, I just kind of explained to\nthem what it was and, and how we did it.\n\n66\n00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,960\nThat's what the Q and A is all about.\n\n67\n00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,060\nIf you have questions,\nwe want to answer them for you, right?\n\n68\n00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,460\nThe idea is, by the time you sit down\nin that testing booth to take the exam,\n\n69\n00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,340\nwe want you going in there\nwith answers in your head,\n\n70\n00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,480\nnot going in there with questions,\nso post your questions here.\n\n71\n00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,520\nOne of us will answer.\n\n72\n00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,130\nYou'll get the information that you need,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,160\nThat's what this resource is here.\n\n74\n00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,770\nThis is available, the, the forums are,\nare wide open, so, if you are a free\n\n75\n00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,520\nsubscriber or a paid subscriber,\nyou can read the entire forums, but\n\n76\n00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,880\nto ask a question,\nyou do need to be a paid subscriber.\n\n77\n00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,450\nSo if you're a monthly or\nannual subscriber,\n\n78\n00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,820\nyou'll be able to post your questions\nthere, and we'll answer them.\n\n79\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,460\nIt is a great resource.\n\n80\n00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,420\nIt goes overlooked by some,\nsome customers.\n\n81\n00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,260\nYou know we've got a, a lot of viewers\nthat, that might read the forums,\n\n82\n00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,370\nbut not post.\n\n83\n00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,360\nSo, we encourage you guys,\npost, put questions in there.\n\n84\n00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,590\nThat's how we generate content,\ngenerate topics.\n\n85\n00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,540\nAnd if it's a really good question, we've\nhad this happen a few times, where I said,\n\n86\n00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,960\nboy, I could answer that but\nit would take me forever to type it.\n\n87\n00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,710\nIt would be faster for me to just,\nto just film an episode.\n\n88\n00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,290\nAnd so we filmed an episode\nanswering that question.\n\n89\n00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,880\nI, I love it when that happens.\n\n90\n00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,410\nWe wanna make sure you\nguys get the answers.\n\n91\n00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,360\nAnd if it means we need to record another\nepisode, we have no problem with that.\n\n92\n00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,070\nWe'll do it.\n\n93\n00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,430\nWe'll make sure you get\nthe coverage you need.\n\n94\n00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,060\nSo take advantage of this resource.\n\n95\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,610\nIt's there for you.\n\n96\n00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,540\nI, I know I keep saying that,\nbut it, it's true.\n\n97\n00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,415\nIt's part of your subscription,\nmake use of it.\n\n98\n00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:43,469\nAll right, well we've got a little bit\nmore to get into, but I'll save that for\n\n99\n00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,348\nthe next video, so\nstay tuned and I'll be back.\n\n100\n00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:51,809\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,100\n[SOUND] In each of the videos\nthat you just watched,\n\n2\n00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:14,236\nI highlighted a number of features\nthat are available on ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:18,185\nAnd with some of them, I had to qualify\nwhether you got that as part of a free\n\n4\n00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,225\nsubscription or a monthly or annual or\n\n5\n00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,860\nhow that worked out and\nI know that can get a little confusing.\n\n6\n00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,820\nSo in this last video I just wanna\nhighlight our plans and pricing, and, and\n\n7\n00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,280\nkind of show how that works, and\n\n8\n00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,898\nwhat you get at each level to make sure\nyou've got a clear picture of that.\n\n9\n00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,870\nAt the ITProTV site, you'll see a link\nat the top that says Plans and Pricing.\n\n10\n00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,880\nAnd that's where you can go\nto see information about our,\n\n11\n00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,320\nour pricing structure.\n\n12\n00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,460\nWe try and be very transparent about this.\n\n13\n00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,310\nThere's no hidden charges or\nanything like that, this is it, it's open.\n\n14\n00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,210\nYou know, one of our goals when\nwe first started this company\n\n15\n00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,370\nwas to be a honest company.\n\n16\n00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,760\nNo trickery or\nanything like that involved.\n\n17\n00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,310\nSo our pricing is very plain,\nit's out in the open, and\n\n18\n00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,030\nif you want to cancel,\nyou can cancel at anytime.\n\n19\n00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,290\nThere's no hassle involved.\n\n20\n00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,650\nYou can click automated through\nour system if you wanna cancel, or\n\n21\n00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,930\nyou can send a support ticket, either way.\n\n22\n00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,320\nWe, we don't do any hard sales or anything\nlike that and we wanna be as friendly and\n\n23\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,170\nconvenient to use as possible.\n\n24\n00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,700\nAnd, and, you know,\n\n25\n00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,820\nwe basically wanna treat you, they way\nthat we'd wanna be treated ourselves.\n\n26\n00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,580\nSo so that,\nthat's basically what we try and do.\n\n27\n00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,690\nSo on the plans and\n\n28\n00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,460\npricing page you'll see here basically the\nbreakdown of the three plans that we have.\n\n29\n00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,560\nThere is a Basic,\nfree subscription, that is no cost.\n\n30\n00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,190\nIf you choose that you just put in\na username, email address, password and\n\n31\n00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,080\nthat's it.\n\n32\n00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120\nNo obligation.\n\n33\n00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,510\nNo anything like that.\n\n34\n00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,870\nThat will let you watch our live stream.\n\n35\n00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,910\nYou can watch the live feed,\nyou can see the chat You can see the Q and\n\n36\n00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,070\nA, the question and answers library,\nyou know, or the forms,\n\n37\n00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,280\nyou can go in there and see that.\n\n38\n00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,540\nYou can watch on the Roku channel.\n\n39\n00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,180\nYou can see the live feed\non the Roku channel and\n\n40\n00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,250\nyou get access to selected episodes.\n\n41\n00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,510\nWe have a collection of episodes that are\nattached right here to this guided tour.\n\n42\n00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,510\nthat you can watch through.\n\n43\n00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,920\nIt's usually one or two episodes from,\nfrom each of the certifications.\n\n44\n00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,222\nSo you'll see a collection of,\nof free episodes.\n\n45\n00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,310\nAll right.\n\n46\n00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,920\nBut while you do get access to the live\nfeed, you don't have the ability to chat.\n\n47\n00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,140\nYou can't post a question if you have one.\n\n48\n00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,448\nYou can't post to the Q& A.\n\n49\n00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,030\nAll right?\nSo those are things that are reserved for\n\n50\n00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,470\nthe paid subscribers.\n\n51\n00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,230\nAs well as like V-lab access and things..\n\n52\n00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,430\nWe'll see that here in a moment.\n\n53\n00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,930\nAll right.\n\n54\n00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,950\nBut the free subscription is\nstill very power, powerful.\n\n55\n00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,610\nYou can watch our live feed\nto your heart's content and\n\n56\n00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,460\nyou can read all the various content\nthat we make available on the site.\n\n57\n00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,705\nSo that's there and it's a,\na pretty useful thing to have.\n\n58\n00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:30,680\nAll right.\n\n59\n00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,570\nNow, if you do become a paid\nsubscriber with ITProTV,\n\n60\n00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,000\nthat's when you get the full\nbenefit of our service.\n\n61\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,980\nThat's when you get access to asking\nquestions live during the show, or\n\n62\n00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,740\nasking questions via the Q&A forum.\n\n63\n00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,570\nRight?\nVery powerful to be able to reach out to\n\n64\n00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,975\nthe host and, and ask us.\n\n65\n00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:45,820\nAll right.\n\n66\n00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,720\nYou also get access to\nthe Full Course Library.\n\n67\n00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,690\nSo every episode that's been filmed\nsince the day we opened our doors.\n\n68\n00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,790\nI guess that's not entirely true.\n\n69\n00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,900\nWe had some early episodes that\nwere terrible that we deleted.\n\n70\n00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,839\nSo you don't get those.\n\n71\n00:02:56,839 --> 00:03:00,290\n[LAUGH] But all the episodes that\ndidn't suck, you get access to those.\n\n72\n00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,630\n[LAUGH] And so, so you get access to\nthe full course library via the webpage,\n\n73\n00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,490\nvia the Roku.\n\n74\n00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,940\nYou know,\nyou can access the whole thing there.\n\n75\n00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,890\nYou can watch the episodes,\npost any questions that you have and\n\n76\n00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,130\nget that information.\n\n77\n00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,430\nYou also get access to the, the V-Labs,\nthe Virtual Labs, the Sandboxes, so\n\n78\n00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,470\nyou can practice in those.\n\n79\n00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,260\nAnd you get access to\nthe MeasureUp practice exams.\n\n80\n00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,370\nSo you can request those keys, practice,\nmake sure you're ready to take that exam.\n\n81\n00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,930\nSo very powerful stuff, and\n\n82\n00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,291\nit's all right there with part of\njust a regular monthly subscription.\n\n83\n00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,650\nAll right.\n\n84\n00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,380\nIf you decide to go to an annual\nsubscription, if you pay for\n\n85\n00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,540\na year upfront, we discount it, so you get\n12 months for the price of ten months.\n\n86\n00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,720\nRight?\nSo, there is a discount applied and\n\n87\n00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,500\non top of that, you get the ability to\ndownload episodes for offline viewing.\n\n88\n00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,480\nAnd you know, that was a,\na heavily requested feature.\n\n89\n00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,370\nI know I talk about it in another video.\n\n90\n00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,820\nYou guys have already seen it,\n\n91\n00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,140\nthe guided tour but\nthat is the big differentiator there.\n\n92\n00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,580\nGoing from monthly to annual you\nget a discount on your pricing and\n\n93\n00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,300\nyou get access to download\nthe videos as well as the, you know,\n\n94\n00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000\nthe video and audio streams.\n\n95\n00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600\nI know I didn't talk about those yet.\n\n96\n00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,456\nSo, so those are what's\navailable by going annual.\n\n97\n00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:10,620\nYou know, it is a, a great value.\n\n98\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,810\nIt's definitely the one that's\ngonna save you the most money.\n\n99\n00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,080\nBut we know that no everybody is ready\nto make a one year commitment and\n\n100\n00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,050\nthat's why we have our monthly plans.\n\n101\n00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,940\nThe monthly plan you can\ncancel whenever you want.\n\n102\n00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,000\nSo if you're just focused\non one certification and\n\n103\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,510\nyou don't need the whole library,\nthen you just subscribe for a month.\n\n104\n00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,810\nYou know, watch all, all the shows that\nyou need, get the content, pass the exam,\n\n105\n00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,470\nand then cancel.\n\n106\n00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,760\nYou know, that, that's fine.\n\n107\n00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,770\nWe understand that and\nwe want to be flexible.\n\n108\n00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,152\nAnd we want to cater to your needs,\n\n109\n00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,270\nwe will match what's gonna be best for\nyou guys.\n\n110\n00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,970\nAll right.\n\n111\n00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,920\nAnd that's really one of the themes that\nI want to carry through this whole thing.\n\n112\n00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,860\nWe are always trying to\ntake care of the customer.\n\n113\n00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,390\nSo if there's something that we don't\nhave, you look at these options and\n\n114\n00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,480\nyou're like, well that's great, Don.\n\n115\n00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,320\nBut boy, I really wish you had this,\nor wish you had that.\n\n116\n00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,190\nWell, you know what?\n\n117\n00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,470\nWe want to hear from you.\n\n118\n00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,050\nAt the very top of the page\nyou'll see Contact Us.\n\n119\n00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,030\nI know it's not on top of every page,\nit's always in the footer too.\n\n120\n00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,510\nSo it's down there, you can find it.\n\n121\n00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,200\nBut the Contact Us link, it's up there,\nyou can click on that and\n\n122\n00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,400\nit'll take you to a forum and you'll\nsee right here where you can punch in\n\n123\n00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,680\nyour name,

is available.\n\n126\n00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,390\nAnd you, you're welcome to\nemail me directly if you want.\n\n127\n00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:22,410\nI'm don@itpro.tv, we don't, don't hide\nour addresses or anything like that.\n\n128\n00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,360\nSo you can email me directly,\nbut I'll be honest with you,\n\n129\n00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,030\nif you go through the support system\nyou'll get a faster response.\n\n130\n00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,720\nSometimes I get a little overwhelmed.\n\n131\n00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,040\nBut but reach out to us.\n\n132\n00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,800\nLet us know, we love to get feedback.\n\n133\n00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,700\nWe love to hear it.\n\n134\n00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,060\nAnd that's how we find\nout new features to add.\n\n135\n00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,170\nThe, the V-Labs,\nwe didn't originally have those.\n\n136\n00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,960\nThat's a response to things our,\nour viewers were asking for.\n\n137\n00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,260\nThe Measure Up Practice Exams, that was a\nresponse to things the viewers asked for.\n\n138\n00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,800\nSo just, just let us know.\n\n139\n00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,710\nThere are somethings that we can't do,\nyou know.\n\n140\n00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,350\nSomethings that,\nthat just aren't possible for us but\n\n141\n00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,340\nwhenever it is possible,\nwe'll make it happen.\n\n142\n00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,050\nWe'll do whatever it\n\n143\n00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,240\ntakes to make sure that you guys\nget the service that you want.\n\n144\n00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,100\nSo, so just keep that in mind.\n\n145\n00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,820\nWe are very transparent, very

systems\ncome out, we release more material, and,\n\n151\n00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:14,745\nand you stay in contact with us, you\nstay in touch, and you learn as you go.\n\n152\n00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:18,040\nYou learn your way, your style,\nhowever it is, that's what we want.\n\n153\n00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440\nWe wanna create that friendly environment.\n\n154\n00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,950\nSo hopefully that happens and\nwe have a nice, long relationship.\n\n155\n00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,890\nSo keep that in mind again.\n\n156\n00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,990\nReach out to

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,570\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,926\nIn this segment we're going to take\na look at accessing the show notes for\n\n3\n00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:12,230\nan episode.\n\n4\n00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,550\nNow, not all episodes on\nITProTV have show notes.\n\n5\n00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,030\nBut for a lot of them, the host on\nthe show will actually take our, our\n\n6\n00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,560\nvery own notes that we use, and we'll post\nthem to make them available for you guys.\n\n7\n00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,030\nYou can download them,\nand use them for study.\n\n8\n00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,480\nWhen we write the notes, it kind of\ndepends on the age of the episode.\n\n9\n00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,360\nIf it's a newer episode,\n\n10\n00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,220\nthe notes should be embedded right\nin the page beneath the video.\n\n11\n00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,030\nIf it's an older episode\nthough the notes might\n\n12\n00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,760\nactually be embedded in a different way,\nand that's why we wanted to have this,\n\n13\n00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120\nthis video right here to kind of\nshow you where to find those notes.\n\n14\n00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,130\nLet me show you what I'm talking about,\n\n15\n00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,790\nit'll make more sense when\nyou see it on the page.\n\n16\n00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,580\nFirst off, I browsed the ITProTV sight,\nand I jump over to the course library.\n\n17\n00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,640\nOnce I'm in the course library, I find\nthe course that I'm learning about, and so\n\n18\n00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,968\nI'll do A+ today.\n\n19\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,070\nAnd we find the episode whose notes we\nwant to view, so maybe I want to look at\n\n20\n00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,890\nthis storage devices episode,\nI'll jump in here to look at this one.\n\n21\n00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,710\nNow if it's one of our newer episodes,\nfilmed in the last year or so.\n\n22\n00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,240\nThe show notes should be\nembedded right there on the page.\n\n23\n00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,710\nAs I scroll down on the video,\nhere's the notes.\n\n24\n00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,240\nSo when they recorded this episode,\nit looks like we got Wes on this one.\n\n25\n00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,810\nWhen Wes recorded the episode,\nhe wrote down all this information,\n\n26\n00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,950\nall the hard drive data he talked about,\nand so on.\n\n27\n00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,470\nAnd that's really valuable, because this\nis stuff that you've got to memorize,\n\n28\n00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,390\nthat you've gotta know for the exam and\nto have it just written down, and\n\n29\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,650\nalready generated for you is really handy.\n\n30\n00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,790\nSo, the notes are right there on the\nwebpage, but if you wanna download them\n\n31\n00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,840\nto save them, there's actually\na little link right up at the top.\n\n32\n00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,700\nIt's up by the download link for\nthe video, and audio feed.\n\n33\n00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,070\nNow if you're an annual subscriber,\nyou can download the video on audio, but\n\n34\n00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,990\nas an annual, or a monthly subscriber,\n\n35\n00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,330\nyou'll have that notes link right\nthere where you can download them.\n\n36\n00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,510\nAnd, if you click on that,\nit'll take you to a PDF of the notes.\n\n37\n00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,240\nAnd so here's that PDF, and the same notes\nformatted a little bit differently than\n\n38\n00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,730\nwhat you see in the webpage, but this is\nsuitable for saving to your hard drive,\n\n39\n00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,620\nyou can print it out,\nyou know make copies of it, whatever.\n\n40\n00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,132\nAnd now you've got a great\nresource there available to study.\n\n41\n00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:17,160\nAll right, if it's a newer episode,\nyou'll see those embedded right here.\n\n42\n00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,690\nIf it's an older episode,\nthe notes won't be available here\n\n43\n00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,770\ninstead they'll just be available\nunder this link up top.\n\n44\n00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,610\nYou'll always see that link up top\nregardless of whether it's old or new.\n\n45\n00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,860\nIf there's no link whatsoever,\n\n46\n00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,490\nthat means that that particular\nshow didn't have notes.\n\n47\n00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,960\nSome of our episodes are like that.\n\n48\n00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,520\nThere's a few episodes where there just\nweren't any suitable notes to make, and\n\n49\n00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560\nthat might be the case.\n\n50\n00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,150\nBut, you'll find that the majority\nof our shows do have notes,\n\n51\n00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,260\nand they're available right there.\n\n52\n00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,740\nIf you ever have a question, and something\nthat wasn't answered in the show,\n\n53\n00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,770\nyou can always post\nthat in the forums too.\n\n54\n00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,170\nThat's another great place to look for\nnotes.\n\n55\n00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,250\nOur show notes will always be here, but\n\n56\n00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,800\nour user questions that we get from our\nviewers, those end up in the forum, so\n\n57\n00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,130\nmake sure you check out that Q and\nA there, too.\n\n58\n00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,710\nAnother great place to go,\nand find information.\n\n59\n00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,395\nSo, if you're looking for the notes.\n\n60\n00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:06,733\nThe place to look is on the video page,\nbeneath the video, or\n\n61\n00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,084\nright up here in that notes\nlink that's above each episode.\n\n62\n00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:16,319\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
