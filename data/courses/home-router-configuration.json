another great episode of\nITProTV I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.105\nJoining me on the show today is\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:21.790\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n6\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.780\n>> It's going great, man.\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.240\nGreat to be here,\ngreat to be with ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.910\nAnd today, we get to talk a little\nbit about your home router set up.\n\n9\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.430\nAnd I think that's something\nthat everybody at one time, or\n\n10\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.280\nif you're not into computers,\nmight be challenged with.\n\n11\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.151\nSo I really think this is something\nthat's gonna be beneficial to really\n\n12\n00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.655\njust everybody what wants to set up a home\nnetwork, and we'll see if we can demystify\n\n13\n00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.718\na little bit of this and\nbrush off a little bit of the dust.\n\n14\n00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:51.160\nAnd hopefully by the end of the show\nyou'll know exactly how to do this.\n\n15\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.680\nNow one of the things that you are going\nto want to keep in mind that when it comes\n\n16\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.070\nto setting up your home router is locating\nthe documentation to that home router.\n\n17\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.300\nNow if you bought one inside of a store\nyou know it comes in a box a lot of times\n\n18\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.590\nyou are going to have that documentation\nright inside of the box itself.\n\n19\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.210\nHowever, there might be\nsometimes maybe you buy a third,\n\n20\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.920\nyou know like a refurbished, or maybe not\neven refurbished, maybe you buy it off of\n\n21\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.450\nCraigslist something like that,\nsave you a bit of money.\n\n22\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.440\nWell, sometimes the documentation's\nnot going to be included.\n\n23\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.770\nSo one of the things we can do there, is\nwe can always go to the vendor's website.\n\n24\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.330\nWe can use the Internet out there and\nhopefully find that documentation.\n\n25\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.865\n>> So when I buy my router\noff of some dude in a van-\n\n26\n00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:33.631\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.162\n>> And it doesn't have any box, or\n\n28\n00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.023\ndocumentation.\n\n29\n00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.056\nI can still get the documentation.\n\n30\n00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.125\nMost of the vendors if you go to their\nwebsite, they'll have a support area,\n\n31\n00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.250\nor downloads area.\n\n32\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.340\nAnd this is fantastic because\nthat documentation believe it or\n\n33\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.885\nnot it has all the required\ninstructions for\n\n34\n00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:50.735\nyou to get these boxes of\nblinking lights up and running.\n\n35\n00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.615\nSo that you can enjoy Internet\nvia a wireless environment.\n\n36\n00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.645\nIt is very nice.\n\n37\n00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:59.540\nSo don't, I always try to tell people,\ndon't throw away the documentation,\n\n38\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.590\nkeep anything that you have\nelectrical equipment, laptops.\n\n39\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.190\nIt doesn't matter what it is.\n\n40\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.250\nPut all that stuff in\na file folder somewhere.\n\n41\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.180\nYou never know when that\ndocumentation is gonna come in handy.\n\n42\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.530\nBut if you do lose it,\nWes is completely right.\n\n43\n00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.000\nYou can just go to that vendor's website,\nfind that documentation area,\n\n44\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.970\nand download that guide\ndirectly onto your computer.\n\n45\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.450\nSo that is a very helpful tip.\n\n46\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.830\n>> Yeah, so let's go ahead, and let's\nget logged into our home router here.\n\n47\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.636\nNow if, let's say you have\nbought something second hand and\n\n48\n00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:28.881\nyou don't have it from the store,\nkeep in mind that you might have to do\n\n49\n00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.034\na factory reset on it because\nthe documentation might not help you.\n\n50\n00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:34.573\nYou say well I found\nthe vendor's documentation,\n\n51\n00:02:34.573 --> 00:02:37.476\nI tried to log in to the router,\nand it still didn't work.\n\n52\n00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:40.477\nYou might have somebody's\nconfigurations that owned the router\n\n53\n00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:42.285\nbefore you even bought it still there.\n\n54\n00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:44.145\nSo just look on the back of the router and\n\n55\n00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:47.217\na lot of times you'll see just\na little red re-switch button,\n\n56\n00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.300\nprobably have to break out, you know,\na ballpoint pen, and you can\n\n57\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.830\nhold that button in for about 10 seconds\nor so, and it'll typically reset that.\n\n58\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.850\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna log in to our router.\n\n59\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.520\nMost of the routers that you'll log in to,\nthe home systems will\n\n60\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.250\nusually have an IP address of 192.168.1.1.\n\n61\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.343\nOther times you might see 192.168.0.1 so\ndefinitely pay attention to the specifics.\n\n62\n00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:18.454\nNow, one of the first things that we have\nto do if we're going to log in is, well,\n\n63\n00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:22.749\nonce you've got your the IP address to the\nweb configuration page, you're going to\n\n64\n00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.930\nhave to enter a username and password so\nthat's going to be important.\n\n65\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.645\nNow, we also have to take a little bit\nabout how did I make a connection to this\n\n66\n00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:32.319\nweb page?\n\n67\n00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.233\nWell when you first configure the router\none of things that your going to need to\n\n68\n00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:40.148\ndo, typically get you an ethernet cable\nand just plug directly into the router\n\n69\n00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:43.708\nbecause the wireless network a lot of\ntimes isn't set up to where you can\n\n70\n00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:48.292\neven make it in there, into the network\nto make some configurations here.\n\n71\n00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:50.260\nAll right, so,\nwe are going to go ahead, first thing,\n\n72\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.130\nwe are gonna do on this one here is,\nwe are gonna click Setup, and you notice,\n\n73\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.580\nit is gonna challenge me right away.\n\n74\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.162\nIt is gonna say, hey, if you are gonna do\nthis, you need to know the username and\n\n75\n00:03:58.162 --> 00:03:58.922\npassword here.\n\n76\n00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:04.333\nSo I am gonna go ahead and type out\nour super secret user name 'admin' and\n\n77\n00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:07.240\nthen type in our password here.\n\n78\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.910\nAnd notice how the configuration\npage changes a little bit.\n\n79\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.770\nIt's grayed out, and this will be\nspecific to the vendor itself.\n\n80\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.040\nBut notice it's not grayed out anymore,\nit says, hey, let's go ahead,\n\n81\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.270\nwe'll make some configurations and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n82\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.041\n>> Now Wes, where did you find that super\nsecret password, I mean, are you, did you,\n\n83\n00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:25.252\ndoes it ask you to set it up, or\nis there a default, or how's that work?\n\n84\n00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:27.590\n>> Yep!\nThat's exactly, usually there's a default.\n\n85\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.500\nFor instance,\nin this one here the default is admin and\n\n86\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.740\nroot, and I went ahead and just kept it.\n\n87\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.919\nFor the show, I went ahead and\nkept the password here.\n\n88\n00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.032\nOne of the things that you do wanna make\nsure that you do is that you change that\n\n89\n00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:45.144\ndefault user name and password, so\nthat when you go to log into the machine,\n\n90\n00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.869\nyou're logging into\nsomething that's unique.\n\n91\n00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:50.172\nAll right, so\non the basic setup page that we have,\n\n92\n00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:52.593\nthe first thing that you\nhave is your router's name.\n\n93\n00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:56.666\nNow, some of these settings are optional,\nand some of them will tell you right here,\n\n94\n00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.830\nfor instance, this says optional setting.\n\n95\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.865\nSo you might want to change\nthis around a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:06.534\nOne of the first things that we're\ngonna do here is, let's go ahead,\n\n97\n00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:11.800\nI'll tell you what, and figure out\nif we're going to use DHCP or not.\n\n98\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.510\nSo right here you can see\nthat DHCP is enabled.\n\n99\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.500\nAnd this is something that\nwe definitely want to have\n\n100\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.820\nturned on on your own home network.\n\n101\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.720\nWhat it means is that when your mobile\ndevices connect to the network, or\n\n102\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.745\nif you plug into one of the switch\nports on the home router there,\n\n103\n00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:28.865\nit just means it's gonna get\nan IP address all ready.\n\n104\n00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:30.545\nYou're gonna be ready to\ntalk to the network, and\n\n105\n00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:33.565\nyou don't have to do any manual\nconfiguration and that's important.\n\n106\n00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.565\nWe're not gonna really modify\nany of these settings.\n\n107\n00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:39.390\nYou could if you wanted to because they're\nall private internal IP addresses,\n\n108\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.340\nyou typically have the flexibility that\nyou can configure them in any way that\n\n109\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.240\nyou'd like to.\n\n110\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.370\n>> Wes, I will tell the good folks\nout there that sometimes, for\n\n111\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.050\nthe most part, this is fine.\n\n112\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.630\nYou can go with the standards,\nwhatever it gives you by default.\n\n113\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.040\nBut every now and then, you'll have a\ncable modem, a DSL modem or something that\n\n114\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.750\nalso has DHCP and it's got the same IP\nrange and that's gonna cause a conflict.\n\n115\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.741\nSo if you have plugged all the stuff up,\nyou follow all of our instructions and\n\n116\n00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:06.133\nthings still aren't working\nyou can't get to the Internet,\n\n117\n00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.953\nthat might be one of the places where\nyou need to start troubleshooting.\n\n118\n00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:13.543\nAnd an easy thing to do is that if you're\neven scared that that might happen,\n\n119\n00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:17.575\njust go into that DHCP setting right\nthere and change the IP range.\n\n120\n00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.969\nJust change it to something\ndifferent that way it can have its,\n\n121\n00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.770\nit's basically a router right?\n\n122\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.317\nIt's got two separate networks, one for\nthe wireless network, and one that's\n\n123\n00:06:26.317 --> 00:06:30.570\nactually connecting to your cable modem,\nDSL, whatever your Internet connection is.\n\n124\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.378\nSo make sure that you just change\nthat into something different, so\n\n125\n00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:36.386\nthat they're not conflicting,\nhaving the same kind of information and\n\n126\n00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:38.179\nthen that should alleviate that problem.\n\n127\n00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:42.191\n>> That's a great idea, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at our router's interface and\n\n128\n00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.510\nsee if we change our DHCP settings.\n\n129\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.546\nNow in the router here, you're gonna\nnotice that one of the things that\n\n130\n00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:53.066\nwe can't do, notice that we don't have\nthe option to change what the range is.\n\n131\n00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:57.904\nNotice how it says 192.168.1, that\nlooks like it's hard-stamped in there.\n\n132\n00:06:57.904 --> 00:07:01.153\nIt's letting you know there's no\nconfigurations that you can really\n\n133\n00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:02.220\nchange here.\n\n134\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.878\nSo if this is the case where, maybe, the\nmodem and the router are gonna conflict,\n\n135\n00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:10.337\nyou have to figure out which\nside do you want operating DHCP.\n\n136\n00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:14.353\nIn this case,\nif you're modem is in that 192.168 range,\n\n137\n00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:17.370\nyou might wanna disable DHCP on the modem.\n\n138\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.110\nOr I can come right in here, and\nif I really wanted to I could just choose\n\n139\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.340\nDisable here on DHCP and turn this off,\nand then I don't have that conflict.\n\n140\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.710\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna look a little bit at\n\n141\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.110\nthe wireless interface.\n\n142\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.540\nThe wireless interface is,\n\n143\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.050\nwell, one of the reasons we\nbuy one of these home routers.\n\n144\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.050\nThe day and age where we don't need\nwireless communication today has\n\n145\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.030\ndefinitely come and gone, so we'll go\nahead and go to the wireless side.\n\n146\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.450\nNow with the wireless side, one of the\nthings that you'll notice is that if you\n\n147\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.945\nhave a dual band router you might be\nsetting these configurations twice.\n\n148\n00:07:49.945 --> 00:07:53.943\nThat just means that you got some that are\noperating in that 2.4 gigahert range, and\n\n149\n00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:56.817\nother ones are gonna be operating\nin the five gigahert range.\n\n150\n00:07:56.817 --> 00:08:01.670\nAnd with dual band, they're gonna act\nas two totally separate networks.\n\n151\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.619\nSo whatever the configurations\nyou set on the 2.4,\n\n152\n00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:09.500\nyou're going to have to turn around and\ndouble that on the next network as well.\n\n153\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.880\nHere in this one you're going to notice\nthat if I look at the wireless mode,\n\n154\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.560\nit's set for ap, that means It's\ngonna be the managing device, and\n\n155\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.370\nthere's other settings that you can set\nit to if you want it to be a client and\n\n156\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.900\nact like another wireless device.\n\n157\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.000\nThat's typically not why we\nbought our home router here, so\n\n158\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.585\nwe'll leave it as an AP.\n\n159\n00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:33.335\nNow I want you to notice that it talks\nabout the wireless network mode.\n\n160\n00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:37.115\nNow what this means is the 802.11\nstandard that you might be running,\n\n161\n00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:41.545\nif you're running older devices,\nI would run in a mixed mode.\n\n162\n00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:44.705\nBecause that means it's gonna\nsupport newer end devices, but\n\n163\n00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:46.215\nthen it's gonna be backwards compatible.\n\n164\n00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:49.950\nIt's gonna support things as\nfar back as G, or B really.\n\n165\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.040\nIn this case.\n\n166\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.500\nNow notice it says 2.4 gigahertz and\nit doesn't say anything else.\n\n167\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.160\nThat's not a dual band router.\n\n168\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.730\nIt's just got the single band.\n\n169\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.290\nSo we just need to figure out.\n\n170\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.420\nNow if you have relatively new devices,\n\n171\n00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.850\nif you've kept up on your current\ntechnologies, and your like me,\n\n172\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.010\nyou gotta have 15 tablets so you always\ngot the newest, latest and greatest.\n\n173\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.040\nThen you can typically just go ahead and\nsay hey, I'm gonna do n-mode only.\n\n174\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.960\nNow, the benefit to that is that you're\ngonna get 40 megahertz of bandwidth.\n\n175\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.550\nWe could say,\noh actually 20 megahertz of channel width.\n\n176\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.010\nAnd you're not gonna separate these\nchannels to where some of it's\n\n177\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.070\ngonna supply communications to your\nolder devices and your newer devices.\n\n178\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll be in the future here.\n\n179\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.610\nWe'll just go ahead and say N only, and\nwe're going to say full 20 megahertz.\n\n180\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.035\nAnd another thing you also have to figure\nout is what is the SSID going to be?\n\n181\n00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:45.582\nAnd let's call it\na service set identifier,\n\n182\n00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:48.200\nguys just think of it as a network name.\n\n183\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.117\nIf you've ever opened a mobile device and\n\n184\n00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:52.321\nyou've gone to connect\nto a wireless network.\n\n185\n00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:55.602\nYou'll see that it populates a list\nof all the available access points\n\n186\n00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:57.390\nwithin the proximity of that device.\n\n187\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.500\nWell this is the name that that device\nis using, or that that device sees.\n\n188\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.730\nSo pay attention to how you name it.\n\n189\n00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.240\nIt can be customized.\n\n190\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.420\nThis one right here you see it says DDWRT.\n\n191\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.390\nWhat should we call this one, Dan?\n\n192\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.120\n>> We'll call this one,\n>> FBI Van?\n\n193\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.950\n>> Yeah, FBI Van.\n\n194\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.550\n>> FBI Van.\n\n195\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.640\nI can tell you,\n\n196\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.720\nif you call an FBI Van, most people\nare going to stay away from your network.\n\n197\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.660\nSo we'll call this FBI band or\nvan, excuse me.\n\n198\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.270\nThe next one that we got here\nis the wireless SSID broadcast.\n\n199\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.450\nNow this is interesting from\na security standpoint right?\n\n200\n00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.280\nYour SSID or network name.\n\n201\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.200\nIt's being broadcast out and\neverybody can see it.\n\n202\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.160\nEverybody can open up a phone and\nsee the name of your network.\n\n203\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.480\nNow if you disable this broadcast,\nwhat you're doing is you're saying now,\n\n204\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.790\nI don't want it to be\nbroadcast to everybody.\n\n205\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.620\nI don't want everybody seeing it.\n\n206\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.060\nBut a lot of times what this does guys,\nI know that they stress that hey,\n\n207\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.020\nit's a security technique to\ndisable the SSID broadcast.\n\n208\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.730\nBut most people who say that, are coupling\nit with other technologies to help\n\n209\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.390\nsecure the wireless network,\nand not just relying on this.\n\n210\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.270\nCuz if you just rely on not broadcasting\nthe SSID, the only thing you're really\n\n211\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.570\ndoing is keeping the legitimate\npeople out of your network.\n\n212\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.110\nThe people that are supposed\nto be there can't find it,\n\n213\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.940\ncuz it really does nothing\nto stop the hackers.\n\n214\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.100\nYeah, we like to broadcast the SSID.\n\n215\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.340\nIf you're in a home network it's\nkind of the purpose, right?\n\n216\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.820\nI want people who come to my house\nto be able to turn up their laptop,\n\n217\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.540\nto get their mobile device out,\nand say search for networks and\n\n218\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.930\nsay, oh there's Dan's access point.\n\n219\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.550\nThat's exactly what I'm looking for.\n\n220\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.970\nBut connect and\nif I'm not broadcasting, the SSID out,\n\n221\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.720\nthey're not going to be able to find it.\n\n222\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.530\nThey're going need to know that\nit's called Dan's Access Point or\n\n223\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.110\nwhatever I've named it and\nthen be able to connect.\n\n224\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.820\nSo it's not really good,\nespecially in a large\n\n225\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.530\ntransient environment where people\nare moving in and out of your network.\n\n226\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.320\nThat's not going to be very helpful.\n\n227\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.390\nSo for you that's going to cause a lot,\nHelp, I'm going to have to help.\n\n228\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.560\nPeople go how do I get\nconnected to your network?\n\n229\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.560\nDude I don't even see it here.\n\n230\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.800\nAnd you are like okay yes,\nyou have to type in this thing.\n\n231\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.390\nAnd you are like why do you even do that?\n\n232\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.500\nWell because I am being secure and you\nhave secured me right out of this thing.\n\n233\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.460\nThanks a lot.\n\n234\n00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.300\nSo in a I think in small networks,\n\n235\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.250\nhome networks it's easier just to\nleave it open for people to find.\n\n236\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.530\n>> Yeah, yeah that's right cause\nagain you can add other technologies.\n\n237\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.960\nLike the next one here that\nwe have is Mac filtering.\n\n238\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.520\nSo if we I tell you what we'll get to Mac\nfiltering in a second here let's go ahead\n\n239\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.660\nand go to wireless security.\n\n240\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.650\nThe next one we have to figure out\nis do we want a secure network?\n\n241\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.260\nWell that's kind of a funny thing here\nof course we want a secure network.\n\n242\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.180\nSo one of the things you wanna\n\n243\n00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.660\nmake sure is that you're\nsecuring the wireless network.\n\n244\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.290\nSo, to do that,\nyou have to consider which of\n\n245\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.370\nthese security protocols that you're gonna\nuse, and there are a few different ones.\n\n246\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.280\nSo if we turn this to Enable, or\nmaybe not Enable, to a big old list of\n\n247\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.420\nsecurity protocols, we've got a few\ndifferent ones to choose from.\n\n248\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.020\nNotice WEP is at the bottom of the list.\n\n249\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.780\nWEP you should pretty\nmuch just stay away form.\n\n250\n00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.350\nIt's not very secure and there is\na whole bunch of other options here.\n\n251\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.240\nOne of the ones that we really use today\nis the inside of the home environment is\n\n252\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.325\nthe WPA personal mode.\n\n253\n00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.285\nYou have some of these enterprise level\nmodes, and they typically take a lot of\n\n254\n00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:10.605\nextra infrastructure, which is why\nthey call them enterprise modes.\n\n255\n00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:13.060\nIt's something that you're going to\nsee more in a corporate environment,\n\n256\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.965\ncuz they can justify added\nsecurity at the cost.\n\n257\n00:13:15.965 --> 00:13:20.870\nSo we're going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to choose WPA personal mode mixed.\n\n258\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.250\nAnd if we give it second,\n\n259\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.930\nits going to give us the ability to\nchoose some different algorithms.\n\n260\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.170\nNow we're going to go ahead and you have\nto be careful with the security that you\n\n261\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.350\nimplement on your home network\nif you have older devices.\n\n262\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.230\nSOme of these older devices are not going\nto support the higher levels of encryption\n\n263\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.180\nthat some of the more modern encryption\nstandards and protocols give you.\n\n264\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.050\nSo just pay attention to that.\n\n265\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.990\nSo I actually use\na combination of TKIP and AES.\n\n266\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.400\nAnd that just means that some of\nthe older computers or devices,\n\n267\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.910\nif some of those older devices have\na problem connecting to things like AES,\n\n268\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.940\nthey'll still be able to\ncommunicate on your network.\n\n269\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.810\nSo again, we always have to worry\nabout backwards compatibility,\n\n270\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.630\nwhen you are supporting the mobile devices\nand wireless devices within your network.\n\n271\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.320\n>> Now, Wes, that does kind of open us\nup with a huge gaping security hole,\n\n272\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.850\ntrying to be backwards compatible.\n\n273\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:16.820\nBecause those older encryptions, the WEP,\nthe and the WPA, the first version of it,\n\n274\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:22.420\nnot WPA2 Is pretty easily cracked by\nanybody with the wherewithal to do that.\n\n275\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.050\nSo if you need to be backwards compatible,\nyeah you gotta go with what Wes is saying.\n\n276\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.970\nBut it is a good incentive to know that,\n\n277\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:36.390\nto get your network up to snuff\nto have some compatibility with,\n\n278\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.490\nnot some, all compatibility with\nthe latest and greatest WPA2.\n\n279\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.640\nBecause then you don't have to worry\nabout getting your network compromised.\n\n280\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.000\nSo upgrade those devices.\n\n281\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.870\nDon't stay on those older settings.\n\n282\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.950\nTry to get yourself up.\n\n283\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.690\nIf you need to though, it is still there.\n\n284\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.450\nSo it's nice,\nwe'll still have wireless capabilities.\n\n285\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.040\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nAnd you know, if you've got newer devices,\n\n286\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.720\nby all means go with AES, go with the\nstrongest level of encryption you can get,\n\n287\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.340\ncuz you're gonna get just more\nprotection within your networks.\n\n288\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.020\nAnd remember, you're responsible for\nwhat happens on your networks,\n\n289\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.940\neven if it's not you doing\nwhatever it is on that network.\n\n290\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.400\nSo if you set this up for\nrelatively weak encryption, and\n\n291\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.590\nthen you go on a vacation somewhere.\n\n292\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.680\nAnd somebody jumps on that network,\nit's like Dan said.\n\n293\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.590\nI mean, I've seen people crack\na web key in two minutes,\n\n294\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.820\nin the time that it takes to play a video.\n\n295\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.320\nThey're on your network, and\nif you're out there on vacation somewhere.\n\n296\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.400\nSomebody does something on your network,\nwell they're gonna hold you accountable.\n\n297\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.940\nSo make sure that it's secure.\n\n298\n00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.140\nNow the next thing we have to understand\nis that inside of your security settings,\n\n299\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.830\nyou're gonna have what's\nknown as a pre-share key.\n\n300\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.420\nGuys, preshare key is just\ntechnical lingo for a password.\n\n301\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.610\nRight?\nIf you think about it\n\n302\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.860\nIf I'm going to log into a system,\nI have to know the password beforehand.\n\n303\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.230\nAnd the system that I'm logging into also\nhas to know that password beforehand, and\n\n304\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.490\nthat's why they call it a pre-shared key.\n\n305\n00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.930\n>> I was gonna say hence\nthe pre-shared key.\n\n306\n00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.850\n>> That's right.\n\n307\n00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.201\nThat's essentially what it is.\n\n308\n00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:55.923\nIt's a pre-shared key,\n\n309\n00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:59.922\nand this is the same key that's\ngonna be in the dialogue box.\n\n310\n00:15:59.922 --> 00:16:03.593\nWhen you go to join the network,\nthis will be the same exact password or\n\n311\n00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:07.641\nphrase that it's asking you to put in so\nthat your device can associate itself\n\n312\n00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:10.880\nwith the network and\nthen start communicating here.\n\n313\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.852\nSo, I'm gonna put our super secret\npassword of, well, let's see.\n\n314\n00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:16.210\nLet's see if it will let me do this.\n\n315\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.370\nSame thing for my luggage here.\n\n316\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.870\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n317\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.370\nAnd we're gonna see if\nit'll save that setting.\n\n318\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.240\nWe'll apply the settings.\n\n319\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.870\nNow, that's another good thing here.\n\n320\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.830\nNotice that it has Save Settings and\nit has Apply Settings.\n\n321\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.600\nSave Settings is saving\nthe configuration file, but it's not\n\n322\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.960\ndoing what the next button would seem\nlike applying it to the configuration.\n\n323\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.930\nSo I'm,\nbe careful as you'll go through these.\n\n324\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.310\nRemember, we were doing some\nbasic settings here and\n\n325\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:46.060\nwe set up the mixed mode, oh,\nactually we didn't, I didn't.\n\n326\n00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.790\nAnd I changed the SSID to FBI VAN.\n\n327\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.270\nSo I wanna go ahead and\nsave those settings.\n\n328\n00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.700\nBecause a lot of times these pages\nwill refresh, all right, and\n\n329\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.070\nwhen they refresh, unfortunately, like\nyou've just seen, those settings are gone.\n\n330\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.310\nSo, one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n331\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.257\n>> So\nyou make a change to the setting, and\n\n332\n00:17:10.257 --> 00:17:13.271\nthen you hit Save to make sure\nthe configuration is changed.\n\n333\n00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:13.851\n>> Yep.\n\n334\n00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:14.771\n>> But it hasn't applied.\n\n335\n00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:16.630\nThat's why they have Apply Settings.\n\n336\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.220\nAnd it can be a little confusing.\n\n337\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.180\nBut you don't wanna apply the settings\nuntil you're ready to apply the settings.\n\n338\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.558\nCuz if I'm making changes to the SSID\nname, and the encryption type, and\n\n339\n00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:28.571\nthe passwords that I'm logged in,\nwell it's gonna kick me out.\n\n340\n00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:33.170\nAnd then I can't, I have to log back\nin and I continue my configuration.\n\n341\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.810\nAnd every time I hit Apply Settings I'm\ngonna get kicked out and\n\n342\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.310\nI'm gonna have to do the same\nthing over and over again.\n\n343\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.470\nSo here you can make widespread changes,\nsave them, and\n\n344\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.770\nthen when you're done,\nyou hit Apply Changes.\n\n345\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.310\n>> And that's a good thing,\nwhen you're configuring your access point,\n\n346\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.380\nthat's another good reason to be wired in,\nrather than hitting your wireless network.\n\n347\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.680\nBecause I can't tell you how\nmany times I've done that.\n\n348\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.520\nWhere I apply a change and\nthe change, my wireless adapter on\n\n349\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.860\nmy card wasn't ready for the change and\nit kicks me off, I have to reenter and\n\n350\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.190\nreconfigure my network adapter\nto connect back to the network.\n\n351\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.390\nSo that's another good reason to just hard\nwire in there because you're not worried\n\n352\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.390\nabout connecting to the wireless\nwhen you apply these settings.\n\n353\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:16.030\nNow if you want to,\nyou can also enable MAC filtering.\n\n354\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.150\nMAC filtering,\nyou can use a prevent or permit.\n\n355\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.930\nSo white list versus black list.\n\n356\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.030\nIf you black list and\nthese are not allowed on.\n\n357\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.720\nAnd if you white list,\nonly these are allowed on.\n\n358\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.990\nKeep in mind that it is one thing that you\ncan add with disabling the SSID broadcast.\n\n359\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.620\nThat you can say, okay, I know that I\nonly have a certain set of computers that\n\n360\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.740\nare gonna be here, so I'm just gonna\nallow only these MAC addresses.\n\n361\n00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.070\nNow, keep in mind that that'll\nstart to get a little bit tough to\n\n362\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.050\nmanage if you talk about a lot of mobile\ndevices that you might wanna connect and\n\n363\n00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.290\ndisconnect from your network.\n\n364\n00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.550\nIf you enable a strict MAC\nfiltering that does this,\n\n365\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.460\nonly the people on this list\nare allowed to connect.\n\n366\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.950\nWell that means every mobile device,\nand I'm including like cell\n\n367\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.040\nphones on this too,\nthey connect to your wireless network.\n\n368\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.680\nYou're gonna have to go into the device.\n\n369\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.840\nYou're gonna have to find\nthat 48 bit MAC address and\n\n370\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.730\nyou're gonna have to come back here and\nenter it into the access point.\n\n371\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.310\nSo when we increase our\nsecurity sometimes we also\n\n372\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.020\nincrease the administrative overhead\nto keep the network running.\n\n373\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.140\nSo just be careful if you are gonna\nuse this because it does take\n\n374\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.340\na moderate amount of administration to\nmake sure that it's implemented correctly.\n\n375\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.880\nAll right, so that's got us set up for\nour wireless security.\n\n376\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.770\nIt's got us set up if we were\ngonna use MAC filtering.\n\n377\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.560\nThere are some other things that we\nalso need to consider here, too.\n\n378\n00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.120\nYou've got some different\nservices that you can set up, and\n\n379\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.220\nyou can see things like\nyour MAC tables here.\n\n380\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.490\nIf you're setting up things\nlike VPN communications,\n\n381\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:52.070\nthis one actually offers you the ability\nto create a PPTP server, if you want.\n\n382\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.285\nIf you're not using these, you don't\nreally have to configure them, so\n\n383\n00:19:55.285 --> 00:19:58.445\nI wouldn't worry too much about\nthem if you're not gonna use them.\n\n384\n00:19:58.445 --> 00:20:01.765\nSome of the things that you can also do,\nimagine being able to connect to your\n\n385\n00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:07.495\nwireless access point and having access\nto things like, for instance, your files.\n\n386\n00:20:07.495 --> 00:20:12.545\nWell, you can also, sometimes\nthese devices will have extra USB\n\n387\n00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:16.865\nports that you can plug in\nlike a 1 terabyte USB device.\n\n388\n00:20:16.865 --> 00:20:18.215\nAnd you can store things like movies or\n\n389\n00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:21.060\nfiles there,\nconnected to the back of the access point.\n\n390\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.080\nAnd then when you need\nto access those files,\n\n391\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.100\nyou're accessing them directly\noff the access point.\n\n392\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.880\nSo it's a really good thing\nif you have those files, or\n\n393\n00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.892\nif you need those files to\nhave them handy like that.\n\n394\n00:20:30.892 --> 00:20:34.246\nAll right, now, some of the more advanced,\n\n395\n00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:38.659\nI want to jump back here some\nmore of the advanced settings,\n\n396\n00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:44.241\nbecause there are some things that we\nhave to consider inside of wireless.\n\n397\n00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:46.390\nAnd those are the channels, all right?\n\n398\n00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.600\nWe've already talked about the fact\nthat when you have dual-band,\n\n399\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.480\nyou might have to set these up twice, but\n\n400\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.395\nyou also have to consider what\nchannel you're broadcasting on.\n\n401\n00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:59.545\nBecause of the fact that there\nare non overlapping channels,\n\n402\n00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:03.315\ninside of the 2.4 gigahertz\nspectrum you have 1, 6, and 11.\n\n403\n00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:08.000\nAnd if you leave the defaults,\na lot of it, if for\n\n404\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.160\ninstance, you're in an apartment complex,\nsometimes people will leave the defaults.\n\n405\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.920\nThey'll set them up and\nthey just say go ahead and\n\n406\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.120\nwe'll just allow the channels to\ndo what they want automatically.\n\n407\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.130\nSo let's go ahead and, let's switch\nback over to the access point and\n\n408\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.240\nmake sure that our channels\nare where we expect them to be.\n\n409\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.710\nNow, by default, you're going to see,\nthere isn't any channel selected here.\n\n410\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.660\nWe've got this wireless channel\nsection here, but it's on auto.\n\n411\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.800\nAnd that's where the problem starts.\n\n412\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.670\nIf people don't change\nthe auto configuration,\n\n413\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.520\nit's gonna default to whatever\nthinks that it should default.\n\n414\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.480\nSo let's go ahead and look at this.\n\n415\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.030\nNow, you've got a whole bunch of options.\n\n416\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.430\nYou've actually got 11 options,\n\n417\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:53.690\nand these are the individual 11 channels\nthat are available in that ISM band.\n\n418\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.940\nAnd there are three of them that do not\noverlap, and that's important just from\n\n419\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.960\na performance stand point, making sure\nyou don't get channel congestion.\n\n420\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.300\nNow in our wireless\nanalyzer we see that a lot\n\n421\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.590\nof them are sitting right\nthere at channel 11.\n\n422\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.100\nSo if I was to put this one on channel\n11 or leave it at the defaults and\n\n423\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.640\nit is on channel 11 by default on that\nauto configuration, well now I've got\n\n424\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.320\nmaybe the seventh device on channel 11 and\nnow we're all in contention so\n\n425\n00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.070\nthat could definitely cause some\nperformance degradation there.\n\n426\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.290\nSo I think what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n427\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.140\ndo, I noticed that when our\nwireless spectrum analyzed or\n\n428\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.330\nwireless analyzer there,\nthere weren't a lot of devices on one.\n\n429\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.840\nWe had a handful of devices on six.\n\n430\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.740\nWe had a whole bunch of them on 11.\n\n431\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.070\nBut we didn't have maybe one or two on\nthe channel one here so we're going to go\n\n432\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.660\nahead and switch this up to channel\none and we can save that setting.\n\n433\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:53.260\nAlright, now we should, for the most part,\nwe have our wireless network configured.\n\n434\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.130\nWe have some of the basic configurations\nready and set where we want them.\n\n435\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.340\nOne of the things that you will still have\nto look at, some additional things that\n\n436\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.790\nif you want to set up things like gaming\nand stuff you can also do dynamic DNS.\n\n437\n00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.000\nBut you really want to\nverify your WAN link.\n\n438\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.620\nNow, I don't have a WAN link, I don't\nactually have this plugged into an ISPs\n\n439\n00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.680\nnetwork, but remember that you're gonna\nbe connecting to your ISP's network so,\n\n440\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.530\nthat IP address, if you see what\nyou see here it is a 0.0.0.0.\n\n441\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.480\nYou might have to reboot the router\nwhere you shut the router down and\n\n442\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.755\nyou turn it back on,\n\n443\n00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:33.765\na lot of times what it'll do is it'll\nconnect to your Internet service provider.\n\n444\n00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:37.295\nAnd then one of the things, finally,\nthat you have to do to make sure that this\n\n445\n00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:41.585\nrouter is where you need it to\nbe is to take a wireless device,\n\n446\n00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:46.025\nconnect it to it, enter the password,\ndouble check your password.\n\n447\n00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:48.830\nMake sure that you got it entered\nright because if you don't\n\n448\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.330\nconnect the first time it could\nbe that the password is wrong,\n\n449\n00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.830\nverify that it is going to hand out some\nIP addresses if that's what you need.\n\n450\n00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.000\nYou can always tell if you, if you\nenter the password right but then you\n\n451\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.360\ndon't have a connection there it could be\nthe fact that you have disabled the DHCP.\n\n452\n00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.480\nSo for the most part,\nif you've connected to it,\n\n453\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.920\nyou've done your configurations on it.\n\n454\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.380\nYou've configured your wireless network,\nyour SSID, your security settings and\n\n455\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.685\nyou definitely want\nyour security settings.\n\n456\n00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:20.635\nVerify that it's connected\nto the WAN interface,\n\n457\n00:24:20.635 --> 00:24:22.955\nwhich is basically your ISPs network.\n\n458\n00:24:22.955 --> 00:24:24.195\nOnce that's done,\n\n459\n00:24:24.195 --> 00:24:27.875\nyou can try to connect a device to\nthe wireless network just by joining it,\n\n460\n00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:31.790\nentering the password, and verifying that\nyou can maybe connect to the internet,\n\n461\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.420\nmaybe connect to your favorite game or\nyour blog or something like that.\n\n462\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.230\nWhatever you use your home network for and\n\n463\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.050\nonce you have a connection there,\nyou should be good to go.\n\n464\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.090\nYou should be ready to go\ninside of your network.\n\n465\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.620\nIf not, then you're just gonna\nwant to step back a few,\n\n466\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.800\ntry a whole troubleshooting method.\n\n467\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.440\nStart back with step one and make sure\nthat your configurations are right.\n\n468\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.050\nAnd one of the major things,\nmake sure you apply the settings.\n\n469\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.920\nYou don't wanna go through\nall the configurations and\n\n470\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.590\nthen log out of your configuration page\nand wonder why, well nothing's working.\n\n471\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.190\nIt could have been the fact that you\ndidn't apply those settings right.\n\n472\n00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.560\nAlso make sure that, if you are gonna\ndo configurations, it's a good idea to\n\n473\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.220\nplug directly into the router so that\nwhen you do apply the settings it doesn't\n\n474\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.250\ndisconnect you from your network and\nlock you out of your access point.\n\n475\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.510\nThat right there should have you ready\nto go and you should be good to go\n\n476\n00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.050\non the inside of your network next\ntime you need to connect to it.\n\n477\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.307\n>> Yeah, awesome stuff, Wes.\n\n478\n00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:27.030\nYou would think this would\nbe a much simpler process.\n\n479\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.700\nAnd to leave all those other\nconfigurations, it is, but\n\n480\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.560\nit's not the best way to do it.\n\n481\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.680\nSo you'll wanna get in there,\nlook at that documentation.\n\n482\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.730\nTake a lot of Wes's advice here,\n\n483\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.120\nespecially when it comes to that channel,\nbecause the great thing about that is if\n\n484\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.600\nyou're on a channel that gets super\nsaturated, well, you can go in there and\n\n485\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.480\nchange the channel that's it's\non to something that's it's not.\n\n486\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.370\nAnd you can do that every time you\nfeel like maybe you're having a little\n\n487\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.360\nnetwork contention.\n\n488\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.210\nA very nice little tip or trick there.\n\n489\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:55.190\nAnd I also, leave it to old pros here, I\nguarantee Wes, you have done this before.\n\n490\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.761\nYou configure these things and\nit doesn't work, right?\n\n491\n00:25:57.761 --> 00:25:58.970\n>> Right.\n>> Just like Wes said,\n\n492\n00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.510\nsometimes the best idea,\njust start from square one.\n\n493\n00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.451\nI like to just just grab that\nballpoint pen and hit the reset button\n\n494\n00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:04.570\n>> Yep.\n\n495\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.860\n>> And\nmake sure I get my settings all correct.\n\n496\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.510\nIf you're going through that process and\n\n497\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.710\neverything has been verifies you\nshould be connected after that.\n\n498\n00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.042\nWes, thank you so much for-\n>> Yeah.\n\n499\n00:26:13.042 --> 00:26:14.640\n>> That demonstration\n>> I appreciate it, man.\n\n500\n00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.790\n>> How we do this.\n\n501\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.400\nIt's something we all\ndefinitely need to know and\n\n502\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.010\nit's gonna serve us well in the future.\n\n503\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off foe this episode for IT Pro TV.\n\n504\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.130\nIve been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n505\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.940\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n506\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.721\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n507\n00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:32.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.980\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.220\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\n\n6\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.860\njoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.090\nHow you doing today Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.990\n>> I'm doing good, Dan.\n\n9\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.910\nIt's great to be here today and here with\nthe IT Pro TV crew, and today we get to\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.090\ntalk about port forwarding, and what that\nmeans to us in our home environments.\n\n11\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.300\nHopefully by the end of this episode here,\nyou'll know a little bit more about\n\n12\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.900\nport forwarding, and how you can\nset it up on your router at home.\n\n13\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.050\nNow, why would we even\nneed port forwarding?\n\n14\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.470\nWell, really the problem comes from when\nyou lease your connection to the internet.\n\n15\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.670\nYour connection to the internet is\ntypically from an internet service\n\n16\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.620\nprovider, and\nwhen you get that connection,\n\n17\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.470\nit's usually through a single IP address.\n\n18\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.340\nWell, here's the problem.\n\n19\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.300\nA single IP address, this is what's\nknown as a public IP address,\n\n20\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.550\nthis is what the rest of\nthe world identifies you as.\n\n21\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.430\nNow, if you think about it,\n\n22\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.970\nbehind that home router a lot of times\nwhat you'll have is multiple computers.\n\n23\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.110\nHow is it that if I need a certain\npiece of traffic to go to my,\n\n24\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.640\nlet's say my gaming PC,\nhow do I differentiate it between all of\n\n25\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.970\nthose other computers on my home network,\nall through that single IP address?\n\n26\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.590\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at that here.\n\n27\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.190\nNow, you've got a gaming server over here,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.450\nThat gaming server is going to send\ninformation into your home router here.\n\n29\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.190\nNotice that your home router's\ngot that single IP Address, so\n\n30\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.340\nthe gaming server is going to send that\ninformation to that single IP Address.\n\n31\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.035\nThe problem is, well, what happens when\nwe look here behind the access point,\n\n32\n00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:53.335\nor behind the home router,\nwe've got a whole bunch of computers that\n\n33\n00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:56.205\nthey don't have the same IP\naddresses that we're looking at.\n\n34\n00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:58.205\nOr maybe you need to communicate,\n\n35\n00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.315\nmaybe you want to control your\ncomputer from your work environment.\n\n36\n00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:06.125\nMaybe back over the internet,\nback into your home network.\n\n37\n00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:11.620\nSo what we need to do, is we need a way\nthese services that are communicating\n\n38\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.370\nacross the Internet back into your home\nnetwork, they know exactly where to go.\n\n39\n00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.340\nNow, I want you to think of it as\nlike setting up an extension, right?\n\n40\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.250\nIf you've got a single phone number,\n1-800 whatever, and then it says for\n\n41\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.290\nthe extension you wanna call,\nyou can press it now.\n\n42\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.810\nWell, understand you only\ndialed a single number, and\n\n43\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.110\nthen you dial an extension\nout after the fact.\n\n44\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.310\nWell, that's what these\nservices are doing out here.\n\n45\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.780\nYou can think of them as putting\nextension information that's going\n\n46\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.830\ninto the home router, and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna tell the home router,\n\n47\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.140\nwell, hey when I see that gaming traffic,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n48\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.230\nWhere does it go?\n\n49\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.830\nAll right, and that's port\nforwarding essentially is for us.\n\n50\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.535\nIt's telling him, it's telling the home\nrouter, when you see this information,\n\n51\n00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:01.825\nnotice that little extension, we call it\na port, hence the name port forwarding.\n\n52\n00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:06.295\nSend it, not to every computer,\nnot to a couple computers, but\n\n53\n00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:12.570\nsend it to maybe just my gaming PC over\nhere and don't send it to anybody else.\n\n54\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.780\nNow let's go ahead, and\n\n55\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.200\nwhat we're going to do is we're\ngoing to look at that real quick.\n\n56\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.930\nNow I've actually logged into\nour router ahead of time so\n\n57\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.260\nwhen it comes to your home router,\njust pay attention to the specifics,\n\n58\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.740\ncheck the vender documentation,\ngo out to the manufacturers website,\n\n59\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480\ncuz everyone's gonna be\na little bit different.\n\n60\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.480\nI know that Asus 66 Router,\nAC router, I've got at the house,\n\n61\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.520\nit's a little bit different than this one.\n\n62\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.950\nAnd typically what you're gonna look for\n\n63\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.510\nis, like a QOS or\neven maybe a WAN interface.\n\n64\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.340\nAnd this one it just happens to\nbe on the Quality of Service tab.\n\n65\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160\nAnd you'll see that\nthere's port forwarding.\n\n66\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.460\nNow, the other thing that\nyou're gonna need for\n\n67\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.590\nthis is you're gonna have to go out and\n\n68\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.330\nyou're gonna have to figure out the ports\nfor a specific game, and you can do that.\n\n69\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.340\nFor instance, what we're gonna show you\nhere, and everybody might like this one,\n\n70\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.280\nwe're gonna show you setting\nup World of Warcraft, right?\n\n71\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.110\nMaybe you wanna play WoW and you wanna be\nable to connect, have the gaming servers\n\n72\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.210\nbe able to know where your gaming PC\nis on the inside of your network.\n\n73\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.910\nSo let's go ahead and set that up.\n\n74\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.940\nNow one of the very first\nthings that you do,\n\n75\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.490\nnotice I have no port\nforwarders here at all.\n\n76\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.860\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose Add, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.920\nAnd the application, understand that when\nyou're gonna name these port forwarding,\n\n78\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.990\nthey're like a rule.\n\n79\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.350\nWhat it says, it tells the router,\n\n80\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.530\nhey, when you receive this traffic and\nit has that port value,\n\n81\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.150\nthat extension on the end of it,\nI want you to send it to this end point.\n\n82\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.420\nSo make sure that when you're\nmaking these port forwarding rules,\n\n83\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.620\nthey're easily identifiable.\n\n84\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.320\nIf you ever need to go back and configure\nthem or troubleshoot them, you type\n\n85\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.660\na number wrong, you're gonna wanna know\nwhich rule that you have to modify.\n\n86\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.770\nSo I might say that this\nis just gonna be WoW.\n\n87\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.840\nAnd I might even do something like\nWoW dash one if you're gonna have\n\n88\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.430\nmultiple ports there.\n\n89\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.790\nAnd it's gonna ask you here,\ndo you wanna do TCP or UDP?\n\n90\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.170\nNow there's definitely a difference in\nthese, and you might need to use both, so\n\n91\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.170\nyou do have that option.\n\n92\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.160\nIn this case, the first one that\nI'm gonna do is for game play and\n\n93\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.400\nthat one, according to the website out\nthere, said that this is gonna be TCP.\n\n94\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.114\nNow we'll go ahead and we're going to,\n\n95\n00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.231\nlet's type the port here.\n\n96\n00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:22.573\nPort 3724.\n\n97\n00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:25.860\nAnd now we got to tell it which\ncomputer do we want it to go to.\n\n98\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.710\n>> Now Wes,\nare you picking a random port or\n\n99\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.925\nis this a port specific for this game,\nor how's this working with the ports?\n\n100\n00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:33.755\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n101\n00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:36.725\nA lot of times what these port values,\n\n102\n00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:41.235\nthere are different ranges that they have\naccording to specifications and standards.\n\n103\n00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:43.955\nAnd a lot of times you'll see that these\n\n104\n00:05:43.955 --> 00:05:46.870\nports are specific to\nthe applications themselves.\n\n105\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.430\nSo I've gone out to the website\nbeforehand to find out\n\n106\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.390\nwhat they're telling me this specific game\nis using and it uses various ports, so\n\n107\n00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.230\nyou have to be careful on that one and\nyou have to do a little bit of research.\n\n108\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.450\nA lot of times they'll have it well\ndocumented, of course, because they\n\n109\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.220\nwant you to connect, they don't want\nto keep that information cryptic and\n\n110\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.850\nthen you can't use the platform, well they\naren't going to make any money that way.\n\n111\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.649\nSo it is very specific.\n\n112\n00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.745\nNow we're going to tell it,\n\n113\n00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:20.039\nlet's say 192.168.1.15, oops.\n\n114\n00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.432\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:06:21.432 --> 00:06:25.640\nIt could just be a port range, but\nwe're just going to keep it port.\n\n116\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.190\nDid that a little bit wrong.\n\n117\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.300\nThat port is actually supposed to be 34.\n\n118\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.280\nWell, maybe I did have it right,\n7324, there we go.\n\n119\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.030\n>> Check your cheater.\n\n120\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.810\n>> Check your cheaters,\nthat's right, that's right.\n\n121\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.960\n>> Got a little chutzpah there.\n\n122\n00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.040\n>> That's right.\n\n123\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.160\nNow there's another thing to keep in mind,\nyou can save, you can add these and\n\n124\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.390\nyou have to enable them for\nthem to actually stay.\n\n125\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.980\nSo let me go ahead real quick.\n\n126\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.434\nWe'll do a WoW dash one and it looks\nlike it saved it for us, which is good.\n\n127\n00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:05.596\nThis just happens to be TCP here,\nthat's going to be 3724.\n\n128\n00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:08.196\nAnd it looks like it's filling it in for\nme here.\n\n129\n00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:13.650\nAnd then 3724, we'll choose enabled.\n\n130\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.940\nAnd we should be able\nto save that setting.\n\n131\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.520\nNow I've got that one ready.\n\n132\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.170\nMight want to change that\nname just a little bit.\n\n133\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.010\nKeep in mind that they should\nbe easily identifiable.\n\n134\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.250\nAnd you're gonna notice that,\nthere we go, you want\n\n135\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.160\nthem to be easily identifiable because\nyou can be using more than one name, or\n\n136\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.380\nmore than one protocol, or\nmore than one port here.\n\n137\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.160\nSo you want to be able to know\nwhich one you're setting.\n\n138\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.780\nNow it also uses another port, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.030\nAnd what's kind of\ninteresting on this one, Dan,\n\n140\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.130\nis I've got two separate ports here.\n\n141\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.490\nI could say,\n\n142\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.350\nyou know what the protocol that it's\ngonna use is gonna be both, TCP or UDP.\n\n143\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.680\nBut with this one you gotta\nbe a little more specific, or\n\n144\n00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.400\nlike a friend of mine used\nto say pacific [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.050\nBecause it uses TCP for game play.\n\n146\n00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.660\nIt uses UDP for the voice chat.\n\n147\n00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.790\nSo you do have two different\ntransport protocols that are going on\n\n148\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.080\nsimultaneously here.\n\n149\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.030\nSo in this one both would\nnot be a good option,\n\n150\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.270\nyou might get a little confusion here\nbecause it might see one rule and say,\n\n151\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.450\nokay, wait a second,\nwhat am I, this is UDP.\n\n152\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.885\nSo sometimes, you can get away with that,\nsometimes you can't,\n\n153\n00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:20.896\ncheck the documentation.\n\n154\n00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:26.422\nSo we'll go ahead, and this was easy,\ntoo, cuz it's 3724 as well,\n\n155\n00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:30.523\nand you're gonna wanna put\nyour endpoints there, and\n\n156\n00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:36.607\nthis is more specifically, what computer\nyou want to send this information to.\n\n157\n00:08:36.607 --> 00:08:43.167\nAnd we'll do the same thing, 192.168.1.15.\n\n158\n00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:47.151\nWe'll choose enable, we'll save the\nsettings, and I'm going to go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:51.434\napply these settings here and hopefully\nthe configurations, if we hold our breath,\n\n160\n00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:53.170\nright, won't change here.\n\n161\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.481\nNow notice that it didn't\nseem to save that port.\n\n162\n00:08:58.481 --> 00:09:01.360\nLet me make sure that\nit's gonna configure.\n\n163\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.890\nOops, I didn't have that\nthe end port there.\n\n164\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.140\nYeah, you definitely gotta set that too.\n\n165\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.960\nLike I said,\nyou can set port ranges too, but\n\n166\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.200\nagain sometimes they're really specific.\n\n167\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.940\nThey don't say hey, well open up Port\n49,000 to I don't know 49,151 or\n\n168\n00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.520\nsomething like that, and\nthen some times they're not that generic.\n\n169\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.640\nNow what this is going to tell our home\nrouter is when you see information\n\n170\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.590\ncome from that game server, all right,\nand it comes into the access point,\n\n171\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.080\nthe access point's gonna use that port\nvalue like an extension that's gonna then\n\n172\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.005\nsay, now let's send this\ninformation to the IP address,\n\n173\n00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:44.780\n192.168.1.15.\n\n174\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.700\nNow anytime you set up these ports,\nyou might have additional services, and\n\n175\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.640\nthat's why the user friendly names\nare very, very good to have.\n\n176\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.380\nNow there's also another port\nthat you need to add as well,\n\n177\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.030\nnotice we got a few of them.\n\n178\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.160\nBecause it also updates,\nthere's an updater for content updates and\n\n179\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.150\nstuff that need to be set so\nthat you receive those updates too.\n\n180\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.150\nSo we've got things like gameplay,\nwe've got things like\n\n181\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.900\nvoice chat that need to be set up\nif you're gonna use the voice chat.\n\n182\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.770\nI know a lot of people use\nthird party voice chat apps so\n\n183\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.030\nyou might not need that.\n\n184\n00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.028\nSo let's go ahead and set up.\n\n185\n00:10:22.707 --> 00:10:25.000\nChange this out just a little bit.\n\n186\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.983\nMake sure that I'm practicing\nwhat I preach here.\n\n187\n00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:34.824\nAnd this one just happens to be TCP and\n\n188\n00:10:34.824 --> 00:10:39.245\nthat is port 1119.\n\n189\n00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:43.005\nAnd again, we'll set up our IP addresses,\n\n190\n00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:48.185\nmaking sure that we have the right\nend point so that it knows,\n\n191\n00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:54.093\nthe router knows hey, when you see\nthis information, send it here.\n\n192\n00:10:54.093 --> 00:10:59.540\nAnd I'm gonna put that import there too,\nand we'll save the settings on that.\n\n193\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.280\nSo now if everything is set up all right\nand you have paid your internet bill,\n\n194\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.820\nthat's another thing we\nprobably should say,\n\n195\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.890\nwe should be able to receive that\ninformation, the gameplay, the updates,\n\n196\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.100\nand even the voice chat for\nsomething like World of Warcraft.\n\n197\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.110\n>> Yeah, that's really awesome that we can\ntake that one IP address that we get from\n\n198\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.060\nour service provider and say, yeah,\nI know that all my devices really need\n\n199\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.140\ntheir own external IP address\nto be able to see my internet.\n\n200\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.970\nBut you know what I'm not gonna do that.\n\n201\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.330\nI'm gonna kinda cheat\nthe system a little bit and\n\n202\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.150\nallow me to have one IP address,\nand have that device say oh,\n\n203\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.410\nI see a request coming in, and\nit's got a port number on it.\n\n204\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:38.990\nAnd you know what?\n\n205\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.620\nThat port is in a nice little defined\ntable here, little database of different\n\n206\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.970\nmachines for their specific reasons, and\nI see that that port goes to this machine,\n\n207\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.400\nI'll go ahead and forward that along to\nthat device inside my internal network.\n\n208\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.040\nPort forwarding is great.\n\n209\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.610\nI love it, especially for being able to\n\n210\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.420\nremote desktop in to my PCs at home\nfrom work if I need to make a change.\n\n211\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.030\nIf I wanted to do something\nthat was maybe personal and\n\n212\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.080\nI didn't want to have it on the work\nnetwork or if I'm at a Starbucks or\n\n213\n00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.970\nsomething like that, I'm on a separate\nnetwork than my home network.\n\n214\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.430\nI can get right in because I'm using\nport forwarding, allows me to do that.\n\n215\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.732\nWes, this is awesome stuff.\n\n216\n00:12:15.732 --> 00:12:19.730\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's one of the reasons this is so\n\n217\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.520\nefficient is because really when we things\nlike network address translation that we\n\n218\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.210\ncan talk about at another time,\nit really is using these\n\n219\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.670\nport values in the background to\ndifferentiate those internal computers.\n\n220\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.840\nYou're already working in its ball park.\n\n221\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.050\nYou're already working where\nit knows what it's doing.\n\n222\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.870\nSo, what you're saying here is you're just\nkind of modifying it a little and saying,\n\n223\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.890\nwell, rather than let it do the work for\nyou,\n\n224\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.170\nyou're saying this is\nwhat I want you to do.\n\n225\n00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.110\nSo if we look here on my computer,\n\n226\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.050\nnow every time the gaming server needs to\nsend information, notice the gaming server\n\n227\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.280\nout there on the Internet,\nit only sees that public IP address.\n\n228\n00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.070\nIt doesn't know of anything behind your\nnetwork, and so what you're basically\n\n229\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.910\nset is that when that gaming traffic\ncomes into the router, where does it go?\n\n230\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.905\nWell we're gonna forward in the IP\naddress I've got here [LAUGH].\n\n231\n00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:08.425\nWe're gonna forward it\nto the wrong computer.\n\n232\n00:13:08.425 --> 00:13:11.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So in this case, we're gonna forward\n\n233\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:17.070\nit to that 192.168.15 address and\nit's going to let that router know\n\n234\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.110\nevery time that information comes in,\nlet's go ahead and send it there.\n\n235\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.790\nBut maybe you wanna set up\nsomething like remote desktop and\n\n236\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.940\nyou wanna be able to control\nyour computer at the house.\n\n237\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.580\nWell, you can set that up here too,\n\n238\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.400\nbecause every service that needs\nto go to a specific computer,\n\n239\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.360\nyou have to tell the router this is\nwhere I wanna send that information.\n\n240\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.370\nSo you have to make sure that,\n\n241\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.230\nif you have multiple services,\neach service gets configured correctly.\n\n242\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.350\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n243\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.110\nLet's set up our remote\ndesktop protocol here.\n\n244\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.910\nSo we're gonna add another\nport forward rule here.\n\n245\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.230\nWe might just call this RDP.\n\n246\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.910\nMakes it easy here.\n\n247\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.310\nAll right, and we're gonna use\ntransmission control protocol on this one.\n\n248\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.100\nAnd pay attention to\nthe vendor's documentation.\n\n249\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.320\nI just know this one off the top of\nmy head because I use it as well.\n\n250\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.430\nPay attention to the vendor's\ndocumentation on what port specifically\n\n251\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.710\nthat it's gonna be listening out to.\n\n252\n00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.580\nIn this case with the RDP and\nthe remote desktop,\n\n253\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.314\nit's gonna be using I believe port 3389.\n\n254\n00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.058\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n255\n00:14:17.058 --> 00:14:17.847\n>> Port 3389.\n\n256\n00:14:17.847 --> 00:14:19.040\n>> That's the number.\n\n257\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.620\n>> I always get that one and\nlightweight directory access protocol,\n\n258\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.420\nbecause it's port 389.\n\n259\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.070\nSo you've gotta be careful with that.\n\n260\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.940\n>> That's right.\n\n261\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.720\n>> You put something, just that one\nthree can cause this not to work at all.\n\n262\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.822\n>> That's been verified, right?\n\n263\n00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:33.019\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> And, you know what,\nto keep it consistent I think I'm gonna\n\n264\n00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:35.578\nupdate every single one of\nmy port forwarding rules.\n\n265\n00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:40.803\nTo the right IP addresses,\nbased on my diagram.\n\n266\n00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:42.893\nLet's keep in consistent.\n\n267\n00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:46.330\nAll right, end port, port 3389.\n\n268\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.130\nWe're gonna enable this and\nwe're gonna apply the settings.\n\n269\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.720\nAnd hopefully, now what we'll\nsee is when we come back here,\n\n270\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.150\nif you do have this work computer that\nyou need to get that information into\n\n271\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.780\na specific computer on the inside of your\nnetwork, comes out across the network or\n\n272\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.810\ninternet I should say,\nhits your home router,\n\n273\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.580\nyour home router like Dan says looks at\nthat cable and says, where is this going?\n\n274\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.470\nWhat extension or\nport are we looking for, and\n\n275\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.470\nhopefully it will get you out\nthere to the right computer.\n\n276\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.680\nAnd notice the IP address is still wrong.\n\n277\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.251\n>> Yes, [CROSSTALK] consistent here.\n\n278\n00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.590\n>> Hey, that's right, very good.\n\n279\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.639\nchange that up a little bit.\n\n281\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.982\nNetwork documentation's a fabulous thing,\nisn't it?\n\n282\n00:15:27.982 --> 00:15:28.562\n>> Very, very helpful.\n\n283\n00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:31.390\n>> [LAUGH] Do as I say, not as I do.\n\n284\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.020\n>> That's right.\n\n285\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.140\n>> And we'll apply the settings and\nhopefully, if we've got everything\n\n286\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.150\nset up right in the router,\nwe've got the computers configured right.\n\n287\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.030\nKeep in mind if this\ndoesn't work right away for\n\n288\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.180\nyou, double check your IP addresses.\n\n289\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.940\nDouble check the software too,\njust because you've opened up\n\n290\n00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.410\nthese forwarders doesn't necessarily mean\nthe software is configured correctly.\n\n291\n00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.750\nSo if it doesn't work Don't just assume\nthat you've done the configuration's\n\n292\n00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.360\nwrong.\n\n293\n00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.600\nCome back in here and\ncheck them like I just did.\n\n294\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.080\nI had to change some IP addresses.\n\n295\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.410\nAnd then, check to documentation for\nthe software and you should be good to go.\n\n296\n00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.250\nAnd, ultimately, at the end of the day,\nyou get to play your games or\n\n297\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.570\nmanage your work computers.\n\n298\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.320\nLike I said,\n\n299\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.390\nif you do that, most of us are probably\ngonna be doing the whole gaming.\n\n300\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.410\nBut that should have you set up,\nready to go.\n\n301\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.440\nAnd port forwarding,\npretty straightforward process,\n\n302\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.090\nnot too difficult.\n\n303\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.280\n>> Yeah,\nnothing really too difficult about this.\n\n304\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.900\nYou know your IPs.\n\n305\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.320\nYou know what port it's gonna be on.\n\n306\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.270\nYou set that forwarder up and\nyou're off to the races.\n\n307\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.950\nWes, that was an excellent demonstration.\n\n308\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:30.753\nWe thank you for that.\n\n309\n00:16:30.753 --> 00:16:33.980\nIs there anything else we would need\nto know about port forwarding before we\n\n310\n00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.603\ncall it a day?\n\n311\n00:16:34.603 --> 00:16:39.080\n>> No, no, just big thing is, everyone's\ngonna be just a little bit different.\n\n312\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.670\nDifferent tabs on the web configuration\npages, so if you get in there and you say,\n\n313\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.260\nWes, I don't see any NatQOS, it might\nbe on something completely different.\n\n314\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.210\nSo just check the documentation to\nwhatever the vendor is that you have, and\n\n315\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.950\nyou should be good.\n\n316\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.500\n>> All right.\n\n317\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.880\nWell, thank you so much for that.\n\n318\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.140\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n319\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.960\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n320\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.530\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n321\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.097\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n322\n00:16:59.097 --> 00:17:01.396\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n323\n00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:08.039\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
