00:00:18.830\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.640\nAnd today we're doing HTML,\nCSS, and Bootstrap.\n\n5\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd with me today is our\nsubject matter expert Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.490\nVictor Moreno from\nthe Florida Vocational Institute.\n\n7\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.680\nHow you doing Victor?\n\n8\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.470\n>> I'm doing great Mike.\n\n9\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.930\nThanks for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680\nSo we're gonna be talking,\nas you said, about HTML, CSS and\n\n11\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.510\nBootstrap, so let's talk about\nhow the course is going to be.\n\n12\n00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.420\nIn short HTML is how you set up the\nstructure of webpages, CSS is how you set\n\n13\n00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.207\nup the style and Bootstrap is like\na professional library with a bunch of\n\n14\n00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:49.830\npre-made CSS and JavaScript to\nreally speed up your development.\n\n15\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.661\nAnd the reason we are including it here is\nbecause we wanna take you from not just\n\n16\n00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.726\nlearning the basics but being able to put\nsomething that looks very professional,\n\n17\n00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.550\nlooks real good, together.\n\n18\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.590\nAnd we want you also speed up your\nlearning by using these tools and\n\n19\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.310\nseeing how things are done\nin a professional way.\n\n20\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.340\nSo today,\n\n21\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.750\nin this particular episode, we're\ngonna be explaining what a website is.\n\n22\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.600\nSo we're gonna be giving some\ncontext to all the stuff that we're\n\n23\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.030\ngonna be learning later on.\n\n24\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.160\nWe will also introduce you to the two main\ntools that you're also gonna need to use\n\n25\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.910\nto do any kind of web development.\n\n26\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.918\nSo that's your text editor is\ngonna be your best friend.\n\n27\n00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.630\nAnd looking under the hood of your\nbrowser, that's not something\n\n28\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.520\nthat a lot of people have done,\nlooking on the hood of their browser.\n\n29\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.960\nSo let's talk about what a webpage is.\n\n30\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.850\nIf you look at my computer real quick for\na second.\n\n31\n00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.264\nI already have the ITPro.TV\nwebsite loaded, but\n\n32\n00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:48.425\nif I were to type here, itpro.tv.\n\n33\n00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.035\nWhat I'm really doing is I'm\ninstructing my web browser to send\n\n34\n00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:54.235\nan HTTP request to a server.\n\n35\n00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:58.655\nAnd you IT guys know a lot better than me\nhow that happens, how it ends up with DNS,\n\n36\n00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.655\nall this stuff, making it there.\n\n37\n00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:03.655\nAnd I receive the response back,\nbut that's what I'm really doing.\n\n38\n00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:09.130\nI'm just using software in a graphical\nway to send a request to this web server.\n\n39\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.120\nSo, let's look under the hood\nof the browser, right here.\n\n40\n00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.680\nThese errors are just some add-ons that I\nhave that I block a bunch of content, and\n\n41\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.240\nthis is how you block that.\n\n42\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.490\n>> Now, how did you pull that up so\nwe could.\n\n43\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.020\n>> Yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.150\nThanks, good question.\n\n45\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.310\nSo, the easiest way to remember\nis basically to right-click\n\n46\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.780\nanywhere on the page.\n\n47\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.980\nAnd then you can click on Inspect.\n\n48\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.460\nOkay, so that'll bring up this panel\nthat has a bunch of tabs right here.\n\n49\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.480\nAnd the way that I did it,\nonce you get used to it you hit F12.\n\n50\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.630\nThere's a command for Mac,\n\n51\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.210\nI think it's Cmd-Option-I, but don't quote\nme on that I'm not a hundred percent sure.\n\n52\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.010\nBut F12 is how you do it on PCs.\n\n53\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.230\nSo let's take a look at what happens.\n\n54\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.170\nSo look at when I typed itprotv,\n\n55\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.290\nbasically what happened is I\ngot all of this stuff back.\n\n56\n00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:59.690\nAll of this code, all of this source code\nright here, that's what I got back and\n\n57\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.500\nmy browser's the one who basically reads\nthrough all of that stuff, lays it out,\n\n58\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.780\nfigures out what it is,\nfigures out what images it needs to load,\n\n59\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.430\nfigures out what stashes it needs to load.\n\n60\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.180\nAll these things it\nneeds to do in order for\n\n61\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.240\nme to have this nice,\nawesome-looking website.\n\n62\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.190\nAnd if we go to the Networking pane here,\n\n63\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.030\nwe can actually see\nthat process in action.\n\n64\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.400\nSo I'm just gonna hit Refresh here.\n\n65\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.770\nAnd if I expand my whole\nDeveloper Tools right here, look at\n\n66\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.710\nall the stuff that actually happened\nas a result of me typing itprotv.com.\n\n67\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.710\nI'm hitting Enter.\n\n68\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.530\n>> So\nmuch more than a single request going out,\n\n69\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.430\nthere's actually a lot of things\ngoing on in the background there.\n\n70\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.850\n>> Exactly because what happens is, once\nyou get that response, that source code,\n\n71\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.500\nthis was the original request right?\n\n72\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.760\nI get this response, this source code.\n\n73\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.940\n>> This source code might\ncause additional requests.\n\n74\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.010\nSo it might pull up a bunch of scripts, it\nmight pull up a bunch of CSS style sheets,\n\n75\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.070\na bunch of images.\n\n76\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.640\nAnd each additional\nasset that you request,\n\n77\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.750\nit actually has to get\nloaded individually.\n\n78\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.170\nSo as the browser goes line by line,\nfrom top to bottom running the HTML,\n\n79\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.490\nit might find an image\nthat it needs to load.\n\n80\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.230\nSo it goes and\nsends a request for the image.\n\n81\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.230\nIt might find a style sheet that it needs\nto load, it goes and sends the request for\n\n82\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.780\nthat style sheet.\n\n83\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.040\nMaybe it finds a YouTube video\nthat it needs to load, so\n\n84\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.000\nit sends the request to YouTube,\nto load in that video.\n\n85\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.380\nAnd as we can see right here,\nthis is a script, another script,\n\n86\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.710\nJW player, a bunch of scripts.\n\n87\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.230\nYou guys got a lot of\ncoding going on here.\n\n88\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.010\n>> We do [LAUGH].\n>> We have a PNG image and so on.\n\n89\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.970\nSo this is basically what happens\nwhen you're sending a request.\n\n90\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.884\nYou're really asking for a bunch of source\ncode and then you're your browser is\n\n91\n00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:38.550\nlooking through that source code\npulling up any additional resources.\n\n92\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.440\nAnd once it has everything put together,\nit does all this magic and\n\n93\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.940\nputs this nice little layout for you.\n\n94\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.640\n>> And normally pretty darn quick, too.\n\n95\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.012\n>> Yeah yeah, absolutely.\n\n96\n00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:50.830\nAnd as internet gets faster and\nfaster, this gets better and better.\n\n97\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.200\nAnd furthermore, as developers get\nsavvier and savvier, they can find ways\n\n98\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.130\nto package all the images in one,\npackage all their scripts in one so\n\n99\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.630\nthat If you have multiple programs\nthen you can only send one request.\n\n100\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.254\nBecause the developer did the job of\npackaging them all into one you only need\n\n101\n00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:08.870\nto fire one request,\nget one response and it's fast.\n\n102\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.910\n>> Very cool!\n\n103\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.350\n>> So, the next thing that I wanted\nto show you besides that network.\n\n104\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.844\nWell if you actually click on any of these\nrequests you can see the request headers\n\n105\n00:05:20.844 --> 00:05:22.310\nand the response itself.\n\n106\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.140\nWell the response in this case was\na script so I don't see it there.\n\n107\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.040\nBut you can see details about here, so,\n\n108\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.460\nnext place I wanted to take\nyou to is the console.\n\n109\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.130\nSo the console is where you're going to\nbe able to see any errors that happen.\n\n110\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.110\nLater on when you get into JavaScript,\n\n111\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.550\nthe console is going to be\nyour absolute best friend.\n\n112\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.030\nFor now, your console is going to be\n\n113\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.730\nthe main way that you realize\nthat something is not loading.\n\n114\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.110\nSo let's say that later on\nwere creating an HTML file,\n\n115\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.810\nwe create a link from that\nHTML file to a style sheet.\n\n116\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.220\nAnd we type out something.\n\n117\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.350\nWe did something wrong.\n\n118\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.450\nIn here is where that error\nwould come up telling you hey,\n\n119\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.940\nI couldn't find that style sheet\nyou were telling me about.\n\n120\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.480\nAnd then we would know to fix it.\n\n121\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.860\nAnd the other place that I wanted to\ntake you to is the Elements pane.\n\n122\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.610\nSo the Elements pane is very important\nwhen we're creating html layouts.\n\n123\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.480\nBecause, what it allows you to do is,\nvisually, you can inspect the page.\n\n124\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.620\nSo, let's say that I was editing this.\n\n125\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.880\nThis is a pretty complex page, but let's\nsay that there was a simpler page and\n\n126\n00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.300\nI could, right-click here, Inspect.\n\n127\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.940\nAnd it would take me\nstraight to that element.\n\n128\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.034\nAnd by mousing over it,\n\n129\n00:06:23.034 --> 00:06:25.840\nI can see the visual representation\nright there on the page.\n\n130\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.106\nSo I can navigate which element is\nwhich just by mousing over here.\n\n131\n00:06:31.106 --> 00:06:31.664\n>> Very cool.\n\n132\n00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:35.288\n>> So yeah, we're gonna be getting\ninto a lot more detail into that.\n\n133\n00:06:35.288 --> 00:06:36.888\nThis panel, on the right, right here.\n\n134\n00:06:36.888 --> 00:06:41.848\nIt's all about CSS and it's pretty complex\nso we'll get into that when we get CSS.\n\n135\n00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:46.950\nI don't want to bombard with stuff\nhere about the Developer Tools.\n\n136\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.250\n>> Especially since a lot of\npeople haven't seen this before.\n\n137\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.782\nWhat I want to do now is take\n\n138\n00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:59.336\nyou to atom.io, sorry.\n\n139\n00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:03.320\nSo atom.io, that is the other element,\n\n140\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.380\nthe other best friend that I had spoken\nto you about, that's your text editor.\n\n141\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.400\nSo Atom is maintained by GitHub.\n\n142\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.650\nGitHub is a very big and cool company.\n\n143\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.170\nEverybody uses their main product,\nwhich is a source control product.\n\n144\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.860\nIt basically used by coders to maintain\nversions of their source code and\n\n145\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.900\ncontrol the deployment\nof certain features.\n\n146\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.040\nControl the incorporation\nof certain features to\n\n147\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.140\nwhat they call the main branch.\n\n148\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.350\nSo in short, it's used by developers\nto collaborate with one another and\n\n149\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.430\nthey created this text editor, ATOM,\n\n150\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.470\nwhich is like the cool kid on the block\nright now, a lot of people are using it.\n\n151\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.520\n>> I actually use it on my\nMAC as my text editor for\n\n152\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.720\na lot of my show notes and stuff.\n\n153\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.290\n>> Absolutely.\n>> I love the color coding that it does.\n\n154\n00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.070\n>> Yeah right,\nthe color coding is awesome,\n\n155\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.870\nit does Markdown,\nit comes with a bunch of stuff.\n\n156\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.270\nThat's a huge open source community.\n\n157\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.621\nSo there's a ton of add-ons for it.\n\n158\n00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:58.773\nAnd if you want to install it as\na viewer you would go to atom.io.\n\n159\n00:07:58.773 --> 00:07:59.758\nClick on Download.\n\n160\n00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:02.393\nAnd one thing to know if\nyou're on a Windows machine,\n\n161\n00:08:02.393 --> 00:08:05.970\nI personally use Windows so this is\na word of advice for Windows users.\n\n162\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.200\nIt installs to the one profile, so\nit doesn't install machine-wide, and\n\n163\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.530\nthat's the main drawback\nthat it has I think.\n\n164\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.540\nIf you want something that installs\nmachine-wide because you want it for\n\n165\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.700\na lab setting or what-have-you.\n\n166\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.980\nLike if you, for students or for\na computer that's gonna be shared between\n\n167\n00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.430\nmultiple people, there's another open\nsource set of software made by Adobe and\n\n168\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.640\nit's called Brackets.\n\n169\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.170\nSo if you go to brackets.io, that's where\nyou can download that one and install it.\n\n170\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.600\nAnd that one does run,\n\n171\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.450\nthat one does install through old\nprofiles on the the computer.\n\n172\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.242\nSo, right now, what I'd like to do is\njust take you, show you, around an atom.\n\n173\n00:08:42.242 --> 00:08:45.098\nAnd explain a little bit\nabout what's going on there.\n\n174\n00:08:45.098 --> 00:08:49.260\nSo the way that you normally work with\nthese modern text editors like Atom,\n\n175\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.689\nBlack Brackets and even Sublime texts is\nanother one that's very popular is you\n\n176\n00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:56.188\nwant open a folder with it, so you want.\n\n177\n00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:58.960\nThe text editor will have a little\nfile panel on the left and\n\n178\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.730\nyou want that file panel to be looking\nat specific folder where all stuff for\n\n179\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.550\nyour website is gonna be.\n\n180\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:09.840\nSo I'm creating this new folder, and I'm\ngoing to call it like first HTML lesson.\n\n181\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.920\nAnother thing for\nnaming convention folders,\n\n182\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.180\nI think that you should stay away from\nspaces and stay away from capitals.\n\n183\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.070\nBecause when you type URLs,\nyou type website addresses.\n\n184\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.090\nThat stuff is,\nespecially the path after the domain name,\n\n185\n00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.510\nthat stuff is gonna be case-sensitive for\nthe most part, in most cases.\n\n186\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.390\nAnd you don't want to confuse\nyourself having capital letters, and\n\n187\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.317\nthen if there's a space,\nyou have to type %20.\n\n188\n00:09:31.317 --> 00:09:32.130\nIt gets messy.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.420\n>> So let's just not name anything\n\n190\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:33.990\nwith spaces.\n\n191\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.570\nWhen it comes to web design, no spaces and\n\n192\n00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.700\ntry to stay away from capitals as far\nas naming your files and folders go.\n\n193\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.210\nSo once I have that, if you have Atom\ninstalled, you can right-click that and\n\n194\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.250\nI also have Visual Studio Code, and\nit's also another awesome text editor.\n\n195\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.310\nBut I'm going to open it with Atom and\n\n196\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:58.420\nit's going to come up in a second and\nhere it shows me my folder and it's empty.\n\n197\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.553\nSo I can right click here and\ncreate a new file and call it index.html.\n\n198\n00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:09.352\nAnd the reason that we call it\nindex.html is because one of the most\n\n199\n00:10:09.352 --> 00:10:12.363\npopular servers that's used is Apache.\n\n200\n00:10:12.363 --> 00:10:16.986\nAnd Apache will, once you upload an\nindex.html to a folder in the Apache path,\n\n201\n00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:20.643\nso to speak, I don't wanna get\ntoo much into Apache right now,\n\n202\n00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:25.230\nit'll automatically pick up any file\nindex.html and serve that file.\n\n203\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.660\nSo it's a good convention to\ncall your home pages index.html.\n\n204\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.010\nIt'll make your life way easier when\nyou're deploying To our real server.\n\n205\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:38.490\nSo let's just, so that you see,\nI created this file in this panel,\n\n206\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.820\nbut that created a file in my\noperating system right here.\n\n207\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.440\nSo if I go into here I\nsee that index.html.\n\n208\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.890\n>> Nice.\n>> Right, and\n\n209\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.990\nI am going to type something here.\n\n210\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.220\nHello world, and\nthat's just something really simple.\n\n211\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.610\nHTML is just a file extension and well I\nam going to define what it is in a little\n\n212\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:03.040\nbit, but the point I want to make right\nnow is HTML files are plain text files,\n\n213\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.880\nso there's nothing special about Atom.\n\n214\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.800\nIt's not encoding anything special, it's\nnot like Microsoft Word that, you know.\n\n215\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.810\nIf you try to open a Microsoft Word file\nwith Notepad all you get is a bunch of\n\n216\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.430\nsquigglies.\n\n217\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.520\nIt's not like that at all,\nthis is plain text.\n\n218\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.370\nSo if I go to browse\nthrough my actual file and\n\n219\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.140\nhit enter here is what you get,\nHello world.\n\n220\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.040\n>> We have made a our first webpage.\n\n221\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.020\n>> Yeah we made our first webpage,\nit look real easy, but\n\n222\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.560\nin order to make a more\ncomplex webpage if you\n\n223\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.830\nlook at this right now there is no\nactual HTML going on here at all.\n\n224\n00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.980\nIf you wanna make a more complex webpage\n\n225\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.210\nwhat you have to do is\nstart using some HTML text.\n\n226\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.370\nSo I'm gonna write an incorrect webpage\nright now, just so that you see.\n\n227\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.880\nAnd we can define what HTML is.\n\n228\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.570\nSo I'm gonna put all this\ntext inside an h1 tag,\n\n229\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.060\nand you notice that Atom\nauto-completed it for me.\n\n230\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.750\nThat's one thing that's cool about Atom,\nthat you have all these add-ons.\n\n231\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.400\nAnd I installed an auto-completion add on.\n\n232\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.820\nAnd now when I go back to the page and\nI refresh, hey, look, the text is bigger.\n\n233\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.930\nJust by putting it inside those tags,\nthe text is bigger.\n\n234\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.030\nAnd there's a little bit of debate\nas to whether HTML is a programming\n\n235\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.746\nlanguage or not.\n\n236\n00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:16.970\nSome people, because you can't,\nyou don't have like if statements and\n\n237\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.650\nyou can't control the flow\nof your program and\n\n238\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.230\nthey think that it's not\na programming language.\n\n239\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.770\nBut there is such a thing as a declarative\nprogramming langauge that just says,\n\n240\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.160\nyou're basically telling\nthe computer what to do.\n\n241\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.320\nAnd I think that HTML\nfits that definition.\n\n242\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.870\nSo, like I said, there's a lot of debate.\n\n243\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.220\nI'm on the camp of HTML is\na programming language.\n\n244\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.650\nIt's a declarative programming language,\nand\n\n245\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:42.790\nright now we're gonna get into how to\nproperly, create an empty html document.\n\n246\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:49.524\nSo the first thing that you would wanna\ndo is the statement, DOCTYPE html.\n\n247\n00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:55.210\nAnd that's a unique statement that goes\nfrom the first line of the html line and\n\n248\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.900\nthe purpose of it is to\ndeclare is to tell the browser\n\n249\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.730\nwhich html specification\nare you gonna be using.\n\n250\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.620\nSo the first line of an html\nfile should be about, you should\n\n251\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.780\nbe telling the browser which html\nspecification you're going to be using and\n\n252\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.100\nthat's because when html first\ncame out it had a lot of, Options.\n\n253\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.020\nSo people were quick to use it,\nit was very simple.\n\n254\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.780\nIt was rather powerful\nin what it could do.\n\n255\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:27.610\nAnd obviously there was a lot of things\nthat you could do that go wrong in HTML.\n\n256\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd browsers try to correct that\nstuff automatically for you.\n\n257\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.300\nSo, but then they all started\ndoing it in different ways.\n\n258\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.390\nSo each browser had its own standard,\nand then that's when the W3C,\n\n259\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.640\nthe World Wide Web Consortium\ncame up with the HTML standard.\n\n260\n00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.970\nSo once they came up\nwith the HTML standard,\n\n261\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.150\nwe started having these DOCTYPE\ndeclarations at the top of the page so\n\n262\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:56.508\nthat the browser could use these standard\nHTML validators to validate your code.\n\n263\n00:13:56.508 --> 00:14:01.970\nSo before HTML5,\nwe had I believe it was XHTML,\n\n264\n00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.785\nand the doc type declaration for\nthat was a huge long mess.\n\n265\n00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:07.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And no point in remembering it now,\n\n266\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.440\nbecause now we're all moved to HTML 5,\n\n267\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.550\neven though HTML 5 is\nbackwards-compatible.\n\n268\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.100\nSo what we're doing, in effect, with our\nfirst line is saying, hey look, browser.\n\n269\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.570\nThis following web page\nis going to be HTML 5.\n\n270\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:27.360\nAnd after that we want our whole\ndocument to be enclosed in HTML tags.\n\n271\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.200\nHTML, the HTML tag should\nonly have two children.\n\n272\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.765\nSo what are children?\n\n273\n00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.830\nAny element that's inside\nanother element is a children.\n\n274\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:45.660\nSo the HTML tag is gonna have\ntwo children, head and body.\n\n275\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.590\nSo the head element is for\n\n276\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.780\nstuff that's not visible to the user,\nso you're defining behaviors.\n\n277\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.976\nSo I guess this page when it loads\non a mobile device it's zoom-able.\n\n278\n00:14:54.976 --> 00:14:56.250\nIt's scroll-able to the side.\n\n279\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.360\nIt's scroll-able up and down.\n\n280\n00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.340\nWhat's the initial load size and\n\n281\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.740\nadditional resources that might get\nloaded before the body of the page loads.\n\n282\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.580\nAnd for the body what you put in\nthe body is everything that's actually\n\n283\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.760\ngonna be visible.\n\n284\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.220\nSo all the stuff that makes a webpage,\nlike if we're at ITProTV.\n\n285\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.610\nEvery single HTML element\nthat you see here,\n\n286\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.990\nthat has a visual representation\ngoes inside the body.\n\n287\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:27.230\nSo The way that HTML tags work,\n\n288\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.480\nso let me create another tag here you must\nhave in order to have a properly formed.\n\n289\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.356\nHTML Document is the title.\n\n290\n00:15:35.356 --> 00:15:40.082\nI'm gonna say My First HTML Page.\n\n291\n00:15:40.082 --> 00:15:45.724\nAnd if you look at what the title\nis before this set index got HTML,\n\n292\n00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:50.767\nand now that I typed the title,\nit sets my first HTML page.\n\n293\n00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:52.797\nLet's look at what's going\non here a little bit.\n\n294\n00:15:52.797 --> 00:15:56.515\nYou have this HTML element that\nopens here and closes here.\n\n295\n00:15:56.515 --> 00:16:00.346\nAnd inside of it, you have a head\nelement and a body element.\n\n296\n00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:04.010\nInside the head element,\nyou have a title element.\n\n297\n00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.800\nSo, HTML elements nest inside\none another like that.\n\n298\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.940\nYou can never have a situation where the\ntitle element starts there, for example,\n\n299\n00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.760\nit started inside the head element.\n\n300\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.805\nAnd then it's gonna end\nafter the head element ends.\n\n301\n00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:19.266\nCuz then the title element's\nnot really inside of it.\n\n302\n00:16:19.266 --> 00:16:23.725\nSo that's why we talk about\nHTML as something that defines\n\n303\n00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:26.210\nthe structure of a website.\n\n304\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.340\nBecause you're really saying\nwhich elements are inside which.\n\n305\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.810\nAnd that's a bunch of repercussions\nthat we might get into to it later on,\n\n306\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.900\nas to how styles cascade down\nfrom one top element to another.\n\n307\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.500\nAnd as to how programming behaviors\nthat you code with JavaScript\n\n308\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.600\ncascade down from one element to another.\n\n309\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.460\n>> So when we're looking at this,\nwhat you've typed so far, like head or\n\n310\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.470\nlet's use title, title's inside the little\ngreater than less than symbols.\n\n311\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.600\nThat's a tag, and\nthat's the opening tag, and\n\n312\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.270\nthen the one with the slash title, that's\nthe closing tag, so that kind of finishes,\n\n313\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.560\ntells it hey, everything you're gonna find\nin the title is between those two tags.\n\n314\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.080\n>> Absolutely, that's 100% how it works.\n\n315\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.610\nFor the most part, in the vast\nmajority of HTML tags are like that.\n\n316\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.613\nYou have an opening one, that's in between\nthe what, they have a million names,\n\n317\n00:17:14.613 --> 00:17:17.598\nI call them angle brackets, so-\n>> Alligators or something.\n\n318\n00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:20.981\n>> Right, [LAUGH] alligators,\nchickenmouths, angle brackets,\n\n319\n00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:21.740\nany of those.\n\n320\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.480\nSo the title word that's inside angle\nbrackets, that's your opening tag, and\n\n321\n00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.630\nif it has a slash before\nthe name of the tag,\n\n322\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.650\nthen that's your closing tag,\nlike you said.\n\n323\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:36.975\nThere are a few elements that are called\nself-closing, that they don't have this.\n\n324\n00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:40.380\nWe're gonna get into how those work.\n\n325\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.537\nBut for now, what I wanna do is first of\nall, really get this concept through,\n\n326\n00:17:46.537 --> 00:17:51.687\nthat this is an HTML tag,\nthis is what I have selected right here.\n\n327\n00:17:51.687 --> 00:17:56.662\nAn HTML element is from the opening tag,\nalways content, and its closing tag and\n\n328\n00:17:56.662 --> 00:18:01.240\na child element is what,\nthe child element of head would be title.\n\n329\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.750\nSo if we go back to the preview of\nour website, let me save this, and\n\n330\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.120\nrefresh, here we go.\n\n331\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.940\nThis is actually not a well-formed\nHTML document because this stuff\n\n332\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.320\nis not inside anywhere, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.370\nSo when we have this HTML tag,\n\n334\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.820\neverything that is going to go in\nour website should be inside that.\n\n335\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.400\nAnd everything that's visible\nshould be inside the body type.\n\n336\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:33.818\nSo I'm gonna move this to put it up here,\nand now, it's a well-formed HTML element.\n\n337\n00:18:33.818 --> 00:18:36.360\nAnd you can tell that the browser\nkind of figures it out.\n\n338\n00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.260\nThe browser is pretty smart, and it fixes\nit for you, but you don't wanna run that\n\n339\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.630\nrisk of having different browsers\nfix things for you different ways.\n\n340\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.220\nSo you wanna comply with\nthe HTML5 standards.\n\n341\n00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.175\nAnd that's why we have what we have.\n\n342\n00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:53.090\nAnd it's funny because when I was looking\nat this, I went back to preview the page.\n\n343\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.900\nAnd that tag that was out there,\ndown here,\n\n344\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.330\nit was invisible to me because I'm so\nused to it, there can be nothing there.\n\n345\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.790\nSo I wasn't even looking at it.\n\n346\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.589\nSo, let's insert a couple\nmore HTML elements.\n\n347\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.602\nThere's h1, the purpose of that element\nis for a large heading, so it's like for\n\n348\n00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:13.440\na big title,\nis the largest title possible.\n\n349\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.880\nIt comes below this default\nstyling large font and so on.\n\n350\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.058\nThere's another element for\ntitles called h2,\n\n351\n00:19:21.058 --> 00:19:24.392\nso for Slightly Smaller Title.\n\n352\n00:19:24.392 --> 00:19:27.350\nAnd if we refresh the page,\nthen we have h2, Slightly Smaller Title.\n\n353\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.870\nAnd then there's elements all the way,\nh elements,\n\n354\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.440\nlike header elements, all the way to h6,\nwhich ironically, and for the most part,\n\n355\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:43.224\nis actually smaller than regular\nparagraphs, Very Small Title.\n\n356\n00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:48.152\nSo if we go look at the page now,\nwe have a tiny, tiny title.\n\n357\n00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:50.989\nSo let's look at a paragraph element.\n\n358\n00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.590\nSo a paragraph is another\nvery common element.\n\n359\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.909\nAnd if we just use a p tag,\nthat tells the browser so\n\n360\n00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:02.370\nthat the semantics of this element, this\ndata purpose of it is to be a paragraph.\n\n361\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.975\nSo in here, we can write some prose.\n\n362\n00:20:06.975 --> 00:20:10.840\nAnd I'm just gonna cut this and\n\n363\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.810\npaste this a bunch of times, not like\nthat, just wanna get the whole line.\n\n364\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.680\nPaste it four times like that,\nand let's see how that comes out.\n\n365\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.310\nOkay, is there anything that\nlooks curious to you about that?\n\n366\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.330\n>> It's very small, and\nit's all on one line.\n\n367\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.590\n>> Yeah, it's all on one line, right?\n\n368\n00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.360\nSo HTML actually does not care\nabout all the white space and\n\n369\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.390\nline breaks that you put.\n\n370\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.030\nSo once you have a space in between words,\nthat's as far as it will go.\n\n371\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.875\nLet's put all these line breaks here,\nfor example, and then look.\n\n372\n00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.885\nAnd still,\nwe have the same kind of structure.\n\n373\n00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:49.597\nAnd that's because the structure of HTML\nis defined only with these HTML elements,\n\n374\n00:20:49.597 --> 00:20:53.385\nand it lets you either type\nyour entire text in one line.\n\n375\n00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:57.629\nDepending on your preference, you may\nwanna have your paragraph in a large,\n\n376\n00:20:57.629 --> 00:21:02.320\nlarge line that even trails off the screen\nor that word wraps automatically.\n\n377\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.650\nOr you can just have, if you're teaching,\nif you're instructing,\n\n378\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.950\nyou wanna have your screen zoomed in.\n\n379\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.270\nAnd you can hit Enter, and\n\n380\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.770\nthat doesn't have any kind of\na visual representation on your page.\n\n381\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.700\nSo how we would add those line breaks\nis with one of those self-closing\n\n382\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.490\nelements that I alluded to earlier.\n\n383\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.240\nAnd it's called a line break element.\n\n384\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.120\nSo with br, this is a self-closing\nelement, and Atom closed it for\n\n385\n00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.655\nme automatically.\n\n386\n00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:28.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this element right here, as you see,\n\n387\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.650\nit has an opening tag only, and then\na slash near the closing chicken mouth.\n\n388\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:39.047\nSo it doesn't require this, so\nit doesn't require a closing element.\n\n389\n00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:40.870\nThe br is a self closing element.\n\n390\n00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.245\nSo if I grab some of these,\nand I paste them down here,\n\n391\n00:21:45.245 --> 00:21:48.178\nlook at what we're gonna have now.\n\n392\n00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:53.105\nSo we're gonna actually have\nthe line breaks that we expect.\n\n393\n00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:59.190\nSo this is still sometimes used, but\nyou don’t wanna abuse them too much.\n\n394\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.730\nLike if you want space between\nthese two headings, for\n\n395\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.392\nexample, you don’t wanna get\nin the habit of doing this,\n\n396\n00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:11.450\neven though that did effectively increase\nthe space, that’s harder to control.\n\n397\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:17.040\nWhen you’re modifying spacing and the way\nthe elements interact with one another,\n\n398\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.470\nyou really wanna do that with CSS, not\nnecessarily with a structure of the page.\n\n399\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.531\nSo, let's start-\n>> When you say harder to control,\n\n400\n00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:28.080\nlike interfere with other elements or\nthe way they're displayed on-\n\n401\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.322\n>> Well, for instance, so,\n\n402\n00:22:29.322 --> 00:22:30.610\nlet's bring that back.\n\n403\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.923\nLet's bring that element right here, and\n\n404\n00:22:32.923 --> 00:22:35.310\nyou see how much space\nit added right there?\n\n405\n00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.365\nThe amount of space that it adds right\nthere is depending on a property called\n\n406\n00:22:38.365 --> 00:22:39.350\nthe line height.\n\n407\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.220\nSo it's basically like hitting Enter\nonce and that's difficult to control.\n\n408\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.730\nWhat if you wanted a little\nbit less space than that?\n\n409\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.290\nWhat if you wanted more space than that?\n\n410\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:51.240\nWhat if you want less space than two brs,\nbut more space than one br?\n\n411\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.960\nSo now you're messing with\nthe line height of the brs, and\n\n412\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.390\nit actually becomes a lot more cumbersome\nto get the look that you want.\n\n413\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.100\nAnd it ends up looking worse\ncuz you end up having all\n\n414\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.650\nthese discrete units of space.\n\n415\n00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.310\nAnd when it comes to design, there's\na lot of subtlety that goes into it.\n\n416\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.930\nAnd you really wanna get things right\non the pixel, or on the percentage,\n\n417\n00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.960\nas the case may be.\n\n418\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.200\nYou don't wanna go with big,\n\n419\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.380\nbig measurements like that for\nspacing, like a line height.\n\n420\n00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.740\nSo okay, now that we have that,\nI wanna demo nesting of elements.\n\n421\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.680\nSo like,\nI wanna do some deep nesting of elements.\n\n422\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.618\nSo I'm gonna get rid of this and\n\n423\n00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:33.490\njust gonna copy this line\nover a couple more times.\n\n424\n00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.510\nAnd I wanna explain,\nI wanna show the fact that you can.\n\n425\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.258\nWe've seen it already, cuz right now,\nthe body is a parent element of h1,\n\n426\n00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:48.939\nh2, h6, and p, where you can have\narbitrarily deep levels of nesting.\n\n427\n00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:54.566\nSo, inside here,\nI can have another tag, strong, right?\n\n428\n00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:59.620\nAnd strong, what that does is it\nbolds text, and when we go look here,\n\n429\n00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:05.717\nThe we, I don't know if you can really see\nthat at home, but the we is actually bold.\n\n430\n00:24:05.717 --> 00:24:12.310\nAnd we can also, let me actually include\na little bit more text in this bolding.\n\n431\n00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.240\nWe can write some prose up to here.\n\n432\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.160\nAnd then inside the strong tag,\nyou can have italics and\n\n433\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.163\nhow you do italics is with this tag.\n\n434\n00:24:20.163 --> 00:24:22.100\nStands for emphasis.\n\n435\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.875\nAnd I'm gonna enclose that,\njust the word some in there.\n\n436\n00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:30.877\nSo if you look now,\nwe can write prose text as bold and\n\n437\n00:24:30.877 --> 00:24:35.314\nthe word some is italicized,\nso everything,\n\n438\n00:24:35.314 --> 00:24:40.980\nlook at how many things\nare applying to this word some.\n\n439\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.780\nSo everything that, all the stylings\nthat applies to paragraph elements\n\n440\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.110\nis applying to the word some, as well\nas all the styling for bold elements,\n\n441\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.080\nas well as all the styling for\nemphasis elements.\n\n442\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.035\nSo you see.\n\n443\n00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:54.754\n>> So it's actually cumulative.\n\n444\n00:24:54.754 --> 00:25:00.940\nThe italics or the emphasis there didn't\noverwrite the bold, it added to the bold.\n\n445\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.170\n>> Exactly and\nthat's what nesting is all about.\n\n446\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:08.572\nSo, you're creating elements that receive\nall the attributes of their parents and\n\n447\n00:25:08.572 --> 00:25:10.710\nget some new attributes as well.\n\n448\n00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.940\nAnd that's the main concept that\nI wanted to get across right now,\n\n449\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.870\nis that we have inside the HTML element,\nwe have the body element.\n\n450\n00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.880\nInside that we have this\nparagraph which has a child.\n\n451\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.470\nThat's the strong element.\n\n452\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.190\nAnd that one in turn has a child\nthat's an element, so there's what?\n\n453\n00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.190\nOne, two, three, four,\nfive levels of nesting here.\n\n454\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.830\nAnd you can take that arbitrarily deeper.\n\n455\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.670\nAnd we will be taking that arbitrarily\ndeeper when we get into some Bootstrap.\n\n456\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.880\n>> Is there any limit as to\nhow far I can nest down, or\n\n457\n00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.840\ndoes it start to bog down, or?\n\n458\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.010\n>> No,\nactually that's kinda what it's made for.\n\n459\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.440\nThat's kinda what HTML is made for,\nand you'll see some pages.\n\n460\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.370\nAnd that's why, indentation,\nif you'll notice, when I'm typing my code,\n\n461\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.740\nanything that's inside some other\nelement is indented with respect to it.\n\n462\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.500\nAnd that's why indentation is key.\n\n463\n00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.770\nYou're gonna have a really difficult time\n\n464\n00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.220\neven understanding your own code\nif you don't indent this way.\n\n465\n00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.850\nSo if an element like this h1 is\na child of the body and h6 and h2 and\n\n466\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.610\nh6 are children of the body as well,\n\n467\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.615\nthey have to be indented one level\nwith respect to where the body is.\n\n468\n00:26:14.615 --> 00:26:16.420\n>> To help you keep track\nof what the nesting is.\n\n469\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.256\nVery good.\n\n470\n00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:17.837\n>> Yeah.\n\n471\n00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:19.540\n>> All right, Victor, fantastic.\n\n472\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.410\nGreat look at, or\n\n473\n00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:25.305\nfirst looks anyway, at HTML and how\nthe structure of those HTML pages looks.\n\n474\n00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:28.835\nAnd got to see some of the way that\nthe browsers start interpreting that with\n\n475\n00:26:28.835 --> 00:26:32.035\nthe examining of the web pages, fantastic.\n\n476\n00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:36.409\nLook forward to more great content\nwith our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, so\n\n477\n00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:38.000\nwe thank you for that.\n\n478\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.830\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n479\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.550\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n480\n00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.650\n>> And I'm Victor Moreno.\n\n481\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.183\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n482\n00:26:45.183 --> 00:26:52.630\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:23.090\nI’m your host Mike Rodrick and today we\nare doing our HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.\n\n4\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.240\nIn this episode we are going\nto be covering CSS or\n\n5\n00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.380\nCascading Style Sheets and here to help us\nwith that of course is Mr. Victor Moreno.\n\n6\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.640\nHow are you doing Victor?\n\n7\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.560\n>> I'm doing great Mike,\nthanks for having me.\n\n8\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.970\nNow that you mentioned that CSS stands for\n\n9\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.440\nCascading Style Sheet you reminding\nme that in the last episode,\n\n10\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.900\nI never said what HTML actually stands\nfor, and it's a Hypertext Markup Language.\n\n11\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.029\nSo they call it, getting back to\nthe little kind of debate that I had with\n\n12\n00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:49.660\nmyself last episode,\nthey call it a markup language.\n\n13\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.460\nSo it is kind of a programming\nlanguage in that regard.\n\n14\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.320\nAnd before we dive into CSS,\nlet me just give our viewers\n\n15\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.250\na little bit more of an introduction,\nI'm gonna pick up where I left off.\n\n16\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.190\nIf you look on my screen, I'm gonna give\na little bit more of an introduction\n\n17\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.240\nof other HTML elements that we have.\n\n18\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.480\nSo besides all these headings,\nh1 through h6, and besides the paragraph,\n\n19\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.830\nthe strong and for emphasis,\nwhich italicizes again, we have lists.\n\n20\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070\nSo, lists are pretty useful,\nthey are used whenever you actually need\n\n21\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.150\na list of things like a bullet\npoint in list, or a number list, or\n\n22\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.890\nsometimes people use list even for things\nlike picture sliders and navigation bars.\n\n23\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.220\nSo let's get into how to create\n\n24\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520\nan unordered list that\nis a bullet point list.\n\n25\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.970\nIn order to do that you have\nto create this tag ul and\n\n26\n00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.260\nthen inside the ul each bullet\npoint is going to be a list item.\n\n27\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.570\nSo ul stands for\n\n28\n00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.220\nunordered list and each list element\ninside of it is gonna be a list item.\n\n29\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740\nSo that element is called li.\n\n30\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.848\nAnd then in here I can type,\nthis is a list item.\n\n31\n00:01:55.848 --> 00:02:03.470\nAnd another li, this is another list item.\n\n32\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.330\nAnd by the way if you notice at home\nthat if you try to follow along\n\n33\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.040\nwith this episode and you notice that my\ntags automatically close and yours don't.\n\n34\n00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.040\nThat's because I have\nan add-on that does that.\n\n35\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.720\nAnd if you want that to happen,\n\n36\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.518\nyou have to install an add-on\ncalled autoclose-html.\n\n37\n00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:24.330\nI don't want to go into too\nmuch of a tangent here,\n\n38\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.820\nbecause I want to go into HTML and CSS.\n\n39\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.740\nBut if you go into Files, Settings,\nyou have a Packages menu right there.\n\n40\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.085\nAnd you can install as many,\nmake a search and install packages.\n\n41\n00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:38.130\nThere's a bunch of useful\nthings that you can install.\n\n42\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.050\n>> Really great, as I said earlier,\nI use that atom.io not so much for\n\n43\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.674\nHTML but when I'm doing my show notes and\nthings, and there's add-ons for\n\n44\n00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:50.210\nSQL or TranX SQL that it can\ncolor code and put in there.\n\n45\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.300\nSo really fantastic editor and very easy,\nas you said, to expand its capabilities.\n\n46\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.440\nLots of cool packages you can install.\n\n47\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.460\n>> Absolutely Mike.\n\n48\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.620\nSo let's go take a look now at what this\nun-ordered list we created looks like.\n\n49\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.250\nSo, I'm gonna refresh here and here we go.\n\n50\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.330\n>> Nice\n>> We have two bullet points.\n\n51\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.380\nAnd it's real simple.\n\n52\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.640\nNow we're gonna create an ordered list.\n\n53\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.200\nSo ol is an ordered list and\ninternally is gonna be the same thing.\n\n54\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.710\nEach element inside of\nit is gonna be an li.\n\n55\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.690\nThis is item 1.\n\n56\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.890\nAnd then I'll create another one, li.\n\n57\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.410\nThis is item 2.\n\n58\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.130\nIf I save that and preview, there we go.\n\n59\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.180\nSo here's our unordered list,\nhere's our ordered list,\n\n60\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.535\nand now with that, we conclude.\n\n61\n00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:38.455\nYeah.\n\n62\n00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:41.475\n>> Yeah, that is really cool because you\ndidn't have to put the bullets in there,\n\n63\n00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:43.915\nyou didn't have to put the number one,\nthe number two in there.\n\n64\n00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:45.995\nFrom those tags it knew what to do.\n\n65\n00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:47.545\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n66\n00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:52.105\nAnd furthermore, once we get into CSS,\nwe're gonna see how we might be able to\n\n67\n00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:55.995\njust change all the bullet points to\nlook different for every li ever.\n\n68\n00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.370\nSo that's one thing that we're\ngonna be getting into in a minute.\n\n69\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.580\nBut one more thing I wanna cover\nabout lists is that they can nest.\n\n70\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.140\nSo inside this item 2,\nI can have a ul in here.\n\n71\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.030\nSo I have an ordered\nlist that has one item.\n\n72\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.630\nThen the second item itself underneath it,\nit has a ul, so an unordered list.\n\n73\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.620\nAnd then I can create another m line here.\n\n74\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.552\nThis is a sub-list and there we go.\n\n75\n00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:27.369\n[CROSSTALK] That will automatically\nfigure out that indentation for you.\n\n76\n00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:29.920\nIt will automatically change\nthe bullet style right there.\n\n77\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.590\nYou notice it's hollow.\n\n78\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.320\nAs opposed to a full, so that's one of\nthe nice little things about lists.\n\n79\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.840\nI'm gonna delete this because I want\nto get into a couple more elements and\n\n80\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.060\nI don't want to have too many\nthings going on on the page.\n\n81\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.710\nSo some other really important, arguably\n\n82\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.290\nthe most important elements that you're\ngonna have in HTML are your div and span,\n\n83\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.590\nand the reason why they're so important is\nthat they come with no default formatting.\n\n84\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.260\nSo if we look at this header.\n\n85\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.860\nIt's actually large text.\n\n86\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.050\nIt actually has additional space above it.\n\n87\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.320\nIt has a few things going on.\n\n88\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.900\nIt has space away from\nthe left of the screen.\n\n89\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.000\nIt has a bunch of things going on.\n\n90\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.370\nAnd with a div.\n\n91\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.130\nIf we create a div a div\nhas no default formatting.\n\n92\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.430\nSo inside the div I'm\ngoing to create some text.\n\n93\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.420\nThis is text with no default formatting.\n\n94\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.920\nPut a semicolon there.\n\n95\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.820\nSo it looks similar to the paragraph but\nin some browsers it'll look different.\n\n96\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.920\nIn some email clients\nit'll look different.\n\n97\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.840\nSome email clients have default\nstyling for paragraphs.\n\n98\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.230\nSome browsers also do as well.\n\n99\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.210\nSo a div is really like\na bare-bones element.\n\n100\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.580\n>> So it's really saying just ignore all\nof the other formatting that might be\n\n101\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.160\napplied to the page.\n\n102\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.750\nWithin this div tag it's gonna be\nneutral or like a clean slate.\n\n103\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.280\n>> Well, no.\n\n104\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.290\nActually, it still inherits from the top,\nso thanks for that clarification.\n\n105\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.400\nIt still inherits.\n\n106\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.710\nFrom whatever properties\nmight need to be inherited.\n\n107\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.890\nHowever it doesn't add properties\nof its own, like the h1.\n\n108\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.540\nSo the h1 will inherit properties but\nit adds some properties of its own and\n\n109\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.650\nmakes whatever's inside of it be large and\n\n110\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.170\nhave a little bit of space at the top,\nthese don't do that.\n\n111\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.590\nSo this adds no additional\ninherent styling of their own.\n\n112\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.240\nAnd there's another\nelement that does that.\n\n113\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.390\nSo actually before we get into\nthe other element that does that.\n\n114\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.370\nLet's look at how two divs\nbehave with one another.\n\n115\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.980\nDiv and here is the second div.\n\n116\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.210\nAnd so far if you notice, everything\nthat I've been adding to the page is\n\n117\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.170\nkinda stacking on top of one another.\n\n118\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.000\nSo you see this h1,\nit stacks on top of this and this h6.\n\n119\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.990\nEverything is stacking\non top of one another.\n\n120\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.080\nHere's my paragraph.\n\n121\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.190\nHere's one div and here's the second div.\n\n122\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.490\nThey're all stacking\non top of one another.\n\n123\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.840\nAnd that leads me to what,\n\n124\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.860\nthe first big CSS property we’re gonna\ndiscuss, which is the display style.\n\n125\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.930\nSo, every element I’m introducing to the\npage right now is called a block element.\n\n126\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.170\nWhat that means is that their display\nproperty is by default set to block, so\n\n127\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.940\nthey span the entire width of the page.\n\n128\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.600\nSo now we’re gonna get back\nunder the hood of the browser.\n\n129\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.270\nLike I showed you in the beginning\nwe're gonna inspect these things.\n\n130\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.090\nAnd we're gonna look at every element so.\n\n131\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.830\nWhen I'm also in my Hello World,\n\n132\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.760\ndo you notice how it's spanning\nthe entire width of the screen?\n\n133\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.370\n>> Yes, not just the word Hello World.\n\n134\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.930\n>> Exactly.\n>> It's the entire page.\n\n135\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.180\n>> It's the entire page.\n\n136\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.750\nAnd that's what the block element does.\n\n137\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.990\nIt spans the entire width of the page,\nthis one is also a block element,\n\n138\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.850\nthis is a block element,\nthis one's a block element but\n\n139\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.700\ncheck it out,\nstrong is not a block element.\n\n140\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.740\nSo strong does not span\nthe entire width of the page.\n\n141\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.360\nNeither does the right here.\n\n142\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.540\nSo italicizes some text.\n\n143\n00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.830\nIt does not span the entire\nwidth of the page.\n\n144\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.400\nSo that's what's called an inline element.\n\n145\n00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.391\nSo those are the two main types,\nthere's a few others.\n\n146\n00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:55.958\nBut the two main, main, main ones that\nyou want to learn right away from\n\n147\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.936\nthe beginning is the block display and\nthe inline display.\n\n148\n00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:03.528\nAnd so now that we've discussed\nthat we can talk about a span.\n\n149\n00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:07.103\nSo, a span is like the analogous of a div,\nso\n\n150\n00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:12.880\nan element that adds no additional\nformatting, but it's inline.\n\n151\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.690\nSpan, so we put a span right here,\naround the word div, not the tag div.\n\n152\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.220\nRight.\n\n153\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.320\nWhen we refresh the page, you're going to\nnotice that if I mouse over my second div,\n\n154\n00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.490\nthis one, here's a second div.\n\n155\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.440\nCheck it out.\nThe span pretty much did nothing, and\n\n156\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.150\nwhat would I use then?\n\n157\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.910\nWell, if I want to apply just a little\ncolor, or maybe a little background to\n\n158\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.980\nthe text shell,\nto just that one word inside a title.\n\n159\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.710\nWant to emphasize just one\nword with a custom style,\n\n160\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.420\nthat's when you would apply a span.\n\n161\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.940\nYou would surround that word with a span,\nand then apply the styles to that span.\n\n162\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:52.310\nSo we talked about all\nthese html elements.\n\n163\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.740\nWe talked about the display styles,\nblock and inline.\n\n164\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.960\nNow we're going to get into some CSS.\n\n165\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.820\nCSS how we add style to the page.\n\n166\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.010\nThere's a bunch of ways that you\ncan add style to an element.\n\n167\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.200\nI'm only gonna cover\nthe good one right now.\n\n168\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.756\nWhat do you think, should we give\nthe viewers a background on all of them or\n\n169\n00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:13.470\nshould we go to the.\n\n170\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.030\n>> Well, let's do it the right way first.\n\n171\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.110\n>> Okay.\n>> And then maybe you can mention\n\n172\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.940\nthe other ways.\n\n173\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.470\n>> Okay.\nSo, the right way.\n\n174\n00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.652\nAnd the point of CSS is to be\nable to have all your styles, for\n\n175\n00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:23.244\nyour website in one file, and\n\n176\n00:09:23.244 --> 00:09:27.650\nthen that file gets imported by all the\nother HTML files, that exist in that page.\n\n177\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.838\nSo that's what the whole point of CSS is,\nis that you have all your stuffs in one\n\n178\n00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:35.709\nplace, and if you need to change what\nyour title of your page looks like,\n\n179\n00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.161\nyou don't have to go into every HTML file,\nchange every title.\n\n180\n00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.610\nKinda like it is with Word documents,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.740\nThat with Word documents, if you wanna\nchange the formatting of your titles,\n\n182\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.437\nif you wanna change the indentation\nof your paragraphs.\n\n183\n00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:48.780\n>> Each one individually.\n\n184\n00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.590\n>> You'll suffer.\n\n185\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.452\nThere will be some suffering, and there\nwill be some thoughts of quitting, and\n\n186\n00:09:52.452 --> 00:09:54.002\nthere'll be some thoughts of going home.\n\n187\n00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:55.047\n[LAUGH] So, we don't,\n\n188\n00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:59.070\nwe're trying to get away from that when\nwe have the means to it with programming.\n\n189\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.300\nSo that's what CSS is for.\n\n190\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.010\nSo, let's link a CSS file to this file,\nand let's do it the right way first.\n\n191\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.910\nSo, I'm going to create this new CSS file,\nand\n\n192\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.952\nthe convention to call your main\nstyle sheet is usually Style.CSS,\n\n193\n00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:16.496\nso I created this file, it's empty right\nnow and before I add anything to it,\n\n194\n00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:20.923\nbefore any CSS styles that I write into\nthis file will not apply to my HTML,\n\n195\n00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:24.080\nbecause my HTML does not know\nof the existence of that file.\n\n196\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.480\nSo I have to link it.\n\n197\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.440\nSo how do I link it?\n\n198\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.540\nWith a link element inside the header.\n\n199\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.290\nSo inside my head element,\nI link other stat sheets and\n\n200\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.150\nI have to, I'm gonna write it like this.\n\n201\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.020\nI'm just gonna write it, and\n\n202\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.340\nthen I'm gonna explain a little\nbit of what's going on.\n\n203\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.337\nSo it's rel, which stands for\nrelationship, stylesheet, and\n\n204\n00:10:42.337 --> 00:10:47.720\nhref is style.css.\n\n205\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.563\nAnd this is also a self-closing element,\nas you see right here.\n\n206\n00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:52.541\nAnd what's going on here,\n\n207\n00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:56.760\nis this link element is linking\nthis file as a stylesheet.\n\n208\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.912\nSo by me writing this,\nI'm telling this html, hey,\n\n209\n00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:04.058\nlook you can go into this style as CSS\nfile and treat it as if it were CSS.\n\n210\n00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:07.303\nSo when you read that file,\neverything that you're gonna see is CSS,\n\n211\n00:11:07.303 --> 00:11:10.600\nand you're going to need to apply\nthose CSS rules to my current file.\n\n212\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.920\nSo if I save this, and I go to my preview,\nlet me close my developer tools.\n\n213\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.370\nGo to my preview, nothing changes, because\nI have not added any styles, right?\n\n214\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.700\nSo in order to actually add a style here,\nhere's the general format of CSS.\n\n215\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:33.550\nI have what's called a selector, so\na thing that tells HTML who is going to\n\n216\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.450\nget all these styles that are in between\nthe braces, so selector and braces.\n\n217\n00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.383\nInside the braces we don't have anything\nyet, we're gonna have some style rules.\n\n218\n00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:42.243\nSo there's a specific syntax for\nwhichever,\n\n219\n00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.486\nif you wanna change\nthe background color of something,\n\n220\n00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:47.653\nyou wanna change the color of the text,\nyou wanna give underline or whatever.\n\n221\n00:11:47.653 --> 00:11:52.580\nEach of those things has a specific\nsyntax, and those are called CSS rules.\n\n222\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.700\nCSS has two parts,\na selector that says HTML, to all H1\n\n223\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.890\non the page you are going to apply all the\nrules that are between these two braces.\n\n224\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.670\nSo now let's create a rule\nthat applies to all h1s.\n\n225\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.331\nLet's just say, really simple, color: red.\n\n226\n00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:13.970\nSo, this is the generic\nsyntax of a CSS rule.\n\n227\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.320\nYou have the rule name, then you have\na colon, and then you have the rule value.\n\n228\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.770\nSo now, what I'm doing with\nthe stylesheet is saying,\n\n229\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.820\ntelling whichever HTML file\nlinked to stachi that look, hey,\n\n230\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.300\nHTML, look through every H1 element and\nmake sure that the text color is red.\n\n231\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.670\nSo now, if we go back here,\nwe're gonna see what happens.\n\n232\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.380\nWe only have one H1 element, so\nthat's the only thing that became red.\n\n233\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.480\nBut let me just add another h1 element at\nthe very end for the sake of illustration.\n\n234\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.410\nThis is another h1.\n\n235\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.200\nRight?\n\n236\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.800\nAnd when we refresh this page.\n\n237\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.320\nWe're going to see that both are red.\n\n238\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.910\nSo that the style is applying\nto both of those elements.\n\n239\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.810\nThere are a ton of ways in which\nyou can apply CSS Selectors.\n\n240\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.863\nThe three most important ones,\n\n241\n00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:09.205\nthe three that I always like to\nteach first is number one, this one.\n\n242\n00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.925\nBecause when you're creating a look for\nyour corporate website or\n\n243\n00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:17.056\nto have you, you really want consistency.\n\n244\n00:13:17.056 --> 00:13:21.454\nSo a mistake a lot of beginners make is\nin, they have the main site title, right,\n\n245\n00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:24.301\nso they define a specific style for\nthat title only,\n\n246\n00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:27.740\nwhich we're going to get\ninto how to do in a second.\n\n247\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.156\nAnd then they have a subtitle and\nthen they find a specific style for\n\n248\n00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:33.901\nthat subtitle and\nthen they have another subtitle and\n\n249\n00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:37.866\nthey find a specific style for that\nsubtitle, and that gets very redundant,\n\n250\n00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:41.530\nand that's not efficient, so\nyou really want to style broadly first.\n\n251\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.620\nYou want to create broad style for all\nyour headings, all your paragraphs, all\n\n252\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.450\nspecific types of sections, so maybe if\nyou have a sidebar on you page, you wanna\n\n253\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.140\ncreate a style for all the elements in\nthere, you wanna go broad and then narrow.\n\n254\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.230\nSo, you don't wanna start narrow.\n\n255\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.720\nSo that's why I teach the selector first.\n\n256\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.980\nAnd then theres two other kinda ways that\nwe can apply style to specific elements.\n\n257\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.980\nWhat if we really want this title to be\n\n258\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.230\nmore important than the other\nh1’s that we have on the page.\n\n259\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.260\nWe can create what’s called a style class,\nand\n\n260\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.130\na style class has two components to it.\n\n261\n00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.430\nWe, first of all we have to declare here,\n\n262\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.910\nthe keyword class equals and\nthen some quotes, and\n\n263\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.170\nthen inside this class thing we're\ngonna put the name of the style class.\n\n264\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.980\nLet's just call it super main title.\n\n265\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.400\nOkay.\nSo that's our style class and\n\n266\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.570\nnow if we refresh the page nothings\nhappen, because that style class,\n\n267\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.200\neven though I told my h1 that it needed to\nget that style class the super main title,\n\n268\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.110\nI never defined here my CSS.\n\n269\n00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.254\nSo how do I define a style is very\nsimilar to what we did above,\n\n270\n00:14:53.254 --> 00:14:54.760\nexcept that it has to start with a dot.\n\n271\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.250\nSo, dot signals to CSS, that this rule,\nthat's going to be defined,\n\n272\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.930\npertains to a class, so, super-main-title.\n\n273\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:07.854\nAnd I'm going to have a I'll get\ninto what this is, later on,\n\n274\n00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:12.231\nbut just for the sake of actually no, I'm\ngoing to change the font size, font size.\n\n275\n00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:18.570\nI'm gonna make it ginormic 60px and\nlet's see how that looks.\n\n276\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.640\nSo it's super main, right?\n\n277\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.276\nAnd so let's recap how this works.\n\n278\n00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:24.829\nBy saying dot something\nas my CSS selector, so\n\n279\n00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:26.797\nthere's that terminology again.\n\n280\n00:15:26.797 --> 00:15:30.301\nThe selector is the one who\ngoes to the HTML page and\n\n281\n00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:34.750\nfigures out which elements\nneed to get this style, right?\n\n282\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.470\nSo if my CSS selector starts with\nthat dot, what I'm doing is say,\n\n283\n00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.670\nhey HTML, anytime you find something that\nhas the class equals super main title,\n\n284\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.030\nyou're gonna apply all these styles\nthat are in between these braces, and\n\n285\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.340\nthere can be multiple by the way.\n\n286\n00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.500\nSo let's see how that looks in action.\n\n287\n00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.238\nThis h1 says class\nequals super-main-title.\n\n288\n00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:59.733\nAnd that's why it gets\nthe font size 60 pixels.\n\n289\n00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:03.183\n>> So kinda like you were saying earlier,\nyou start with your general or your broad.\n\n290\n00:16:03.183 --> 00:16:08.849\nYou define what's going to be common\nbetween all h1s in that h1 selector.\n\n291\n00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:12.455\nBut then if you've got one or two h1s\nthat need to be slightly different,\n\n292\n00:16:12.455 --> 00:16:15.620\nyou can get a little more granular\nwith that class selector.\n\n293\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.890\n>> Absolutely, and that's precisely\nwhat the class selector is for.\n\n294\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.430\nI'll say that is one of the two\nthings that class elector is for\n\n295\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.620\nthe second one being, if you want\na style like a background color\n\n296\n00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.070\nthat is going to apply to a paragraph,\nas well as some divs or\n\n297\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.740\na background image,\nthen you can create a style.\n\n298\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.920\nSo it is nothing to do with the same\nbackground color to apply to some\n\n299\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.640\nbackgrounds, some headings, some ULs.\n\n300\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.320\nYou can use class and apply it to your UL,\nyour paragraph and whatever data.\n\n301\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.730\nWhatever other element,\nneeds to get that background color.\n\n302\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.835\nAnd, you know,\nyou don't have to do it by element.\n\n303\n00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:52.310\n>> That class is not\nspecifically tied to the H1.\n\n304\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.320\nWe're just using it in the H1,\nin this case.\n\n305\n00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.902\n>> Exactly.\n\n306\n00:16:54.902 --> 00:16:58.400\nAnd that leads us to\nthe discussion of this syntax.\n\n307\n00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.815\nSo this is some new syntax that we\nsee right here with this class equals\n\n308\n00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:07.590\nthing inside the setup chicken mouths for\nthe opening h1, right?\n\n309\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:14.580\nSo if you notice the class equals whatever\nthing, it's inside the opening HTML type.\n\n310\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.180\nAnd that's a new constant\nthat we need to describe and\n\n311\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.930\nintroduce, it's called an HTML attribute.\n\n312\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:26.080\nSo an attribute is basically a thing\nthat goes inside the opening tag.\n\n313\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.610\nIt modifies the behavior of the element.\n\n314\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.400\nSo that's what we did here with the class.\n\n315\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.130\nIt's modifying all the behavior\nof this element by making\n\n316\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.400\nsure that the super-main-title\nstyle gets applied to it.\n\n317\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.693\nAnd also, we saw another class\nright here with the rel stylesheet,\n\n318\n00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:44.630\nwhich defines how this link\nis going to be interpreted.\n\n319\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.960\nAnd the href where the file\nis going to be pulled from.\n\n320\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.870\nSo link in order to do anything\nrequires two attributes.\n\n321\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.160\nAnd now that we know about attributes,\n\n322\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.640\nwe can introduce some other HTML elements,\nwhich cannot work,\n\n323\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.060\ncannot do anything without attributes,\nand they're pretty important.\n\n324\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:08.310\nThe first one being the anchor tag, so\nthe anchor tag is how you create a link.\n\n325\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:14.000\nA link obviously has to components,\nnumber one, what's the text of the link?\n\n326\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.220\nWhat's the link going to say?\n\n327\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.360\nAnd number two,\nwhich website is going to send you to.\n\n328\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.350\nSo, the href attribute of an anchor tag\n\n329\n00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.350\nis the one that defines which\nwebsite you're going to go to.\n\n330\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.591\nSo I can type here http://www, and\n\n331\n00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:36.430\nyou do have to type the links all the way\nfrom http, at least in the beginning.\n\n332\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.150\nThere's a way that you can just do this.\n\n333\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.920\nBut I don't suggest you, if you're\nstarting out that you do that, Google.com\n\n334\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.680\nand inside here is my text, go to Google.\n\n335\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.870\nAnd if I reload my page now,\nhere’s my link I can click go to Google,\n\n336\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.100\nand if I click it,\nI actually go to Google, right?\n\n337\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:05.290\nOne thing to note is that the text,\nright here, doesn't really mean.\n\n338\n00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.890\nIt's up to you, to be honest,\nabout where that link is going.\n\n339\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.970\nSo you could kind of draw\npeople into going somewhere.\n\n340\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:15.325\n>> You could say, hey, click here to\ngo to Amazon.com, but if your href\n\n341\n00:19:15.325 --> 00:19:20.520\nattribute is www.google.com, that's where\nit's going, no matter what the text is.\n\n342\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.210\n>> Exactly.\n\n343\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.220\nSo you could write here, you know, to\nclick here to donate to UNICEF children,\n\n344\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.525\nand then send them to your own PayPal.\n\n345\n00:19:25.525 --> 00:19:27.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And actually more often that not just\n\n346\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.480\ngetting, don't do that.\n\n347\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.490\nDon't do that, never do that.\n\n348\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:36.866\nSo that's the href attribute of anchor\ntag, and the other element that\n\n349\n00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:42.020\nI kind of alluded to that we need\nactually to make this work is images.\n\n350\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:47.020\nSo image scr is the attribute for image,\n\n351\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:54.200\nand I'm actually just going to go\nto Google and look for something.\n\n352\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.550\nI'm going to look for,\nactually, you know what?\n\n353\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.750\nI'm just going to link an ITProTV image.\n\n354\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.240\nSo, let me see.\n\n355\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.268\nI was looking at the Python\nprogram in course.\n\n356\n00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:07.965\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this, which image can I get?\n\n357\n00:20:07.965 --> 00:20:09.665\nThis one's probably easy to get to.\n\n358\n00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:13.835\nSo I inspect the elements and\ncheck it out.\n\n359\n00:20:13.835 --> 00:20:15.915\nThat is an image element, it has a class.\n\n360\n00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.145\nWe already know what classes are.\n\n361\n00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:21.060\nSo this class has applied\nsome styling to make it,\n\n362\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.760\nbe side by side with the other images.\n\n363\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.590\nAnd here is the SRC.\n\n364\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.340\nSo here is where the image\nis loading from.\n\n365\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.070\nSo here we go.\n\n366\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:33.340\nSo if I actually just steal this\nlink from you guys, I can link it.\n\n367\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.368\nLet me just copy this,\nI can link it into my own page.\n\n368\n00:20:38.144 --> 00:20:40.710\nSo let me close my quotes,\nlet me make sure.\n\n369\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:46.090\nSo I have image, src equals, and then the\nvalue of, and all attributes are the same.\n\n370\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.160\nAlways, by the way, attribute name,\nequals, open quotes, and\n\n371\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.180\nthen the value of the attribute.\n\n372\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.500\nAnd that's what we have here.\n\n373\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.380\nSrc equals, open quotes the value\nof the attribute that link, right?\n\n374\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.580\nAnd then another thing that we need for\nimages is an alt attribute.\n\n375\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.860\nAnd the alt attribute is\na requirement by the HTML5 spec.\n\n376\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.140\nAnd it's something that helps\nif the image fails to load.\n\n377\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.950\nIt actually puts that text in there.\n\n378\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.910\nAnd it also helps the visually impaired\nwith their screen readers be able to see\n\n379\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.250\nhey, I don't, I can't see images,\n\n380\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.260\nbut give me a little description\nof what's going on here.\n\n381\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.870\nSo the alt attribute is\nwhat did we have here.\n\n382\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.512\nI broke that link, by the way, I think.\n\n383\n00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:25.707\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When I was copying it,\n\n384\n00:21:25.707 --> 00:21:26.870\nI must have broken it.\n\n385\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.870\nSo virtual lab server manager.\n\n386\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.700\nSo I can write that in the alt type.\n\n387\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.490\nVirtual lab server manager.\n\n388\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.540\nSo now I close my IMGs,\n\n389\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.090\nthe image elements and other self-closing\nelements, so when I close it, and\n\n390\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.820\nI go back to my preview right

those alt tags in there.\n\n406\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.940\nSo you'd go to web pages.\n\n407\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.350\nThey wouldn't have anything.\n\n408\n00:22:25.350 -->

00:22:55.910\nSo you are the one losing\nout if you don't do that.\n\n420\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.050\nLet me get back to CSS.\n\n421\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.360\nNow that we've discussed\nthe attributes and\n\n422\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.800\nthose two elements that require attributes\nto work, we can back to CSS and\n\n423\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:11.550\ntalk a little bit about additional\nways to apply styles to the page.\n\n424\n00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.610\nWe talked about how to style a single\nelement, we talked about how to style by\n\n425\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:21.051\na class name, now we need to talk\nabout how to style by an ID.\n\n426\n00:23:21.051 --> 00:23:26.409\nSo, right here, if I, just like\nwith the dot signaled this is going\n\n427\n00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:33.360\nto be a class name, a hashtag signals\nthat this is going to be an ID attribute.\n\n428\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.760\nI haven't given anything an ID attribute,\nbut I will in a second.\n\n429\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.880\nIt doesn't really matter the order\nin which you do these two things.\n\n430\n00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.540\nYou just have to have them both\nin order for the style to apply.\n\n431\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.870\nID, I'm going to say super cool paragraph.\n\n432\n00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.100\nAnd I'm just going to say color green.\n\n433\n00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.188\nSo I'm going to change the color\nof this paragraph down here.\n\n434\n00:23:56.188 --> 00:24:00.773\nAnd I'm going to, just because I\nincluded the word paragraph in the ID,\n\n435\n00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:04.547\ndoesn't mean that I have to\napply this only to paragraphs.\n\n436\n00:24:04.547 --> 00:24:10.631\nI could change this to super-cool-text,\nand then Apply the ID right here.\n\n437\n00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:15.000\nid= super-cool-text.\n\n438\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.070\nIf we go back and preview my page,\nnow that paragraph is coming out in green.\n\n439\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.650\n>> You can still see the emphasis and\nbold is strong in there, as well.\n\n440\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.822\n>> Exactly, very good point.\n\n441\n00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:29.250\nSo this applying a style with an ID,\nor with a class or what have you,\n\n442\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.840\nwill not necessarily, unless you\nexplicitly say that the font weight\n\n443\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.183\nof strong inside here is\nnot gonna be bold anymore,\n\n444\n00:24:37.183 --> 00:24:42.677\nis gonna be like the regular font weight,\nthen it's not gonna override anything.\n\n445\n00:24:42.677 --> 00:24:46.156\nThat's a thing that you basically have\nto get intuition for by using it and\n\n446\n00:24:46.156 --> 00:24:47.345\nusing it, and using it.\n\n447\n00:24:47.345 --> 00:24:48.785\nHow those styles are gonna interact,\n\n448\n00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:52.000\nhow they're gonna cascade down\nthrough the inheritance of elements.\n\n449\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.990\nBut do notice that,\nby applying that green style right there,\n\n450\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.880\nthe strong element is still, and\nthe m element are still green.\n\n451\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.420\nSo, they're inheriting that\ncolor from their parent element.\n\n452\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.954\n>> Is there a difference between doing\nthe class versus the id, obviously two\n\n453\n00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:09.336\ndifferent things that are advantage or\ndisadvantage to one of the other?\n\n454\n00:25:09.336 --> 00:25:11.514\n>> Okay, so very good question.\n\n455\n00:25:11.514 --> 00:25:17.532\nThe ID will only apply to the first\nelement that it finds with that ID.\n\n456\n00:25:17.532 --> 00:25:20.004\nSo IDs cannot be duplicated.\n\n457\n00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:23.111\nYou can't have multiple\nelements with the same ID.\n\n458\n00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:25.781\nI believe, but\ndon't 100% quote me on this,\n\n459\n00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:29.977\nI believe it's also a little bit faster\nfor the browser to find an element by its\n\n460\n00:25:29.977 --> 00:25:33.494\nID than it is to find all the elements\nthat have a specific clause.\n\n461\n00:25:33.494 --> 00:25:34.712\n>> Right.\n>> And that would make sense,\n\n462\n00:25:34.712 --> 00:25:38.040\nespecially if it's near the top, right, it\nfinds out first telling the one without ID\n\n463\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.140\nand it stops looking, where as with the\nclause, it has to look through the entire\n\n464\n00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.671\ndocument to see all the elements\nthat are gonna have that clause.\n\n465\n00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:44.626\n>> Okay.\n\n466\n00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:47.758\n>> So now let's talk about\nall the other not as good\n\n467\n00:25:47.758 --> 00:25:49.880\nwaste to insert CSS into a page.\n\n468\n00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.890\nAnother one that sometimes okay,\nespecially with\n\n469\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.760\nthe new modern techniques and\nthe advent of single page applications.\n\n470\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.780\nSo you have only one HTML page instead\nof having links to multiple HTML pages.\n\n471\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.570\nNowadays with a lot of JavaScript\nyou can have a single HTML page and\n\n472\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.610\nthen all your content there.\n\n473\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.530\nAnd when you click something,\n\n474\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.050\nit just deletes some content and\nloads some other content.\n\n475\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.010\nAnd that's the way some single page, and\n\n476\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.220\nthose those are called\nsingle page applications.\n\n477\n00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.380\nWith those, what you can do is you can\n\n478\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.370\ninclude your styles with the styles\nelement inside the header.\n\n479\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.570\nSo inside this style element\nthat can specify something,\n\n480\n00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.650\nthat say that I wanna style the body\nelements and give it a background color.\n\n481\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:38.600\nAnd I say body, and\nthen here background color, and\n\n482\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.120\nthis is a good moment, I guess, to talk\nabout how each of the colors work in HTML.\n\n483\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.810\nThere is a couple of ways of specifying\nthe colors, in general, in computing.\n\n484\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.560\nColors are made of red,\ngreen, and blue light.\n\n485\n00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.396\nSo we can specify colors in CSS\nthat way by just saying RGB.\n\n486\n00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:59.224\nI'm passing 3 numbers on here,\nranging from 0 to 255.\n\n487\n00:26:59.224 --> 00:27:05.908\nSo if you pass 0, 0, 0, you have complete\nabsence of red, green, or blue light.\n\n488\n00:27:05.908 --> 00:27:07.577\nWhat color do you think that will be like?\n\n489\n00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:08.476\n>> Black.\n\n490\n00:27:08.476 --> 00:27:09.280\n>> Exactly, black.\n\n491\n00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.573\nAbsence of light.\n\n492\n00:27:10.573 --> 00:27:11.255\nMakes sense, right?\n\n493\n00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:14.747\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n494\n00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:17.472\n>> And if you pass 255,255,255,\nit'll be white.\n\n495\n00:27:17.472 --> 00:27:18.746\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n496\n00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:22.787\n>> Any set of values that are all equal\nbetween red, green, and blue between 0 and\n\n497\n00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:24.552\n255 will be some shade of gray.\n\n498\n00:27:24.552 --> 00:27:30.320\nI'm going to do a real light gray,\n240, 240, and 240,\n\n499\n00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.922\nand then just to show you, no I don't\nknow that you can even see that at home.\n\n500\n00:27:36.922 --> 00:27:41.003\nLet me change that to 200, 200, 200.\n\n501\n00:27:41.003 --> 00:27:42.850\nAnd then reload the page right here.\n\n502\n00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.846\nThat's a little bit of\na darker shade of gray.\n\n503\n00:27:45.846 --> 00:27:49.460\nNow you can see our page is\nlooking wonderfully hideous.\n\n504\n00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.093\nAs an aside, that's why we use tools like\nBootstrap, because we don't want to have\n\n505\n00:27:54.093 --> 00:27:58.731\nto invest ten hours into tweaking and then\nchanging the color coordination little by\n\n506\n00:27:58.731 --> 00:28:01.888\nlittle in order for\nour page to even look half way decent.\n\n507\n00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:04.660\nWe wanna come with professionally\npicked layouts and fonts-\n\n508\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.333\n>> Right.\n\n509\n00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:06.341\n>> And font sizes all ready.\n\n510\n00:28:06.341 --> 00:28:10.002\n>> We don’t wanna go study up on color\ntheory and complimenting colors and\n\n511\n00:28:10.002 --> 00:28:10.681\nall of that.\n\n512\n00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:16.348\n>> Exactly, so just to recap, we've\ninserted a style sheet by linking a file,\n\n513\n00:28:16.348 --> 00:28:21.400\nwe inserted a style sheet by the use\nof the style tag, and the other way\n\n514\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:27.200\nin which you can insert styles,\nit's with what's called inline styles.\n\n515\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:33.340\nSo a given element, like this one for\nexample, can have a style attribute.\n\n516\n00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.889\nSo by adding an attribute to\nthis h1 that's called style=,\n\n517\n00:28:36.889 --> 00:28:40.522\nI can specify CSS rules right in there,\nin between the quotes.\n\n518\n00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:42.602\nSo I can say right here,\nlet me just change,\n\n519\n00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:44.409\nlet me see what color is it currently.\n\n520\n00:28:44.409 --> 00:28:46.270\nIt's red, let me change it to blue.\n\n521\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.176\nThat way we'll be really,\nreally all the way too hideous.\n\n522\n00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:53.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Color;blue:, and\n\n523\n00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:58.360\nthen when I load this,\nnow this thing is blue.\n\n524\n00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:04.020\nAnd one thing to note is that\nthese inline styles, they're how\n\n525\n00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.350\nyou use to originally control your styling\nfor your HTML before CSS was invented.\n\n526\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.040\nAnd that's pretty much why CSS happened.\n\n527\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.630\nImagine you have a gigantic page and you\nhave, you run a hotel reservation company.\n\n528\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.481\nAnd back in the day you\nwould have 158 HTML files.\n\n529\n00:29:20.481 --> 00:29:24.707\nI actually had a job like this you have\na 158 HTML files, 200 HTML files, and\n\n530\n00:29:24.707 --> 00:29:27.657\nnow all over a sudden you wanna\nchange your color palate.\n\n531\n00:29:27.657 --> 00:29:29.887\nYou wanna change just your\nlogo just your corporate logo,\n\n532\n00:29:29.887 --> 00:29:31.169\nyou wanna change it a little bit.\n\n533\n00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:36.058\nThen you have to go into every single\nfile one by one changing the logo.\n\n534\n00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:38.186\nYou wanna change your font or\nyour font size,\n\n535\n00:29:38.186 --> 00:29:40.991\nyou realize doesn't look good\nin your iPhone or whatever.\n\n536\n00:29:40.991 --> 00:29:44.783\nYou have to go into every single file,\nchanging the, every single file,\n\n537\n00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.142\nevery single paragraph.\n\n538\n00:29:46.142 --> 00:29:49.463\nChanging the style equals,\nfont size, whatever.\n\n539\n00:29:49.463 --> 00:29:51.505\nYou have to change, element by element.\n\n540\n00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:53.229\nWith the elements that you want to change.\n\n541\n00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:54.314\nAnd that's a nightmare.\n\n542\n00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:56.161\nThat could take forever.\n\n543\n00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.232\nAnd that's why we, or not we, but they-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:29:58.232 --> 00:30:01.021\n>> [LAUGH] That's why they invented CSS,\n\n545\n00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:06.946\nso that in one place, if I didn't have,\nif I'm not using the style attribute but\n\n546\n00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:11.565\nI'm just using these,\nin one place I can change, right here,\n\n547\n00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:18.392\nI can change the color of my H1s, all my\nH1s to be RGB, some dark grey, 50, 50, 50.\n\n548\n00:30:18.392 --> 00:30:21.847\n>> And if you had linked that\nstyle sheet to those 150 pages,\n\n549\n00:30:21.847 --> 00:30:25.597\nyou've changed it once, and\nit's changed on all 150 pages.\n\n550\n00:30:25.597 --> 00:30:26.526\n>> Absolutely.\n\n551\n00:30:26.526 --> 00:30:27.332\n>> Nice.\n\n552\n00:30:27.332 --> 00:30:31.970\n>> And that's the point of CSS styling.\n\n553\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.210\nSo to recap all the things that\nwe've talked about on this episode.\n\n554\n00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.660\nWe introduced some\nadditional HTML elements.\n\n555\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.358\nWe pretty much covered\nthe basics with HTML.\n\n556\n00:30:44.358 --> 00:30:48.169\nThe basics don't allow you, as you saw\nfrom my wonderful work right here,\n\n557\n00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:52.485\nwith just the basics, you cannot create\nany kind of professional looking website.\n\n558\n00:30:52.485 --> 00:30:57.049\nBut with an understanding of the basics,\nyou can start understand a framework\n\n559\n00:30:57.049 --> 00:31:01.281\nlike Bootstrap and you can start really\nputting all these ideas to work.\n\n560\n00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:06.081\nAnd, other than the basic elements,\nwe also covered the three most basic, most\n\n561\n00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:10.742\nimportant ways of creating CSS styles,\nwhich is styling by the element name,\n\n562\n00:31:10.742 --> 00:31:13.590\nstyling by the element ID and\nstyling by class.\n\n563\n00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:18.424\nWe also covered how to add the CSS styles.\n\n564\n00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:24.190\nWhether it be by a style sheet,\na style tag, or a style inline attribute.\n\n565\n00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.597\nHow to apply those\nstyles to HTML elements.\n\n566\n00:31:26.597 --> 00:31:29.152\n>> Fantastic we appreciate that Victor.\n\n567\n00:31:29.152 --> 00:31:34.277\nGreat look at CSS and how that worked and\nhow we can use it simplify our job\n\n568\n00:31:34.277 --> 00:31:39.163\nwhen we're trying to apply some\nformatting and style to that HTML.\n\n569\n00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:42.611\nWe appreciate that, even though the\ndocument wasn't the best looking maybe.\n\n570\n00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:46.397\nI thought it looked pretty good,\nbut my taste is questionable.\n\n571\n00:31:46.397 --> 00:31:48.118\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So anyway, we thank you for that.\n\n572\n00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:50.133\nWe hope

00:00:21.913\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,and today\nwe're doing our HTML CSS and Bootstrap.\n\n4\n00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:24.439\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at CSS.\n\n5\n00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.469\nNow this is a part two, so\nif you missed the previous episode,\n\n6\n00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.820\nmake sure you go back and\nwatch that one first.\n\n7\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.220\nAnd we'll continue on\nwith our thought process.\n\n8\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.580\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nVictor Moreno.\n\n9\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.860\nHow are you doing, Victor?\n\n10\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.519\n>> I'm doing great, Mike,\nthank you very much.\n\n11\n00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.842\nAs you said, we're gonna continue talking\na little bit about CSS right now.\n\n12\n00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.338\nWhat we did in the previous episode,\n\n13\n00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:48.430\nwe basically showed our viewers how\nto apply styles to HTML elements.\n\n14\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.355\nAnd we gave them, I don't know if you\nheard about that 80/20 principle,\n\n15\n00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:56.780\nwhere 80% of your results come from 20% of\nyour effort or 20% of your knowledge so\n\n16\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.580\nwe gave them that 20% in\nterms of how to apply CSS.\n\n17\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.000\nSo with what you learned last episode,\napplying styling by element type,\n\n18\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.720\nby class name and by id, you pretty\nmuch can apply styles to anything.\n\n19\n00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.370\nIt's just a matter of\ncreating new classes and\n\n20\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.750\napplying styles to whatever\nelement you wanna apply styles to.\n\n21\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.450\nWhat we're gonna talk about now, later on,\n\n22\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.190\nwe're gonna get into some more nuanced\nways to apply styles, but for now,\n\n23\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.930\nwe're gonna set that aside for a second,\nwe're gonna talk about actual style rules.\n\n24\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.900\nSo, what can you do with CSS?\n\n25\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.450\nWhat are the types of things that you\ncan control in your HTML elements?\n\n26\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.680\nAnd, we're also gonna talk about some CSS\nconcepts because in order to understand\n\n27\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.980\nthe rules, there's some nuanced things\nthat we have to understand about\n\n28\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.800\nhow CSS itself treats HTML elements.\n\n29\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.150\n>> Fantastic, I'm excited.\n\n30\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.530\n>> So, as I was saying,\n\n31\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.840\nyou can just add, basically,\njust to recap one last time,\n\n32\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.450\nif you wanna add a style to an HTML\nelement, you can just add an ID to it and\n\n33\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.170\nthen go into your CSS like we did\nright here and create an ID selector.\n\n34\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.380\nOr you can add a class to it.\n\n35\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.270\nAnd you can go into your CSS and\ncreate a class for it and\n\n36\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.830\nthen add your CSS rules right here,\nseparated by semicolons.\n\n37\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.790\nRight now what I want to do\nis take a little detour and\n\n38\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.000\nexplain one of those integral CSS\nconcepts called the CSS box model.\n\n39\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.568\nWhat that is is just the fancy name for\nhow your browser thinks of HTML elements.\n\n40\n00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:26.455\nYour browser things of HTML\nelements all as boxes, and\n\n41\n00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:30.809\nlet me demonstrate that right now with\nthe beautiful page that we're working on.\n\n42\n00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.485\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n43\n00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:37.260\nyou can pick that up if you mouse\nover all these elements, right?\n\n44\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.765\nYou see how they're all rectangles, right?\n\n45\n00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:40.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n46\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.260\nThat's because every HTML element you ever\ncreate, the browser thinks of it as a box.\n\n47\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.609\nIt has a border, and\nit has some space outside of it, and\n\n48\n00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.835\nit has some space between the border and\nthe content.\n\n49\n00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.738\nAnd let me show you\na visual representation,\n\n50\n00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:57.755\ncuz the browser actually provides\na really helpful way to visual that.\n\n51\n00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:02.803\nI'm gonna go scroll down to this\nparagraph element right here and\n\n52\n00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:07.131\nhere is our visual representation\nof the CSS box model.\n\n53\n00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:12.392\nSo when I mouse over this part,\nyou see that's my content,\n\n54\n00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.981\nthat's the content of my HTML element.\n\n55\n00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:17.920\nThen, here's the border.\n\n56\n00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.000\nSo if I wanted to specify a border,\nlet me go do that real quick so\n\n57\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.500\nwe can visualize this more easily.\n\n58\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340\nI'm gonna add a rule that all my\nparagraphs are gonna have a border,\n\n59\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.420\nso P and we'll get more into how this rule\n\n60\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860\nworks in a couple of minutes when we're\ntalking about the rules in particular.\n\n61\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.120\nBut just to be able to more\neasily visualize the box model,\n\n62\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.270\nI'm gonna have this rule, 2px solid black.\n\n63\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.790\nAnd let me go back, refresh my page.\n\n64\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.690\nNow you see that my\nparagraph has a border.\n\n65\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.459\nSo the border's no longer invisible.\n\n66\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.790\nLike I keep saying,\nevery HTML element is a box,\n\n67\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.110\nthey all have borders but by default in\nmost of them, the border's invisible.\n\n68\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.640\nI just made the border of this one visible\nso that we can visualize this margin and\n\n69\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.550\npadding stuff in the CSS box model stuff.\n\n70\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.374\n>> Yeah, also a good way to visualize how\nyou were saying earlier that it's a block\n\n71\n00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:14.331\nelement and it stretches even though the\ncontent only goes so far across the page.\n\n72\n00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:15.798\nThe element itself actually\ngoes from side to side.\n\n73\n00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:16.728\n>> Absolutely.\n\n74\n00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:17.529\n>> All the way across that page.\n\n75\n00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.228\n>> Absolutely.\n\n76\n00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:20.400\nSo that's another thing that\nwe see with this right here.\n\n77\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.810\nSo let's look at this content.\n\n78\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.195\nYeah, in the bottom right of my screen.\n\n79\n00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:26.791\nOkay.\n\n80\n00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:32.050\nSo let's look at this visual\nrepresentation of the box model.\n\n81\n00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.860\nAs I was saying, this is your content.\n\n82\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.930\nThen, here's my border.\n\n83\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.959\nIf I mouse over to this part,\nhere's my border and it says 2, 2, 2,\n\n84\n00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:42.100\n2, and that's because I specified that\nthe border would be two pixels all around.\n\n85\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.420\nAnd finally,\nwe get to the meat of the CSS box model.\n\n86\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.940\nThis concept, that's a little bit\nhard to explain, the padding.\n\n87\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.990\nThe padding is the space between\nthe border and the content of the element.\n\n88\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.550\nSo if I increase this padding,\nso basically let me say\n\n89\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.830\nI put 20 pixels of padding right here,\nlook what's going to happen.\n\n90\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.270\nIt's just going to increase\nthe size of the element and\n\n91\n00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.760\nincrease the empty area above\nthe content of that paragraph.\n\n92\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.360\nAnd then if I go and add 40 pixels of\npadding at the bottom, 40 pixels, then\n\n93\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.650\nI have twice as much space between the\ncontent of the paragraph and the border.\n\n94\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.100\nSo that's padding.\n\n95\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.090\nAnd you can add padding to the left and\nright of the element as well, so\n\n96\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.200\nif I add 60 pixels of padding right here,\nyou see that the content\n\n97\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.740\nof my paragraph is basically 60 pixels\nremoved from the left of the element.\n\n98\n00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:33.490\nSo padding is going to influence\n\n99\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.910\nhow far away the content of an HTML\nelement is from the border.\n\n100\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.370\nNow the other part of the CSS\nbox model is the margin.\n\n101\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.900\nThe margin basically influences how far\nthe element is from the previous, if it's\n\n102\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.850\nthe top margin and for instance how far\nthis element is from the previous element\n\n103\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.400\nand the bottom margin influences how far\nthis element is from the next element.\n\n104\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.680\nSo if you add bottom margin to an element,\n\n105\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.780\nit's gonna push whatever\nthe thing below is further down.\n\n106\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.810\nSo let's demonstrate that right now.\n\n107\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.920\nI have 16 pixels of margin bottom\nright now and you see right there\n\n108\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.060\nthat when I mouse over my margin,\nthe browser highlights it in orange, and\n\n109\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.000\nyou can actually see the 16\npixels of space right there.\n\n110\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.490\nAnd if that looks like it might\nbe too big for 16 pixels,\n\n111\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.900\nit's because I have my screen zoomed in.\n\n112\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.240\nSo if I change that to 50, now I have\nmore space between the current element,\n\n113\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.920\nwhose margin I just increased,\nand the next element.\n\n114\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.670\nSo this takes a lot of getting used to.\n\n115\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.020\nIt takes some time playing with this and\nreally trial and error and\n\n116\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.920\nexperimentation to understand it, and\nbasically with practice comes mastery.\n\n117\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.910\nBut what you really, really need to\nunderstand right now is that every element\n\n118\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.610\nis a box, even though for the most part,\nmost of them have an invisible border.\n\n119\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.543\nAnd then in order to control\nthe space in between elements,\n\n120\n00:06:54.543 --> 00:06:57.017\nyou can play with the padding and\nwith the margin.\n\n121\n00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:59.833\n>> And then, Victor, even if the border\nis not visible, the padding and\n\n122\n00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:01.619\nthe margining are still in effect, right?\n\n123\n00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:02.265\n>> Absolutely.\n\n124\n00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:03.481\n>> You can still add the padding.\n\n125\n00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:06.690\n>> Absolutely, you can still add\nthe padding, you can still add the margin.\n\n126\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.160\nIt'll just be space between\nan invisible border,\n\n127\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.690\nkind of like a zero-width border,\nand the content or\n\n128\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.346\na space between the zero-width border and\nthe next element, if it's a margin.\n\n129\n00:07:16.346 --> 00:07:18.316\n>> Very cool.\n\n130\n00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:23.600\n>> Okay, so just a quick aside to\nrecap on everything on that we've\n\n131\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.170\ndone from the very beginning, just to\ngive it some more perspective, HTML and\n\n132\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.390\nwebsites in general are just plain text.\n\n133\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.260\nYour browser receives this plain text,\n\n134\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.630\nHTML defines how your website\nis structured, CSS defines\n\n135\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.050\nthe specific customizations to\nthe look of each HTML element.\n\n136\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.210\nAnd now we're going to get\ninto specific CSS style rules.\n\n137\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:54.116\nWe've already covered one, so\none of these we already covered, but\n\n138\n00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:56.150\nI'm gonna cover it again.\n\n139\n00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.990\nIt's color, so\ncolor refers to the font color.\n\n140\n00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.928\nI'm gonna change the color\nof this paragraph.\n\n141\n00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:06.315\nThis green one right here.\n\n142\n00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:08.727\nAnd that was in the rule.\n\n143\n00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:13.949\nSuper-cool-text, so sometimes you have\nall these preset colors like green,\n\n144\n00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:17.090\nred, that you can use words to specify.\n\n145\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.120\nFor the most part, those are pretty ugly.\n\n146\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.656\nSo you rarely, rarely see those\nunless it's white or black.\n\n147\n00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:28.421\nSo I explained in the last episode how in\ncomputers colors are represented by red,\n\n148\n00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:32.493\ngreen and blue light, and\nmixtures of values of red, green and blue,\n\n149\n00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:33.615\nfrom 0 to 255.\n\n150\n00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:39.328\nSo let's go over that,\nhow you can specify that, again,\n\n151\n00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:45.210\nrgb and let's say that I want\nsome kind of red kind of tinge.\n\n152\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.790\nSo for red, I'm gonna use a high value,\nand then 0 for the others.\n\n153\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.760\nAnd let's see what comes out of that.\n\n154\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.570\nHere we go, some dark, not so bright red.\n\n155\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.740\nThere's another thing that you can\ndo to this way of specifying color.\n\n156\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.970\nYou can also specify an alpha value.\n\n157\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.560\nSo an alpha value stands for transparency\nand the way that you would do that is\n\n158\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.630\ninstead of specifying your rule by\nsaying rgb, you would say rgba.\n\n159\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.955\nAnd then you would need\none more value at the end.\n\n160\n00:09:12.955 --> 00:09:15.225\nSo the first value is for\nred, second value is for\n\n161\n00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:16.745\ngreen, third value is for blue.\n\n162\n00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:20.605\nAnd at the end, you specify a value for\nthe alpha, which is a transparency.\n\n163\n00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:23.255\nBut this value is no longer between 0 and\n255.\n\n164\n00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:26.726\nNow this time your value is\ngonna be between 0 and 1,\n\n165\n00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:29.092\nso a decimal between 0 and 1.\n\n166\n00:09:29.092 --> 00:09:33.761\nAnd where 0 is fully transparent,\nno visibility, 1 is fully opaque,\n\n167\n00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:38.900\nno transparency, and anywhere in\nthe middle, 0.7, is kinda see through.\n\n168\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.392\nSo I applied that and\nI don't know if you noticed it.\n\n169\n00:09:43.392 --> 00:09:47.270\nLet me change it to 0.3 and reload.\n\n170\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.500\nAnd now if you zoom in right there,\n\n171\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.333\nyou can see that's kinda\nsee through right there.\n\n172\n00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:53.672\nAnd if I were to change the background\ncolor then this shade of red would look\n\n173\n00:09:53.672 --> 00:09:57.912\na little bit different because it\nwould be influenced by the background.\n\n174\n00:09:57.912 --> 00:09:59.460\n>> Neat.\n\n175\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.180\n>> Now there's another way of\nspecifying colors that you\n\n176\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.140\ncome across quite often as well.\n\n177\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:10.190\nAnd it's not this rgb notation, it uses\nthe hexadecimal number representation.\n\n178\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.616\nSo in hexadecimal,\nI know just to give you a quick,\n\n179\n00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:16.902\nquick 30-second literacy on hexadecimals.\n\n180\n00:10:16.902 --> 00:10:22.560\nInstead of representing a number from 0\nto 9, you go from 0 all the way to F.\n\n181\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.512\nSo it would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 9, and then after 9 you have A, B,\n\n182\n00:10:27.512 --> 00:10:28.820\nC, D, E, F.\n\n183\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.131\nAnd that's basically a base-16\nform of representing numbers and\n\n184\n00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:35.508\nwith just two digits of hexadecimal,\n\n185\n00:10:35.508 --> 00:10:41.820\nyou can represent all the values that you\nwould represent with 0 to 255 in decimal.\n\n186\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.160\nSo, how does it look in HTML when we\nrepresent a color with hexadecimal?\n\n187\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.690\nYou have to start with a pound sign,\nor as the kids call it today, hashtag.\n\n188\n00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.115\nAnd then you have hexadecimal numbers,\n\n189\n00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:59.080\ntwo-digit hexadecimal numbers for\nred, green, and blue.\n\n190\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.243\nSo let's say that I want\nthis to be some dark blue.\n\n191\n00:11:02.243 --> 00:11:07.124\nI will go 0000 and for\nthen blue I might pick 99,\n\n192\n00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.955\nand let's see how this looks.\n\n193\n00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:12.710\nThere, so\nwe changed it to dark blue right now.\n\n194\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:17.030\nNow it can get pretty cumbersome to\nconvert from decimal to hexadecimal\n\n195\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.070\nif it's not what I'm doing right now,\nI'm just thinking, okay I want blue,\n\n196\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.980\nsome kind of dark blue.\n\n197\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.850\nSo I just give red 0, green 0, and\n\n198\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:30.100\nblue some value lower than the max, which\nis FF and I know it'll come out dark.\n\n199\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.220\nBut if you want to actually be able\nto pick colors, there's tools.\n\n200\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.028\nIf you go to your favorite search engine\nand you lookup the W3 Color Picker,\n\n201\n00:11:39.028 --> 00:11:44.771\nyou will find this particular tool and\nyou can click on any of these colors.\n\n202\n00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:48.983\nAnd it'll tell you right here\nhow to specify the color in RGB,\n\n203\n00:11:48.983 --> 00:11:53.033\nhow to specify it in the hexadecimal form,\nand even in the,\n\n204\n00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:56.550\nI think this is hue,\nsaturation, and lightness.\n\n205\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.670\nBut honestly,\nI don't think many people use that,\n\n206\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.690\nI certainly don't see it that much.\n\n207\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.970\nAnd one other thing that you could\ndo is you can use a more continuous\n\n208\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.195\nspectrum of colors by clicking right\nhere on Use HTML5 and here you go.\n\n209\n00:12:10.195 --> 00:12:14.630\nHere you have this really nice,\nreally neat color picker that you can use\n\n210\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.558\nto specify really,\nreally granular control over your color.\n\n211\n00:12:18.558 --> 00:12:22.180\n>> Hmm, very cool.\n\n212\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.610\n>> Okay, so that's a little\nbit of coverage on CSS color.\n\n213\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.630\nNow we're gonna talk about backgrounds.\n\n214\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.248\nSo what can we do to\nchange our backgrounds?\n\n215\n00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:37.781\nI've already shown you in this other style\nright here, this style tag right here,\n\n216\n00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:42.248\nI'm gonna delete this, by the way, how I\nchanged the background color of the body\n\n217\n00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:45.940\nelements and I changed\nthe background of the entire page.\n\n218\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.603\nI'm gonna add a new CSS selector here,\nfor body.\n\n219\n00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:52.741\nAnd I'm gonna skip the color and\ngo straight to how to,\n\n220\n00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:56.368\nthis is something that everybody\nloves to do in the beginning.\n\n221\n00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:59.518\nAnd I'm gonna show it for the sake of\ncompleteness, but it's something that you\n\n222\n00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:02.736\nshould probably stay away from the most\npart, how to specify a background image.\n\n223\n00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:06.462\n>> [LAUGH] Mention of the early\n90s web design right?\n\n224\n00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:09.740\n>> Right, yeah, so\nthat does not actually look good.\n\n225\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.484\nSo even though you'll be tempted,\nand I see a lot of beginning\n\n226\n00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:18.236\npeople who are beginning to get into HTML\nCSS, I see a lot of them that they wanna\n\n227\n00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:21.923\nput even GIF images and\nGIF animations as their background.\n\n228\n00:13:21.923 --> 00:13:27.537\nThat's a definite no,\nno from the stand point of design.\n\n229\n00:13:27.537 --> 00:13:31.493\nBut sometimes you might wanna have\ninstead of inserting an image element,\n\n230\n00:13:31.493 --> 00:13:35.385\nyou might wanna have one of those divs\nwith a specific background image for\n\n231\n00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:36.668\none reason or another.\n\n232\n00:13:36.668 --> 00:13:38.590\nMaybe you wanna give it\na rotation effect or\n\n233\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.305\nsomething like that, and\nthat's a valid way to do it.\n\n234\n00:13:41.305 --> 00:13:47.620\nSo in order to specify a background image,\nwe have an actual image, an image file.\n\n235\n00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.830\nThis would be the easiest way,\nthe most common way.\n\n236\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:55.310\nYou specify a url, and here in quotes,\nyou put a direct link to the image,\n\n237\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.080\nwhich I went on my favorite search\nengine and I found this one.\n\n238\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.340\nSo if we want this to be\nthe background image of our page,\n\n239\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.660\nwe would paste that in here and\nit's an absolute link to the image.\n\n240\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.470\nSo it basically tells the CSS style sheet\n\n241\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.990\nabsolutely everything it needs to\ndo in order to load this image.\n\n242\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.940\nIt needs to go to HTTP,\nit needs to find this domain,\n\n243\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.110\nthen inside there it needs to\ngo to the photos folder and so\n\n244\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.670\non until it finds the image and\nthat's called an absolute link.\n\n245\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.640\nWe're gonna talk about\nwhat a relative path and\n\n246\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.317\na relative link is in a moment but\nlet's just see the preview of,\n\n247\n00:14:35.317 --> 00:14:39.390\nlet's see,\n\n248\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.870\none second, sometimes things\ndon't load and it could be.\n\n249\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.670\nThere we go, it was just taking\na second cuz it's such a gigantic\n\n250\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.480\nimage that it just took a little while.\n\n251\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.320\nSo this is the current\nbackground image that I have.\n\n252\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.661\nI'm gonna-\n>> All you need now is a little bit of\n\n253\n00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:00.350\nMIDI music and we'd have us\na great website, right [LAUGH]?\n\n254\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.927\n>> Yeah, right, we'd have MySpace\npersonal website from the 90s.\n\n255\n00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:07.119\n>> Some trails behind the mouse,\nstuff like that, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:15:07.119 --> 00:15:12.840\n>> Absolutely, so I'm gonna change this\nback to the background color gray.\n\n257\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.869\nRgb and some kind of light gray.\n\n258\n00:15:19.869 --> 00:15:21.029\n>> And like you said, I mean,\n\n259\n00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:24.269\nthere are times when certain elements\nmight benefit from that background.\n\n260\n00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:26.891\nBut to do the whole page background,\nat least from what I've seen,\n\n261\n00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:29.191\nsometimes it makes it really hard to,\nthe rest of the page,\n\n262\n00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:32.140\nto actually read it because you've got\nchanging colors in the background.\n\n263\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.844\nSo it's really hard to pick the font\nthat's gonna stand out well against\n\n264\n00:15:34.844 --> 00:15:36.277\nthe change colors of the background.\n\n265\n00:15:36.277 --> 00:15:40.470\n>> Yeah absolutely, sometimes it's\nimpossible, it's not not necessary really\n\n266\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.725\nhard, sometimes it's impossible because\ndepending on your background image,\n\n267\n00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:48.446\nyou might have lighter areas of\nthe image and darker areas of the image.\n\n268\n00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:52.433\nAnd you would have to create a page with\nfonts that change color all the time in\n\n269\n00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:53.991\norder to be legible enough and\n\n270\n00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:57.190\nthat's definitely not something\nthat you really wanna do.\n\n271\n00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.903\nIt's gonna look way too busy in the end\nand one of the main things that you wanna\n\n272\n00:16:00.903 --> 00:16:04.692\naccomplish in web design is have a design\nthat's easy for the user to process.\n\n273\n00:16:04.692 --> 00:16:07.935\nThey call this cognitive friction,\nso I can understand what\n\n274\n00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:12.084\nyour page wants to say and how your page\nis organized without thinking at all.\n\n275\n00:16:12.084 --> 00:16:15.624\nAnd you achieve that through the use of\nwhite space, through the use of font,\n\n276\n00:16:15.624 --> 00:16:17.160\nand through the use of contrast.\n\n277\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.440\n>> One caveat to the image thing,\nsometimes if you have a really,\n\n278\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.110\nreally subtle texture, that can work.\n\n279\n00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:32.510\nSo I downloaded a texture image right here\nin order to demonstrate relative links.\n\n280\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.830\nI downloaded a texture image.\n\n281\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.750\nIt's background.jpg, right here.\n\n282\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.302\nIt's a subtle, marbly texture, and\n\n283\n00:16:38.302 --> 00:16:42.620\nI'm going to include that\nas my background image.\n\n284\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.040\n>> I don't know if it's gonna look good.\n\n285\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.270\nI've never used that particular image.\n\n286\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.990\nBut, I just want to\ndemonstrate the relative path.\n\n287\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.745\nAnd in order to include\nan image with a relative path,\n\n288\n00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:57.030\nI have to think about where this file,\nright here, where I'm currently located,\n\n289\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.530\nmy CSS file, where it is in\nrelationship to that image file.\n\n290\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.640\nThey're both located in\nthe same folder and for\n\n291\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.000\nthat reason,\nI don't need to specify any kind of path.\n\n292\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.340\nI can just type the name of the image\nbackground.jpg, and then that should load.\n\n293\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.070\nThere we go.\n\n294\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.830\nI don't know if you see\nthat little pattern there.\n\n295\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.210\n>> So, that's a relative file link.\n\n296\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.700\nUsually you want to create a folder\nstructure where you have all your\n\n297\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.910\nimage assets in a separate images or\nimg folder.\n\n298\n00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.340\nSo that's what I'm going to do.\n\n299\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.480\nNo let me delete that.\n\n300\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.100\nI created a file accidentally.\n\n301\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.041\nAnd what that's going to allow me to\ndo is to demonstrate how relative file\n\n302\n00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.350\nlinks work in a little bit more detail.\n\n303\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.780\nSo new folder, img.\n\n304\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.540\nI'm gonna move my\nbackground image in there.\n\n305\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.190\nSo now my background image\nis in my img folder.\n\n306\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.780\nAnd if I go back to my page and\n\n307\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.090\nload it I get white background\nbecause it failed to load that image.\n\n308\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.800\nSo how am I going to fix it?\n\n309\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.580\nSimply, I'm gonna tell my relative link,\nhey from this style sheet,\n\n310\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.325\nfrom the location of this style sheet,\nyou have to go into the img folder, and\n\n311\n00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:07.285\nthen once in there,\nyou find this background.jpg file.\n\n312\n00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:09.617\nAnd if I do it that way,\nit loads correctly.\n\n313\n00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:15.960\nSo again,\nwhen you're creating a relative link,\n\n314\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.940\nyou have to consider the location\nof the current file and\n\n315\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.880\nbasically how you would click around in\nyour windows or in your finder in Mac or\n\n316\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.730\nin your Windows Explorer how you would\nclick around to get to the new file.\n\n317\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:32.290\nSo if you have to go up a folder, then you\nwould have to, then you will put dot dot.\n\n318\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.810\nso in order to go up a folder you put dot\ndot and what do you have to click next?\n\n319\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.315\nAn images folder then you write images.\n\n320\n00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:43.200\n../images/whatever folder you need to keep\nclicking in order to access that file\n\n321\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.770\nyou would put that in succession.\n\n322\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.280\nDoes that make sense Mike?\n\n323\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.930\n>> It does.\nSo you're basically telling it how to find\n\n324\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.390\nthat image relative to where\nthat CSS style sheet is.\n\n325\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.410\nNow if, I'm thinking, Victor,\nsince these are relative,\n\n326\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.940\nif something moves,\nthat could break some things.\n\n327\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.025\nIf the CSS moved or if that image moved.\n\n328\n00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:03.215\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n329\n00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:08.890\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nwhen we're done with this little\n\n330\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.057\nintro project where we're just demoing\neach element, and we get really into using\n\n331\n00:19:13.057 --> 00:19:16.252\nBootstrap, we're going to create a\nstructure that's going to be maintainable.\n\n332\n00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:18.772\nSo right from the get go we're\ngonna have an HTML file,\n\n333\n00:19:18.772 --> 00:19:22.372\nthen we're gonna have a folder for our CSS\nstylesheets, we're gonna have a folder for\n\n334\n00:19:22.372 --> 00:19:24.772\nour images, a folder for\nour JavaScript, and\n\n335\n00:19:24.772 --> 00:19:27.832\nit's all gonna be the way it would\nbe in a production level website.\n\n336\n00:19:27.832 --> 00:19:28.342\n>> Fantastic.\n\n337\n00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:34.199\n>> Okay so we talked about some CSS rules,\nwe've talked about how to specify color.\n\n338\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.070\nBackground images, absolutely relative\npass, we talked about the color picker.\n\n339\n00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.610\nSo now let's talk a little bit about the\ndifferent units of measurements that you\n\n340\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.110\nhave, the most common units of measurement\nthat you have available in CSS.\n\n341\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.030\nAny time that you wanna specify\nthe size of something, like for\n\n342\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.660\nexample with this border\nI specified two pixels.\n\n343\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.710\nLet me go back to my,\nya here in the super main title,\n\n344\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.710\nwhich was the way that I\nscaled this H1 to be larger.\n\n345\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.460\nI specified a font size and I said 60px.\n\n346\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.490\nSo that's in pixels.\n\n347\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.830\nThat's one unit of measurement of CSS,\npixels.\n\n348\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.520\nAnd as you might expect,\nit's just all about your device pixels.\n\n349\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.620\nThere's another unit of\nmeasurement that's called the.\n\n350\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.026\nSo if I put font size,\nlet me put for example 5em\n\n351\n00:20:24.026 --> 00:20:29.425\nhere there's going to be some other\nkind of measurement, and it depends.\n\n352\n00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:31.955\nIt's like a cloudy,\na little bit of a shaky constant.\n\n353\n00:20:31.955 --> 00:20:35.940\nIt depends on what\nthe browser's line height is.\n\n354\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.760\nSo what the browser thinks\nthe default font is for\n\n355\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.730\nthat particular browser, that is what\nan one is going to be considered.\n\n356\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.640\nAnd that is helpful, why?\n\n357\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.620\nBecause sometimes, especially with modern\nsmart phones, you'll have somebody with\n\n358\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.745\na five inch screen that has a trillion,\nbagillion pixels.\n\n359\n00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:53.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n360\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.150\nAnd you don't wanna specify font\nsizes in pixels, necessarily.\n\n361\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.850\nYou wanna just listen to what that browser\nthinks should be the height of a line and\n\n362\n00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.520\nthen specify font sizes\nin terms of that height.\n\n363\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:10.260\nOne pitfall of em's,\nlet me demonstrate, em's trickle down.\n\n364\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:16.926\nSo if I specify the body to have\na specific font size, font size,\n\n365\n00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:22.660\nI'm gonna put 5em Then when I refresh,\nthis is.\n\n366\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.410\n>> Wow [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.290\n>> You see?\n\n368\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.680\nSo, because my body receive\nthe font size of 5em, and\n\n369\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.370\nthen that particular each one also\nreceived the font size of 5em,\n\n370\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.500\nmy body said, hey look, any line height,\nany text that you have,\n\n371\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.090\nconsider the line height to be five\ntimes of what it would normally be.\n\n372\n00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.000\nAnd then this h1 comes in and says, hey,\n\n373\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.310\nconsider the size of this particular h1\nto be five times of whatever that is.\n\n374\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.270\nSo they're multiplies.\n\n375\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:53.866\nSo now I have an h1 with 25ems, and\nthat's a little tricky to deal with.\n\n376\n00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:58.509\nAnd even though it makes a lot of sense\nto use a measurement that's relative like\n\n377\n00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:04.423\nthis for responsive design It\nbecomes cumbersome cuz then you're\n\n378\n00:22:04.423 --> 00:22:09.040\nplaying with 1.7em and 1.9em, and all\nthis stuff like that, that's difficult.\n\n379\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.430\nAnd it takes a lot of trial and error.\n\n380\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.440\nSo that's where REMs come in.\n\n381\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.510\nSo there's a different unit\nof measurement called REM.\n\n382\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:23.972\nSo if I put rem here and I put rem here,\nand I just use rems everywhere,\n\n383\n00:22:23.972 --> 00:22:30.039\nrems behave the same as ems,\nbut they don't multiply.\n\n384\n00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:34.301\nSo you see, I specifed my body's\nfont size to be 5rem, and\n\n385\n00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:39.520\nthen this guy went back to being the way\nit was before I specifed the body.\n\n386\n00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.219\nSo let me show you how that works,\nI'm going to delete the style rule.\n\n387\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.050\nWe load here, and you see,\n\n388\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.510\nthat's exactly the same size,\nbecause the rems don't multiply.\n\n389\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:53.750\nHowever, notice what's going on down\nhere with the rest of the elements.\n\n390\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.700\nThis one is even larger than this one now.\n\n391\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.720\nAnd, why is that?\n\n392\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.400\nBecause h1s through h6s,\n\n393\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.260\nthe default styling that they\ncome with is specified in ems.\n\n394\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.100\nSo even though I specified rem at the top,\nthe of the h2 and h6 and\n\n395\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.380\nso on is going to be\nmultiplied times that rem.\n\n396\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.310\nSo-\n>> Tricky.\n\n397\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.350\n>> Yeah, it is pretty tricky.\n\n398\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.315\nIt is pretty tricky.\n\n399\n00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:19.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you know what, for that reason, for\n\n400\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.650\nthis trickery, how much stuff is\nbuilt into all these elements.\n\n401\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.810\nA lot of designers choose to just\ncreate what's called a reset style.\n\n402\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.170\nSo they'll go in there and the top of\ntheir style sheet they're just gonna say\n\n403\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:39.040\nbody, and they're going to have a bunch\nof CSS selectors to reset everything.\n\n404\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.810\nTo put the padding of everything to zero,\nthe margin of everything to zero,\n\n405\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.020\nthe font size of everything to 1rem\n>> The line height of everything to\n\n406\n00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.710\na specific amount of pixels and\njust reset everything and\n\n407\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.570\nget rid of all those default behaviors.\n\n408\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.361\nEven though it's going to of\nconsume a little more time upfront,\n\n409\n00:23:55.361 --> 00:24:01.476\nredoing the larger sizing for h1s, and\nslightly smaller sizing for h2 and so on.\n\n410\n00:24:01.476 --> 00:24:05.172\nIn the long run, they're gonna win out\nbecause they're not gonna have to be\n\n411\n00:24:05.172 --> 00:24:08.776\ndealing with those nightmares of why\nis this bigger than I expect it to be?\n\n412\n00:24:08.776 --> 00:24:09.865\n>> That's clever.\n\n413\n00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:14.012\nCuz now, you know you're starting\npoint And you can work from there.\n\n414\n00:24:14.012 --> 00:24:15.463\n>> Absolutely.\n\n415\n00:24:15.463 --> 00:24:18.502\nSo another property that\nI wanted to cover, well,\n\n416\n00:24:18.502 --> 00:24:22.430\nlet me take off this,\ncuz that page is way too large right now.\n\n417\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:27.089\nAnother property that I wanted to cover\nis specify width and height of elements.\n\n418\n00:24:27.089 --> 00:24:31.426\nI'm gonna take this paragraph and\nI'm going to give it a specific width, and\n\n419\n00:24:31.426 --> 00:24:36.150\nthat will take me to the next also\nvery important unit of measurement.\n\n420\n00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:42.782\nSo for this paragraph, I'm going\nto say that it has a width of 50%.\n\n421\n00:24:45.905 --> 00:24:49.086\nAnd you see,\nit's 50% of the containing elements and\n\n422\n00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:51.520\nthat's how the percentages work.\n\n423\n00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.410\nSo percentages are also very good to\nuse because they're going to adjust to\n\n424\n00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.670\nthe specific width of every device.\n\n425\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.180\nBut notice that even\nthough I set width 50%,\n\n426\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.030\nwhat did that actually accomplish\nin terms of my layout?\n\n427\n00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.050\nYou see.\nIt's still a block element.\n\n428\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.980\nIt still spans the entire\nwidth of the screen.\n\n429\n00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:17.130\nAll it did is make the content smaller,\nand make up for that with margin.\n\n430\n00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.980\n>> So it added some of the margin over\nthere on the right to push everything 50%\n\n431\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.800\nback to the left.\n\n432\n00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.500\n>> Absolutely.\n\n433\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.680\n>> That's exactly what it did.\n\n434\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.040\nSo it just makes the content the size that\nit wants it to be, and compensates for\n\n435\n00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.780\nthe rest with margin.\n\n436\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.650\nSo it's a little bit tricky.\n\n437\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000\nAnd it makes it so that we need to\ntalk about the other display styles.\n\n438\n00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.030\nWe mentioned display inline and\ndisplay block.\n\n439\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.210\nLets see what this would behave like.\n\n440\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.040\nI should am gonna clear\nsome of these elements so\n\n441\n00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.450\nthat we're not confounded by\nthe interaction between different things.\n\n442\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.600\nI'm gonna get rid of all this stuff.\n\n443\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.140\nAnd we're gonna have the paragraph\nright here and the div.\n\n444\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.250\nThey're both block elements.\n\n445\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.280\nThat's why they're both\nstacking on top of one another.\n\n446\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.640\nGo ahead and\nset them both to be inline elements.\n\n447\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.732\nWe're gonna see what happens.\n\n448\n00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:13.565\nWell, actually, I'm gonna give\na style class to both of them.\n\n449\n00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:17.771\ndiv, class, d-inline and\n\n450\n00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:25.840\nI'm gonna give the same style\nclass to the paragraph.\n\n451\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.720\nThe inline right here and then I'm\ngonna actually create the stock loss.\n\n452\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.360\nSo how do I create a stock loss again?\n\n453\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.512\nI have to say dot and\nthen the name of the class,\n\n454\n00:26:40.512 --> 00:26:45.676\nso in here, I'm gonna say display: inline.\n\n455\n00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:48.360\nLook what's gonna happen now though.\n\n456\n00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.340\nSo now I kinda went too far.\n\n457\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.250\nThey're displaying next to one another.\n\n458\n00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.950\nBut check it out, there's no kinda margin\nand in particular this div right here,\n\n459\n00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.000\nit's size is as small\nas it can possibly be.\n\n460\n00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.219\nSo you see I'm not having like a,\n\n461\n00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:08.199\nalso my 50% width rule right\nhere is being overwritten.\n\n462\n00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:09.447\nI don't know if you could notice that, but\n\n463\n00:27:09.447 --> 00:27:11.570\nit's actually going more\nthan 50% of the screen.\n\n464\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:16.500\nAnd this, what inline does basically,\nis things don't stack anymore, and\n\n465\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.060\nthe size of the box around the element is\nequally at exactly what it needs to be.\n\n466\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.740\nThe minimum that it needs to\nbe to fit those contents.\n\n467\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:29.850\nSo this is how things worked for\na long time, and people got around,\n\n468\n00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.900\nand they created multiple column\nlayouts by using this complex and\n\n469\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.570\nkind of annoying and difficult to\nunderstand concept called floats.\n\n470\n00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.310\nSo they had everything displayed in blacks\nand they specified their width either in\n\n471\n00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:47.540\npixels or in percentages, and then they\nadded a rule that said float left so\n\n472\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.950\nthat their block elements would stay\nthe size that they were and they would\n\n473\n00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.490\nfloat next to each other like words in\na sentence kinda like words in a sentence.\n\n474\n00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.930\nThat is a little bit outdated because once\nyou out of float to one element it kinda\n\n475\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.170\ntrickles down to elements that are not\nnecessarily inside of it but after it, and\n\n476\n00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.300\nthat is difficult to manage.\n\n477\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:09.025\nSo what they created was a display\nstyle is called inline-block.\n\n478\n00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.640\nAnd we have that.\n\n479\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:17.254\nOur paragraph recovered\nits original 50% width,\n\n480\n00:28:17.254 --> 00:28:21.619\nand the div that's after it still has only\n\n481\n00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:27.180\nthe sizing that's necessary\nto fit the content.\n\n482\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.811\nBut I can actually go and\nspecify that I want a width of 50%.\n\n483\n00:28:36.043 --> 00:28:40.779\nAnd if you haven't done this before you\nmight think that they would line up next\n\n484\n00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:42.250\nto one another.\n\n485\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.065\nBut man, what happened now?\n\n486\n00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:47.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the problem here is that that 50%\n\n487\n00:28:47.574 --> 00:28:52.415\ndoesn't actually account for\nthe sizing of that border.\n\n488\n00:28:52.415 --> 00:28:55.870\nAnd actually inline block elements also,\nso that's one of the pitfalls.\n\n489\n00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.780\nFirst of all,\nthe default sizing of an element.\n\n490\n00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.170\nWhatever percentage is specified\ndoes not account for the border.\n\n491\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.810\nYou could fix that by saying\nthis box sizing border-box,\n\n492\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:12.610\nbut when it comes to inline block\nelements, they have like this little bit\n\n493\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.070\nof annoying space between them and there's\njust nothing that you can do about it.\n\n494\n00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.662\nSo you have to compensate\nthat with a percentage here.\n\n495\n00:29:18.662 --> 00:29:23.951\nSo let's say 48.5%.\n\n496\n00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:28.020\nAnd now, my paragraph looks like\nit's roughly half the screen.\n\n497\n00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.250\nMy div looks like it's\nroughly half the screen.\n\n498\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.310\nActually I miss it.\n\n499\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.410\nI miss the mark by little bit.\n\n500\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.529\nI should probably-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Still here.\n\n501\n00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:35.410\n>> I should probably go up to like 49.\n\n502\n00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.590\nBut you get the idea.\n\n503\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.150\nYou have to tweak that little by little.\n\n504\n00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.919\n>> I remember the horror, there was one\npoint early on in my career, decade ago,\n\n505\n00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:44.945\nwhat I thought about doing is\na web design and things like that,\n\n506\n00:29:44.945 --> 00:29:47.761\nit turns out that I'm not\ncreative enough for any of this.\n\n507\n00:29:47.761 --> 00:29:51.305\nBut I do remember fighting with that and\ntrying to get elements lined up and\n\n508\n00:29:51.305 --> 00:29:53.077\ntrying to play with those numbers and\n\n509\n00:29:53.077 --> 00:29:55.605\nnot understanding why I was having so\nmuch trouble.\n\n510\n00:29:55.605 --> 00:29:57.600\nIt makes all of the sense\nin the world now.\n\n511\n00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.400\n>> Yeah.\nSo there's a lot of stuff that,\n\n512\n00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.380\nbecause HTML is so old, and it's evolved\nso much, and it's had sort of so\n\n513\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.520\nmany little add-ons tacked on top of it,\nlittle by little.\n\n514\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.596\nAnd the same thing with CSS.\n\n515\n00:30:10.596 --> 00:30:13.390\nThere's all these little nuances\nthat kinda don't really make sense.\n\n516\n00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.090\nAnd you just have to learn by experience.\n\n517\n00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:19.550\nAnd luckily, in this day and age we have\nplaces like stack overflow and they'll\n\n518\n00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.180\nbe three schools that can kinda have even\nsometimes they even have a warning sign\n\n519\n00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.849\ntelling you, hey, this is a common\npitfall for this type of styling rule.\n\n520\n00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.939\nSo there's another display type that I\nwanted to cover which is display none and\n\n521\n00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:41.260\nwhat that does, as you might imagine,\nis not display at all.\n\n522\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.820\nSo if i said my d inline class,\n\n523\n00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.600\nwhich by the way this recap is being\napplied to the paragraph and the div.\n\n524\n00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.796\nIf I set that class to display none,\ncheck out what's going to happen.\n\n525\n00:30:53.796 --> 00:30:55.707\nIt's not gonna display.\n\n526\n00:30:55.707 --> 00:30:56.878\nThat one's straightforward at least.\n\n527\n00:30:56.878 --> 00:30:57.862\n>> Right.\n\n528\n00:30:57.862 --> 00:31:01.510\nWhere would I wanna use that?\n\n529\n00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.083\nWhy would I wanna block to not display?\n\n530\n00:31:04.083 --> 00:31:04.962\n>> That's an awesome question.\n\n531\n00:31:04.962 --> 00:31:06.013\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank you for asking that question.\n\n532\n00:31:06.013 --> 00:31:09.710\nSo the main reason why you would want\nthat in the context of those single\n\n533\n00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.846\npage applications that I was mentioning,\na lot of times you have the markup for\n\n534\n00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:16.165\na specific section of the page,\nthe HTML for\n\n535\n00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:20.009\nthe specific section of the page it loads,\nand it just has display none.\n\n536\n00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:23.396\nWhen you click on some button,\nwhatever is showing gets display none and\n\n537\n00:31:23.396 --> 00:31:26.283\nthe thing that was previously\nhidden gets display block, and\n\n538\n00:31:26.283 --> 00:31:29.190\nthen that's one way to make\nthose single page applications.\n\n539\n00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.748\n>> So we can programmatically switch\nthe display from none to what have you.\n\n540\n00:31:32.748 --> 00:31:36.230\n>> Absolutely, with JavaSacript you can\nprogrammatically switch any CSS property,\n\n541\n00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.530\nyou can pretty much do anything\nyou want to the html structure.\n\n542\n00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.736\n>> Very cool.\n\n543\n00:31:41.736 --> 00:31:46.738\n>> Okay, so one more thing that I wanna\nget into as a last kind of like CSS rule\n\n544\n00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:52.150\nis the fact that there's this little sort\nof, because CSS so many things are so\n\n545\n00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.414\ndifficult to understand and\nit's evolved so much over time,\n\n546\n00:31:56.414 --> 00:32:00.768\nthere are some things that I sort\nof treat like little recipes.\n\n547\n00:32:00.768 --> 00:32:05.908\nYou don't know why when you beat eggs and\nsugar and And I'm not a baker,\n\n548\n00:32:05.908 --> 00:32:10.240\nbut I know that most cakes carry eggs and\nsugar and flour.\n\n549\n00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.070\nYou don't know why that is such\nan important base for the cake, right?\n\n550\n00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.190\nBut it's just a recipe and\nyou follow it, right?\n\n551\n00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:19.740\nSo in order to center things horizontally,\n\n552\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.180\non the screen there's a little recipe\nthat you kind of have to follow.\n\n553\n00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.930\nSo let me go ahead and\nbring this back to display block.\n\n554\n00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.230\nRight here.\n\n555\n00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.710\nSo that we see these two.\n\n556\n00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.296\nAnd now they're both 50% width right?\n\n557\n00:32:34.296 --> 00:32:36.140\nWhat if I wanted to center them?\n\n558\n00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.000\nI wanted a center the actual element,\nnot the text inside of it, but\n\n559\n00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.520\nthe actual element.\n\n560\n00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.240\nWell, what I would do here is say,\nmargin: 0 auto.\n\n561\n00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.110\nAnd that's what I'm saying.\n\n562\n00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.130\nThat's what I mean when I say that\nthere's like a little CSS recipe.\n\n563\n00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:59.112\nI learned how to do this like four\nyears before it ever made sense to me.\n\n564\n00:32:59.112 --> 00:33:01.389\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, [LAUGH] that's why I'm saying it's\n\n565\n00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:02.320\nkind of a recipe.\n\n566\n00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.890\nIf you want to sense of it,\n\n567\n00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.850\nwhat's going on here is the margin, the\nfirst number is the top and bottom margin.\n\n568\n00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.970\nAnd the second number is the left and\nright margin.\n\n569\n00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.050\nBy saying that the left nad\nright margin automatic,\n\n570\n00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.120\nyour saying grab this box and\nput it in the middle of my screen.\n\n571\n00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.760\nSo instead of being stuck to the left\nit's gonna be int he middle of my screen.\n\n572\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.310\nAnd that the little recipe\nto center an element.\n\n573\n00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.440\nIt's worthy of noting that in order for\n\n574\n00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.530\nthe margin to have that effect you must be\ntalking about the display block element.\n\n575\n00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.890\nSo if I try this margins or\n\n576\n00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.040\nauto recipe we are displaying a line\nelement that's not gonna work.\n\n577\n00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.340\nSo anytime you want to center an image,\nyou want to center a heading or\n\n578\n00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.470\nanything like that, simplest thing\nto do just remember your recipe,\n\n579\n00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.680\ndisplay block, margin: 0 auto.\n\n580\n00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.478\n>> Fantastic.\n\n581\n00:33:43.478 --> 00:33:49.294\n>> And so this is the one\nlast thing I want to cover.\n\n582\n00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:52.666\nIn order to center the contents of\nan element, so we saw how the element is\n\n583\n00:33:52.666 --> 00:33:55.920\ncentered but the text inside of it\nis actually not centered, right?\n\n584\n00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.803\nIt's aligned to the left.\n\n585\n00:33:56.803 --> 00:33:57.771\n>> [CROSSTALK] the left line yeah.\n\n586\n00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:03.556\n>> Yeah, so you have to specify\nthat the actual text alignment,\n\n587\n00:34:03.556 --> 00:34:06.710\ntext-align, is left.\n\n588\n00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.380\nAnd once we do that, or not left.\n\n589\n00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.795\nI wanted to center it.\n\n590\n00:34:09.795 --> 00:34:10.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Center.\n\n591\n00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.960\nAnd once we do that,\nthen it'll be centered.\n\n592\n00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.220\nSo both the div, the paragraph and\nthe div, are centered.\n\n593\n00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.715\nSo that's the two main aspects\nof horizontal centering.\n\n594\n00:34:20.715 --> 00:34:25.095\nIn CSS vertical centering\nis a pretty nuance topic.\n\n595\n00:34:27.975 --> 00:34:30.365\nThe recipe is larger than two rules.\n\n596\n00:34:30.365 --> 00:34:34.459\nWe might get into it in a separate-\n>> Might be a little beyond the skill for\n\n597\n00:34:34.459 --> 00:34:35.064\nthis one.\n\n598\n00:34:35.064 --> 00:34:36.435\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, we might get to it.\n\n599\n00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:38.254\nDepending on the time we might get\nto it on the separate episode.\n\n600\n00:34:38.254 --> 00:34:38.894\n>> Okay.\n>> But\n\n601\n00:34:38.894 --> 00:34:43.410\npretty much this is like the baseline of\nrules that you really absolutely need\n\n602\n00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:44.360\nto know.\n\n603\n00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.870\nAnd the main pitfalls,\nlike centering stuff,\n\n604\n00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:51.790\nthe display styles, and the font sizing,\nthat you need to know, and\n\n605\n00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.670\nthe box model too,\nthat you need to know before going to CSS.\n\n606\n00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.460\n>> All right Victor.\n\n607\n00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.320\nGreat demonstrations and\ngreat explanations.\n\n608\n00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.040\nGetting us the basics of that\nCSS down that we need that,\n\n609\n00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.640\nkind of that foundational knowledge.\n\n610\n00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.430\nSetting some of those rules or\nexplaining how those rules work.\n\n611\n00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.200\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n612\n00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.270\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed

00:00:18.650\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.180\nAnd today, we're doing our HTML,\nCSS, and Bootstrap.\n\n5\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.634\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna go, we're going to be going into,\n\n6\n00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:29.454\nif I can slow it down just\na little bit and get that out,\n\n7\n00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:32.361\nwe're gonna be going into\nour responsive web design.\n\n8\n00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.845\nAnd here to help us with that,\nof course is, Mr Victor Moreno.\n\n9\n00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.130\nHow are you doing, Victor?\n\n10\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.250\n>> I'm doing great, Mike,\nthank you very much.\n\n11\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.700\nSo this concept,\nthis buzzword if you will,\n\n12\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.000\nof responsive web design\ngets thrown around a lot.\n\n13\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.120\nAnd sometimes, I hear people talking about\nit, they think it's the biggest deal, but\n\n14\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.410\ntruthfully, it's been around for\nyears already.\n\n15\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.930\nAnd what it means is that your website\nshould look good in every device.\n\n16\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.210\nAnd at this point and time,\nif you have one of those websites\n\n17\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.780\nthat if you open it up on your phone,\nthe font is made for ants.\n\n18\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.760\nAnd you need to hit zoom and\nnavigate sideways and\n\n19\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.170\ndo all sorts of crazy maneuvers,\nthat company is really behind the times.\n\n20\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.860\nAnd basically,\n\n21\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.780\nthat's what responsible web design is your\nwebsite has to look good in every device.\n\n22\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560\nSo if you look at my screen,\n\n23\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.690\nI'm gonna demonstrate how the ITProTV\nwebsite is actually responsive.\n\n24\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.140\nSo this section right here\nis three columns, right?\n\n25\n00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.750\nBecause we're on a desktop device and\n\n26\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.880\nit makes sense to structure your\ncontent in terms of columns.\n\n27\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.510\nBut if I were to make it bring\n\n28\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.030\nmy screen to the aspect ratio of\nwhat a phone would be, do you see?\n\n29\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.410\nThey're stacking on top of one another.\n\n30\n00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.550\nIt's no longer a three-column layout, but\nall the information is one single column.\n\n31\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.950\nAnd that's the trend with mobile design,\nthat all the information\n\n32\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.680\nshould be a single column and the pages\nshould just be longer, scrolling.\n\n33\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.140\nLarge texts, and just omit any kind\nof information that you need to omit.\n\n34\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.270\nIf we look at this website, this is a\nperfect example of responsive web design.\n\n35\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.900\nI bet you this section is also three\ncolumns if I expand the window.\n\n36\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.680\nHere we go, yes it is three columns.\n\n37\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.540\n>> Well, I'll have to give\nmy dev team a gold star and\n\n38\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.240\nlet them know that you approve.\n\n39\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.580\nBut it's something we gotta think about\nbecaus you really never know what platform\n\n40\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.070\nyour visitors, your viewers of your page,\nare going to be viewing from.\n\n41\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.726\n>> Yeah absolutely.\nAnd\n\n42\n00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:24.733\ndepending on the type of business\non average, just on average,\n\n43\n00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.867\nthe gross average,\n30% of web traffic is from mobile devices.\n\n44\n00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:31.230\n>> Wow.\n>> As people become,\n\n45\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.850\nas mobile devices become more and\nmore potent and\n\n46\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.110\nfaster, people are leaving\ntheir computers by the wayside.\n\n47\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.270\nI find a lot of people all\nthey have is a tablet and\n\n48\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.490\ntheir phone, their computer they\nhaven't upgraded it in nine years.\n\n49\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.870\nIt runs like a dinosaur, so\nthey don't even touch it.\n\n50\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.732\nIt's full of cobwebs\nat this point in time.\n\n51\n00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:49.070\n>> Well, that's true, I think about that.\n\n52\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.130\nI've got my laptop sitting on my\ncoffee table right in front of me and\n\n53\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.360\nthe girlfriend want to ask me\nsomething and what do I do?\n\n54\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.880\nI go get the iPad and\nI break it out and I start surfing.\n\n55\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.400\n>> But I bet you that laptop\nis a nice little coaster\n\n56\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.160\n>> Yes, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.030\n>> So another example of responsive web\ndesign is the FVI website right here.\n\n58\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.980\nJust within a section\nright here you can have\n\n59\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.275\nthat go from one column to two columns and\nthe background don't even changes.\n\n60\n00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:20.710\nBecause the little movie that's playing in\nthat background just does not look good\n\n61\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.610\nin this aspect ratio, so we just hide it.\n\n62\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.920\nAnd then this, I'm having\na little bit of rendering issues.\n\n63\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.840\nBut you get the idea right there that\nthe website is suppose to adjust\n\n64\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.980\nto the shape of the device.\n\n65\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.974\n>> That seems like a lot of work in\nthe background to make that happen.\n\n66\n00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:45.958\n>> Yeah, it definitely is a lot of work,\nbecause if you wanna do it by\n\n67\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.036\nhand basically what you have to do\nis create a little CSS meta rule,\n\n68\n00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:54.048\na rule to alter when other rules apply.\n\n69\n00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:56.727\nThat says hey, for devices of this\nscreen size to this screen size,\n\n70\n00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:58.188\nyou're gonna have all these rules.\n\n71\n00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:00.024\nFor devices of this screen\nsize to that screen size,\n\n72\n00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:03.130\nyou're gonna have all these other\nrules and it just takes a lot of time.\n\n73\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.020\nAnd that's when tools\nlike Bootstrap come in.\n\n74\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.180\nSo Bootstrap has a lot of that done for\nyou and\n\n75\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.040\nit's kind of awesome because\nit saves you so much time.\n\n76\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.198\nIf you just link the Sass from Bootstrap,\nyou're good to go and\n\n77\n00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:20.170\nyou're able to design column layouts\nthat adapt to mobile very quickly.\n\n78\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.500\nAnd we're gonna demonstrate that\na little bit later in the class.\n\n79\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.990\nBut first I wanna talk to you a little\nbit about Bootstrap, where to get it.\n\n80\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.480\nIf you go to getbootstrap.com,\nthat would be how you would get started.\n\n81\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.170\nYou would click on actually\nGetting Started at the top there.\n\n82\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.710\nAnd all you have to do, you could\ndownload the source code to Bootstrap and\n\n83\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.450\nincorporate it through\nyour project that way.\n\n84\n00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.830\nAnd that makes sense.\n\n85\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.439\nBut they provide what's called\nthe content delivery network or CDN.\n\n86\n00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:57.455\nSo a CDN, basically, kind of layman's\nterms, is a cloud that delivers assets.\n\n87\n00:04:57.455 --> 00:05:00.673\nSo that Bootstrap-style sheet\nthat I link right here,\n\n88\n00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:04.858\nthat I bring over here with this link\nIs not contained in a single server.\n\n89\n00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:07.030\nIt's contained in\na content delivery network.\n\n90\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.910\nSo it's actually, if you're gonna\nput your network in production,\n\n91\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.270\nit's worth considering just leaving\nthe link coming from the CDN.\n\n92\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.000\nBecause it's much more that your\n\n93\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.810\nwebsite is gonna go down\nthen their CDN going down.\n\n94\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.630\n>> True.\n\n95\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.790\n>> So you're not gonna have problems.\n\n96\n00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.430\nEven though it does introduce,\ntechnically, another point of failure.\n\n97\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.678\nThe probability that a CDN fails is so\nlow it doesn't really affect anything.\n\n98\n00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:33.800\nAlthough once you're more evolved and\n\n99\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.620\nyour software and\nyour company is a little more evolved.\n\n100\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.670\nAnd you have better servers and\nbetter resources, and\n\n101\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.530\nyour web developers have better tools.\n\n102\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.360\nThen it definitely makes sense\nto download that stylesheet and\n\n103\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.940\nthen do some of the processing that.\n\n104\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.700\nI think I alluded to earlier, where you\ncan have all your stylesheets chained\n\n105\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.460\ntogether and packaged into one and\nserve only one stylesheet.\n\n106\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.250\nAnd you can do that with\nJavaScript files as well.\n\n107\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.100\nSo it's just a matter of where\nyour development team is at and\n\n108\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.690\nwhere your priorities are at.\n\n109\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.150\nBut I went ahead and I created a new\n\n110\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.935\nfolder on my desktop that's\ncalled Bootstrap Lesson.\n\n111\n00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.652\nAnd I opened it with Atom right here.\n\n112\n00:06:12.652 --> 00:06:16.335\nI pre-downloaded this and some images\nthat I'm gonna use at a later lesson.\n\n113\n00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:20.475\nAnd what I'm going to do now is\nI'm going to create a new file and\n\n114\n00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:22.560\nmake sure that it's not\ninside the Images folder.\n\n115\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.491\nIndex.HTML, I'm gonna start\nby typing the doctype,\n\n116\n00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:34.565\nStatement inside there, have my HTML\ntag and inside there have head.\n\n117\n00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:38.824\nSo this is something that you're\nprobably not gonna remember the 100 or\n\n118\n00:06:38.824 --> 00:06:40.835\n200 times you do it.\n\n119\n00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:44.435\nSo you would just Google it,\nstructure of an HTML document.\n\n120\n00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:47.225\nGoogle is the name of the game when you're\nin this, you're not gonna remember a lot\n\n121\n00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:51.050\nof this stuff and you can just\nGoogle it from what I used to do.\n\n122\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.180\nYes, I would, for example, if I didn't\nremember how to link a style sheet,\n\n123\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.070\nI would Google HTML links\nstyle sheet w3 schools.\n\n124\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.220\nAnd that would take me straight\nto the link from w3 schools and\n\n125\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.500\nI know they have real easy explanations,\nreal simple examples.\n\n126\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.610\nAnd that's what I would\ndo if I didn't remember.\n\n127\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.160\nBut since we're linking straight from the\nCDN, we're just gonna copy this link and\n\n128\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.140\npaste it there into the header.\n\n129\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.246\nWe're gonna also copy the JavaScript.\n\n130\n00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:20.472\nEven though I don't think we're\ngonna use it in this episode, but\n\n131\n00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:21.797\nwe're gonna use it on a later episode.\n\n132\n00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:24.740\nI don't wanna forget to link it.\n\n133\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.048\nAnd then we're going to add our title,\ntitle.\n\n134\n00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:33.380\nSo Bootstrap Grid and\n\n135\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.060\nwe're gonna talk about what that\nconcept of grid means in a second.\n\n136\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.794\nAnd that's it, that's all I need in order\nto start using the Bootstrap things,\n\n137\n00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:46.493\nthat it allows me to do.\n\n138\n00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:50.568\nI would recommend that before you,\nobviously you can follow along with this,\n\n139\n00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:52.975\nbut before you try to\ntackle your own project,\n\n140\n00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.398\nyou should probably\nspend some time reading.\n\n141\n00:07:55.398 --> 00:08:00.800\nThe CSS section of the documentation\nright here.You click on CSS.\n\n142\n00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.540\nThe most important part is this\nright here, the grid system.\n\n143\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.620\nAnd I'm actually gonna explain that for\nyou right now in a second.\n\n144\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.607\nBut before I get into\nthe particulars of the grid system,\n\n145\n00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:18.101\nI wanna talk about how you should be\nthinking about your web design in general.\n\n146\n00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:22.680\nAnd how you should be thinking\nabout structuring your HTML.\n\n147\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.870\nA big mistake that I see\na lot of students make\n\n148\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.900\nis they'll look at something like this,\nit's ITProTV website.\n\n149\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.650\nAnd they'll think, okay,\nso in order to do this,\n\n150\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.900\nI need that navigation bar at the top,\nso that's my first element.\n\n151\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.480\nThen I need this, an element that\nhas this little title right here and\n\n152\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.320\nthis little paragraph,\nCourses Developed Specifically for IT.\n\n153\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.940\nSo I need that element right there,\njust floating there, and\n\n154\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.190\nthen I need this image off to the right,\nnext to the right edge of the page.\n\n155\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.130\nAnd that's not really an efficient\nway to think about things.\n\n156\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.670\nBecause what that leads to is the student\nwill just try to use specific\n\n157\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.580\npixel values for margin right here\npixel values for margin right here.\n\n158\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.510\nAnd it'll create a mess.\n\n159\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.010\nIt's just not gonna work.\n\n160\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.790\nHow you should be thinking about designing\nyour html is you should think about\n\n161\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.720\nhorizontal slices.\n\n162\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.970\nYour page is composed\nof horizontal slices.\n\n163\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.420\nSo this first section right here,\n\n164\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.560\nwith the white background, that's one\nof the slices, and it has two columns.\n\n165\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.440\nSo we can create that layout.\n\n166\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.310\nWe're gonna go into how to create\nthat layout with the bootstrap grid\n\n167\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.400\nin a minute.\n\n168\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.170\nBut just thinking about the fact that\nthere needs to be a big container\n\n169\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.270\nthat contains everything\nthat's in this section.\n\n170\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.090\nSo there's a big div that it's role\nis only basically creating a little\n\n171\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.220\nmini document that's a horizontal\nslice of the bigger document.\n\n172\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.240\nNow, when we get to the next section\nwe're gonna see the same thing.\n\n173\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.840\nThe light gray background right\nhere with these three columns,\n\n174\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.660\nthat's gonna be one big div that's going\nto have that light gray background.\n\n175\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.610\nAnd inside there, we're gonna\nhave these three little columns.\n\n176\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.070\nAnd then this green\nsection is another slice.\n\n177\n00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.710\nAnd then finally this starting\nfrom above the video,\n\n178\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.790\nprobably to right above\nthis three column section.\n\n179\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.680\nThat's another slice.\n\n180\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.160\nThe three column section is another slice.\n\n181\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.790\nSo anytime that you need to change\nstructure you're gonna think of that as\n\n182\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.630\na full slice of your page, and that's how\nyou're gonna get started with your design.\n\n183\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.740\nSo, lets talk about now\nthat Bootstrap grid and\n\n184\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.450\nhow that's gonna look,\nwhat that looks like in practice.\n\n185\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.580\nSo first of all, in order to create\nany kind of sections like that, and\n\n186\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.850\nbefore we can create any of those slices.\n\n187\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:40.469\nIt's recommended that we enclose all our\ncontent in a div with the class container.\n\n188\n00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:44.284\nYeah, and then inside there,\n\n189\n00:10:44.284 --> 00:10:48.200\neach one of those slices is gonna\nbe a div with a class, row.\n\n190\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.480\nIt's gonna be represented\nby a div with a class, row.\n\n191\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.010\n>> I see, so\nthe container is the entire page.\n\n192\n00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.533\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n193\n00:10:56.533 --> 00:10:58.940\nthen each one of those slices\nis a row within that page.\n\n194\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.930\n>> Exactly, and you can do multiple\ncontainers back to back too.\n\n195\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.140\nYeah, you can do another\ncontainer right here.\n\n196\n00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.400\nUsually, there's no need to.\n\n197\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.485\nYou can just have the class, row, and\nsometimes your markup gets so big, and\n\n198\n00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.085\nyou have so\nmany lines of code that it's useful.\n\n199\n00:11:12.085 --> 00:11:13.905\nPeople find it useful to\ndo something like this.\n\n200\n00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:15.515\nThey do HTML comments.\n\n201\n00:11:15.515 --> 00:11:18.725\nSo they open the angle bracket.\n\n202\n00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:23.440\nExclamation, dash dash and\nthen, START First row.\n\n203\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.950\nAnd then, this is an HTML comment.\n\n204\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.460\nSo it is an actual line of HTML code\nthat gets ignored by the browser.\n\n205\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.100\nIt does not get rendered on screen.\n\n206\n00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.934\nAnd that is why in programming languages,\nthey call those comments.\n\n207\n00:11:35.934 --> 00:11:39.937\nAnything that you write in order to make\nyour code more legible to other humans,\n\n208\n00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:41.022\nis called a comment.\n\n209\n00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:44.776\nAnd it's gonna be ignored by\nthe interpreter or compiler,\n\n210\n00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:46.210\nwhatever it might be.\n\n211\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.330\nNow inside that row we can create columns.\n\n212\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.250\nSo the row is gonna be a slice\nof the entire screen and\n\n213\n00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.780\nthen we are gonna create a three\ncolumn layout that's going to become\n\n214\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.180\ncolumn stacked on top of one\nanother in a cellphone display.\n\n215\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.160\nSo in order to do that we first\ncreate the div class, and\n\n216\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.490\nthese are just the Bootstrap class names.\n\n217\n00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.465\nAnd it refers to a concept,\nthe grid concept,\n\n218\n00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.110\nthat I've been mentioning over and\nover, what is that grid?\n\n219\n00:12:16.396 --> 00:12:22.020\nThe grid is an arbitrary imaginary\ndefinition where you break up\n\n220\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.380\nyour container or\nyour screen into 12 sections.\n\n221\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.090\n>> So if you want to create a two-column\nlayout then each of your columns is gonna\n\n222\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.340\nbe six out of the 12 columns\nthat make up the entire screen.\n\n223\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.250\nIf you wanna create a three-column layout,\nthen each column is going to\n\n224\n00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.621\nbe four out of the 12 imaginary columns\nthat make up the entire screen.\n\n225\n00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:42.840\nSo that's what the grid is.\n\n226\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.410\nSo I'm gonna start by just\nsaying right here, col and\n\n227\n00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.310\nthen for large screen size,\nthis is gonna be 4.\n\n228\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:56.450\nAnd here I'm gonna type this is column 1.\n\n229\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.600\nThen after that, still inside my row.\n\n230\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.770\nYou see, still inside my row,\nI'm going to create.\n\n231\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.166\nI'm just gonna copy this and paste it\nright here, so that's the second column.\n\n232\n00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.740\nAnd notice that's a second\ncolumn still inside my row.\n\n233\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.070\nSo the div, even though it's underneath\nthe other one and even though divs are by\n\n234\n00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.430\ndefault, a block column that's\ngonna stack on top of one another.\n\n235\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.290\nWhen I apply these column classes,\nthey no longer do that.\n\n236\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.620\nSo Bootstrap takes care of all\nthe heavy lifting for you, and\n\n237\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.090\nthey use that float concept that\nI mentioned was confusing and\n\n238\n00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.050\ndifficult to deal with\nin the last episode.\n\n239\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.910\nBut they do it well, so you don't have to\nworry about any of the shortcomings of it.\n\n240\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.094\nThis is column 2, and\nthen let's see if that's working.\n\n241\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:40.981\nLet's me see, preview this thing.\n\n242\n00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:44.076\nSo there we go, so\nwe have column one, column two.\n\n243\n00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:49.610\nAnd then in here I'm going\nto create the third column.\n\n244\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.740\nBut I'm gonna leave it empty.\n\n245\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.770\nCuz this is a common\npitfall with students.\n\n246\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.850\nIf I leave that empty, and\nI go ahead and inspect the page,\n\n247\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.027\nlook what's going to happen.\n\n248\n00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.492\nI have my first column, right.\n\n249\n00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:06.036\nMy second is nice there.\n\n250\n00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:09.251\nMy third column, wait a minute,\nis not getting highlighted.\n\n251\n00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:15.137\nAnd if I take a look at what it's\nsaying about the size of the column,\n\n252\n00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:19.470\nit says width 390 by one pixel height.\n\n253\n00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.620\nWhy is that?\n\n254\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.860\nWell because I have no content in there.\n\n255\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.050\nThe div doesn't actually\nhave anything inside of it.\n\n256\n00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.060\nIt collapses on top of itself.\n\n257\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.570\nSo that's a common pitfall and that's why\nwhen you're first learning these layouts,\n\n258\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.960\njust write something in there.\n\n259\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.930\nJust some gibberish,\n\n260\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.860\nanything that you write in there will\nactually give the div some height, and\n\n261\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.910\nthen you'll be able to see that you\nhave your three column layout working.\n\n262\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.760\nSo now, what I specified right here\n\n263\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.710\nis already good enough to\ncreate a responsive layout.\n\n264\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.680\nYou see when I shrink\nthe the width of my screen,\n\n265\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.060\nthey're stacking on top of one another.\n\n266\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.360\nAnd that's because what\nthis little class does is,\n\n267\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.470\nit basically says, hey look, for\nscreen sizes large and above.\n\n268\n00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.980\nAnd I believe largest 1024 pixels, so\nanything above 1024 pixels in width for\n\n269\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.880\nyour scree,n then this\ndiv is only gonna take up\n\n270\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.340\nfour out of the 12 columns of the screen,\nso one-third of the screen.\n\n271\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.540\nSame thing for this one,\nfor screen sizes large and\n\n272\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.140\nabove, it's gonna take up one-third of\nthe screen, and same thing for this one.\n\n273\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.568\nNow, for screen sizes under that 1024,\nor whatever it might be,\n\n274\n00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:34.822\nI'm pretty sure it's 1024, then you go\nback to the default behavior of a div,\n\n275\n00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:37.021\nwhich is full width, the screen.\n\n276\n00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:41.817\n>> So what I tend to do and what I tend\nto see a lot of in the code that I've\n\n277\n00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:46.104\ninherited, is that even though\nthis already responsive,\n\n278\n00:15:46.104 --> 00:15:50.843\nthey go ahead and specify that,\nlet's go ahead col-xs-12.\n\n279\n00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:55.676\nSo for extra small devices, and\nanything between extra small and large.\n\n280\n00:15:55.676 --> 00:15:57.558\nWe're gonna span the entire 12 columns.\n\n281\n00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:59.753\nSo they go ahead and\nexplicitly state it, just so\n\n282\n00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:03.604\nthat you see what's going on more easily,\nand you don't have to infer, yeah, but\n\n283\n00:16:03.604 --> 00:16:05.710\nthat's because of\nthe default div behavior.\n\n284\n00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:06.680\nYou have it all right here.\n\n285\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.820\nYou have all the behavior\nspecified right here.\n\n286\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.010\nSo that make sense, Mike?\n\n287\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.600\n>> Absolutely, that's very cool.\n\n288\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.520\nAnd really not that difficult,\nI guess, like you said,\n\n289\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.600\nit's Bootstrap in the background\nthat's doing the heavy lifting.\n\n290\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.330\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nit's a lot that they do for you.\n\n291\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.242\n>> Yeah.\n>> So normally,\n\n292\n00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:25.597\nit takes me like eight hours to get\ninto all the things that you need\n\n293\n00:16:25.597 --> 00:16:29.756\nto know before you can implement the\nBootstrap grade functionality on your own.\n\n294\n00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:32.356\nSo they're really doing a lot for us, and\n\n295\n00:16:32.356 --> 00:16:37.353\nit really makes little sense not to use\nsuch a powerful tool if it's available.\n\n296\n00:16:37.353 --> 00:16:39.910\n>> Why reinvent the wheel,\nas we like to say, right?\n\n297\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.820\n>> Why reinvent the wheel?\n\n298\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.410\nWhy control your computer with your feet?\n\n299\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.544\nIt doesn't make sense.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.490\n>> Let me see, so you can actually specify\n\n301\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.800\nmore granular detail than this,\nas to how you want your layout to behave.\n\n302\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.840\nSo for instance, let me go ahead and\napply the convention\n\n303\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.070\nthat I said we should apply by adding\nthe col-xs-12 style to all of them.\n\n304\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.680\nI'm saying here, for extra small screens,\nit's gonna span the entire width.\n\n305\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.310\nAnd for large and above screens,\nit's gonna span 4 out of 12 columns.\n\n306\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.160\nBut what if I want a middle ground?\n\n307\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.300\nMaybe for iPad displays, I want this one.\n\n308\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:25.287\nSo for medium, col-md, for Apple displays,\nI want this one to be 12, and\n\n309\n00:17:25.287 --> 00:17:30.678\nthe other two to be 6 and\n6, col-md-6, col-md-6.\n\n310\n00:17:30.678 --> 00:17:34.338\nAnd what that's gonna do is at a certain\npoint between the extra small and\n\n311\n00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:37.698\nthe large size, I'm gonna have a layout,\nthat's the first div,\n\n312\n00:17:37.698 --> 00:17:42.340\ncolumn one is right on top, and the other\ntwo are two-column layouts side by side.\n\n313\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.345\nSo let's see that in action.\n\n314\n00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:50.305\nRefresh, so in the extra small layout,\nwe still see what we saw before,\n\n315\n00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:54.800\nand as I get a little bit larger,\nThere we go.\n\n316\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.650\nThis column is stacked on top.\n\n317\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.280\nAnd by the way,\nthe reason it looks weird like that is\n\n318\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.990\njust cuz the contents aren't centered.\n\n319\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.331\nBut if we look at the actual div,\n\n320\n00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.380\nyou see it spanning the whole\nwidth of the container.\n\n321\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.060\nAnd then the next one is half\nof the width of the container.\n\n322\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.830\nAnd that one is also half of\nthe width of the container.\n\n323\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.360\nSo that's the layout\nthat I was talking about.\n\n324\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.150\nAnd then finally, when we get to\nthe extra large style of display,\n\n325\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.650\nwe have the three columns\nthat we originally did.\n\n326\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.530\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n327\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.340\nNo more coding three different versions of\nyour page for different sized devices and\n\n328\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.160\nthen trying to run\nsomething in the beginning.\n\n329\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.720\nOkay, let me determine what their device\nis and what their resolution is, so\n\n330\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.430\nI can pick which layout I wanna use.\n\n331\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.170\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n332\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.189\nIt's all kind of pretty well thought out.\n\n333\n00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:38.996\nIt's not 100% bulletproof because\nthere's those edge devices that'll\n\n334\n00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:41.800\nhave some incredible high resolution.\n\n335\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.260\nBut just the way that the aspect ratio\nworks out when you're looking at it\n\n336\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.990\nvertically, it just edges a little\nbit over that excess size,\n\n337\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.250\nso it picks up the medium layout,\nand it just doesn't look good.\n\n338\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.660\nBut 98% of the time, it's gonna look\npretty good, and 100% of the time,\n\n339\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.260\nit's gonna save you like [LAUGH] so\nmuch time and so much effort.\n\n340\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.255\nSo that's the basic concept of the grid.\n\n341\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.080\nLet me see, and just to recap\nwhat we have been talking about,\n\n342\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.660\nthe main thing here is to think about when\nyou're creating the entire structure of\n\n343\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.010\nyour page, the main thing is to\nthink about your page as slices.\n\n344\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.190\nSo to go back to this one,\n\n345\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.300\nthe first slice that we have here\nis the navigation bar at the top.\n\n346\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.380\nThe second slice is the carousel here.\n\n347\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.730\nThat blue section is another slice,\nthis section right here is another slice.\n\n348\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.073\nThis section right here is another slice,\nand inside here,\n\n349\n00:19:42.073 --> 00:19:46.085\nthis is an h1, and\nI actually know cuz I worked on this.\n\n350\n00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:49.379\nThis is a paragraph,\nthey're both displayed in block, and\n\n351\n00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:52.674\neven though there's an h1 and\na paragraph inside this row,\n\n352\n00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:57.277\nyou can just have columns after it, and\nthey will behave correctly, like columns.\n\n353\n00:19:57.277 --> 00:19:59.500\nSo let me demonstrate that.\n\n354\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.108\nYou can have at the top of the row,\nyou can have some kind of title, h1,\n\n355\n00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:06.740\nThis is a grid demo.\n\n356\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:13.790\nAnd it will actually not interfere\nwith your column layout, you see?\n\n357\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.930\nSo your columns will work just fine,\n\n358\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.470\nif you include a regular block element at\nthe top of one of your rows, that's fine.\n\n359\n00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.650\nAnd your column layouts\nwon't be interrupted.\n\n360\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.300\nAnd so we talked about Bootstrap,\n\n361\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.160\nwe talked about the way to\nthink about your markup, and we\n\n362\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.894\ntalked about what responsive design is and\nhow to structure your markup responsively.\n\n363\n00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:41.870\nSo we're gonna really leave it to\nthe next episode to take a real\n\n364\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.270\ndeep dive into how to go through\nthe Bootstrap documentation right here and\n\n365\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.040\nreally build a page using all the examples\nthat they have provided for us here.\n\n366\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.190\n>> Fantastic.\n\n367\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.450\nAll right, Victor, again,\n\n368\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.860\njust great episode, great demonstrations\nthat are really making things clear,\n\n369\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.130\nmaking Bootstrap seem pretty easy and\na really cool concept, right?\n\n370\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.002\nSaving us a lot of the work, allowing\nus to put more effort in the design and\n\n371\n00:21:03.002 --> 00:21:06.938\nmaking it pretty and do what we want it\nto do, rather than try to figure out,\n\n372\n00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:09.935\nhow is this gonna look on 14\ndifferent sized screens and\n\n373\n00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.391\ndifferent resolutions and\nthings like that.\n\n374\n00:21:12.391 --> 00:21:15.670\nSo fantastic, we thank you for\nthat and those great resources.\n\n375\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.370\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n376\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.970\nSigning off for

00:00:21.869\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and today\nwe're doing our HTML, CSS, and BootStrap,\n\n4\n00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.479\nand specifically in this episode we're\ngonna take a deeper look into bootstrap.\n\n5\n00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.087\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nVictor Moreno, how you doing Victor?\n\n6\n00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:32.941\n>> I'm doing great Mike thanks for\nhaving me.\n\n7\n00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.678\nWhat we're gonna do today is we're\nactually gonna build a page using\n\n8\n00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:39.385\nthe examples from\nthe Bootstrap documentation to\n\n9\n00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.671\nsee how all of this can become\na little bit less daunting, and\n\n10\n00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:46.939\nwe're using the tool that is Bootstrap\nin the documentation and the example.\n\n11\n00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.796\nAll we basically need to do is copy and\npaste code,\n\n12\n00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:54.558\ncustomize it, understand a little bit\nabout what's going on, customize it, and\n\n13\n00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:59.319\nthen we're gonna have a nice, decent\nlooking layout, instead of struggling with\n\n14\n00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.107\nthat hideous thing [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH] Like our first page we\n\n15\n00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:02.624\ndid, yeah.\n\n16\n00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n17\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.640\nSo if you come, if you look over at my\nscreen, one thing that I'm going to\n\n18\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.510\ndo before we go on is I'm going to\ntalk about this meta view port tag.\n\n19\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.850\nSo META tags are things,\nare a type of tag that go into\n\n20\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.240\nthe header section that modify\nthe behavior of the page.\n\n21\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.720\nIt's very common to us\na META tag to specify,\n\n22\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.620\nexplicitly specify, how your content\nis gonna be displayed on mobile device.\n\n23\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.684\nSo for example you can use the META Tag\nthat is named viewport to say for\n\n24\n00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:40.492\nexample that you cannot scale a page.\n\n25\n00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:47.509\nAnd this would disable the users\nfrom being able to scale your page.\n\n26\n00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.119\nAnd you can also specify what's\nthe initial width, the initial scale,\n\n27\n00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.072\nmaximum scale, or user scalable, and\n\n28\n00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:57.060\nall of that stuff is going to disable the\nuser from being able to scale your page.\n\n29\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.900\nSo I'm just gonna add that\nhere cuz it's good practice.\n\n30\n00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.720\nIt's also good practice to\nspecify the character set.\n\n31\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo in short, what a character set is,\n\n32\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.290\nwe all know that everything\nat the end of the day,\n\n33\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.160\neverything in computing at the end of\nthe day boils down to zeros and ones.\n\n34\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.490\nBut very few of us knows how\nthat process actually works.\n\n35\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.390\nBut you do know that the letter A has\nsome kind of binary representation.\n\n36\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.330\nThe letter B has some other\nkind of binary representation.\n\n37\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.290\nAnd so on.\n\n38\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.030\nAnd you could choose for the letter A to\nbe 13, or to be 17 and binary or whatever.\n\n39\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.704\nAnd that's what a charset is.\n\n40\n00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:40.483\nSo, like a table that specifies, A is this\nbinary value, B is this binary value,\n\n41\n00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:41.123\nand so on.\n\n42\n00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:47.738\nAnd if we wanna specify the charset,\ncharset, utf-8 is the most common one.\n\n43\n00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:50.240\nSo that's another thing\nthat's good practice,\n\n44\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.570\nnow we're going to set\nup our project folder.\n\n45\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.730\nThe way that it would it work if\nwe'regoing to make a long-term website,\n\n46\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.780\nwe're going to create\na new folder here for CSS.\n\n47\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.610\nWe're going to create a new\nfolder here for JavaScript, JS.\n\n48\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.780\nAnd that's where we would put our custom\nstyle sheet on our custom JavaScript.\n\n49\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.570\nAnd then we're gonna get started.\n\n50\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.470\nI'm gonna get rid of all the contents of\nthat row cuz I don't wanna add it again.\n\n51\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.040\nAnd in order to know what to delete,\nfirst of all,\n\n52\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.460\nit's vital that you keep\nyour tabs in order.\n\n53\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnything that's inside the row should\nbe tabbed at least one level over.\n\n54\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.390\nAnd what that allows you to do is very\nquickly visually inspect if I click on\n\n55\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.660\nthe opening div right here Adam underlines\nfor me, and most text editors, Sublime and\n\n56\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.620\nBrackets will do this too,\nit underlines the.\n\n57\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.400\nSo if I wanna delete\nthe contents of that row, or\n\n58\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.900\nthe row itself, I would make\nsure to start here and end here.\n\n59\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.850\nAnd that's if I wanna\ndelete the row itself.\n\n60\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.680\nIf I wanna delete the contents of the row,\n\n61\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.700\nI would make sure to only delete the stuff\nthat's between those two underline tags.\n\n62\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.810\nSo I'm gonna delete this right now.\n\n63\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.520\n>> So\nmaking sure that it's indented properly or\n\n64\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.020\nformatted properly in\nthe actual HTML document.\n\n65\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.160\nYou don't wanna accidentally\ndelete a closing tag for\n\n66\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.890\nsomething you're leaving or\nsomething like that.\n\n67\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.770\n>> Absolutely, and that is the biggest and\n\n68\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.740\nmost dangerous pitfall when\nyou're starting out with this.\n\n69\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.580\nYou're trying to speed\nthrough the process.\n\n70\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.410\nYou're pasting stuff.\n\n71\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.080\nYou're not indenting correctly.\n\n72\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.640\nYou just missed one tag,\nyou select the wrong thing.\n\n73\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.575\nAnd you delete a bunch of HTML without\none closing tag, and that is it.\n\n74\n00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:30.230\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n>> Your document is done.\n\n75\n00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.680\nYou pretty much have to\nstart over at that point.\n\n76\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.330\nNot always, but\nin many cases you'll pretty much,\n\n77\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.960\nyou're gonna have to start over.\n\n78\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.020\nI'm gonna add another HTML comment\nhere to say that END FIRST ROW.\n\n79\n00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:49.565\nAnd so let's get started with actually\ngoing through the documentation and\n\n80\n00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.265\nusing their examples to build our page.\n\n81\n00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:56.905\nThere's three main sections with\nthe documentation, CSS, Components, and\n\n82\n00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:57.485\nJavaScript.\n\n83\n00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:00.875\nI usually have to click all three\nto find what I'm looking for.\n\n84\n00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:07.710\nSo now that I'm in CSS, I'm gonna try\nto find the nav bar My Ctrl+F is not.\n\n85\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.770\nThere we go.\n\n86\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.400\nNavbar.\n\n87\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.100\nLet me see.\n\n88\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.830\nIt's not here.\n\n89\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.000\nThis is just images, buttons and so on.\n\n90\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.850\nSo it's probably going to be\nin the Components section.\n\n91\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.570\nGoodness.\n\n92\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.879\nMy mouse is giving me grief.\n\n93\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.540\nJust gonna have to page up.\n\n94\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.530\nAll right.\nComponents section and let me see,\n\n95\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.770\nis the navigation bar here?\n\n96\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.800\nThere we go.\n\n97\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.500\nSo we found the nav section right here and\nthere's a bunch of examples.\n\n98\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500\nThere's a bunch of little components\nthat the navigation bar can have.\n\n99\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.850\nAnd if you go to the nav bar section\nright here then you can see,\n\n100\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.180\nyou can read a bunch of stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.850\nYou always need to read the stuff before.\n\n102\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.890\nIt tells you here about how\nthe overflow in content behaves.\n\n103\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.940\nIt tells me here that it requires\na JavaScript, which we did insert.\n\n104\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.050\nThe script tag right here,\nwe inserted that in the last episode.\n\n105\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.490\nAnd, Here is our example.\n\n106\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.207\nSo this is really busy, so as you can see,\nthey build examples that pretty much\n\n107\n00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:19.852\nhave anything that you would\nwant to possibly have there, so\n\n108\n00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:25.170\nthat all you have to do is delete things,\nrather than build your navigation bar.\n\n109\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.860\nSo I'm going to grab from here to\nthe closing of the navigation bar.\n\n110\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.121\nHere we go.\nI'm gonna copy all of that and\n\n111\n00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:39.748\npaste it into the body of a my,\nright above the container,\n\n112\n00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:45.865\nyou can put it inside the container too,\nbut it doesn't look as good.\n\n113\n00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:46.445\nLet me tell you why.\n\n114\n00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:48.325\nThe Bootstrap container,\n\n115\n00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:51.345\none of the things it does that you\ncouldn't see as well on my screen,\n\n116\n00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:56.077\ncuz it's a small laptop, is it restricts\nthe maximum width of that element.\n\n117\n00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:58.020\nSo that if you have a dev\nwith the class container,\n\n118\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.070\none of the reasons you do that is to\nput all your content in there, so\n\n119\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.000\nthat when people are looking at your page\nin a super mega wide screen monitor,\n\n120\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.150\nit doesn't look so spread out.\n\n121\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.550\nCause sometimes you can have a paragraph\nthat's a three or a three and\n\n122\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.710\na half line paragraph, and somebody\nthat has one of these 21 by 9 monitors,\n\n123\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.890\nit just looks like one wimpy little line.\n\n124\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.320\nSo, you don't want that to happen.\n\n125\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.580\nAnd that's why they do these containers\nto restrict the maximum width\n\n126\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.090\nto make it look kind of like a vertical\npage instead of just this gigantic thing.\n\n127\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:34.900\nSo for that reason, because the container\nactually limits the width of your screen,\n\n128\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.980\nthat is why I put the nav bar outside\nthe container, cuz I want nav bar,\n\n129\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.140\nkind of the standard is to make\nyour nav bars look like this,\n\n130\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.230\nthey span the entire width of the screen.\n\n131\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:52.035\nSo I pasted it there and notice that\nthe indentation's a little bit messed up.\n\n132\n00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:56.214\nCuz this navigation bar is really a sister\nelement of the div class container,\n\n133\n00:07:56.214 --> 00:07:58.633\nand yet\nit's not indented to the same level.\n\n134\n00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.813\nAnd that just happens because when you're\ncopying and pasting, that's gonna happen.\n\n135\n00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:06.040\nSo, I'm going to select from there\nall the way to the opening nav,\n\n136\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.450\ncuz the opening nav is\nprobably indented correctly.\n\n137\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.430\nYep, the opening nav is indented\none level over from the body.\n\n138\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.070\nAnd then I'm going to indent this one,\ntwo levels.\n\n139\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.060\nSo that this div with its own\ncontainer is inside that nav.\n\n140\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.306\nSo now I have all my indentation in order,\nvery critical.\n\n141\n00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:29.729\nI do recommend that you spend time\ngetting your indentation in order is very\n\n142\n00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:30.337\nimportant.\n\n143\n00:08:30.337 --> 00:08:32.090\nNow we're going to look\nat all this code and\n\n144\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.780\ntry to figure out a little\nbit about what's going on.\n\n145\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.378\nAnd how we're going to do this,\nwe're going to save and\n\n146\n00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:37.990\nwe're gonna preview it in our browser.\n\n147\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.580\nSo, just as promised,\nall this code that I pasted,\n\n148\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.610\nlook at this, and look at what\nI have on my page Is the same.\n\n149\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.860\n>> Nice.\n>> Right?\n\n150\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.460\nSo let's look through-\n>> That saves you hours of work\n\n151\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.520\nright there, doesn't it?\n\n152\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.590\n>> Yeah, especially if I\nneeded a lot of this stuff,\n\n153\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.870\nmy page is gonna be a lot simpler.\n\n154\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.550\nBut yeah, if I needed a lot of this stuff,\nit saves you so much.\n\n155\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.730\nI'm gonna figure out from here first.\n\n156\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.035\nIn the Developer Tools, you can make\nedits and the edits just won't stick.\n\n157\n00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:10.190\nThey won't actually affect your file,\nbut it'll affect the way that it looks.\n\n158\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.052\nSo I'm gonna try to figure out from here,\nwhat to delete.\n\n159\n00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:21.250\nSo, and it's also nicer to look at\nyour the code that you pasted in here,\n\n160\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.790\nbecause it has this these little things so\nthat it collapses.\n\n161\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.830\nSo I can look at my nav element.\n\n162\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.350\nAll it has inside of it is\na div class container fluid.\n\n163\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.130\nAnd that is the one that has\neverything inside of it, so\n\n164\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.660\nI have the nav bar header here.\n\n165\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.660\nI don't want to delete that,\nI would probably replace it with a logo\n\n166\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.410\ninstead of a word brand,\nif I wanted to make a real website.\n\n167\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.870\nAnd then inside this element is\nwhere all the magic happens.\n\n168\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.580\nSo this ul that says nav navbar nav\n\n169\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.630\nis the one that has these\nthree elements right here.\n\n170\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.970\nSo if I want to delete this dropdown\nelement, I just right here, click and\n\n171\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.536\ndelete.\n\n172\n00:09:56.536 --> 00:10:00.920\nIf I mouse over this whole form,\n\n173\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.810\nthen I can figure out what the browser\nhighlights for me what that is.\n\n174\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.260\nAnd I can figure out if I delete\nthat whole form now I kind of have\n\n175\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.110\nmore in line with what I want to have.\n\n176\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.010\nThen we have this other ul,\nthat’s a nav bar to the right.\n\n177\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.760\nAnd I can expand it and\njust get rid of this dropdown class.\n\n178\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.190\nAnd now I need to decide whether\nI want my nav bar to the left.\n\n179\n00:10:25.388 --> 00:10:32.245\nAnd I wanna keep this one, or\nI wanna keep the one that is to the right.\n\n180\n00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:35.689\nSo I am just going to\ndelete this one altogether.\n\n181\n00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:38.870\nAnd now I cleaned it up, and\nI have only what I need.\n\n182\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.560\nSo now I'm going to look and\nanalyze what is going on here.\n\n183\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.761\nInside my nav element there's\na container fluid, and\n\n184\n00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:51.155\ninside that there's a nav bar header,\nand inside that.\n\n185\n00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:52.560\nNo actually, I ignored all of that.\n\n186\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.950\nAnd inside, side by side, with the nav bar\nheader, there's this div class collapse,\n\n187\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.370\nnav bar collapse.\n\n188\n00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.260\nAnd that's where everything was located.\n\n189\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.130\nEverything I deleted was inside there.\n\n190\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.292\nSo I'm going to find that\nelement in my actual markup.\n\n191\n00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:10.070\nI'm gonna locate it first,\nso it has a class, collapse.\n\n192\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.840\nAnd also the other class\nthat has is navbar collapse.\n\n193\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.860\nWe will find it right here.\n\n194\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.850\nHere we go, collapse, navbar collapse.\n\n195\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.780\nAnd then I'm gonna make it have only\nthe children that it has right now.\n\n196\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.580\nSo this ul that has the class nav,\n\n197\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.390\nnav bar nav, nav bar right,\nis the one that I want to keep.\n\n198\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.630\nI want to delete all the other children.\n\n199\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.870\nSo this ul right here,\nI'm going to delete it and make sure.\n\n200\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.400\nI have to zoom out a little bit to\nbe able to see this more properly.\n\n201\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.240\nHere we go.\n\n202\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.830\nSo you see, it matches up there\nwith the closing element.\n\n203\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.910\nSo I'm going to just yank\nit completely from here.\n\n204\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.545\nSave that the form.\n\n205\n00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:56.405\nI got rid of that too.\n\n206\n00:11:57.465 --> 00:11:58.875\nDelete that.\n\n207\n00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:02.475\nAnd then I believe this is\nthe one that I wanted to keep.\n\n208\n00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:05.695\nul nav, nav bar right,\nnav bar nav, nav bar right.\n\n209\n00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:11.165\nThat's the one, and I wanted to get\nrid of the drop-down that's in there.\n\n210\n00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:17.290\nSo now, I got rid of that, and\nmy code got a heck of a lot simpler.\n\n211\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.554\nAnd it's all about figuring out,\nif I wanna delete an element,\n\n212\n00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:22.851\nI really have to start at the opening tag,\nand\n\n213\n00:12:22.851 --> 00:12:26.136\nthen select all the way to\nthe closing tag, and then hit Delete.\n\n214\n00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:30.125\nAnd if I did it right it should work,\nand hopefully I did it right.\n\n215\n00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.159\nSo when I refresh, there we go.\n\n216\n00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:33.748\nSo I refresh my page, and\n\n217\n00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:38.380\nI actually have this structure that\nI rehearsed in the Developer Tools.\n\n218\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.272\nSo, let me separate a little bit,\n\n219\n00:12:44.272 --> 00:12:48.470\nmy nav from my container, to see what's\ngoing on, get our bearings here.\n\n220\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.680\nAnd let's say that I wanted to add\nadditional links to this page.\n\n221\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.950\nLet's say that I want to have a Home,\nStore, and About.\n\n222\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.020\nHow would I do that?\n\n223\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.040\nSimply, I would just replicate\nthis element that's a link.\n\n224\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.340\nCopy it there.\n\n225\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.710\nPaste it a few times.\n\n226\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.273\nThis one would be Home,\n\n227\n00:13:12.273 --> 00:13:16.165\nStore, and About.\n\n228\n00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:17.315\nNow, let's look at what's going on here.\n\n229\n00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:18.705\nWhy is that gonna work?\n\n230\n00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:24.445\nThe ul is the one that's creating that\nlittle horizontal navigation layout,\n\n231\n00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:26.515\nwhere each li is a possible link.\n\n232\n00:13:27.635 --> 00:13:29.545\nAnd what's inside each of those lis?\n\n233\n00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:32.577\nAn anchor element, and it has an href.\n\n234\n00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:37.732\nSo ideally once I have created\nseveral HTML files I would put\n\n235\n00:13:37.732 --> 00:13:43.312\nsomething like index.html here for\nthe Store, store.html.\n\n236\n00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:48.820\nAnd for About, about.html and\nthen my nav bar would work.\n\n237\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.490\nSo if I refresh this I have Home,\nStore and About.\n\n238\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.950\nAnd obviously,\nyou haven't created any of those files.\n\n239\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.800\nSo if I click on, well, I have the index,\nwell, I don't have anything else.\n\n240\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.420\nSo if I click on store,\nit's gonna tell me that wasn't found.\n\n241\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.800\nBut if you look, it actually\nwent to where I wanted it to go.\n\n242\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.980\nSo later on I can create the store file\nand then it will all come together.\n\n243\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.100\nBut when I click on Home,\nit just reloads the current page.\n\n244\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.030\nSo that one does work,\ncuz that file does exist.\n\n245\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.580\nNow with this,\nlet's see if there's anything we need to.\n\n246\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.910\nCuz honestly I don't remember [LAUGH]\nto make sure that our navigation bar is\n\n247\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.510\nresponsive.\n\n248\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:30.050\nHere we go,\nwhen we make our webpage mobile,\n\n249\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.000\nwe have this right here and\nnothing is popping up so\n\n250\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.346\nI need to figure out why\nit is that didn't come up.\n\n251\n00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:41.749\nSo let's go back to\nthe documentation right here.\n\n252\n00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:45.893\nAnd first of all, I'm gonna make sure\nthat this example that I have in\n\n253\n00:14:45.893 --> 00:14:48.760\nthe documentation, is actually responsive.\n\n254\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.295\nI have to find it.\n\n255\n00:14:56.766 --> 00:14:58.360\nAnd just scroll down.\n\n256\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.960\nIt's the next section, right here.\n\n257\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.470\nAnd when I click on here, it does come up.\n\n258\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.810\nSo now I need to figure out,\nI deleted something.\n\n259\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.299\nI deleted too much.\n\n260\n00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:12.156\nSo let me look up navbar\nhere we go okay so\n\n261\n00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:16.590\nI think it's in the navbar header.\n\n262\n00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:23.409\nSo this is my toggle [INAUDIBLE].\n\n263\n00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:27.973\nOkay, so these three spans right here,\nall they are they're little lines.\n\n264\n00:15:27.973 --> 00:15:33.314\nSo what that is is each of those spans\ncontains one of those little lines.\n\n265\n00:15:33.314 --> 00:15:38.638\nThen the button that's around it\nis the actual button that's there.\n\n266\n00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:44.520\nAnd It should toggle.\n\n267\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.659\nLet me figure out from the documentation\nwhat I can do to find out what elements\n\n268\n00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:50.450\nshould be toggled based on that.\n\n269\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.670\nHere and other content for toggling.\n\n270\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.398\nSo, I'm back here.\n\n271\n00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:02.977\nI made the mistake of thinking Because\nthere was so much stuff going on\n\n272\n00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:07.000\nin the nav bar that I deleted something\nthat I didn't need to delete.\n\n273\n00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.400\nAnd I didn't take my own advice and\n\n274\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.400\ngo into the console to\nfigure out what's wrong.\n\n275\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.890\nSo whenever something doesn't\nload the way that you want it to,\n\n276\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.490\nyour first step should\nbe check the console.\n\n277\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:23.210\nAnd right here it says\nBootstrap JavaScript requires jQuery.\n\n278\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.740\nAnd right there,\nit's in the Bootstrap JavaScript file, and\n\n279\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.260\nall I did is I forgot to\ninclude the jQuery file.\n\n280\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:36.230\njQuery is a JavaScript\nlibrary that pretty much\n\n281\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.980\ndoesn't really add anything to JavaScript,\nbut it just makes everything easier to do.\n\n282\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.430\nIt adds some things, too, but\n\n283\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.740\nfor the most part the way people use\nit is to make things way less verbose,\n\n284\n00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.400\nyour code is way shorter and\ncleaner looking, and more consistent.\n\n285\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.250\nCuz with plain JavaScript it's\na little bit inconsistent.\n\n286\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.790\nSome things are property,\nsome things are functions, and with jQuery\n\n287\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.930\neverything is a function so it's kind of\nintuitive to use once you're a programmer.\n\n288\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.450\nIt's much more intuitive to use.\n\n289\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.900\nSo what I need to do in\norder to fix this error and\n\n290\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.650\nto recap, the error was that when I was\nclicking on the hamburger icon button,\n\n291\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.620\nthe response navigation wasn't coming on.\n\n292\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.040\nI need to actually include that jQuery\nlibrary before the Bootstrap JavaScript.\n\n293\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.307\nSo I'm going to go to Google, or\n\n294\n00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:27.873\nyour search engine of choice,\nand type in jQuery CDN,\n\n295\n00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:33.094\nand the first link that comes\nup is a CDN for jQuery.\n\n296\n00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:33.892\nSo I can click,\n\n297\n00:17:33.892 --> 00:17:37.525\nit's very important that you actually\ndo not use the latest version.\n\n298\n00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:42.106\nYou can't use the 3.x,\nyou have to go back to jQuery 2.x and\n\n299\n00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:44.699\nI can click on this minified icon and\n\n300\n00:17:44.699 --> 00:17:49.550\nit gives me the script tag that I\nneed to copy and paste into my page.\n\n301\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.230\nSo I can select it like that and\nhit Ctrl+C or Cmd+C,\n\n302\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:57.385\nor I can just click on this little copy\nto clipboard icon, which is what I did.\n\n303\n00:17:57.385 --> 00:18:02.075\nAnd it's very important that I insert\nit after the Bootstrap JavaScript.\n\n304\n00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:03.885\nSo get to the end of that line.\n\n305\n00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.885\nHit Enter or actually before sorry.\n\n306\n00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.095\nBefore the Bootstrap JavaScript.\n\n307\n00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:11.570\nBecause if Bootstrap needs it,\nit needs to be loaded beforehand.\n\n308\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.550\nSo, paste it right here.\n\n309\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.290\nSo now I'm loading my Bootstrap\nstylesheet, and I'm loading the jQuery\n\n310\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.390\nCDN, now I'm loading the jQuery\nlibrary from the CDN.\n\n311\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.920\nNow I'm loading\nthe Bootstrap JavaScript from the CDN.\n\n312\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.940\nAnd now I should be good to go.\n\n313\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.660\nI'm just gonna close this tab,\nreload my page.\n\n314\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.380\nI no longer get the error.\n\n315\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.660\nSo if I resize my page,\nnow my responsive navigation should work.\n\n316\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.041\nAnd here we have Home, Store, and About.\n\n317\n00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:43.744\nAnd that's one of the coolest things that\nBootstrap has that it makes it really,\n\n318\n00:18:43.744 --> 00:18:46.425\nreally easy for\nyou to do that responsive navigation bar.\n\n319\n00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.044\nIt's the easiest one that I've seen.\n\n320\n00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:52.040\nI've used other frameworks where\npretty much every framework has that.\n\n321\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.271\nSo there's other frameworks\nlike Materialize, CSS,\n\n322\n00:18:55.271 --> 00:18:57.408\nMaterial Design Lite, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n323\n00:18:57.408 --> 00:19:01.696\nThey all have that, but for the most part,\nin every other case that I've seen,\n\n324\n00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:05.984\nonce you insert all the HTML that you need\nto insert, you link all the JavaScript\n\n325\n00:19:05.984 --> 00:19:10.208\nthat you need to link, you also need to\ncreate an additional script and copy and\n\n326\n00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:13.890\npaste a little line of JavaScript\ncode to initialize that.\n\n327\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.870\nAnd that can be a little bit daunting,\n\n328\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.580\nand it just introduces another point for\nhuman error.\n\n329\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.080\nSo now we have our response\nin the navigation bar.\n\n330\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.330\nThe next thing I'm going to do\nis I'm going to go to this and\n\n331\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.265\ngo back to Documentation.\n\n332\n00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:33.725\nAnd I'm gonna add a carousel,\nso like an image slider.\n\n333\n00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:35.865\nThat is located under\nthe JavaScript section.\n\n334\n00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:39.355\nLet me find it.\n\n335\n00:19:39.355 --> 00:19:40.755\nHere we go.\n\n336\n00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:44.500\nAnd kind of this is what's\nkinda gonna look like.\n\n337\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.380\nIt's going to have the little\ncontrols down there.\n\n338\n00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.440\nAnd that gray image there,\n\n339\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.960\nthat says Third slide, the letters Third\nslide are actually a part of the image.\n\n340\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.333\nSo, I'm going to grab the source code\nright here, And all the way to the end.\n\n341\n00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:05.990\nCopy it, get back to my page.\n\n342\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000\nAfter the navigation bar,\ninside the container and\n\n343\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.355\nbefore the row,\nthat's where I'm going to put it.\n\n344\n00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:17.594\nCuz this navigation bar is going to\nspan the entire width of the screen.\n\n345\n00:20:17.594 --> 00:20:20.211\nI don't know why I have this\nrendering issue all of a sudden.\n\n346\n00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:25.018\nBut anyway, so the navigation bar is gonna\nspan the entire width of the screen,\n\n347\n00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:27.665\nthat's what we want for the most part.\n\n348\n00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:30.955\nIf we don't want that,\nthen we can stick it inside a column, but\n\n349\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:32.675\nI don't really know why\nanybody would do that.\n\n350\n00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:37.144\nSo inside our container,\nI'm going to paste,\n\n351\n00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:40.718\nagain there's gonna be a lot of code so\n\n352\n00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:45.321\nI probably should comment here,\nend carousel.\n\n353\n00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:49.900\nAnd I'm gonna start selecting\nall the stuff that I pasted\n\n354\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.999\nall the way to the first line of it so\nI can indent it properly.\n\n355\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:21:00.460\nSo I have my navbar there, here we go.\n\n356\n00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.210\nSo this was the first line that I pasted.\n\n357\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.744\nAnd actually,\nthe carousel is pretty well commented.\n\n358\n00:21:08.744 --> 00:21:13.364\nYou can see right here it has this\ncomment that says indicators.\n\n359\n00:21:13.364 --> 00:21:20.700\nSo indicators right here are kind of\nthe little bubbles, that are down there.\n\n360\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.860\nAnd then here's where the magic happens,\nwhere it says wrapper for slides.\n\n361\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.110\nThis div right here is a wrapper for\nslides.\n\n362\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.460\nAnd for\nevery slide that you want to insert,\n\n363\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.940\nyou need to put in one of these items.\n\n364\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.730\nIt starts here and ends here.\n\n365\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.370\nSo basically, if we just look\nat that structure, we copy and\n\n366\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.140\npaste that structure and\nwe can insert a slide.\n\n367\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.041\nSo, that's what I'm going to do,\nI'm gonna expand my [INAUDIBLE] so\n\n368\n00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:44.660\nI can see my folder structure.\n\n369\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.046\nBefore the episode I went ahead and\ndownloaded three little slides here.\n\n370\n00:21:48.046 --> 00:21:53.160\nSo I'm just gonna modify this first slide,\nthe image of the first slide,\n\n371\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.810\nto its source attribute is gonna\ndetermine where it loads from so\n\n372\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.640\nI'm just gonna write in\nthe source attribute.\n\n373\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.745\nHey, HTML file, go into the IMG\n\n374\n00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:09.000\nfolder/slideone.JPEG and\nload the image from there.\n\n375\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.210\nAnd the image is I think\na girl an a computer.\n\n376\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.911\nSo alt=\"girl on computer\".\n\n377\n00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:21.780\nThen the carousel-caption is actually with\nsomething that we don't see in the sample,\n\n378\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.010\nbut it's a little bit of text that can\ncome up over the indicators right here.\n\n379\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:33.750\nAnd we can just write, let's write on\nh2 that says this is the first slide.\n\n380\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.990\nThen we move on to our next slide which,\nso\n\n381\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.680\neach div that has a class\nitem represents one slide and\n\n382\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.177\nyou need all that structure that's in\nhere to kind of have an additional slide.\n\n383\n00:22:48.177 --> 00:22:52.556\nSo for this one, we're gonna\nmodify the SRC attribute again and\n\n384\n00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:55.404\nwe're gonna say, img/slide2.jpg.\n\n385\n00:22:55.404 --> 00:22:58.077\nAnd the alt, also, girl on computer,\n\n386\n00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:03.198\nis just three pictures from different\nangles of the same girl on computer.\n\n387\n00:23:03.198 --> 00:23:10.880\nThe caption, h2, this is the second slide.\n\n388\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.280\nNow I'm just writing these captions,\nthese general captions so\n\n389\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.930\nthat you see what it's\ngonna look like in the end.\n\n390\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.570\nAll these ellipses that we have,\n\n391\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.910\nwe have to delete, cuz we don't want that\ncoming up, they're just dot, dot, dots.\n\n392\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.250\nThey're not actually part of HTML or\nanything, what they mean is, hey,\n\n393\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.280\nhere's where you would\nput your next thing.\n\n394\n00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.122\nSo now we added a third item.\n\n395\n00:23:30.122 --> 00:23:33.096\nWe're gonna change\nthe image to be slide3.jpg.\n\n396\n00:23:33.096 --> 00:23:37.640\nWe're gonna have carousel caption,\nand this is the third slide.\n\n397\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.030\nLet me see if there's\nany more dot-dot-dots.\n\n398\n00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.920\nThe controls right here are actually\nthe little arrows to the left and\n\n399\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.910\nright that you can use\nto navigate the slides.\n\n400\n00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:54.990\nAnd I think I'm done, so I'm just gonna\ngo and check out what I have here.\n\n401\n00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.330\nAnd here we go.\n\n402\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.740\nSo here's my carousel.\n\n403\n00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.749\nIt has the little controls.\n\n404\n00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:07.366\nIf I scroll down,\nit has the carousel caption.\n\n405\n00:24:07.366 --> 00:24:10.705\nIt has the indicators and\nI can click on it and\n\n406\n00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:13.720\nI keep going over and over and over.\n\n407\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.760\nSo, as you can see that\nwas not that hard at all.\n\n408\n00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.350\nIt's probably going to\nlittle bit more difficult,\n\n409\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.660\nyou're probably going to make a couple\nmistakes the first time you do it.\n\n410\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.660\nBut trust me, it's worth the learning\ncurve because when it comes to using\n\n411\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.320\nthe alternatives, so tools like the\ngraphical base, the WYSIWYG type editors\n\n412\n00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.030\nor the CMS tools that generate\na bunch of database-based content for\n\n413\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.170\nyou that stuff takes forever to tweak.\n\n414\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.220\nSo there'll be a little element that's\njust like, out of alignment and\n\n415\n00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.180\nit's just a nightmare.\n\n416\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.050\nIt can take you 20 hours to figure\nout what's going on with that,\n\n417\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.640\nas where as with Bootstrap you know\nexactly what you put in there.\n\n418\n00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.160\nYou know exactly what you have If\nsomething needs to be aligned.\n\n419\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.350\nYou can just go into the own style sheet\nthat you created and change it there.\n\n420\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:08.730\nOne little thing about the images,\nthe images that I selected are very tall.\n\n421\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.490\nYou probably don't wanna\nselect images like that.\n\n422\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:16.250\nI just really like these images and\nI couldn't find anything better.\n\n423\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:21.570\nBut if you are going to develop your\nown website, you probably wanna crop\n\n424\n00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.670\nsome area off the top of these images, and\nsome area off the bottom of these images.\n\n425\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.680\nSo that the slider's captions are not\noutside the fold of your page.\n\n426\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:37.370\nOne more thing, so, keeping that in mind\nthat you kinda want to have rectangular\n\n427\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:42.710\nimages if you make them too rectangular,\nif you make them too short and you try to\n\n428\n00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.850\nget content above the fold even with the\nslider you're gonna run into this issue\n\n429\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.500\nthat when you resize your page,\ncheck it out, you see?\n\n430\n00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.280\nEven though my slide is almost squared,\nit's already looking like\n\n431\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.900\nthe image is kind of small,\nit's looking kinda, out of proportion.\n\n432\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.890\nSo, imagine if your image\nwas half as tall as this\n\n433\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.790\nyour slide would look like a little\npiece of film kind of at the top of\n\n434\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.760\nthe screen-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.540\n>> And it would just not look right and\n\n436\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.100\nyou would probably have to have different\nimages for the responsive version of your\n\n437\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.938\ncarousel and that would be quite\na little bit more involved to setup.\n\n438\n00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:22.410\n>> Mm-hm very good, really amazing\nwhat you're able to do there with just\n\n439\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.700\nwithin our 30 minute episode,\ncame up with a pretty cool page there,\n\n440\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.890\nfull navigation bar,\nyou got your image slider there, and not\n\n441\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.290\nonly that you shrink it down to a mobile\ndevice size and it still looks great.\n\n442\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.880\nSo fantastic, really good example\nthere of how powerful and\n\n443\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.730\nhelpful Bootstrap can be when\nyou're developing those web pages.\n\n444\n00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.860\nSo we thank you, with that,\ngreat demonstrations there.\n\n445\n00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.730\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n446\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:22.315\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our HTML CSS and bootstrap.\n\n4\n00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:26.515\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be diving into the world of glyphs\n\n5\n00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:27.315\nand forms.\n\n6\n00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.755\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Victor Moreno.\n\n7\n00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:31.075\nHow are you doing, Victor?\n\n8\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:32.345\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Mike.\n\n9\n00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:37.240\nAnd what I'd like to do today is as\nyou said, talk about glyphs and forms.\n\n10\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.150\nGlyphs are those kinda like cute little\nicons that you see in so many websites.\n\n11\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.930\nUsually people fade them\nin as you scroll down.\n\n12\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.270\nWe're not gonna get to that that far,\nwe're not gonna get that far into,\n\n13\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.460\nwe're not gonna make them fade in,\n\n14\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.230\nbut we're gonna learn how to use all the\nglyphs that are built in with Bootstrap.\n\n15\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.430\nWe're gonna learn how to\nbuild form elements and\n\n16\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.290\nwe're going to apply all of this within\nthe context of a responsive grid.\n\n17\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.580\nAnd finally we're gonna talk\nabout what forms even are.\n\n18\n00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.390\nSo they're pretty much\n\n19\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.465\nthe original way in which HTML\ncan communicate with the servers,\n\n20\n00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.535\ntransmit data to a server or we're\ngonna go a little bit more into detail.\n\n21\n00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:18.405\nAnd that's why if you look at my screen\nnow, let's just remember where we\n\n22\n00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:22.845\nleft off in this little\nwebsite project that we have.\n\n23\n00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.825\nWe have a navigation bar\nat the top then right\n\n24\n00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.970\nbelow that navigation\nbar we have a container.\n\n25\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.800\nInside the container, we had a carousel,\nwhich is our image slider,\n\n26\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.600\nand the carousel ends right here.\n\n27\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.590\nAnd then we have an empty row right here,\nso what I'm going to do is inside there,\n\n28\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.550\nI'm going to create a responsive\ncolumn structure at two column layout.\n\n29\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.200\nAnd in order to do that, I'm just\ngoing to create a div with a class.\n\n30\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.020\nColumn XS 12, and\n\n31\n00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.870\nColumn Large 6.\n\n32\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.640\nAnd that's the way that I\ntype that is just because of\n\n33\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.980\na little add on that I have, so I just\nwanna throw that little hint in there.\n\n34\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.960\nI'm not gonna do it again,\nbut just so that you see.\n\n35\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.610\nYou can really really abbreviate\nthe way that you write mark up\n\n36\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.930\nwith the use of add ons\nthat come with Atom.\n\n37\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170\nThat one in particular was called Emmet.\n\n38\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.810\nIt's E-M-M-E-T.\n\n39\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.550\nAnd it's available for Sublime text,\nI believe, for brackets as well, and\n\n40\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.660\nfor Atom.\n\n41\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.590\nSo, we have our first div, right there.\n\n42\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760\nI'm just going to copy this structure and\npaste it down here.\n\n43\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.660\nAnd if you recall,\n\n44\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.620\nbecause there's no content right now,\nthey would be completely invisible.\n\n45\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.360\nNow, what I'm going to\ndo first is I'm going to\n\n46\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.880\ngo through to the Butra page\nunder the Components section.\n\n47\n00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.990\nThe first thing that you find is GLIFs and\n\n48\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.460\nhere are examples of all the little\nicons that you have available.\n\n49\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.080\nAll of this you can insert into your page.\n\n50\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.640\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that\nyou can use a little fire,\n\n51\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.010\nmagnets stuff like that.\n\n52\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.740\nThere's additional libraries in a future\nepisode we're actually going to be\n\n53\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.060\ngetting into.\n\n54\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.160\nAnd I recalled font awesome,\nas even more icons that you can use.\n\n55\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.930\nBut boot strap is good for\na fair amount of use cases,\n\n56\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.380\nwith the glifs that it comes with, and\nhere's an example of how to insert a glif.\n\n57\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.230\nJust with this span right here,\nif you have the class glif icon and\n\n58\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.450\nglif icon surge.\n\n59\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.359\nAnd by the way, because I haven't\nexplicitly mentioned this.\n\n60\n00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.910\nBy saying class equals and two separate\nthings, I'm just applying both classes.\n\n61\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.460\nSo whatever CSS rules are inside each\nof those classes are all applying\n\n62\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.950\nto the span element.\n\n63\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.610\nThe area hidden attribute they\nmention up here in the documentation,\n\n64\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.070\nthat is so\nthat screen readers ignore this.\n\n65\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.540\nSo screen readers, or\n\n66\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.660\nthe programs that visually impaired\npeople use to interpret the web, and\n\n67\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.470\nbecause glif icons are actual fonts,\nscreen readers tend to have a hard time.\n\n68\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.920\nThey tend to get confused\nby these elements.\n\n69\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.820\n&gt;&gt; So, with the area hidden true\nattribute, we're telling screen readers\n\n70\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.300\nhey, forget about this thing,\n&gt;&gt; Is just like kind of visual sugar,\n\n71\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.400\ndo not read this out to\nthe person you're trying to help.\n\n72\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.840\nYou don't want them trying to\npronounce one of those glyphs [LAUGH].\n\n73\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly so I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert that into my column right here,\n\n74\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.760\nand I'm going to insert another one right\nhere and let's look at what I have so far.\n\n75\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.690\nLet's see if that worked.\n\n76\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.720\nMaybe I need to insert\nanother style sheet.\n\n77\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.140\nDepending on, here we go.\n\n78\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.905\nSo the little magnifying glass\nthat you see right there.\n\n79\n00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n80\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.110\n&gt;&gt; At the very bottom of the screen,\nthat is the glyph icon.\n\n81\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.260\n&gt;&gt; So in order to make that\na little bit better looking,\n\n82\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.970\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going\nto add padding above this row.\n\n83\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.590\nSo, I'm going to just give it\nanother class, top padding.\n\n84\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.630\nAnd now I need to go through the setup cuz\nthis is the first time that I'm actually\n\n85\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.180\nadding custom styling to this page.\n\n86\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.480\nI need to go through the setup of adding\na custom and additional stylesheet here.\n\n87\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.410\nSo I'm going to scroll\nall the way to the top,\n\n88\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.730\nafter the meta tag I'm going to create a\nlink that's of a relationship stylesheet.\n\n89\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.300\nAnd the reference of it is going\nto be inside my CSS folder.\n\n90\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.120\nAnd the conventional name is style.css.\n\n91\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.151\nNow actually have to create that\nfile in here, so right-click,\n\n92\n00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:31.740\nnew file, style.css and\n\n93\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.040\nthen I have to Create the CSS class\nthat I promised I was gonna create.\n\n94\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.600\nBut I've already forgotten the name.\n\n95\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.430\nAnd that's one of the things that's gonna\ntrip you up a lot in the beginning.\n\n96\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.070\nYou're gonna create a new class here or\na new ID there.\n\n97\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.890\nAnd then you're gonna have to go back and\n\n98\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.410\ntry to remember what the class\nname was that you created.\n\n99\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.390\nI'm usually pretty good about it.\n\n100\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.040\nBut I remember in the beginning, man,\nI would just write class whatever and\n\n101\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.230\nthen go to my style sheet and\nhave to go back to see what it was.\n\n102\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.470\nSo for top padding, actually yeah,\nI'm gonna leave it called top padding.\n\n103\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.469\nLet's see,\nsometimes it's better to use margins and\n\n104\n00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.955\nsometimes it's better to use padding.\n\n105\n00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:11.686\nLet's see how the padding works.\n\n106\n00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:15.881\nPadding top let's say 30 pixels and\n\n107\n00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:21.300\nlet's see what that looks like and\nthere we go.\n\n108\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.510\nSo now let me zoom out so\n\n109\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.340\nnow our little magnifying glasses\nare separate from the top.\n\n110\n00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.120\nBut what if don't want magnifying glasses?\n\n111\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.850\nThat's where these actually\nlittle classes I have here.\n\n112\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.450\nHere we go.\n\n113\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.840\nThese little classes that I\nhave in this span Search.\n\n114\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.840\nThat's the one that's determining\nwhich actual little icon shows up.\n\n115\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo in order to change that one, because\nof the thing that I'm going to have in\n\n116\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.600\nthat column, I'm gonna have a paragraph\nthat says here at ITProTV and\n\n117\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.825\nat FBI, we have got to catch them all.\n\n118\n00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.428\n[LAUGH] This is a Pokemon reference.\n\n119\n00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:05.147\n&gt;&gt; That's very good.\n\n120\n00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:11.066\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to copy\nthat a couple of times So\n\n121\n00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:15.010\nthat they have a slightly\nmore substantive paragraph.\n\n122\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.310\nAnd when I look, I know there's a glyph\nthat looks a little bit like Pokeball, so\n\n123\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.590\nI'm gonna pick that one.\n\n124\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.500\nLet's see.\n\n125\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.520\nWhere are you.\n\n126\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.064\nThere's an I right there.\n\n127\n00:07:27.377 --> 00:07:28.460\nHere we go.\n\n128\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.390\nCliff icon adjust, and\nas you know like that usually the icon for\n\n129\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.893\nadjusting the contrast in a monitor but\nI'm wanna pretend it's a pokeball.\n\n130\n00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:38.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click icon adjust,\n\n131\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.911\nlet me change both that cuz I probably\ngonna delete the second gif icon later\n\n132\n00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:47.835\n&gt;&gt; And now let's look.\n\n133\n00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:52.291\nRefresh, now we have\nboth of our Pokeballs.\n\n134\n00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:56.234\nNow, I'm gonna get into a little\nbit more advanced tiling.\n\n135\n00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:59.538\nSo remember when we talked about\nstyling by class, styling by ID, and\n\n136\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:00.552\nstyling by element.\n\n137\n00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:05.060\nWe had set that that's the 20%\nyou need to know to get 80% done.\n\n138\n00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.140\nBut what is drawback of having to create a\nclass every time you want to do something?\n\n139\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.530\nYou end up with elements that say\nclass glyph icon, glyph icon adjust.\n\n140\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.916\nWhatever, a larger font size.\n\n141\n00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:19.499\nWhite font, all these different things\nthat you've created classes for\n\n142\n00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.240\nend up being applied to all of them.\n\n143\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.750\nAnd that's not something that you want.\n\n144\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.430\nSo if I want to style a specific element\nwithout really adding a class to it.\n\n145\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:34.243\nOne thing I can do is kind of\nlook at its Its nested structure.\n\n146\n00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:39.001\nAnd maybe I wanna style the glyph\nicon that's inside our call SS12,\n\n147\n00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:42.328\nthat's in our row so\nthat's something I can do.\n\n148\n00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:46.340\nLet me see..\n\n149\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.080\nIn this paragraph.\n\n150\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.886\nSo to this div,\nI'm going to give an ID, here.\n\n151\n00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:55.438\nAnd that way I'm going to be able to refer\nto paragraphs that are inside that ID,\n\n152\n00:08:55.438 --> 00:08:59.217\nglyph icons that are inside that ID, and\nmultiple elements that are inside that ID.\n\n153\n00:08:59.217 --> 00:09:04.277\nI'm going to be able to target them and\nnot get out, and not target\n\n154\n00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:09.813\nevery single span or every single\nglyph icon on the page ID, first row.\n\n155\n00:09:09.813 --> 00:09:15.375\nSo then my styles I can create, and so\nhow do we actually create that selector?\n\n156\n00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:19.360\n#first-row, remember the hashtag is to\nsignal that there's going to be an id,\n\n157\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.500\nthat the following thing is going to be an\nid, and then I can say Class glyph icon.\n\n158\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.420\nSo, first row,\nspace.glyphicon means, hey HTML, for\n\n159\n00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:38.310\nany glyph icon that's inside an element\nwith ID first row, you apply these styles.\n\n160\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.471\nAnd what styles I'm going to apply,\nfonts, size, like I said,\n\n161\n00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:49.710\nglyph icons are fonts so I can put 4\nRAM there and let's see how that looks.\n\n162\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.750\nSo another, that's too little,\nlet me put 8 RAM, there we go.\n\n163\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.430\nThat's too big but\nwe're gonna leave it that way.\n\n164\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.630\nAnd now I want to center the text so\n\n165\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.880\nI basically want to center\nthe contents of this div.\n\n166\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.890\nSo I'm just going to create\nanother style rule that says,\n\n167\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:18.090\nfor First row,\nthe element where ID first row,\n\n168\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:23.320\nany div inside of it is going\nto have text-align center.\n\n169\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.060\nAnd let's see if that's enough,\nif it has what we need.\n\n170\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:33.520\nThere we go, so now both the text of the\nparagraph and the glyph icon are centered.\n\n171\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.160\nBecause I said that the any\ndiv that's inside the element\n\n172\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.170\nwith ID first row should have its contents\ncentered so that's what that did.\n\n173\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.100\n&gt;&gt; That really saves you a lot in your\ncoding you do it once instead of multiple\n\n174\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.520\ntimes for each item.\n\n175\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.834\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly so now everything that\nI have inside first row is going to be\n\n176\n00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:56.384\ncentered and I could honestly it's just\nthat I'm building this on the fly.\n\n177\n00:10:56.384 --> 00:11:00.415\nI don't know what the theme is gonna be,\nor how it's gonna come out in the end, but\n\n178\n00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:05.000\nI could have probably said, any div that's\ninside a row, has text align centered.\n\n179\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.990\nAnd that's probably a pretty safe thing\nto do because justified left text doesn't\n\n180\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.180\nalways look great,\nespecially in multiple column layouts.\n\n181\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.250\nOkay, so we have that right here,\nwe have our two column layout.\n\n182\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.380\nNow what I wanna do is just\nreplace this glyph icon, and\n\n183\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.190\nnow is when we're going\nto get into the forms.\n\n184\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.220\nBut actually before we get into the forms,\nlet's recap the glyph icon.\n\n185\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.930\nGlyph icons are fonts.\n\n186\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.320\nHow you add them is you pretty much go and\ncopy the example that they have, which\n\n187\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.790\nis down here below the actual icons, all\nthe actual little pictures of the icons.\n\n188\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.740\nAnd then all you have to do\nis change glyphicon-search\n\n189\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.100\nto whichever one of\nthese up here you want.\n\n190\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.120\nSo it could be glyph icon-\nice- lolly- tasted and\n\n191\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.930\nthere will be like a half\nbitten ice lollipop and\n\n192\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.620\nglyph icon- education would\nbe like that little hat and\n\n193\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.030\nso on and so forth so it's pretty\neasy to use they look really nice\n\n194\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.870\nDoesn't matter how far you scale them how\nlarge you scale them they're always gonna\n\n195\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.960\nlook crisp cuz they are a font they're\nnot an actual image and they load fast.\n\n196\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.400\nOkay so now let's get into those forms.\n\n197\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.090\nSo just go to the other section of\nthe documentation which is under\n\n198\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:28.530\nCSS you can find in the right hand side\nyou have like a little scroll spy.\n\n199\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.860\nThat's what that thing a little element\nis called and we can click on forms.\n\n200\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.022\nSo this very first example is kinda of\n\n201\n00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:40.710\nlike 98% of the time\nwhat you're gonna need.\n\n202\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.990\nAnd it says,\n\n203\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.340\nas far as creating a nice looking form\nlayout it's pretty much the way to go.\n\n204\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.300\nBut it has a lot going on that\nwe're gonna have to explain.\n\n205\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.930\nFirst of all\n\n206\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.660\nlet's take a look how there's a form\nelement that we haven't seen before.\n\n207\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.490\nSo what are forms, they are how you\nkind of communicate data to the server.\n\n208\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.780\nSo any time that you want to\nsubmit an email to the owner of\n\n209\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.790\na website you want to,\n\n210\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.230\nback in the day they were really the only\nway to communicate data with a server.\n\n211\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.560\nSo you wanted to buy something,\nit was done with a form.\n\n212\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.120\nYou wanted to ask the website to send\nan email, it was done with a form.\n\n213\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.890\nAnything that you wanted to communicate\nwith the server was done with a form.\n\n214\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.810\nNowadays there's other ways, but\nforms are still pretty well used.\n\n215\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.150\nAnytime you register for a site,\nit asks you for a username or a password,\n\n216\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.175\nyou type them in, you're using a form.\n\n217\n00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:35.405\nAnytime that you go on somebody's\nwebsite and you click, contact us,\n\n218\n00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:37.525\nyou're using a form, and so on.\n\n219\n00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:44.275\nSo in order to have these\ntypes of form inputs,\n\n220\n00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:48.345\nlike this text boxes, or the little\nradio buttons, or the little check\n\n221\n00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:53.590\nbox buttons that you have sometimes, they\nshould always be inside of form elements.\n\n222\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.738\nSo I'm going to actually build\nthis form little by little.\n\n223\n00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:58.898\nI'm just gonna start with\nthe form element itself and\n\n224\n00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:02.020\nI'm gonna put it inside this\nstructure that I have, so\n\n225\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.840\ninside the second column that's\nwhere I'm gonna put my form.\n\n226\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.037\nSo form, I'm gonna close it right there.\n\n227\n00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:12.894\nAnd then I'm going to look at what's going\non with the Bootstrap documentation, so\n\n228\n00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.860\ninside the form I have all of these divs.\n\n229\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.020\nThey'll say class, form, group and\nthat's just kinda how Bootstrap works.\n\n230\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.310\nYour forms are gonna look a little bit\nweird and not right if you don't do this.\n\n231\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.360\nSo, for\neach input that you have in your forms,\n\n232\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.160\nyou wanna have a date class form group.\n\n233\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.100\nAnd inside of it,\nthat's where you're gonna have your input,\n\n234\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.180\nright next to your input,\nyou're gonna have your label.\n\n235\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.600\nThe label, so, let's see how this looks.\n\n236\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.400\nThis code right here corresponds\nto this example right here.\n\n237\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.060\nSo, email address,\nyou see, that's the label.\n\n238\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.070\nEmail address is right here.\n\n239\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.130\nAnd, the actual input where you\ntype the text Is right here.\n\n240\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:58.170\nSo, that text box,\nthat's called an input of type email.\n\n241\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.590\nThere's a bunch of types of input.\n\n242\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.920\nBut before I get into that,\n\n243\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.480\nlet me talk about a little bit\nmore what's going on here.\n\n244\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.780\nThe label has this four attribute,\nyou see that?\n\n245\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.190\nThe four attribute relates what you\nwant to put in there is the ID of\n\n246\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.190\nthe input who that label belongs to.\n\n247\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.370\nSo you see this input has an ID\nexample they put input email 1 and\n\n248\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.790\nthe label says for\nexample input email one.\n\n249\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.870\n&gt;&gt; So it's really associating\nthat label with that text box?\n\n250\n00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n251\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.580\nAnd that's something that you want\nto do to be semantically correct.\n\n252\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.530\nNow let's see what else is\ngoing on to this input.\n\n253\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.490\nInput type email.\n\n254\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.198\nType email specifies what's gonna\ngo in here is an email address.\n\n255\n00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:46.029\nClass form control,\nthat's formatting stuff.\n\n256\n00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.588\nIt's a class that comes from Bootstrap and\nit's gonna make it look nicer.\n\n257\n00:15:49.588 --> 00:15:51.663\nAs long as it's inside a form group,\nit's gonna look correct.\n\n258\n00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:54.875\nAnd then the placeholder\nis what text you want to\n\n259\n00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:59.500\nshow up there when it's empty in\nthe middle of the email input text.\n\n260\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:05.687\nSo let's go ahead and grab this markup and\nsee how it looks on our page.\n\n261\n00:16:05.687 --> 00:16:09.000\nActually, before the form,\n\n262\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.513\nI'm going to say that this is H1, H3.\n\n263\n00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:15.138\nSmaller.\n\n264\n00:16:15.138 --> 00:16:16.532\nContact us.\n\n265\n00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:21.540\nInside here, paste that.\n\n266\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.570\nNotice that my indentation\nis all messed up.\n\n267\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.300\nUsually, the first line you\npaste the indentation's correct.\n\n268\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.220\nThe rest is not.\n\n269\n00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:33.130\nSo, gonna select the rest of the lines,\nhit tab until it's right.\n\n270\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:33.718\nNow it's right.\n\n271\n00:16:33.718 --> 00:16:37.924\nThe label and the input is indented\nwith respect to the outside div and\n\n272\n00:16:37.924 --> 00:16:40.890\nI I should have something\nto show right now.\n\n273\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.780\nSo let's go to the page,\nI deleted the glyph icon,\n\n274\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.190\nI have H3 that says Contact Us, and\nit says email address here, and email.\n\n275\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.530\nNotice that mine is centered,\nwhereas theirs is not.\n\n276\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.491\nAnd the reason for\n\n277\n00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:58.269\nthat is cuz of that CSS rule that I\nadded right here that said that any div\n\n278\n00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:03.088\nthat's inside first row is gonna have\nits contents aligned to the center.\n\n279\n00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:07.050\nI'm not necessarily in love\nwith the way that looks, but\n\n280\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.790\nit's not that bad so\nI'm gonna leave it that way.\n\n281\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.720\n&gt;&gt; If you wanted to fix that,\nwould you just make an ID for that\n\n282\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.330\none column there that said, okay, ignore\nthe rule we said and let's left align it?\n\n283\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.697\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could do that.\n\n284\n00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:21.997\nYou could make that first\nrule more specific.\n\n285\n00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:25.400\nSo if I made that first\nrule more specific,\n\n286\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.958\njust put right here,\nmove that first row id for example.\n\n287\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:30.919\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n288\n00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.991\n&gt;&gt; I mean go ahead and\ndo that right here and then just,\n\n289\n00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:41.375\nactually I should call it first row call,\nit's the first row and first column.\n\n290\n00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.270\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow this thing is gonna be more specific,\n\n292\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.130\nthere's no longer dips\ninside their first row call.\n\n293\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.768\nI broke the font sizing.\n\n294\n00:17:53.768 --> 00:17:54.386\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n295\n00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.971\n&gt;&gt; But because I renamed this but\n\n296\n00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:01.425\nall I gotta do is change that to call and\nthere we go.\n\n297\n00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:04.690\nSo the font sizing is back, the centering\nis here, this is not centered,\n\n298\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.420\nthis is not centered, and so\nthis looks a little bit more natural now.\n\n299\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.238\nAnd our inputs are looking good.\n\n300\n00:18:11.238 --> 00:18:13.760\nAutomatically Bootstrap does this for you.\n\n301\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.040\nWhen I click it,\nit lights up in blue around.\n\n302\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.340\nSo it's a nice little subtle effect.\n\n303\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.780\nGood design is all about subtlety.\n\n304\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.630\nYou don't wanna go all crazy with crazy\ncontrasts, crazy background colors.\n\n305\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.295\nSubtle is usually when in doubt\ngo subtler than you think.\n\n306\n00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Then let's say, what do I want to add?\n\n308\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.120\nI have an email.\n\n309\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.440\nI just want to add full name.\n\n310\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.518\nSo I'm just going to copy that div,\nclass, form, group, right?\n\n311\n00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:49.300\nIt's gonna auto-close for me and\nthen inside there, label for full name,\n\n312\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.060\nfull name,\nthe other one doesn't have a colon so\n\n313\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.450\nI shouldn't put colons on this one,\nand then I have my input type= text.\n\n314\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.240\nSo this is another type of input,\nit's the most basic type of text input.\n\n315\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.443\nIt doesn't try to enforce it,\nit doesn't allow it to enforce anything.\n\n316\n00:19:07.443 --> 00:19:12.483\nIf you have for example, input type TEL,\nT-E-L, that's gonna be a telephone,\n\n317\n00:19:12.483 --> 00:19:17.307\nand some cell phones are gonna know that\nwhen a user taps on an input of that type,\n\n318\n00:19:17.307 --> 00:19:21.699\nthey should only get a numeric key pad\ncuz if the input is for a telephone,\n\n319\n00:19:21.699 --> 00:19:24.050\nit makes no sense to type any letters.\n\n320\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:30.670\nSo input type text and I still need\nto apply the class form group,\n\n321\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:36.390\nI don't need an ID and, yeah, I do need\nan ID to associate with the label,\n\n322\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:43.710\nID full_name and\nI think that's it for now.\n\n323\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.750\nThe placeholder.\n\n324\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.588\nSo I need a placeholder.\n\n325\n00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:52.714\nFull name.\n\n326\n00:19:52.714 --> 00:19:57.472\nSo now let's go look at\nwhat I have in my page.\n\n327\n00:19:57.472 --> 00:19:58.780\nIf I refresh.\n\n328\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.695\nHere we go.\nI did something wrong.\n\n329\n00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:02.540\nCuz that does not look right.\n\n330\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.630\nSo let's see I have the form group.\n\n331\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.260\nForm control.\n\n332\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.040\nSo this class right here?\n\n333\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.130\nI typed the wrong form group.\n\n334\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.535\nIt's for the div that surrounds\nthe label and the input.\n\n335\n00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The actual input should have form\n\n336\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.058\ncontrol.\n\n337\n00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:21.090\nAs the class, there we go.\n\n338\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.620\nSo now we're looking correct.\n\n339\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n340\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.110\n&gt;&gt; And I think that's gonna\nbe just full name and email.\n\n341\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.030\nWe're gonna get back to you over email,\nright?\n\n342\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We don't care what you wanna know,\n\n343\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.935\nwe just ask you for it, right?\n\n344\n00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:35.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no message here.\n\n345\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.230\nActually, you know what,\n\n346\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:41.310\nI'm going to include a message because\nthat's gonna give me the opportunity to\n\n347\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.880\ntalk about another pretty important\nform element, which is the text area.\n\n348\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.300\nSo these inputs are single\nline text inputs,\n\n349\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.640\nsometimes you want a larger text input and\nthat's where the text area comes in.\n\n350\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.180\nLet me go and see if there's\nan example text area somewhere and\n\n351\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.200\nif not, let me just Ctrl+F text area,\nhere we go.\n\n352\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.525\nAnd let me just see their\nexample is pretty simple.\n\n353\n00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:11.269\nI think it’s not gonna look right\nif I don’t do the div thing,\n\n354\n00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.223\nbut let me try like that anyway.\n\n355\n00:21:13.223 --> 00:21:15.592\nLet's see what that looks like.\n\n356\n00:21:15.592 --> 00:21:17.337\nTry to break something before you fix it.\n\n357\n00:21:17.337 --> 00:21:21.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, looks right.\n\n358\n00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:25.459\nLet’s see if I just include a label\nright here, how that'll look.\n\n359\n00:21:25.459 --> 00:21:29.922\nLabel For whom.\n\n360\n00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:34.777\nThe text area doesn't have an ID so\nI'm just gonna call it TXT area and\n\n361\n00:21:34.777 --> 00:21:38.560\nthen give this guy an actual ID attribute,\nTXT area.\n\n362\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.094\nThey will forward TXT area.\n\n363\n00:21:45.068 --> 00:21:46.103\nI got to close this.\n\n364\n00:21:46.103 --> 00:21:50.542\nAnd inside the content of the label,\nyour message.\n\n365\n00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:54.830\nSo let's see what we have now.\n\n366\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.630\nHere we go.\nIt all looks good.\n\n367\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.440\nThe text area doesn't really need\n\n368\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.770\nto be surrounded by the div\nwith the class form group.\n\n369\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.340\nSo we're looking pretty\ngood with our form.\n\n370\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.800\nLet's test the responsiveness of our site.\n\n371\n00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.930\nIt's looking good.\n\n372\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.150\nThe first column stacks\non top on of the form.\n\n373\n00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.260\nAnd now, we're gonna get to the buttons.\n\n374\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.040\nSo in order to add a form button,\nwe scroll to this\n\n375\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.200\nsection right here and Bootstrap actually\nhas a bunch of very nice looking buttons.\n\n376\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.450\nThese right here are the plain ones.\n\n377\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.880\nAnd here it tells you what you need to\ndo in order to add one of these buttons.\n\n378\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.930\nIf you just give the class BTN and\n\n379\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.660\nthe two classes BTN and\nBTN default to any element of these types,\n\n380\n00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.510\na button, or input,\nthey're gonna look like these.\n\n381\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.400\nIf you add BTN, BTN primary,\nit's gonna look blue, like this.\n\n382\n00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.880\nBTN, BTN success is gonna look green.\n\n383\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.381\nBTN, BTN influence is gonna look blue,\nlike light blue.\n\n384\n00:22:57.381 --> 00:23:00.580\nBTN, BTM warning is gonna look yellow and\nso on.\n\n385\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.070\nI want to add this primary one.\n\n386\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.396\nSo I'm just gonna copy this right here.\n\n387\n00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:11.685\nButton type, here we go.\n\n388\n00:23:11.685 --> 00:23:14.943\nAnd after the text area is\nwhere I'm going to paste it.\n\n389\n00:23:14.943 --> 00:23:20.320\nSo it says button type=\"button\",\nI'm gonna change it in a second.\n\n390\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.920\nAnd the class btn btn-primary.\n\n391\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.235\nInstead of primary we're just going\nto write here Send us your message.\n\n392\n00:23:30.875 --> 00:23:33.540\nJust get back to the page and\nsee what that looks like.\n\n393\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.698\nHere we go, send us your message.\n\n394\n00:23:36.698 --> 00:23:45.329\nI could add a little bit of padding to\nthe top there, so let me give an ID.\n\n395\n00:23:45.329 --> 00:23:50.314\nID = submit We're not padding this.\n\n396\n00:23:50.314 --> 00:23:51.982\nPadding would make it larger so\n\n397\n00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:55.145\nI wanna add margin to it to\nseparate it from that text box.\n\n398\n00:23:55.145 --> 00:24:00.060\nOr, I'm gonna try and\nsee if this fixes it.\n\n399\n00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.470\nPutting the text box inside\na form group might fix it.\n\n400\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.820\nIt's a lot of stuff to bootstrap.\n\n401\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.720\nYou're never gonna know all of it, so\n\n402\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.610\nsometimes you just need a little bit\nof good old-fashioned trial and error.\n\n403\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.000\nSee right here, and that did fix it.\n\n404\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.340\nSo there's your reason to put\nin your div class form group.\n\n405\n00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.240\nSo we have your button right here,\nwe have your send us your message.\n\n406\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.580\nClicking it is doing nothing, and\n\n407\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.540\nnow we're gonna talk about\nhow forms are built to work.\n\n408\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.000\nThe second that your web\nbrowser sees a form element.\n\n409\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.120\nIt's going to look at all the inputs.\n\n410\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.040\nAll the things inside of it.\n\n411\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.740\nAnd it's going to look for\none of two things.\n\n412\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.209\nInput type submit, or button type submit.\n\n413\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.864\nThe second it sees one of those its\nbasically going to automatically add in\n\n414\n00:24:46.864 --> 00:24:49.875\na behavior that when the user clicks\nthat button it's going to try\n\n415\n00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:52.249\nto grab everything that's\nwritten into the form.\n\n416\n00:24:52.249 --> 00:24:55.562\nCompose it into an internal\nformat that it has for data and\n\n417\n00:24:55.562 --> 00:24:59.140\nsend it to wherever the form\nsays it needs to be sent.\n\n418\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.940\nRight now we haven't configured\nour form to go anywhere.\n\n419\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.012\nHow we do that is by going to\nour form element right here and\n\n420\n00:25:06.012 --> 00:25:11.560\nsaying action=, and\nwhere do we want the form to get sent to.\n\n421\n00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.885\nFor the most part it\nwill be some PHP file so\n\n422\n00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:21.304\nlet's just say Send email by PHP.\n\n423\n00:25:21.304 --> 00:25:25.142\nI build my forms in OAS usually but\nI know this is like still, for\n\n424\n00:25:25.142 --> 00:25:28.320\nlike 90% of people the way that it's done.\n\n425\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.106\nSo your form action is going to send email\nby PHP and that would necessitate that\n\n426\n00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:37.905\nyou have a send email.PHP file located\nin that same path as your index.html.\n\n427\n00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:40.214\nAnd that your web server\nhas PHP installed and\n\n428\n00:25:40.214 --> 00:25:43.790\nthere's a couple of things that\nyou need in order to do set up.\n\n429\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.580\nAlso obviously in the send email PHP file\n\n430\n00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.090\nyou need to have code that's\nactually capable of sending email.\n\n431\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.190\nAnd the other thing, so\nI need two more things to make this form,\n\n432\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.980\nwell I would need three more things\nto make this one functional.\n\n433\n00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.510\nNumber 1, the sending email PHP code,\n\n434\n00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.140\nwhich is a little bit outside the scope\nof this, so I'm not gonna have that.\n\n435\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.340\nWe'll leave that to the programmer\nif we're just doing HTML/CSS.\n\n436\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.470\nThere will probably be a guy to do the\ncoding, or you could probably Google it.\n\n437\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.430\nThere's a thousand\ntrillion samples of them.\n\n438\n00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.610\nOr use whatever other search\nengine of your choice.\n\n439\n00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.590\nSo that's the number\none thing that I need.\n\n440\n00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:21.619\nNumber two is I need to change\nthis button type to Submit, so\n\n441\n00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:26.648\nthat the browser picks it up\nautomatically as a thing that is\n\n442\n00:26:26.648 --> 00:26:33.507\ngoing to send the data of this form to\nwherever the form action say it's located.\n\n443\n00:26:33.507 --> 00:26:35.640\nSo I lied,\nthere's two more things that I need.\n\n444\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.370\nI need a method equals post, right here.\n\n445\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.520\nAnd this refers to the type of request\nI'm going to send when this form gets\n\n446\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.700\nsubmitted.\n\n447\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.151\nFor the most part,\n\n448\n00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:50.900\nyou want your forms to get submitted\nto create an HTTP POST request.\n\n449\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.040\nBecause POST is a request that's built for\nsending larger amounts of data.\n\n450\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.330\nIf you have a GET request,\nit's not built to send as much data.\n\n451\n00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.510\nPUT, DELETE and OPTIONS request\nare not built for this at all.\n\n452\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.700\nReally the name of the game with\nforms is having a post request, and\n\n453\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.210\nthe last thing that I need is\n\n454\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:14.010\nhow does my data that's written\ninside my form get labeled and sent?\n\n455\n00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.690\nIn order to instruct my form as\nto how that's going to happen,\n\n456\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.890\nI need name attributes for all my inputs.\n\n457\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.521\nSo if I have name equals right here.\n\n458\n00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:31.324\nFull name, then the form is going\nto know that is going to kind\n\n459\n00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:36.370\nof send a bit of data, title,\nfull name, and the value of that\n\n460\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:41.600\ndata is going to be whatever is\nwritten inside of the input.\n\n461\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.226\nSo let's say that I write\n\n462\n00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:50.650\nhere Napoleon X right?\n\n463\n00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:55.444\nWhen the user clicks the button and the\nbrowser is figuring out how to send this\n\n464\n00:27:55.444 --> 00:28:00.704\nform, it's going to create a name for this\nit's called a variable in programming.\n\n465\n00:28:00.704 --> 00:28:04.398\nIt's gonna create a name for\nthis Napoleon X bit of data, and\n\n466\n00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:07.170\nthe name is going to be\nfour underscore name.\n\n467\n00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.040\nUsually it's good practice to have\nthe same name as what you have for\n\n468\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.280\nID for each input,\nthat way you save yourself confusion.\n\n469\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.948\nSo for the input type e-mail,\nI'm going to have,\n\n470\n00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.220\nI'm gonna change that idea actually\ncuz that's a pretty long gross ID.\n\n471\n00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.680\nID is going to be e-mail, and\nthe name is also gonna be e-mail.\n\n472\n00:28:30.671 --> 00:28:33.850\n&gt;&gt; And then that's what your coders\nwould use in the PHP script.\n\n473\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; To say, okay whatever data come back\n\n474\n00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.730\nthat's labeled email, we know to put that\nin the database labeled email column.\n\n475\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.380\nAnd full name is gonna go in\nthis column in the database, or\n\n476\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.770\nwhatever the case maybe.\n\n477\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.920\nAbsolutely right,\nthat's exactly the point.\n\n478\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.630\nWhat you're doing is setting up how the\ndata is gonna come label to the server so\n\n479\n00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.960\nthat when the server program runs,\nexactly as you said,\n\n480\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.600\nwhatever data came in under the email,\nI'm gonna do something with it.\n\n481\n00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.530\nWhatever the data came in\nunder the name message,\n\n482\n00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.530\nI'm gonna do something else with it.\n\n483\n00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.010\nMaybe that's gonna be the subject\nof my email or what have you and\n\n484\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:07.150\nwhatever data came under the label\nfull_name maybe I'll send it.\n\n485\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.550\nI'll do something else, maybe I'll send\nit to a database or what have you.\n\n486\n00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.190\nSo the last thing that we need to\ndo right here is for the text area.\n\n487\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:20.130\nSo we'll also give it a name,\nname txt_area.\n\n488\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.610\nAnd so right here for this ID, I should\nprobably change that to an underscore.\n\n489\n00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:32.008\nIt's not a great idea to\nhave input names with minus\n\n490\n00:29:32.008 --> 00:29:37.115\nsigns because in programming,\na minus sign is for subtraction.\n\n491\n00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:39.260\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So that can create some problems or\n\n492\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.590\nsome confusion\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n493\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.080\nthat's why I changed that name right here.\n\n494\n00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.590\nSo I have names for all my input fields.\n\n495\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.130\nI have my button type Submit.\n\n496\n00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.640\nI have my form action where is it gonna\nget submitted to the method that is\n\n497\n00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.270\ngoing to get submitted under.\n\n498\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:56.033\nAnd if I do this I should get a wonderful\nerror cuz I don't actually have\n\n499\n00:29:56.033 --> 00:29:57.665\nthat sendemail.php.\n\n500\n00:29:57.665 --> 00:30:02.332\nBut we can see that the behavior of when\nthe user clicks the button submit it\n\n501\n00:30:02.332 --> 00:30:04.910\nactually did try to go there.\n\n502\n00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.540\nYou see, it did try to go to\nthe send email PHP script,\n\n503\n00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.490\nit's just that we don't\nhave that available.\n\n504\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n505\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.690\n&gt;&gt; So to recap what we did today,\n\n506\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:19.545\nwe basically incorporated a new\nresponsive section to our little website.\n\n507\n00:30:20.705 --> 00:30:22.215\nWe talked about the glyph icons.\n\n508\n00:30:22.215 --> 00:30:25.165\nWe demonstrated how they're fonts,\nhow you can resize them.\n\n509\n00:30:25.165 --> 00:30:27.835\nIf you wanted to color them, I didn't\nmention this, but if you wanted to color\n\n510\n00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:31.545\nthem, you would just use the regular color\nattribute, which changes text color.\n\n511\n00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:34.035\nAnd we demonstrated a bunch\nof different form elements,\n\n512\n00:30:34.035 --> 00:30:39.490\nand built a form into one of\nthe columns of our little dummy site.\n\n513\n00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.650\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Victor.\n\n514\n00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.240\nAgain great demonstrations there and\n\n515\n00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.860\ngreat explanations of how we\ncan use those from boot straps.\n\n516\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.220\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n517\n00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.240\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n518\n00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.970\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n519\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:52.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm Victor Moreno.\n\n520\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.280\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:22.230\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our HTML CSS and Bootstrap.\n\n4\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.380\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at Font awesome.\n\n5\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.790\nI have no idea what that is.\n\n6\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.380\nBut that's why we got the expert,\nMr. Victor Moreno.\n\n7\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.510\nHow you doing, Victor?\n\n8\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.670\n>> I'm doing great, thank you very\nmuch Mike and you're absolutely right,\n\n9\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.850\nfont awesome is awesome.\n\n10\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.436\nIt's not just a name.\n\n11\n00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:45.521\nAnd what it is, is kind of a little set\nof icons that are embedded into a font.\n\n12\n00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.420\nThey're vector icons.\n\n13\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110\nVector graphics basically means that\ninstead of being an image that's\n\n14\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.170\ndefined pixel by pixel,\nlike traditional old school images,\n\n15\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.940\nthey're defined in terms\nof little curves and lines.\n\n16\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.390\nSo, they're fully scalable and they never\nlose their sharpness, their resolution.\n\n17\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.020\nAnd that's what Font Awesome basically is.\n\n18\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.920\n>> Very cool.\n\n19\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.290\n>> The way that we incorporate it\ninto our already existing website\n\n20\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.170\nis by linking a style sheet, and\nthe reason why we wanna do that\n\n21\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.880\nis because they have such\na gigantic selection of icons.\n\n22\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.630\nSo I'm going to go to my\nsearch engine of choice and\n\n23\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.340\nI'm going to search for fontawesome in\na single word like that, and here we go.\n\n24\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130\nI never remember the website for\nsome reason.\n\n25\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.620\nIt's, I believe, fontawesome.io.\n\n26\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.650\nSo, yep.\n\n27\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.620\nThis is the one.\n\n28\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.050\nSo as always, we have the option of either\ndownloading it or linking it from the cdn.\n\n29\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.260\nWhat I'm going to do right now for\n\n30\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.370\nthe sake of brevity is\nto link it from the cdn.\n\n31\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.300\nAnd to do that I'm going to go\nto the Get Started section.\n\n32\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.420\nSo hopefully you guys\nare starting to see a pattern.\n\n33\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.260\nIt's usually whenever you want\nto use one of these tools,\n\n34\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.570\nyou go to the website,\nyou go to Get Started and\n\n35\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960\nthen you have download links and\nyou have CDN links right there.\n\n36\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.960\nCheck it out.\n\n37\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.302\nThey added, no, I thought that\nthey were making me sign up.\n\n38\n00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:09.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here we go.\n\n39\n00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.730\nTo use the CSS, all I need is this.\n\n40\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.880\nNo, yeah, they are making me sign up.\n\n41\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.370\nThat's interesting, all right.\n\n42\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.257\nSo let me go back to the homepage and\nsee if I downloaded.\n\n43\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.170\nAll right, it'll be good because that\nway we'll see the process of actually\n\n44\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.890\ndownloading a style sheet and\nincorporating it into our projects folder.\n\n45\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.240\nNo, thanks.\n\n46\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240\nI just wanna download it.\n\n47\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240\nSo it comes into a zip file.\n\n48\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.430\nI'm going to download it to\nthe root folder of my project.\n\n49\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.390\nAnd it's going to be zipped right there.\n\n50\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.990\nThat's when it says finished.\n\n51\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.920\nI'm going to show it in its folder,\nhere we go.\n\n52\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.860\nWhat I like to do, I don't know, everybody\nlikes to do this a different way,\n\n53\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.070\nI hit Ctrl+N to open a new window.\n\n54\n00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.510\nAnd I go in there.\n\n55\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.690\nI have the Font Awesome folder.\n\n56\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.610\nAnd I just need to get the stuff\ninside the CSS folder.\n\n57\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.377\nAnd get that Font Awesome min CSS,\ndrag it into my CSS folder, and\n\n58\n00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:11.277\nthen I get out of there,\nI get into the fonts folder and\n\n59\n00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:18.510\njust drag that whole thing,\nRight into my projects folder.\n\n60\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.810\nNow that I have the CSS stylesheet and\nthe actual font material,\n\n61\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.360\nI can just delete that zip\nfile because I don't need it.\n\n62\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.273\n>> Easy enough.\n\n63\n00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:30.707\n>> Hopefully, everybody thinks so.\n\n64\n00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:32.719\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that I have that style\n\n65\n00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.620\nsheet incorporated in my project folder,\nwhat I need to do is create a link to it.\n\n66\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.040\nSo this is getting relatively\nheavy with links but\n\n67\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.940\nthis is really nothing compared to what\nyou can get with some big websites.\n\n68\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.830\nI like to insert this,\nanything, any kind of library,\n\n69\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.710\nany kind of third party resource\nthat I use, I like to bring it in\n\n70\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.100\nbefore my own personal style sheet because\nthe order of style sheets matters.\n\n71\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.600\nActually, let's say there\nis a class called E3.\n\n72\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.537\nIn a couple of the different style sheets,\nthe class that the style sheet that\n\n73\n00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:13.310\ncomes after in the order, those are the\nrules that are gonna get applied to E3.\n\n74\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.186\nSo if there's conflicts with\nthe class naming convention,\n\n75\n00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:20.700\nthe latter style sheet is\ngoing to take precedence.\n\n76\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.310\n>> So you like to put your\npersonal ones last then, so\n\n77\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.200\nthat you've got a chance to override any\nof theres if there's a conflict in names.\n\n78\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.700\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthat's basically the way it is.\n\n79\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.640\nAnd it can really lead to some\nunexpected behavior if you have\n\n80\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.150\nyour own personal style sheet\nfirst cuz then you're thinking,\n\n81\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.950\nwhy is my container not doing\nwhat I think it should be doing?\n\n82\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.210\n>> But little known to you, they've got\nthe same class in one of their style\n\n83\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.080\nsheets that's overriding your efforts.\n\n84\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.960\n>> Absolutely, and so just rules of thumb,\n\n85\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.260\nto simplify this whole learning\ncurve of this whole thing,\n\n86\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.040\nrules of thumb that are very useful,\nso put your own style sheet last.\n\n87\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.712\nSo now we're going to insert\nthat font awesome style sheet,\n\n88\n00:05:00.712 --> 00:05:02.656\nso link rel=\"stylesheet\".\n\n89\n00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.346\nAnd again,\nwhen you're starting out with this,\n\n90\n00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:09.252\nyou're gonna have to either kind of be\nsavvy enough to look at another one\n\n91\n00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:13.371\nof your links or go to Google if you\ndon't remember how to link a style sheet.\n\n92\n00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:15.535\nHref =\n\n93\n00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:26.361\nCSS/font-awesome.min.CSS.\n\n94\n00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:28.093\nAnd I'm reading it off of here.\n\n95\n00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.210\nThat's how I figured it out.\n\n96\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.011\nBy the way,\nwhen you a see with that file.min thing,\n\n97\n00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.700\nwhat that means is that\nthe file has been minified.\n\n98\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.085\nSo if we look at it,\nthe entire file is just one long line,\n\n99\n00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:45.262\nit has the fewest amount\nof space possible.\n\n100\n00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:48.932\nThey have the headers but\nthe actual styles are one long, long line.\n\n101\n00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.280\nYou see all of this?\n\n102\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.760\nSo the reason they do that is to\npretty much save space, by having\n\n103\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.720\nthe least amount possible of spacing and\nenters and no line characters and\n\n104\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.780\nwhat have you, you can actually go\nfrom having 150 kilobyte JavaScript or\n\n105\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.740\nCSS file down to 60 kilobytes.\n\n106\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.936\nSo-\n>> Just by removing your carriage returns,\n\n107\n00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:10.119\nor your line returns, wow.\n\n108\n00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.010\n>> Mm-hm,\ncuz you're moving additional space.\n\n109\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.180\nSo it's not only the carriage returns,\nlet's look at my style sheet right here.\n\n110\n00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.392\nSo we're removing the carriage returns,\nwe're removing the additional tabs here,\n\n111\n00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:22.680\nso additional tabs,\nadditional carriage returns, tabs, tabs,\n\n112\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.650\nthe spacing between these\ntwo can be removed as well.\n\n113\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.550\nSo it's a lot of additional pading and\n\n114\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.170\nthings that you only really need for\nhuman legibility to remove.\n\n115\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.680\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n116\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.620\nsometimes it's just not good to have,\nespecially if you're using a third party\n\n117\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.220\nlibrary that you don't really wanna\ngo into, you don't really wanna edit.\n\n118\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.840\nYou wanna download that minified one so\nthat your website runs faster.\n\n119\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.890\n>> Very cool.\n>> So\n\n120\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.260\nnow that we've incorporated\nour Font Awesome style sheet,\n\n121\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.500\nI'm going to look for one of their\nexamples right here under Examples.\n\n122\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.670\nTheir documentation is pretty easy.\n\n123\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.950\nThe Bootstrap glyph icons used to use the\nspan element, there is actually an element\n\n124\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.600\nfor icons, which is the I element and that\nwhat Font Awesome encourages you to use.\n\n125\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.950\nSo here's an example, right here.\n\n126\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.479\nLet's include that somewhere in our\nlittle page and see what that looks like.\n\n127\n00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.192\nSee if we linked Font Awesome correctly,\nand we did everything we needed to do.\n\n128\n00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:27.818\nSo I'm going to put it in the column\nwhere I have those paragraphs and\n\n129\n00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:29.616\nsee what that looks like.\n\n130\n00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.970\nSo let's go back to my page,\nand here we go.\n\n131\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.260\nSo we have that tiny little\ncamera icon right there.\n\n132\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.080\nFont Awesome was the one\nthat gave us that.\n\n133\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:46.500\nSo what we can do now is figure\nout which icon we actually want.\n\n134\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.852\nActually, the most common use case for\n\n135\n00:07:48.852 --> 00:07:51.636\nFont Awesome is to insert\nsocial media icons.\n\n136\n00:07:51.636 --> 00:07:53.151\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\n\n137\n00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.734\nwe're gonna enter social media icons\ninto our navigation bar here at the top.\n\n138\n00:07:56.734 --> 00:08:01.226\nWe're just gonna put A couple\nof social media icons there.\n\n139\n00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:03.860\nSo let's see.\n\n140\n00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.620\nLet's go back to the top,\nthen go to icons.\n\n141\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.640\nThey added this cool navigation.\n\n142\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.950\nI just gonna go to all icons and\nthen search for.\n\n143\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:21.590\nThe big social media platform\nwhose name rhymes with Smashbook\n\n144\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.062\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:25.718\n>> And here we go.\n\n146\n00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:29.749\nSo in order to, we can click it, and\nright here it gives us an example.\n\n147\n00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:33.080\nSo these are all the sizing that all that\nwe have to do is change the font size in\n\n148\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.140\norder to get those different sizes.\n\n149\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.480\nAnd if I inspect it, actually, no.\n\n150\n00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.330\nFont also actually has a class\nto add additional sizes.\n\n151\n00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.880\nSo check it out.\n\n152\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.139\nIf I inspect this one,\nI can see that by adding the FA-5 class,\n\n153\n00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:49.620\nthat enlarges the font awesome element.\n\n154\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.300\nSo I am going to grab this\nicon example right here.\n\n155\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.590\nRemove the one that I had.\n\n156\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:04.010\nAnd add the FA- let's say 4,\n\n157\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.170\nit's autocompleting 4x.\n\n158\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.800\nSo I'm gonna try both, maybe the style\n\n159\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.415\nsheet that I downloaded is different\nfrom the one that they use themselves.\n\n160\n00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:18.870\nFA-4 did not work, so let's try FA-4x,\nlet's see, there we go.\n\n161\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.331\nSo it's as simple as that to change\nthe size of your Facebook icon.\n\n162\n00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:26.071\nNow we have it right there, but\nI didn't want it there right,\n\n163\n00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.558\nI wanted it in my navigation bar.\n\n164\n00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:31.856\nSo I'm gonna take it out of here and\ngo scroll up to my navigation bar, and\n\n165\n00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:36.438\nsometimes if you don't want to read\nthrough so much text, I can just remember\n\n166\n00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:41.190\nthat one of these links the rest of\nthe href Of store.html, for example.\n\n167\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.639\nAnd we'll Control-F to find store.html.\n\n168\n00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:47.360\nNow, I have it right there.\n\n169\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.610\nAnd all I need to do is add,\nI'm gonna add it at the beginning.\n\n170\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.300\nBecause this navigation bar,\nyou see the order it's in.\n\n171\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.620\nHome, Store, About.\n\n172\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.500\nHome store about.\n\n173\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.710\nSo if I want my social media icons to\nshow here, I would put them before.\n\n174\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.390\nSo a list item and\n\n175\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.028\nI want the formatting to be consistent so\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n176\n00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:12.540\nA href = We'll leave that blank for now.\n\n177\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.610\nAnd then inside the anchor element,\nthat's where I'm gonna put my icon.\n\n178\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.147\nSo my icon is really gonna\nbe the text of the link, so\n\n179\n00:10:20.147 --> 00:10:24.185\nwhen I click on the icon it's gonna go to\nwhere that h-ref says that it should go.\n\n180\n00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:27.145\nWhich would be,\n\n181\n00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:36.506\nhttp://www.facebook.com/yourpage.\n\n182\n00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:39.670\nSo let's go ahead and preview,\nand there we have it.\n\n183\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.380\nIt's too large right now, but\ndo not despair, we can easily fix that.\n\n184\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.540\nWe just have to change the 4X.\n\n185\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.700\nLet's try 2X and see what that looks like.\n\n186\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.790\nAnd that looks all right.\n\n187\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.290\nPerfect.\n\n188\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.930\nSo it has a the hover effects,\nit changes color when you hover it.\n\n189\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.690\nIf I click it, it does try to take me\nthere, but that's not an actual page,\n\n190\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.480\nso it lands somewhere else.\n\n191\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.990\nNow, we can go ahead and\n\n192\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.960\nadd another social media icon just for\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n193\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.450\nSo I'm going to hit Back and\ngo to the listing of icons and\n\n194\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.380\nsearch for the other big one.\n\n195\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.660\nOr the other big one that's\nnot by the same people.\n\n196\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.530\nClick on this.\n\n197\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.340\nHere we go.\n\n198\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.510\nHere's my icon sample, and actually you\nknow, what I probably should copy this\n\n199\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.150\nwhole structure right here and\nit will be easier.\n\n200\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.860\nSo now I need to look instead of this\nclass, what I need to have is this class.\n\n201\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.220\nSo grab that class.\n\n202\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.220\n>> Really, everything else is the same so.\n\n203\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.380\n>> Exactly.\nEverything else is the same.\n\n204\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.630\nWell, except the href.\n\n205\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.130\n>> Right.\n\n206\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.650\n>> Of the link.\n\n207\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.600\nEverything else is the same.\n\n208\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.187\nSo now I need to change\nthe href of the link.\n\n209\n00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:58.590\nAnd that's pretty much all I need for\nsocial media icons.\n\n210\n00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.790\nYou can just keep going then with\nwhichever ones you want, and\n\n211\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.780\nyou can see that that looks\npretty awesome and it's set up.\n\n212\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.680\nAnd as opposed to hunting around a search\nengine for a nice looking image and\n\n213\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.260\nthen you know you're not\ngonna have the hover effects.\n\n214\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.530\n>> Right.\n>> So this is way simpler and\n\n215\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.340\nway easier when it comes\nto stuff like that.\n\n216\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.470\n>> Fantastic.\n\n217\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.500\n>> Okay so, well we've discussed\na fair bit about Font Awesome.\n\n218\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.510\nYou can insert those\nicons wherever you like.\n\n219\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.510\nAgain, icons behave like fonts.\n\n220\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.190\nSo, if you wanna change their color, or\nyou wanna change their size, all you need\n\n221\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.090\nto do is change the color property,\nor change the font size property.\n\n222\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.380\nSo, now we're gonna talk a little but\nabout some more advanced css selectors.\n\n223\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:41.670\nSo, we alluded to this a little\nbit earlier in a previous lesson\n\n224\n00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.770\nwhen we did this.\n\n225\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.480\nNo, this one.\n\n226\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.360\nSo we send to any element\nwith the glyphIcon\n\n227\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.920\nclass anywhere inside first roll-call,\nso that's what this space means,\n\n228\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.140\nanywhere inside this one you're going to\napply any rules in between the braces.\n\n229\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.200\nBut there's other CSS\nrules that you can create,\n\n230\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.700\nand actually I'm going to use those\nlittle icons to demonstrate them.\n\n231\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.140\nSo I'm going to give\nthem both different IDs.\n\n232\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:15.120\nTo this A, I'm going to give it ID.\n\n233\n00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.570\nLet's say icon one and to this one\nI'm going to give it ID, icon two.\n\n234\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.450\nSo save that and one of the foremost\n\n235\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.830\nvery useful thing that you can do\nis if I want to start icon one and\n\n236\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.750\nicon two with the same style,\nthen I put a comma instead of space.\n\n237\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.500\nIf I don't put a comma\nthen it's looking for\n\n238\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.920\nan element with ID icon two inside\nan element with ID icon one.\n\n239\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.940\nCommas are what separates\none selector from another.\n\n240\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.695\nAnd I could theoretically have a rule\nthat's gigantic that has like Ps\n\n241\n00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:55.810\n,and the body element itself,\nand H1s, and H2s, and H3s,\n\n242\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:02.572\nand apply everything between the braces\nto all these types of elements.\n\n243\n00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:07.590\nSo there's really no limit to how many\nselectors you can include to a CSS rule.\n\n244\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:14.848\nWhat I want to do right now, is see how\nthese look in a little bit darker grey.\n\n245\n00:14:14.848 --> 00:14:22.280\nSo, color, RGB 50, 50, 50.\n\n246\n00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.210\nAnd let's see what that looks like.\n\n247\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.326\nSo look like a little bit dark gray\n>> [CROSSTALK] Dark gray.\n\n248\n00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:32.490\n>> But now, you see now we\ncan't see the hover effects.\n\n249\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.760\nSo how do we fix that?\n\n250\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.700\nWell, pretty simple.\n\n251\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.300\nJust go ahead and to those to\nparticular IDs, hashtag icon one,\n\n252\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.200\nthis is another new type of CSS selector,\nonly when its in the state hovered,\n\n253\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.730\nand also to icon two,\nonly when its in the state hovered, and\n\n254\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.810\nhovered means that\nthe mouse is on top of it.\n\n255\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:58.700\nWe're going to give it a color of,\nlet's just say zero, zero, zero.\n\n256\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.910\nHow many do I have there?\n\n257\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.730\n246, okay that's fine.\n\n258\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.510\nSo that's completely pitch black.\n\n259\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:12.000\nSo now there's that subtle thing there\nthat iy changes a little bit to black.\n\n260\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.800\nAnd again, the name of the game\nwith design is subtlety.\n\n261\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.860\nAnother thing that I can\ndo here is just very,\n\n262\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.700\nvery subtly just enlarge that\nicon when I mouse over it.\n\n263\n00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.420\nSo in order to enlarge things,\nrotate them, tilt them,\n\n264\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.150\nskew them, all of this stems from the same\nCSS rule that's called transform.\n\n265\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.280\nSo there's a CSS rule called transform,\nand\n\n266\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.990\nI encourage you, so look,\nlook how many options it has.\n\n267\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.701\nMatrix, matrix3D, perspective, rotate.\n\n268\n00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:48.756\nAnd right now Adam is letting me down for\nthis, come back here.\n\n269\n00:15:48.756 --> 00:15:53.099\nSo look, rotate x only,\nrotate y only, rotate z,\n\n270\n00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:57.860\nscale, scale3D, scale x,\nscale y, scale z, skew.\n\n271\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.535\nSkew basically like,\nMakes it like tilt it like that.\n\n272\n00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.194\nScale enlarges it.\n\n273\n00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:06.090\nSo if you wanna scale only on x,\nit will stretch it.\n\n274\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.570\nVery rare that I find a use for that.\n\n275\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.660\nScale y, it will stretch it this way.\n\n276\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:16.530\nScale z, it will actually stretch\nit in the axis of the viewer,\n\n277\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.130\nso that a lot of times it doesn't\nreally look like anything's happening.\n\n278\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.030\nTranslate is to move.\n\n279\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.140\nSo, translate is one of the more useful\nones because it allows you to control\n\n280\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.080\nwhere your element sits with\nrespect to its containing elements.\n\n281\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.090\nBut what we're gonna do right now is we're\ngonna just have a simple scale rule.\n\n282\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.350\nScale.\n\n283\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.100\nAnd if we use scale, as opposed to scale\nx or scale y, we have to pass two values.\n\n284\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.990\nHow to scale on the x axis and\nhow to scale on the y axis.\n\n285\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.722\nSo, for the width, we're gonna put 1.03,\nand for the height, 1.03.\n\n286\n00:16:46.722 --> 00:16:50.080\nAnd there's the end of our rule.\n\n287\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.210\nSo now, if we refresh,\nwhen we hover it That is almost too soft.\n\n288\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.260\nPut 1.08, and 1.08.\n\n289\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:05.310\nAnd I'm gonna enlarge my screen when,\nso now when we hover it you see?\n\n290\n00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.683\n>> Yes.\n>> It scales up a little bit.\n\n291\n00:17:07.683 --> 00:17:12.170\nBut that snappiness, I don't like it.\n\n292\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.000\nThat snappiness is not something, I don't\nlike it when you take an action and\n\n293\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.110\nit just, pop, pop, pop!\n\n294\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:18.450\nSnapping like that.\n\n295\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.700\nHow do we fix that?\n\n296\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.377\nWell, there is,\nfortunately there's a very simple and\n\n297\n00:17:22.377 --> 00:17:25.580\neasy-to-do thing with CSS\nthat's called transitions.\n\n298\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.660\nAnd what a transition basically does\nwhen there's a transition applied to\n\n299\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:34.550\nan element, any time any of its properties\nchanges, whether it be color, scaling,\n\n300\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:39.110\nrotation, underlining, anything, instead\nof snapping like what we were just seeing,\n\n301\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.720\nit will interpolate and\nslowly transition to its new thing.\n\n302\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.260\nSo, the transition has to be applied as\n\n303\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.440\nsoon the element is loaded in order for\nit to work.\n\n304\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.070\nSo I would apply it here.\n\n305\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.350\nAnd here I can say transition.\n\n306\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.560\nAnd the way the transition rule\nworks is first I have to say\n\n307\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.630\nwhich properties should have\ntransitions applied to them.\n\n308\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.900\nFor most part, I just go with all.\n\n309\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.090\nSo, all.\n\n310\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.830\nAnd the next thing is how long do\nI want the transition to take?\n\n311\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.470\nSo, let's put 1s for 1 second\n>> And that should be good.\n\n312\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.000\nSo now we should have\ntransitions right here.\n\n313\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.860\nSo, if I enlarge this, you see, it grows.\n\n314\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.760\nInstead of snapping, it grows.\n\n315\n00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.180\nAnd it's that subtlety again.\n\n316\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.400\nSo, that's much more subtle\nthan an element that snaps.\n\n317\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.150\n>> Yes.\n>> That snaps outward.\n\n318\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.155\nIf I wanted to make this more specific,\nI could change this to\n\n319\n00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:34.901\ninstead of it applying to all things,\nit could apply to transform only.\n\n320\n00:18:37.347 --> 00:18:38.510\nFor example.\n\n321\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.550\nAnd then, if we reload we're gonna\nsee that the color snaps and\n\n322\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.010\nthe transform doesn't.\n\n323\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:51.520\nSo the color changes instantaneously, and\nthe actual scaling of the element doesn't.\n\n324\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.670\nBut I don't really like that.\n\n325\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.790\nI'm gonna go back to all.\n\n326\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.470\nOne more thing we can do worth transitions\nis specify the transition curve.\n\n327\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:06.400\nSo, by default, it kinda starts off first,\nand slows down.\n\n328\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.960\nIf I want it to start slow, get fast,\nand slow down after, I would do,\n\n329\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:17.200\nI would specify the transition style,\nease in out.\n\n330\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.590\nAnd let's see.\n\n331\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.960\nSo, again, the difference between\nthis stuff is really subtle.\n\n332\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:29.330\nBut before, it was starting a little\nbit faster than it is starting now.\n\n333\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.760\nOkay, so\nwe've covered some advanced selectors.\n\n334\n00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.830\nWe've covered the hover,\n\n335\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.440\nso this selector that only applies\ndepending on the state hovered.\n\n336\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.670\nThere's another selector that I'm\ngonna demonstrate right now, but\n\n337\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.410\nI'm gonna take off that's called Active.\n\n338\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.150\nIt's similar to hover, and\nit only works when the element is clicked.\n\n339\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.550\nSo if I wanna say that icon one,\n\n340\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:56.080\nwhen it's active, when it's clicked,\nit can be color white,\n\n341\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.672\nthen what that'll accomplish is\nthat when I click, which one again?\n\n342\n00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:04.320\n>> Yep, Facebook, I think.\n\n343\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.148\n>> But it actually goes.\n\n344\n00:20:05.148 --> 00:20:05.963\n>> Yeah.\n\n345\n00:20:05.963 --> 00:20:09.635\n[LAUGH]\n>> So that's not gonna work.\n\n346\n00:20:09.635 --> 00:20:17.690\nLet's change that to be\nwhen I click on the nav.\n\n347\n00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.250\nWhen I click on the nav,\nthe color, just for\n\n348\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.190\nthe sake of demonstration,\nshould be purple.\n\n349\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.890\nAnd I see that works.\n\n350\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.440\nSometimes this rule is\na little bit tricky.\n\n351\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.190\nIt likes to work better, yeah.\n\n352\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.740\nIt depends on the way that\nyour elements flow right now.\n\n353\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.110\nMaybe I'm not clicking on the nav.\n\n354\n00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.790\nMaybe that div that's inside\nthe nav is taking precedence, and\n\n355\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.290\nthat's the one that's\nreceiving the click event.\n\n356\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.570\nSo it takes a little bit of trial and\nerror, but\n\n357\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.523\nhopefully you guys can take my word for\nit that this is a thing.\n\n358\n00:20:43.523 --> 00:20:49.042\nAnd also nav, when I write ICON1,\nit's not coming\n\n359\n00:20:49.042 --> 00:20:54.770\nup right now, but\nit came up a second ago with the.\n\n360\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.210\nThere we go, active.\n\n361\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.550\nSo it is a thing it's there in Atom.\n\n362\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.430\nSo some more advanced CSS selectors.\n\n363\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:08.500\nIf you want an element that's\nimmediately inside another\n\n364\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.494\nelement, because what we talked\nabout with the example was\n\n365\n00:21:13.494 --> 00:21:19.445\nthat glyph icon is not necessarily\nimmediately inside this one.\n\n366\n00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:22.650\nThat glyph icon can be\nnested 27 levels inside\n\n367\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.830\nthe element with first role call ID and\nit will still get this style.\n\n368\n00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.390\nBut if we want to apply a style only to\nan element of a particular kind that's\n\n369\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.215\nimmediately inside another one,\nso as in this case, for\n\n370\n00:21:35.215 --> 00:21:39.698\nexample, you can say class <nav>, right?\n\n371\n00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:43.346\nClass <nav>.\n\n372\n00:21:43.346 --> 00:21:48.153\nImmediately inside <nav>,\nwe're looking for an <li>, </li><li>,\n\n373\n00:21:48.153 --> 00:21:50.911\nand immediately inside the </li><li>,\n\n374\n00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:54.885\n</li></nav></nav></nav> We're looking for\nan A.\n\n375\n00:21:54.885 --> 00:21:59.723\nAnd immediately inside that,\nwe're looking for an icon.\n\n376\n00:21:59.723 --> 00:22:03.096\nThen here we can say color purple.\n\n377\n00:22:03.096 --> 00:22:07.055\nAnd that should apply to\nour social media icons.\n\n378\n00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:10.740\nSo we can follow, this is really,\nreally specific right now.\n\n379\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.771\nSo this is getting really, really specific\nas you're following like the documents,\n\n380\n00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:17.790\nthe tree-like structure\nas you laid it out.\n\n381\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.800\nSo, that's useful sometimes, depending-\n>> Cuz you might have\n\n382\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.670\nother list items that happen to be nested\ninside some of those same elements.\n\n383\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.270\nBut not exactly the same, and\nyou don't want it to effect those.\n\n384\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.330\nSo, you're saying, look, only if it's\ninside this, which is inside this,\n\n385\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.140\nwhich is inside this, which is inside\nthis do you get this purple color.\n\n386\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.880\n>> Exactly.\n\n387\n00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.420\nSo, if we had stopped at this level, for\n\n388\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.440\nexample, then the rule might apply only to\nevery single thing in the navigation bar.\n\n389\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.680\nAnd maybe we don't want our actual home\nstore and about links to be purple.\n\n390\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.539\nMaybe we only want the social\nmedia icons to be purple.\n\n391\n00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.470\nSo let mem just take that off right now.\n\n392\n00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.530\nAnother thing, another way,\nanother selector,\n\n393\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.350\nanother way that I can get my\nselector to be more specific\n\n394\n00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.350\nis by specifying multiple\nthings about the same element.\n\n395\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:05.650\nSo let's say that I want to select, I want\nto do something to this ul right here, and\n\n396\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.610\nthere's a ton of ul's in the page.\n\n397\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.350\nI don't really wanna\nbother by adding an ID or\n\n398\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.440\nfiguring out if they share a class or not.\n\n399\n00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.890\nSo what I can do is just copy\nall the classes that it has.\n\n400\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.230\nAnd here I can style it by saying ul dot,\nand then let me see.\n\n401\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:33.330\nYeah, nav is the class, so\nnav.navbarnav.navbar right.\n\n402\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.200\nSo that means, that's basically\ntelling the document, hey, HTML page,\n\n403\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.470\ngo and find me a ul that has a class\nnav and also has the class navbar.nav.\n\n404\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.090\nAnd also has the class navbar-right.\n\n405\n00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.143\n,by separating all these classes\nwith dots and no spaces,\n\n406\n00:23:48.143 --> 00:23:50.290\nyou're referring to the same elements.\n\n407\n00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.170\nAnd finally, the last thing.\n\n408\n00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:59.910\nIf I want to be, I mean IDs are already\npretty specific cause IDs are unique, but\n\n409\n00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:05.010\nif for some reason you wanted to\nrefer an element by its ID and\n\n410\n00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:10.750\nits type, you could do,\nlet me find an element that has an ID.\n\n411\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.360\nID equals here.\n\n412\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.220\nSo, bs-example.\n\n413\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.150\nThis is a div that has the id\nbs-example-navbar-collapse-1.\n\n414\n00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:26.434\nSo, if I wanted to target that div\nmore specifically, I could do div, and\n\n415\n00:24:26.434 --> 00:24:31.689\nwithout space, lower case div.\n\n416\n00:24:31.689 --> 00:24:36.460\nAnd so, just like the example\nthat we went through before,\n\n417\n00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.070\nby not having spaces I'm\nreferring to the same element.\n\n418\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:43.270\nI'm adding more specificity to\nthe same selector, to the selector for\n\n419\n00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:43.920\nthe same elements.\n\n420\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.140\nSo in here, I'm looking for a div that\nhas this ID as opposed to looking for\n\n421\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.550\nthis ID inside that div, which is\nwhat happens when I put that space.\n\n422\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.900\n>> Very cool.\nAll right, Victor,\n\n423\n00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.025\nit's another great set of examples there.\n\n424\n00:24:57.025 --> 00:25:00.510\nA really good to look at what we can\ndo with font awesome first of all.\n\n425\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.140\nGreat collection of icons,\nremember they're vector, or they're fonts.\n\n426\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.060\nSo, like vectors, they scale well.\n\n427\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.710\nWe can treat them just like we can a font,\nresize them, recolor them.\n\n428\n00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.600\nAnd then, a really good look at some of\nthe advanced CSS techniques we can use to\n\n429\n00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.500\nreally drill down and\n\n430\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.250\nmake you very specific with way\nwe apply that CSS to our HTML.\n\n431\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.330\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n432\n00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.220\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n433\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.710\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n434\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.500\n>> And I'm Victor Moreno.\n\n435\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.285\n>> And we'll see you next
