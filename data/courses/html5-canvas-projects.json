So this course is to really submit\nsome of the skills maybe you've acquired\n\n6\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.350\nthrough HTML5 canvas.\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.700\nI know what the canvas element is,\nI know the 2D rendering context,\n\n8\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.900\nbut how do these all come into play,\nwhat can I build?\n\n9\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.380\nSo what I've done during this\ncourse is created a few projects,\n\n10\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.020\na couple of games and\na couple of non-games.\n\n11\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.720\nWhere we can really apply the skills that\nwe know, the features about the HTML5\n\n12\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.630\ncanvas, as well as sprinkled in a few\nother things from web development.\n\n13\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.820\nWhat are we gonna build?\n\n14\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.250\nWell, we have a couple of simple\ngames like Atmos Attackers.\n\n15\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.020\nWe have little creatures coming down\nthe screen and we're fending them off.\n\n16\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.830\nWhat else?\n\n17\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.160\nWe have an image editor.\n\n18\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.430\nWe have the ability to paint and scribe.\n\n19\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050\nAnd well, a few other ones, but you'll\nhave to come and see to figure those out.\n\n20\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.050\n&gt;&gt; Now who is this show targeted towards?\n\n21\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.510\n&gt;&gt; So this show is definitely for someone\nwho has some previous web development\n\n22\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.430\nexperience and admittedly,\nsome HTML5 canvas element experience.\n\n23\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.200\nWhat does that mean?\n\n24\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.590\nThat means you need to know some\nJavaScript, you need to know some HTML,\n\n25\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.750\nyou need to know probably not\nas much CSS as some other people\n\n26\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.920\nmay require you to know.\n\n27\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.870\nBut if you don't know those, then a lot of\nthe things that I'm gonna be doing in this\n\n28\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.990\ncourse, well,\nthey're gonna become difficult.\n\n29\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.070\nThey may not have any real kind of\nimpetus of why I am doing them.\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.110\nSo, I would say this is more of\nan intermediate level skill set required,\n\n31\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.730\nin order to start leveling up.\n\n32\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.110\nNow, with that said, that does not mean\nthat it cannot be approachable for\n\n33\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.000\nsomeone who, maybe has just started, and\nwants to see what the capabilities are for\n\n34\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.750\nthe HTML5 canvas element.\n\n35\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.553\n&gt;&gt; Justin, is there a certification\navailable for this?\n\n36\n00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:52.680\n&gt;&gt; So for this course,\nthere is no certification available.\n\n37\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.710\nMainly because it's gear toward, I know\na little bit, and I wanna know more.\n\n38\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.300\nI want to take the next step.\n\n39\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.540\nI want to power up, level up, so to speak.\n\n40\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.184\nSo there is no explicit certification\nother than the wonderful warm,\n\n41\n00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:07.990\nfuzzy feeling that you get by\ncreating graphics within the browser.\n\n42\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.340\nAnd seeing some of the power that is\ndivvied out by the browser environment.\n\n43\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.440\n&gt;&gt; So what topics are covered in the show?\n\n44\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.112\n&gt;&gt; So this show is taking those\nHTML5 canvas elements, like figures.\n\n45\n00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:25.545\nI have the canvas element, I have the 2D\nrendering context, and now I wanna\n\n46\n00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.630\nlearn how to create data models,\nin order to create a user interface,\n\n47\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.800\nin order to create interactivity to\ncreate games like Atmo Attackers.\n\n48\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.080\nAs well as, how do I draw on this?\n\n49\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540\nWhat kind of data structures do I need?\n\n50\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.610\nHow do I think about this?\n\n51\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.690\nHow do I attack?\n\n52\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.593\nNow I know that was\nvery general in nature.\n\n53\n00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:50.598\nSo it is more about application\nof the HTML 5 canvas element and\n\n54\n00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:53.670\nits associated kind of pieces.\n\n55\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.640\nAbout how to attack and\napproach solving a problem.\n\n56\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.846\nI have an idea for\nsomething I want to build.\n\n57\n00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:02.424\nHow do I take the skill set\nthat I know a little bit about,\n\n58\n00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:05.481\nplan it out, and\nthen make it come to fruition.\n\n59\n00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, this sounds like\nsomething you're excited about.\n\n60\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.350\nAnd I know I am.\n\n61\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.980\nYou're going to make sure to watch every\nsingle episode of HTML5 canvas projects.\n\n62\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.564\nThank you for watching DevPro TV.\n\n63\n00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.967\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.676\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:20.658\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nfor HTML Canvas Projects.\n\n5\n00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:23.747\nAnd this episode is Project Planning and\nSetup,\n\n6\n00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:28.630\nand Justin Dennison is our IT expert\nwho's gonna help us with this subject.\n\n7\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.250\nJustin, thanks for being here.\n\n8\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.400\n&gt;&gt; I am excited to be here today, Zach.\n\n9\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.390\nBut before we move on because it's kind\nof a cryptic title, admittedly so.\n\n10\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.590\nBut we'll get there in just a moment.\n\n11\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.260\nHow are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.725\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm excited because I love\nanything that you have to tell us is\n\n13\n00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:44.616\nalways very informative and\nwonderful, and let's go.\n\n14\n00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.400\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you're patronizing me.\n\n15\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.170\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Or trying to make my head, who knows?\n\n16\n00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.610\nSo project planning is set up,\n\n17\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.120\nand in particular let me just\ngive you a quick overview.\n\n18\n00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.380\nOur ultimate goal is to build\na homage to Pong, we'll call it Pong.\n\n19\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.720\nWe're gonna make table tennis graphically.\n\n20\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.290\n&gt;&gt; That's very exciting.\n\n21\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.260\n&gt;&gt; And really, right, and\nagain, that's what our goal is.\n\n22\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.046\nIn order to get ready for\nthat, it's important to plan.\n\n23\n00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.621\nI wanna be a little more\nexplicit about how do I plan?\n\n24\n00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:14.501\nHow do I think about this?\n\n25\n00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:15.448\nHow do I problem solve?\n\n26\n00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:19.145\nBecause programming in\ngeneral is problem solving.\n\n27\n00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.745\nYou have to know some other tools, but\n\n28\n00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.985\nyou have to be able to solve the problems\nbefore implementation ever comes out.\n\n29\n00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.835\nSo our ultimate goal here\nis to plan out our project.\n\n30\n00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:27.545\nWhat are we gonna need?\n\n31\n00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.445\nAnd that can be in flux.\n\n32\n00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:33.165\nIt can change over\nthe course of the project.\n\n33\n00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.895\nBut here's our initial planning phase.\n\n34\n00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.405\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and\nset up our project so\n\n35\n00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:41.140\nwe can kind of hit the ground running\nwith building our individual pieces.\n\n36\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.540\nOne thing that I do recommend is that you\nknow a little bit about HTML5 Canvas,\n\n37\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.940\nabout graphics in the browser.\n\n38\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.170\nIf you do not, than definitely go\ncheck out our course library where\n\n39\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.020\nthere's several things on web development,\nusing the DOM,\n\n40\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.100\nas well as the HTML5 Canvas element and\nanimations and such.\n\n41\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.440\nSo definitely go check that out.\n\n42\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.728\nNow let's back up.\n\n43\n00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:09.027\nLet me re-emphasize,\nwe are building Pong, Zach.\n\n44\n00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:13.724\nAnd Zach says he's excited,\nbut our first stage is\n\n45\n00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:19.090\nactually a little bit of setup,\na little bit of planning.\n\n46\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.670\nAnd I like to draw.\n\n47\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.518\nDrawing is actually a really good way\nto kind of wrap your mind around what\n\n48\n00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:30.370\ndo I need to be able to do to make this\ncome to fruition programmatically.\n\n49\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.960\nSo we're actually gonna draw, and just\nto be very transparent about my process,\n\n50\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.040\nlet's go ahead and\ncome over the Skycam and think about that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.250\nSo ooh, some pretty markers.\n\n52\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.920\nAnd it's nice and pretty,\nso let's think about this.\n\n53\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.320\nIn some other episodes I've kind of\ninset the canvas inside of here.\n\n54\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.570\nI'm thinking that maybe we just\nmake the whole page a canvas.\n\n55\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.160\nSo when you come to\nthe actual browser window,\n\n56\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.570\nthe entire area is the ping pong board.\n\n57\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.780\n&gt;&gt; So in the previous episodes\nin the canvas it was 400 by 600.\n\n58\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.997\nWhat's this gonna be?\n\n59\n00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:13.145\n&gt;&gt; This is going to be whatever the size\nof the window is big, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:13.993\nIt's gonna be 100% and 100%.\n\n61\n00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:21.213\nNow we're gonna do that and\nthat's gonna be a little iffy.\n\n62\n00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:22.756\nAnd that's my plan.\n\n63\n00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:26.873\nWe may have to change that a little\nbit in order to get things rolling.\n\n64\n00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.590\nSo let's go ahead and\nthink about what do we need?\n\n65\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.886\nIf this is our entire canvas,\nin order to play Pong,\n\n66\n00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:38.293\nyou kinda have this little\npaddle over here, right?\n\n67\n00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:43.017\nAnd then you have some ball and then you\nhave another little paddle over here, and\n\n68\n00:03:43.017 --> 00:03:47.901\nthese aren't necessarily, this is not\nsomething where you have to draw it exact.\n\n69\n00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.240\nYou're in the planning phase.\n\n70\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.450\nSo this ball,\nit'll probably start in the center, and\n\n71\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.980\nit'll have some random direction.\n\n72\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.720\nNow in order to make this simplified,\n\n73\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.770\nI think I'm just gonna make\nit a random direction.\n\n74\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Really,\n\n75\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.650\nyou know when you're playing table tennis,\nif they score,\n\n76\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.990\nthey get to serve again,\nand it goes the other way.\n\n77\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.440\nBut let's simplify the game.\n\n78\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.105\nIt's kind of a minimal viable solution.\n\n79\n00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:15.937\nSo here's our ball, and\nif it's moving this way, then-\n\n80\n00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:17.294\n&gt;&gt; That's positive.\n\n81\n00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.698\n&gt;&gt; They would get crazy, and\nyes, Zach, you're exactly right,\n\n82\n00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:23.220\nthat is a positive x direction.\n\n83\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.020\n&gt;&gt; If it was moving this way,\nthat would be a negative y direction.\n\n84\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.970\nIt it's moving this way, and\njust to be explicit, this is y,\n\n85\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.870\nthis is x,\nthis would be a negative x direction.\n\n86\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.750\nAnd then here would be positive.\n\n87\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.360\nAnd we have to keep that in mind,\n\n88\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.960\nwhen we're doing this cuz zero's up here,\nand I'm gonna move it.\n\n89\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.520\nSo we're gonna move back and forth.\n\n90\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.590\nIf the ball, right, so\nlet's say that this is moved over here.\n\n91\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.510\nIf the ball hits here,\nI wanna put a point, right.\n\n92\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.920\nSo they have 1 and they have 0.\n\n93\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the ball moved over here.\n\n94\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.320\nIt is now here.\n\n95\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.830\nIt is no longer here.\n\n96\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.360\nIt went past the paddle of\nthe right-hand player, player two,\n\n97\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.440\nmaybe we call it the computer player,\nand your point.\n\n98\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.160\nAnd then it gets dropped\nback in the middle and\n\n99\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.260\nrandomly goes in some direction.\n\n100\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.840\nWhen it strikes, and just to show you,\nthis is a single piece of paper but\n\n101\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.730\nI'm going through multiple kind of things.\n\n102\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.570\nLet's say that the ball was moving\nthis way, right, and then struck here.\n\n103\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.106\nWell, what we wanna do is we\nwanna switch the x direction.\n\n104\n00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.620\nWe wanna bounce off.\n\n105\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.650\nSo by switching that,\nthe ball's gonna kinda move here.\n\n106\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.082\nAnd then we don't want it to go\noff the table because, I mean,\n\n107\n00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:54.768\nin real life that that makes sense, but in\ncomputers it really should bounce here and\n\n108\n00:05:54.768 --> 00:06:00.400\nthen, Boom, and then so\non and so forth, right?\n\n109\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Now ideally, depending on where it\n\n110\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.930\nhits, we can change the dynamics, but for\nnow, we're just gonna say it bounces.\n\n111\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.150\nThe only places it does not\nbounce are on the left and\n\n112\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.670\nright that do not have paddle portions.\n\n113\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.590\nSo it's gonna bounce off the paddle,\nbut it's not going to bounce here.\n\n114\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.200\nIf this were to come back, and\nlet's say this paddle doesn't move, and\n\n115\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.310\nhit here and I know that's kind of an arc,\njust because I'm running out of space.\n\n116\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.987\nThen that would now change this to 2 and\nthis would be still 0.\n\n117\n00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:37.489\nIn addition to,\nsince this is gonna be a game,\n\n118\n00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:41.160\nI don't know that the original ones,\nwe could set a win condition.\n\n119\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.700\nFirst person to get to five,\nright, first player.\n\n120\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.290\nNow that I've kind of grouped\nthe dynamics, right, the actions,\n\n121\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.910\nthis may change.\n\n122\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.230\nLet's do a little bit of planning\nabout what I need to build.\n\n123\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.472\nWell, I need a paddle or\npaddles, or paddles,\n\n124\n00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:05.328\nso there's a paddle and there's a paddle.\n\n125\n00:07:08.183 --> 00:07:14.860\nAnd then well, we need our ball, and\nmost people, that's all you need.\n\n126\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.420\nHowever, we actually need a scoreboard.\n\n127\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.640\n&gt;&gt; A counter.\n\n128\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:29.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthis is like our scoreboard, As such.\n\n129\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160\nIn addition to this\nentire area is our game.\n\n130\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n131\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.328\n&gt;&gt; So all contained within the game,\nyou have a scoreboard object,\n\n132\n00:07:38.328 --> 00:07:43.018\na paddle object, a ball object,\nand then another paddle object.\n\n133\n00:07:43.018 --> 00:07:47.209\nNow if this was two players,\nright, or if we had controllers,\n\n134\n00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:51.478\nwe just need to say hey,\nthe left controller is this person, and\n\n135\n00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:55.220\nthe right controller is this person,\nor the joystick.\n\n136\n00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.570\nIf we wanted to make this\na computer opponent Then\n\n137\n00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.800\nthis paddle would also be a player,\nall right?\n\n138\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.270\nSo you are the human player.\n\n139\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.820\nThis paddle would also be a computer and\n\n140\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.800\nit could be an AI or something like that.\n\n141\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.420\nWe, they both have paddle attributes.\n\n142\n00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.230\nSo we can say,\nlet's just build a paddle first.\n\n143\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.510\nAnd as long as it conforms\nto what we need for\n\n144\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.190\npaddles, we can add additional portions.\n\n145\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.580\nSo, I'm gonna show you.\n\n146\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.300\nOkay, now we have this\nmiddle rival solution.\n\n147\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.320\n&gt;&gt; Let's extend this rung hand,\nit's still technically a paddle.\n\n149\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.522\nWe're gonna extend it to have computer or\nautomatic opponent like abilities.\n\n150\n00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:48.290\nIt's like, let's just say,\ninstead of staying still, right?\n\n151\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.190\nWaiting for control-\n&gt;&gt; It drags the ball.\n\n152\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.941\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's an unbeatable computer component.\n\n153\n00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:56.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Kind of drags the ball,\na little bit.\n\n154\n00:08:56.935 --> 00:08:58.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking,\n\n155\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.340\njust it could be based on\ndifficulty level, all right?\n\n156\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.210\nSo easy difficulty,\nall it does is move up and down.\n\n157\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.610\nThere you go, right?\n\n158\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.628\nIf it was medium difficulty level,\n\n159\n00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:14.570\nit could trap the ball if the ball\nwas in like this amount of it, right?\n\n160\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.775\nAnd then hard level,\nwe just make that bigger.\n\n161\n00:09:17.775 --> 00:09:18.825\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:21.640\n&gt;&gt; So there's a bunch of different\nthings but that's my initial plan.\n\n163\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.282\nI'm not really worried about that, because\nthe minimum viable solution is I need\n\n164\n00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:28.519\na scoreboard, I need two paddles,\nI need a ball, and I need a game area.\n\n165\n00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.790\n&gt;&gt; A game area, right.\n\n166\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.068\n&gt;&gt; So\nonce I have all of that put together,\n\n167\n00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:36.800\nthen we're gonna build this individual\npieces and then test them individually.\n\n168\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.040\nSomething I see a lot of times is people\ntry to build all this at once and\n\n169\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.380\nwhen they try to run it,\nthey never run it.\n\n170\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.490\nNothing happens,\nit get all kinds of errors.\n\n171\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.640\nSo probably what I'm going to do is first,\nright,\n\n172\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.050\nthe score board, it doesn't make sense for\nthe score board to do anything.\n\n173\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.310\nUnless the other parts are in the game,\nright?\n\n174\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.300\nI can't keep score.\n\n175\n00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.723\nNow, I could put some static text up\nthere, or something of that nature, but\n\n176\n00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:06.755\nit doesn't make sense for the score\nboard to actually be built first.\n\n177\n00:10:06.755 --> 00:10:11.435\n&gt;&gt; Could you also put advertisements for\nfanciful candy bars up there as well?\n\n178\n00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:13.579\n&gt;&gt; We could,\nwe could possibly do a background.\n\n179\n00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:16.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's crazy.\n\n180\n00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:20.276\nBut I think until we have the ball moving,\nthe paddles don't really matter.\n\n181\n00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:23.077\nAnd again this my design process.\n\n182\n00:10:23.077 --> 00:10:26.947\nSo I think I'm gonna build the ball first,\nmake sure the ball moves.\n\n183\n00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:29.551\nIn addition to,\nI gonna make sure that the hands and\n\n184\n00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.447\nbehavior that wanna hits the edge,\nthese left and right edges, it resets.\n\n185\n00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:38.367\nAnd this maybe through a few iterations,\nwe may have to refactor.\n\n186\n00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:40.193\nAnd then we'll add paddle.\n\n187\n00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:41.954\nAnd then,\nwe'll probably had to come back and\n\n188\n00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:43.950\nchange the ball to do a little\nbit of manual testing.\n\n189\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.700\nNow we could write automated test,\nbut I don't wanna muddy the waters.\n\n190\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.690\nBut this is our first project,\nthis is what we wanna build.\n\n191\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.710\nAnd I think this helps submit some of\nthe things that we originally learned\n\n192\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.860\nin some of the other\nepisodes that we have done.\n\n193\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.570\n&gt;&gt; So that is our initial plan.\n\n194\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.791\nWe may have to come back and\nrefine that from time to time because,\n\n195\n00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:11.169\nI didn't think about it needs this and\nthis.\n\n196\n00:11:11.169 --> 00:11:13.630\nAnd what is that doing, right?\n\n197\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.104\nSo now that we have our initial plan,\nkind of our snapshot of ideas,\n\n198\n00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:22.530\nwe probably need to go ahead and\nset up our project.\n\n199\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.616\nJust to get things rolling, right?\n\n200\n00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:27.310\nWe wanna make sure that\neverything's good to go.\n\n201\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.270\nSo then when we start making our ball,\nwhen we start making our paddles,\n\n202\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.830\nwhen we start making our score boards or\nour game, then it's all ready to go.\n\n203\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.960\nIn addition to,\nI'm not gonna put this all in a file,\n\n204\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.440\nI'm gonna organize this\na little bit differently.\n\n205\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:46.100\nSo do keep that in mind,\nthis is gonna use file structures\n\n206\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.010\nto emphasize the segmentation, kind of\nthe removal of all this code in one place.\n\n207\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.148\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome in to my computer screen and\n\n208\n00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.188\nactually get that project set up.\n\n209\n00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:00.077\nCome in to my computer screen,\nlike everybody's gonna jump in and\n\n210\n00:12:00.077 --> 00:12:01.427\nyou all start showing up here.\n\n211\n00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:03.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be crazy.\n\n212\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.210\nSo I have, just this,\nit's just the word pong,\n\n213\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.080\nit's just a folder called pong,\nlike ping pong.\n\n214\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.380\nAnd that is nested in another folder that\nyou may or may not necessarily need for\n\n215\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.140\nHTM5L-Canvas-Projects and it's just pong.\n\n216\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.530\nNow, you will notice I have few things\ninstalled already, and this is because\n\n217\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.480\nthe assumption is you already have a\nlittle bit of web development experience.\n\n218\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.030\nYou already have the kind\nof some of these skills.\n\n219\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.570\nSo you probably have\nthese already installed.\n\n220\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.970\nI'm using Atom for my text editor.\n\n221\n00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.320\nYou do not have to.\n\n222\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.490\nYou can actually use any type\nof text editor that you want.\n\n223\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.300\nI use Atom, well,\ncuz it works for me, I like it.\n\n224\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.380\nNow that might not always be the case,\nbut for now, that is.\n\n225\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.130\nIn addition to, I'm on a Mac so\nI do a little bit of command line stuff.\n\n226\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.820\nThat's a little added bonus,\nthat's just kind of my work flow.\n\n227\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.580\nI will try to show you both\nways if there's some craziness.\n\n228\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.580\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna to use the Chrome web browser.\n\n229\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.480\nSo we need to install Chrome.\n\n230\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.490\nWe need to install Atom.\n\n231\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.390\nAnd then you should have some ability to,\nyou\n\n232\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.660\ndon't have to have the terminal window,\nthe command line interface.\n\n233\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.788\nIt's just something that I do because\nI have a lot of keyboard shortcuts and\n\n234\n00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:22.740\nI do things like that.\n\n235\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.550\nSo, well, Chrome,\nwe're gonna try Google Chrome.\n\n236\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.397\nWell, if you type in\nGoogle Chrome in Chrome,\n\n237\n00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:31.542\nit actually takes you to\nthe Download Chrome page.\n\n238\n00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:32.348\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Chrome.\n\n239\n00:13:32.348 --> 00:13:34.632\n&gt;&gt; If you do that in any browser and\nyou go to Google.com, and\n\n240\n00:13:34.632 --> 00:13:37.360\nyou type in Google Chrome,\nit will actually show up.\n\n241\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.360\nThis first one is an ad.\n\n242\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.150\nBut the second one or this Download Now\nshould take you to the Download page.\n\n243\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.040\nAlways double check the URL.\n\n244\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.340\nSo if I go to Download Now, that's fine.\n\n245\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.532\nNotice that it actually says,\nhttps://www.google.com.\n\n246\n00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:57.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I understand that.\n\n247\n00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:02.770\n&gt;&gt; And then, atom.io is our other one.\n\n248\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:08.230\nAtom is supported on Mac Windows and\nin Linux platforms.\n\n249\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.910\nIt will auto detect what\nplatform that you're on.\n\n250\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.040\nAnd so let's move that over there.\n\n251\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.770\nIt says, hey, you're on Mac, yeah?\n\n252\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.970\nYou're just gonna download,\nyou run it, you install.\n\n253\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.050\nIt does have some minimal requirements\nof your older version of Windows.\n\n254\n00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:25.593\nIt could get a little iffy.\n\n255\n00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:30.928\nIf it's really old then,\nthere's probably no way it's gonna happen.\n\n256\n00:14:30.928 --> 00:14:35.390\nBut for Linux, it's cross by form, so\nyour experience should be similar to mine.\n\n257\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.300\nI do have added on packages and\n\n258\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.860\nI'll try illustrate those\nwhen those become an issue.\n\n259\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.879\nAnd it's mostly syntax how\nletting of things to that nature.\n\n260\n00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:48.270\nSo we would download and store that,\nand you actually get this window, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.242\nNow, just to try to keep things uniform,\n\n262\n00:14:52.242 --> 00:14:58.480\nonce you have this window open,\nas such, we're good to go.\n\n263\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.936\nNow, how do l get that inside of Atom?\n\n264\n00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:08.780\nl went to File, Add Project folder, and\nso and I just added that entire folder.\n\n265\n00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.738\nSo that folder is now in\nthe left-hand side all ready to go.\n\n266\n00:15:11.738 --> 00:15:16.745\nIf you ever wanna hide that,\nit's either CTRL on Windows and\n\n267\n00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:23.046\nLinux or Command on Mac and then the back\nslash, the one above the enter key.\n\n268\n00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:25.210\nAnd it will just hide and reveal that.\n\n269\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.360\nSo those are nice little tricks.\n\n270\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.510\nSo you may see me doing that\na little bit just for real estate.\n\n271\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.790\nSo we have these,\nnow what do I need in this project?\n\n272\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.980\nThese kind of animation game type\nthings can be on a single page.\n\n273\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.562\nThey can be a simple HTML page.\n\n274\n00:15:42.562 --> 00:15:44.800\nI'm gonna follow a couple of conventions.\n\n275\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.775\nI'm gonna create an index\nof html inside the pong.\n\n276\n00:15:47.775 --> 00:15:52.541\nAnd then,\nI'm going to create a new file called,\n\n277\n00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:59.590\nlet's call it amp.js However,\nhow app.js is going to be our main file.\n\n278\n00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.490\nWe will eventually have\nanother folder called JS and\n\n279\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.310\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate that just to illustrate.\n\n280\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.480\nRight now, we only need these two files.\n\n281\n00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.320\nHowever, this JS portion will\nhave other files for the ball,\n\n282\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.100\na paddle, a player, computer player,\nhowever we decide to organize that.\n\n283\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.596\nNow taking a more of an organic approach,\nyou can see,\n\n284\n00:16:26.596 --> 00:16:29.798\nwhat are the thought processes and\nthe decisions that need to be made,\n\n285\n00:16:29.798 --> 00:16:32.380\ninstead of making it look so\nmuch like magic?\n\n286\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.220\nAnd hopefully that helps break\ndown the barriers of, wow,\n\n287\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.540\nhe's really good at that,\nI don't know if I could do that.\n\n288\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.070\nSo this JS folder is empty for\nnow, but we will be using it.\n\n289\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:47.438\nWe're good, we may need a CSS file and\nthen we'll add that as needed.\n\n290\n00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:52.479\nI'm trying to keep minimal on the CSS for\nnow.\n\n291\n00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:55.119\nBut if we decide to come back and add it,\n\n292\n00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:59.230\nwe'll definitely do that\nas the situation needs it.\n\n293\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.020\nSo now that we have this and\n\n294\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.004\nyou have it open in Atom,\nAtom has this handy shortcut.\n\n295\n00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:08.242\nYou just type html and hit Enter, it will\nactually stub out an HTML 5 file for you.\n\n296\n00:17:08.242 --> 00:17:14.260\nSo doc type html,\nthat's html file, we're good.\n\n297\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.017\nAnd what is this?\n\n298\n00:17:15.017 --> 00:17:17.544\nWe're just gonna call it Pong and\n\n299\n00:17:17.544 --> 00:17:22.065\nthen within the body,\nwe only need a couple of things here.\n\n300\n00:17:22.065 --> 00:17:26.778\nWe need the Canvas element, and\nwe really should have a fallback.\n\n301\n00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:32.300\nYour browser does not\nsupport the canvas element.\n\n302\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:40.828\nSo if someone visits this, or tries to\nlook at this on a older browser that\n\n303\n00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:46.912\nis not supported on the Canvas element,\neh, eh, kinda broke.\n\n304\n00:17:46.912 --> 00:17:51.929\nAnd just to make sure things are good,\nlet's add a class.\n\n305\n00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:55.214\nI tend to like selecting based on classes.\n\n306\n00:17:55.214 --> 00:17:56.499\nIt's just kind of a personal preference.\n\n307\n00:17:56.499 --> 00:18:00.245\nI stay away from IDs cuz it puts\nyou in this weird idea that,\n\n308\n00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.300\nthis is a very special one.\n\n309\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.109\nI could have a bunch of\nthese canvases on this page.\n\n310\n00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:08.350\nMaybe l have a gallery of all\nthe Canvas projects that I've built.\n\n311\n00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.542\nAnd l need to style all of them the same.\n\n312\n00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:18.480\nWell, I'm gonna use a class and then if\nl need to select this very specific one,\n\n313\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.507\nl'll add an ID later or I will select\nthat individual one as I need it.\n\n314\n00:18:24.507 --> 00:18:28.343\nJust give it a canvas class and\n\n315\n00:18:28.343 --> 00:18:34.029\nlet's ahead and give it width, 100%.\n\n316\n00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:37.763\nHm, how are we going to do that?\n\n317\n00:18:37.763 --> 00:18:40.280\nLet's see here.\n\n318\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.560\nI think I might, no.\n\n319\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.413\nSo, I need to give it a width here, right?\n\n320\n00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:50.295\nAnd if we come to documentation and\nI look at the Canvas Element.\n\n321\n00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:56.706\nSo if I say, canvas, so\nI'm in the Mozilla Developers Networks,\n\n322\n00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:59.120\ndeveloper.mozilla.org.\n\n323\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.304\nAnd I'm gonna look at the Canvas Element.\n\n324\n00:19:02.304 --> 00:19:06.880\nAnd I come down here, the height\nof coordinate space in CSS pixel,\n\n325\n00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.390\nthis defaults to 150, and\nthen the width defaults to 300.\n\n326\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:17.692\nNow we could leave those be, but\nthen we're gonna get weirdness there.\n\n327\n00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:24.359\nWhat we probably will do is now\njust set this programatically.\n\n328\n00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:26.661\nAnd that way it will fill.\n\n329\n00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:29.711\nBut for now,\njust to make sure things are good,\n\n330\n00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:34.030\nwe're gonna hardcode this and\ntry to make it fairly large.\n\n331\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:39.424\nSo if I come in here and I say width is,\n\n332\n00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:45.868\nI don't know, 800, height is 600.\n\n333\n00:19:45.868 --> 00:19:50.250\nAnd notice these are in quotes, but\nit actually ends up being a number.\n\n334\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.770\nWe're good to go there and\nour Canvas element set up.\n\n335\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.130\nThe other thing that we need here is and\n\n336\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.430\nI was gonna ready to do a shortcut\nwithout being explicit.\n\n337\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.430\nI need that app.js file,\nthat's kind of our main entry point.\n\n338\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.120\nWe will add additional\nJavaScript as needed.\n\n339\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.870\nBut we should be good and\nsomething that I like to do.\n\n340\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.980\nJust to make sure everything's good,\n\n341\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.129\njust a put a console.log in my app.js,\nit works.\n\n342\n00:20:16.587 --> 00:20:20.800\nOr just start adding random spaces places.\n\n343\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.810\nIf we come over here,\nyou're asking, how do you open it?\n\n344\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.213\nWell, I actually typically open\nthings from the command line, and\n\n345\n00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:29.331\nI have defaults set up.\n\n346\n00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:33.146\nBut just for uniformity,\nI'm gonna say File, and\n\n347\n00:20:33.146 --> 00:20:37.858\nif you can't find File,\nit's Alt+F, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n348\n00:20:37.858 --> 00:20:40.905\nOpen File, and we're gonna open a File.\n\n349\n00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:43.507\nAnd then we're gonna come\nover here to my desktop,\n\n350\n00:20:43.507 --> 00:20:45.980\nwhich is where I put this projects.\n\n351\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.842\nAnd then I clicked on the folder,\nand then I clicked on pong.\n\n352\n00:20:49.842 --> 00:20:56.336\nAnd then I'm gonna open that index.html,\nopen.\n\n353\n00:20:56.336 --> 00:20:58.301\nAnd it looks like nothing, and\n\n354\n00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:02.320\nthat's because this canvas\nelement is kind of hidden.\n\n355\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.101\nBut right there,\nif we open up the dev tools,\n\n356\n00:21:05.101 --> 00:21:09.657\nwhich we can open with these dot dot dots,\nMore tools &gt; Developer tools.\n\n357\n00:21:09.657 --> 00:21:11.990\nI will typically have\nthose open on the side.\n\n358\n00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.083\nAnd if you have Web Development Experience\nhere, you're like, I get this.\n\n359\n00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:17.044\nBu I know a lot of people who are like,\nyeah,\n\n360\n00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:18.855\nI've been doing the web dev for a while.\n\n361\n00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:20.615\nAnd you're like, open dev tools,\nand they're like.\n\n362\n00:21:20.615 --> 00:21:24.033\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What you talking about?\n\n363\n00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.480\nSo, just to be explicit here.\n\n364\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.350\nBut I'm gonna typically\nopen this up on the side.\n\n365\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.490\nKeep it open on the side.\n\n366\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.603\nAnd notice it works as\nprinted from app.js.\n\n367\n00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:34.258\nThat means our JavaScript file works.\n\n368\n00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:36.508\nIt's all kinda wired together.\n\n369\n00:21:36.508 --> 00:21:40.590\nAnd if I click this little arrow and\nI come over here,\n\n370\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:46.010\nthere's the body, and\nthen there is the canvas element, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.790\nSo, there we go.\n\n372\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.680\nWe're all set up, and we'll probably\nstretch this programmatically but\n\n373\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.800\nthat's our ultimate setup.\n\n374\n00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.840\nThat's all we need as far as basic setup.\n\n375\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.860\nNow we got a few more minutes,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n376\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.020\ndo a little bit of\nmaintenance if you will.\n\n377\n00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.750\nAnd try to get this things together.\n\n378\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.194\nAnd so I'm gonna hop back over,\n\n379\n00:22:11.194 --> 00:22:16.517\nI'm actually gonna do a quick\nrearrange of this atom,\n\n380\n00:22:16.517 --> 00:22:20.914\nand I'm gonna grab the canvass element,\nand\n\n381\n00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:25.680\ndocument.query Selector\nof .canvas like so.\n\n382\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.931\nAnd then I'm going to console.log\nthe canvas element, and\n\n383\n00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:40.350\nconsole.log the window object,\nso the window is everything.\n\n384\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.540\nAnd you'll see why in just a moment.\n\n385\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.350\nSo here's our canvas element, that's good.\n\n386\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.920\nWe can actually console.dir and\nget a drop down.\n\n387\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:56.080\nBut if we look at the window and\nwe come down here and we look, well,\n\n388\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.700\nlet's see here we have screen x, screen y.\n\n389\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.480\nAnd we have to keep scrolling, I\n\n390\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.080\nactually need-\n&gt;&gt; Justin,\n\n391\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.110\nI'm not entirely sure why you are putting\nout the canvas object to begin with.\n\n392\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.970\nCan you be a little bit more clear?\n\n393\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.980\n&gt;&gt; So I'm putting up both of these\nobjects just to make sure that I selected\n\n394\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.280\nthe canvas object but\nI'm also printing out the window object\n\n395\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.000\nas I'm kinda looking\nthrough here a little bit.\n\n396\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.214\nThere's a lot of stuff\non the window object.\n\n397\n00:23:27.214 --> 00:23:29.144\nBut I'm looking for\nsomething in particular.\n\n398\n00:23:29.144 --> 00:23:31.351\nI'm looking for widths and\nheight of the windows.\n\n399\n00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:32.261\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n400\n00:23:32.261 --> 00:23:33.598\ndiagrammatically change\nthe canvas width and height.\n\n401\n00:23:33.598 --> 00:23:34.370\n&gt;&gt; Right on, Right on.\n\n402\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.670\n&gt;&gt; And move it about, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.530\nSo let's actually come back to my screen,\n\n404\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.556\nbecause I think I found\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n405\n00:23:40.556 --> 00:23:45.171\nI feel like there's a song\nin there somewhere.\n\n406\n00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:46.236\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n407\n00:23:46.236 --> 00:23:47.132\nsorry.\n\n408\n00:23:47.132 --> 00:23:52.775\n&gt;&gt; So this, that was beautiful, I tell you\nwhat, we need to release that on audio.\n\n409\n00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:58.211\nIf I come in here and I look, there's\nthis inner width of the window object.\n\n410\n00:23:58.211 --> 00:23:58.967\nNow it's fairly big.\n\n411\n00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:03.744\nWe may have to adjust this, but this is a\ngreat way to programatically go boop, and\n\n412\n00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:06.667\nmake the canvas really big and\nfill up the window.\n\n413\n00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:09.485\nThis may not be what you\nwant if you have a gallery.\n\n414\n00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:12.838\nBut if you want a single\npage full playing game.\n\n415\n00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:13.557\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we want.\n\n416\n00:24:13.557 --> 00:24:17.635\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what we want, that's\nwhat I originally, our plans may change.\n\n417\n00:24:17.635 --> 00:24:19.554\nWe're gonna do that little bit there and\n\n418\n00:24:19.554 --> 00:24:22.941\nif I come back over here because I\nhave the innerHeight and innerWidth,\n\n419\n00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.450\nI was trying to remember those properties,\nbut I just wanted to show you.\n\n420\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.663\nThere's a lot in there.\n\n421\n00:24:27.663 --> 00:24:29.098\nI scrolled over it like three times.\n\n422\n00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:30.794\nIt was crazy.\n\n423\n00:24:30.794 --> 00:24:36.206\nWe're just going to set\nup the canvas size.\n\n424\n00:24:36.206 --> 00:24:44.907\nSo here,\ncanvas.height = window.innerHeight, Maybe.\n\n425\n00:24:44.907 --> 00:24:50.929\nAnd then canvas.width = window.innerWidth.\n\n426\n00:24:50.929 --> 00:24:52.628\nLike so, okay?\n\n427\n00:24:52.628 --> 00:24:56.575\nNow, before I go and\nrefresh, if I click here and\n\n428\n00:24:56.575 --> 00:25:01.502\nactually click it,\nnotice this is how big the canvas is now.\n\n429\n00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:04.908\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's 800 x 600, and\n\n430\n00:25:04.908 --> 00:25:07.986\nthat is set by this amount.\n\n431\n00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:12.098\nNow, I double clicked by\nan accidental gesture there, but\n\n432\n00:25:12.098 --> 00:25:17.456\nif I come back into the console,\neverything's fine, everything's good.\n\n433\n00:25:17.456 --> 00:25:21.256\nThere it is, if I refresh now,\nthese are gone and\n\n434\n00:25:21.256 --> 00:25:24.798\nnotice this is actually\nthe canvas element.\n\n435\n00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:29.076\nAnd let me see if I can scroll\ndown to the bottom here.\n\n436\n00:25:29.076 --> 00:25:30.641\nIt's kind of hard to see.\n\n437\n00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:35.223\nSee that canvas element\nis now 1296 by 1060.\n\n438\n00:25:35.223 --> 00:25:38.295\nOkay, what does this provide us?\n\n439\n00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:43.456\nWell, if I move this,\nit's actually the full width, so\n\n440\n00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:49.381\nit's not quite responsive, so\nwe may get some weird squishing.\n\n441\n00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:53.233\nSo I'm going to inspect and\nit's kind of hard to inspect, but\n\n442\n00:25:53.233 --> 00:25:56.284\nit's gonna give me the full\nwidth of the window.\n\n443\n00:25:56.284 --> 00:26:00.209\nThere may be times where we need to turn\nthat off to kind of just understand what's\n\n444\n00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:03.571\ngoing on while the dev tools are open or\nwe could pop the dev tools out.\n\n445\n00:26:03.571 --> 00:26:08.183\nBut I wanted it to fill the window to\ngive you the full two picture experience.\n\n446\n00:26:08.183 --> 00:26:09.431\n&gt;&gt; The immersive experience.\n\n447\n00:26:09.431 --> 00:26:12.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\nthat's one way that you can set that.\n\n448\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.607\nAnd notice that it is reflected\nby the width and height here.\n\n449\n00:26:16.607 --> 00:26:22.614\nAnd we can always set a width and\nheight for something and have it fill and\n\n450\n00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:27.537\nsome other things, but\nthat is our most important set up.\n\n451\n00:26:27.537 --> 00:26:30.122\nIn our index.html file,\nin our app.js, we need to set\n\n452\n00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:33.760\nup a canvas size programatically because\nyours may be a little bit different.\n\n453\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.251\nThere's not necessarily anything\nmagic about those numbers,\n\n454\n00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:39.003\nbut we're gonna make them big.\n\n455\n00:26:39.003 --> 00:26:42.373\nBut I set it programmatically,\nthat way we can turn it off.\n\n456\n00:26:42.373 --> 00:26:45.815\nDo you remember we have an 800 by\n600 fallback if we turn that off?\n\n457\n00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:47.319\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it'll shrink back down.\n\n458\n00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:48.191\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n459\n00:26:48.191 --> 00:26:51.722\n&gt;&gt; And then we can observe with\nthe dev tools open all on one screen.\n\n460\n00:26:51.722 --> 00:26:54.817\nBut Zach, that's our plan, our setup.\n\n461\n00:26:54.817 --> 00:26:59.492\nWell, we're ready to move on\nto probably making the ball.\n\n462\n00:26:59.492 --> 00:27:02.470\nJust have some of the behaviors\nthat we want it to.\n\n463\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.604\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, project planning and set up.\n\n464\n00:27:04.604 --> 00:27:06.083\nAnd next we're gonna be making the ball.\n\n465\n00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:07.550\nIt's gonna be great.\n\n466\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.246\nAny last words before we move?\n\n467\n00:27:09.246 --> 00:27:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, definitely stay tuned.\n\n468\n00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:14.362\nThis is a series that is kind\nof meant to build upon itself,\n\n469\n00:27:14.362 --> 00:27:19.502\nto provide context of why you would use\ncertain things in the HTML 5 Canvas,\n\n470\n00:27:19.502 --> 00:27:22.819\nthat I don't really\nunderstand why you do that.\n\n471\n00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:27.102\nSo let's actually use these in\nsomething that we're building and\n\n472\n00:27:27.102 --> 00:27:32.312\nhopefully you're building along with me,\nand see how those all come together.\n\n473\n00:27:32.312 --> 00:27:36.672\n&gt;&gt; Awesome Justin, and I don't know\nabout you, but I'm very excited about\n\n474\n00:27:36.672 --> 00:27:40.555\nHTML Canvas projects as we do\nour homage as it continues.\n\n475\n00:27:40.555 --> 00:27:44.280\nHey, make sure also that you go to our\ncourse library and check out the hundreds\n\n476\n00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.285\nof videos that are there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n477\n00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:49.451\nAnd tell all your friends about DevProTV.\n\n478\n00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:50.511\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n479\n00:27:50.511 --> 00:27:51.206\nThanks for watching.\n\n480\n00:27:51.206 --> 00:27:52.119\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n481\n00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:52.967\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n482\n00:27:52.967 --> 00:27:55.402\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again very soon.\n\n483\n00:27:55.402 -->

I'm supposed to do that?\n\n9\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.297\nI thought you had a plan.\n\n10\n00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:36.310\n&gt;&gt; You do it.\n\n11\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.901\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's me.\n\n12\n00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.080\nHow are you doing today, Zach?\n\n13\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and\nI'm excited, very excited.\n\n14\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited as well because\nwe're taking this pieces are and\n\n15\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.260\nwe're starting to put them together,\nright.\n\n16\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.680\nOur first step, really you can't have,\nlet's just call it ping pong,\n\n17\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.180\nit's like table tennis.\n\n18\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.630\nWe're building table tennis and\nhomage to the classic pong game.\n\n19\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.000\nTwo paddles and a ball.\n\n20\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.780\nYou need to have the two paddles,\n\n21\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.000\nyou can't really play table tennis\nwithout the ping pong ball or the ball.\n\n22\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.250\nSo we are going to build a ball today,\n\n23\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.600\nand there's a couple of things that you\nhave to think about, what do I need?\n\n24\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.125\nWell, I'm gonna be animating this,\nhow I do that?\n\n25\n00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.730\nAnd also what do I need to know about\nthe ball in order to render the ball?\n\n26\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.717\nSo kind of the broad\ncategories that I have,\n\n27\n00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:27.700\nI need an update function, how is the\nstate of the ball going to change, right.\n\n28\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.040\nIf we had a ball here,\nits position is changing,\n\n29\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.480\nis its size changing?No,\nis its speed possibly changing?\n\n30\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.550\nProbably not here,\nwe could do that Is it's color changing?\n\n31\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.900\nNo, probably not, but its position is,\nand its position in an x and y direction.\n\n32\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.660\nNow you're like what is he doing?\n\n33\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.820\nWell, I'm just relative imagine,\nkind of close your eyes and imagine and\n\n34\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.150\nthen definitely come back and take\na look at all this but we have the ball.\n\n35\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.600\nWe need the ability to update\nsomething about it, and\n\n36\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.370\nwe need the ability to,\nwhat else do we need?\n\n37\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.085\nWe need to render to the string, and\n\n38\n00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:12.920\nthen rendering is going to be dependent\non the data that we kind of store.\n\n39\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.110\nSo, update and render,\nare either going to use the data for\n\n40\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.500\nrender in order to actually render it, and\nthen that method is going to render it.\n\n41\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.770\nOr update is going to modify or\nmutate that data, so\n\n42\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.120\nthen the next render knows what to do.\n\n43\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680\nSo it's kind of this weird tangled\nmess of data, update and render.\n\n44\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.350\n&gt;&gt; And don't we have to also ascribe some\nrandom attributes to it as well and?\n\n45\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.210\n&gt;&gt; And we will have some random attributes\nand that's part of our data portion.\n\n46\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.289\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But some of that will be built\n\n47\n00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.340\nin inside of creating a ball.\n\n48\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.514\nSo, we're talking very\n10,000 foot view here,\n\n49\n00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:54.438\nI think we're probably best just to\ngo ahead and get it done, right?\n\n50\n00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:56.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And try to get it up and going.\n\n51\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.690\nNow, I'm gonna built this piece by piece.\n\n52\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.230\nSo we can see the individual elements at\nwork that were be periodically rattle and\n\n53\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.396\ncome back and say,\nlets change this around.\n\n54\n00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of move forward,\n\n55\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.530\nmake it better.\n\n56\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.860\nMove forward, make it better\nkind of iterative process, so\n\n57\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.690\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n58\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.699\nSo was gonna take a look at my screen and\nfrom the previous episode,\n\n59\n00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.971\nwe have our basic setup,\nwe have our src app.js.\n\n60\n00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.745\nAnd then our app.js is here and\n\n61\n00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:26.557\nwe may have to turn this off,\nbut for now we're good.\n\n62\n00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:30.600\nOkay, now in order to render,\n\n63\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.110\nI need a rendering context.\n\n64\n00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.010\nSo I'm gonna say getContext ( '2d').\n\n65\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.480\nNow these are all 2d planer type\nthings that are gonna move and\n\n66\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.640\nmay give the illusion of 3D based\non the layers that are depended on.\n\n67\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.960\nHowever, we're not getting crazy 3D\nlike WebGL or anything like that.\n\n68\n00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.540\nSo I'm gonna grab that and\nI'm gonna use that.\n\n69\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.201\nNow, I could do all of\nthe ball stuff in here.\n\n70\n00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n71\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.353\n&gt;&gt; I may start there but\n\n72\n00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:05.119\neventually I'm going to pull\nthis out into a separate file.\n\n73\n00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:10.140\nTo keep app.js, that is only kind of\nthe running logic what is going on.\n\n74\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n75\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in order to do that, I'm going\nto separate this portion here maybe.\n\n76\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.690\nThere we go.\n\n77\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.010\nAnd then boom, End of Ball, like so.\n\n78\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.725\nSo between these two pieces,\nI'm actually going to do the ball portion.\n\n79\n00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:35.230\n[COUGH] Now along this way we'll have\nto add some functions, take them away.\n\n80\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.730\nBut what do I need for a ball?\n\n81\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.720\nAt the very minimum, at the very minimum,\n\n82\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.440\nI need that little bit of data,\nabate, render, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.361\nSo, I'm gonna create the ball,\nas I'm probably gonna need one,\n\n84\n00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:53.659\nso I'm gonna use an object literal.\n\n85\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.560\nYou may be going well,\nwhat if you want multiple, well,\n\n86\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.720\nwe could always come back and change this,\nbut our ball is an object literal.\n\n87\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.700\nSo what do we need, we need the x\nposition, and what is the x position?\n\n88\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.470\nAnd that's the canvas width divided by 2,\nand\n\n89\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.578\nthen the y position is\nthe canvas height divided by 2.\n\n90\n00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:18.978\nAnd notice l'm using this global variable,\nlet's gonna [INAUDIBLE],\n\n91\n00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:20.972\nwe may definitely change that.\n\n92\n00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:25.411\nAd then let's see,\nl mean how fast it's going,\n\n93\n00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:30.180\nlet's just say 10, let's just guess at it.\n\n94\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.430\nAnd then dy we'll say 5,\nnow I'm thinking of\n\n95\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.350\n5 pixels per animation, so\nto move 5 pixels every time.\n\n96\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.750\nIf that's 60 frames a second, that has\nactually moving at a pretty good clip.\n\n97\n00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.880\nWhat else defines a ball?\n\n98\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.820\nWell, let's see.\n\n99\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.940\nI'd probably need a size or\nradius or right,\n\n100\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.140\nsoft ball, and a basketball, and\na soccer ball, and a racket ball.\n\n101\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.730\nThey're all different sizes.\n\n102\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.160\nSo think about what defines a ball.\n\n103\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.230\nWell, ping pong balls fairly small,\nbut it still does have a size.\n\n104\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.220\nIn particular,\nwe're gonna be talking about the radius.\n\n105\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.130\nSo the radius, and this may change.\n\n106\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.750\nMaybe it would be better to have a more\ngeneral description like sides, right?\n\n107\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.070\nAnd then for a circular object,\nthat would be the radius.\n\n108\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.020\nFor some other object,\nthat might not be the case.\n\n109\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.430\nAnd let's just make this,\nthat's kind of huge, 20 pixels.\n\n110\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.418\nAnd then the color,\nthose are typically white, however,\n\n111\n00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:41.406\nl have a white background now, so\nwhich is your favorite color [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n112\n00:06:41.406 --> 00:06:42.025\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n113\n00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:46.260\nwe're gonna go with blue, blue it is,\nand we can always trick that.\n\n114\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.397\nWe're hard coding these values just\nto get an idea of what is going on.\n\n115\n00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:54.012\nNow, l'm gonna use an update function and\nthis is new short hand syntax, and\n\n116\n00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.579\na render, and I'm gonna use convection.\n\n117\n00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:59.832\nI don't have to do this, this is just,\nI may come back and change this or\n\n118\n00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:00.604\nreorganize it.\n\n119\n00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:03.790\nI'm always gonna pass in a context\nthat's gonna be rendering,\n\n120\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.568\nthat way I can render this ball\nin context that I want to.\n\n121\n00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:08.990\nAnd it's not tied to a particular context.\n\n122\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.350\nI could technically store that\nas a property in the ball, but\n\n123\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.530\nI want the data to be explicit\nto just describing the ball.\n\n124\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.550\nBecause we're gonna have to probably\nchange some of this around.\n\n125\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.390\nSo, what is update gonna do?\n\n126\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.818\nWell, every time I call update,\nI wanna take the position, x and y,\n\n127\n00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:34.206\nand move it by some change in time,\ntimes how fast it was moving, right.\n\n128\n00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:35.650\nI'm going 60 mph.\n\n129\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.560\nIn one hour, I have moved 60 miles.\n\n130\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.160\nSo I'm doing these manipulations.\n\n131\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.650\nIf you're like,\nit feels like math and physics,\n\n132\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.330\nthis is we're gonna assume that\nthe time limit is always one, right?\n\n133\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.863\nI'm moving 60 miles an hour and\n\n134\n00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:53.398\nI'll always ask you how fast\nare you going in one hour?\n\n135\n00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:54.105\nIt's 60.\n\n136\n00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:57.510\nIf you went 30 miles per hour,\nhow long does it take you in one hour?\n\n137\n00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.445\n30, we're always going to use a singular\nunit, like a unit value of one,\n\n138\n00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:04.720\nas our animation table, so\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n139\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.950\nWe may have to tweak that depending\non performance and things.\n\n140\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.090\nBut it's gonna be our assumption.\n\n141\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.800\nLikewise that's gonna make this\nchange because our position is xy,\n\n142\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.490\nhow much they're changing every\ntime the clock ticks is the dx, dy.\n\n143\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.680\n&gt;&gt; Certainly that makes sense.\n\n144\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.706\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; Plus this.dx and this.y plus dy.\n\n145\n00:08:29.706 --> 00:08:31.860\nNow, this is isn't anything new.\n\n146\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.590\nWe'll just getting things set up.\n\n147\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.357\nReally where it comes is when\npaddles bounce off of each other and\n\n148\n00:08:37.357 --> 00:08:39.410\nmaking the paddle automated.\n\n149\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.154\nBut we have to start at the ground,\nhow do I go about this,\n\n150\n00:08:43.154 --> 00:08:45.583\nand then a render, how do we render?\n\n151\n00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:48.790\nWell, our ball is circular,\nso we're gonna use-\n\n152\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.955\n&gt;&gt; Just gonna ask you that,\n\n153\n00:08:49.955 --> 00:08:52.630\nare you gonna call on spheroid,\nor what are you gonna do?\n\n154\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.170\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna with a circular ball but\n\n155\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.490\nthat kind of brings up a good point\nthat I should probably touch on.\n\n156\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.610\nDoes it have to be circular?\n\n157\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.940\nCould you play ping pong\nwith a pentagonal ball?\n\n158\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.745\nYou could, you get weird bounce dynamics.\n\n159\n00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:09.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n160\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.290\n&gt;&gt; I will say this,\n\n161\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.800\ncircular items are easier to reason about\nbecause the positions that they occupy and\n\n162\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.020\ndetecting collisions\nare uniform from everywhere.\n\n163\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.580\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly.\n\n164\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.270\n&gt;&gt; So\nif I had something that was a square,\n\n165\n00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.410\nif the tip hit, that's actually a longer\ndistance that I have to account for.\n\n166\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.690\nSo I have to account for how it's rotated,\nversus, it's just this far away, right?\n\n167\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.830\nSo I tend to go with circular\nobjects when possible.\n\n168\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.780\nIt's not always possible depending\non what you're trying to do.\n\n169\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.130\nSo we're going to draw a circular object,\nnow.\n\n170\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.780\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n171\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:49.610\nWe're gonna use this ctx.save() and\nctx.restore() like so, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.650\nAnd that way the context always goes back\nto it's previous state if it's passed in.\n\n173\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.177\nAnd we're going to beginPath() like so,\n\n174\n00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:04.920\nand hit Enter a bunch of times.\n\n175\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.670\nAnd then closePath.\n\n176\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.500\nBut there's a few things\nthat I need to do.\n\n177\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.928\nWell I need the fillColor or the fillStyle\nbe equal to the ball's color.\n\n178\n00:10:14.928 --> 00:10:19.470\nNow, this keyword even in this object\nliteral is referring to this ball,\n\n179\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.590\nthis particular one.\n\n180\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.630\nNow what about the radius?\n\n181\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.230\nWell that will come into play here.\n\n182\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:35.466\nAnd let's see, I need arc() and\nthat's going to take a position.\n\n183\n00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:38.072\nNo, what is the position?\n\n184\n00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:42.396\nWell it's this.x, this.y and\n\n185\n00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:48.427\nthis.radius, And from 0 to Math.PI * 2.\n\n186\n00:10:48.427 --> 00:10:52.517\nNow that says,\ngo all the way around the circle, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:58.040\nSo 0 to Math.PI * 2 that's almost\nalways there for a full circle.\n\n188\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.460\nSo we're almost going to ignore that.\n\n189\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.013\nI may come back and change that to\nmake it little more readable but\n\n190\n00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:04.384\nwe're gonna go that direction for\n\n191\n00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:07.760\nnow, and apparently I accidentally\nhit a three finger swipe there.\n\n192\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.390\nAnd then I'm going to say, fill.\n\n193\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.300\nIf you don't actually do that then\nyou never actually fill the ball.\n\n194\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.110\nIt'll never draw.\n\n195\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.550\nIt'll do a bunch of stuff,\nbut it'll never draw.\n\n196\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.700\nAnd so\nthis is our first iteration of the ball.\n\n197\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.098\nThere's a couple of things\nthat I wanna point out.\n\n198\n00:11:26.098 --> 00:11:28.480\nCanvas width.\n\n199\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.205\n[SOUND] It's using the canvas\nhere global variable and\n\n200\n00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:37.834\nthat means that this is\ncoupled to that canvas only.\n\n201\n00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:39.870\nWe will deal with that later.\n\n202\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.110\nWe have some hard coded values.\n\n203\n00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.750\nYou are eventually gonna have some hard\ncoded values but what if I wanted to make\n\n204\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.449\nthe ball different sized based\non different [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n205\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.240\nNow this is gonna become problematic,\nwhat if I wanted the character or\n\n206\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.250\nthe player to select the ball color,\nor like a theme?\n\n207\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.410\nThis becomes more difficult.\n\n208\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.430\n&gt;&gt; Or like in the actual game as I recall,\nas you're playing it starts to speed up.\n\n209\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.560\n&gt;&gt; So actually changing the speed.\n\n210\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.490\nThese are all hard coded.\n\n211\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.340\nYou're absolutely correct.\n\n212\n00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.410\nI may run into problems later and\nhere's where people will get crazy.\n\n213\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.610\nThey try to make this\ntoo abstract too soon.\n\n214\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.900\nAnd then it becomes hard to reason about.\n\n215\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.110\nI'm just gonna leave it here for\nnow and then we can always come back.\n\n216\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.660\n&gt;&gt; And tweak it.\n\n217\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.970\n&gt;&gt; And tweak it and refactor and\n\n218\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.380\nmake it better and so\n[COUGH] I'm gonna leave that here for now.\n\n219\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.520\nAnd I wanna make sure that it works.\n\n220\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.540\nSo we have the context,\nwe have a full sized canvas.\n\n221\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.550\nWe have the ball object.\n\n222\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:40.900\nIf I call, ball.render(ctx) like that.\n\n223\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.690\nWhat ball is it?\n\n224\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.810\nIt's this one right here.\n\n225\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.640\nAnd I refresh, there it is.\n\n226\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.870\nThere is the ball, and\n\n227\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.500\nsee you have to handle the resize\nof things appropriately.\n\n228\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.120\nIn addition to you'll notice something.\n\n229\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.790\nIf I refresh, refresh, and\nthen if I move this refresh,\n\n230\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.020\nthe refresh will actually\nresize based on this.\n\n231\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.047\nBut it will not resize the window,\nwe can do that later,\n\n232\n00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:14.310\nwe'll figure that out,\nthat's not my ultimate concern.\n\n233\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.870\nSo we're refreshing,\nwe're good, but if I go ball,\n\n234\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.650\nupdate, notice ball update ran,\n\n235\n00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:29.890\nand if I say ball render, I'm doing\na little bit of exploration console.\n\n236\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.900\nNotice I drew the ball again.\n\n237\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.420\nAnd if I do that one more time,\nand I drew the ball again.\n\n238\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.400\nI then clear the screen but\nI can manually do this, so\n\n239\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.120\nit looks like our ball's working and\n\n240\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.660\nwe've done some manual testing, let's\nsee if it can actually animates, right.\n\n241\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.540\nSo if we come here, and\n\n242\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.320\ndown here are some kind of\nmain portions of our app.\n\n243\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.300\nWe're going to say const main = and\nthere we go okay?\n\n244\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.050\nNow we may change this but\nthis is a good approximation.\n\n245\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.200\nFirst I'm gonna say\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame,\n\n246\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.130\nand we technically don't\nhave to do window.\n\n247\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.640\nSo just to keep the typing down,\nrequestAnimationFrame.\n\n248\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.450\nAnd what am I gonna call?\n\n249\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.910\nWell I'm gonna call this function.\n\n250\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.650\nAnd now okay what do I want ball.update,\n\n251\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:31.060\nand ball.render.\n\n252\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.930\nAnd I gotta pass in the context, and\nI'm gonna remove this render here,\n\n253\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.460\ncuz I don't actually need that, and\nI'm constructed a ball, I'm now passing it\n\n254\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:43.610\nover to essentially this app.js is\nthe game state, the game that's going on.\n\n255\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.850\nAnd now to kick it off,\nrequestAnimationFrame(main).\n\n256\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.470\nSo give me the first one and then that\none will continue to schedule next, next,\n\n257\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.970\nnext.\n\n258\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.734\nAnd so if I refresh, there it is,\nwe now have a moving path.\n\n259\n00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:01.888\nAnd you're like it's nothing new,\nyou've talked about that before, yeah,\n\n260\n00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:03.640\nI have I'm not gonna lie to you.\n\n261\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.824\n&gt;&gt; And there's trails.\n\n262\n00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:08.320\n&gt;&gt; And there's trails, so\nwe should probably fix that trail first.\n\n263\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.150\nSo ctx.fillReact For 0,0,\n\n264\n00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.990\ncanvas.width, canvas.height.\n\n265\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.272\nAnd you're like,\nyou're using these global variables again.\n\n266\n00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:26.368\nI am, and the reason I'm doing that\nis because within this game state,\n\n267\n00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:28.570\nI should have access to the games.\n\n268\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.820\nThe game should be all knowing,\nkind of this onmi present type thing.\n\n269\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Could be a macroverse.\n\n270\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.390\nThere we go.\nAnd then I'm going to restore and\n\n272\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:44.861\nthat way any changes I make in this\ncontext will not persist beyond that.\n\n273\n00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:49.959\nAnd I'm just gonna say rgba(255,\n\n274\n00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:56.146\n255, 255); Now 5 key is not working.\n\n275\n00:15:56.146 --> 00:15:59.554\nIt just stopped working, there we go, 0.3.\n\n276\n00:15:59.554 --> 00:16:00.818\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, good.\n\n277\n00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:02.304\n&gt;&gt; There you go, right.\n\n278\n00:16:02.304 --> 00:16:04.088\n&gt;&gt; So we get 40 over here [LAUGH].\n\n279\n00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.535\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna have, got to love it.\n\n280\n00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:11.836\nBut now, I'm gonna get a semi transparent\nfield that would eventually kind diminish\n\n281\n00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.593\nthe trail, and\nwe should get this nice ball movement.\n\n282\n00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n283\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.611\n&gt;&gt; That's great, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:18.331\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n285\n00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Now, here's the thing,\n\n286\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.090\nthis will always move and\nnever do anything.\n\n287\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.300\nI actually want it to hit the edge.\n\n288\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.750\nI want it to hit the edge and\nthen reset the game.\n\n289\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, because it just flew\noff into infinity, didn't it.\n\n290\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.531\n&gt;&gt; Right,it did, but when it hits the top\nand bottom, I actually want it to bounce.\n\n291\n00:16:40.531 --> 00:16:42.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n292\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.910\n&gt;&gt; So, what we probably need\nto do is check there and\n\n293\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.980\nmake that internal to the ball but\nthen have the game manage [INAUDIBLE]\n\n294\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.850\nthe balls out of balance, we;re just\ngonna reset the game and start over.\n\n295\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.820\nOkay, so\n\n296\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.180\nwhat we gonna do is say,\n\n297\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.230\nsome of that logic should\nprobably just in the game, so\n\n298\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:15.770\nwe're gonna update, render, but\nbefore we do this, check some conditions.\n\n299\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.420\nAnd there's a couple of different ways,\nI'm gonna do this the game may be that it\n\n300\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.530\nends up fitting in the and\nthe ball object better.\n\n301\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.975\nBut we're gonna keep that here,\nand check some conditions.\n\n302\n00:17:26.975 --> 00:17:32.001\nIf(ball.y), if the y\n\n303\n00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:37.984\nposition is &lt; canvas) It's\n\n304\n00:17:37.984 --> 00:17:43.978\n&lt; ball.radius), right?\n\n305\n00:17:43.978 --> 00:17:50.151\nSo I went to the top and I came down the\nradius of the ball, it was less than that.\n\n306\n00:17:50.151 --> 00:17:54.977\nOr ball.x &gt; canvas.width, nope, nope,\n\n307\n00:17:54.977 --> 00:17:59.676\nsee I wanna bounce it off the left and\nright,\n\n308\n00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:03.810\nit's up and down, up and down.\n\n309\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:09.448\nIf it's greater than the canvas\nheight minus the ball radius,\n\n310\n00:18:09.448 --> 00:18:12.270\nthen do something.\n\n311\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:18.700\nOkay, and that means I came to the bottom\nand then came up actual ball amount.\n\n312\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.086\nSo I'm testing to see if the center is\nhere and then it will bounce up and down,\n\n313\n00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:25.664\nhowever, it will not bounce left and\nright.\n\n314\n00:18:25.664 --> 00:18:28.180\nSo [COUGH] we're gonna\ncheck some conditions.\n\n315\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:35.177\nSo let's call it bounce top and\n\n316\n00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:40.560\nbottom, and reset game\n\n317\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.840\nif out of bounds, right?\n\n318\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.997\nIf out of bounds.\n\n319\n00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:55.669\nSo we're doing this a little bit to\ntest and make sure and get a feel,\n\n320\n00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:58.730\nmake sure we have all we need for\nthe ball.\n\n321\n00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.100\nSo if it's here, what do I want?\n\n322\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:08.520\nI want the ball to bounce in\nthe y direction, or up and down.\n\n323\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.430\nSo I want it to boop, boop, boop.\n\n324\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:17.532\nSo that part is probably best In the ball,\nso boom, bounceY and\n\n325\n00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:23.170\nI'm just adding a method\nbecause it makes sense.\n\n326\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:23.695\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n327\n00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:30.600\n&gt;&gt; So this.dy = -1 times this.dy.\n\n328\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.340\nSo change its velocity up and down.\n\n329\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:42.071\nSo if this is true, then, ball.bounceY.\n\n330\n00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:44.220\nAnd by doing these methods,\nwhat is the ball doing?\n\n331\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.870\nIt's bouncing in the Y direction, and\nit's bouncing off the top and bottom.\n\n332\n00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.943\nWe can change the name later, but\n\n333\n00:19:51.943 --> 00:19:59.521\njust to keep things a little bit quicker,\nhere we go and boom.\n\n334\n00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:05.232\nWe're gonna change this to an x,\nthis to an x and this to a width.\n\n335\n00:20:05.232 --> 00:20:08.450\nAll right, there's technically a zero\nhere cuz we moved over from the left and\n\n336\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.770\nfrom the top.\n\n337\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.530\nBut if that's true,\nthen what are we gonna do?\n\n338\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.600\nWe don't actually have any\nway to reset the ball,\n\n339\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.260\nwe'd have to do this all manually.\n\n340\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.490\nSo, this object literal may\nnot only need one ball.\n\n341\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.070\nWell actually,\n\n342\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.410\nwhat you probably need is the ability\nto create multiple balls, right?\n\n343\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.090\nAnd you may have multiple ping pong balls.\n\n344\n00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.180\nSo if we want to do that,\nwhat should we do?\n\n345\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.660\nFor now I'm gonna simulate something.\n\n346\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.703\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna say oldBall = {}; and\n\n347\n00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:51.724\nI'm just gonna say Object.assign [],\n\n348\n00:20:51.724 --> 00:20:54.390\nthis is fairly named.\n\n349\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.440\nAnd what is the target?\n\n350\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.129\nWell, I wanna copy the oldBall\n\n351\n00:21:03.446 --> 00:21:06.102\nThere we go,\nI was putting it in the wrong place.\n\n352\n00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:10.902\nWanna put it into a new object,\n\n353\n00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:15.350\nwanna copy the ball that I\njust made into this object.\n\n354\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.680\nAnd now I have this backup copy,\nI have this backup copy.\n\n355\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.740\n&gt;&gt; It's too bad there's not\na clone feature, a clone call.\n\n356\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.358\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, this is a clone call.\n\n357\n00:21:27.358 --> 00:21:29.232\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if I give it an empty object, and\n\n358\n00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:32.990\nthen I give it another [INAUDIBLE],\nand it'll just copy that over, and\n\n359\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.950\nit's a clone of the original.\n\n360\n00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.840\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; They are no longer linked.\n\n361\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.420\nSo I'm gonna keep a backup copy.\n\n362\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.530\nAnd now if this occurs,\nwhat do I wanna do?\n\n363\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.883\nI want to just actually make the ball,\n\n364\n00:21:47.883 --> 00:21:54.287\nwhich I can't because now I\nneed to change this to a let.\n\n365\n00:21:54.287 --> 00:21:59.100\nI wanna make the ball have the same\nproperties as it originally did.\n\n366\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.700\nAnd I'll show you here.\n\n367\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.160\nThis is not the best, but\nthis is a good approximation.\n\n368\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.782\nWe'll definitely come back and\nchange this.\n\n369\n00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:08.470\nI'm gonna change the ball\nback to the old ball.\n\n370\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.200\nSo, what this does is take all\nthe attributes that are copied up here\n\n371\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.610\nfrom its original state and\nputs it back in.\n\n372\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.940\nSo it should return their\nrespective positions.\n\n373\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.030\nSo if I do this, and boom, boom, boom.\n\n374\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.510\n&gt;&gt; There is clones.\n\n375\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, clones.\n\n376\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.800\nSo this is mutation and a lot of\npeople are like I don't like mutating.\n\n377\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.578\nHowever, I now only have two objects\nthat I can use to reset the game instead\n\n378\n00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:41.000\nof spawning 5,000 ping pong balls,\nwhich could cause some performance issues.\n\n379\n00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.060\nHowever, we know that this works.\n\n380\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.411\nBut now we need to tweak,\nwhat happens if I change this to negative?\n\n381\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.910\nIt still works, cool.\n\n382\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:57.156\nWhat if this is 0, so\nit never moves left to right but\n\n383\n00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:59.791\nit only moves up and down?\n\n384\n00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:02.121\nAnd wait, [LAUGH].\n\n385\n00:23:02.121 --> 00:23:06.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so we now have that,\n\n386\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.743\nthat probably needs to\nbe a little bit faster.\n\n387\n00:23:11.275 --> 00:23:15.020\nBoom, boom,\n&gt;&gt; Now that's a bit of a challenge.\n\n388\n00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.434\n&gt;&gt; So now, yeah,\nthis game will go on forever.\n\n389\n00:23:18.434 --> 00:23:19.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n390\n00:23:19.675 --> 00:23:23.450\nthose are some things that we have observe\nthat we'll definitely have to address.\n\n391\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.760\nSo I reset a game on the outer edges,\nthat works.\n\n392\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n393\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.963\n&gt;&gt; We will definite refactor that,\nbut our ball has all\n\n394\n00:23:32.963 --> 00:23:38.682\nthe attributes necessary to self\ndescribe what needs to happen.\n\n395\n00:23:38.682 --> 00:23:39.247\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n396\n00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, update, things to that nature.\n\n397\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.805\nI do have some logic.\n\n398\n00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:47.941\nThat's right down here on a game\nthat why are we doing it.\n\n399\n00:23:47.941 --> 00:23:51.709\nWell, this will become more\napparent when this starts,\n\n400\n00:23:51.709 --> 00:23:56.029\nit's no longer a function and\nactually becomes something else.\n\n401\n00:23:56.029 --> 00:24:01.064\nSo, one last thing I do wanna do It's\n\n402\n00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:05.621\nprobably best if I pull this out.\n\n403\n00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:06.641\nReally I would use,\n\n404\n00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:10.481\nif I was building something like this I\nwould use something like web pack, or\n\n405\n00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:14.070\noffer some module bundling and\njust to help with this pattern.\n\n406\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.640\nBut for now we're gonna forego that,\nthat's a little too much.\n\n407\n00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.733\nThis app.js should only be main logic,\nshould be essentially our game.\n\n408\n00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:23.120\n&gt;&gt; The game state you said.\n\n409\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, what the game's doing,\n\n410\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.630\nhowever the game needs to know\nabout these other things.\n\n411\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.530\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create\na js file inside of this js folder,\n\n412\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.478\ncalled ball.js.\n\n413\n00:24:36.478 --> 00:24:38.050\nNow this will change overtime,\n\n414\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.640\nI'm just gonna paste this for\nnow and then there's our ball.\n\n415\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.490\nSo now the only thing in\nthis file is ball related.\n\n416\n00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.770\nSo something goes wrong with the ball\nlike data and like update file,\n\n417\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.908\nyou just come to this file, you don't\nhave to worry about all that other stuff.\n\n418\n00:24:53.908 --> 00:24:56.921\nHowever this did break my game.\n\n419\n00:24:56.921 --> 00:24:57.970\nWhy?\n\n420\n00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.930\nThat's because now, in order to have\nthese dependencies load appropriately,\n\n421\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.760\nI have to come back and\nadd another script like so.\n\n422\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.310\nNow, Adam, you kinda get that Tab feature.\n\n423\n00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.550\nI'm hitting Tab to auto complete for\nfree, src=ball.js\n\n424\n00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.590\nthat will still be broken because it's\nactually in a folder, js/ball,js.\n\n425\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:23.400\nWhen I come back that should canvas\nis not, we just ran into a problem.\n\n426\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.970\nDid we not?\n\n427\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.800\nSo canvas is here.\n\n428\n00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.390\nThe ball is necessary.\n\n429\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.910\nSo what should I do?\n\n430\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.240\nThe ball, the app, so\ninside a ball I use canvas right here.\n\n431\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:50.497\nFor now,\nlet's just place it at roughly 500,500.\n\n432\n00:25:50.497 --> 00:25:53.261\nMy 5 key legitimately,\n\n433\n00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:58.820\nI guess we're gonna go 600, and then 600.\n\n434\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.190\nAnd let's see if we have canvas.\n\n435\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.025\nAny other place?\n\n436\n00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:02.550\nNo, that's it.\n\n437\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.610\nSo there was weird dependency issue.\n\n438\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.706\nReally the ball should be fed in\nthe canvas and constructed but\n\n439\n00:26:09.706 --> 00:26:10.955\nwe're using a literal.\n\n440\n00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:13.050\nWe'll definitely come back and\nrefactor that.\n\n441\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.590\nBut I wanted to show you, there we go,\nwe now have our ball back.\n\n442\n00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.616\nAnd if it were to run off the edge, right?\n\n443\n00:26:21.616 --> 00:26:28.499\nLet's change this to 20, [SOUND],\nThat's pretty good serve in Pong.\n\n444\n00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:32.427\nBut now we're good,\nwe see the illusion of motion,\n\n445\n00:26:32.427 --> 00:26:37.420\nour ball at least in it's first form,\nwe're ready to go Zach.\n\n446\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.020\nWe got some paddles and\nscores, and difficulties,\n\n447\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.860\nand there's a lot more to this,\nso definitely stay tuned.\n\n448\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.603\nBut this does provide an impetuous\nof why would I care about anime?\n\n449\n00:26:46.603 --> 00:26:49.020\nWell I wanna build something like this.\n\n450\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.701\n&gt;&gt; It's exciting and\nyou're doing a marvelous job.\n\n451\n00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:54.980\nAnd creating the ball, love this episode,\nand there's so much more to come.\n\n452\n00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.390\nAnything else you'd like to add?\n\n453\n00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.470\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna address some\nof these dependencies and\n\n454\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:04.210\nhow does, there's this weird circular\nmotion in app and the ball right now.\n\n455\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.940\nUltimately what we're gonna do is build\nfunctions inside a ball that will\n\n456\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:14.760\nconstruct balls from a function call,\nthat the app can use internal to itself.\n\n457\n00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.850\nSo it's gonna become the stateful thing,\nonly inside of the application.\n\n458\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.710\nSo there's still some weirdness, but I'm\na big proponent of let patterns emerge,\n\n459\n00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.960\nkind of figure out what's going on,\n\n460\n00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.090\nbefore you start imposing all these\ndesign patterns or these things.\n\n461\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.190\nNow, I may not have been\nvery explicit about that in\n\n462\n00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.560\nother times that I've spoken.\n\n463\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.870\nBut I think when you're first learning,\nfirst experimenting,\n\n464\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.726\nthat's probably a best practice or\nat least it makes sense to me.\n\n465\n00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:47.990\nSo opinion based, but we're gonna do that,\nso definitely come back and\n\n466\n00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.010\nsee how I do it.\n\n467\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.740\nMaybe you disagree,\nthat's completely okay.\n\n468\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.140\n&gt;&gt; You're doing a fantastic job\nJustin you're an awesome teacher,\n\n469\n00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.420\nand we're taking those baby pawn steps.\n\n470\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.253\nSo make sure you watch every single\nepisode of HTML 5 Canvas Projects.\n\n471\n00:27:59.253 --> 00:28:02.900\nAnd while you're at it, go to our course\nlibrary and check out the hundreds of\n\n472\n00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.780\nvideos that are there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n473\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.794\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n474\n00:28:08.794 --> 00:28:10.450\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n475\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.180\n&gt;&gt;

go.\n\n3\n00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.140\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n4\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.660\nAs we continue on with\nHTML 5 Canvas Projects,\n\n5\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.830\nwe're gonna be creating a paddle today,\nin our homage to pong.\n\n6\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.249\nAnd the person we need for this is\nJustin Dennison right here, hey Justin,\n\n7\n00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.615\nthanks for joining us again.\n\n8\n00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.747\n&gt;&gt; I am glad to be back, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:33.157\nI'm glad that I'm needed because well-\n&gt;&gt; You are.\n\n10\n00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:35.170\n&gt;&gt; That keeps me kind of in focus.\n\n11\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.970\nBut more importantly Zach,\nhow are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.471\n&gt;&gt; I am thrilled, I'm feeling thrilled.\n\n13\n00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:46.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so we're gonna go\nahead and talk about that paddle.\n\n14\n00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.995\nI don't know how to take that thrill.\n\n15\n00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:49.960\n&gt;&gt; We're making a paddle.\n\n16\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.138\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it was thrilled.\n\n17\n00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:51.877\n&gt;&gt; And a ball.\n\n18\n00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:55.600\n&gt;&gt; We are making a paddle, and\nI'm glad you said in our homage to pong.\n\n19\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.290\nMainly, because if we're just\nmaking a paddle it could be for\n\n20\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.530\na whole plethora of uses, right?\n\n21\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.310\nLike, making a paddle?\n\n22\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.920\nWhy would you need a paddle?\n\n23\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.420\nBut what I'm talking about is\nthe ping pong paddles, right?\n\n24\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.110\nThe little bars on either\nside that need to have-\n\n25\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.961\n&gt;&gt; And I have a question, too.\n\n26\n00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:09.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is the paddle creation,\n\n27\n00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.085\nis that gonna be different\nthan how we created the ball?\n\n28\n00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:13.556\n&gt;&gt; So there is gonna be some differences.\n\n29\n00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:17.965\nWe're gonna have, namely the paddle I\nthink is gonna best a rectangular shape.\n\n30\n00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:22.135\nSo that in itself has a different\n\n31\n00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:25.875\nkind of set of coordinates that\ndescribe it than the ball does.\n\n32\n00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.595\nNow, we could apply some\nabstractions to get around that,\n\n33\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.910\nI'm a big fan of don't apply\nearly abstractions if possible.\n\n34\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.088\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; You should know about them, but\n\n35\n00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.867\nwhen you're actually building something-\n&gt;&gt; You'd go back and then later build up,\n\n36\n00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:38.370\nbuild on it.\n\n37\n00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we can always pull\nthose out and abstract those.\n\n38\n00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:45.740\nSo I'm actually going to use\na similar type approach to the ball.\n\n39\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.780\nBut let's think about it, a paddle needs\nwhere it's located within height, right?\n\n40\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.080\nNot just a radius.\n\n41\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.240\nBecause our paddle is a square.\n\n42\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.530\nIt actually has uneven distribution\nof side length, within height.\n\n43\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.890\nBut it does still have a color.\n\n44\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.955\nDoes still have a position.\n\n45\n00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:05.730\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The position is just a little bit\n\n46\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.220\ndifferent than say the ball is.\n\n47\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.570\nSo yeah, that's where we're going.\n\n48\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.650\nBut we still are going to store data\ninside of a paddle object very,\n\n49\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.856\nsimilar that we did with the ball, right?\n\n50\n00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:20.748\n&gt;&gt; So-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have to,\n\n51\n00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:22.580\nbecause it's gonna have attributes.\n\n52\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, it needs those attributes,\nit also needs those functions.\n\n53\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.390\nAnd we are going to start applying\nan API that I'm coming up with and\n\n54\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.610\nI'm not saying it is the best one.\n\n55\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.260\nNow, what do I mean with API?\n\n56\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.380\nWell, the actual programming interface for\n\n57\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.780\nthe objects that we're\nbuilding to be on the screen.\n\n58\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.050\nI like to keep those as\nuniform as possible.\n\n59\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.110\nEspecially if I need this.\n\n60\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.320\nNow, there are times where\nwe have to break those.\n\n61\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.309\nI'm a big proponent of, get things working\nand then come back and make them better.\n\n62\n00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n63\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.290\n&gt;&gt; But\nin order to kind of think about this,\n\n64\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.820\nI wanna be very explicit about\nthe planning and the thought process.\n\n65\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.982\nSo l think is best if we\ncome back to our plan,\n\n66\n00:02:56.982 --> 00:02:59.900\nour drawn plan from the previous episodes.\n\n67\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.830\nAnd then kind of address like what do we\nneed, what are the things that we need in\n\n68\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.980\norder to describe a paddle that would be\nused for rendering as well as updating?\n\n69\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.740\nNow, I just said two verbs, render and\nupdate, the ball actually had a render and\n\n70\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.770\nupdate, and\nthat's part of that API that I'm picking\n\n71\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.000\nin order to kind of keep things together,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.340\nWe're always gonna have\nan update function,\n\n73\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.360\nwe're always gonna have a render, but\n\n74\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.570\nthat doesn't mean that we can't kind\nof break the mold a little bit.\n\n75\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.050\nYou never know what\nthings are going to do.\n\n76\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.637\nSo let's go ahead and come over to the\nskycam and just look at our previous plan.\n\n77\n00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:36.731\nAnd here's our plan and you know we\nstarted out with this ball that can move\n\n78\n00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:40.540\nin a multitude of directions and\nit can bounce against the paddles.\n\n79\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.929\nNow, that's not ultimately what we're\ngonna try to do in this episode.\n\n80\n00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.620\nWell in order to play pong or\nan homage to pong,\n\n81\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.038\nwe definitely have to do that eventually.\n\n82\n00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:55.650\nBut what I'm thinking is we\njust look at this, right?\n\n83\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.160\nSo if I come back to my\nplan here's my paddle.\n\n84\n00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.200\nAnd notice this is actually gonna be\nthe player paddle, we're on the left.\n\n85\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.010\nBut for now we just want a general paddle.\n\n86\n00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.339\nBecause if I can make a paddle here and\nI can make a paddle here,\n\n87\n00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:07.939\nthen I can just kinda go okay,\n\n88\n00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.120\nwhat changes do I need to make in order\nto have a player and a computer, right?\n\n89\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.850\nOr maybe I don't need any changes.\n\n90\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.860\nMaybe it just comes out that\nthe paddle is already descriptive and\n\n91\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.990\nthen I just change it to the other one,\nmake a few tweaks.\n\n92\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.040\nSo what do I need in\norder to describe this?\n\n93\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.410\nWell, I'm gonna draw just\na little bit more on this.\n\n94\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.700\nActually let me grab\na different color here.\n\n95\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.350\nAnd so I have this,\nwhat we call height, right?\n\n96\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.880\nSo that's an attribute that we need.\n\n97\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.768\nAnd then I have also a width And\nI know I'm drawing over some things,\n\n98\n00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:49.819\nand that's kinda hard to read, but\nthat actually says width, I promise.\n\n99\n00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.560\nAnd then well we have a color right?\n\n100\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.921\nAnd we should probably be\nable to set the color.\n\n101\n00:04:54.921 --> 00:04:56.100\nSo we need a color.\n\n102\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.610\nAnd then we also need an x, y right,\nour positioning, our coordinate system.\n\n103\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.500\nNow, when we're drawing rectangles is\ntypically the upper left-hand corner.\n\n104\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.791\nAnd if you've watched any of the previous\nthings in our library about HTML5 Canvass,\n\n105\n00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:19.373\na lot of times it's easy to reason\nabout if it's in the center.\n\n106\n00:05:19.373 --> 00:05:22.990\nHowever that's a lot to keep track\nup when your first getting started.\n\n107\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.142\nSo what I'm gonna do is even\nthough this is in the center,\n\n108\n00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:29.440\nI would probably keep this on\nthe upper left-hand corner.\n\n109\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.210\nAt least at start, and\nthen come back and add that later.\n\n110\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.590\nSo don't add things that you\nmay not need at the start.\n\n111\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.820\nI think it's called YAGNI,\nyou ain't gonna need it.\n\n112\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.520\nSo we need this position, and given this\nposition we can tell, okay, where is it?\n\n113\n00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.123\nNow likewise,\nthere's a few considerations.\n\n114\n00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:55.889\nMy ultimate goal is I want the paddle\nto be able to move up and down, right?\n\n115\n00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.127\nBut I don't want the paddle to\nbe able to go way over here or\n\n116\n00:05:59.127 --> 00:06:02.431\nI don't want the paddle to come\nall the way off the screen,\n\n117\n00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:05.770\nbecause then that becomes very confusing,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.890\nWe should have boundaries.\n\n119\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.600\nMoreover, if I'm talking about moving,\n\n120\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.350\nI need some kind of change in these\nin order to determine moving.\n\n121\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.450\nBut here's where it starts to\ndeviate from the ball a little bit.\n\n122\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.222\nI don't need a dx.\n\n123\n00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:27.960\nI don't need that because I'm not\nmoving the paddle forward or anything.\n\n124\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.554\nNow, I could change that\ndynamic of the game later and\n\n125\n00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:32.493\nit would be more like air hockey.\n\n126\n00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n127\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.289\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nCuz you can move up to the center line.\n\n128\n00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:35.860\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; However,\n\n129\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.413\nthat adds a lot more logic\nto be able to say, well,\n\n130\n00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:42.240\nthe left-hand paddle can only move\nto the center, and no further.\n\n131\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.870\nSo for now we just need up and\n\n132\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.590\ndown movement,\nwhich is going to be our dy, right?\n\n133\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.714\nSo I'm keeping these terms similar so\n\n134\n00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:53.360\nI don't have to add additional\nvocabulary in my discussions.\n\n135\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.160\nBut this would define our paddle.\n\n136\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.112\nAnd I think I'm gonna take\na similar approach to the ball and\n\n137\n00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:01.484\njust make a single paddle\nas an object literal.\n\n138\n00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:06.530\nAnd make sure that it works, everything's\ngood to go, before we get too crazy.\n\n139\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.620\nSo now that we have kind\nof that that plan laid out,\n\n140\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.560\nthat thought process, let's go ahead and\nmake our first paddle.\n\n141\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.353\nSo if we come into my screen here,\n\n142\n00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:20.470\njust a quick review of where we left off,\nwe have our ball in a separate file.\n\n143\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.501\nWe have our app.js, right?\n\n144\n00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:27.400\nAnd that actually just fills the screen.\n\n145\n00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.860\nIt checks some conditions.\n\n146\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.680\nNow, I may end up coming back and\nchanging.\n\n147\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.340\nThis is just for some testing purposes.\n\n148\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.458\nThis is always in flux.\n\n149\n00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:38.880\nAnd then ball.update, ball.render and\nI'm passing in the context.\n\n150\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.861\nIf we come over this is what we get.\n\n151\n00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right now is just.\n\n152\n00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:47.042\n[SOUND] It's resetting the game based on,\nand it does that by assigning\n\n153\n00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:51.529\nthe old attributes from the original\nposition back to the ball.\n\n154\n00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:52.667\nIt does some override.\n\n155\n00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.443\nSo I'm not creating new objects,\nI'm just resetting, so to speak.\n\n156\n00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:58.388\nSo that may be something\nthat we wanna consider.\n\n157\n00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:01.244\nBut do keep in mind, this is not in stone.\n\n158\n00:08:01.244 --> 00:08:03.322\nThis is kind of influx for now.\n\n159\n00:08:03.322 --> 00:08:07.503\nBecause our main goal is to build these\nsmall objects that we're gonna compose\n\n160\n00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:08.970\ninto our game eventually.\n\n161\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.125\nSo that's where the logic comes into play.\n\n162\n00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:14.230\nAnd in addition to that,\n\n163\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.230\nI'm gonna always kinda build in\nthis file and then abstract.\n\n164\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.840\nSo, or not necessarily abstract,\nbut kind of extract, abstract and\n\n165\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.295\nextract are different words.\n\n166\n00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:28.580\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's your vocabulary lesson for today.\n\n167\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:36.030\nBut let's see, let's create a paddle,\nand here's the end of the paddle, Right?\n\n168\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.170\nSo boom, there we go.\n\n169\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd then I'm just gonna say let paddle =,\nand it's a object literal.\n\n170\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.510\nNow we just talked about\nthat we need an exposition.\n\n171\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.280\nWell, let's start with\nthe left hand paddle.\n\n172\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.580\nWhere should it be placed\non the x coordinate?\n\n173\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.160\nWell, let's see here,\nI'm thinking it should be placed\n\n174\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.780\nprobably right at 0, right?\n\n175\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.530\nIt's right up against the edge,\nand then for the y,\n\n176\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.970\nlet's just move it down a little bit, 30.\n\n177\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:15.390\nAnd then dy, we're going to say,\n10, fairly fast moving paddle.\n\n178\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.520\nAnd then what else do we need\nto describe said paddle?\n\n179\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.370\nWell we said that we need a height.\n\n180\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.237\nAnd let's just go with a 100 pixels.\n\n181\n00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:26.795\nNow, this is assuming that\nthe scale is one to one,\n\n182\n00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:31.000\nso when l put a 100 in here l'm\ngonna get 100 pixels in height.\n\n183\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.766\nNow, this is about tweaking, so to speak.\n\n184\n00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:36.900\nSo we're not necessarily sold here.\n\n185\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.380\nAnd I'm thinking about 15.\n\n186\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.060\nI do not want something huge and\nbulky on the screen,\n\n187\n00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.600\nI want something fairly tiny,\nthat you can still see it.\n\n188\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.899\nAnd that's just something\nthat I've chosen.\n\n189\n00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.900\nIf you want giant paddles,\n\n190\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.985\nhave at it, that is-\n&gt;&gt; I gotta tell you in original pong it\n\n191\n00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:53.037\nwas pretty much a line.\n\n192\n00:09:53.037 --> 00:09:57.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was a very tiny line,\nand we will change some things, but\n\n193\n00:09:57.635 --> 00:10:01.140\nmaybe we'll keep in a throw back here and\nthere.\n\n194\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.942\nSo we'll keep these fairly small, but in\norder to help with later things, I'm think\n\n195\n00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:12.435\nhaving at least some width, some amount,\nis gonna make things a little easier.\n\n196\n00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:18.615\nAnd then we need an update, and\na render, which takes a context.\n\n197\n00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:23.416\nAnd again just to remind you,\nI'm using new objects literal notation for\n\n198\n00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:29.170\nthese methods, so I don't have to say\nfunction, or update colon function.\n\n199\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.970\nAnd define them as such.\n\n200\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.440\nSo let's see, is that all we need?\n\n201\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.340\nWe need a color.\n\n202\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.902\nNow, this is one of those early,\nabstractions.\n\n203\n00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:41.150\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Pumpkin.\n\n204\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.100\n&gt;&gt; Pumpkin.\n\n205\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.560\nThat one might work.\n\n206\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n207\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.720\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe.\n\n208\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.680\n&gt;&gt; I just threw it out there.\n\n209\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.230\n&gt;&gt; If it doesn't, then we'll blame Zack.\n\n210\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.003\nSo we have these kind of laid out.\n\n211\n00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:57.233\nSome of these are not necessary\nto abstract early on., but\n\n212\n00:10:57.233 --> 00:11:00.700\nI like these descriptions, like color.\n\n213\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.871\nI could just always just say it's black,\nright?\n\n214\n00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.917\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n215\n00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:05.237\n&gt;&gt; And that's it, but\n\n216\n00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:09.984\nif I store that internal state then\nI can at least have some flexibility.\n\n217\n00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:13.801\nI'm kinda violating\nthe The YAGNI principle,\n\n218\n00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.479\nyou ain't gonna need it in this.\n\n219\n00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:19.901\nHowever, sometimes rules\nare meant to bent,\n\n220\n00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:23.095\nat least till they's right in the middle.\n\n221\n00:11:23.095 --> 00:11:25.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily broken.\n\n222\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.750\nSo we have this laid out, and\nlet's see if we have any syntax here, so\n\n223\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.120\nif we come over here and\nwe refresh, It looks good.\n\n224\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.440\nNow that we have this paddle, right?\n\n225\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.330\nHow are we going to render that paddle?\n\n226\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.459\nWell, we're gonna use that\ncontext that's passed in,\n\n227\n00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:45.700\nand we're just going to\ncreate the rectangle.\n\n228\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:52.652\nSo, ctx.fillStyle = this.color And\n\n229\n00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:56.550\nthen ctx.fillRect.\n\n230\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.839\nAnd fillRect requires an x and a y, and\n\n231\n00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:08.614\na width and a height, And just like so.\n\n232\n00:12:08.614 --> 00:12:13.999\nSo there's our render function, and\nactually let's see if render works.\n\n233\n00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:17.610\nSo paddle.render.\n\n234\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.450\nSo this is inside of our main function,\nwhich is actually calling itself over and\n\n235\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.690\nover and over again and refresh,\nand there's our paddle.\n\n236\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.830\nRight over here on the left\nit's kind of hard to see.\n\n237\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.680\nMaybe we'll pull that out a little\nbit further from the edge.\n\n238\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.860\n&gt;&gt; But is it pumpkin?\n\n239\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.820\n&gt;&gt; It is not pumpkin.\n\n240\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.560\n&gt;&gt; I didn't think it was pumpkin.\n\n241\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.696\n&gt;&gt; Pumpkin is not going to work.\n\n242\n00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:41.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go with salmon.\n\n243\n00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:42.722\nWhich is kind of a, well,\nit's salmon colored.\n\n244\n00:12:42.722 --> 00:12:43.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n245\n00:12:43.537 --> 00:12:46.077\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nlet's make the height a little more.\n\n246\n00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:50.610\nMainly because I have a giant canvas,\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.060\nSo relatively speaking.\n\n248\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.568\nNow, this could be something that\nyou could adjust during difficulty\n\n249\n00:12:55.568 --> 00:12:56.467\nlevels, right?\n\n250\n00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:58.770\nYou could do,\nI'm not gonna do this upfront.\n\n251\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.150\nBut I always like to think, hey,\nis this something that I need to adjust,\n\n252\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.610\nor is it okay to be set?\n\n253\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.950\nHeight, well it's gonna become more\ndifficult if you have a giant space and\n\n254\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.950\nyour paddle gets tiny, tiny, tiny.\n\n255\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.042\nI don't know if you ever\nplayed what is it, stick ball?\n\n256\n00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:16.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n257\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, you don't have a bat,\nyou got a stick, and\n\n258\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.030\nyou were like, I can't hit it, I can't.\n\n259\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's because there's very small\n\n260\n00:13:24.948 --> 00:13:27.400\ncross sectional area in\norder to get that done.\n\n261\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n262\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.170\nthen let's see what it looks like,\nAnd that's probably more appropriate,\n\n263\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.890\nwe would probably mess\nwith that a little bit.\n\n264\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.340\nLet's pull this out to about 30 pixels\njust so it's a little easier to see.\n\n265\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.060\nThere we go, so we have our paddle.\n\n266\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.495\nExcept it doesn't actually do anything,\nand that's no good.\n\n267\n00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:54.110\nMainly because the update\nfunction is not being called.\n\n268\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.290\nAnd even if it was, it's not written.\n\n269\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.010\nIt doesn't change the attributes\nabout the paddle that's being used\n\n270\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.270\nto render the paddle out.\n\n271\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.980\nSo what do we want to do?\n\n272\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:12.539\nLet's just stay or the very simple\napproximation, this.y += this.dy.\n\n273\n00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:15.930\nNow, you're like, well you just\nrefreshed and it didn't do anything.\n\n274\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.046\nThat's because I forgot\nto call update on here.\n\n275\n00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:21.819\nSo, paddle.update, like so.\n\n276\n00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.600\nSo refresh and there it goes.\n\n277\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.687\nAnd then it goes all the way off screen,\nwhoops.\n\n278\n00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:30.362\nSo that is not good, right?\n\n279\n00:14:30.362 --> 00:14:35.707\nSo we could do things like\nwe do on the ball and\n\n280\n00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:40.050\nbounce, actually let's do that.\n\n281\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.777\nSo we should probably bounce y,\njust to keep similar things.\n\n282\n00:14:46.332 --> 00:14:49.588\nAnd what is this gonna do?\n\n283\n00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:54.705\nThis is gonna say dy = -1 times this.dy.\n\n284\n00:14:57.096 --> 00:15:03.100\nIn the end, in order to do that, I'm\ngonna have to check the paddle's radius.\n\n285\n00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.560\nOr excuse me, not the radius,\nthe paddle's position.\n\n286\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.050\nThe things get a little bit different,\nnow I copied and pasted there.\n\n287\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.350\nNot necessarily a big proponent of that.\n\n288\n00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.890\nBut this is as a reminder so\n\n289\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.660\nwe can reason about how this\nrelates to the ball, all right?\n\n290\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.916\nAnd see the differences.\n\n291\n00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:23.720\nSo paddle bounce or\nhow about paddle boundaries?\n\n292\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.910\nSo to speak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that makes sense.\n\n293\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.470\n&gt;&gt; So if I do that.\n\n294\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.277\nNow, that's Cmd D in Atom.\n\n295\n00:15:32.277 --> 00:15:37.440\nOr Ctrl D in Atom, if you're on\nthe Windows or Linux platforms.\n\n296\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.870\nI'm gonna say paddle.\n\n297\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.175\nIf the paddle y, that is not right,\n\n298\n00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:48.466\nis less than the paddle height,\nlet's think about this.\n\n299\n00:15:48.466 --> 00:15:53.397\nAnd then let's change this to height\nas well, just to keep consistency.\n\n300\n00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:58.215\nSo if the paddle y is less\nthan the paddle height.\n\n301\n00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:02.313\nActually, no, because it is in\nthe upper left hand corner, right?\n\n302\n00:16:02.313 --> 00:16:05.843\nSo if I was in the center we\ncan do things like that, but\n\n303\n00:16:05.843 --> 00:16:10.237\nreally we want to say, if it is less\nthan 0, an equal to in there and\n\n304\n00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:15.030\nkinda limit it a little more, and\nactually I think I'm going to do that.\n\n305\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:20.000\nAnd I want that to do as soon as\nit hits the 0, it will stop it.\n\n306\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.270\nIt won't let it kind of wiggle\nbeyond zero between those, so\n\n307\n00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.770\nwe'll get a little\nstronger detection there.\n\n308\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:31.340\nIf the paddle y is greater\nthan the canvas height\n\n309\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:37.030\nminus the paddle height,\nwell, what would that mean?\n\n310\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.270\nLet's actually hop back over\nto the sky cam just for\n\n311\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.860\na moment because I think it's\ngoing to be easier To see that, so\n\n312\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.030\nwhat I'm thinking is,\nlet's say the panel is 300, right?\n\n313\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:56.740\nSo let's say if it bounces against here\nand the position is right here, we're\n\n314\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.850\ntrying to limit this position because\nthat's where everything's referenced.\n\n315\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.940\nI should probably use a different\ncolor then I differ red on red.\n\n316\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.860\nSo there's the reference position.\n\n317\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.310\nIf this is height, then\n\n318\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:16.730\nthis would be canvas height\nminus height of the panel.\n\n319\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.090\nIf it is greater than that which\nmeans this would move down.\n\n320\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.730\nRight?\n\n321\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.180\nThen, yeah, I think that's\nactually a good limitation and\n\n322\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.240\nwe didn't even put an equal sign and\nsay nope, stop,\n\n323\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.610\nas soon as it hits there and\nnow we're all set.\n\n324\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.300\nNow that would be different if\nthe off set was here in the middle.\n\n325\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.760\nThen would only be half of the height So\nkeep that in mind, if you ever change\n\n326\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.950\nthe reference in this, somebody's boundary\nconditions are gonna have to change.\n\n327\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.820\nNow, ultimately,\nI think these boundary conditions,\n\n328\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.480\nwe're gonna see a pattern\nfall out of them that\n\n329\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.840\nallows us to be a little more dynamic,\nbut we're not worried about that upfront.\n\n330\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.720\nSo if we come back to my screen here,\nI think there should be get other than.\n\n331\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.410\nLet's have an equal to and\nto some extent the ball,\n\n332\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:11.390\nwe can probably add an equal to there as\nwell and get a little harder boundary.\n\n333\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.490\nBut, let's just keep it, right?\n\n334\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.320\nWhat's it gonna do?\n\n335\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.350\nIt's going to bounce a y\nwhich is switch directions,\n\n336\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.000\nif it comes in contact with\neither edge in the y direction.\n\n337\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.660\nSo if we refresh, boom, boom, boom.\n\n338\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.660\n&gt;&gt; It's magical.\n\n339\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.680\n&gt;&gt; It is magical.\n\n340\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.120\nAnd now this paddle has all\nof the attributes, the color,\n\n341\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.570\neverything that we need in addition\nto it's rendering update does work,\n\n342\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.910\nthis is a single paddle object\n\n343\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.800\nI'm not sure if that's what we need,\nright?\n\n344\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.800\nSo, well how would this best be played?\n\n345\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.700\nWell if I extract this, better yet,\nI have a question for you Zach.\n\n346\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.670\nGot a question for you.\n\n347\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.250\n&gt;&gt; And I have an answer and a question.\n\n348\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.780\n&gt;&gt; How many\n&gt;&gt; How many paddles do you think you need\n\n349\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.910\nin order to play table ping pong?\n\n350\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Well there should be at least two,\nor four if you had a partner.\n\n351\n00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Four if you have a partner,\ntwo at minimum.\n\n352\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.140\nAs a stance we've built one, right.\n\n353\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.500\nAnd that's the only one we could ever had.\n\n354\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, and is this paddle for\nthe player, for the human player or\n\n355\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.320\nis this paddle for the computer.\n\n356\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.270\n&gt;&gt; So I think here we've almost gotten\nlike a very simple computer player.\n\n357\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.260\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; That's what I think.\n\n358\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.610\n&gt;&gt; By proxy.\n\n359\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:40.240\nSo this update and this now that logic is\ninside of the actual game loop, right?\n\n360\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.050\nIt's not to the paddle.\n\n361\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.050\nI think what would be best is\nif we like pull this out And\n\n362\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.540\nthen make it to where we can\nmake multiple paddles, right?\n\n363\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.700\nWhat if we want two players?\n\n364\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.620\nWhat if we want four players?\n\n365\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.710\nNow, some of the logic would have\nto be back embedded into the game,\n\n366\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.200\nbut right now,\nwe only have the ability to have one.\n\n367\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.460\nNow, we could find a way around that, but\n\n368\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.220\nmight be better if we pull\nthis out into a function.\n\n369\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.500\nEither constructor function or a function\nthat returns objects like a factory\n\n370\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.010\nfunction, that allows us\nto do some tweaking right?\n\n371\n00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.460\nBecause as you see this\npaddle's always on the left.\n\n372\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n373\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.930\n&gt;&gt; There's no way to move\nthe paddle to the right.\n\n374\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.050\nWell how does the other paddle, if you're\nboth on the same side how do you play.\n\n375\n00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.268\nI guess you get up against a wall or\nsomething and\n\n376\n00:20:25.268 --> 00:20:26.551\njust [SOUND] Not as much fun.\n\n377\n00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not as much fun.\n\n378\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.420\nSo let's kind of pull this\nout into a separate file,\n\n379\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:37.220\ndo a little bit of the old switcheroo\nto get this a little more general.\n\n380\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.680\nBut I think, I agree with you,\nthis is more of a computer pathway,\n\n381\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.790\nvery simple strategy.\n\n382\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.050\nSo to speak.\n\n383\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.380\nSo we're gonna extract it out.\n\n384\n00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.550\n&gt;&gt; Or we gotta extract it out.\n\n385\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:51.060\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna extract it, and then\nwe're going to apply a little bit of an,\n\n386\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.020\nI'm hesitant to say extraction.\n\n387\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.436\nWe're gonna build a factory [CROSSTALK]\nthat returns paddle objects, right?\n\n388\n00:20:58.436 --> 00:21:00.980\nSo let's do exactly that.\n\n389\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.430\nIf we come over here into\nmy JavaScript folder And\n\n390\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.710\ninclude a new file, what is that file?\n\n391\n00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.770\nLet's go paddle that JS, that make sense\nto me, and then inside of the app,\n\n392\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:19.630\nzoom out, l am actually usually, l am\nusually to make sure don't break anything,\n\n393\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.000\npull this out, put it in paddle\nwhich is now like a global,\n\n394\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.710\nlike panel as a global variable, And\n\n395\n00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.040\neverything should still work as\nlong as I put it on the actual\n\n396\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.900\npage before app.js, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.525\nSo, script, and here we go.\n\n398\n00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:49.490\njs/paddle.js Let's go and check it out.\n\n399\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.490\nLet see if it works.\n\n400\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.930\nAnd it still works.\n\n401\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.970\nWhich is good.\n\n402\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.590\nSo, we've extracted it.\n\n403\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.230\nYey.\n\n404\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.710\nNow, let's make it where we\ncan have more than one paddle\n\n405\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.720\nbecause I think the construction\nof the paddle should actually be\n\n406\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.200\nin the game not in the paddle like\nthe paddle is not gonna construct itself.\n\n407\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.590\nThe game should construct the paddle.\n\n408\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.830\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n409\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.760\nAs you can see like the ball, right?\n\n410\n00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.600\nNow, the ball,\nwe didn't do this with the ball,\n\n411\n00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.525\nbecause we needed one ball but\nwe could and we still might need to.\n\n412\n00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:27.510\nAgain, and of being creative,\nwhat if we wanna play pong with two balls?\n\n413\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.050\nRight, you got them just going all\nover the place, and you gotta,\n\n414\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.080\nyeah I've seen real people play ping\npong like that, and it's crazy.\n\n415\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.410\nIt blows my mind.\n\n416\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:43.333\nSo now that we have the paddle working,\nthis is actually gonna be fairly easy,\n\n417\n00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:49.467\nbecause what we're gonna\ndo is say const And\n\n418\n00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:54.749\nI'm gonna make it upper case, and\nthat's just a semantic, it's kind of like\n\n419\n00:22:54.749 --> 00:23:00.560\na constructor or I have seen people, like\ncreate paddle, and then what am I doing?\n\n420\n00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.400\nI'm creating a paddle,\nwhich is a specific type of object.\n\n421\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.080\nAnd I'm just gonna run\nthis an error function.\n\n422\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.280\nAnd I'm wrapping this on parenthesis, that\nway it's returning an object instead of\n\n423\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.590\nactually evaluating as a function body,\nokay.\n\n424\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.515\nSo, now that we have this, well,\neverything is going to break.\n\n425\n00:23:24.515 --> 00:23:29.948\nAnd its [LAUGH].\n\n426\n00:23:29.948 --> 00:23:33.920\nBut we have a small little\nchange that we can make here.\n\n427\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.540\nLet paddle equal paddle Like so.\n\n428\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.660\nAlright so this is a paddle.\n\n429\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.890\nRefresh and there we go.\n\n430\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.030\nWe are back to it and\nto some extent it's a computer player.\n\n431\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.820\nIt is not actually doing anything,\nit's just resetting a bunch of times.\n\n432\n00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.026\nIt is actually resetting the ball, right?\n\n433\n00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:54.688\nSo we would have to tweak that.\n\n434\n00:23:54.688 --> 00:23:58.264\nBut I might save that for\na little bit later.\n\n435\n00:23:58.264 --> 00:24:00.748\nAs it stands, we have this paddle.\n\n436\n00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:02.419\nThere's no way to reset the paddle.\n\n437\n00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:04.710\nThe paddle is completely automated.\n\n438\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.780\nHow is the paddle automated?\n\n439\n00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.500\nIt's through this set of if\nconditionals and the ability to bounce.\n\n440\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:15.410\nSo, we might have gotten a little\ntoo specific for this paddle.\n\n441\n00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.010\nI don't think in general,\nall paddles should do that.\n\n442\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n443\n00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.180\nBut we're gonna leave it there.\n\n444\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.430\nWe're can always come and take it out,\n\n445\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.900\nand restructure things, and\nthat's kind of how this flows.\n\n446\n00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.660\nSo I wanna be very explicit about that.\n\n447\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.674\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, what are some of the things\nthat we need to add to the paddle?\n\n448\n00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, so for a human player, I think\nwe should have the ability to actually\n\n449\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.062\ncontrol it,\ninstead of just moving it around.\n\n450\n00:24:36.062 --> 00:24:39.061\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; For a computer one, I'm thinking,\n\n451\n00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:43.434\nwe might make a few computer ones that\nhave a little bit different strategies, so\n\n452\n00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:44.480\nto speak, right?\n\n453\n00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.505\nIt would be kind of interesting.\n\n454\n00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:51.383\nWhat if one kinda grew and shrank, and\nthings like that and actually got fairly,\n\n455\n00:24:51.383 --> 00:24:53.186\njust to be a little creative.\n\n456\n00:24:53.186 --> 00:24:57.524\nI'm probably not gonna do crazy\nstrategies like ball detection,\n\n457\n00:24:57.524 --> 00:24:59.615\nyou never know, I might.\n\n458\n00:24:59.615 --> 00:25:01.935\nBut those are some things\nthat we need to add, and\n\n459\n00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:06.815\nto some extent I think the paddle that we\nbuilt right now will probably be removed,\n\n460\n00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:08.790\nlike some of the functionality\nwill be removed.\n\n461\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.090\nAnd we will use it more or\nless as a prototype or a mix-in, so\n\n462\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.310\nto speak, to construct the other paddles,\nlike the human paddle.\n\n463\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.810\nWhat does it do?\n\n464\n00:25:16.895 --> 00:25:19.790\nWell it needs to be mostly the paddle.\n\n465\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.850\nHowever, maybe its update function\nneeds to be a little bit different.\n\n466\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.060\nBut now that we have this,\n\n467\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.560\nwe have kind of this structure that\nwe can use to keep going on, so.\n\n468\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n469\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.481\n&gt;&gt; I think all, I think we're at a good\nstopping point but we definitely need to\n\n470\n00:25:36.481 --> 00:25:41.211\ncome and do that human paddle as well as\ncomputer paddle, and those are coming up.\n\n471\n00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Creating the paddle.\n\n472\n00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.210\nI enjoyed this, I don't know about you,\nbut I'm enjoying this whole thing.\n\n473\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.570\nAll right Justin, do you have any\nlast words before we move on?\n\n474\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know, It's kinda hard\nto see how this is gonna come together.\n\n475\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.260\nBut trust me, we're trying to build this\nas I would think about it, to be very\n\n476\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.380\nexplicit about the thought process,\ncuz sometimes that's the biggest issue.\n\n477\n00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.630\nHow do I get started?\n\n478\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.820\nHow do I do the next step?\n\n479\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.433\nAnd you'll notice in taking small little\nchunks, how do I build this part,\n\n480\n00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:09.471\nhow do I build this part,\nhow do I build this part?\n\n481\n00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:12.767\nAnd then once you have\nall these small parts,\n\n482\n00:26:12.767 --> 00:26:16.185\nyou're like well look at that,\nI have a game.\n\n483\n00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:18.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then last final push\n\n484\n00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.868\nis what makes it difficult, right?\n\n485\n00:26:20.868 --> 00:26:27.520\nIf you can remove all the hurdles by just\ngoing one step at a time, we're all good.\n\n486\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.600\nSo definitely stay tuned as we continue\nprogressing through building our\n\n487\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.820\nhomage to Pong.\n\n488\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.130\n&gt;&gt; So join us as we continue to\nbuild our homage to Pong and\n\n489\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.750\nhave a great time learning HTML5\ncanvas projects, watch every episode.\n\n490\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.050\nAnd go to our course library,\n\n491\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.190\nthere's hundreds of videos there all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n492\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.590\nGreat job Justin.\n\n493\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.350\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevProTV.\n\n494\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.960\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n495\n00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.580\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n496\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.367\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n497\n00:26:52.367 --> 00:26:54.783\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again very soon.\n\n498\n00:26:54.783 --> 00:26:59.869\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.610\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.440\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with HTML5 canvas projects.\n\n5\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.090\nWe're gonna be creating the human\npaddle now in our homage to Pong.\n\n6\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.270\nJustin Dennison,\n\n7\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.318\nplease show us how to do this thing\n&gt;&gt; I do wanna clarify that we're not going\n\n8\n00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:32.622\nto make a paddle that is\nhuman shaped [CROSSTALK].\n\n9\n00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:37.647\nMake the human player paddle\nthat's controllable by the paddle.\n\n10\n00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:40.824\nBut yeah, that,\nlong titles are hard, right.\n\n11\n00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So how are you doing today, Zack?\n\n12\n00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and I'm very excited.\n\n13\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.490\nThis has been a wonderful show and\nI wanna see more.\n\n14\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, let's kind of describe\nwhere we left off and what we need to do.\n\n15\n00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.237\nI know there is a bunch we need to do but\nin the immediate term, right now.\n\n16\n00:00:56.237 --> 00:01:00.080\nAnd as we described in a previous episode.\n\n17\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.370\nWe essentially made a paddle\nthose computer control and\n\n18\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.290\njust kinda bounces around.\n\n19\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440\nIt may win sometimes, it may not.\n\n20\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.070\nIf it was really fast then\nit'd be really hard to beat.\n\n21\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.770\nBut that's not what we want.\n\n22\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.940\nThis is a game that kinda plays itself.\n\n23\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.170\nUltimately, it doesn't\nplay anything right now.\n\n24\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.090\nBut there's no way for\na human to control it.\n\n25\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.215\n&gt;&gt; And so we have to clone the paddle\nto make the human player paddle.\n\n26\n00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.610\nAnd how are we gonna manage the movements,\nhow are we gonna do that?\n\n27\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.790\n&gt;&gt; And so those are separate,\nlet's think about this.\n\n28\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.029\nIf we have a general paddle, has all\nthe attributes and kind of that thing.\n\n29\n00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:41.170\nIf we can clone that and then change\nmaybe the update function, right?\n\n30\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.010\nCuz that's actually what's\ncausing the movement.\n\n31\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.050\nThen we can use is DOM events,\nlike keyboard controls or\n\n32\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.450\nmouse controls to control the actual\npaddle using the update function.\n\n33\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.140\nEverything else could be exactly the same.\n\n34\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.900\nAnd by using this kind of composition\nof objects or mutation of objects.\n\n35\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.023\nI guess, ultimately,\n\n36\n00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:05.401\nit's polymorphic in a sense because\na human player paddle is a paddle.\n\n37\n00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.730\nBut we've changed some attribute about it,\noverwritten it.\n\n38\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.690\nAnd we're going to do exactly that.\n\n39\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.840\nSo this may actually be kinda short.\n\n40\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.910\nBut there is some wiring up\nthat we have to do inside of\n\n41\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.460\nthe game in order to make this work.\n\n42\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.290\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome into the screen here.\n\n43\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.930\nAnd look this is where left,\nooh, that's nice.\n\n44\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.562\nNow, if you're just joining\nus you're like, what is this?\n\n45\n00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:29.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; What's going on over here?\n\n46\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.970\nWell, the ball, there's not,\nnothing's getting played yet, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.770\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n48\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.670\n&gt;&gt; Basic elements were created.\n\n49\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're building this basic\nelements in order to build a full game.\n\n50\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.153\nAs it stands though the ball\njust goes off screen and\n\n51\n00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:47.228\nresets to its original position.\n\n52\n00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.237\nSo no worries, we'll get to that.\n\n53\n00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:51.432\nSo we have our paddle here and\n\n54\n00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:56.740\nthat paddle is being created from\nthis paddle function, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.807\nSo I'm creating this paddle object,\nthat is, salmon and\n\n56\n00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:03.135\nhas this update and this bounce.\n\n57\n00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:05.837\nAnd as I said in the previous episode,\n\n58\n00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:10.910\nit may not be that the bouncing is\nnecessary for the base paddle object.\n\n59\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.668\n&gt;&gt; Right, do all paddles need to bounce?\n\n60\n00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:16.929\nMaybe not, right?\n\n61\n00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.970\nMaybe some paddles need to be,\nhave limits or things of that nature.\n\n62\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.640\nDo all paddles need to update?\n\n63\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.040\nWell, in order for them to move, yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.590\nDo all panels need to render?\n\n65\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.320\nYeah, all the panels are gonna\nlook exactly the same.\n\n66\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.530\nBased on the attributes that are set.\n\n67\n00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.580\nAnd do all paddles in x ally\ndy with a height and a color?\n\n68\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.280\nSure, let's agree on that.\n\n69\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.160\nBut for now we're not gonna touch this.\n\n70\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.900\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nuse this and kind of change it.\n\n71\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.190\nAnd just let what happens happens.\n\n72\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.390\nAnd then try to observe patterns before\nwe can do some rearranging later.\n\n73\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.520\nSo in order to make the human\nplayer paddle, well,\n\n74\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.270\nI'm gonna do that inside of App.JS.\n\n75\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.470\nJust as we always do and\nthen extract that out.\n\n76\n00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.930\nCuz I think it's a little easier for\nme, well, to show you.\n\n77\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.490\nBut also it's a little easier for\nme to reason about.\n\n78\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.918\nSo let's do this.\n\n79\n00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:18.310\nHuman Player, Paddle, and then,\nthat looks kind of weird.\n\n80\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.310\nAnd here we go,\nthis the End of the Human Player.\n\n81\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.600\nSo I'm thinking the HumanPlayer,\nWhat is that gonna do?\n\n82\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.760\nThat is going to be,\nwhat does it need to take?\n\n83\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.430\nI don't think it needs to take any,\n\n84\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.900\nit doesn't need to take any\narguments as it stands.\n\n85\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.835\nWell, and mainly because the paddle\ndoesn't need to take any arguments as it\n\n86\n00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:50.380\nstands, we always have these default.\n\n87\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.210\nNow, ultimately,\n\n88\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.320\nI think we're gonna have to change that\nbecause this is not quite what we need.\n\n89\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.240\nBut for now,\nlet's just get the movements for\n\n90\n00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.410\nthe left-hand screen where the human\nplayer would actually be controlling.\n\n91\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.710\nSo it's not gonna take anything.\n\n92\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.462\nWhat I think I wanna do is object.assign,\nright?\n\n93\n00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:21.106\nSo return a new object, and\nthen I'm gonna say paddle, And\n\n94\n00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:25.290\nas it stands what this will give me,\nand I will just show you.\n\n95\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:33.690\nSo this is our testHumanPaddle\nequals HumanPaddle or HumanPlayer.\n\n96\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.600\nI guess I should keep these named\nappropriately, HumanPlayerPaddle.\n\n97\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.100\nLet's do that.\n\n98\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.471\nAnd if I come back over and I refresh,\nif I type, Human or testHuman.\n\n99\n00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.780\nIs that how I spelled it?\n\n100\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.340\nYeah, testHumanPaddle.\n\n101\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.150\nMaybe I didn't refresh.\n\n102\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.450\ntestHumanPaddle.\n\n103\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.240\nHuman playing a paddle?\n\n104\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.760\nYep, so here we go.\n\n105\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.290\nWhat I get is whatever the paddle returns\n\n106\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.620\nbecause I'm not assigning any\nnew updates or attributes.\n\n107\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.220\nAnd just to show you, my render\nfunction is pretty much the same.\n\n108\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.780\nAnd if I go here,\nit shows me what's calling what.\n\n109\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.092\nAnd how can I?\n\n110\n00:06:22.092 --> 00:06:25.718\nUsually, it will show me.\n\n111\n00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.920\nI would have to print that out.\n\n112\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.916\nAnd then the update takes no arguments.\n\n113\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.410\nAnd it has our scope.\n\n114\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.440\nSo this is exactly the same as just\nthe regular paddle object, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.680\nWell, that's a good start because\nI think all paddles should be\n\n116\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.110\ncomposed of that paddle object.\n\n117\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.330\nThere are a few things that\nI wanna change though.\n\n118\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.490\nI think probably the most\nimmediate change is we're\n\n119\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.430\ngonna pass in an object that\nhas a new update function.\n\n120\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.620\nAnd what this will do is override\nthe update function that is\n\n121\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.005\nalready part of this object here.\n\n122\n00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:09.670\nWhen I come over here and I look,\nnotice this update takes 0 arguments.\n\n123\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.470\nAnd it's just the regular update function.\n\n124\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.580\nIt would still work.\n\n125\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.138\nAnd just to show you it's exactly\nthe same, I've shown you the code here.\n\n126\n00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:21.560\nIf I change this to a human player paddle,\n\n127\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.750\nthis should still work if\nI have the syntax correct.\n\n128\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.550\nAnd I refresh and\nwhy is it not working now?\n\n129\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.920\nAnd that's because I have\nthis update function.\n\n130\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.790\nLet's just remove that and\nwe're back to where we were.\n\n131\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.490\nSo notice by just having that update that\ndoes nothing, it changes the behavior.\n\n132\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.038\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n133\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:44.680\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna change this behavior because\nthe update is now gonna be controlled by\n\n134\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.968\na person, by a player.\n\n135\n00:07:45.968 --> 00:07:50.488\nWell, if I do that then now I\nget to decide a little more\n\n136\n00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:53.011\nspecific about this update.\n\n137\n00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:56.914\nNow, I would like for the update not\nto take arguments, to be consistent.\n\n138\n00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.571\nHowever, I know.\n\n139\n00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:03.954\nThat it's probably likely that I'm gonna\nhave to use dom events that are going to\n\n140\n00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:05.448\ngive me some information.\n\n141\n00:08:05.448 --> 00:08:08.270\nAnd I'm gonna have to\npass in that information.\n\n142\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:14.150\nSo I'm just gonna pass in an e so we can\nsee those, and what do we want to do?\n\n143\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.860\nWell I want an up and\na down button to be the two controls.\n\n144\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.450\nI could use ws or any other combination\nbut I just want the up and down arrows.\n\n145\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.625\nSo for now, I'm just gonna\nleave this HumanPlayerPaddle.\n\n146\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.551\nAnd I'm gonna put this\nback to a regular Paddle.\n\n147\n00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:36.603\nThis HumanPlayerPaddle here,\n\n148\n00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:42.380\nI'm gonna leave that as just\nconsole.log(e) all right?\n\n149\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.330\nTo some extent we are done\nwith the human paddle.\n\n150\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n151\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's because we're building\nup from this more primitive object.\n\n152\n00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:57.490\nAnd to some extent we're just overriding\nthe parts that we don't need right?\n\n153\n00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.520\nIt's kind of like you got your ping\npong paddle in real life customized.\n\n154\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.670\nSo we get all of this but\nthen we're changing this portion.\n\n155\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.370\nAnd you can see by that logic\nit's probably best if we don't\n\n156\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.880\nhave the bounceY.\n\n157\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.210\nBut we'll deal with that later,\nwe'll come back and refactor that.\n\n158\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:22.200\nSo now we have this but the paddle is\nnot going to be aware of dom objects.\n\n159\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.240\nIf you look in our course library,\nI have something that\n\n160\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.560\nexplains responding to events with\nthe canvas object, the canvas element.\n\n161\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.308\nIf I want keyboard events, it's probably\nbest to add those to the window.\n\n162\n00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:39.498\nI could've added it in the canvas in\nthis case because the canvas more or\n\n163\n00:09:39.498 --> 00:09:41.530\nless fills the window so\nwhen you focus to do.\n\n164\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.210\nBut I'm still gonna add it to\nthe window just to make sure.\n\n165\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:53.530\nSo our HumanPlayerPaddle is done, so\nI'm just gonna rename this player as such.\n\n166\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.370\nAnd so if I come here, I can say player.\n\n167\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:03.433\nAnd if I say player.update, and\nI pass in an object of key code,\n\n168\n00:10:06.863 --> 00:10:09.558\nLike so, then what does it print out?\n\n169\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:13.892\nIt actually prints out key code, so\nthat e is going to be an event object.\n\n170\n00:10:13.892 --> 00:10:17.930\nAnd now I can wire this up\nto be handled by the window.\n\n171\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.220\nWindows gonna say okay,\n\n172\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.880\nevery time a key up event happens I'm\ngonna run this player object's function.\n\n173\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.098\nSo how do we do that now?\n\n174\n00:10:27.098 --> 00:10:31.684\nLet's say window.addEventListener, for\n\n175\n00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:35.428\nsome reason I forgot all about that.\n\n176\n00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:39.586\nAnd maybe keypress or keydown,\n\n177\n00:10:39.586 --> 00:10:43.620\nlets get start with keypress.\n\n178\n00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.380\nAnd we're gonna say player.update, and\n\n179\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.660\nnotice I'm not calling\nthe function with parenthesis.\n\n180\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.360\nWhat I'm wiring this up to is\nevery time there's key press,\n\n181\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.890\nI'm gonna run this function and\npass in the event right here.\n\n182\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.650\nAnd we're gonna get some weirdness,\nI am not gonna lie to you.\n\n183\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.688\nWe're gonna get some weirdness but\nthat's okay.\n\n184\n00:11:08.688 --> 00:11:14.780\nAll right, so if I refresh and now I hit\nup, not over there but over here focused.\n\n185\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.800\nNot quite there actually keydown, sorry.\n\n186\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.360\nThose key events are always kind of crazy,\nthere we go.\n\n187\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.320\nSo now every time I press a key, one that\nactually goes down on actually clicking\n\n188\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.387\nat the end, I get this keyboard event.\n\n189\n00:11:34.387 --> 00:11:39.810\nNow on the keyboard event I get key codes,\nkey codes and numbers.\n\n190\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.750\nI also get a key called ArrowUp.\n\n191\n00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.290\nNow I like using key codes\nbecause it allows me to not\n\n192\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.310\nnecessarily be tied to that particular\nkey and you'll see what I mean.\n\n193\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.270\nSo I'm gonna use key codes and\nthen build kind of this enum structure\n\n194\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.740\nusing an object that sets up constants for\nme okay?\n\n195\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.178\nSo now that we have key up and\n\n196\n00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:07.269\nkey down actually being passed in okay,\nlet's do this.\n\n197\n00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:14.576\nLet's build this window enum object for\nour keys, this is a constant.\n\n198\n00:12:18.787 --> 00:12:24.232\nKeys equals an object UP DOWN,\nso what is UP?\n\n199\n00:12:24.232 --> 00:12:28.341\nWell if I go and refresh and\nI hit up over here.\n\n200\n00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:33.740\nUp is the key code of 38,\nnotice ArrowUp is 38.\n\n201\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.540\nSo there's 38 and\nI know from previous experience\n\n202\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.500\nDOWN is 40.\n\n203\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.980\nOkay so these are mappings for\nyour respective keyboard.\n\n204\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.110\nSo now that I have these keys this update\nfunction which is the only thing we\n\n205\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:56.480\nchanged from the other paddle,\nis going to give us a key code.\n\n206\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.006\nLet's pull that off, keyCode and\n\n207\n00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:04.154\nthat is from the event object and\n\n208\n00:13:04.154 --> 00:13:09.060\nI think it's probably\neasier just to do a switch.\n\n209\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.223\nA switch statement cuz we may\nhave a bunch of keys, right?\n\n210\n00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:15.340\nAnd maybe we wanna come back and\nbuild air hockey.\n\n211\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.350\nThis is gonna be a little more versatile.\n\n212\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.550\nNow I'm not planning on that, so\nI'm not planning for additional features.\n\n213\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.777\nBut I like the switch statement when I\nhave the possibility of a lot of things,\n\n214\n00:13:26.777 --> 00:13:28.804\neven if I'm just gonna use a couple.\n\n215\n00:13:28.804 --> 00:13:33.169\nAnd now remember, this is numbers and\nstrings for switch.\n\n216\n00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:39.079\nSo there's our not e, but keyCode, And\n\n217\n00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:42.020\nwe need a case, and what case do we need?\n\n218\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.529\nWell you need it for KEYS.DOWN.\n\n219\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:52.809\nAnd let's break, need a case for KEYS.UP.\n\n220\n00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:57.439\nWe need a break and you should\nprobably always have a default case.\n\n221\n00:13:57.439 --> 00:14:02.882\nBut in this particular default case\nI'm just going to break immediately.\n\n222\n00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:06.498\nI don't need to do anything because\nI only want it to respond to\n\n223\n00:14:06.498 --> 00:14:08.318\nthe keys that I'm mapping to.\n\n224\n00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:13.872\nOkay this defines the behavior for\nthe update function, so just to show you,\n\n225\n00:14:16.087 --> 00:14:21.217\nArrow down, and here arrow up, excel and\n\n226\n00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:28.490\nI should probably stay\nconsistent with my semi colons.\n\n227\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.840\nSo if I come back, and I come over\nhere arrow up, arrow down, arrow up,\n\n228\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.130\narrow down and there we go just like that.\n\n229\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.520\nSo now the window event is\npiping in the objects and\n\n230\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.920\nwe have the ability to control,\nbut doesn't actually do anything.\n\n231\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.300\nRemember I did say we're gonna\nexperience some weirdness.\n\n232\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.220\nWhen you attach an event listener right?\n\n233\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.258\nAnd how, if I wanna key up or\n\n234\n00:14:57.258 --> 00:15:03.755\nkey down I would say this.y += this.dy,\n\n235\n00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:08.334\nthis.y -= this.dy right?\n\n236\n00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:11.815\nWhatever dy is, whatever the change is.\n\n237\n00:15:11.815 --> 00:15:13.386\nThat's how much we're gonna be applying so\n\n238\n00:15:13.386 --> 00:15:15.557\nit's no longer every time it's\nanimated bouncing around.\n\n239\n00:15:15.557 --> 00:15:19.605\nIt's only when I'm touching the key, okay?\n\n240\n00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:23.553\nSo that should move us up and\ndown if we refresh,\n\n241\n00:15:23.553 --> 00:15:28.811\nwell we actually have to change\nthis now from paddle to player.\n\n242\n00:15:28.811 --> 00:15:31.339\nSo just to test that I'm\ngoing to copy paste,\n\n243\n00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:36.004\nand we'll eventually change this around\nto be a little more consistent in naming.\n\n244\n00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:41.850\nBut refresh, cannot destruct your\nproperty key code of undefined or null.\n\n245\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.200\nWhere is that coming from,\nwell let's go look.\n\n246\n00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.513\nSo there's our key code.\n\n247\n00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:53.965\nI could have swore that worked.\n\n248\n00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:58.763\nWell originally we changed this to\nHumanPlayerPaddle And paddle is that, but\n\n249\n00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:01.608\nthe update function is\nexpecting arguments.\n\n250\n00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:05.131\nAnd this is where it's get a little tricky\nwhenever you change the argument types or\n\n251\n00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.210\nthe function definition,\nmethod definition.\n\n252\n00:16:09.842 --> 00:16:12.243\nWe just probably need to comment that out,\n\n253\n00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:15.850\ncuz no longer does the paddle need\nto move up and down every time.\n\n254\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.820\nIt only needs to update\nwhen there is a key event.\n\n255\n00:16:21.338 --> 00:16:27.221\nAnd here, now, You can see that nothing's,\n\n256\n00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:31.270\nI'm actually hitting key down and\nkey up, nothing's happening.\n\n257\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.170\nNow the reason you see that little bit\nof movement is because I'm scrolling\n\n258\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.730\nin the actual window.\n\n259\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.750\nThis isn't moving, why?\n\n260\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:47.640\nWell, I always warn you about,\nThe this content, the this keyword.\n\n261\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.520\nBecause it can change context, and\nlet's clear that out, if possible.\n\n262\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.660\n&gt;&gt; The word this?\n\n263\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.270\nThe word this means something special\ndepending on where the function is called.\n\n264\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.600\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n265\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.631\n&gt;&gt; So if I hit up and down,\nnotice it's the window object.\n\n266\n00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:05.840\nAnd that's because that's the event\nhandler, it's an event on the window.\n\n267\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.580\nSo it's not actually modifying this\npaddle, it's modifying this window.\n\n268\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.100\nAnd that's not the behavior that we want.\n\n269\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:21.189\nWhat we want instead is something like,\nI use arrow functions to get around this.\n\n270\n00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.458\nTo get around the weirdness with this.\n\n271\n00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you were talking about\nweirdness, I couldn't help but\n\n272\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.980\nthinking maybe a clown delivering\na sea bath while I'm sleeping.\n\n273\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.790\nNow that would be weird.\n\n274\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be weird.\n\n275\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.977\nAnd also, if that ever happens, don't\ntell me about it cuz it's frightening.\n\n276\n00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:39.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n277\n00:17:39.749 --> 00:17:43.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But what I do is I use fat\narrow functions to now bind this.\n\n278\n00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:48.859\nThe fat arrow function has the this\ncontext bound to the window object.\n\n279\n00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:49.649\n&gt;&gt; The fat arrow function, got it.\n\n280\n00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:51.398\n&gt;&gt; It uses lexical scoping.\n\n281\n00:17:51.398 --> 00:17:54.960\nBut then player.update,\nI'm passing in the event object, but\n\n282\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.990\nthen update is still gonna modify player.\n\n283\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.500\nAnd just to show you,\nremember the original way when we\n\n284\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.810\nkinda bound it up is it\nwas on the window object.\n\n285\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:10.888\nBut if I refresh and I come over here,\nand now it is actually, aha, there we go.\n\n286\n00:18:10.888 --> 00:18:17.920\nIt is the object that we expect, okay?\n\n287\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.441\nSo notice we have this individual\npaddle being printed out.\n\n288\n00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.790\nAnd just to show you, there it is.\n\n289\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.478\nBut there is one further issue.\n\n290\n00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:34.080\nthis.y and this.dy, it's changing, right?\n\n291\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.130\nWe think it's changing, but\nis it actually modifying anything?\n\n292\n00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.180\nSo I'm just gonna put\na console.log here and\n\n293\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.320\nsay down,\njust to make sure that's running.\n\n294\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:53.761\nBecause it doesn't look like anything's\nmoving about on the screen, so.\n\n295\n00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:57.020\nAnd it is, but this isn't moving.\n\n296\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.540\nWhy is that?\n\n297\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.240\nWell if we come down here,\npaddle.render(ctx), paddle.update().\n\n298\n00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.900\nAnd here's our paddle, makes sense.\n\n299\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.790\nWe're updating the player, and\nthat's because the paddle on the screen.\n\n300\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.579\nSo I say we fix this real quick.\n\n301\n00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:17.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of just having a general\n\n302\n00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:21.040\npaddle, I think this should be the player,\nokay?\n\n303\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.810\nSo let's change this to a let because we\nmay need to dereference and re-reference.\n\n304\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.900\nAnd then change this to player.\n\n305\n00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.780\nEverywhere you see paddle,\nI'm just gonna say player,\n\n306\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.480\nand that's because the player is a paddle.\n\n307\n00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.870\nAnd now, now we should get some movement.\n\n308\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.440\nAnd notice I'm moving up,\nand I'm moving down.\n\n309\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.050\nAnd it seems kinda slow.\n\n310\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.760\nReal slow, as a matter of fact.\n\n311\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.750\nWhy is it so slow?\n\n312\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.899\nIf we come back to paddle, our dy is 10.\n\n313\n00:19:54.899 --> 00:19:57.449\nWell that's all right if it's\ngetting called 60 times a second.\n\n314\n00:19:57.449 --> 00:20:04.418\nBut it's not the best if we having\nto hold up and down, right?\n\n315\n00:20:04.418 --> 00:20:09.880\nSo plus, that's kind of slow.\n\n316\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.701\nNow it does stop fairly quickly, so\n\n317\n00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:14.322\nwhat I do is I gotta update\nthe attributes, right?\n\n318\n00:20:14.322 --> 00:20:18.311\nIf I need a different default attribute\nfor a player that I know makes sense,\n\n319\n00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:19.760\nI'll just change that.\n\n320\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:27.300\nAnd let's change that to 30, and\nif I refresh, That's a little bit better.\n\n321\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.210\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n322\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm seeing the gist of your jib.\n\n323\n00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.535\n&gt;&gt; There we go, and\nlet's remove this console.log.\n\n324\n00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:43.897\nAnd here, let's just make it, cuz\nthe canvas object's actually really large.\n\n325\n00:20:43.897 --> 00:20:45.932\nSo these numbers are going to be bigger,\nand\n\n326\n00:20:45.932 --> 00:20:49.130\nthat's something you're like,\nshouldn't that be dynamic?\n\n327\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.940\nIt should, but we're just playing around.\n\n328\n00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.569\nAnd notice I can move very quickly.\n\n329\n00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:55.593\nIt's not super smooth animation, but\n\n330\n00:20:55.593 --> 00:20:59.770\nI have a very large canvas object and\nthere we go.\n\n331\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:05.470\nWe could add an acceleration\nfactor where as I hold down more,\n\n332\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.730\nthat amount gets faster and\nfaster and faster.\n\n333\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.640\nAnd then when I let off, it just stops.\n\n334\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.190\nBut let's keep it simple.\n\n335\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.360\nI can still move pretty quickly.\n\n336\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great.\n\n337\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n338\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.310\nAnd then I could move in front\nof the ball if necessary.\n\n339\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.180\nNow this ball is moving at a pretty\ngood clip for demonstration purposes.\n\n340\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.780\nSo we would have to tweak those later on.\n\n341\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.930\nBut now I have a human controlled\npaddle based on arrow keys, and\n\n342\n00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.780\nwell, that was our ultimate goal for\nthis episode.\n\n343\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.955\nWe've used the base paddle\nobject to only extend.\n\n344\n00:21:37.955 --> 00:21:41.080\nAnd what's amazing is because\nwe have that base paddle object,\n\n345\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.160\nwe didn't have to do as much work.\n\n346\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.170\nWe're just saying, well,\n\n347\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.510\nthere's the paddle,\nlet me just change that a little bit.\n\n348\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:51.761\nHey, well, here's this other paddle,\nlet me just change that a little bit.\n\n349\n00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.169\nAnd if you program like\nthat in JavaScript,\n\n350\n00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:57.710\nI think it's a little easier to\nreason about, me personally.\n\n351\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.756\nNow that may be based on experience and\nyou may not find it that way,\n\n352\n00:22:01.756 --> 00:22:03.498\nso definitely try that out.\n\n353\n00:22:03.498 --> 00:22:06.824\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, is most of the management\ncompleted in the main method here?\n\n354\n00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:10.261\nI mean, have you already addressed\nthat and I just missed it?\n\n355\n00:22:10.261 --> 00:22:14.734\n&gt;&gt; So I think what Zack's getting at is\nwhere is all of the actual management of\n\n356\n00:22:14.734 --> 00:22:15.730\nthe game stuff?\n\n357\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.860\nIt's always gonna be in that main method,\nright?\n\n358\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.260\nWe're hooking up our event listeners,\nthat's gonna be in the main.\n\n359\n00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.078\nBut ultimately, I think we're probably\ngonna pull that out into a game,\n\n360\n00:22:25.078 --> 00:22:26.840\nwhat we could call a game object.\n\n361\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.480\nBut for now, it's just in the app.js.\n\n362\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.930\nSo all of the event handling,\nall of the canvas,\n\n363\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.360\nall of that stuff Is now inside of app.js.\n\n364\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.203\nMost of our other things are going to\nbe pulled out into separate files.\n\n365\n00:22:40.203 --> 00:22:43.228\nWhich actually reminds me if we\nhop back down into my screen here,\n\n366\n00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.590\nwe should probably clean\nthis up a little bit.\n\n367\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.020\nDefinitely clean up after yourself.\n\n368\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.246\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So we have a couple of things,\n\n369\n00:22:49.246 --> 00:22:52.290\nconstants, and\nwe have a HumanPlayerPaddle.\n\n370\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:58.054\nWell, we use the constants in\nthe HumanPlayerPaddle, and\n\n371\n00:22:58.054 --> 00:23:03.368\nthen we use HumanPlayerPaddle\ninside of the app.js.\n\n372\n00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:04.230\nSo let's do this.\n\n373\n00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:09.205\nLet's create another js file, And\n\n374\n00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:14.686\nlet's call that, Player-paddle.\n\n375\n00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:20.968\nAnd let's be consistent,\nhuman-player-paddle,\n\n376\n00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:25.110\nJust like so, and pull this out.\n\n377\n00:23:28.966 --> 00:23:34.218\nSo cut and paste and save.\n\n378\n00:23:34.218 --> 00:23:38.459\nAnd then likewise,\nlet's create another file and\n\n379\n00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:41.820\nsave that, call it constants, right?\n\n380\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.010\nThis may hold all of the constant values,\n\n381\n00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.875\nmaybe things that we want\nto assign to a variable.\n\n382\n00:23:48.875 --> 00:23:52.017\nAnd then use throughout our\napplication as a proxy.\n\n383\n00:23:52.017 --> 00:23:58.535\nI don't wanna remember that every time\nI see a 38, that that's up or down.\n\n384\n00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:01.018\nFor 40, so keys.down.\n\n385\n00:24:01.018 --> 00:24:03.970\nOkay, so just for readability.\n\n386\n00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.930\nSo I'm gonna make a constant.js and\nI'm gonna pull that constant,\n\n387\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.020\nthis particular constant\ninto that constants file.\n\n388\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.280\nNow I'm using kind of this global state,\nnot the greatest, but we'll go with it.\n\n389\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.990\nYou can have a little bit,\nit works for a little bit.\n\n390\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.220\nBut as it stands, I've broken my project,\nso I come back and I refresh,\n\n391\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.580\nit's broke,\nHumanPlayerPaddle is not defined.\n\n392\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.618\nWell, anytime you extract,\n\n393\n00:24:31.618 --> 00:24:36.270\nalways make sure that you add in\nthe appropriate files on your HTML.\n\n394\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.590\nIf you're using a module like WetPack or\nI think it's Rollup, then, well, this\n\n395\n00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.540\nmay not be an issue because that build\n[INAUDIBLE] it's gonna happen for you.\n\n396\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.390\nBut we want to bring in\nthe HumanPlayerPaddle.\n\n397\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.830\nBotice where I placed\nthe HumanPlayerPaddle.\n\n398\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.890\nIt's below paddle,\n\n399\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.940\nbecause the HumanPlayerPaddle\nactually uses the paddle function.\n\n400\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.660\nSo the order does matter.\n\n401\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:08.400\nLikewise, what I'm going to do, and I just\nnoticed that I did a keyboard shortcut.\n\n402\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.202\nIf you come a line and\nCtrl+ Shift + D on Windows and Linux or\n\n403\n00:25:15.202 --> 00:25:20.520\nCmd+ Shift+D on Mac, you'll actually just\nduplicate the line to the next line.\n\n404\n00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.770\nI'm going to change this\nfirst one to constants.\n\n405\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.340\nAnd that way constants are one\nof the first things to load and\n\n406\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.070\nthey would be available\non the files below.\n\n407\n00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.970\nSo, this order matters because it's\nessentially your dependencies.\n\n408\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.540\nIf you ever have trouble figuring\nout which one comes first and\n\n409\n00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.120\nyou can't ever get it to work regardless\nof your order, that means you have what's\n\n410\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.230\nknown as like a wierd kind of circular\npossibly self-referential dependency.\n\n411\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.180\nSo paddle depends on HumanPlayerPaddle,\nwhich depends on paddle.\n\n412\n00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.410\nIf you have that,\nthen things are not gonna work.\n\n413\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.190\nSo we have to be careful of that.\n\n414\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.780\nWe shouldn't have anything of the sort.\n\n415\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.630\nBut if I come back now and\n\n416\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.850\nlook I now have the ability to yay-\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n417\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.458\n&gt;&gt; To almost play pong.\n\n418\n00:26:04.458 --> 00:26:09.460\nNow you'll notice,\nI got some weirdness going on.\n\n419\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.900\nAnd I could spend some time to limit,\nright?\n\n420\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.450\nI had that bounce, I could set up limits.\n\n421\n00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.040\nBut I think until we start building\nthe computer and see where that comes out,\n\n422\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.570\nI think it might be a little premature to\nstart limiting our paddle top and bottom.\n\n423\n00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.610\nBut we definitely need to do that.\n\n424\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.520\nBut we have our HumanPlayerPaddle,\nit's managed by keyboard.\n\n425\n00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.599\nAnd once we get the computer,\nwe need to build a scoreboard and\n\n426\n00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:38.490\nwe're almost in Pong Land.\n\n427\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.612\n&gt;&gt; Creating the HumanPlayerPaddle,\n\n428\n00:26:40.612 --> 00:26:44.012\none more step towards our\ncreation of our homage to Pong.\n\n429\n00:26:44.012 --> 00:26:45.692\nAnything else you'd like\nto add before we go?\n\n430\n00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:48.810\n&gt;&gt; So definitely stay tuned,\nthe computer player\n\n431\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.460\nmight actually kind of interesting\ncuz you can then build strategies.\n\n432\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.941\nSo when I say computer, some strategy's\napplied automatically by the computer,\n\n433\n00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:58.420\nyou're still writing it.\n\n434\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.161\nAnd that can be a little bit of fun and\na little bit adventurous.\n\n435\n00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:05.871\nAnd then that way, we essentially\nhave the pieces that we need for\n\n436\n00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:08.710\na very simple game,\nif we're not keeping score.\n\n437\n00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.280\nWe're probably gonna go a little bit\nbeyond that or we may take that time to\n\n438\n00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.210\nrefactor and actually put in some game\nlogic for limiting the paddles and stuff.\n\n439\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.970\nSo, definitely stay tuned.\n\n440\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Justin, you're doing an awesome job and\nI'm having so much fun.\n\n441\n00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.400\nThe HTML5 Canvas Projects,\nmake sure you see every single episode.\n\n442\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.600\nGo to our course line,\ncheck up the hundreds of videos,\n\n443\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.020\nthey are all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n444\n00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.882\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DEVPRO.TV.\n\n445\n00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:32.210\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n446\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.770\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n447\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin

It is good to be back, and\nhopefully I can show you the way.\n\n9\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.736\n&gt;&gt; I guess we will see.\n\n10\n00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.382\n&gt;&gt; But how are you, Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:38.891\n&gt;&gt; I am great, and I'm excited that\nwe're moving forward with this,\n\n12\n00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:41.737\nbecause every little element\nwe add is just exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:45.460\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we're going to work on\ncreating the computer player paddle.\n\n14\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.281\nNow, what does that entail?\n\n15\n00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.648\nWell, Zach, I think you made\nan observation the other day, right,\n\n16\n00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:55.830\nin a previous episode,\nabout one of our paddles.\n\n17\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.120\nDo you remember that\nobservation that you had?\n\n18\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was wondering, is that player\npaddle, is that the computer paddle?\n\n19\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.403\nI mean, don't we already have that?\n\n20\n00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:04.860\nIsn't that already in place?\n\n21\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.696\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nZach has made a brilliant observation.\n\n22\n00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:11.397\nWe actually have a panel that could\nbe a simple computer strategy, right?\n\n23\n00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:14.570\nIt's just kind of moves up and\ndown, and that's all it does.\n\n24\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.541\nNow, it may be a very easy to beat\ncomputer strategy, once we get to actually\n\n25\n00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:24.536\ncolliding against paddles, and\nhaving them bouncing, things like that.\n\n26\n00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:28.664\nHowever, right now that's\nactually in the paddle, and\n\n27\n00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:32.106\nwe are overriding that\nin the computer player.\n\n28\n00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:35.467\nIt seems like we should\nprobably make a change to that,\n\n29\n00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.380\nin order to have a better organization.\n\n30\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.742\n&gt;&gt; In order for it to be a computer\npaddle itself, and have a functionality,\n\n31\n00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:45.160\nbecause we're gonna be actually doing\nbattle with that computer paddle,\n\n32\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.370\nsooner or later, right?\n\n33\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.549\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I don't think that\nshould be in the paddle for say,\n\n34\n00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.140\nthe paddle should be a little more,\nkind of slim and trim.\n\n35\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.562\nAnd then that strategy should be\nimplemented in what I'm gonna call\n\n36\n00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:58.073\nthe simple computer paddle.\n\n37\n00:01:58.073 --> 00:01:59.323\n&gt;&gt; So what are we gonna do?\n\n38\n00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:02.243\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe need to do some code reorganization in\n\n39\n00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:04.560\norder to make that come to fruition.\n\n40\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.610\nSo I'm gonna try to keep that very\nkind of illustrated, so to speak.\n\n41\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.688\nAnd, well, Zack, if anything seems out\nof place, definitely keep me honest.\n\n42\n00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But do keep in mind,\n\n43\n00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:20.925\nI'm doing some reorganization, building\nsome other things, and I'm gonna make\n\n44\n00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:25.600\nsure to keep this segmented by file, but\nbe very explicit about what I'm doing.\n\n45\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.096\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n46\n00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:30.872\nAnd let's see, we got some mess,\nwe will definitely clean this up later.\n\n47\n00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:36.522\nThis is more about testing, about trying\nto figure out what's going on, right?\n\n48\n00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:39.180\nHow are we going about this?\n\n49\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.500\nWe do have some of these checks that\nI eventually will probably refactor,\n\n50\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.170\nto make them a little more readable.\n\n51\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.420\nBecause yes, this is a condition, but\nI think it could be a little more readable\n\n52\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.970\nand go, if the ball is out left or\nout right, or so to speak.\n\n53\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.982\nHowever, that's not our concern.\n\n54\n00:02:55.982 --> 00:03:01.519\nWhat our concern is, is this paddle,\nthis human player paddle,\n\n55\n00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.660\nis actually an extension of the paddle,\nright?\n\n56\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.641\nSo we take the paddle, and\nwe've done some updates.\n\n57\n00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.063\nNow, if we come over here to paddle,\n\n58\n00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:19.140\nwe change this around to be\na function that returns an object.\n\n59\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.420\nBut if we look,\nsome of these defaults are okay.\n\n60\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.020\nHowever, this portion,\nthis update and this bounce,\n\n61\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.348\nthat's actually makes a little more sense\nif it was a simple computer paddle, right?\n\n62\n00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:34.244\nIt shouldn't be bouncing,\n\n63\n00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:38.990\nit should only be limited if it's\na human player, which we will get to.\n\n64\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.260\nBut for an actual computer paddle,\nthis bounce would work.\n\n65\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.146\nSo in all actuality, as Zach has observed,\n\n66\n00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:54.607\nthis paddle is more of the simple computer\npaddle, and not a slim and trim version.\n\n67\n00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:58.246\nNow, that means we have to go through and\nthink about, for\n\n68\n00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.710\na general paddle, what is necessary?\n\n69\n00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.629\nFor all the paddles,\nregardless of whether it's a human player,\n\n70\n00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.302\nother computer players,\nwhatever it may be, do I need an x?\n\n71\n00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n72\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.775\n&gt;&gt; Do I need a y?\n\n73\n00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:09.287\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Do I need a dy?\n\n74\n00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:10.108\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n75\n00:04:10.108 --> 00:04:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Height, width, color?\n\n76\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.354\nYes, right,\nwe could probably live without color,\n\n77\n00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:16.101\nwe could just leave them at default, but\nat least there's some options there.\n\n78\n00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:20.861\nNow, we have some hard-coded\nvalues that eventually, I think,\n\n79\n00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.197\nwe're probably going to change\nto be a little more dynamic.\n\n80\n00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:31.871\nBecause as it stands, this x and this y,\nthey're always gonna place us to the left,\n\n81\n00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.900\nand actually our computer player\nneeds to be on the right.\n\n82\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.890\nSo we may have to handle that.\n\n83\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.819\nBut this paddle should probably\nnot have this bounce y,\n\n84\n00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.421\nit should probably not\nhave this update function.\n\n85\n00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:54.630\nAnd as a start, I'm gonna build a simple\ncomputer paddle, just right up here.\n\n86\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.299\nI'm gonna build the function\ninside of this add.js.\n\n87\n00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.737\nNow, You'll notice over\nthe previous episodes,\n\n88\n00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:02.921\nthis add.js just kinda gotten big,\nand then we'll pair it down.\n\n89\n00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.952\nGotten big, pair it down.\n\n90\n00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:06.952\nThis makes it a little bit\neasier to keep from switching.\n\n91\n00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:11.416\nEventually, this add.js is gonna be really\ntiny, it's going to be like three lines.\n\n92\n00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:12.249\n&gt;&gt; Lean.\n\n93\n00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.064\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be lean.\n\n94\n00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:16.067\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be,\nyeah, super lean, slim, so\n\n95\n00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:19.973\nto speak, cuz all it's gonna do\nis start the game, and that's it.\n\n96\n00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:22.604\nBut let's call it SimpleComputerPaddle.\n\n97\n00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:28.980\nI'm big on names that, well, give you some\ninsight about what's going on, right?\n\n98\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.706\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n99\n00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:36.008\n&gt;&gt; So if we go here, and\nthis is gonna be a standard function,\n\n100\n00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:43.387\nbecause we're going to return, let's see,\nwe wanna return Object.assign.\n\n101\n00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.380\nAnd we wanna return a Paddle, but\nwe want to overwrite with the changes\n\n102\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.651\nthat we've made, in order to\ncreate a simple computer paddle.\n\n103\n00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.840\nAnd we've done that a little\nbit in the human player paddle.\n\n104\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.234\nI'm gonna do this just a little bit\ndifferently than this in line portion,\n\n105\n00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:05.639\nto bring some clarity.\n\n106\n00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.882\nEventually, I may refactor that.\n\n107\n00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:09.566\nSo that's one of those patterns where\nyou're like, [SOUND] that could be\n\n108\n00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:12.088\na little more readable,\nI should probably do that a different way.\n\n109\n00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:14.460\nSo I'm gonna call this changes.\n\n110\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.496\nNow changes is gonna be an object inside\nof SimpleComputerPaddle, like so.\n\n111\n00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:25.254\nSo as it stands,\nif I was to make a simple computer paddle,\n\n112\n00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:30.040\nI would get no changes, I would actually\njust get a paddle object, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:37.588\nLet's just see that kind of in run, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:41.027\nWe will not see it on the screen,\ncuz I'm not gonna render it or anything,\n\n115\n00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:42.870\njust until we get things squared away.\n\n116\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.991\nSo here's our SimpleComputerPaddle\nthat's gonna return a new object,\n\n117\n00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:53.438\nwhich is console.log(computer),\nso we can do some inspection.\n\n118\n00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:54.230\nAnd there we go.\n\n119\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.570\nAnd if we look,\nit is essentially just a paddle.\n\n120\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.013\nNow, again, we don't see it on the screen,\ncuz it's not rendered, but\n\n121\n00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:03.961\nthere we go, we're good to go.\n\n122\n00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:09.059\nNow, it's not moving about because,\nwell, the inner image of the screen,\n\n123\n00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:14.480\nwe haven't called update, we're not\nmanipulating it inside of the game state.\n\n124\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.610\nHowever, as I said, I like this\nupdate function that we have here,\n\n125\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.840\nand that would actually move us around,\nI would like for\n\n126\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.840\nthat to in the SimpleComputerPaddle.\n\n127\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.673\nAs well as render should already\nbe there from a paddle, but\n\n128\n00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:37.973\nthis bounce y only applies to the\nstrategy, the bouncing from top to bottom.\n\n129\n00:07:37.973 --> 00:07:40.912\nThat's all I need, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:40.912 --> 00:07:45.595\nNow, what that means is I think,\nnow we are probably gonna break\n\n131\n00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:46.651\nsome stuff-\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n132\n00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:48.351\n&gt;&gt; In the meantime, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:51.954\n&gt;&gt; What I think this means is [CROSSTALK]\nthis update should be overwritten.\n\n134\n00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:58.733\nBut more specifically, this bounce,\nI don't think it belongs in paddle.\n\n135\n00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:02.680\nIt's more specific to this particular\nstrategy that we're trying to accomplish.\n\n136\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.590\nSo if we come over here, and\nwe go into changes, and we paste that.\n\n137\n00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.240\nSo now changes is bounceY.\n\n138\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.220\nAnd if I did not apply those changes I\nwould just get a standard paddle that\n\n139\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.270\nwould not be able to\nbounce from top to bottom.\n\n140\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.500\nNow, let's see here, what else?\n\n141\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:29.360\nThis update function that we have inside\nof the paddle, the actual portion.\n\n142\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.660\nI think that should be in\nthe simple computer paddle and\n\n143\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.910\nnot part of a standard paddle.\n\n144\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.360\nSo what we're gonna do is remove that.\n\n145\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.330\nAnd change this over here.\n\n146\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.470\nAnd let's see if we've broken anything\nbefore we get too crazy about this.\n\n147\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.754\nAnd refresh,\nit looks like everything's good.\n\n148\n00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.910\nWe don't have any, if I hit up and\n\n149\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:57.070\ndown over here our human player\npaddle still actually works.\n\n150\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.860\nSo we haven't broken anything about that,\nper se.\n\n151\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.140\nBut we have done some reorganization and\n\n152\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.850\nyou'll notice that the paddle,\nit's a little slimmer, right?.\n\n153\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.942\nAll paddles are rendered the same, cool.\n\n154\n00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:14.830\nAll paddles have an x, y,\ndy, height with color.\n\n155\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.723\nNow, we could go crazy and\nmake this kind of mix-ins or\n\n156\n00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:22.830\ndecorators that say, it is positionable\nwhich means that it has an x and y.\n\n157\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.250\nIt is movable.\n\n158\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.060\nSo it would have a dxdy.\n\n159\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.101\nIt is I don't know, [SOUND] this\nis where it gets a little weird.\n\n160\n00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:34.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the ball has a radius,\n\n161\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.267\nthe paddle has a height and a width.\n\n162\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.170\nSo really, height and\nwidth is something we need for the paddle.\n\n163\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n164\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.700\n&gt;&gt; So, I think I lied a bit.\n\n165\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.540\nWe should probably check to\nsee if it actually works.\n\n166\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.329\nThe one thing though, what's kinda\nweird is, well, we'll just see.\n\n167\n00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:58.150\nSo cuz I think this is\nwhat's gonna happen.\n\n168\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.600\nI think we're not gonna be able\nto position it on the right.\n\n169\n00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.980\nWe're actually gonna be a computer and\na one player all on the left.\n\n170\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:12.889\nSo we now have this computer right here,\nsimple computer paddle.\n\n171\n00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:16.079\nAnd we're gonna come over here and\n\n172\n00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.707\ninstead of paddle.update,\nlet's do computer.update.\n\n173\n00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:25.599\nAnd computer.render.\n\n174\n00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:28.680\nAnd don't forget to pass on\nthe context because that is important.\n\n175\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.458\nNow, you'll notice ball.update,\ncomputer.update, ball.render,\n\n176\n00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.040\nplayer.render, computer.render.\n\n177\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.970\nYou have to be careful about the\norganization of this because you may have\n\n178\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.220\ndifferent rendering kind of overviews.\n\n179\n00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.620\nOr, excuse me, different rendering\nweirdness if you're not careful.\n\n180\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.450\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans.\n\n181\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans,\nshenanigans is a good word.\n\n182\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.730\nSo if we come over here and\n\n183\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.040\nwe refresh you'll notice I actually\nhave another paddle on the left.\n\n184\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.960\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say.\n\n185\n00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.530\nAre we gonna end up with\ntwo paddles on one side?\n\n186\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we are.\n\n187\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.720\nThat's a problem.\n\n188\n00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.330\n&gt;&gt; That's a problem.\n\n189\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n190\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.660\nAnd I could hardcode a value.\n\n191\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.540\nIn these changes I could\ndo something like this.\n\n192\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.750\nLike x, I just wanna change the x.\n\n193\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.650\nBut what do I want to change it to?\n\n194\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.100\nWell, I have to know something about\na canvas but the dimensions and\n\n195\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.150\nthat's dependent on the window\nwhich may actually change in size.\n\n196\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.370\nThat is difficult to say.\n\n197\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.490\nNow, I could do canvas like this.\n\n198\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:38.240\nAnd I could say canvas.width\n\n199\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.532\n[SOUND] minus this.width.\n\n200\n00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:49.390\nBut that gets a little iffy,\ntoo, because is it this .width?\n\n201\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.320\nBecause what is this right here?\n\n202\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.990\nWell, it's the changes and\nchanges doesn't have anything.\n\n203\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.080\nSo we might get a little,\nwe might get a little iffy.\n\n204\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.310\nBut let's look at canvas.width and\nlet's just say minus 30.\n\n205\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.100\nAnd if we refresh now.\n\n206\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do you know?\n\n207\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.760\n&gt;&gt; Now, we moved it over there and\nit's gone now.\n\n208\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.005\nIt doesn't actually bounce.\n\n209\n00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:13.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n210\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.500\nthat's because we're not checking for-\n&gt;&gt; It just resets.\n\n211\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually goes in the same\ndirection forever and ever and ever.\n\n212\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.058\n&gt;&gt; It's in infinity then.\n\n213\n00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all the way over there.\n\n214\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.960\nThat brings up a couple of good points.\n\n215\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.260\nWe're building the paddle that\nwe're extending from, right?\n\n216\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.440\nWe're kind of starting with this\nbase object and adding things on it.\n\n217\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.290\nThink of a, well,\nthat's a chocolate cake, yeah, but\n\n218\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.055\nI put cream cheese frosting on it.\n\n219\n00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:38.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's a better chocolate cake.\n\n220\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.803\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n221\n00:12:39.803 --> 00:12:41.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sounds good to me.\n\n222\n00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:43.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's kind\nof what we're doing,\n\n223\n00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.590\nwe're adding things on to build\nup the object that we need.\n\n224\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.140\nSo that brings up a couple of good points.\n\n225\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.320\nHowever, Zach,\nI do have a question for you.\n\n226\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.720\n&gt;&gt; I might have a question for you.\n\n227\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.060\n&gt;&gt; Do you see anything weird about this\npaddle object now that we've changed it?\n\n228\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.039\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nshould the paddle update be empty?\n\n229\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.330\nYes, see, we were on it.\n\n230\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.130\n&gt;&gt; That's the question.\n\n231\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.750\n&gt;&gt; He was like, I got it, I see something.\n\n232\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.176\n&gt;&gt; But I was thinking about the cream\ncheese and chocolate cake and so\n\n233\n00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:12.890\nI got distracted.\n\n234\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.817\n&gt;&gt; Understandably, ooh, cream cheese.\n\n235\n00:13:15.817 --> 00:13:19.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the paddle objects update, right?\n\n236\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is empty and\nwe don't have abstract methods.\n\n237\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.822\nWe have no way to enforce\ninterfaces in JavaScript.\n\n238\n00:13:25.822 --> 00:13:28.150\nWe can kind of have all this dynamicism.\n\n239\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.730\nI like to keep this empty\n\n240\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.170\nbecause then it doesn't break if I\naccidentally construct a paddle.\n\n241\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.180\nReally, I shouldn't be constructing\na standard paddle as a means of,\n\n242\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.710\nthat's what it is, right?\n\n243\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.030\nAs just using it.\n\n244\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.140\nHowever, if I were to,\nI wouldn't throw errors.\n\n245\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.520\nI could do something different and\nsay, well, here is the base paddle,\n\n246\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.452\nthis is like a paddle scaffolding.\n\n247\n00:13:51.452 --> 00:13:55.280\nYou have to add at least an update method.\n\n248\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.950\nWhat I am gonna do is keep it from\nthrowing errors and breaking things and\n\n249\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.080\nnot rendering.\n\n250\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.260\nI'm gonna leave the update there.\n\n251\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.990\nAnd as it runs, well, guess what?\n\n252\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.190\nIt does nothing.\n\n253\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.860\nSo if I were to do that,\nit wouldn't break.\n\n254\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.820\nIt would still show.\n\n255\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.390\nIt would just not run appropriately.\n\n256\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.720\nNow, that's my decision.\n\n257\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.210\nThat's not necessarily the only\ndecision that you can make.\n\n258\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:20.370\nYou kinda get some leniency\nwith how those are implemented.\n\n259\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.655\nBut we don't have any way to\nimplement that programmatically.\n\n260\n00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:24.250\nBecause this is like, whatever,\n\n261\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.318\nthe method's not there or update's not\na function if update wasn't there.\n\n262\n00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:32.070\nSo I'm gonna leave that empty but then\nI'm going to say every other panel that I\n\n263\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.550\nimplement as an extension to the standard\npaddle object is going to have to override\n\n264\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.320\nthe update object, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.030\nSo, there's that.\n\n266\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.280\nIn addition to,\nI wanna touch on one thing,\n\n267\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.480\nwe're building this in place and\nthat's perfectly fine here.\n\n268\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.336\nBut you may find some limitations\nas we just did here where\n\n269\n00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:59.004\nit may be better to have\nthe paddle available early on.\n\n270\n00:14:59.004 --> 00:15:01.280\nBecause then you can make\nit a little more dynamic.\n\n271\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, so instead of -30,\nI could say paddle.width.\n\n272\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.416\nSo I can actually move it all the way off\nthe camp and then move it back the width,\n\n273\n00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:11.910\nso it's right up against it.\n\n274\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.170\nAnd that's if it's on the right.\n\n275\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.225\nThese are, we're gonna adopt a convention.\n\n276\n00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:21.100\nHuman-player paddles, whatever\nthe strength, maybe they move fast or\n\n277\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.930\nwhatnot, they're on the left.\n\n278\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.620\nThey're on my left which\nthe perspective's different.\n\n279\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.470\nAnd then computer paddles\nare gonna be on the right.\n\n280\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.380\nSo doing that,\nyou may have to do something like,\n\n281\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.980\nI can either move it all the over or\nmove it back a little bit.\n\n282\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.610\nBut then, that's not the case for\nthe human-player paddles, you can actually\n\n283\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.180\njust move them right up to 0 because\nthen the direction has changed.\n\n284\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.277\nAnd that's because the reference for\na rectangle is the upper left-hand corner.\n\n285\n00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.253\nThere's one final thing\nthat would be an issue.\n\n286\n00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:53.651\nSo I'm going to put this paddle back.\n\n287\n00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.630\nI've constructed the paddle\nobject early on.\n\n288\n00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.536\nAnd what I've done is I've essentially\nsaid, Here are all my ingredients.\n\n289\n00:15:59.536 --> 00:16:05.140\nThis object.assign is going to go,\nlet's squish all those together.\n\n290\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Squishing is good.\n\n291\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.170\n&gt;&gt; Squish them all together.\n\n292\n00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.489\nNow, if this paddle object\nwas single object literal,\n\n293\n00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:14.736\nI would not do this because it would\nactually change the paddle object.\n\n294\n00:16:14.736 --> 00:16:20.291\nBut since this is a function that returns\nnew paddle objects every time I call it,\n\n295\n00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:21.280\nI can do this.\n\n296\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.190\nSo just be careful about that if you use\nthe left paddle equals curly braces,\n\n297\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.720\nlike we did early on for the ball.\n\n298\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.320\nYou may get some weird behavior,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n299\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Okey dokey.\n\n300\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.189\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to move this\ninto another file, and\n\n301\n00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:40.840\nwell we're gonna see\nsomething interesting happen.\n\n302\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:47.330\nI'm gonna move this and cut it, and\nI'm gonna create another file and\n\n303\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.292\nthat file is going to be\nsimplecomputerpaddle.js.\n\n304\n00:16:52.292 --> 00:16:53.840\nI'm just going to place that there.\n\n305\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.080\nDon't forget to put it in your index.html.\n\n306\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.180\nAnd it does rely on paddle.\n\n307\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:09.155\nOkay, so\nscript src=js/simple-computer-paddle,\n\n308\n00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:12.117\nlike that, okay.\n\n309\n00:17:12.117 --> 00:17:13.535\nSo there's simple-computer-paddle.\n\n310\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.690\nAnd you're like, that will all work,\n\n311\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.680\nand let's make sure everything's saved and\nit will be all good.\n\n312\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.154\nAnd it kinda is, right.\n\n313\n00:17:22.154 --> 00:17:23.130\n&gt;&gt; Kinda is.\n\n314\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.510\n&gt;&gt; And why is that?\n\n315\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.072\nWell if we come over here\nto simple computer paddle,\n\n316\n00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:30.869\nit makes a reference to Canvas.\n\n317\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.390\nAnd let me just show you what I mean.\n\n318\n00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.910\nIf I were to grab this and\n\n319\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.530\nlet's say I start constructing\nthese objects early on, right.\n\n320\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.680\nI wanna get the paddle and all that.\n\n321\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:51.702\nBroke, and that's because the function\ncall that constructs this object,\n\n322\n00:17:51.702 --> 00:17:55.660\nthis is pulled into the global name space.\n\n323\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.976\nCanvas is available when this is called,\nhowever, if the Canvas,\n\n324\n00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:05.361\nthe Canvas variable, wow,\nforgot the word variable,\n\n325\n00:18:05.361 --> 00:18:09.770\nis not available when this is called,\nyour app breaks.\n\n326\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.598\nSo that almost seems to be a dependency,\nright.\n\n327\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.287\nA computer paddle needs to\nknow about the Canvas, okay.\n\n328\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.170\nAnd that actually might be something\nthat we need to do for all of these.\n\n329\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.910\nHowever, we're gonna do it for\nthe simple computer paddle for\n\n330\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.450\nnow because we're gonna do some\nrefactoring a little later on.\n\n331\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:36.370\nI'm gonna pass in the Canvas here, and now\nthis Canvas is scoped to this function.\n\n332\n00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.530\nIt needs to be passed in,\nthat helps me enforce that\n\n333\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.685\nI can't construct a computer paddle\nuntil there's a Canvas that exists.\n\n334\n00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:46.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n335\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:52.632\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna pass in the Canvas like\nso, and everything is a-okay, okay.\n\n336\n00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n337\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.790\nAlso, I noticed there's some\nweirdness going on here, I think.\n\n338\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.780\nYeah, we kinda need to move that back\na little more, like a buffer agent, right.\n\n339\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.919\n&gt;&gt; Spread it out a bit.\n\n340\n00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.870\nSo we're just make a little tweak here.\n\n341\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.430\nMinus 20, right,\nthat's kind of our buffer.\n\n342\n00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.292\nAnd there we go.\n\n343\n00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a little better.\n\n344\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.720\nNow we can always come back and\ntweak those or make that optional.\n\n345\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.920\nBut keep in mind, by adding this Canvas\nas a past argument as a requirement,\n\n346\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.408\nas a required kind of argument,\nit breaks if you don't put it in.\n\n347\n00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:35.294\nWhich helps me remember, hey, I need to\nconstruct a Canvas before I can construct\n\n348\n00:19:35.294 --> 00:19:38.720\na paddle because without a Canvas\nthere's no point in having a paddle.\n\n349\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, Canvas can do miracles.\n\n350\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and so, don't do that.\n\n351\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.170\nWe're going to put that back in there,\nmove this over and\n\n352\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.580\nnow we have this simple computer panel.\n\n353\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.150\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\nif I come down here and look,\n\n354\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.820\nthis player, well this isn't actually\nthe player that needs to bounce anymore.\n\n355\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:06.150\nLet's do one more thing to\nmake sure everything works.\n\n356\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.490\nAnd now we have a computer\nthat we can play against.\n\n357\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.250\nRight, it moves up and down.\n\n358\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.630\nAnd let me move this over so\nit's not behind my head here.\n\n359\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.780\nSo we now have this player, and\n\n360\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.320\nif this screen was this small then that\nwould be a really fast ball to play.\n\n361\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.740\n&gt;&gt; That would be real fast.\n\n362\n00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.786\n&gt;&gt; So we would have to tweak that.\n\n363\n00:20:23.786 --> 00:20:27.715\nBut notice this is now bouncing, and\n\n364\n00:20:27.715 --> 00:20:32.650\nthen I can also move my battle like so.\n\n365\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:33.750\n&gt;&gt; So we're getting closer.\n\n366\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.620\n&gt;&gt; We're getting closer.\n\n367\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.540\nThere's no collision detection,\nbut there is a simple strategy.\n\n368\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.620\nWe actually happened upon this simple\nstrategy from the outset of testing\n\n369\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.864\nthe paddle, just out of circumstance.\n\n370\n00:20:43.864 --> 00:20:46.907\nBut we did a little bit of refactoring\nhere to actually make it the simple\n\n371\n00:20:46.907 --> 00:20:49.730\ncomputer paddle, and\nthen we don't have to worry about it.\n\n372\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.580\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, that is a simple strategy.\n\n373\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.850\nCan we do other strategies?\n\n374\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.360\n&gt;&gt; We can, and\nlet me set the scene for you.\n\n375\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.840\nI'm pretty sure you could beat this one,\nright, this one isn't moving fast.\n\n376\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.550\nNow if we turned up the wick, so to speak,\nand just made this move really fast,\n\n377\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.335\nthen it's kind of like it's nowhere and\neverywhere at the same time.\n\n378\n00:21:11.335 --> 00:21:12.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But as it stands,\n\n379\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.939\nthis one wouldn't be hard to beat.\n\n380\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.700\nHowever, what if every so\noften it got a little bigger?\n\n381\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.625\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; And then three\n\n382\n00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:25.090\nseconds later it got just a little bit\nbigger until a certain limit, right.\n\n383\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.494\nIf we filled up the entire space,\nwell that would become.\n\n384\n00:21:28.494 --> 00:21:30.233\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well you're not playing\n\n385\n00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:30.847\ncricket now lad.\n\n386\n00:21:30.847 --> 00:21:31.557\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n387\n00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:37.450\nI think that would be interesting\nto see how we would implement that.\n\n388\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.880\nBecause there's probably a couple of,\nthat's, because I still want it to move,\n\n389\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.970\nbut I also want it to get bigger.\n\n390\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.370\nAnd I think that would be nice to see\nhow can we extend to more strategies,\n\n391\n00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.230\nright, to different strategies.\n\n392\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.000\nAnd you could always go crazy and\nlet the paddle know about the ball, and\n\n393\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.730\nthen track the ball, and things that.\n\n394\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.370\nBut I might leave that to an exercise,\nbut the growing paddle, maybe we'll come\n\n395\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.920\nback to that in a part two and actually\nimplement the growing paddle so to speak.\n\n396\n00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.210\n&gt;&gt; So creating the computer\nplayer paddle part two?\n\n397\n00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.890\nSeems like that just might happen,\nand has been part one.\n\n398\n00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.694\nJustin, before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n399\n00:22:11.694 --> 00:22:15.886\n&gt;&gt; Well as you recognize, we're getting\ncloser to actually having a game, right.\n\n400\n00:22:15.886 --> 00:22:17.370\nWhat do we have left?\n\n401\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.550\nWell we need collision for the paddles,\nwe need some way to keep score,\n\n402\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.910\nwe probably need to clean up\nour code a little bit, and\n\n403\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.190\nwe'll now have all of those planned out,\nwell, in store for you.\n\n404\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.530\nSo definitely stay tuned, don't miss them.\n\n405\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.810\n&gt;&gt; And we do need to eat a cream\ncheese iced chocolate cake as well.\n\n406\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.070\nSo make sure you see every single\nHTML5 Canvas projects episode, and\n\n407\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.600\ncheck out our course library.\n\n408\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.160\nAny of the hundreds and hundreds and\n\n409\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.520\nthousands of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n410\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.040\nAnd make sure you tell everybody you know\nabout DevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n411\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.320\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n412\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.773\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n413\n00:22:51.773 --> 00:22:59.750\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n",

Yeah,\nit's funny you should say I'm the one and\n\n11\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.475\nonly, I know another Justin Dennison.\n\n12\n00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:38.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n13\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy, for\nsome reason that just popped into my mind.\n\n14\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.620\nOne of the Justin Dennisons.\n\n15\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920\nBefore we worry about that\nhow are you today Zach?\n\n16\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm great and I'm excited and\nthis has been a wonderful series.\n\n17\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.470\nAnd I want to see how we progress,\nlet's continue on.\n\n18\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.920\nHey, I do have a question for you though.\n\n19\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.210\nYou mentioned before about growing\nthe paddle, and changing it's size.\n\n20\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.020\nWhat exactly does that mean?\n\n21\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet me further clarify my idea right.\n\n22\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.030\nI left off in a previous episode talking\nabout here's a strategy I have in my mind.\n\n23\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910\nI like just coming up with\nthese random strategies.\n\n24\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.420\nI'm not saying they're optimal strategies,\n\n25\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.460\nthese are not an analysis of strategic\ndefense or whatever it may be.\n\n26\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160\nBut I like to be a little\ncreative in this right, so\n\n27\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.430\nI was thinking if I'm moving about and\nsomeone figures out how to beat them.\n\n28\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.890\nWhat's one thing that I can do that\nwould change the dynamic of that\n\n29\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.460\ninteraction right?\n\n30\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.190\nIf I'm the player and\nthat's the computer yeah,\n\n31\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.850\nif I hit it this way,\nthen it's always gonna happen.\n\n32\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.930\nNow the bounce dynamics that we have\nin our game are fairly simplistic.\n\n33\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.290\nIf I'm moving up, I'm not gonna\ngive additional acceleration, so\n\n34\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.130\nwe're keeping this very simple for\njust a matter of learning, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.020\nHowever what if, after you're like aw,\nI'm consistently winning.\n\n36\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.920\nWhat if every so often,\nthe paddle just gets a little bit bigger?\n\n37\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.690\nAnd I'm thinking,\nif we do this suddenly enough,\n\n38\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.710\nit's gonna be hard to catch on\nthat the paddle's getting bigger.\n\n39\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.240\n&gt;&gt; So you're like, did that get bigger?\n\n40\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.190\nI don't know, I'm just gonna keep playing.\n\n41\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.080\nIs it bigger again?\n\n42\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.687\nSo I like to see,\nhey how big is it getting right?\n\n43\n00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.153\nNow with that said,\n\n44\n00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:25.270\nI think there's some finite limit\nthat we should place on there.\n\n45\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.610\nHow big should it get,\ncan it get the whole screen height?\n\n46\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.900\nCan it fill the entire canvas?\n\n47\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.720\nCuz then you can never win right?\n\n48\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.165\nThat's like going I'm going to beat\nthis wall at tennis, no you're not.\n\n49\n00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:40.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Also how often should it get big?\n\n50\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.140\nHow much should it grow?\n\n51\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.830\nBut it's a very simple kind of change on\nthe simple computer panel that we built in\n\n52\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.290\npart one that would allow us to\nchange the dynamics of play.\n\n53\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.430\nAnd possibly a change in\ndifficulty levels so to speak,\n\n54\n00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.000\nso,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n55\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.750\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of my thought process\nof what's our next computer strategy.\n\n56\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.090\nAnd hopefully it gives you,\nhey I have this thing that I can change\n\n57\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.400\none aspect of it and\nmake something different right?\n\n58\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.770\nCan I change, maybe it changes the speed,\nit slowly speeds up.\n\n59\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.080\nIt can be another thing.\n\n60\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.776\nSo I'm trying to give you a way\nto implement your own creative\n\n61\n00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:22.040\nversions of the computer strategy.\n\n62\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.600\n&gt;&gt; Options, options, options.\n\n63\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n64\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.110\n&gt;&gt; One more thing too, are we gonna\nuse the human player paddle or\n\n65\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.390\nthe computer player paddle as a platform?\n\n66\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.620\n&gt;&gt; So we could use the paddle,\nwe could use the human player paddle, or\n\n67\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.298\nwe could use the simple\ncomputer player paddle.\n\n68\n00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:40.655\nSimple computer paddle,\nI think there's no player in there.\n\n69\n00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's simple.\n\n70\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.566\n&gt;&gt; There's a whole lot there,\nnaming is hard, but\n\n71\n00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:50.743\nI want to preserve\nthe movement aspect right.\n\n72\n00:03:50.743 --> 00:03:56.122\nNot by keyboard shortcuts,\nI don't want it to not move.\n\n73\n00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.110\nI actually want it to move like\nin a simple computer paddle.\n\n74\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.670\nSo what I'm going to do is\nuse that as my scaffold.\n\n75\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.881\nSo if you think about it, I have my\npaddle, and I lay it on top of that.\n\n76\n00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:10.430\nAnd if we go with the cake analogy,\nI have my cake which is my paddle.\n\n77\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.500\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; And then I put my cream cheese icing\n\n78\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.620\non there,\nwhich was my simple computer paddle.\n\n79\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.340\nAnd now I'm just gonna put some sprinkles,\nactually crushed up Heath bars,\n\n80\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.520\nright on top of there.\n\n81\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.020\nAnd that's going to be my\ngrowing paddle right, boom.\n\n82\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.408\n&gt;&gt; I know what I'm doing\nafter this episode.\n\n83\n00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:33.304\n[LAUGH] There's a vending\nmachine with my name on it.\n\n84\n00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I made Zach hungry.\n\n85\n00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:39.830\nSo what I could so is I could remake\nthe cake and put icing on it again.\n\n86\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.840\nBut I already have the cake with icing\non it, the simple computer paddle.\n\n87\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.405\nI just need to put the sprinkles on it.\n\n88\n00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Ah-ha!\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna use the simple computer\n\n89\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.130\npaddle as a platform to build\nthis growing computer paddle.\n\n90\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.940\nSo that's kinda my thought process and\n\n91\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.290\nthat's actually a very good observation so\nto speak.\n\n92\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.600\nSo I think now Zack,\nif you have no objections,\n\n93\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.140\nwe should probably go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n94\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.970\n&gt;&gt; Get started on here.\n\n95\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.010\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n97\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.008\nAnd this is where we left off, we had\nthis simple paddle moving up and down.\n\n98\n00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:16.920\nAnd how our SimpleComputerPaddle\ntakes the canvas object,\n\n99\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.610\nbecause it needs to be able to\narrange itself within the canvas.\n\n100\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.970\nAnd as I said in the previous episode,\n\n101\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.000\nwe'll probably do some changes around and\nmake this a little more uniform.\n\n102\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.160\nBut If you're starting to learn,\nit's hard to pre-plan everything.\n\n103\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.760\nYou're gonna say,\nI see this needs to happen.\n\n104\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.188\nLet's go back and change that.\n\n105\n00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:41.250\nNow the SimpleComputerPaddle,\nthat's gonna be our platform.\n\n106\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.485\nBut what I want is\na growing computer paddle.\n\n107\n00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n108\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:53.230\n&gt;&gt; So\nI'm gonna say const GrowingComputerPaddle.\n\n109\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.520\nAnd what does that need?\n\n110\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.290\nWell, we'll not worry about it for\nnow, and there we go.\n\n111\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.911\nAnd then I'm going to return\nObject.assign as I always\n\n112\n00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:07.290\nhave in these kind of constructions.\n\n113\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.072\nAnd I'm gonna formention,\n\n114\n00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:13.270\nthere's a bunch of different\nways to get similar behaviors.\n\n115\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.440\nI don't know if I've\nmade this entirely clear.\n\n116\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.006\nThe object that I've assigned\nis fairly new but it's something\n\n117\n00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:23.838\nthat allows me to think of, I'm composing\nnot truly as in mathematical composition.\n\n118\n00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:25.816\nBut I'm taking these individual pieces and\n\n119\n00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:28.120\nI'm kind of layering them\non top of each other.\n\n120\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.990\nYou can do that a bunch of different ways.\n\n121\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.990\nYou have the class that was introduced\nin new versions of JavaScript so\n\n122\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.880\nI could build classes that\ninherit from each other.\n\n123\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.950\nI could use old constructor\nfunctions that call other functions,\n\n124\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.340\nI can change the prototype.\n\n125\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.080\nI can do a bunch of things.\n\n126\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.290\nI think this is a little easier to think\nabout the layering effect, for me anyway.\n\n127\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.090\nSo I would love to hear from you\nif you find that to be different.\n\n128\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.114\nSo here's our GrowingComputerPaddle and\n\n129\n00:06:56.114 --> 00:06:58.708\nwe're going to simulate in\na SimpleComputerPaddle.\n\n130\n00:06:58.708 --> 00:07:00.059\nNotice we made the paddle first.\n\n131\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.577\nAnd then because we might\nneed to use it righ?.\n\n132\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.680\nWell I want to make the,\nwhere did I go, there we go.\n\n133\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.470\nI want to make the paddle and\nI'm still gonna call it paddle.\n\n134\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.440\nBut notice SimpleComputerPaddle\nis a type of paddle so\n\n135\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.700\nI'm not gonna name\nthe variables differently.\n\n136\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.790\nSo SimpleComputerPaddle but we know that\nthe canvas is needed as an argument.\n\n137\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.550\nOr if I need to construct\nsomething internal to\n\n138\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.502\nthis kinda function that's\nbuilding our object.\n\n139\n00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:38.040\nThe GrowingComputerPaddle also needs\nthe canvas passed in as an argument,\n\n140\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.610\nbecause I'm gonna need it to\nconstruct something else, right?\n\n141\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.050\nIt's kind of like, what tools and\n\n142\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.990\ncollection of goods do I\nneed in order to make it?\n\n143\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.650\nYou can't make cream cheese icing\nwithout cream cheese, right?\n\n144\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.202\nSo that's kind of the thought process.\n\n145\n00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:55.129\n&gt;&gt; You can use tofu, but\nit's gonna be nearly as good.\n\n146\n00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:59.024\n&gt;&gt; That is, nearly as good?\n\n147\n00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:00.410\nI don't even know if I would use nearly.\n\n148\n00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But But that's my opinion,\n\n149\n00:08:01.572 --> 00:08:02.411\nthat's my opinion.\n\n150\n00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:06.670\nSo we're gonna make this changes object\nand well, let's just go ahead and\n\n151\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.830\nput these in place.\n\n152\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.230\nSo paddle and changes, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.747\nSo we should be able to construct\na growing computer paddle as it stands,\n\n154\n00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:19.572\nlet's change out our computer player here.\n\n155\n00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:26.216\nRight there, and everything still stays\nthe same, because technically all we've\n\n156\n00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:29.970\ndone is build a simple computer panel,\nnot changed anything.\n\n157\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n158\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.100\n&gt;&gt; And then boom, there we go, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.290\nSo if we refresh, and look,\nit still behaves exactly as it did.\n\n160\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now also just as a reminder,\n\n161\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.310\nwe have some other methods\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n162\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.450\nWe gotta be careful.\n\n163\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.430\nWe have bounceY, right,\nthat's gonna do our bouncing.\n\n164\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.860\nAnd we have update, so\nthose are coming along for the ride.\n\n165\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.100\nUnless we reuse those names,\nthen those are going to be changed, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.120\nSo let's think about this,\n\n167\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.670\nI'm thinking that we probably need some\nadditional attributes for these changes.\n\n168\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.730\nWe need not only the x and the y and\nthe dy and the color and things\n\n169\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.240\nof that nature, but we probably need-\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it.\n\n170\n00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it.\n\n171\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.070\n&gt;&gt; Let's see a last change,\n\n172\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.850\nand as soon as this constructed I just\nwanna grab the date that is right now.\n\n173\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.950\nSo I need to keep track of time because\nI don't want it to grow real fast.\n\n174\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.180\nI actually want it to go\nit's been three seconds.\n\n175\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.660\nI'm thinking three seconds is pretty good.\n\n176\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.940\nWe'll need some tweaking, but\nspeaking of that, I think maybe the grow\n\n177\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.900\ntime is three and this is going to\nbe seconds before the next growth.\n\n178\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:01.190\nSo there's that, I think we're\ngoing to need that and then what?\n\n179\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.352\nIf it's going to change how\nmuch should it change by?\n\n180\n00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:08.520\nSo dHeight and\n\n181\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.060\nI'm thinking because of how big it is,\n200.\n\n182\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.630\nBut these are hard coded so\nI'm just trying to get a feel for\n\n183\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.310\nthis, since we had the canvas object,\nright?\n\n184\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.660\nWe could make it dynamic based on\nthe relative size of the canvas, but\n\n185\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.970\nlet's just get it working first and\n\n186\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.924\nthen we'll worry about that probably\nduring our later refactoring phase.\n\n187\n00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:34.826\nAnd then height limit,\nI'm thinking that it's probably,\n\n188\n00:10:34.826 --> 00:10:41.767\nyou know what excuse me, this just hit me,\nthat's a giant growth spurt\n\n189\n00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:46.280\n[LAUGH] [SOUND] What I meant to say was-\n&gt;&gt; You ate a lot of chocolate?\n\n190\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.250\n&gt;&gt; What I meant to say was is\nthe height should be kept I\n\n191\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:57.050\nthink at the very,\nlet's just say 500 pixels.\n\n192\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.920\nNow I know my canvas is\nfairly large comparatively,\n\n193\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.350\nactually let's cut it down just a little.\n\n194\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.440\nLet's go 400 pixels and\nagain this is a one to one scale.\n\n195\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.480\nI haven't changed the scale to context.\n\n196\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.370\nSo this is how my reason.\n\n197\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.210\nIf you do change that,\nthen things get a little wierd.\n\n198\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.380\nAnd then, you know,\nin order to make this work,\n\n199\n00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.220\nwe're probably gonna have to\nchange the update function.\n\n200\n00:11:18.607 --> 00:11:24.915\nBut now when we've run into a problem,\nif we change the update function,\n\n201\n00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:31.140\nthat is going to change the behavior\nof the movement, that is a problem.\n\n202\n00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:39.476\nWhat I want is maybe just to grab\nthe SimpleComputerPaddle and\n\n203\n00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:43.100\nmove that over, right?\n\n204\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.350\nSo what is the update function\nof the SimpleComputerPaddle do?\n\n205\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.290\nIt's actually doing the movement for us.\n\n206\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.910\nSo now we don't have to alias.\n\n207\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.330\n&gt;&gt; So why is that necessary?\n\n208\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.470\nIs that necessary?\n\n209\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.590\n&gt;&gt; Actually, let's do this Zach.\n\n210\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.545\nIt is necessary.\n\n211\n00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:02.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n212\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Let's say that I, well in my experience\nwe may see some kind of magic here.\n\n213\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.110\nWhat I would like to do is essentially\nthis, I want to run the paddle update.\n\n214\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.720\nBut what that's gonna do is\nnow that this is returned,\n\n215\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.850\nmy paddle update is effectively going\nto be the update of this object.\n\n216\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.560\nBecause I've kind of smushed\nall of them together.\n\n217\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.563\nSo what this will do is it'll say call\nupdate, hey immediately call update,\n\n218\n00:12:31.563 --> 00:12:36.139\ncall update, call update, and we'll get a\nrecursive kind of call stack shenanigans.\n\n219\n00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:39.139\nIn order to not have that happen,\n\n220\n00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:45.590\nwhat I really want is paddle.update,\nI want to kind of alias that.\n\n221\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.720\n&gt;&gt; So I can still use it,\nI'm grabbing that method, and\n\n223\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.520\nreally it is more about moving.\n\n224\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.105\nSo I'm going to alias that and say hey,\n\n225\n00:12:56.105 --> 00:13:00.400\npaddle.update is moved now because\nthat's a simple computer paddle.\n\n226\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.870\nAnd if we come over to simple computer\npaddle, there it is, that's it.\n\n227\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.070\nSo I just want this function.\n\n228\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:12.230\nAnd instead of having to retype that and\nboom, I'm just gonna alias it.\n\n229\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:18.110\nAnd now I can say this.move like so,\nand here we go.\n\n230\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.980\nI'm going to show you these\ntwo respective things.\n\n231\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.517\nIt's still moving,\nlike that, okay, all right.\n\n232\n00:13:25.517 --> 00:13:29.900\nAnd I just realized that I\naccidentally made the height.\n\n233\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.520\nHere, I meant for this to be height limit.\n\n234\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.490\nI actually said, how much can it grow to?\n\n235\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.630\nAnd I forgot to put lim in here, so\nit made it giant right off the bat.\n\n236\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.110\n&gt;&gt; Giant.\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I want.\n\n237\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.820\nSo notice the moving's still working, but\n\n238\n00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.260\nthat's because I've aliased this and I'm\ncalling it inside of the update function.\n\n239\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now the reason that still works is\n\n240\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.525\nbecause the this keyword,\nin the context of this,\n\n241\n00:13:54.525 --> 00:13:59.860\nof the growing computer paddle\nobject is the computer.\n\n242\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.920\nThe growing computer battle object,\nso this changes context, so\n\n243\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.760\nI'm kind leveraging that.\n\n244\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.050\nSo upon move, you know I'm thinking,\n\n245\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:16.500\nI probably need to see how long it's\nbeen since the last time we've grown.\n\n246\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.140\nLet's call it deltaTime and\nI'm going to say math.abs.\n\n247\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.670\nI'm using absolute so\nI don't have to worry about figuring out.\n\n248\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.020\nI just want to know the magnitude.\n\n249\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.900\nHow long has it been,\n\n250\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.982\nit doesn't matter whether I accidentally\nsubtract them in the wrong order.\n\n251\n00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:39.690\nThis.lastChange- date.now.\n\n252\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.910\nAnd you know what,\n\n253\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:47.670\nI'm pretty sure this gives me like\na weird seconds, or milliseconds, so\n\n254\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.290\nI want seconds, because I wanna be able to\nreason about it in seconds, fairly close.\n\n255\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.122\nNow, this is gonna sacrifice some\nprecision, but I'm okay with that.\n\n256\n00:14:55.122 --> 00:15:00.615\nSo now if(deltaTime &gt; this.growTime\n\n257\n00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:06.916\n&amp;&amp; this.height &lt; this.heightLimit) so\n\n258\n00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:15.325\nI'm guaranteeing because this\nis a paddle that has a height.\n\n259\n00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:16.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n260\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, because the simple\ncomputer paddle has a height, and\n\n261\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.820\nthat's an attribute that\nI haven't overwritten.\n\n262\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.870\nSo I'm guaranteeing that because this\nchocolate cake is made of chocolate,\n\n263\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.902\nI'm guaranteeing that.\n\n264\n00:15:25.902 --> 00:15:26.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cacao.\n\n265\n00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Cacao, so\nI want to increment the height\n\n266\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.610\nby whatever I've set as\nthe change in height, dHeight.\n\n267\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.422\nAnd then this last change, right?\n\n268\n00:15:40.422 --> 00:15:45.075\nWhen was the last time it changed,\nI actually need to update that\n\n269\n00:15:45.075 --> 00:15:50.171\nbecause it's now, right now,\nit's not upon object construction.\n\n270\n00:15:50.171 --> 00:15:54.329\nSo date.now as such and as a result,\n\n271\n00:15:54.329 --> 00:16:00.634\nwe should see over time this\nkind of slowly get bigger and\n\n272\n00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:04.806\nbigger and bigger And so let's see.\n\n273\n00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:10.748\nSo if I'm moving and is it getting\nbigger and bigger and bigger?\n\n274\n00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:14.176\nIt kind of looks like it's getting\nbigger and bigger and bigger to me.\n\n275\n00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:16.621\nBut how can we make sure, cuz it's got\na lot of movement and stuff, right?\n\n276\n00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:19.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So here's what I'd recommend.\n\n277\n00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:21.504\nI wanna keep that movement but for now,\n\n278\n00:16:21.504 --> 00:16:25.374\nI'm just gonna remove the move\npart to see, is it getting bigger?\n\n279\n00:16:25.374 --> 00:16:26.157\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n280\n00:16:26.157 --> 00:16:29.910\n&gt;&gt; So is it getting bigger?\n\n281\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw it move.\n\n282\n00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n&gt;&gt; It moves a little bit.\n\n283\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.425\n&gt;&gt; It did, didn't it?\n\n284\n00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:36.454\nThere it was.\n\n285\n00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.000\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n286\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.719\n&gt;&gt; So it's really subtle and this is-\n&gt;&gt; It is very subtle.\n\n287\n00:16:39.719 --> 00:16:41.921\n&gt;&gt; The trickery of this strategy.\n\n288\n00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:43.124\n&gt;&gt; It's shenanigans.\n\n289\n00:16:43.124 --> 00:16:48.299\n&gt;&gt; Because it's moving and we have\nthat trail, is that getting bigger?\n\n290\n00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.975\nI can't tell, but now that it's\nsitting still you can actually see.\n\n291\n00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:51.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can.\n\n292\n00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:52.773\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYou move straight across,\n\n293\n00:16:52.773 --> 00:16:53.651\nit's getting bigger.\n\n294\n00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:56.210\nI did put a finite limit on that and\n\n295\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.428\nI also restricted it to happen every so\noften, right?\n\n296\n00:17:00.428 --> 00:17:04.253\nIf I move this outside and\njust to show you.\n\n297\n00:17:04.253 --> 00:17:09.591\nIf I didn't put that kind of guard,\nif I move this outside wee.\n\n298\n00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Also there's no limit.\n\n299\n00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:13.608\nI'm not enforcing the high line.\n\n300\n00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:14.906\n&gt;&gt; Then you'd be playing against the wall.\n\n301\n00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:18.234\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're playing tennis against\nthe wall, and well you're never gonna win.\n\n302\n00:17:18.234 --> 00:17:24.187\nSo there's a little bit of things in\nthere and well, if you put back the move.\n\n303\n00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:28.686\nIt's even more subtle, but notice how\nwe've taken that chocolate cake with cream\n\n304\n00:17:28.686 --> 00:17:31.203\ncheese icing, the simple computer pattern.\n\n305\n00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:32.775\nAnd we've put heat bars on top of it.\n\n306\n00:17:32.775 --> 00:17:35.309\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To add our growing computer panel,\n\n307\n00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:35.912\nand now,\n\n308\n00:17:35.912 --> 00:17:41.436\nwe're kind of just layering things that we\nneed while still enforcing the interface.\n\n309\n00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:47.141\nThe updating the render that we\nneed in order to keep things going.\n\n310\n00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:51.050\nNotice I just changed the name\nof the function call.\n\n311\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.104\nThis provides me the ability\nto explore these strategies,\n\n312\n00:17:56.104 --> 00:18:00.056\nbut also change difficulty\nlevels if need be.\n\n313\n00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:03.908\n&gt;&gt; So one final thing,\nthis is in the same file.\n\n314\n00:18:03.908 --> 00:18:06.534\nI'm not a big fan of that, right?\n\n315\n00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:08.223\nLet's do a little bit of reorganization.\n\n316\n00:18:08.223 --> 00:18:10.217\nTry to keep our ad.js small, there you go.\n\n317\n00:18:10.217 --> 00:18:12.591\nAnd I think we'll be good to go.\n\n318\n00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:18.867\nSo new file and\ngrowing computer paddle.js.\n\n319\n00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:24.834\nAnd let's grab this, and there we go.\n\n320\n00:18:24.834 --> 00:18:31.849\nSo cut it out, paste and boom.\n\n321\n00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:38.300\nDon't forget growing computer paddle-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n322\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Growing computer paddle,\nshould be there.\n\n323\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.761\nLet's make sure that it's all good,\nand yeah, it's back to working.\n\n324\n00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:48.987\nIt's all kind of slimmed up and\na little cleaner.\n\n325\n00:18:48.987 --> 00:18:52.538\nStill not quite as clean as\nI would like for it to be,\n\n326\n00:18:52.538 --> 00:18:56.518\nbut maybe our refactoring of\nthe game per se is coming up.\n\n327\n00:18:56.518 --> 00:18:59.663\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did have another question for\nyou, just kinda backing up a little bit.\n\n328\n00:18:59.663 --> 00:19:01.036\nThe date portions, right?\n\n329\n00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:03.233\nDo we really need those?\n\n330\n00:19:03.233 --> 00:19:04.929\nIs that something we need to have?\n\n331\n00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:07.087\n&gt;&gt; So there's a couple of\ndifferent ways to manage that.\n\n332\n00:19:07.087 --> 00:19:10.552\nI find that dates,\nthis date.now is fairly new.\n\n333\n00:19:10.552 --> 00:19:16.708\nI find that dates are easy ways to\nkeep track of how long it's been.\n\n334\n00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.819\nSo do we need them?\n\n335\n00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:21.800\nNo, there's other ways,\nwe could just start counting, right?\n\n336\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.234\nOnce I count to a thousand,\nnow that's 60 frames per second.\n\n337\n00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:29.919\nLet's see, I bet a thousand would\nbe roughly ten seconds, right?\n\n338\n00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.707\n60 frames.\n\n339\n00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:33.768\nNo, no, no, I lied.\n\n340\n00:19:33.768 --> 00:19:40.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's about ten seconds ish.\n\n341\n00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:43.895\nDates though allow me to go,\nright now, subtract them and\n\n342\n00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:46.265\nthen I'm gonna get milliseconds.\n\n343\n00:19:46.265 --> 00:19:50.386\nDividing this by 1,000,\nwould give it to me in seconds roughly.\n\n344\n00:19:50.386 --> 00:19:56.005\nIt's not exact because the actual\nrendering and painting of the frame,\n\n345\n00:19:56.005 --> 00:20:00.161\nit gets scheduled by\nthe actual scheduling portion.\n\n346\n00:20:00.161 --> 00:20:04.252\nAnd this date.now,\nthat just allows me to do a quick check.\n\n347\n00:20:04.252 --> 00:20:08.487\nAnd make sure that I'm not\nincrementing the height forever, and\n\n348\n00:20:08.487 --> 00:20:11.338\nthat I'm imposing some kind of time limit.\n\n349\n00:20:11.338 --> 00:20:14.745\nSo absolutely necessary to use dates?\n\n350\n00:20:14.745 --> 00:20:18.500\nNo, but I find it to be the easiest.\n\n351\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.036\nBecause lastChange as a date\nminus right now, that'll give\n\n352\n00:20:22.036 --> 00:20:26.697\nme the difference between those times\nin milliseconds, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n353\n00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:29.608\nDivide by 1,000,\nthat'll give me the difference in seconds.\n\n354\n00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:34.541\nAnd then I can take a look,\nwell, has it been three seconds?\n\n355\n00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:39.390\nAnd it allows me to reason about in\nregular time instead of in computer time.\n\n356\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.080\nSo what I mean is if it's 60 frames per\nsecond and you've counted 60 times,\n\n357\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.320\nyou have to do a bunch of math to go,\nokay, it's counted 60 in computer time.\n\n358\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.758\nThat's been a computer second, and\nwhat I mean by computer time is,\n\n359\n00:20:50.758 --> 00:20:53.506\nif something causes performance\nto drop frame rates.\n\n360\n00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:57.324\nThen how long the time has passed\nis dependent on frame rates.\n\n361\n00:20:57.324 --> 00:21:01.860\nI want it to be more dependent\non my observational time space.\n\n362\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.720\nInstead of [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That makes more sense too.\n\n363\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n364\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.274\nSo this been creating the computer player\npanel part two and there is a part one.\n\n365\n00:21:09.274 --> 00:21:10.838\nWatch them both, it's very important.\n\n366\n00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.230\nJustin, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n367\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.491\n&gt;&gt; Well I think it's time to start doing\na little bit of clean up in app.js and\n\n368\n00:21:16.491 --> 00:21:20.426\nmaybe even some of our index.html\nto make it a little more dynamic.\n\n369\n00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:23.862\nWe've started down that pathway by\npassing the Canvas object to our\n\n370\n00:21:23.862 --> 00:21:27.004\nrespective objects,\nI think we're going to need to do that.\n\n371\n00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:30.504\nThat's gonna take probably a little big\nof work, a little big of thought process,\n\n372\n00:21:30.504 --> 00:21:32.312\nchasing some bugs, but it's necessary.\n\n373\n00:21:32.312 --> 00:21:35.245\nIt's probably gonna make some\nadditional features a little easier.\n\n374\n00:21:35.245 --> 00:21:37.410\nSo probably a good time to start that.\n\n375\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.873\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou're doing an awesome job, Justin.\n\n376\n00:21:38.873 --> 00:21:40.690\nYou always do.\nHTML5 Canvas projects,\n\n377\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.067\nyou wanna see all the episodes,\nyou'll be glad you did there.\n\n378\n00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:47.825\nAnd check out the course library, all\nthe hundreds and thousands of courses and\n\n379\n00:21:47.825 --> 00:21:48.902\nvideos we have there.\n\n380\n00:21:48.902 --> 00:21:53.534\nAll designed to help you go further,\nand tell everybody about DevPro.TV.\n\n381\n00:21:53.534 --> 00:21:54.528\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n382\n00:21:54.528 --> 00:21:55.046\nThanks for watching.\n\n383\n00:21:55.046 --> 00:21:56.151\nI'm Zach Memis.\n\n384\n00:21:56.151 --> 00:21:56.790\n&gt;&gt;

Well I am here to tell you.\n\n10\n00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:38.130\nRefactoring into a game, you're like\nJustin, you just made all those words up.\n\n11\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Bunch of words just floating around.\n\n12\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Possibly.\n\n13\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.310\nPossibly.\nI could have done it just to troll Zack.\n\n14\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.040\nRight?\n\n15\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040\nZack, I'm gonna give you this title\nthat doesn't actually mean anything.\n\n16\n00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.830\nAnd I want you to memorize and say it.\n\n17\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.240\nSo a common practice is,\nis we kind of make these things, right,\n\n18\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.100\nwe get things working.\n\n19\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420\nAnd we go, that's kind of messy, and\nI don't like how this is done and\n\n20\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.208\nthen we need to come back and\nmake it better, right?\n\n21\n00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:04.110\nWe're gonna re-factor our code\nto accomplish the same end goal,\n\n22\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.080\nbut being a little more structured, a\nlittle more extensible if that's our goal.\n\n23\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.120\nMaybe we factor for performance.\n\n24\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.450\nWell, I got it working but\nwow, this is real slow.\n\n25\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.780\nHow can I change that?\n\n26\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300\nSo there's a lot of reasons.\n\n27\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.720\nFor me, its about code organization and\njust kind of the thought process.\n\n28\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.812\nBecause all of this is kind of\nsquished together, tightly coupled.\n\n29\n00:01:25.812 --> 00:01:28.690\nWe have some global variables\nwandering around that\n\n30\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.050\nmaybe you relied on in other places.\n\n31\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.950\nAnd I don't particularly like that.\n\n32\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.560\nI want it to be if I want to\nuse a panel in another game or\n\n33\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.530\nsome other thing, I can just remove that\nfile, move it over, and it still works.\n\n34\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.910\nSo that's my goal in this.\n\n35\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.930\n&gt;&gt; So simply put,\nwhat do you mean by game object?\n\n36\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.048\nOr what are we talking about here?\n\n37\n00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:51.510\n&gt;&gt; Ahh, so as it stands now, our app.js\nis kind of behaving like our game object.\n\n38\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.920\nBut our canvas, our context,\n\n39\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.410\nthings of that nature have been kind\nof hoisted into the global scope.\n\n40\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.000\nNow I'm using const, which is block scope,\nbut because they're defined in this file,\n\n41\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.760\nthey kinda bubble up to the window\nobject and it's everywhere.\n\n42\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.410\nI don't want that.\n\n43\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.870\nIn addition to the canvas is\nthe defining element on the page.\n\n44\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.700\nI would rather like to be able to create a\ngame object that holds all internal state,\n\n45\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.130\nmanages objects, and\nonly exposes the methods we need.\n\n46\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.129\nBecause since these are all kinda global\nscope things, someone could overwrite.\n\n47\n00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.418\nLike what is the canvas, and\nstart breaking things, and\n\n48\n00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:32.200\nI could even do that on accident.\n\n49\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.450\nMoreover, how do you want to use it?\n\n50\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.723\nWell, I need to request animation frame\non main, on the main function on app.js.\n\n51\n00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.452\nNow really I would like to\nhave like a game dot main or\n\n52\n00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:47.000\na game dot run and\nthen that kicks off everything.\n\n53\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.053\nIn addition to any configuration that I\nneed to do is like all kind of mangled up,\n\n54\n00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:55.182\nand people would change that, and that\nmay be fun but it's not something I want.\n\n55\n00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:59.555\nWhat I would really want is I\nconstruct a game in particular,\n\n56\n00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.584\nI'm going to call it game to\nkeep it fairly general, but\n\n57\n00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:07.813\nwe could call it Homage or\nPing Pong or something, right?\n\n58\n00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:13.773\nBut I'm going to create that game and\nits going to give a selector ultimately,\n\n59\n00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:18.671\nand its going to give the options\nin order to construct the game.\n\n60\n00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.890\nAnd that way it's a little more general,\nit's a little more movable about.\n\n61\n00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.080\nI'll make this game that's nice to play.\n\n62\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.864\nBut what if I wanted to shrink it down,\nmake it small, and\n\n63\n00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.920\nput it part of a gallery, right?\n\n64\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.830\nWell then,\nI could still use the same files to\n\n65\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.315\ncreate that small gallery version of the\ngame instead of this large screen version.\n\n66\n00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:38.995\n&gt;&gt; Does that mean we have\nto change a lot of stuff?\n\n67\n00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:41.455\nI mean, what is the scope of work here,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n68\n00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.975\n&gt;&gt; So, here's what we're gonna do.\n\n69\n00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:46.685\nOur initial stage is going to be,\nlet's just get it into an object.\n\n70\n00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.445\nAnd because of the way\nwe've written the app.js,\n\n71\n00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:54.225\nI'm gonna use a pattern that essentially\ncreates a function that returns an object.\n\n72\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170\nAnd then does all of the work inside.\n\n73\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.155\nSo now my canvas is gonna be\nscoped to the game object.\n\n74\n00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:03.680\nFunction scope instead of\n[INAUDIBLE] To the window.\n\n75\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.340\nAfter we do that, we're half, not only\nare we refactoring it as a game object,\n\n76\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.350\nwhat you'll find is associated\nthings may also need to change.\n\n77\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.910\nWe started down a path of the paddles,\nof passing in the canvas so\n\n78\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.880\nthey're a little more dynamic in their\nplacement and possibly even their size.\n\n79\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.760\nSo I think we want to instill that,\nin addition to it would be nice if\n\n80\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.625\nthe ball knew about the canvas because\nthat determines the boundaries.\n\n81\n00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:27.445\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n82\n00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:32.770\nif if the ball is made aware of\nthe canvas, well then it could self check.\n\n83\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.690\nAm I out of bounds, right?\n\n84\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.935\nWhen we're building these objects, it's\nnice to think of them anthropomorphically.\n\n85\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.670\nThink of you.\n\n86\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.090\nIf you were a ball on a tennis court, and\n\n87\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.560\nyou ran out of bounds, well yeah someone\nelse could call you out of bounds, but\n\n88\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.120\nyou yourself could also\ninform that individual.\n\n89\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.770\nHey, they would ask you.\n\n90\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.680\nHey, are you out of bounds?\n\n91\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.030\nAnd you'd look down and\ngo yeah I'm out of bounds.\n\n92\n00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.691\nSo I think it's easier to think\nabout this communication,\n\n93\n00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.672\nkind of this message passing which in an\nOOP context that's [CROSSTALK], yeah two\n\n94\n00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:10.726\nway communication instead of having all\nof the logic built into the game, right,\n\n95\n00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:15.268\nthis game object What I want to do is\nfurther explore making the individual\n\n96\n00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:20.029\nobjects aware of the constraints that\nthey need to follow, so they can answer\n\n97\n00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.394\nquestions or various other actions\nthat are asked of them by the game.\n\n98\n00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:28.646\nSo the game would be the moderator, and\nthen the objects conform to the rules of\n\n99\n00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:32.075\nthe game because of the constraints\nplaced on them by the game.\n\n100\n00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:35.640\nBut for instance Hey, ball,\nare you out of the top or bottom?\n\n101\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.540\nAnd it would go, no.\n\n102\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.020\nAnd then, if it is, the game's gonna say,\nlet's say it hits the top.\n\n103\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.640\nThe game's gonna go,\nwell I need you to turn around, right?\n\n104\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n105\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.590\nby changing how that works it's\ngonna become more readable, and\n\n106\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.990\na little easier to reason about\nwhat is my game logic versus\n\n107\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.850\nwhat is the internal state of my object?\n\n108\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.160\nThat's my personal opinion.\n\n109\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.206\nThat's how I view.\n\n110\n00:05:57.206 --> 00:05:58.838\nSo we're going to go down that path.\n\n111\n00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:00.006\nAnd then finally,\n\n112\n00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:04.824\nwe're going to add that little bit of\ndynamicism that I was talking about about\n\n113\n00:06:04.824 --> 00:06:08.560\nbeing able to only point to\na selector of an element on a page.\n\n114\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.989\nAnd then dynamically create the canvas,\ndynamically create how big the canvas is.\n\n115\n00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:17.872\nDynamically create how big the paddles and\nthe objects and placement are, so make it\n\n116\n00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:23.300\na little more dynamic so it's not as\nconstrained to this very particular case.\n\n117\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.750\nWith that said, that would allow us to\nget a little more, get a little closer to\n\n118\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.310\nactually being able to resize the canvas\nand have it respond appropriately.\n\n119\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.850\nSo, those are our three stages.\n\n120\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.280\nOur first one, fairly simple and I think,\nthat's probably good, a good point\n\n121\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.420\nto move toward and get finished before\nwe worry about any of the other stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.790\n&gt;&gt; It's just cool to having\na self-aware ping pong ball.\n\n123\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.670\nI mean, that's cool.\n\n124\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.250\n&gt;&gt; When I say self-aware,\nyou're gonna ask me questions, and\n\n125\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.490\nit's gonna respond appropriately.\n\n126\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.472\n&gt;&gt; No, I know.\n&gt;&gt; If your ping pong\n\n127\n00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:56.364\nball starts moving around your room\nwithout you doing anything, then\n\n128\n00:06:56.364 --> 00:06:58.513\n&gt;&gt; So you should probably leave or\n\n129\n00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:03.675\nat least ask it what the lottery\nnumbers are or something, I don't know.\n\n130\n00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:06.007\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But now that I've kind of outlaid our\n\n131\n00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:09.766\ngoal, let's go ahead and\ndo that first set of things, right?\n\n132\n00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:13.241\nLet's put our game object, get things\nmoved out of app.js, pare down app,js, and\n\n133\n00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:14.407\njust get it worked, right?\n\n134\n00:07:14.407 --> 00:07:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Make it lean.\n\n135\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.340\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and do that.\n\n136\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.690\nLet's come into my screen here and\nI got a bunch of stuff open.\n\n137\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.720\nI'm actually gonna close\nall of that stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.270\nBecause all we need is index.html.\n\n139\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.858\nCuz we'll have to add that, right?\n\n140\n00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:36.340\nWe need app.js, because that's\nwhere everything is right now.\n\n141\n00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.140\nAnd then we need to create the game.js,\nwhich is, which is gonna be our object.\n\n142\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.690\nIt's gonna be a function that returns\nan object that does stuff, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.995\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate that game object.\n\n144\n00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:53.110\nNot games, game.js.\n\n145\n00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.040\nNow, I'm just using game\nin a general sense.\n\n146\n00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.720\nI could say ping-pong or Or table tennis,\nor something like that, right?\n\n147\n00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.010\nBut, I'm just going to leave it as game,\n\n148\n00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.810\nbecause this could be applied to other\nscenarios other than this particular one.\n\n149\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.560\nAnd, I'm gonna says game equals, and I'm\njust gonna be here, the [INAUDIBLE] arrow\n\n150\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.130\nfunction is going to be very similar\nto what we have been doing before, and,\n\n151\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.130\nI'm going to have it return an object.\n\n152\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.440\nOkay, now I like to have functions that\nreturn things that I can interact with And\n\n153\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.753\nthis going to be necessary in order to\ninteract with the game inside of app.js.\n\n154\n00:08:24.753 --> 00:08:27.733\nSo app.js is kind of like our entry point,\nbut what is it going to do?\n\n155\n00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:29.945\nIts going to construct a game and\nactually get it running.\n\n156\n00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n157\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Which is what it does now but there's\na lot of other stuff going on that is\n\n158\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.600\njust not creating the game, and setting\nit up and getting it started, right?\n\n159\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Why do we need a return of object?\n\n160\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.362\nWhy don't we just keep it where it is?\n\n161\n00:08:42.362 --> 00:08:42.979\nI mean\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n162\n00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:47.121\nultimately what we're gonna do inside of\nthis object is we're only going to expose\n\n163\n00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.869\nthe parts that we want\npeople to interact with.\n\n164\n00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:50.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n165\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.410\n&gt;&gt; So you'll see here shortly,\nI'll have a bunch of characteristics and\n\n166\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.470\nthings in here.\n\n167\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.550\nThat this is how I emulate privacy,\nlike private variable types.\n\n168\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n169\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.210\n&gt;&gt; Inside of JavaScript.\n\n170\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.390\nI don't have a private modifier\nlike some other languages have.\n\n171\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.830\nBut using, if I'm not mistaken,\nit has left me.\n\n172\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.300\nI think this was called\nthe revealing module pattern.\n\n173\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.930\nI'm exporting a module\nfrom a function call.\n\n174\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.560\nRight?\n\n175\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.910\nAnd then what that does is it keeps\nall the internal state secret and\n\n176\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.940\nit can only be modified through\nthe public API, which is the object.\n\n177\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.230\nSo what do I mean by public API?\n\n178\n00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.050\nWhatever the game object's\nactually gonna show.\n\n179\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n180\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.410\n&gt;&gt; So that's all you have that returned.\n\n181\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.900\nAnd also having functions that\nreturn stuff actually in general,\n\n182\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.180\nhelps reason about them.\n\n183\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.630\nThere's kinda like, console.log,\n\n184\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.030\nit just prints stuff to the console so\nthat's an exception to the rule.\n\n185\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.890\nSo, here's our app.js.\n\n186\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.450\nAnd you know what I'm\nthinking I'm gonna do?\n\n187\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.662\nI think I'm just gonna do this.\n\n188\n00:09:53.662 --> 00:09:57.730\nI think I'm just gonna cut all that out-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.180\n&gt;&gt; And move it over to the game.\n\n190\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.430\nOkay.\n\n191\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.596\nNow, with that said, I still\n\n192\n00:10:05.596 --> 00:10:11.630\nhave these fat arrow functions,\nI still have some of this stuff.\n\n193\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.550\nI probably don't want to\nstart the game immediately,\n\n194\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.857\nso I'm going to remove that\nrequest animation, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.730\nBut what this means is I'm gonna get\nan object that I'm not using the this\n\n196\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.480\ncontext with.\n\n197\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.790\nAnd that's perfectly\nokay using this pattern.\n\n198\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.210\nBecause effectively what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna have Canvas.\n\n199\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:35.190\nBut Canvas is not gonna be available\neverywhere, only inside the game, right?\n\n200\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.530\nIt's kinda like if you were\nplaying a physical game.\n\n201\n00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.770\nPeople don't expect you to take the coins,\n\n202\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.680\nI'm talking old school arcade type stuff,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.780\nYou can't tilt the pinball machine, right?\n\n204\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.170\nYou can't cheat the system,\n\n205\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.850\nyou can't get to the internals of\nthe game, that's what I'm doing.\n\n206\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:55.716\nI'm putting these internally and only\nallowing you to hit the flipper switches,\n\n207\n00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:58.532\nor pull back the ball launcher, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:01.325\nSo I'm only exposing the parts that\nI want you to interact with, and\n\n209\n00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:04.110\nthat's because I'm a little\nbit of a control freak.\n\n210\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.500\nIn addition to, we're gonna do\na little bit of renaming here,\n\n211\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.440\nbut let's try to get this working.\n\n212\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.900\nAnd now here's the return\nthat I was talking about.\n\n213\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.250\nRight now, let's just do main main, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.470\nAnd I will eventually change\nthis to use some newer syntax.\n\n215\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.320\nWhat this is going to do is as long\nas this main is defined prior to,\n\n216\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.280\nit's going to construct an object\nthat has a main function, and\n\n217\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.205\nexposes that as the only method.\n\n218\n00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:36.900\nThat's all you can do.\n\n219\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.700\nYou can't touch the computer,\nthe ball, or anything.\n\n220\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.632\nAnd now it's all hidden away.\n\n221\n00:11:44.632 --> 00:11:49.050\nLet's go ahead and\nput that on our index.html, and boom.\n\n222\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.633\nLet's make this game.js.\n\n223\n00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:55.050\nNow again that's command shift d on Mac,\ncontrol shift d on Windows.\n\n224\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.410\nIn Linux and Atom, your mileage may vary\n\n225\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.270\ndepending on whether you've changed the\nkey mappings and things of that nature.\n\n226\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.560\nSo there's our game, and\nif we come back, it's all broke.\n\n227\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.040\nWell, that's because we haven't actually\nconstructed the game yet, nothing.\n\n228\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.111\nSo what do I want?\n\n229\n00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.597\nI want homage.\n\n230\n00:12:14.597 --> 00:12:16.290\nIs that how you spell homage?\n\n231\n00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.523\n&gt;&gt; Homage.\nH-O-M-A-G-E?\n\n232\n00:12:17.523 --> 00:12:18.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nI think it is.\n\n233\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n234\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:26.328\n&gt;&gt; So and then I'm gonna say Game and\nthen homage.main like so.\n\n235\n00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:30.270\nNow really, I should use\nrequestAnimationFrame to kick this off.\n\n236\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.140\nBut just to show you that\nthis should still work,\n\n237\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.750\nassuming we don't have to\ntrack down any shenanigans.\n\n238\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.970\n&gt;&gt; I love shenanigans.\n\n239\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.230\n&gt;&gt; Boom, our game is back.\n\n240\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.621\nHey, but now, do we have the canvas?\n\n241\n00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.075\nNo, canvas is, people can't\nmess with this in the console.\n\n242\n00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:45.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n243\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.550\n&gt;&gt; What about the paddle, right?\n\n244\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.590\nOr the player,\ncuz the people can mess with the player.\n\n245\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.810\nWell, they can just give themselves\nthe high score and then win, right?\n\n246\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.420\n&gt;&gt; That's no fun.\n&gt;&gt; That's no fun.\n\n247\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.490\nBut, if I look at game,\nI didn't call it game.\n\n248\n00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.850\nHomage, I have a function.\n\n249\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.190\nRight here.\n\n250\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.320\nAnd all it exposes is this main function\nthat actually starts our animation\n\n251\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.610\nloop and maintains everything.\n\n252\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.950\nAll of my other variables, all of my other\nstate, all of my other logic is private.\n\n253\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.180\nNo one can touch it.\n\n254\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.720\nI have,\nkind of deep looted the global name space,\n\n255\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.100\nI've put this in an object, and\nnow, if I wanted to, right,\n\n256\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.820\nlet's say that game had an argument here,\nthat said difficulty.\n\n257\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.233\nOr it would take a configurations object,\n\n258\n00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:40.580\nthat would say difficulty easy, right?\n\n259\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.680\nAnd then I can make decisions based\non the internal state, right?\n\n260\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.250\nWell if you want easy, then I'm just going\nto do the simple computer panel which just\n\n261\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.215\nmoves up and down.\n\n262\n00:13:48.215 --> 00:13:48.753\nYou want medium?\n\n263\n00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:50.420\nWell, I'm going to do the growing one.\n\n264\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.660\nYou want hard?\n\n265\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.135\nI'm gonna build another one,\n\n266\n00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:56.711\nand now all that configuration can be\nyour configuration object, [SOUND],\n\n267\n00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.278\nand when you want to start the game,\nthere's a main.\n\n268\n00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:05.136\nLikewise, it would be nice if\nwe could put something like,\n\n269\n00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:12.970\nselector right here and then construct\nit based on where you wanna put it.\n\n270\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.660\nBut, as you can see the actual refactor\nwasn't too bad just to get things working.\n\n271\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.522\nWe're not quite finished.\n\n272\n00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:24.787\nThe one thing that I wanna show you is,\nnow that main's exposed, that's all\n\n273\n00:14:24.787 --> 00:14:29.200\npeople can touch, but right here, this\nhas been bothering me for a little bit.\n\n274\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.965\nSee this ctx save, fillStyle,\nfillRect, restore?\n\n275\n00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n276\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.241\n&gt;&gt; Well what does it,\n\n277\n00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.180\nthat doesn't actually tell me anything\nabout what it does in a main method.\n\n278\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.950\nAnd I'm like, what does that do?\n\n279\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.130\nIf I go through it I see that it's\nactually painting over the background,\n\n280\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.255\nwhich gives us the trails and\ndoes the clearing and stuff.\n\n281\n00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n282\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.390\n&gt;&gt; Why couldn't we just put that\nin a paint background method, or\n\n283\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.010\na paint background function, right?\n\n284\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.760\nDo people need to know how\nto paint the background?\n\n285\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.320\nNo, that's internal.\n\n286\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.948\nSo what I'm going to do is grant this and\n\n287\n00:15:02.948 --> 00:15:10.116\ncreate a paintBackground\nfunction that does exactly that.\n\n288\n00:15:13.263 --> 00:15:18.590\nAnd now I can say paintBackground,\nso these internal functions,\n\n289\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.725\nthese internal objects are used\nto build up this main function,\n\n290\n00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:26.880\nthat we could expose as run or whatnot.\n\n291\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.340\nAnd well it should still work,\nassuming that we haven't done anything.\n\n292\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.240\nAnd notice that it does.\n\n293\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.760\nBut when I come in to make\nmodifications if I'm the developer and\n\n294\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.900\nreally people can look at your game and\ngrab it off the internet.\n\n295\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.980\nSo there's nothing truly\nprivate about this,\n\n296\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.440\nit's just I can't programmatically\naccess it as easy.\n\n297\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.160\nWhat does this do?\n\n298\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.680\nWell, it requests the next main to be run,\nand then we wanna paintBackground.\n\n299\n00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:00.370\nAnd if the ball, right, and then bounce,\nand all this state becomes the same.\n\n300\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.118\nBut now what this allows us to do,\n\n301\n00:16:02.118 --> 00:16:07.410\nis this over-all game object has\noverview of all these things.\n\n302\n00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.440\nIt knows about the canvas,\nit knows about the context.\n\n303\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.370\nAnd we can use that to our\nadvantage to now say, well,\n\n304\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.910\nyou know, instead of doing all of this,\nwhat if we change the ball to when\n\n305\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.880\nthe game constructs, it says, hey ball,\nhere's the canvas you're gonna be in.\n\n306\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.320\nAnd now the ball goes, okay,\nI can tell you when I'm out of bounds.\n\n307\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.800\nAnd then you can make decisions, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.150\nLikewise for the computer player or\nfor the regular player because I'll\n\n309\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:42.200\nlet you know when you need to do things so\nthe game is like the omniscient overview,\n\n310\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.440\nand then all these objects are composed\nin that to actually bring you the game.\n\n311\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.380\n&gt;&gt; I see, just a we're building logic.\n\n312\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n313\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.820\nAnd our ultimate goal next is to actually\nmake some of those changes to the paddle\n\n314\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.040\nand the ball to provide more uniformity.\n\n315\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.920\nAll of them know about the canvas and\nmake them a little more dynamic.\n\n316\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.540\nThat way they can place themselves\nin the canvas appropriately,\n\n317\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.670\nas well as be able to answer questions\nlike, are you out to the right,\n\n318\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.280\nare you out to the left,\nare you out to the top, the bottom.\n\n319\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.310\nHave you hit the boundaries, hey.\n\n320\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.230\nAnd now, when we start doing that,\n\n321\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.575\nwe could even go as far as letting\nthe paddles know about the ball, so\n\n322\n00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:26.600\nthey can tell you,\nhey did the ball just hit you?\n\n323\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.830\nAnd if it does,\nthen tell the ball to turn around.\n\n324\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.240\nSo, there's a bunch of\ndifferent ways to do that, but\n\n325\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.450\nI like the game being\nthe overview of logic, and\n\n326\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.745\nthen it's just asking all of the members\nquestions in order to make a decision.\n\n327\n00:17:37.745 --> 00:17:38.485\n&gt;&gt; This is awesome.\n\n328\n00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:40.815\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're working on here.\n\n329\n00:17:40.815 --> 00:17:42.125\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, very cool.\n\n330\n00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:46.185\nSo does, I'm gonna say it right,\nrefactoring into a game object and\n\n331\n00:17:46.185 --> 00:17:48.640\nis there gonna be a part two or\nare we good?\n\n332\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.758\nOr we gonna move on to something else.\n\n333\n00:17:49.758 --> 00:17:52.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely have a long road.\n\n334\n00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:53.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ahead of us,\n\n335\n00:17:53.835 --> 00:17:58.210\nbecause not only are we refactoring\na game object along that brings\n\n336\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.720\nsome other changes that we need to make,\nright?\n\n337\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.042\nI wanna make this dynamic so\nI can mount this anywhere.\n\n338\n00:18:02.042 --> 00:18:04.670\nI want this to be dynamic based on size.\n\n339\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.089\nI also want the objects to\nbe set up to where okay,\n\n340\n00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:10.511\nreally the paddles need to know\nabout the canvas, the ball does, and\n\n341\n00:18:10.511 --> 00:18:14.300\nthe paddles kinda need to know about\nthe balls so they can answer questions.\n\n342\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.200\nOr vice versa, the ball should know about\nthe paddles and be able to say, yeah,\n\n343\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.580\nI just ran into something.\n\n344\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.140\nSo, those are design decisions that I'm\ntrying to be explicit of when I've said,\n\n345\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.860\nthis is how I'm doing it.\n\n346\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.960\nThis is not the only way.\n\n347\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.690\nAnd, for the most part that's the case.\n\n348\n00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.296\nWe're definitely coming\nback with a part two.\n\n349\n00:18:29.296 --> 00:18:30.811\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n&gt;&gt; Might even be a part three,\n\n350\n00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:34.720\ncuz I think it's a good stopping\npoint to get your mind around this.\n\n351\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.240\nAnd then, we're going to come back and\n\n352\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.580\nstart implementing some more of those\nreadability and kind of logic changes.\n\n353\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.690\n&gt;&gt; Refactoring into a game object,\npart two.\n\n354\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.840\nThis has been part one.\n\n355\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.160\nWatch them both, in fact, watch every\nepisode of HTML5 canvas projects.\n\n356\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.140\nYou will be glad you did.\n\n357\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.950\nAnd take a look at the course library and\n\n358\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.970\nall the hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n359\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.000\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevPro TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n360\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.650\nThanks for watching.\n\n361\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:00.440\nI'm Zach Memetz.\n\n362\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.170\n&gt;&gt;

So\n\n19\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.510\nthese are the attributes it\nwill have to have, attributes.\n\n20\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.400\n&gt;&gt; I can say that word, attributes.\n\n21\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.080\nIt is hard, there is a weird b in there.\n\n22\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.950\nBut yeah,\nit needs the ability to keep score,\n\n23\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.640\nit needs the ability to report when\nscores have achieved some kind of goal.\n\n24\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n25\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Render itself, and then there's a few\nother questions you may wanna ask,\n\n26\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.140\nas well as reset, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.830\nSo you can always think of when\nthe game's done we need to reset back.\n\n28\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.810\nNow, I'm actually gonna use\na little bit different pattern.\n\n29\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.530\nIt's more similar to the game object and\ncreating the scoreboard than well,\n\n30\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.990\nthe actual ball and\npaddle and things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.850\nMainly, cuz I don't want\nthe scores kinda exposed.\n\n32\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.170\nRight, I don't want you to be able to say,\nwell you know I was losing real bad,\n\n33\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580\nI hopped over in the console, change the\nscoreboard scores and yay, I'm a winner.\n\n34\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I don't want people to cheat,\n\n35\n00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:46.420\nwell, unless they're really good,\nthen well, more bravo to you, right?\n\n36\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.450\nSo our goal is to build a scoreboard to\nwhere we can utilize it to determine win\n\n37\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.960\nconditions, and that's all going to\nbe encapsulated in the scoreboard.\n\n38\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n39\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.940\n&gt;&gt; So let's actually take a look at my\nscreen, and we've done a little bit of\n\n40\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.720\ncleanup, and let's start building that\nscoreboard, kind of subbing it out.\n\n41\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.116\nAnd this is our game object,\nlet's fold this up and just,\n\n42\n00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.978\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n43\n00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:13.050\nAll right well,\nlet's create our scoreboard file.\n\n44\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.558\nSo over here in our JS folder.\n\n45\n00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:19.920\nNew file, scoreboard.js like so.\n\n46\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.284\nNow the scoreboard,\n\n47\n00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:26.372\nas I said it should probably be be aware\nthe canvas cuz it is gonna render itself.\n\n48\n00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:31.127\nSo I think in general if it has\na render function it may want to be\n\n49\n00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:32.780\naware of the canvas.\n\n50\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.210\nNow in all, you know just all of\nkind of being upfront about it,\n\n51\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.720\nif you have the context you can actually\nlook up the canvas from the context so\n\n52\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.400\nthe render function will\nbe able to do that.\n\n53\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.510\nBut what if we want to initialize\ndata based on the canvas.\n\n54\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.650\nSo I'm gonna pass it in.\n\n55\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.526\nIf we find out that we don't\nactually need it then we can\n\n56\n00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:57.137\njust pull it out and no one's the wiser.\n\n57\n00:02:57.137 --> 00:03:00.780\nNotice these are not surrounded\nby parenthesis, just like so.\n\n58\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.310\nAnd because they're not surrounded by\nparenthesis this is gonna be a standard\n\n59\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.130\nfunction body.\n\n60\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.340\nAnd I'm gonna use this,\nas I said very similar to the game object.\n\n61\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.850\nSo don't be like well this\nis the scoreboard object.\n\n62\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.708\nNo, not quite.\n\n63\n00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:16.640\nSo let's see,\n\n64\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.640\nI need the ability to keep\ntrack of some scores.\n\n65\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.840\nNow the scores,\nthose are probably gonna change, right?\n\n66\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.890\nI may even have to reset them and so\nI'm gonna use this let internal so\n\n67\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.228\nI can mutate the state.\n\n68\n00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:35.640\nBut don't, I'll have to be careful about\nthat, we'll just have to think about that.\n\n69\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.670\nSo let's see, we have a player score and\n\n70\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.370\nby default upon construction\neveryone starts with 0, right?\n\n71\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.800\nOtherwise that would be,\nhow do you say unfair?\n\n72\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.350\nOkay, so there's our scores,\nthat's our data.\n\n73\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.200\nNow what else do we need?\n\n74\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.110\nWell we need a render and\n\n75\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.890\nI'm just kind of stubbing these out,\nnot filling these in quiet yet.\n\n76\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.530\nAnd we need, I think what I'm gonna do is,\n\n77\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.620\nsince I don't want people to\nhave direct access to these,\n\n78\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.020\nI'm just gonna have them have\nthe ability to call hey, someone scored.\n\n79\n00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.532\nAnd then technically they\ncould still get around it, but\n\n80\n00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:17.322\nthey couldn't do crazy stuff, right?\n\n81\n00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:18.151\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:23.268\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of a setter syntax and,\nit still allows\n\n83\n00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:28.616\npeople to cheat if they're\nfairly good at JavaScript,\n\n84\n00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:33.750\nbut I guess there's worse\nthings in the world.\n\n85\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.200\nAnd here we go,\ncomputer scores so likewise,\n\n86\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.080\neither the player scores or\nthe computer scores.\n\n87\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.675\nMoreover, I think I wanna ask\nthe scoreboard, isThereAWinner?\n\n88\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.770\nAnd notice that's formed in the,\nkind of a question type.\n\n89\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.900\nRight, so I'm gonna say,\nhey scoreboard, is there a winner yet?\n\n90\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900\nNo, okay, keep going.\n\n91\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.900\nAnd then likewise, I'm gonna say,\nwell there is a winner, whoIsTheWinner?\n\n92\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.670\nAnd I'm big on readability and\nkinda making sense, so\n\n93\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.390\nI could just do this like,\nwho wins or, but\n\n94\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.210\nif I ask questions it's typically\ngoing to be either a true or\n\n95\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.740\nfalse, or it's gonna return something\nthat gives an answer to the question.\n\n96\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.045\nAnd then likewise, I think I need\nthe ability as we said to reset the score,\n\n97\n00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.380\nokay.\n\n98\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.620\nNow, using the pattern that we have for\nthe game, we wanna return an object.\n\n99\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.260\nBy returning an object, we'll have\naccess to this internal scope, but\n\n100\n00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.730\nthen the object will be there.\n\n101\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.376\nSo let's see here, let's see,\n\n102\n00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:50.780\nplayerScores should be\n\n103\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.450\nexported as playerScores, and\nlet's just see if that comes to fruition.\n\n104\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.400\nSo in order to make this available,\nthe game needs to know\n\n105\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.870\nabout it before the game is constructed,\nso let's create a script tag,\n\n106\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.406\nsrc js scoreboard js.\n\n107\n00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:13.156\nAll right, so\nwithin the game let's create a scoreboard,\n\n108\n00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:17.284\nand this will probably go with ball,\nand computer, and player.\n\n109\n00:06:17.284 --> 00:06:22.450\nAnd I don't want to\nnecessarily reassign these,\n\n110\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.723\nso I'm gonna say scoreboard\n= Scoreboard(canvas); and\n\n111\n00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:32.908\nconsole.log(scoreboard) like so.\n\n112\n00:06:32.908 --> 00:06:35.930\nSo there's the player scores, now\n\n113\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.220\nthis is all I'm going to have access to\nis this single function as it stands now.\n\n114\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.972\nSo everything else is private and\nthat's going to be helpful to\n\n115\n00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:49.825\nme to help moderate kind of\nthe interactions to the scoreboard.\n\n116\n00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:54.970\nSo this scoreboard, well let's fill\nout some of these methods, right?\n\n117\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.880\nLet's do the render first to see if\nwe can actually get on the page.\n\n118\n00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:05.840\nSo we come over to the score board, well\nfirst off we need to export the render and\n\n119\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.150\nreally I can just put render here.\n\n120\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.330\nI'm being very explicit, I'll probably\ncome back and clean this up and\n\n121\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.960\nuse some of those new features where\nif the key and the value are exactly\n\n122\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.680\nthe same, you just list it once and\nJavaScript does it for you.\n\n123\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.020\nSo given a render, let's see,\nwhat do we need to do?\n\n124\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.942\nWell, we're gonna keep this fairly simple.\n\n125\n00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:32.590\nSo displayedText and\nI'm gonna use back ticks.\n\n126\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:38.240\nAnd these back ticks are going to give\nme some interesting portions here.\n\n127\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.300\nSo for the player,\n\n128\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.469\nI want to show scores.player.\n\n129\n00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.537\nWhat is the player's score?\n\n130\n00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:56.063\nAnd then for the computer,\nI want to show scores.computer.\n\n131\n00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:57.027\nJust like that.\n\n132\n00:07:57.027 --> 00:08:01.145\nSo that's our kind of display text, and\nI'm tippling into that because well,\n\n133\n00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:03.940\nevery time it may change\nthat it needs to re-render.\n\n134\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.313\nNow, that's not always the case,\nbut it may change, so\n\n135\n00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:10.775\nI'm gonna put this as I need\nto figure this out every time.\n\n136\n00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:17.300\nAnd then I'm going to say ctx.save,\nctx.restore just like that.\n\n137\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:23.192\nAnd then ctx.font = and my favorite font,\n\n138\n00:08:23.192 --> 00:08:27.179\n'40px, Comic Sans MS'.\n\n139\n00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:31.701\nThis is not good for professionalism,\nbut I think it's funny, so\n\n140\n00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:33.655\nI'm going to use it anyway.\n\n141\n00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:35.390\n&gt;&gt; It's good enough for me.\n\n142\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.822\n&gt;&gt; Ctx.fillText(displayedText, 30,\n\n143\n00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:44.496\n30) and\nthe reason being is we put it at 0,\n\n144\n00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:48.691\n0 depending on how the text is aligned.\n\n145\n00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:53.580\nIt may actually put it off the score\nboard, so we'll see there.\n\n146\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.080\nNow, that we have that,\n\n147\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.390\nwe have it in the game, except\nthe game's never going to render it,\n\n148\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.520\nbecause in main, let's actually clean this\nlittle bit up here, let's get rid of that,\n\n149\n00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.540\nwe render the ball to player and computer,\nbut we don't render the scoreboard.\n\n150\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:18.020\nWell, let's say, scoreboard.render and\npass in the context, and there we go.\n\n151\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.480\nSo there we go, c lear our computer and we\nneed to pull that down just a little bit.\n\n152\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.510\nSo that's where our tweaking comes in\nlet's make this about 40, and refresh and\n\n153\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.392\nthere we go, we now actually,\nhave a score board.\n\n154\n00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:36.558\nIt's not doing anything,\nbut it's there, so\n\n155\n00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:41.259\nwe've rendered that out,\nbeautiful, wonderful.\n\n156\n00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:45.470\nSo let's think about these other methods.\n\n157\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.330\nPlayer scores,\nwhat should a player score be?\n\n158\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:55.316\nWell, I'm gonna say scores.player += 1.\n\n159\n00:09:55.316 --> 00:10:00.170\nComputer scores, scores.computer +=\n\n160\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.060\n1 and is there a winner?\n\n161\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.310\nWell, there's only a winner, let's see.\n\n162\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.553\nZach, do you have an idea and\n\n163\n00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:15.803\nlike how do you determine if someone\nwins at a game most of the time?\n\n164\n00:10:15.803 --> 00:10:18.002\nWhat are some ways that you win at a game?\n\n165\n00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:21.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm the guy who goes to get\nthe cheeseburgers when we're all done.\n\n166\n00:10:22.776 --> 00:10:25.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's say that you're playing,\n\n167\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.560\nI dunno, rummy, right?\n\n168\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is a card game and\n\n169\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.850\ntypically you play to 500, right?\n\n170\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.180\nSo whoever wins-\n&gt;&gt; Highest points.\n\n171\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Whoever gets 500 first,\nyou're the winner.\n\n172\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.964\n&gt;&gt; Highest points.\n\n173\n00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you play tennis,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n174\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.392\n&gt;&gt; It's whoever gets to\na certain score first, right?\n\n175\n00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n176\n00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.284\n&gt;&gt; If you play, what are some\nother games that are score-based?\n\n177\n00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:48.245\n&gt;&gt; Ping pong.\n\n178\n00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:49.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ping pong, well,\n\n179\n00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:52.148\nit's whoever gets the highest score first,\nright?\n\n180\n00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:56.719\nAnd to some extent golf, right, but it's\nwhoever has the lowest score at the end,\n\n181\n00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:58.640\nand-\n&gt;&gt; And that's a little bit different.\n\n182\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.400\n&gt;&gt; So some of these games have kind of\na whoever has the highest or lowest.\n\n183\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.235\nBut then some of them, whoever gets to a\ncertain limit first, a goal, so to speak.\n\n184\n00:11:06.235 --> 00:11:07.083\n&gt;&gt; A level, right.\n\n185\n00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:11.973\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I think,\nsince our game is table tennis,\n\n186\n00:11:11.973 --> 00:11:16.430\nwe should probably have a goal in mind,\nright?\n\n187\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.456\nSo let's come back up here to the top,\n&gt;&gt; And add in our goal, so\n\n188\n00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:26.053\nhere's our goal, and\nlet's just say whoever gets to five first.\n\n189\n00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So boom, our goal is five.\n\n190\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.630\nSo if we ask, is there a winner?\n\n191\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:39.264\nWell, return scores.player = goal or\n\n192\n00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:46.100\nscores.computer = goal, so to speak.\n\n193\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.868\nAnd now, we can answer the question,\nwho is the winner?\n\n194\n00:11:52.868 --> 00:11:54.670\nOkay.\nWell, first one to five.\n\n195\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.620\nWho is the winner?\n\n196\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.119\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, well, we want\n\n197\n00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:08.667\nto return scores.player = goal,\n\n198\n00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:15.446\nthen Player, otherwise Computer.\n\n199\n00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:20.760\nOkay, now we may come back and\nuse that, but it's always good to know.\n\n200\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.120\nNow, there is kind of a subtlety here,\nright.\n\n201\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.360\nIf you're gonna ask who is the winner,\nThen the way\n\n202\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.896\nwe have this written, if the player has\nnot won when this method is called,\n\n203\n00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:36.350\nthen the computer automatically wins.\n\n204\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.437\nSo this should really be guarded\nby is there a winner, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:46.748\nSo if there is not a winner,\n\n206\n00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:50.684\nif not there is a winner,\n\n207\n00:12:50.684 --> 00:12:56.880\nthen I just want to return, no one yet.\n\n208\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.020\nAnd really we're gonna be using\nthose a couple of times, but\n\n209\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.850\nif there's not a winner,\nthen just return no one.\n\n210\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.302\nSo don't have a default, and\nthat's just to guard against, well,\n\n211\n00:13:08.302 --> 00:13:12.109\nsince the player hasn't won, then\nthe computer automatically does will know.\n\n212\n00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:13.974\nThey both have one point.\n\n213\n00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:17.560\nYou can't have one winning before\nthe other just by default.\n\n214\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.620\nAnd then likewise, what about reset?\n\n215\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:26.060\nWell, I'm thinking reset should just reset\nthe scores to what they were before.\n\n216\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:34.430\nSo here we go, player 0 and\ncomputer 0, like so.\n\n217\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.636\nSo that's going to reset that variable,\nright up here, back to 0, 0.\n\n218\n00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:41.760\nAnd that's how we are going to\nrestart the game, so to speak.\n\n219\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.870\n&gt;&gt; So the scoreboard will\nbe what decides all that?\n\n220\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.960\n&gt;&gt; It will decide all of that and\nall the game's going to do,\n\n221\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.230\nthe game object is ask\nthe scoreboard questions.\n\n222\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.030\nHey, is there a winner?\n\n223\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.640\nNo?\nOkay, we'll keep going.\n\n224\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.270\nHey, is there a winner?\n\n225\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.754\nThere is, then who is the winner?\n\n226\n00:13:55.754 --> 00:13:56.380\nRight?\n\n227\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.761\nSo think of it as messages\nbetween these respective object.\n\n228\n00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:04.980\nSo there's our scoreboard,\nand let's think about this.\n\n229\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.560\nSo do we need the ability to score for\na player?\n\n230\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.550\nYeah, yeah, we do.\n\n231\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.930\nSo do we need the ability for\nthe computer to score?\n\n232\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:19.016\nYeah, do we need the ability to reset?\n\n233\n00:14:19.016 --> 00:14:22.530\nYeah, right if we're\ngonna play another game.\n\n234\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.162\nShould we be able to\nknow who the winner is?\n\n235\n00:14:25.162 --> 00:14:31.910\nYeah, whoIsTheWinner, boom, and\nthen well, is there a winner?\n\n236\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:39.830\nAnd we need to know isThereAWinner and\nagain, there is some new ES6 features that\n\n237\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.270\nwould keep this repetition down and I'll\nprobably come back and pull those out.\n\n238\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.900\nBut just being very explicit,\nwe have a Render,\n\n239\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.980\nwe have all of the mutations, and\nthe questions that we could ask.\n\n240\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.000\nAnd there is our object, and\nwe go back and print this out.\n\n241\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:02.436\nWell, let's see here,\nconsole.log [scoreboard],\n\n242\n00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:05.994\nsave and refresh, and there we go.\n\n243\n00:15:05.994 --> 00:15:11.521\nSo if we say, Well, we don't have access\nto the scoreboard cuz it's not exposed,\n\n244\n00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:14.959\nbut we have computer scores, is there\na winner, player scores, render, reset,\n\n245\n00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.220\nwhose the winner?\n\n246\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Just then I was looking at,\nyou never returned the actual scores, so\n\n247\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.715\nwhy is that?\n\n248\n00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:23.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what I want,\nis I want that to be hidden away.\n\n249\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.600\nI only want people for people to interact\nthrough the API that I've defined.\n\n250\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.540\nYou can score as a player or\nscore as a computer,\n\n251\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.890\nI don't want them to modify this,\nso I haven't returned those.\n\n252\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:37.080\nBut that is a good catch, and this is\na way of privatizing some of that data and\n\n253\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.480\nso, I just left that out so to speak.\n\n254\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.870\nSo let's actually come back and\n\n255\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.880\nsee if we can actually use some of\nthose methods to modify the scores.\n\n256\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.096\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so, scoreboard.computerscores,\n\n257\n00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:54.887\nright, if we look that's a 0,\nwe refresh notice that becomes a 1.\n\n258\n00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.321\nSo our scoring does actually work And\n\n259\n00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:04.005\nif I were to do that five times,\nwell, that would go to five.\n\n260\n00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.835\nAnd likewise, I would say, whoIsTheWinner.\n\n261\n00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:12.504\nAnd now I know there is a winner in\nthis case, because it's to five.\n\n262\n00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:17.549\nAnd whoIsTheWinner, and I refresh,\nand it says the computer.\n\n263\n00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:20.553\nSo we kinda have the dynamics\nset up in order for\n\n264\n00:16:20.553 --> 00:16:24.960\nthe scoreboard to answer the questions\nthat we're interested in.\n\n265\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.479\nSo if we come back here, and\nnow we come back to this condition,\n\n266\n00:16:31.479 --> 00:16:35.668\nnow it gets a little a more interesting.\n\n267\n00:16:35.668 --> 00:16:40.260\nSo if the ball hits left, or\nhits right, we always want to do this.\n\n268\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:47.770\nHowever, however, if it hits the left,\nthe computer scores, if it hits the right,\n\n269\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.120\nthen the player scores, so\nwe have to add some additional logic here.\n\n270\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.570\nSo if the ball hit the left,\nthen do something,\n\n271\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:05.810\nif the ball hit the right, then do\nsomething else, and what are those things?\n\n272\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.810\nWell, it hits the left side of the screen,\nthen the opposite person, or\n\n273\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.930\nthe opposite player, scores, so\nscoreboard, and the computer scores.\n\n274\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:21.430\nWhat about scoreboard and the player\nscores for the opposite one, right?\n\n275\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.845\nSo if we come back and we refresh, well,\n\n276\n00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:28.549\nwe're never gonna score cuz we have no\nleft and right, so what are we gonna do?\n\n277\n00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:32.709\nWell, let's go back and\nchange this paddle to actually have,\n\n278\n00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:35.620\nnot paddle,\nthe ball to actually have a dx.\n\n279\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.870\nSo here what we're gonna see is\nthe player is going to score,\n\n280\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.672\nscore, score, score, score.\n\n281\n00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:45.109\nScore, score, score, score,\nand it's gonna score forever.\n\n282\n00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:47.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nthat's an easy way to play it.\n\n283\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the game is\nnever actually asking hey,\n\n284\n00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:52.714\nis there a winner yet?\n\n285\n00:17:52.714 --> 00:18:00.170\nIf there is, then do something, right, but\nwe do know that our scoring logic works.\n\n286\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.375\nAnd so if it hits left,\nif it hits right do those things,\n\n287\n00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:08.054\nthat's good, however,\nwhen should we check?\n\n288\n00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:12.642\nI'm thinking right here, right at the top,\n\n289\n00:18:12.642 --> 00:18:18.095\nif(scoreboard.) we go,\nhey, isThereaWinner?\n\n290\n00:18:21.262 --> 00:18:25.677\nLike so, if this is true, if this is true,\n\n291\n00:18:25.677 --> 00:18:30.463\nthen we should probably go ahead and\nsomehow,\n\n292\n00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:34.925\nwe're just gonna dummy it for now.\n\n293\n00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:39.302\nWe'll just say console.log,\nand we'll say winner.\n\n294\n00:18:39.302 --> 00:18:45.770\nAnd we're doing a little bit\nof a guard here based on this.\n\n295\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.723\nwhoIsTheWinner.\n\n296\n00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:54.659\nAnd I'm gonna say\n\n297\n00:18:54.659 --> 00:19:02.150\n'$(winner) wins!').\n\n298\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:09.420\nLikewise, we should say, scoreboard.reset\nin order to reset the scoreboard, right?\n\n299\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.590\nAnd now we have to duplicate this, so\nI'm just going to copy and paste this for\n\n300\n00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.510\nnow, we'll do some\nadditional cleanup later.\n\n301\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:25.043\nAnd then boom, there we go,\nso if i refresh, boom, boom,\n\n302\n00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:30.377\nboom, boom, player wins,\nboom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n303\n00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:35.948\nSo now we have the logic that we\nneed in order to determine winning,\n\n304\n00:19:35.948 --> 00:19:39.528\nwho wins, and, well, the only thing is,\n\n305\n00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:43.830\nthis runs all the time,\ncuz it just console.log.\n\n306\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.810\nNow we can do an alert,\nsomething of that nature, but\n\n307\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.138\nit was fairly simple once\nwe built the object, right?\n\n308\n00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:52.730\nWe just asked the object questions,\nand then we told it, hey,\n\n309\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.345\nwhen the ball hits the left,\nhey scoreboard, the computer scored.\n\n310\n00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:59.240\nAnd when the ball hits the right,\nhey the player scored, and then every so\n\n311\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.210\noften, actually every time we iterate,\nwe go, hey,\n\n312\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.650\nis there a winner, if there is, do this.\n\n313\n00:20:08.002 --> 00:20:12.008\nAnd it'll just keep looping over and\nover and over again, and to some extent,\n\n314\n00:20:12.008 --> 00:20:16.090\nwe can use that to accumulate how many\nwins per side, and things of that nature.\n\n315\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.054\nNow, we've only checked the player side,\n\n316\n00:20:18.054 --> 00:20:20.919\nwe should probably check to see\nif the computer can also win, and\n\n317\n00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:24.605\nthat the scoring still works on the left\nside, because we haven't checked that.\n\n318\n00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:25.828\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's only fair [LAUGH].\n\n319\n00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:29.788\n&gt;&gt; So if we come back to the ball,\nlet's just change this to -10 and\n\n320\n00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:31.217\nchange the direction.\n\n321\n00:20:31.217 --> 00:20:35.339\nAnd there's the computer winning, computer\nwinning, computer winning, and boom,\n\n322\n00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:38.420\ncomputer wins, and guess what,\ncomputer wins again.\n\n323\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.144\nSo our scoreboard is actually keeping\nscore, answers the questions that we need\n\n324\n00:20:42.144 --> 00:20:45.774\nto determine winning conditions,\neverything's kind of set up, good to go.\n\n325\n00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:49.809\nThere may be some changes that we\nneed to make as we continue on, but\n\n326\n00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:54.230\nI'm not gonna get crazy with that\ninitially, at this point in time.\n\n327\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.587\n&gt;&gt; So now that that all works,\n\n328\n00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.845\nis there a way we can pass it in as\nan option instead of hard coding?\n\n329\n00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:00.702\n&gt;&gt; So an option for what?\n\n330\n00:21:00.702 --> 00:21:04.003\n&gt;&gt; An option for the actual winner.\n\n331\n00:21:04.003 --> 00:21:06.390\n&gt;&gt; So an option for?\n\n332\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.655\n&gt;&gt; Like a, you win, congratulations.\n\n333\n00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:13.776\n&gt;&gt; So we could do that, but are you\nasking about the win condition inside of\n\n334\n00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:17.330\nthe scoreboard,\nwhich we've kinda hardcoded here?\n\n335\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We coud pass that in as an option,\n\n336\n00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:22.160\nI'll just pick five, so\nif we wanted to, we could say-\n\n337\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.277\n&gt;&gt; If it goes to four, then it resets.\n\n338\n00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:28.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, so zero, one, two, three,\nfour, five, and then boom, it resets.\n\n339\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.295\n&gt;&gt; But\nwhat if we wanted to play a game to ten?\n\n340\n00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:34.170\nWell, instead of having this hardcoded\noption, we should probably say,\n\n341\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.120\nis there options?\n\n342\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.490\nAnd there's an options.goal.\n\n343\n00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.976\nWell if there is, then do what?\n\n344\n00:21:41.976 --> 00:21:48.440\nWell, use options.goal, otherwise just\nuse 5, we'll just do the same fallback.\n\n345\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.060\n&gt;&gt; So you can do options.\n\n346\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.208\n&gt;&gt; You can,\nyou most definitely can, actually,\n\n347\n00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:56.310\nlet's see if we can play to ten,\nusing this exact same thing.\n\n348\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.640\nSo now if we say goal and\n\n349\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.280\nfive, I'm like,\nlet's do the same thing we were doing.\n\n350\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.290\nInstead of now playing the five,\nwe should be playing to ten,\n\n351\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.150\nlet's see if that works.\n\n352\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.941\nAnd then one, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, eight,\n\n353\n00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:16.960\nnine, ten, and boom, computer wins.\n\n354\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.562\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n355\n00:22:17.562 --> 00:22:21.424\n&gt;&gt; Boom, so there we have our scores set\nup, we still may have to do some tweaking,\n\n356\n00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:24.957\nbut that was our initial goal in this\nepisode, and that's what we have.\n\n357\n00:22:24.957 --> 00:22:29.097\nAnd notice, by creating these objects,\nthat the game is more or\n\n358\n00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.870\nless asking questions of.\n\n359\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.178\nIt all gets a little more readable,\na little easier to understand,\n\n360\n00:22:35.178 --> 00:22:37.377\na little easier to maintain\nin my personal view.\n\n361\n00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:41.800\nAgain, not necessarily saying this\nis the best way or the only way.\n\n362\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.680\nBut, hey scoreboard, isThereaWinner,\nyes, well, whoIsTheWinner?\n\n363\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.668\nThey won, reset the scoreboard and\nreset the game.\n\n364\n00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:54.990\nAnd really, we could pull this out into\nreset the game for the respective game.\n\n365\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.350\nSo do keep that in mind, but\nour scoreboard's ready to go,\n\n366\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.970\nwe have one final thing to\nactually be able to play, and\n\n367\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:08.670\nthat's setting up collisions\nbetween the paddle and the ball.\n\n368\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.509\nIt shouldn't take too much work,\nbut you never know,\n\n369\n00:23:12.509 --> 00:23:14.148\nthings could get a little crazy.\n\n370\n00:23:14.148 --> 00:23:17.750\n&gt;&gt; Wow, creating the scoreboard, we did\nit in one episode, it was fantastic.\n\n371\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.149\nAnd before we move on, Justin, do you\nhave anything else you'd like to say?\n\n372\n00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:23.535\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are definitely close to\nactually being able to play, and\n\n373\n00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.450\nsee if we can win.\n\n374\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.610\nI will tell you, the ball speed that we're\ncurrently running at might be a little\n\n375\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.520\nmuch on this tiny little game board.\n\n376\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.786\nThat's kind of like getting\na serve from Agassi or\n\n377\n00:23:33.786 --> 00:23:38.621\none of the Serena sisters,\nwhere'd it go, I just lost, it's.\n\n378\n00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:40.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're real close,\n\n379\n00:23:40.907 --> 00:23:43.784\nwe just need those collisions,\nmaybe a little bit of cleanup.\n\n380\n00:23:43.784 --> 00:23:46.688\nAnd then we'll have at least\na first draft of a game, now,\n\n381\n00:23:46.688 --> 00:23:49.200\nwe could always make this better, right?\n\n382\n00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.921\nInstead of this console.log,\nwe can put up a splash screen, all right,\n\n383\n00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:57.017\nlet me draw an image, and say, hey,\nyou're the winner, or congratulations.\n\n384\n00:23:57.017 --> 00:24:00.554\n[SOUND] So definitely stay tuned,\n\n385\n00:24:00.554 --> 00:24:05.615\nwe're moving toward the finale,\nso to speak.\n\n386\n00:24:05.615 --> 00:24:10.223\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, well, HTML5 Canvas Project,\nthere's a lot of episodes, see them all,\n\n387\n00:24:10.223 --> 00:24:14.456\nbecause you'll be glad you did, we're\ngetting very close to that homage to Pong\n\n388\n00:24:14.456 --> 00:24:17.160\nthat we have been building,\nand I am thrilled.\n\n389\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.170\nAnd make sure you take a look\nat our course library,\n\n390\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.350\nall the hundreds of videos\nthat are over there.\n\n391\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.190\nThere's all kinds of ways for\nyou to go further, and by the way,\n\n392\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.910\ntell everybody you know about DevProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n393\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.907\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n394\n00:24:28.907 --> 00:24:30.280\n&gt;&gt;

Well, that's because currently\nwe are not detecting collisions,\n\n11\n00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:45.425\nthus the title of this episode, right?\n\n12\n00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:50.666\nWe need to be able to determine,\nhey, has the ball hit the paddle?\n\n13\n00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.860\nEither left or right, and if it has,\nwe need to take appropriate actions.\n\n14\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.968\nNow the way have this set up, we have the\ngame kind of moderating everything, right.\n\n15\n00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:03.238\nThe game is like let me do\nthese checks and boom, okay?\n\n16\n00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:07.798\nNow it does not have the ability\nto ask either the paddle or\n\n17\n00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:12.649\nthe ball, like hey,\nhas something hit something, right?\n\n18\n00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.744\nSo that's ultimately what we're\ngoing to do in this episode.\n\n19\n00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.677\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited, let's just get going cuz I\nwanna find out why in the world [LAUGH] is\n\n20\n00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:21.684\nit not connecting?\n\n21\n00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:23.775\nWhy isn't it hitting, shooting it back?\n\n22\n00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:27.219\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's actually come into the code here.\n\n23\n00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.333\nAnd we'll take a look at where our we,\nwhat do we have set up, and\n\n24\n00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.388\nwhat do we need to do?\n\n25\n00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:32.357\n&gt;&gt; Yes, good.\n\n26\n00:01:32.357 --> 00:01:36.153\n&gt;&gt; So right now our main kind of\ngame board, if we come over here,\n\n27\n00:01:36.153 --> 00:01:37.766\njust you can win, right?\n\n28\n00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.500\nAnd as soon as you win-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can win.\n\n29\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Boom, it starts over and we have\nall these pieces right, ready to go.\n\n30\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340\nNow, something I'm gonna\ndo is the scoreboard.\n\n31\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.338\nI'm just gonna remove this goal optional\nparameter, just because we wanna play\n\n32\n00:01:53.338 --> 00:01:56.172\nthe five, because five is\ngonna be pretty quick to test.\n\n33\n00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.831\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We can probably even run that down to\n\n34\n00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.147\ntwo if we needed to.\n\n35\n00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:03.144\nBut we have our ball and\nour two paddles, and\n\n36\n00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:06.795\nnotice the paddles are being\npassed the ball, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:10.888\nAnd then we have our scoreboard, and if\nthe scoreboard reports there's a winner,\n\n38\n00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:12.596\nthen we're doing the winner now.\n\n39\n00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:15.945\nWe could always come back and\nclean this up and do some tweaking.\n\n40\n00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:18.445\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But right now our main goal is to,\n\n41\n00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:22.550\nwhen it hits the paddle,\nwe want it to bounce, right.\n\n42\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.685\nWe don't want it to actually score for\neither the player or the computer.\n\n43\n00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:32.944\nBut since I'm passing in the ball, well,\nlet's go look at human player paddle.\n\n44\n00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.832\nI'm passing the ball down the paddle,\nand actually for\n\n45\n00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:38.239\nthe exact same thing in\nthe computer paddles.\n\n46\n00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.983\nBecause all the computer paddles are based\ncurrently off the simple computer paddle,\n\n47\n00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:43.477\nthat doesn't have to be the case.\n\n48\n00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:48.639\nI could always change that, but\nnow I'm passing in the ball.\n\n49\n00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.747\nWell, this sets us up for some interesting\ncomputer strategies, number one,\n\n50\n00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:58.946\nlike the paddle could track the ball and\nyou could never win if it was really good.\n\n51\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.365\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n52\n00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:05.325\n&gt;&gt; However, the other thing is, well,\nthe paddle should be able to report,\n\n53\n00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.158\nhey, the ball just hit me.\n\n54\n00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:11.670\nAnd then by reporting that, the game can\nsay, hey ball, I need you to turn around.\n\n55\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.963\nNow this is not the only way to do this,\n\n56\n00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:17.063\nwe can actually hide this\nlogic behind the scenes.\n\n57\n00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.553\nThe paddle and the ball,\nand all of these things,\n\n58\n00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:21.584\nyou can actually put that logic inside.\n\n59\n00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.580\nNow I've pulled that up just so\nwe can think about it.\n\n60\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.928\n&gt;&gt; So you were saying before that your\naim, so to speak, no pun intended,\n\n61\n00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:34.285\nis for the paddle to detect the collision,\nto detect the ball, right?\n\n62\n00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n63\n00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and that is partly just because,\n\n64\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.090\nwell that's a decision that I've made.\n\n65\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.821\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But also I think you'll see hopefully\n\n66\n00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.227\nas we go through this that\nthat kinda falls out and\n\n67\n00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:49.010\nmakes a little more sense to the mind.\n\n68\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.206\nSo if we come over here,\nnot only just to HumanPlayerPaddle, or\n\n69\n00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:55.151\nthe SimpleComputerPaddle,\n\n70\n00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.676\nreally to the paddle, the paddle\nbecomes aware of the ball, right.\n\n71\n00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:05.418\nAnd if you can say, hey, did the paddle\n\n72\n00:04:05.418 --> 00:04:10.293\nhit the ball, you could do that.\n\n73\n00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.347\nHowever, the paddle on the left and\n\n74\n00:04:12.347 --> 00:04:16.465\nthe paddle on the right actually have\na little bit different behavior.\n\n75\n00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:23.274\nSo if it's a left paddle, that might not\nwork exactly the same as the right paddle.\n\n76\n00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:27.978\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to create the same method.\n\n77\n00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.206\nBut the way that it returns yes or\nno is gonna be a little bit different,\n\n78\n00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:34.128\ndepending on whether it's a human\nplayer or computer player.\n\n79\n00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:37.849\nSince that's the case,\nwe should probably pull\n\n80\n00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.659\nthis method up not from the paddle\nkind of implementation, but\n\n81\n00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:48.030\nup into the actual first level of\nhuman players and computer players.\n\n82\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.552\nNow, there's a bunch of\ndifferent ways to do this,\n\n83\n00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:54.444\nbut I think this makes\na little more sense.\n\n84\n00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:57.491\nNow, if that's the case, as it stands,\n\n85\n00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:00.812\nwe may not need to ball\nto be passed down here.\n\n86\n00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:04.567\nBut we're just keeping that very\nconsistent cuz if we ever wanna come back\n\n87\n00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:08.338\nand change the paddle implementation\nin general, then that would work.\n\n88\n00:05:08.338 --> 00:05:13.004\nBut let's think about his,\nthe human player paddle,\n\n89\n00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:19.712\nsince it knows about the ball, it should\nbe able to say hey, I got hit, right.\n\n90\n00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:20.757\nLet's see here.\n\n91\n00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:27.750\nLet's say collided with ball, and\nthis method is going to say for\n\n92\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.106\nthe human player,\nit's gonna return a yes or no.\n\n93\n00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:34.945\nAnd so that's gonna be a true or false.\n\n94\n00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.742\nSo we can use that for\na decision making process.\n\n95\n00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:43.077\nReturn, and since it's on the left,\n\n96\n00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:48.875\nreally what we want to check\nis to see if the x position,\n\n97\n00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:54.817\nplus the width of the paddle,\nplus the radius, right?\n\n98\n00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:56.237\nWe have to do something with that.\n\n99\n00:05:56.237 --> 00:06:01.103\nSo it's probably gonna to be easier if\nwe actually do a little bit of trial and\n\n100\n00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:06.440\nerror if we so need to, then we'll back\nup, and we'll do some drawing so to speak.\n\n101\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.543\nSo if the ball.x, right?\n\n102\n00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:13.251\nAnd the ball's right here,\n\n103\n00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.422\nif the ball.x is less than the,\n\n104\n00:06:17.422 --> 00:06:23.758\nthis .x plus this .height\nplus this.radius,\n\n105\n00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:30.264\nnot this .radius but\nthe ball's radius, okay.\n\n106\n00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:35.156\nSo what I'm saying is the ball\nhas collided with this\n\n107\n00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:38.166\nif it's within that distance.\n\n108\n00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:44.532\nNow, that's only true if it hits the outer\nranges of the top and bottom, right.\n\n109\n00:06:44.532 --> 00:06:49.785\nSo really what we want is withInX.\n\n110\n00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:56.635\nSo is it withInX and\nwithInY, so what is withInY?\n\n111\n00:06:56.635 --> 00:07:00.371\nWell, if the ball's y-position,\n\n112\n00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:04.951\nlet's just keep this spacing appropriate,\n\n113\n00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:09.177\nif the ball's y-position is less than.\n\n114\n00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:13.054\nActually, let me rephrase that,\n\n115\n00:07:13.054 --> 00:07:17.607\ngreater than or equal to this Y, right.\n\n116\n00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.230\nSo do they lie at the same level?\n\n117\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.682\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n118\n00:07:21.682 --> 00:07:26.614\n&gt;&gt; Or\nthe balls' Y position is less than or\n\n119\n00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:32.298\nequal to this.y plus this.height, okay.\n\n120\n00:07:32.298 --> 00:07:36.955\nSo essentially, does it lie between\nthe two edges of the paddle, and\n\n121\n00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:39.778\nif it does, we want it to say it collided.\n\n122\n00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:43.736\nNow within Y and within X,\nthey both have to be true.\n\n123\n00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:46.872\nSo it has to be in this distance,\nand it has to hit.\n\n124\n00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:50.322\nSo I'm gonna return withInY and\n\n125\n00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:55.082\nwithInX, Just like that.\n\n126\n00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:59.091\nNow that we have that for\nthe human player paddle,\n\n127\n00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:02.440\nlet's just see what happens in the game.\n\n128\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.544\nRight, so\nI'm actually going to modify the ball,\n\n129\n00:08:07.544 --> 00:08:12.766\nso to speak, and\njust make this 5, actually -5,\n\n130\n00:08:12.766 --> 00:08:16.890\nso it's coming toward the player.\n\n131\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.010\nAnd I'm gonna turn off the vertical\nmotion so we can get, we're\n\n132\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.480\ndoing a little bit of testing here, so-\n&gt;&gt; Little horizontal.\n\n133\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.588\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what we want to do is\n\n134\n00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:36.834\nif the player collided with ball then we\n\n135\n00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:44.029\njust want to say console.log('collision\n\n136\n00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:48.220\ndetected'), like so.\n\n137\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.550\nAnd so we're gonna refresh and\nyou'll notice somethings\n\n138\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.303\ngoing on cuz we're getting a bunch\nof collisions detected, right?\n\n139\n00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:00.470\nSo, why is that?\n\n140\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why is that touching, right?\n\n141\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Collisions get a little weird.\n\n142\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.260\nSo, let's go see.\n\n143\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.748\nLet's refresh and make sure that persists.\n\n144\n00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:13.257\nSo notice, it's always kind of, [SOUND],\n\n145\n00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:19.306\nit's still passing through cuz I'm\nnot telling the ball to do anything.\n\n146\n00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:21.260\nBut it's always detecting\nthese collisions.\n\n147\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.610\nSo let's go and\ndo a little bit of debugging here.\n\n148\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.390\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging.\n\n149\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.280\n&gt;&gt; So here's a little bit different\nmethod of debugging that should,\n\n150\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.878\nas long as you have the side open,\nthe console open, this should be fine.\n\n151\n00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:39.897\nWhat I'm gonna do, is I'm just going to\nput a debugger statement here, and now,\n\n152\n00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:42.250\nwe're gonna bring this up and see where,\n\n153\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.840\nI think I got my,\nI think there's a logic error somewhere.\n\n154\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.570\nI think I might have my signs messed up,\nbut we'll see in just a moment, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.870\nSo if I refresh, and\nnotice it stops right there, and\n\n156\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.390\nit stopped within the collidedWithBall.\n\n157\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.290\nNow if I say withinX, it's false.\n\n158\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.610\nWithinY, it's false.\n\n159\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.780\nBut it's not, right?\n\n160\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.360\nWe actually have them kind of lined up.\n\n161\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.770\nAnd just to show you that, our width and\n\n162\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.670\ny looks like it's a little weird, right?\n\n163\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.240\nSo that's interesting, but also, well,\n\n164\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.770\nlet's look at within y, within y,\nlet's debug and we're moving over,\n\n165\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.050\nwe're moving over, we're moving over.\n\n166\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.410\nSo I can step through all of these frames.\n\n167\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.550\nAnd now we know that within\ny should not report true.\n\n168\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.190\nSo within y is true,\nwithin x is still true.\n\n169\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.520\nSo I have some logic\nerrors here somewhere.\n\n170\n00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.380\nSo let's go try to figure these\nout by looking at the playerX,\n\n171\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.020\nno, I can't access this\ncuz I'm out of scope.\n\n172\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n173\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.110\n&gt;&gt; I am so silly.\n\n174\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.404\nI should be able to go with this.X.\n\n175\n00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:10.468\nSo this.X is 30.\n\n176\n00:11:10.468 --> 00:11:15.803\nthis.Y is 30, and then this.height is 200.\n\n177\n00:11:15.803 --> 00:11:22.007\nAnd this .width, Is 26.7,\n\n178\n00:11:22.007 --> 00:11:27.340\nwe'll just say 27 and\nthen what about the ball?\n\n179\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.600\nThe ball's radius is 20, so\nlooks like we have some logic errors.\n\n180\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.720\nHere's my recommendation about\nwhat to do when this happens, and\n\n181\n00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.150\nthat's actually draw a picture.\n\n182\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.850\nSo, hopefully,\nwe can kind of reason through this and\n\n183\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.280\nsee where has our logic made a mistake.\n\n184\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.580\nSo, if we can come over to the Sky Cam,\n\n185\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.900\ndraw a picture to figure things out,\nwe'll hopefully get this all squared away.\n\n186\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.330\nSo, now that we're over\nhere on the Sky Cam,\n\n187\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.010\nlet's just do a quick little\ndoodle to kinda reason it out.\n\n188\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.690\nHere is our player, right?\n\n189\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.800\nAnd, here's our little ball.\n\n190\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.430\nAnd a ball,\nlet's say when the ball hits right here.\n\n191\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.140\nWe want this to shoot off in\nthe other direction, right?\n\n192\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.170\nIt's coming this way,\nwe want it to shoot off this direction.\n\n193\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.910\nNow, what that means is\nwe have this reference.\n\n194\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.202\nHere's our x and our y of our paddle.\n\n195\n00:12:22.202 --> 00:12:27.850\nAnd then we also have our x and\nour y of our ball.\n\n196\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.070\nSo, there's our ball.\n\n197\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.860\nReally, what we want to look for is,\n\n198\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.530\ndoes this y lie between y and\ny plus the height.\n\n199\n00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:46.695\nAll right, now,\nwe've talked about this little bit before,\n\n200\n00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:53.550\nbut also does this x, if we come down\nhere, we haven't really changed the x,\n\n201\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.070\nbut does this x,\nis it within this distance?\n\n202\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:03.140\nAnd really, what we wanna know, and\nI think this is where I get this little\n\n203\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.760\nbit of logic error, does this x,\nis it within a radius of this front face?\n\n204\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.560\nSo really, what we want is x plus\nthe width, and is that, x plus the width\n\n205\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.620\nplus, then we can kind of make\nthis opposite line the radius,\n\n206\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.460\nis this x within that distance from here?\n\n207\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.350\nSo let's think about that.\n\n208\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.040\nLet's write our little expression here.\n\n209\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.405\nSo if this is bx, what we wanna test for\n\n210\n00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:47.699\nwithin x is, is bx within px\n\n211\n00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:54.230\nplus the width of the paddle.\n\n212\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.415\nThat's not how you spell width.\n\n213\n00:13:56.415 --> 00:14:00.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The width, let's try that again,\n\n214\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.140\nof the paddle plus the ball's radius.\n\n215\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.500\nNow, what do I mean within?\n\n216\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.854\nWell, on the left side,\nif it is less than or equal to,\n\n217\n00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:20.417\nso if bx is less than or\nequal to the paddle's x plus\n\n218\n00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:26.180\nthe paddle's width plus the ball's radius.\n\n219\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.630\nOkay, now that looks very\nsimilar to what we have, so\n\n220\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.188\nI think our reasoning was correct.\n\n221\n00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:32.957\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n222\n00:14:32.957 --> 00:14:36.890\n&gt;&gt; But now, that means we might have\na bug in what we actually wrote,\n\n223\n00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.590\nso-\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back and\n\n224\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.592\ncheck it out and\nlet's take a look at the screen here.\n\n225\n00:14:42.592 --> 00:14:46.910\nSo within x, the ball, and\nactually let's put an equal to here.\n\n226\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.546\nThe ball's x is less than the paddle's x,\nwhich is this in this case.\n\n227\n00:14:51.546 --> 00:14:52.385\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n228\n00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Plus the height.\n\n229\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.590\nI am silly.\n\n230\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.740\nAnd then the ball's radius.\n\n231\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.250\nThat's a little better.\n\n232\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:06.024\nWhile we're at it, let's double check\nthe ball's y is greater than or\n\n233\n00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:12.952\nequal to, so coming down, the paddle's y,\nwhich is that lower left-hand corner,\n\n234\n00:15:12.952 --> 00:15:17.030\nor the ball's y is &lt;=\nthis.y + this.height.\n\n235\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.730\nNow, should that be an or?\n\n236\n00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.470\nLet's think about this.\n\n237\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.490\nCan it be either/or or\nshould it be both if it's within y?\n\n238\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.510\nWell, it has to be both.\n\n239\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say both.\n\n240\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n241\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.940\nSo, we need to change that to an and.\n\n242\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.017\nAnd, this simple logic errors can\ndefinitely cause some issues when you're\n\n243\n00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:37.280\ndoing thing like this.\n\n244\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But once you get them worked out for\n\n245\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.110\none, they kinda just fall out for\nthe other.\n\n246\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.150\nSo let's go see if changing those\nlittle bit of, little bit there,\n\n247\n00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.800\nchanges how we proceed.\n\n248\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.960\nAnd notice it's not saying anything.\n\n249\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.202\nAnd now it did.\n\n250\n00:15:56.202 --> 00:15:57.272\nThat's good.\n\n251\n00:15:57.272 --> 00:15:59.222\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because now only when it hits\n\n252\n00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:01.492\nthe paddle is it gonna detect collisions.\n\n253\n00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:04.264\nNow Now that we have that for\nthe HumanPlayerPaddle, and\n\n254\n00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:05.997\nit'll be a little bit different for\n\n255\n00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:09.370\nthe right hand because then\nthe reference is a little bit different.\n\n256\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.790\nBut we'll talk about that\nin just a little bit.\n\n257\n00:16:12.808 --> 00:16:16.620\nLet's see, over in the game,\nif the collision is detected,\n\n258\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.460\nwhat do you want to do?\n\n259\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.120\nWell, you want he ball to\nbounce in the x direction.\n\n260\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.730\nIf we come over to the ball,\nwe don't have a bounceX, right?\n\n261\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.370\nWe actually want to add a bounceX.\n\n262\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.010\nAnd there are more elegant ways to\ndo this, where you can bounce and\n\n263\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.040\ngive it a direction, right,\nis it x or y, and then a value.\n\n264\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.265\nBut we're just gonna\nkeep this very simple,\n\n265\n00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:48.220\ndx = -1 times this.dx, just like so, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.384\nNow that we have that method available,\nwell,\n\n267\n00:16:51.384 --> 00:16:56.580\nwe already had a little bit of collision\ndetection here with the canvas.\n\n268\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.175\nBut then between two entities\nit gets a little weird.\n\n269\n00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:04.380\nWe wanna say ball.bounceX(), just like so.\n\n270\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.043\nSo if the player collides with the ball,\n\n271\n00:17:08.043 --> 00:17:12.692\ncollided with the ball,\nthen refresh, and boom.\n\n272\n00:17:12.692 --> 00:17:14.384\nNow we're so, but then-\n&gt;&gt; Whoops.\n\n273\n00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:17.610\n&gt;&gt; The other side doesn't work, man.\n\n274\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:23.265\nSo let's come back, now what we need\nto do for the computer paddles?\n\n275\n00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:25.968\nWell, if we come over\nhere to computer paddle,\n\n276\n00:17:25.968 --> 00:17:30.500\nthere's bounceY, that's fine,\nthat's actually for the paddle.\n\n277\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.840\nWe don't have any way\n\n278\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.920\nto determine whether the ball has\ninteracted with the right-hand paddles.\n\n279\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.602\nAnd as I said in a previous episode,\n\n280\n00:17:38.602 --> 00:17:41.730\nwe could actually delineate\nbetween a left and a right.\n\n281\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.020\nAnd then have the left and\n\n282\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.960\nthe right have collidedWithBall\nimplement these different.\n\n283\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.870\nAnd then all you do is you say,\n\n284\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.440\nit's a left paddle,\nit's a right paddle, and then.\n\n285\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.900\nBut as it stands, the way we've chosen\nto implement this, things are good.\n\n286\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.572\n¨Now, there are other ways to do this, I'm\ntrying to build logic that's a little more\n\n287\n00:17:59.572 --> 00:18:03.978\nstraightforward than maybe other times.\n\n288\n00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:07.255\nBut since SimpleComputerPaddle\nis kind of our basis,\n\n289\n00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:09.970\nwe should probably put that in here,\nright?\n\n290\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:17.050\nSo, let's say collidedWithBall,\nand we still need a withInX.\n\n291\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.483\nAnd well, we'll get to that,\nand a withInY And\n\n292\n00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:31.320\nwe'll get to that, and\nwe need to return withinX &amp;&amp; withinY.\n\n293\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.491\nAll right, it has to accomplish both.\n\n294\n00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:36.505\nNow, let's think about this, withinY,\n\n295\n00:18:36.505 --> 00:18:40.870\nI don't think withinY is\nactually gonna change any, right?\n\n296\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.860\nWe're still looking up and down direction,\nand that's not different for\n\n297\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.880\nthe respective paddles.\n\n298\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.474\nSo we can come over to\nthe HumanPlayerPaddle, and\n\n299\n00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:49.599\njust copy that line.\n\n300\n00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:53.660\nI can just grab this right here, and copy.\n\n301\n00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.377\nCome over to the SimpleComputerPaddle,\nand then paste, like so.\n\n302\n00:18:58.377 --> 00:19:01.778\nNow the withinX, though,\nsince we're now on the opposite side,\n\n303\n00:19:01.778 --> 00:19:03.810\nwe don't have to add that width.\n\n304\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.570\nWe're looking to see,\nis the ball's x position\n\n305\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.922\nwithin a radius distance of\nthe paddle's x position, right?\n\n306\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.870\nOkay, okay, well, how does one do that?\n\n307\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:21.962\nWell, the ball's x is less than or\nequal to this.x\n\n308\n00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:26.025\n+ ball.radius, just like that.\n\n309\n00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:29.610\nNow, we have a circular\ncolliding with a rectangular,\n\n310\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.490\nI think doing the two different directions\nis probably a little bit easier.\n\n311\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.390\nIf everything was circular, you could\nprobably do distances between, and\n\n312\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.000\nlook for two radii, and\nthings of that nature.\n\n313\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.210\nBut there's collidedWithBall, boom.\n\n314\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:49.381\nJust for now, let's keep these separate,\nand say computer.collidedWithBall.\n\n315\n00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:54.735\nAnd console.log('collision detected'),\n\n316\n00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:57.924\ncollision detected, okay?\n\n317\n00:19:57.924 --> 00:20:00.760\nOkay, so now if I refresh.\n\n318\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.460\nSomething's not right,\nwe have another one of those errors.\n\n319\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.590\nLet's see here.\n&gt;&gt; But were closer, Justin, we're closer.\n\n320\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.620\n&gt;&gt; We are, we are.\n\n321\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.120\nSo if we come back to\nthe SimpleComputerPaddle, let's see here.\n\n322\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.662\nIs the ball's y greater than this y?\n\n323\n00:20:18.662 --> 00:20:20.489\nThere's your SimpleComputerPaddle.\n\n324\n00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:28.556\nBut is the ball's x less\nthan this.x ball.radius?\n\n325\n00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:34.390\nHm, well it may be that we have\nto come back over the Skycam,\n\n326\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.060\nwe gotta draw a little more.\n\n327\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.716\nIt's a little difficult,\nand this is intentional,\n\n328\n00:20:38.716 --> 00:20:41.675\nbecause not everything is rainbows and\nunicorns, right?\n\n329\n00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:46.720\nSo let's come over and do a little bit\nof drawing just to see the difference.\n\n330\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.260\nSo there's our previous one,\nright, we had our height.\n\n331\n00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.513\nBut now let's look at the opposite paddle.\n\n332\n00:20:53.881 --> 00:21:01.790\nIf i look at the opposite paddle, and then\nwe have our ball coming over here, right?\n\n333\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.910\nWell, here is our paddle's top left,\nright?\n\n334\n00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.031\nSo this is px and py.\n\n335\n00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:13.590\nNow I'm changing conventions,\njust so we can talk about them.\n\n336\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.377\nSo that's a p, just in case.\n\n337\n00:21:15.377 --> 00:21:22.873\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then here, that's bx, by.\n\n338\n00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:25.380\nAnd then this is our respective height and\nour width.\n\n339\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.050\nNow, what we wanna know is,\nis this within a radius, right?\n\n340\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.100\nA ball radius of each other.\n\n341\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:40.140\nAnd, is this up and down,\ndoes it still lie within that same chunk?\n\n342\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.530\nSo that means that we want bx\n\n343\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:50.388\nis less than or equal to px,\n\n344\n00:21:50.388 --> 00:21:53.885\nright?\n\n345\n00:21:53.885 --> 00:21:59.670\nNope, nope, nope, nope, plus, and\nwe want to see if it's within.\n\n346\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.310\nThat's where we, it's not plus\nit's actually to the left, right?\n\n347\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:09.764\nSo we need a minus sign, and that is-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's returning to the left,\n\n348\n00:22:09.764 --> 00:22:10.790\nwhich is the negative.\n\n349\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what we wanna see is,\n\n350\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.610\nis the ball's x position less\nthan px minus the radius?\n\n351\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.048\nAnd this is where those alternative\nkind of, it all starts at the upper\n\n352\n00:22:22.048 --> 00:22:26.940\nleft-hand corner, coordinate system\nthat sometimes throws you for a loop.\n\n353\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.130\nSo now that we've figured that out,\n\n354\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.455\nactually let's go see if\nwe can get that to work.\n\n355\n00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:39.184\nSo get back into the code here, and\nwe change this to a minus sign, right?\n\n356\n00:22:39.184 --> 00:22:44.587\nAnd we refresh, and hm, still getting\n\n357\n00:22:44.587 --> 00:22:49.640\nsome weirdness, and why is that?\n\n358\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.720\nSo, If we look,\nwhen is this collision being detected?\n\n359\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.380\nWell we should probably put our\ndebugger statement back in there.\n\n360\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.220\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n361\n00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.360\n&gt;&gt; So debugger and refresh.\n\n362\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.585\nAnd now if we look, and if we move,\n\n363\n00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:16.728\nand we move again, and I just wanna see.\n\n364\n00:23:20.186 --> 00:23:24.545\nSo there's collision detected,\ncollision detected, collision detected.\n\n365\n00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:26.800\nHm, so why is that?\n\n366\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.071\nIf we come over here and\nwe look at the game, let's make sure,\n\n367\n00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:34.192\ncomputer.collidedwithBall, collision\ndetected, okay.\n\n368\n00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:39.390\nIf we come over to the\nSimpleComputerPaddle, well that's right.\n\n369\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:44.715\nIs it maybe this one,\nthat the ball.y is is greater than this.y\n\n370\n00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:50.080\n&amp;&amp; ball.y is less than\nthis.y + this.height, hmm.\n\n371\n00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.900\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, you mentioned\nthe coordinates being shifted.\n\n372\n00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.579\nAnd since we have a minus, do we have to\nadjust anything else, or what's going on?\n\n373\n00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:00.210\n&gt;&gt; You know what, Zach,\nI think you might be onto something here.\n\n374\n00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.901\nActually, I think you\nmight be exactly correct.\n\n375\n00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:08.825\nSo let's go ahead and take a look,\nthis is one of those Weirdnesses,\n\n376\n00:24:08.825 --> 00:24:11.900\nif we look here, I think this is it.\n\n377\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.878\nI don't think we wanna check to\nsee if the ball's x is less than,\n\n378\n00:24:14.878 --> 00:24:16.490\nbecause that would be to the left.\n\n379\n00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.728\nWe actually wanna see if it's to the\nright, we wanna see if it's greater than.\n\n380\n00:24:20.728 --> 00:24:23.207\nPlus x is going the opposite way, so\n\n381\n00:24:23.207 --> 00:24:28.180\nI think greater than would change that,\nand you know what?\n\n382\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.828\nJust for giggles, let's go a head and\nchange that to ball.bounceX.\n\n383\n00:24:33.828 --> 00:24:37.820\nRight, so if it hits the computer pallet,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, so\n\n384\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.280\nnow let's refresh.\n\n385\n00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.340\nAnd I guess I actually need\nto move the paddle into play.\n\n386\n00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.910\nWe had a little bit of sticking there\nbecause the ball's moving pretty slow\n\n387\n00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:49.940\ncomparatively.\n\n388\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.400\nAnd let's speed that up just\na little bit so we can see.\n\n389\n00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.400\nAnd let's go -5, no,\n\n390\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.180\nlet's keep this as -5 and\ninstead of our computer panel\n\n391\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.705\nactually moving.\n\n392\n00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.030\nSo this update, I'm actually just\ngonna comment out this update and\n\n393\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.940\nhave it not move.\n\n394\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.420\nSo this doesn't do anything.\n\n395\n00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.393\nThat's good, it doesn't bounce.\n\n396\n00:25:24.393 --> 00:25:29.858\nWhat if we change the computer\npaddle to be top and bottom?\n\n397\n00:25:29.858 --> 00:25:35.296\nLet's actually move the panels down,\n\n398\n00:25:35.296 --> 00:25:40.899\nin general, to canvas.height divided\n\n399\n00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:46.430\nby 2- canvas.height divided by 3.\n\n400\n00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.370\nAnd that's because that's\nwhat the height is.\n\n401\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.587\nSo, if we refresh, boom and then boom.\n\n402\n00:25:54.587 --> 00:25:59.156\nAnd now we actually have a back and\nforth bouncing ball.\n\n403\n00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.721\n&gt;&gt; It's exciting and\nboring at the same time.\n\n404\n00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:02.038\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n405\n00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:04.090\nCollusions are detected, right?\n\n406\n00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.990\nAnd that's exactly what we wanted.\n\n407\n00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:12.598\nAnd so I'm actually gonna\nmove this down a little more.\n\n408\n00:26:12.598 --> 00:26:19.138\nSo if we refresh, bouncing, bouncing,\nand then there's our bouncing ball.\n\n409\n00:26:19.138 --> 00:26:21.325\nWe actually are moving back and forth,\n\n410\n00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:25.650\nand since this is the simple growing\npaddle that I've altered, guess what?\n\n411\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.480\nIt's still, actually, growing.\n\n412\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.300\nNow, there are our detect collisions,\ngood.\n\n413\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.960\nWe have it done, it's good.\n\n414\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.200\nThe paddles have become aware of the ball,\nand the collisions have been detected.\n\n415\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.715\nNow, it did take a little bit of work,\na little bit of debugging.\n\n416\n00:26:41.715 --> 00:26:44.428\nBecause well, those coordinate\nsystems will always throw you for\n\n417\n00:26:44.428 --> 00:26:47.515\na loop because they're a little bit\ndifferent than maybe you're used to.\n\n418\n00:26:47.515 --> 00:26:48.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n419\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.583\n&gt;&gt; But also, it just takes\na little bit of thought, right?\n\n420\n00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:53.564\nWhat am I checking for, what's going on?\n\n421\n00:26:53.564 --> 00:26:58.525\nAnd that's why I'm a big proponent of\ncollidedWithBall collidedWithBall.\n\n422\n00:26:58.525 --> 00:27:01.335\n&gt;&gt; Well Justin, couldn't we have\nmade the ball aware of the paddles,\n\n423\n00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:03.735\ninstead of the other way around and\ngot the same result?\n\n424\n00:27:03.735 --> 00:27:04.807\n&gt;&gt; We absolutely could have.\n\n425\n00:27:04.807 --> 00:27:07.790\nWe could've passed both the paddles\nin the construction of the ball.\n\n426\n00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.012\nAnd then you could ask the ball,\nhey, did you hit a paddle, right?\n\n427\n00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:14.722\nBut here's the reason why\nI chose to do it this way.\n\n428\n00:27:14.722 --> 00:27:17.753\nIf we passed in the paddle to the ball,\nwhich we would have to rearrange some of\n\n429\n00:27:17.753 --> 00:27:20.801\nthis code, right, the ball would have\nto be constructed after said paddle.\n\n430\n00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:22.444\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:27:22.444 --> 00:27:23.379\n&gt;&gt; We would have to say, hey,\n\n432\n00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:26.228\nball, did you hit the left paddle or\nthe right paddle?\n\n433\n00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:31.160\nSo now we'd have to have two methods to\nthe ball that, hey, hit left, hit right,\n\n434\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.530\nor hit left paddle, hit right paddle.\n\n435\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.970\nAnd I think it's a little cleaner\nif you just ask the paddle,\n\n436\n00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.350\nthis is a little more uniform, hey,\ndid you collide with the ball?\n\n437\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.100\nAnd it goes, yes, and\nthen that way you can inform the ball.\n\n438\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.460\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, see how this is\n\n439\n00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.725\nrepetitive, we don't even need two of\nthese if either one of them collide.\n\n440\n00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:57.675\nThen the ball needs to bounce,\nand that is still good to go.\n\n441\n00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.106\nBut we can get the same result,\n\n442\n00:27:59.106 --> 00:28:02.645\nwe've would've just had to have written\na little more code to be specific.\n\n443\n00:28:02.645 --> 00:28:05.710\nThere are probably abstractions\nthat we can apply there.\n\n444\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.034\nBut I'm more about the thought process,\nthan this is, the best way,\n\n445\n00:28:10.034 --> 00:28:11.585\nthe only way to write it.\n\n446\n00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.600\n&gt;&gt; And one more thing too.\n\n447\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.485\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were talking about the scoring and\n\n448\n00:28:17.485 --> 00:28:19.506\nwe had set up the basic scoring and\nwhatnot.\n\n449\n00:28:19.506 --> 00:28:23.290\nAnd typically, when a game ends it\nasks you if you wanna play it again.\n\n450\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.584\nThere might even be some kind\nof a [NOISE] kind of thing.\n\n451\n00:28:26.584 --> 00:28:28.750\nCan we add anything like that?\n\n452\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, you are absolutely correct, Zach.\n\n453\n00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.060\nAs it stands now, when someone wins,\nit just immediately restarts the game.\n\n454\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.767\nIt would've probably be nice if\nit stop and you could click and\n\n455\n00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.918\nmaybe you can keep a running store.\n\n456\n00:28:40.918 --> 00:28:44.403\nMaybe there's a sound play,\nand you know what?\n\n457\n00:28:44.403 --> 00:28:48.200\nI think we're at a point with the game\nwhere I might have some people play it.\n\n458\n00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.206\nSee what they think, take input like that.\n\n459\n00:28:52.206 --> 00:28:53.851\nAnd then maybe we'll come back and\n\n460\n00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:57.377\nadd some of those feature because this\nis more or less like an MVP, right?\n\n461\n00:28:57.377 --> 00:29:00.206\nA minimal viable product,\nthis gets the point across, but\n\n462\n00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:02.704\nthere's probably some\nthings that could be added.\n\n463\n00:29:02.704 --> 00:29:05.089\nSo we definitely don't\nhave time in this episode.\n\n464\n00:29:05.089 --> 00:29:10.140\nAnd I'd like to get additional feedback,\nbut your feedback is well appreciated.\n\n465\n00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.485\nBut we may come back and add some\nadditional features like [SOUND] or\n\n466\n00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:17.332\nlike a splash screen and things like that.\n\n467\n00:29:17.332 --> 00:29:19.892\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, detecting collisions,\n\n468\n00:29:19.892 --> 00:29:23.900\nanother wonderful episode in\nthe HTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n469\n00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.385\nAnything else you'd like\nto add before we go?\n\n470\n00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think for now,\nwe have a good minimal, viable product.\n\n471\n00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.530\nWe might come back with some\nadditional features, but there's so\n\n472\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.130\nmuch more that we can do\nwith the HTML5 Canvas setup.\n\n473\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.260\nI'd definitely stay tuned\nto see what's in store.\n\n474\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.880\n&gt;&gt; And by the way, you should see every\nsingle episode of HTML5 Canvas projects\n\n475\n00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.120\nbecause they're all awesome.\n\n476\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.710\nJustin's done an amazing job.\n\n477\n00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.354\nAlso, go to our course library.\n\n478\n00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:50.686\nTake a look at the hundreds\nof videos that are there,\n\n479\n00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:53.120\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n480\n00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.167\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevProTV.\n\n481\n00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:56.300\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n482\n00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.860\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n483\n00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.743\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n484\n00:29:58.743 --> 00:29:59.870\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n485\n00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:05.588\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It is good to be here Zack,\nand how are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good and excited to take\na look at this designing an image.\n\n11\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.380\nI hear it, I keep designing an image\neditor, what exactly is that all about?\n\n12\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.647\nI mean what are you building?\n\n13\n00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:49.070\n&gt;&gt; All right so, here's my thought, let\nme set the landscape for you so to speak,\n\n14\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.830\nso you can build games with an HTML5 game,\nyou can also modify and manipulate images.\n\n15\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.090\nSo here's my thought,\na very simple image editor,\n\n16\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.930\nthat you can apply a few filters that\nwe make, now what do I mean by filter?\n\n17\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.740\nI'm talking grayscale, sepia tone,\nmaybe a brighten filter.\n\n18\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.280\nAnd then once we get that all made\nI wanna be able to save the image.\n\n19\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n20\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.730\nwe're not gonna make this full fledged,\nbut this is a thought process.\n\n21\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.130\nHow do I build these things, right?\n\n22\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.510\nWon't necessarily be fully polished, but\n\n23\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.740\nI also want to set expectation for\nan image editor.\n\n24\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.060\nBecause when I say image editors\nsome people are like, so\n\n25\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.992\nit can draw vector graphics and\nall kinda these other things and layers.\n\n26\n00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:34.420\nNo, no, no, no, you are going to load an\nimage, you are going to apply a filter and\n\n27\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.030\nthen you are going to save the image.\n\n28\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.120\nSo very, very basic but it does kinda tie\nin like, why would I need to get image\n\n29\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.555\ndata and manipulate the image data well,\nyou can add these filters as you see fit.\n\n30\n00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.840\n&gt;&gt; DevPro baby steps, so\nwhat is our first step?\n\n31\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.355\n&gt;&gt; So our first step is probably design,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do I wanna build?\n\n33\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.930\nHow do I want to interact with it?\n\n34\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.297\nWhat is it gonna look like and\nhow this all gonna tie together and\n\n35\n00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:05.650\nmy big impressive is you should always,\n\n36\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.010\nalways draw out and kinda do some labeling\nto figure out hey, what are we building?\n\n37\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.940\nLike what's going on?\n\n38\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.700\nSo we're actually gonna draw it out.\n\n39\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.590\nI'm a big fan of drawing, right?\n\n40\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.810\nOne part of problem solving\nis drawing out your layout or\n\n41\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.640\ndrawing out everything that you know and\nkinda model.\n\n42\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.790\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome over to the sky cam and\n\n43\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.980\nlet's just draw our gesture,\nor Jester, Jester?\n\n44\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Jester.\n\n45\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.470\n&gt;&gt; Jester drawing, that quick drawing\nthat doesn't have a lot of detail.\n\n46\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.430\nSo here's what I'm thinking.\n\n47\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Sketch.\n&gt;&gt; If this is our screen, right?\n\n48\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.370\nThis is what we see inside of the browser.\n\n49\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.427\nI'm kind of thinking\nmaybe a button here for\n\n50\n00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:52.073\nopen and maybe a button here for apply and\n\n51\n00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:57.280\nmaybe a little drop down box for\nthe filters.\n\n52\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.610\nSo I'm just gonna dictate that\nis this little drop down box,\n\n53\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.890\nlet's just say grayscale and we'll come\nback and label that a little more.\n\n54\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.080\nAnd then maybe a button for\nsave, right, and\n\n55\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.825\nmaybe some way to set those apart,\nthe controls so to speak.\n\n56\n00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; From this little image area portion,\n\n57\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760\nokay and\nthen this is actually gonna be our canvas.\n\n58\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.210\nAnd so when we open we'll load\nan image into the canvas and\n\n59\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.060\nthen we can have an image, right.\n\n60\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.460\nLet's just do a smiley face or\nsomething like that.\n\n61\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's do a little bit of labelling.\n\n62\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.929\nSo this is the opened image,\nand it's on the canvas.\n\n63\n00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.210\nNow how would this get here?\n\n64\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.650\nWell this is how we load\nan image on the Canvas.\n\n65\n00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:54.368\nThat's not how you spell image.\n\n66\n00:03:54.368 --> 00:04:01.850\n[LAUGH] Onto canvas, okay so when I\nclick the open, and this is kinda hard.\n\n67\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.410\nI'm thinking maybe like\nan open dialogue box or\n\n68\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.870\nsomething like when you click open on your\ncomputer you get a little open dialog box.\n\n69\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.900\nThat could be, a little tricky and then\nhere this image would be whatever it looks\n\n70\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.770\nlike on the page, unless you select,\nselect the filter.\n\n71\n00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:25.195\nAnd you apply that filter now I\ncould change that to where it just\n\n72\n00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.530\nautomatically does that.\n\n73\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.540\nBut just to save on some computation and\nthings\n\n74\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.220\nthis applies the filter that is selected,\napplies selected filter.\n\n75\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.491\nOkay, and then once you have\nthat on I'm thinking for\n\n76\n00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.470\nthese filters you only can apply one.\n\n77\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.190\nNow in a real image editor,\na full fledged one,\n\n78\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.780\nI would be able to say, I want to\ngrayscale it, I want to then brighten it,\n\n79\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.850\nthen let me apply sepia, let me grayscale\nit again, you could go crazy with that.\n\n80\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.530\nBut I think for us I think it makes\nsense just to have a single filter so\n\n81\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.920\nwe can understand how\nthings are going along.\n\n82\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.680\n&gt;&gt; The mechanics.\n\n83\n00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.700\n&gt;&gt; The mechanics and then once you\nhave this looking how you want it,\n\n84\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.160\neither grayscale, sepia,\nbrighten, whatever it may be,\n\n85\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.570\nthen you can click save and\nyou download the copy.\n\n86\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.860\nDownload a copy of the image with the\nfilter, so download the filtered image.\n\n87\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.600\nNow, when I say download it's not actually\na network request, it's just gonna\n\n88\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.730\nsimulate a download so it goes in your\ndownloads folder, and it's a copy.\n\n89\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm thinking,\n\n90\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.530\njust to make this easy,\nI'm gonna keep this fairly static.\n\n91\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.220\nThis is going to be whatever it is,\nsome height.\n\n92\n00:05:45.594 --> 00:05:47.910\nAnd then this is going to be some width.\n\n93\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.690\nAnd because this entire area, we may have\nsome interesting issues with saving.\n\n94\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.210\nWe might get some transparent\nbackgrounds and stuff.\n\n95\n00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.540\nNow, I know that\n\n96\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.880\nwe can get images that are either PNG or\nJPG.\n\n97\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.000\nI'm not sure if we can get some other\ntypes of images we may have to do some\n\n98\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.510\nresearch there but\nkinda our workflow is we load an image.\n\n99\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.400\nIt shows up here we apply, and\n\n100\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.030\nI think something here is we want to\nessentially apply no filter, right?\n\n101\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.010\nSo once we go grayscale we\ncan then say no filter and\n\n102\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.780\nthen go back to the original image.\n\n103\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.310\nSo then we can apply filter, we do\nwhatever we want to and then we click\n\n104\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.640\nsave and we get a copy of that file\nwith maybe some random file name,\n\n105\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.970\nor something like that and\nthen you can rename it.\n\n106\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.560\nNow again, not full fledged, but\nkind of an interesting take,\n\n107\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.300\nbecause with the advent of various social\nmedia, this is a fairly prominent thing.\n\n108\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.070\nAnd this will give us some insight about\na little bit how this filtering is done,\n\n109\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.330\nhow the saving is done.\n\n110\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.430\nIt will not be Inkscape, or Gimp or\n\n111\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.340\nPhotoshop any of those scale type\nof applications, that gives us\n\n112\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.715\na good starting point, a good working\npoint to, to get things rolling.\n\n113\n00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm mm I see [INAUDIBLE].\n\n114\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.980\nSo the top portion, the open the apply,\n\n115\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.370\nthe save, that's part of the editor\nthat's the editor itself, right?\n\n116\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.930\n&gt;&gt; That is, that it is and\n\n117\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.660\nyou know it kinda brings up the point that\ndo we put this on the canvas, do we not?\n\n118\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Is it exclusively on the canvas,\nor can we move it somewhere else?\n\n119\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think what I'm going to do, we\ncould put those buttons on the canvas, we\n\n120\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.650\ncould put everything in canvas, but then\nwe would have like a canvas in a canvas.\n\n121\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.990\nWhat I'm thinking is, is we can have\nvarious web development, right?\n\n122\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.270\nLet's have a button, and\nA couple of buttons or maybe a drop down.\n\n123\n00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.810\nAnd we just do standard web\nform type [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n124\n00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.220\nthen the canvas is separate.\n\n125\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.340\nThat way we can manipulate the canvas\nindependently of all of the controls.\n\n126\n00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.540\nThat makes a little more sense to\nme because manipulating buttons,\n\n127\n00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.320\nI mean that's more or less what web forms\nare for I don't have to then detect\n\n128\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.900\nareas like, I click on this part\nof the canvas that is a button.\n\n129\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.800\nNow we could do that if\nwe wanted to go crazy,\n\n130\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.360\nbut I think the canvas is only going to be\nabout the image, all of the other controls\n\n131\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.400\nare going to be separate to the actual\ncontrols or anything like that.\n\n132\n00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.010\n&gt;&gt; So you could use the editor for\nmultiple canvases?\n\n133\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.430\n&gt;&gt; We could technically use the editor for\nmultiple canvases, we could do a tiled.\n\n134\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.610\nHere's the original and here's all\nthe filters and then, I wanna save and\n\n135\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.400\nmaybe the save is a drop down, that could\nalways be a tweak that we do later.\n\n136\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.160\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n137\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.405\n&gt;&gt; I wanna save the grayscale and\nI wanna save the sepia, but for\n\n138\n00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:41.485\nnow I think one at a time is probably\na pretty good approximation.\n\n139\n00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:43.755\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see what you do,\nsir, first steps.\n\n140\n00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.445\n&gt;&gt; Well, our first steps, right?\n\n141\n00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:46.805\nAnd before we implement this interface,\n\n142\n00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.595\nwe do have a little bit of setup to do,\nright?\n\n143\n00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.545\nJust some very basic setup and\nI think it'll be pretty straightforward.\n\n144\n00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:58.045\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome down into my computer here and\n\n145\n00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:00.260\nI have simple folder, image-editor.\n\n146\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.040\nThere just, that's it,\nthere's nothing in it.\n\n147\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n148\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.000\nwe do wanna get some things kinda stubbed\n\n149\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.200\nout just in anticipation of building\nup the remainder of our interface.\n\n150\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.020\nSo let's make sure all of those\npieces work before we worry\n\n151\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.010\nabout all of the implementation details.\n\n152\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.360\nSo I'm actually going to go ahead and\nopen Atom with this.\n\n153\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.440\nSo I used atom open Atom space dot Windows\nusers, you may just have to open Atom and\n\n154\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.550\ngo to file add project folder,\nand add that project folder.\n\n155\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.603\nSo just as a reminder to that and then,\n\n156\n00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:42.024\nThe re-arranging of Windows I\ndefinitely gotta figure that out.\n\n157\n00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:44.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a constant struggle,\n\n158\n00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:50.110\nit's on the dance, it is, so this has\ncome down under the image editor and\n\n159\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.770\nlet's create a new file,\nwe're gonna call that index.html, no,\n\n160\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.650\nthere is nothing special about this file\nother than if you put this folder on\n\n161\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.570\nsomething, then index.html would\nbe immediately wanna serve that.\n\n162\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.100\nWe know that we're gonna need JavaScript,\nright?\n\n163\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.290\nThe canvas is just that.\n\n164\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:14.840\nSo we're gonna say app.js and\nyou know what?\n\n165\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.540\nNot even sure if we're gonna\nstart with CSS, maybe we don't.\n\n166\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.040\nThis is gonna create the file\nwe can always remove it if\n\n167\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.080\nwe don't need it later so main.css.\n\n168\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.850\nAll right, let's get these set up and\n\n169\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.430\nmake sure they're all good to go\nbefore we worry about anything else.\n\n170\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.530\nSo if we come back to index.html,\nif you come into Atom and\n\n171\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.030\nyou type HTML enter, it stubs this out.\n\n172\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.750\nOkay, let's just call it Image Editor,\nI know it's a very original name and\n\n173\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.010\nthen let's create a link tag.\n\n174\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.730\nNow, how am I getting all of that?\n\n175\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.360\nLet me be a little more specific.\n\n176\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.350\nSo I'm gonna hit link and I'm gonna\nhit Enter, and it fills these in for\n\n177\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.792\nyou, but that's not what I want,\nI actually want main.css.\n\n178\n00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:04.470\nAnd I'm gonna self close these and\nlet's put in our script tab.\n\n179\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.450\nSo there's script and I don't want\nthat one, I want script src=\"app.sj\"\n\n180\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.590\nnow those are built in add on by default.\n\n181\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.590\nYou get those little drop down boxes and\njust hit enter.\n\n182\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.910\nI'm just hitting enter once I\nselected those with those arrows.\n\n183\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.710\nI don't technically need the charset,\ndoesn't hurt, that's fine.\n\n184\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.510\nAll of my stuff should be UTF-8 so\nwe're good to go.\n\n185\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:33.600\nNow that I have these set up something\nthat I like to get things kinda\n\n186\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.467\nworking is in the app.js,\nI'm gonna say console.log(\n\n187\n00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:43.720\n\"working\") and for the main.css,\n\n188\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.800\nI always like to change the body's\nbackground color, just to make sure that's\n\n189\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.680\nall good to go to something really bright,\nreally festive like salmon.\n\n190\n00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.060\n&gt;&gt; You love that salmon.\n\n191\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.260\n&gt;&gt; So if we come back we should be good.\n\n192\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.650\nRight this should all work and\n\n193\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.500\nnow we can test to see if we're\nready to create the user interface.\n\n194\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.200\nHow do we open this up in Chrome?\n\n195\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.370\nWell from the command line for me I can\nactually just type open and it's HTML.\n\n196\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.760\nBut for the most part and\nthat could be a little iffy for people.\n\n197\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.390\nSo if we go to file, open file and\nthen we come to image editor, right?\n\n198\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.790\nSo I'm, I just found this on my computer,\nimage-editor.\n\n199\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.910\nAnd I go to index.html, and\nwe open, and then there it is.\n\n200\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.260\nSo the salmon background works.\n\n201\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Definitely salmon.\n\n202\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.240\n&gt;&gt; The salmon background works, and then\nthe working actually gets printed out.\n\n203\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.320\nThat is actually the extent of our setup\n\n204\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.540\none final thing though when you're\nworking with images loaded.\n\n205\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.110\nSometimes you may need to serve\nthis from an actual server.\n\n206\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.660\nWe will deal with that when and\nif we need to but as it stands, as long\n\n207\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.120\nas we have the setup we could probably\ngo ahead and get the interface going.\n\n208\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.720\nBut maybe we should focus on that cuz\nI know there's probably gonna be some\n\n209\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.426\nlayout and\nsome tweaking of IDs and classes.\n\n210\n00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:12.760\nWe have our design,\nwe have our basic setup.\n\n211\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.940\nAnd actually, let's remove that\nbackground color of salmon.\n\n212\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.195\nIt's so beautiful, but\nonly in small spurts.\n\n213\n00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:19.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n214\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.950\nthen let's remove out at.js and\n&gt;&gt; Let's make sure that we don't have\n\n215\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.280\nany rendering issues here.\n\n216\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.230\n&gt;&gt; The salmon is better than plaid,\nby the way.\n\n217\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.870\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is, it is and then,\n\n218\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.170\nlet's just say image-\n&gt;&gt; Not as busy.\n\n219\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Editor, all right so there's our image\neditor so everything's rendering it.\n\n220\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.340\nAs long as we have this setup, we should\nbe able to implement our interface,\n\n221\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.420\nactually laying things out, styling them.\n\n222\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.990\nSo on and so forth if we so choose to,\nbut maybe we shouldn't do that now,\n\n223\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.300\nmaybe we should dedicate an entire\nepisode just to laying out and\n\n224\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.400\ninstalling the image\nout of your interface.\n\n225\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so this is our episode,\ndesigning an image editor?\n\n226\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.580\nWe're just ready to go, that's fantastic!\n\n227\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.630\nAny last words?\n\n228\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is gonna be one of\nthose things where you're like,\n\n229\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.850\nthis is fairly straightforward,\nfairly straightforward.\n\n230\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.140\nWell, it got really complicated.\n\n231\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.960\nSo definitely stay tuned for ever episode,\nbecause there may not be a lot of them,\n\n232\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.320\nbut some of them may be very dense in\nwhat's going on within the episode.\n\n233\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.765\nSo Hopefully we'll see you there.\n\n234\n00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:22.200\n&gt;&gt; HTML5, Canvas projects continues\nmake sure you see all the episodes,\n\n235\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.330\nJustin's doing a marvelous\njob as he always does.\n\n236\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.000\nHey, and make sure you visit the course\nlibrary and check out all the hundreds of\n\n237\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.290\nvideos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n238\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.310\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevpro TV they'll be glad you did.\n\n239\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.920\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n240\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.710\n&gt;&gt;

It is good to see you as well,\nZack, I'm happy to be back here.\n\n8\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.690\nAnd how are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm excited because in\nthe last episode we were looking at\n\n10\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220\ndesigning an editor, an image editor.\n\n11\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.630\nAnd you know we've got the files made but\nwe, now that we've got the created,\n\n12\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.610\nwhat do we do first?\n\n13\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.560\nWhat's the next step?\n\n14\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.860\n&gt;&gt; So we had our initial file setup,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.020\nWe had a design, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.060\nWhat do I want it to look like?\n\n17\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.553\nWell, what do I want it to look like,\n\n18\n00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:51.490\nI should probably have\npulled some customers.\n\n19\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.550\nBut this is more about a learning\nexperience than it is actually something\n\n20\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.480\nthat I would probably deploy.\n\n21\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.741\nSo we're gonna build something\npractically with the HTML 5 canvas,\n\n22\n00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.906\nit'll really help cement what we're doing.\n\n23\n00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:06.959\nNow, in this episode, probably most of our\ntime is going to be on the HTML layout,\n\n24\n00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.723\nand, well, we'll see how much time that\ntakes and see whether Zach's gonna\n\n25\n00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:15.830\ngive it his nod of approval\nbefore we do anything else there.\n\n26\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.118\nSo I think, probably, Zach,\nif I'm not mistaken, we should\n\n27\n00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:21.711\nprobably go ahead and get started\n&gt;&gt; We'll be looking at\n\n28\n00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.870\nthe interface, right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.660\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna create the layout,\nand we'll be good to go.\n\n31\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.420\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.040\ntake a look at my computer here, and,\nwell, this is all we have right now.\n\n33\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.270\nThat is a horrible image editor.\n\n34\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.600\nLet's move that over and,\nwell, that's what we have.\n\n35\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.420\nBut let's start with our HTML layout.\n\n36\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.185\nAnd I'm gonna apparently\nopen the Settings file.\n\n37\n00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:46.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Close this off to the side and\n\n38\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.960\nhere's what I'm thinking.\n\n39\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.170\nBased on our design,\n\n40\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.990\nwe need a, kind of a top level-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n41\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.020\n&gt;&gt; For our controls.\n\n42\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.720\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n43\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.730\nthen we need a bottom section for\nour canvas.\n\n44\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.450\nSo I think I'm going to go about\nkind of doing that, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.620\nSo I'm gonna say &lt;section&gt; and\nI actually need two of these.\n\n46\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.230\nNow just a CMD+Shift D to\nget these two sections.\n\n47\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.244\nThis first section,\nI think I'm gonna call that the menu.\n\n48\n00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:17.020\nBut it's not strictly a menu but\nI think it'll be all right.\n\n49\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.610\nAnd then this other section is going\nto be maybe Into the canvas section or\n\n50\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.780\nthe drawing session or maybe even the\nimage section, we may not need that, but\n\n51\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.870\nI'm gonna use these semantically, we'll\ncomeback and tweet that as necessary.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.490\nSo let's start with the bottom section\ncuz this is actually pretty easy\n\n53\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.300\nto get implemented.\n\n54\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.870\nI'm gonna say canvas.\n\n55\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.730\nAnd within this canvas, I'm gonna give it\n\n56\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.050\na class of image-area just like so and\n\n57\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.184\nthen a width of 800 and a height of 500.\n\n58\n00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:00.930\nAnd that's just for\nsome aspect ratios there.\n\n59\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.590\nWe could probably make this\na variety of things, but\n\n60\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.775\nwe're gonna leave it at 800 by 500.\n\n61\n00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:06.900\nWe could do 800 by 600.\n\n62\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.980\nYou know, 400 x 300, all kinds of stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.790\nBut we're gonna go with that for now.\n\n64\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.010\nSo that's kind of our bottom section, and\n\n65\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.070\nif we look at our menu now,\nour menu gets a little more complicated.\n\n66\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.270\nWe need a set of controls,\n\n67\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.748\nand I'm thinking I want those\nat least In a list of some sort.\n\n68\n00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:31.400\nSo I'm gonna say,\nunordered list with the class of controls,\n\n69\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.090\nis like so, and then we have our list\narea, and I'm gonna say input of type\n\n70\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.930\nfile, and I maybe more specific,\nbecause I'm using it and plugging there.\n\n71\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.380\nSo I'm gonna say input and hit Enter and\nthen I'm gonna say file and\n\n72\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.140\nthen remove these respective\nthings just like so.\n\n73\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.520\nSo, there's that input of type file and\nthen that'll be good.\n\n74\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.965\nLet's get that li over there.\n\n75\n00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:01.010\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; Just quick question.\n\n76\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.880\nSo why are we using\nan input of type=\"file\"?\n\n77\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.078\nWhy don't we just use a button?\n\n78\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:10.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, so\nlet's think back to the previous episode.\n\n79\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.920\nWhat I want is to open a dialog box,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.050\nI wanna click and\n\n81\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.550\nthen select a file from a dialog box like\nwe did from Chrome from the first episode.\n\n82\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.000\nIn order to easily get that using the\ninput of type=\"file\" will do exactly that.\n\n83\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.298\nAnd actually maybe I should\njust show you what I mean.\n\n84\n00:04:27.298 --> 00:04:31.300\nOkay, so if I save this and\nI come over here and refresh.\n\n85\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.250\nIt's kind of small so\nlet me zoom into the console.\n\n86\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.960\nSo if I bring here,\nnotice it says Choose File.\n\n87\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.410\nAnd if we choose File, it will\nautomatically open a dialog box for\n\n88\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.360\nus to go find the file.\n\n89\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.250\nNow that is handy because now we're just\ngonna kind of leverage this file based\n\n90\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.800\nAPI and actually obtaining\nfiles from the local system.\n\n91\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.730\nAnd you may have used something\nlike this in web forms where\n\n92\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.990\nyou're uploading something, right?\n\n93\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.750\nI'm uploading a resume, I'm uploading\na CV, I'm uploading an image.\n\n94\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.700\nWell, we're gonna do that\nlocally in the browser.\n\n95\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.770\nWe're not actually gonna persist\nthis anywhere on the server.\n\n96\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.510\nBut that allows us kinda the easiest\nway to get this dialog box.\n\n97\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.680\nNot to say that you can't\ndo that with JavaScript.\n\n98\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.512\nBut why fight against something\nthat's already available to you?\n\n99\n00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:20.072\nSo that, we kinda get a button for\n\n100\n00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:24.195\nfree without actually\nclaiming that it's a button.\n\n101\n00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:27.852\nIt's a very specific button that opens\nthe dialogue box that allows you to select\n\n102\n00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:30.560\na file, and then that way\nbrought into the browser itself.\n\n103\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.120\nSo that's why we're using\nthat input of type file.\n\n104\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Thank you.\n\n105\n00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.135\n&gt;&gt; So no problem, no problem.\n\n106\n00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:40.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here, I'm thinking, well,\n\n107\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.730\nI need another list item and\nI'm gonna have a button there.\n\n108\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.690\nAnd that button's gonna\nhave a class of apply.\n\n109\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.590\nAnd that's because this is gonna\nbe our application of the filter.\n\n110\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.580\nSo I'm just gonna say apply, and then,\n\n111\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.760\nright near that button, because I\nwanna kinda group these together.\n\n112\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.220\nI'm gonna create the select object, and\nthe select object, I don't wanna name but\n\n113\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.240\nI do want maybe a class of filters, right?\n\n114\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.280\nThis is because this is gonna\nbe our selection of filters.\n\n115\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.200\nAnd within that I need options.\n\n116\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.780\nI need an option and what is this option?\n\n117\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.360\nI'm gonna say none and this value is gonna\nbe important whenever we use this for\n\n118\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.860\ndecision making processes.\n\n119\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.741\nSo I'm gonna say no Filter, and\nlikewise I'm gonna say option.\n\n120\n00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:41.240\nAnd here let's say grayscale,\nand we'll just say Grayscale.\n\n121\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.490\nAnd then likewise we'll go here, and\nI'm not super committed on these filters.\n\n122\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.180\nWe may have to back up,\nbecause these things can get complicated.\n\n123\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.065\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're very math intensive and\nwe'll say Sepia or sepia, is it sepia or\n\n124\n00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:00.710\nsepia.\n\n125\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.620\n&gt;&gt; Sepia.\n\n126\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.290\n&gt;&gt; Well we'll go with\nZack's sepia thank you.\n\n127\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.650\nSepia, very interesting word.\n\n128\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.372\n&gt;&gt; I couLd be wrong though.\n\n129\n00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.880\n&gt;&gt; You said that with such conviction!\n\n131\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.370\nI was gonna change the way,\nthen I'm gonna say sepia based on,\n\n132\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.680\nyour like it's sepia tones.\n\n133\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.700\n&gt;&gt; Sepia, yes, it's sepia.\n\n134\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.710\n&gt;&gt; So well that was a nice\nlittle digression there.\n\n135\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.260\nBack into these options.\n\n136\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.350\nAnd I think this final one maybe just\na brighten and that's to help you see\n\n137\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.845\nif I can brighten,\nI wonder if I can darken, right.\n\n138\n00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:34.250\nIf I can, this grey scale and sepia,\n\n139\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.130\nthose are actually modifying the relative\nmagnitudes of color channels.\n\n140\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.610\nI think, I know grayscale for fact is.\n\n141\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.195\nBut then sepia,\nwe'll have to do some research on that.\n\n142\n00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:51.600\nBut then brighten, well I'm just kinda\nbrightening things when I'm not darkening.\n\n143\n00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.480\nWhat about there's things like Sobel\nfilters and contrasts and colorize.\n\n144\n00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.806\nAnd all the things you can see in\na standard kind of drop-down filter.\n\n145\n00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:06.630\nThey're called something out like\nblurring modes or blending modes.\n\n146\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.440\nWe could technically implement those but\nwe'll start here.\n\n147\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.450\nAnd, well, this will provide expansion\ninto something that you may want to\n\n148\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.050\ninteract with.\n\n149\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.780\n&gt;&gt; So it'll be even plaid.\n\n150\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.320\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n151\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.670\n&gt;&gt; We're not doing plaid.\n\n152\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.560\nThis guy's all about pandas,\nducks, and plaid.\n\n153\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.950\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna stay away from plaid.\n\n154\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.980\n&gt;&gt; I don't think plaid would\nbe that complicated, but\n\n155\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.080\nthen we wouldn't really have an image.\n\n156\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta be.\n\n157\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.936\nIt would just be plaid.\n\n158\n00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:30.877\n&gt;&gt; Would it be?\n\n159\n00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:32.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n160\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.130\nthere's our second button right, and\nit's going to apply the filter and\n\n161\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.540\nthen we have this association in this list\nitem that says hey these two are related.\n\n162\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.147\nWhen you click this button it's\ngoing to grab this filter in, and\n\n163\n00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:48.083\nthat's something that I think will\nbe helpful to the user whenever they\n\n164\n00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:51.450\nare using this image editor right,\nand then.\n\n165\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.286\nI'm thinking maybe we need another\n\n166\n00:08:56.286 --> 00:09:00.580\nbutton for the save, right?\n\n167\n00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.840\nIt has a class of save, just like so.\n\n168\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.580\nSo there's our buttons,\nthere's our very simple layout.\n\n169\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.910\nLet's go see what it looks like now.\n\n170\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:16.850\nGranted, mine's a little zoomed in,\nso it may be a little distorted.\n\n171\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.500\nBut that's just so you can see.\n\n172\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.750\nAnd so here's what I'm thinking.\n\n173\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.560\nWe have this section, we have the canvas.\n\n174\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n175\n00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Right, even though we can't see it,\ncuz everything's white.\n\n176\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.090\nBut we would choose a file, and let's\njust, let's say this is an image file.\n\n177\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.730\nAnd then that would show up in the canvas.\n\n178\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.670\nAnd then when we would click like sepia\napply, that would make it sepia tone or\n\n179\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.900\nsepia tone and\nthen we would click save and\n\n180\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.240\nthen that would give us the changed image.\n\n181\n00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.202\nSo I think there's all out buttons and,\nyou know what, Zach?\n\n182\n00:09:50.202 --> 00:09:54.300\nThe interface layout is done, and well,\n\n183\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.960\nI'm pretty proud of it myself\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n184\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.390\nI know in previous episodes you\ncreated the canvas so dynamically.\n\n185\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.990\nIt's been dynamic.\n\n186\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.950\nIt was a dynamic.\n\n187\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.440\nBut this seems to be\na little bit more static.\n\n188\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.780\nWhy is that?\nIs there a reason for that, or?\n\n189\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.150\n&gt;&gt; So.\n&gt;&gt; Or, can we make it dynamic?\n\n190\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.180\n&gt;&gt; I think just to keep things a little\nsimple, because most of our focus\n\n191\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.400\nis gonna be the interactions of the\nbuttons in order to manipulate the canvas,\n\n192\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.830\neither putting in an object, putting in\na file or exporting a file through a save.\n\n193\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.560\nI want to focus on that,\n\n194\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.330\nas well as creating the filters,\nkind of in this module, right.\n\n195\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.550\nI wanna make it grayscale,\nI wanna make it sepia tone.\n\n196\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.190\nI don't want to dynamically resize\nthe canvas, at least initially.\n\n197\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nwe can go back to it to reduce it.\n\n198\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\nright now I'm gonna keep it fairly static\n\n199\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.320\njust to remove a concern\nfrom our application.\n\n200\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n201\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.680\nSo let's move forward.\n\n202\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.910\nMacduff.\n\n203\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, I'm not sure if\nthere's much more to move forward.\n\n204\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.980\nDoes this look all right to you?\n\n205\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.050\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of functional.\n\n206\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.315\nCan we pretty it up a bit?\n\n207\n00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:55.175\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say that,\nso yeah,\n\n208\n00:10:55.175 --> 00:10:56.955\nwe should probably make\nit a little prettier.\n\n209\n00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:01.875\nSo luckily, I have some classes\nthat I can use to style.\n\n210\n00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:08.477\nNow, I am by no means the beautification\nexpert when it comes to web development.\n\n211\n00:11:08.477 --> 00:11:09.847\nBut there are a few things that we can do.\n\n212\n00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:14.797\nNumber one, being able to see\nthe canvas is probably good.\n\n213\n00:11:14.797 --> 00:11:18.297\nHaving these controls not\nnecessarily in the bulleted list,\n\n214\n00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:20.837\nthat's probably a good thing as well.\n\n215\n00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:23.501\nSo we need to write a little bit of CSS.\n\n216\n00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:25.112\nAnd everybody does enjoy it,\n\n217\n00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:28.680\nI've tried to minimize how much\nCSS that we need to write, but.\n\n218\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, right,\nyou said that from the onset.\n\n219\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, so body,\n\n220\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.000\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove\nall the margins from the body.\n\n221\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.810\nAnd let's go ahead and\nmake the background color for the body,\n\n222\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.480\nlet's just make it black.\n\n223\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd the reason being is,\nwell you'll see it'll help the canvas pop.\n\n224\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.500\nI tend to be a dark screen,\ndark theme individual,\n\n225\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.760\nthis could be an additional feature that\nwe could add later, like theming for\n\n226\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.800\nyour interface, but right now, no.\n\n227\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.420\nSo there's our HTML and body,\n\n228\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.910\nI've just removed margin and\nit helps reset a few things now.\n\n229\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.121\nNow, and realistically,\nI would probably reset,\n\n230\n00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:13.470\nuse a CSS reset or something like that But\nfor now, we're just gonna deal with that.\n\n231\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.650\nNow if we look,\nthere's this menu section, right?\n\n232\n00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.813\nWell, I want that to make sure,\nif we come here and we look,\n\n233\n00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:31.600\nthere's our HTML and\nI can't even really see the menu section.\n\n234\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.030\nLet's go to the elements portion.\n\n235\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.280\nI come down here and there we go,\n\n236\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.030\nI wanna make sure that it's the full\nwidth, I always wanna make sure.\n\n237\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.880\nSo I'm gonna set that on the menu class.\n\n238\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.290\nSo for the menu,\nI want the width to be 100%,\n\n239\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.570\nessentially the entire\nview width of the window.\n\n240\n00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.180\n&gt;&gt; And then likewise for controls,\n\n242\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.870\nI am gonna change that a little bit\nbecause they cannot just blend in for now.\n\n243\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.060\nNow what is controls?\n\n244\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.060\nThe controls are the unordered list here.\n\n245\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.260\nSo this unordered list is going\nto be the set of controls.\n\n246\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.800\nIn order to do that,\nbackground color gray.\n\n247\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.960\nThere we go.\n\n248\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.100\nAnd then I'm gonna give\nit a height of 50 pixels.\n\n249\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.050\nNow, this is not necessarily\ngoing to be super-responsive.\n\n250\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.470\nBut I don't feel like this is something\nthat I would do on a mobile device anyway.\n\n251\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.020\nIt would typically be on like a laptop or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n252\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.954\n&gt;&gt; So that's not our ultimate goal, and\n\n253\n00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:34.810\nthen I am going to use a flexbox\ndisplay type so I can get all those\n\n254\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.684\nbuttons kind of spread out equally\nalong the width of the page.\n\n255\n00:13:39.684 --> 00:13:44.176\nSo space around and there we go and\n\n256\n00:13:44.176 --> 00:13:47.710\nthat's not bad, right?\n\n257\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.310\nYou're like, well, that's not great.\n\n258\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.150\nBut if I remove it,\nthey've kind of equally spaced.\n\n259\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:58.240\nNow the one thing is they\nstill have those dots, right?\n\n260\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.540\nRemoving those would be nice,\nit's still a bulleted list.\n\n261\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.960\nSo if we look for controls, and\n\n262\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.540\nwe say list style;none and\nlet me make a padding of about 28 pixels.\n\n263\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:19.370\nAnd a margin of auto and 30 pixels on it,\n\n264\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:24.720\nit gives us a little bit of spacing, moves\nthings around, so if we look at that.\n\n265\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.490\nThat's a little better,\nit's kinda more what I was thinking.\n\n266\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.180\nSo this is more like a menu bar.\n\n267\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.310\nAnd then finally, well,\n\n268\n00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:41.670\nI'm thinking if we come here and\nwe look, there's our section,\n\n269\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.612\nand, I think the body,\n\n270\n00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:51.670\nlet's wrap this entire thing in a main or\nlike an app div.\n\n271\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.340\nSo this is not gonna change our layout at\n\n272\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:01.010\nall necessarily from\na non-stop perspective.\n\n273\n00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.360\nAnd I'm gonna wrap this\nentire thing like so and\n\n274\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.610\nnow we have that app div with an id.\n\n275\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:13.260\nAnd I'm just gonna say, I may come\nback and use that in just a moment,\n\n276\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.720\nactually I am very sorry,\nI'm misreading my notes.\n\n277\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.990\nShenanigans.\n\n278\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.145\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I want.\n\n279\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.658\nI think this section would\nprobably be best as,\n\n280\n00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:30.750\nlike our main image editor.\n\n281\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.430\nRight, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:39.100\nSo, main, let's just say the canvas area.\n\n283\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.390\nOr let's call this the display area.\n\n284\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.400\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.520\nSo now in our main.CSS for the display,\n\n286\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.930\nI want to change this display\nto flexbox as well and\n\n287\n00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.530\njustify content space around and\n\n288\n00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:04.520\nwhat that will do is now that a canvas\nwill be kind of right in the center.\n\n289\n00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:10.197\nAnd then for the actual image area, Well,\n\n290\n00:16:10.197 --> 00:16:14.670\nlet's give it a, I don't think we actually\nneed a board since everything's black.\n\n291\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.800\nLet's give it a background color Of white,\njust like so.\n\n292\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.500\nSo boom, and now there we go.\n\n293\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.220\n&gt;&gt; We actually have our image editor\nsection, our control section.\n\n294\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.520\nAnd let me double check\none thing because yep,\n\n295\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.270\nnotice that butt's right up against that.\n\n296\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.370\nIf we wanted to change that,\nthis display area,\n\n297\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.020\nmaybe a little bit of\nmargin-top about 30 pixels.\n\n298\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.750\nSo it's more of a frame, there we go.\n\n299\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We kind of pushed it down a little bit.\n\n300\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.700\nNow we'll have to tweak that.\n\n301\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.910\nMaybe we just give it very small amounts,\nso\n\n302\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.150\nthat we don't have to scroll up and\ndown per say.\n\n303\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:17:00.420\nSo we got that little break, we have\nour delineation between the actual area\n\n304\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.690\nthat is controls and the display area,\nwhich is where our image is gonna be.\n\n305\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.750\nNow notice this is very large\nbecause number one I'm zoomed in.\n\n306\n00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:15.320\n&gt;&gt; But if I zoom out, right,\nthat's what we're gonna see.\n\n308\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.800\nWe're gonna see a tiny little area and\na little bit like apply,\n\n309\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.830\nhere's our filter, grey scale,\nthen I would apply.\n\n310\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.300\nAnd then that would change\non this white portion.\n\n311\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.810\nBut I'm gonna keep this zoomed in just for\nseeing things.\n\n312\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.450\nBased on what I see from the original\nzoom, I would probably turn up\n\n313\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.170\nthat sizing a little bit on my screen, but\nthis is gonna be very screen dependent.\n\n314\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.110\nI have a high resolution display.\n\n315\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.250\nSo the 800 by 500 may be\neven more applicable to you,\n\n316\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.100\nyou'll have to play with that.\n\n317\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.720\nBut I didn't say, I told you,\nI was not the king of beautification.\n\n318\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.800\nHowever, however, I think this is\n&gt;&gt; A first approximation.\n\n319\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.720\nIt does give us some hints,\n\n320\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.860\nsome cues, here's some controls,\nhere's our main editor area.\n\n321\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.870\nCuz our real focus is reading the filters,\ncreating the ability to upload the image.\n\n322\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.250\nUpload is not a true upload per se.\n\n323\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.455\nOpening the browser, using this controls.\n\n324\n00:18:11.455 --> 00:18:13.210\nModify as well as downloaded.\n\n325\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.280\nAnd that's where my focus is gonna be.\n\n326\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.980\nBecause those are the parts that\ninvolve an actual canvas element.\n\n327\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.670\nBut at least this is\na first approximation.\n\n328\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.980\nNot really sold on that grain,\nbut we'll go with it anyway.\n\n329\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.290\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, will we have a part\ntwo of setting up the interface?\n\n330\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.517\n&gt;&gt; No, I think this is a good\nfirst step because like I said,\n\n331\n00:18:33.517 --> 00:18:39.438\nmost of the real dense material is gonna\nbecome, how do I get the image in there?\n\n332\n00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:41.279\nHow do I modify the image?\n\n333\n00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:44.442\nHow do I undo\nthe modification of an image?\n\n334\n00:18:44.442 --> 00:18:45.008\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n335\n00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:45.840\n&gt;&gt; How do I save the image?\n\n336\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.880\nSo that's where things are gonna get\na little hectic so definitely stay tuned.\n\n337\n00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.638\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd thank you for\n\n338\n00:18:50.638 --> 00:18:52.120\nwatching this episode of\nSetting up the Interface.\n\n339\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.440\nIn fact maybe in subsequent episodes we\nmight put a baby duck image in there, or\n\n340\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.400\nwho knows?\n\n341\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.630\nSo then [LAUGH] by the way make sure you\nwatch all of the HTML5 Canvas Projects\n\n342\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.590\nepisodes.\n\n343\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.370\nJustin does an amazing job, and while\nyou're at it, go to our course library and\n\n344\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.290\ntake a look at any of the hundreds\nof videos there all designed\n\n345\n00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.840\nto help you go further.\n\n346\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.680\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n347\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.400\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n348\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.130\n&gt;&gt;

It is good to see you as well, Zack.\n\n8\n00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.492\nI'm happy to be back in the studios.\n\n9\n00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:35.554\nAnd how are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:38.474\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm excited, I would like to\nfind out a couple of things though.\n\n11\n00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.642\nWe're building the image editor, right?\n\n12\n00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.668\nSo that doesn't really mean anything\nunless we can get an image on the page,\n\n13\n00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.343\nand is that where we're going right now?\n\n14\n00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:47.841\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly where we're\ngoing at this moment, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:48.835\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n16\n00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.418\n&gt;&gt; Until we get an image on the canvas,\nyou can't really manipulate an image or\n\n17\n00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.771\nsave an image,\nlike nothing will works, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.074\nSo that's our first kind of priority.\n\n19\n00:00:57.074 --> 00:01:00.830\nNow, this is one of those topics\nwhere in my mind I'm like\n\n20\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.944\nthis is pretty straightforward.\n\n21\n00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:09.254\nBut I'm gonna hold my reservations until\nwe actually get to that point, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:12.975\nSo I think probably the best thing\nto do is just start trying things,\n\n23\n00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.131\nbecause we have to learn a few\nAPIs inside of the browser.\n\n24\n00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.210\nIf you're unfamiliar with them,\n\n25\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.307\nas well as reading in images which are\neverything's kind of asynchronous, right?\n\n26\n00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:26.484\nAnd like a reading file and\nreading an image and reading,\n\n27\n00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:28.745\nthere's all kinds of asynchronicity.\n\n28\n00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:32.833\nWhich means that we have call backs and\ncall backs and call backs, or\n\n29\n00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.561\na plethora of other things.\n\n30\n00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.760\nAnd maybe we won't have to clean that up,\nso\n\n31\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.204\nI think this should be\nfairly straight forward.\n\n32\n00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:44.804\nBut there are always times where I am\na horrible planner of time, so to speak.\n\n33\n00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.610\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen, and see where we left off,\n\n34\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.235\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n35\n00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:49.685\n&gt;&gt; And what we're ultimately gonna do.\n\n36\n00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:51.623\nI have this kind of moved in a little bit,\n\n37\n00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:55.054\nbecause I am gonna use the terminal\njust to kind of display some things.\n\n38\n00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:58.840\nAnd if I click Choose File, there it is.\n\n39\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.003\nThis is all of our files.\n\n40\n00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.491\nNow, since the previous episode,\nI've added an images folder.\n\n41\n00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:08.379\nNow, you just add the images folder and\nadd an image that you want to,\n\n42\n00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.202\nI have used the ITPro.TV logo,\nthat's a pretty good start there.\n\n43\n00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:16.952\nSo there's our logo, so\nthat's where our images are.\n\n44\n00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:21.740\nNow, that means that we have\nto do some JavaScript stuff.\n\n45\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.826\nNow before we can get to\nthe JavaScript stuff for the images,\n\n46\n00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:29.142\nwe should probably set up some\ncontrols and things of that nature.\n\n47\n00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:33.510\nNow I typically put these in an object\nto avoid polluting the global namespace.\n\n48\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.083\nYou know what?\n\n49\n00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:37.173\nI think this is one of those\nprojects where we're learning.\n\n50\n00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.250\nLet's just dive in and get it done,\n\n51\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.774\nand then we can always kinda move things\naround at a later date if we so desire.\n\n52\n00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:51.203\nSo let's create a couple of\nreferences to this control.\n\n53\n00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:57.152\nThis control, and then this control\nas well as the canvas, right?\n\n54\n00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:04.255\nSo let's see, the canvas,\nthe canvas is document.query selector.\n\n55\n00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.036\nYou got to spell document correctly,\ndocument.query.\n\n56\n00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:10.742\nAnd I'm gonna have to open up that\nindex.html, mainly because some of\n\n57\n00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:14.661\nthose classes, it's just gonna be easier\nto flip back in and look at them.\n\n58\n00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:20.303\nSo document.querySelector, and\nwe wanna grab the actual canvas element.\n\n59\n00:03:20.303 --> 00:03:24.003\nIf we come over to index.html,\nwell here's our image area.\n\n60\n00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:29.222\nSo I need to grab the thing\nwith the class of image area.\n\n61\n00:03:29.222 --> 00:03:33.857\nAnd now let's go ahead and\nset up our context and ctx,\n\n62\n00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:40.461\njust to keep with convention that I've\nbeen using pretty much all the time.\n\n63\n00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:45.193\nSo there's our 2D context,\nso there's our work area.\n\n64\n00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:51.313\nOur work space so to speak,\nand now we need our controls.\n\n65\n00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:54.142\nAnd let's see, what do we need?\n\n66\n00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:56.394\nWell we need an open, right?\n\n67\n00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.457\nKind of our open control.\n\n68\n00:03:58.457 --> 00:04:02.103\nSo that's document.querySelector.\n\n69\n00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:07.513\nAnd well what class is that or what ID?\n\n70\n00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:12.503\nIf we come up here, it's a input of file,\nI don't actually have a class on this.\n\n71\n00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:16.983\nSo we should probably put a class on\nthat just number one possibly for\n\n72\n00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:21.314\nlater styling, but\nalso to give us some context, some.\n\n73\n00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:24.818\nNow you could use an ID,\nI tend to use classes.\n\n74\n00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.564\nI'm not saying that's\nnecessarily the best way, but\n\n75\n00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:29.603\nwhat if you had a bunch of opens, right?\n\n76\n00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.292\nThen you can install a bunch\nof them instead of just one.\n\n77\n00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:33.594\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n78\n00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:36.043\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna add the class of open there,\n\n79\n00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:39.992\nand that means that I'm gonna\ncome back over here and say open.\n\n80\n00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:43.448\nAnd likewise I want the save, and\n\n81\n00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:48.643\nthat's document.querySelector, selector.\n\n82\n00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:54.411\nAnd that's the save class,\nand then we need this\n\n83\n00:04:54.411 --> 00:05:00.047\napply button, so\nwe need the ability to apply.\n\n84\n00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:03.763\nApply = document.querySelector, and\n\n85\n00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:08.440\nthat's apply, and\nthen likewise we need filters.\n\n86\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.836\nNow this one's kinda tricky\nbecause do we want filters,\n\n87\n00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:18.803\ndo we want all the filters, all the\noptions or we just want the filter select?\n\n88\n00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:22.363\nWell we're gonna go with the select now.\n\n89\n00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:24.512\n&gt;&gt; But that could change.\n\n90\n00:05:24.512 --> 00:05:27.404\n&gt;&gt; We'll see if that\nworks out in our favor,\n\n91\n00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:30.473\nso here's our query selector for filters.\n\n92\n00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:32.865\nAnd even though this is plural,\n\n93\n00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:37.833\nthis lets me that this is possibly\na multi kinda children element.\n\n94\n00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:42.484\nThis is a convention that I use that helps\nme think about this in context, right?\n\n95\n00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:43.902\nSo there's all our controls.\n\n96\n00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:48.133\nNow, here's my recommendation\nbefore going any further.\n\n97\n00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:53.923\nWe should probably just print these out\nand make sure none of them are null.\n\n98\n00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:56.520\nMaybe we have a typo in the string for\nthe selection.\n\n99\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.546\nAnd if they are null,\n\n100\n00:05:57.546 --> 00:06:00.522\nthen we are gonna have to chase\ndown that error at a later date.\n\n101\n00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:03.181\nSo if we come over here, and we refresh,\n\n102\n00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:08.054\nthere's our canvas element,\nthere's our rendering context, right?\n\n103\n00:06:08.054 --> 00:06:09.013\nThere it is.\n\n104\n00:06:09.013 --> 00:06:12.992\nAnd then here's our input for\nOpen, Save, Apply, and Filters.\n\n105\n00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:16.130\nAnd we're all good to go, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.483\nSo we have kind of our basic set up.\n\n107\n00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:22.435\nNow let me think about what\nis the next course of action?\n\n108\n00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:27.512\nIf I came to this page as a user\nI would click Choose File.\n\n109\n00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:32.491\nAnd I would choose the image\nthat I wanted to modify, right?\n\n110\n00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:36.742\nAnd notice that it changed when I choose,\n\n111\n00:06:36.742 --> 00:06:38.690\nchoose that file-\n\n112\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n113\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.750\nSo this change.\n\n114\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.263\nNow that's a key word,\n\n115\n00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:45.362\nbecause you are very tempted to\nhave a click event here, right?\n\n116\n00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:49.090\nI clicked on something, however\nthe element changed because it became\n\n117\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.401\nassociated with a file\non your file system.\n\n118\n00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:55.315\nA change event is also an event,\nwith that said,\n\n119\n00:06:55.315 --> 00:07:01.247\nthen we can probably listen to a change\nevent as see what happens, right?\n\n120\n00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:05.801\nSo we're gonna come back over here and\nsadly this is one of those things,\n\n121\n00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:10.147\nbecause I'm not gonna hard code\nan image to test this out, I can't.\n\n122\n00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:12.283\nI don't know why I actually\nwant to see that interaction.\n\n123\n00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:16.977\nYou're always gonna see me open, select a\nfile, that's just how things are gonna go.\n\n124\n00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:20.278\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I want to add and EventListener, so\n\n125\n00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:23.991\nhere's our events that\nwe're gonna listen to.\n\n126\n00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.971\nLet's add some overscroll down here.\n\n127\n00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.551\nThere we go.\n\n128\n00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:34.712\nAdd an EventListener to the change event,\njust like so.\n\n129\n00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:37.361\nAnd I'm just gonna use\na fat arrow function.\n\n130\n00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:40.708\nNow do keep in mind, I wanna reiterate,\nthese fat arrow functions,\n\n131\n00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:43.551\nthey work very well in Chrome and\nnew versions of Firefox.\n\n132\n00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.557\nActually I think Safari, but\n\n133\n00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:50.140\ndo keep in mind they're still in\nflux at the time of this recording.\n\n134\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.428\nWhat I like to do when I\nfirst get a change event or\n\n135\n00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:56.895\nany type of event is this\nlook at the event, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:56.895 --> 00:08:00.291\nSo I'm gonna console.log the event, And\n\n137\n00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.733\nthen I'm going to refresh,\ndon't forget to refresh.\n\n138\n00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:11.302\nI'm gonna select the exact same image,\nOpen and boom, there's our event.\n\n139\n00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:17.212\nSo it is a change event, it's target\nwas input.open, that's what we expect.\n\n140\n00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:20.147\nAnd if we scroll down here and\nwe keep looking,\n\n141\n00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:23.174\ndoesn't look like\nanything's gonna help us.\n\n142\n00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:29.222\nBut if we come in and\nwe look inside of target.\n\n143\n00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:32.821\nWell there's files.\n\n144\n00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:38.521\nHey, files, files,\nit seems like that might be what we want,\n\n145\n00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:40.681\ncuz I just added a file.\n\n146\n00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:47.701\nJust to see, I wonder if I look inside\nof that target object, the input.open.\n\n147\n00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:54.913\nIf there's files by default, so\nlet's refresh and go open.files.\n\n148\n00:08:54.913 --> 00:08:57.951\nAnd it is there, but it says nothing.\n\n149\n00:08:57.951 --> 00:09:02.894\nOkay, okay, that means that when we\nadded that file, the event changed,\n\n150\n00:09:02.894 --> 00:09:07.600\nit said hey, it's something about\nthis input file type has changed.\n\n151\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.500\nIt is now has a file in the file list.\n\n152\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.453\nThat is done for you,\nwe don't have to do that in JavaScript.\n\n153\n00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:16.433\nWe do have to recognize that,\nthat happens and handle it via JavaScript.\n\n154\n00:09:16.433 --> 00:09:20.384\nSo with that said, let's grab those files.\n\n155\n00:09:20.384 --> 00:09:26.873\nSo this is files and\nthat was e.target, just like so.\n\n156\n00:09:26.873 --> 00:09:31.113\nNow I'm using the event target,\njust so I can be very specific.\n\n157\n00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.103\nI could technically use open here.\n\n158\n00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:39.133\nI just typed in open.files, but\ne.target is the open element, right?\n\n159\n00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:44.757\nSo there's files, and let's look at\nconsole.log files, just like so.\n\n160\n00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:50.960\nSo if I refresh and boom,\nselect it again and I Open.\n\n161\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.844\nThere it is, there's our file and\nit has a name and a last modified date.\n\n162\n00:09:56.844 --> 00:10:02.078\nAnd a webkitRelativePath, a size,\nit tells me a little bit about the file.\n\n163\n00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:04.958\nAnd you're like well, I have it.\n\n164\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:05.607\nNot really.\n\n165\n00:10:05.607 --> 00:10:06.258\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n166\n00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:14.083\nYou actually have to read in the file in\norder to get things kind of working, okay?\n\n167\n00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:17.023\nSo what does that mean?\n\n168\n00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:23.685\nWell part of the browser API,\nis there's this file reader API.\n\n169\n00:10:23.685 --> 00:10:27.299\nSo new FileReader, and\n\n170\n00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:31.462\nI wanna say reader.read.\n\n171\n00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:35.184\nI have to consult my book here.\n\n172\n00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:39.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; readAsDataUrl, and\n\n173\n00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:44.593\nthis is going to allow\nus to read in a file.\n\n174\n00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:47.866\nBut this is asynchronous, so\nany type of IO network or\n\n175\n00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:51.016\nread write operation is\ngoing to be asynchronous.\n\n176\n00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:53.554\nSo this is not gonna happen immediately,\n\n177\n00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:56.971\nit's not like I'm gonna get\na new thing back right now.\n\n178\n00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:02.342\nWhat I want to do is read files,\nand then this one, okay?\n\n179\n00:11:02.342 --> 00:11:03.920\nSo there we go.\n\n180\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:12.002\nAnd if we look, so\nconsole.log reader, and refresh.\n\n181\n00:11:12.002 --> 00:11:15.223\nAnd check it out, there we are.\n\n182\n00:11:15.223 --> 00:11:18.620\nSo boom, and is not a function.\n\n183\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.963\nRead as they all, I misspelled URL.\n\n184\n00:11:20.963 --> 00:11:25.838\nSo URL in this case is typically\nall capital letters, woopsy daisy.\n\n185\n00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:26.461\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n186\n00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:30.481\n&gt;&gt; Now the complexity of this, there will\nprobably be some live action debugging.\n\n187\n00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:32.143\nAnd I know how much you love that Zach.\n\n188\n00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:33.812\n&gt;&gt; I do, I love debug.\n\n189\n00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:38.692\n&gt;&gt; If we come here and we look,\nthe ready state is two result.\n\n190\n00:11:38.692 --> 00:11:42.240\nOkay, well it's there now, but\nis it guaranteed to be there?\n\n191\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.392\nWhat if this file was really large?\n\n192\n00:11:43.392 --> 00:11:47.422\nThis is a small file,\nwhat if this was a 3 megabyte file?\n\n193\n00:11:47.422 --> 00:11:51.362\nIt may not read in fast enough,\nso there's no guarantee that\n\n194\n00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:55.781\nthis console.log that the reader\nhas read in the file as a data url.\n\n195\n00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.742\nNow what do I mean by data url?\n\n196\n00:11:57.742 --> 00:11:59.541\nSee this result right here?\n\n197\n00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:05.834\nThis data URL, it gives us a base\n64 encoding of said image,\n\n198\n00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:13.230\nwhich we can use as kind of an image\nawait to create an image dynamically.\n\n199\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.685\nSo if you put those in as the image\nsource, inside of the browser,\n\n200\n00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:19.469\ndata image png base 64.\n\n201\n00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:23.663\nIt'll actually run through that and\nactually recreate the image,sSo very,\n\n202\n00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:25.070\nvery interesting there.\n\n203\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:30.778\nBut what this means is I have to\nlisten for kind of the read event,\n\n204\n00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:34.491\ninside of this reader, that is not good.\n\n205\n00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:38.964\nSo I'm gonna say reader.,\nI could do addEventListener, just for\n\n206\n00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.091\nconsistency, let's do that.\n\n207\n00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:44.161\nOn load, now we've seen this\nbefore with images, right?\n\n208\n00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:47.551\nIf I'm dynamically setting images sources,\nbut\n\n209\n00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:51.193\nI'm asking someone to give\nme a file that is an image.\n\n210\n00:12:51.193 --> 00:12:55.150\nIt's not necessarily something I'm making\nfrom a web request, cuz the web request\n\n211\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.340\nwould actually read this in and\nkind of hide some of this away for us.\n\n212\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.414\nBut I need to read this into the browser,\n\n213\n00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:02.612\nin order to be able to\nuse it with the image.\n\n214\n00:13:02.612 --> 00:13:08.952\nSo now we have another function,\nanother call back.\n\n215\n00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:12.612\nSo an event listener inside\nan event listener, and\n\n216\n00:13:12.612 --> 00:13:15.540\nthen let's look here at console.log.\n\n217\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.136\nAt this point,\nif we print out the reader again,\n\n218\n00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:22.315\nthis is a small image so it's fairly fast.\n\n219\n00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:27.038\nIf we console.log, we're guaranteed to\nget, notice that's a ready state of two,\n\n220\n00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:29.410\nwe have the result, that's what we want.\n\n221\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.103\nBut at this point,\nwe need to make an image.\n\n222\n00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:42.440\nWell, let's see we have\nimage = new image and\n\n223\n00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.993\nimage.src = reader.result,\n\n224\n00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:51.542\nand then well, I need another add\n\n225\n00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:56.272\nevent listener, just like this.\n\n226\n00:13:56.272 --> 00:14:00.302\nLoad, and what is that?\n\n227\n00:14:00.302 --> 00:14:07.682\nWell if we look and\nconsole.log the image, just like so.\n\n228\n00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:13.843\nThen refresh, I choose,\nI look at the logo .png and I open.\n\n229\n00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:16.772\nThere is our image tag that\nwe could append anywhere.\n\n230\n00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:21.230\nAnd as a matter of fact, I'm gonna append\nit just to show you that it does work.\n\n231\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.325\nSo what I'm gonna do is inside of a,\n\n232\n00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:29.700\nlet's see, this controls portion?\n\n233\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:38.940\nJust for now,\nI will grab the canvas.parent,\n\n234\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.309\nI think I can grab the parent like that,\n\n235\n00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:48.723\nand then appendChild of image.\n\n236\n00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:53.297\nAnd then let's make sure that I can\n\n237\n00:14:53.297 --> 00:14:58.201\ncanvas.parent, parentElement.\n\n238\n00:14:58.201 --> 00:14:58.712\nThere we go.\n\n239\n00:14:58.712 --> 00:15:03.074\nSo there's the parentElement,\nso I need to add Element there.\n\n240\n00:15:03.074 --> 00:15:07.621\nNow if we refresh,\nnotice I can't scroll up or down.\n\n241\n00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:11.232\nWe come here, open the image &gt; Open,\nand there it is.\n\n242\n00:15:11.232 --> 00:15:11.833\nIt actually get's appended.\n\n243\n00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:16.772\nNow it's kind of squished, because of\nlayout and things, but it does read in.\n\n244\n00:15:16.772 --> 00:15:22.704\nAnd that time I have the image\navailable to me, right?\n\n245\n00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:25.213\nThis was a lot of work-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:15:25.213 --> 00:15:26.862\n&gt;&gt; For that on change portion, right?\n\n247\n00:15:26.862 --> 00:15:27.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n248\n00:15:27.363 --> 00:15:30.195\n&gt;&gt; Now Zack,\nI was typing a few of these things, and\n\n249\n00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:34.354\nI saw you kind of looking at me\nquizzically, out of the corner of my eye.\n\n250\n00:15:34.354 --> 00:15:36.059\nDo you have a question?\n\n251\n00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:38.074\n&gt;&gt; Well you were using a 0 or\nan O right, so\n\n252\n00:15:38.074 --> 00:15:41.078\ndoesn't that mean that we can\nmake multiple images or no?\n\n253\n00:15:41.078 --> 00:15:43.238\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nactually that's what that does mean.\n\n254\n00:15:43.238 --> 00:15:47.269\nThis files.0 this file list\ncould be a bunch of files.\n\n255\n00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:50.400\nThe selector can allow you to\nselect a great number of files.\n\n256\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.344\nOur main focus is gonna be on a single\nfile, but you're absolutely correct\n\n257\n00:15:55.344 --> 00:16:00.224\nthat files bracket 0, I just want\nthe first one, and that's a default.\n\n258\n00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:01.674\nI'm not saying that's the best default.\n\n259\n00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:02.242\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n260\n00:16:02.242 --> 00:16:06.822\nthat's kind of what our\napplication is garnered to, okay?\n\n261\n00:16:06.822 --> 00:16:11.432\nNow with this said,\nappending to the canvass,\n\n262\n00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:14.900\nthat's probably not what we want.\n\n263\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.990\nWe actually wanna draw\nit to the canvass right?\n\n264\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Sure, makes sense.\n\n265\n00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.149\n&gt;&gt; We wanna draw it to the canvass.\n\n266\n00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:26.714\nAnd, well, let's see here,\nwe may need it later.\n\n267\n00:16:26.714 --> 00:16:28.194\nWe also may need it later.\n\n268\n00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:33.883\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come up\nhere and add a like a less statements.\n\n269\n00:16:33.883 --> 00:16:37.900\nSo let's look at our\nimage buffer here,okay.\n\n270\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.770\nAnd then we wanna draw to the canvas.\n\n271\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.282\nBut not only that,\nwe want to set the image equal to\n\n272\n00:16:44.282 --> 00:16:48.375\nthe actual thing that's brought in, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:52.287\nSo, hmm.\n\n274\n00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:55.199\nImage?\n\n275\n00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:59.235\nNope, image buffer equals image,\n\n276\n00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:04.347\nas well as ctx.drawImage\nof the image buffer\n\n277\n00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:11.000\njust to make sure that was set equal,\nzero, zero.\n\n278\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.195\nSo, now we have this giant mess\nhere with onloads, onloads,\n\n279\n00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:18.918\non changes,\njust kind of stacked on top of each other.\n\n280\n00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:20.788\nBut if we come back and we wanna refresh,\n\n281\n00:17:20.788 --> 00:17:23.650\nhopefully, we have all of\nthis kind of figured out.\n\n282\n00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.730\nSo here's our logo, .png,\nand open, and well, I guess,\n\n283\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.970\nI could accidentally hit back,\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n284\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.480\nI wanna zoom out because\nI've got this crunched up.\n\n285\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.041\nCheers, here is our logo.png,\nthese are open, and there's our image.\n\n286\n00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:45.759\nIt actually loads that on, and\nif I look here's the image buffer.\n\n287\n00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:46.813\nIt's still that image.\n\n288\n00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:51.384\nSo, this is how we can read from a file,\nfrom an input.\n\n289\n00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:55.801\nThat was a lot of work, Zach, and it looks\nlike you're not necessarily satisfied with\n\n290\n00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:58.054\nthis giant mess of spaghetti shenanigans.\n\n291\n00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:00.349\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was wondering\nwhether to say this or not, but\n\n292\n00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:01.936\nis there any way we can clean this up?\n\n293\n00:18:01.936 --> 00:18:02.779\nDo we have time to do that?\n\n294\n00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:03.609\nI think we do.\n\n295\n00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:04.370\n&gt;&gt; I think we do.\n\n296\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think we do, now.\n\n297\n00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:08.817\nWe're gonna give it the old college try.\n\n298\n00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:10.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; But what I'm gonna do,\n\n299\n00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:14.345\nI'm thinking, what's probably best is,\nI want to change,\n\n300\n00:18:14.345 --> 00:18:17.850\nwe got it working, I want to\nchange how this works little bit.\n\n301\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.739\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I think I wanna create a temporary\n\n302\n00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:24.081\ncanvas element that I'm\ngonna call buffer and\n\n303\n00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:27.779\nthen return that using\nwhat's known as a promise.\n\n304\n00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:30.041\nNow, promises help build asyncrosity.\n\n305\n00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:34.986\nWe can do, do this, then this,\nthen this, and then the resolve works.\n\n306\n00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:41.433\nSo, I'm gonna create a new\nfunction called loadImage.\n\n307\n00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:46.382\nAnd, that image is going to take a file.\n\n308\n00:18:46.382 --> 00:18:51.087\nAnd, actually let's say a filepath.\n\n309\n00:18:51.087 --> 00:18:58.174\nSo files, yeah,\nthat's what I want, filepath.\n\n310\n00:18:58.174 --> 00:19:00.651\nOr better yet, let's call it filename.\n\n311\n00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:03.990\nI always get weird, cuz it's not\nreally a path cuz I put it in the.\n\n312\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.652\nAnyway, so I'm gonna return a new promise.\n\n313\n00:19:07.652 --> 00:19:09.056\nNow, if you're like, what is a promise?\n\n314\n00:19:09.056 --> 00:19:09.821\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n315\n00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:12.684\n&gt;&gt; I definitely covered these\nin our library extensively,\n\n316\n00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.300\ndealing with asynchronisity.\n\n317\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.310\nI like promises because\nthey provide a uniform API,\n\n318\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.640\nand I can encapsulate a lot of this, like,\n\n319\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.190\nweird call back stuff inside of\na promise and kind of hide it away.\n\n320\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.760\nSo that's what I'm gonna do, and typically\npromises take a resolve and a reject.\n\n321\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.590\nThe only way that this would ever\nreject is if something bad happened.\n\n322\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.950\nSo for this one,\nI'm not going to have a reject, but\n\n323\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.520\nin general,\npromises have a resolve or reject.\n\n324\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.724\nAnd you can say if I resolve,\nhere's the data you ask for, if I reject,\n\n325\n00:19:45.724 --> 00:19:47.140\nsomething went wrong.\n\n326\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.327\nNow at that point, what I want is I wanna\n\n327\n00:19:52.327 --> 00:19:57.211\ntake all of this stuff and cut it out.\n\n328\n00:19:57.211 --> 00:19:59.627\nAnd put it right here.\n\n329\n00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:06.178\nOkay, all right, we're close, we're close.\n\n330\n00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:12.163\nBut instead of doing this here,\nwhat I'm thinking is create a buffer,\n\n331\n00:20:12.163 --> 00:20:17.171\nand a buffer I'm gonna say is\njust another canvas element.\n\n332\n00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:21.439\nDocument.createElement, so\nI can do this dynamically.\n\n333\n00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:25.170\nAnd I'm gonna create a canvas type\nelement, this is a separate canvas.\n\n334\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:32.718\nAnd I'm gonna set the buffer's\nheight to the images height.\n\n335\n00:20:32.718 --> 00:20:39.920\nSo, and then the buffer's width\nequal to the image width.\n\n336\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.415\nAnd then I want to\nresolve with the buffer.\n\n337\n00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:46.979\nOkay,.\n\n338\n00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:54.446\nNow, I can do something like this,\nload image, files, zero.\n\n339\n00:20:54.446 --> 00:20:56.677\nIf I didn't already have file zero here,\nright?\n\n340\n00:20:56.677 --> 00:20:58.707\nI need to make a couple of little changes.\n\n341\n00:20:58.707 --> 00:21:01.778\nFile name needs to be what's right here.\n\n342\n00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:11.188\nAnd now, we should get kind of a load,\nand then I can do something like then,\n\n343\n00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:15.563\nwhen you get the image, do something else.\n\n344\n00:21:15.563 --> 00:21:17.931\nSo let's just cancel that log the image.\n\n345\n00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:20.705\nNow, what is the image in this context?\n\n346\n00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:24.084\nWell, it's the image that\nI wrote to the buffer.\n\n347\n00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:28.036\nAnd so, we'll see that, hopefully.\n\n348\n00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:33.120\nSo if I refresh and I chose file,\nand I look at logo.png, and I open,\n\n349\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.966\nthat does have a canvas element,\nwhich is going to be our buffer.\n\n350\n00:21:37.966 --> 00:21:42.538\nI wonder, since this is a canvas element,\n\n351\n00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:47.239\nlet's more accurately call this a buffer.\n\n352\n00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:51.588\nCan I do ctx drawImage,\n\n353\n00:21:51.588 --> 00:21:55.071\nbuffer, 0, 0.\n\n354\n00:21:55.071 --> 00:22:01.581\nAnd if I do, well,\nchoose file, there we go.\n\n355\n00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:05.637\nOpen, and it looks like I broke something,\nZach, it is a-\n\n356\n00:22:05.637 --> 00:22:07.347\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh, is it time for\n\n357\n00:22:07.347 --> 00:22:09.242\nlive action debugging?\n\n358\n00:22:09.242 --> 00:22:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is actually a common issue.\n\n359\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.253\nIf you create a buffer like this-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:17.434\n&gt;&gt; What the buffer is,\nis a temporary canvas.\n\n361\n00:22:17.434 --> 00:22:19.729\nI created the width and\nthe height that I wanted but\n\n362\n00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:23.940\nI never actually wrote the image data to\nthe buffer in order to have it there.\n\n363\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.539\n&gt;&gt; So, buffer, done.\n\n364\n00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:29.207\nGet context.\n\n365\n00:22:29.207 --> 00:22:36.380\nSo you have to get this buffer's context,\ndrawImage of the image at 0,0.\n\n366\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.926\nSo they're the exact same size.\n\n367\n00:22:37.926 --> 00:22:39.385\nThe little canvass draw.\n\n368\n00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:43.597\nThink of it as you are painting\na full scale picture and the size,\n\n369\n00:22:43.597 --> 00:22:47.029\nthe sheet of paper or\nthe actual canvas in real life,\n\n370\n00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:50.309\nis exactly the size that\nyou need to paint that on.\n\n371\n00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:56.114\nNow, let's see if that resolves that\nissue, and refresh, and choose file.\n\n372\n00:22:56.114 --> 00:22:59.476\nAnd logo.png and open and boom.\n\n373\n00:22:59.476 --> 00:23:00.549\nWe're back in business.\n\n374\n00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:01.354\n&gt;&gt; Yehey.\n\n375\n00:23:01.354 --> 00:23:07.104\n&gt;&gt; But now, what that means is,\nYou know if I fold this up, load image.\n\n376\n00:23:07.104 --> 00:23:08.199\nI wonder what that does?\n\n377\n00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:10.347\nIt loads the image from a filename.\n\n378\n00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:16.544\nAnd I've hidden away so\nmuch of that craziness, right?\n\n379\n00:23:16.544 --> 00:23:17.074\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n380\n00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:19.848\n&gt;&gt; Load the image, then draw the image.\n\n381\n00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:20.666\nThat's it.\n\n382\n00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.136\nThat's all I need to do.\n\n383\n00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:25.982\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's pretty straight forward.\n\n384\n00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:27.481\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n385\n00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:29.881\nAgain Zack,\nI don't know if I helped you out but\n\n386\n00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:32.342\nit looks like I've cleaned\nthis up a little bit.\n\n387\n00:23:32.342 --> 00:23:33.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n388\n00:23:33.457 --> 00:23:35.720\n&gt;&gt; It's still a lot to think about, right?\n\n389\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.168\nI have an addEventListener load and\nget the image and here is our source and\n\n390\n00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:43.055\nour results and,\nadd another EventListener.\n\n391\n00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:47.016\nAnd then I resolve with that buffer,\nwhich has actually been,\n\n392\n00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:51.963\ncanvas that I've written the image to,\nand now I have that in memory, right?\n\n393\n00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:57.882\nThere's one final thing, I should\nprobably say, imageBuffer equals buffer.\n\n394\n00:23:57.882 --> 00:24:03.330\nAnd that way I can say logo.png open,\nthere it is.\n\n395\n00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.680\nLet's look at the image buffer, and\n\n396\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.690\nit is that canvas element that I'm gonna\nuse as a buffer for reading and writing.\n\n397\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:11.190\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n398\n00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.130\n&gt;&gt; That's how you get access to the image.\n\n399\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.200\nMost of the work is in\nthis load image function.\n\n400\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.590\nRight, we just got down and dirty.\n\n401\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.830\nWe got it done and I used to promise\nto deal with asynchronicity.\n\n402\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.870\nYou don't have to, but I think\nthe readability improves, at least for\n\n403\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.225\nme, whenever you wrap this in a promise.\n\n404\n00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:34.045\nCuz you want to load the image,\nthen you want to do some stuff.\n\n405\n00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:37.910\nBut you can't guarantee that they execute\none right after the other in standard\n\n406\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.235\nJavaScript because you're reading an image\nand creating an image and loading it up.\n\n407\n00:24:42.235 --> 00:24:46.480\nIt's actually asynchronous by nature,\nso using a promise helps.\n\n408\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.861\nLoad an image, then, with that buffer,\ndo this other stuff.\n\n409\n00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:55.370\nSo now kind of our main portion\nis pretty easy to follow.\n\n410\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.820\nThat load image could also\nbe used in other contexts,\n\n411\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.160\nbut that's how you handle\nthe actual images.\n\n412\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.280\nRight, so that's our first step\nto building our image editor.\n\n413\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Justin,\naccessing the image.\n\n414\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.030\nAnd before we move on, last words?\n\n415\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, now that we have our image there,\n\n416\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.080\nwe actually have to, think we should\nprobably do a little bit of cleanup,\n\n417\n00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.620\nseparate out into some modules,\nreorganize, refactor a little bit.\n\n418\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.960\nBut also, we ought to get that image\nmanipulation function .There's no point in\n\n419\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.190\nsaving if all you can do is load the image\nand save the exact same image, right?\n\n420\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.190\nSo I think the next thing is building\nour image manipulation functions,\n\n421\n00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.210\nwhich there's some math coming up.\n\n422\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.692\nThat's just by nature how it works.\n\n423\n00:25:36.692 --> 00:25:41.477\nBut we're gonna keep them fairly straight\nforward, fairly simple, so definitely stay\n\n424\n00:25:41.477 --> 00:25:45.770\ntuned for that because you'll be able\nto grayscale, add sepia or sepia tones.\n\n425\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sepia.\n\n426\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.718\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As well as brighten the image,\n\n427\n00:25:49.718 --> 00:25:52.150\nand then our last step is to save it.\n\n428\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.540\nSo pretty straight forward, but\ndoes a lot with a canvas and\n\n429\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.580\nsome asynchronicity for\nreading in files from a user.\n\n430\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.520\nThis is something where you could then\ntake that image that has been modified,\n\n431\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.390\nand then bundle it up and send it over\nto a server somewhere to be saved,\n\n432\n00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.900\nmaybe on S3 or something of that nature.\n\n433\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.050\nWe're just gonna keep an online\nbrowser just for learning purposes.\n\n434\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Justin, you do an amazing job,\nthank you very much.\n\n435\n00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.360\nHTML5 Canvas Projects,\nthere's a lot of episodes, watch them all.\n\n436\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.000\nAlso visit our course library,\n\n437\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.630\ncheck out any of the hundreds of videos\nthere all designed to help you go further.\n\n438\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.630\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n439\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.150\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n440\n00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.910\n&gt;&gt;

go.\n\n3\n00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:19.590\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nfor HTML 5 canvas project.\n\n4\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.200\nAnd this is building image manipulation\nfunctions with IT DevPro expert,\n\n5\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.790\nJustin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.360\nJustin, good to have you here,\nsir, and teach us.\n\n7\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.210\nLet us know how to do this.\n\n8\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; It is good to be back and yeah,\nthat's what we're doing this time around.\n\n9\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.835\nBut before we get to there,\nvery important question for you, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.050\nAre you here today?\n\n11\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm excited.\n\n12\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.560\nI wanna move forward and\nfind out about how we do this.\n\n13\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.647\nBut in last episode, we had a little bit\nof cleanup that we had to do in the way.\n\n14\n00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.580\nI don't think that was all done yet,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.120\nWe have to do a little more cleanup.\n\n16\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.320\n&gt;&gt; You're probably right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.350\nThere's a lot going on in\nthe file as it stands.\n\n18\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.790\nWe had this load image function and\nit might be best to pull that out and\n\n19\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.540\nmaybe put it in a utils module or\na utils-type thing.\n\n20\n00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.039\nIn that way, we can keep all of those\nseparate, our main file very focused and\n\n21\n00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.910\nthat will make refactoring easier\nlater for the actual main application.\n\n22\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.820\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look in my screen here.\n\n23\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.260\nAnd well it's just plain.\n\n24\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680\nRight, this is the logo, we're good to go.\n\n25\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.490\nIf we come over here, this load image.\n\n26\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.600\nThat's right in the middle of that.\n\n27\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.040\nMaybe we shouldn't have that there.\n\n28\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.347\nI would really like to have\nsomething like utils.loadImage.\n\n29\n00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:33.836\nSo in order to do that, what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna create another file, and\n\n30\n00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:37.340\nactually let's create it\nin a JavaScript folder.\n\n31\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.905\nSo JS is the folder.\n\n32\n00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:43.150\nAnd then inside of that folder, and I'll\nshow you those close up here just shortly.\n\n33\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.960\nLet's create a utils.js.\n\n34\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.450\nNow, someone argued that utils\nshould be very specific, you know.\n\n35\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.830\nMore or less what happens is,\n\n36\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.420\nI start throwing things in utils that\ndon't really have any other place but\n\n37\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.860\nthey are like tools, right,\nthat I use for other purposes.\n\n38\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.188\nIt may be that loadImage ends up\nbeing in like an image module or\n\n39\n00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:11.675\nan image folder, or\nnot folder, excuse me, image.\n\n40\n00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:13.072\nBut for now it's going in utils.\n\n41\n00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:21.650\n[LAUGH] So what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna create a utils object.\n\n42\n00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.660\nAnd since I only need these ones and\n\n43\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.960\nthese are kind of like static methods,\nonly utils module.\n\n44\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.480\nI'm just going to use a standard\nobject literal or nothing fancy here.\n\n45\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.479\nThere's a bunch of ways to do this now.\n\n46\n00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.059\nIf your browser supported\n[INAUDIBLE] six modules,\n\n47\n00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.220\nwhich actually version of Chrome does.\n\n48\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.942\nWe would do this a different way but\nwithout a build of pipeline set up and\n\n49\n00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:47.422\nnot knowing what everybody's\nbrowser version is.\n\n50\n00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:49.535\nWe're just gonna go old school.\n\n51\n00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:53.486\nSo,we're kinda look over here,\n\n52\n00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:57.180\ngrab this loadImage function.\n\n53\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.680\nAnd I'm gonna come right here.\n\n54\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.380\nOne quick aside, speaking of browsers,\n\n55\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.420\nthe promises portion has been there for\na while.\n\n56\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.720\nThis is a native JavaScript\npromise that's new implementation.\n\n57\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.170\nIf you don't have this,\n\n58\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.660\nthen you would have to polyfill that and\njust look up promise polyfill.\n\n59\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.180\nIt should behave exactly the same way.\n\n60\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.140\nSo we're gonna leave that there.\n\n61\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.090\nIt's a giant function, but\nif I fold it up, utils has a load image.\n\n62\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.630\nNow I need to make sure that\nI put it on the index.html.\n\n63\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.205\nBecause if I don't, well things are broke.\n\n64\n00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:40.860\nSo script src = js/utils.js.\n\n65\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.360\nJust like so.\n\n66\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.570\nOkay?\n\n67\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.910\nSo there we go.\n\n68\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.820\nWe're good.\n\n69\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.870\nIf we come back,\nwe need to make sure we've got our utils.\n\n70\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.950\nIt's there.\n\n71\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.648\nWe come back in app.js, we make sure\nthat we use that namespace, so to speak,\n\n72\n00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:56.670\nutils.loadImage.\n\n73\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.240\nLet's refresh, unexpected identifier.\n\n74\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.900\nUtils line two, it'll get you every time.\n\n75\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.300\nWell, why is that?\n\n76\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.821\nWell, because I'm using this new\nmethod syntax inside of this object.\n\n77\n00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:18.470\nI don't actually need\nthe function keyword.\n\n78\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.570\nIf I wanted to keep the function keyword,\n\n79\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.340\nthen I would have to do something\nlike loadImage: function loadImage.\n\n80\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.970\nAnd that's perfectly fine but\n\n81\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.690\nI'm just gonna use a short hand which\ndoes some of the aliasing for me.\n\n82\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.962\nLet's refresh.\n\n83\n00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:35.510\nThat council.log error is gone.\n\n84\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.727\nLet's make sure it still works.\n\n85\n00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:43.370\nSo if we choose File and we go into\nimages and we go to the logo and we open.\n\n86\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.330\nThere it is, everything still works.\n\n87\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.680\nWe have now cleaned up our application\nfile just to this one event listener and\n\n88\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.120\nkind of this set up.\n\n89\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.390\nNow this still has some\nglobal namespace issues.\n\n90\n00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.330\nBut there they are.\n\n91\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.700\nJust as a quick aside,\nI told you I would show these.\n\n92\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.890\nI created a JavaScript folder,\na JS folder, and\n\n93\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.470\nput Utils inside of it, just to make\nsure everybody's on the same page.\n\n94\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.600\nBut I think that's the clean\nup that I wanted to finish,\n\n95\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.130\nmake sure we had done before we moved\nfurther, that way we can remove some of\n\n96\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.710\nthe noise from this particular file\nthat we're gonna continue working in.\n\n97\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.160\n&gt;&gt; So now that you have that cleaned up,\n\n98\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.400\nwhat exactly do you mean by\nimage manipulation function.\n\n99\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.730\n&gt;&gt; So, an image is made up of an array of\nred, green, blue, and alpha data, right?\n\n100\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.230\nAnd actually if you look\nat some of our library.\n\n101\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.630\nI talk about this a little bit when we\ntalk about just entry level HTML5 canvas.\n\n102\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.230\nBut the red, green, blue and\nalpha channels are arranged in an array.\n\n103\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.348\nIt's an array of integers, 0 to 255\nexcept for alpha I think is 0 to 1.\n\n104\n00:05:47.348 --> 00:05:51.620\nActually now that I think about,\nthe alpha might be 0 to 255 as well.\n\n105\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.890\nI would have to double check that but that\nalways gets weird because we wanna make\n\n106\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.610\nmake sure we have the same\namount of information.\n\n107\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.620\nAnd we'll take a look at\nthat just to confirm.\n\n108\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.700\nBut then what I wanna do is\nI want to read that data,\n\n109\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.290\nin order to get a grayscale, and I want to\nmanipulate that to create a new array and\n\n110\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.060\nthen overwrite that data\nwith that new array.\n\n111\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.220\nBecause kind of what a grayscale is,\n\n112\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.790\nis you just kind of blend\nall of the colors together.\n\n113\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.770\nFor a lack of better term, a little\nmore than that but it's a good thought.\n\n114\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.786\nWhat about sepia?\n\n115\n00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well sepia actually resets the red,\n\n116\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.560\ngreen and blue channels, right?\n\n117\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.917\nRGB values to a combination of red,\ngreen and blue for their, it's weird.\n\n118\n00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:37.657\nSo the red channel is like a combination\nof relative magnitudes of red, green and\n\n119\n00:06:37.657 --> 00:06:39.200\nblue with different variables.\n\n120\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.910\nSo that function gets\na little more complicated.\n\n121\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.430\nAnd then brighten kinda\njust turns all of them up.\n\n122\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.732\nI don't know if you've ever been in\nan equalizer or a car radiator or\n\n123\n00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:51.835\nsomeone just reaches over,\n[SOUND], or runs up.\n\n124\n00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:54.970\nThat's kind of what brighten does.\n\n125\n00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.135\nWith that said,\nthese functions are gonna be very\n\n126\n00:06:58.135 --> 00:06:59.150\nspecific,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n127\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.670\n&gt;&gt; To the transformation.\n\n128\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.250\nSo that's what I mean by\nthe image manipulation functions.\n\n129\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.505\nIt's gray scale, sepia and\nbrighten are going to transform data and\n\n130\n00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:14.771\noverride the data in the image in\norder to actually see it on the page.\n\n131\n00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:18.227\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so those are the function,\nso how does a user access it?\n\n132\n00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:20.870\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n133\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.200\nWe should probably actually get that\nworking before we even worry about\n\n134\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.960\ntransforming the image because\nthe user can't initiate the action,\n\n135\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.200\ndoesn't matter if\nthe function exists at all.\n\n136\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.901\n&gt;&gt; And they will be very sad.\n\n137\n00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:36.225\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to make\n\n138\n00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:37.510\nit gray scale, right?\n\n139\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.527\nSo you have to have some kind\nof user interactions there.\n\n140\n00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.880\nSo let's actually do that first.\n\n142\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; If we come back into my computer here,\n\n143\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.490\nwe have this kind of apply button.\n\n144\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.420\nAnd we have a filters chunk, right?\n\n145\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.467\nThis apply button.\n\n146\n00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:57.291\nHere's what I'm thinking for\na user interaction.\n\n147\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.670\nWe have the layout.\n\n148\n00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.513\nWe just need to create\nthe The customization.\n\n149\n00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:06.640\nSo when I select grayscale and\nI hit apply I want this to turn grayscale.\n\n150\n00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.870\nNow what that means is there is\na few things we have to consider.\n\n151\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.210\nThere has to be an image, right?\n\n152\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n153\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.380\n&gt;&gt; Right,\ngrayscale is meaningless without that.\n\n154\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.990\nBut also I need to know what they've\nselected when they click apply.\n\n155\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.180\nNow, I could change this around but\nthis allows me to not accidentally oops,\n\n156\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.600\nI selected the, that's not what I wanted.\n\n157\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.370\nNow, we are also only\napplying as one of the tap,\n\n158\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.130\nwe are not doing a layered approach,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.670\nI am not overriding, changing, overriding.\n\n160\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.160\nSo I can't do I want a gray-scale\nsepia brightened image.\n\n161\n00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.290\nYou either get a brightened version,\na sepia version, or a gray-scale version,\n\n162\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.140\nand then kind of an interesting\nextension is how would I then make those\n\n163\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.165\ncompound effects and\nthen to full disclosure, sometimes these\n\n164\n00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:59.070\ntransformations are kind of one way\nonly unless you do some other stuff.\n\n165\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.200\nAnd that means if you\nbrighten then grayscale,\n\n166\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.590\nyou may get a different effect than\nif you grayscale then btighten.\n\n167\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.320\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n168\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.230\nThey're not necessarily\nimposable at all times.\n\n169\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n170\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.890\n&gt;&gt; So\nI want him to click that apply button.\n\n171\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.540\nAnd I want it to grab the value\nfrom that select field.\n\n172\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.190\nAnd the run function accordingly.\n\n173\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.360\nThat's probably the fruit.\n\n174\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.040\nWe need to make sure that works out\nbefore we even worry about manipulating\n\n175\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.920\nthe image itself.\n\n176\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.270\nSo if we come over here,\nI wanna click the apply button.\n\n177\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.320\nBecause I say that that sounds\nlike an event listener.\n\n178\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.452\nSo apply dot click.\n\n179\n00:09:34.452 --> 00:09:39.056\nNope.I Add a bin listener,\nI was trying to make my own short\n\n180\n00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:43.515\ncuts.And then we get\nthe event,and there we go, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.060\nSo,what do we got?\n\n182\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.348\nLet's look at this event, this is a mouse\nevent,let's see if we know anything.So if\n\n183\n00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:55.890\nI click apply,there's a mouse\nevent.and when we look through here,\n\n184\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.570\nI don't see anything about the filters.\n\n185\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.660\nI need the ability to see the filters.\n\n186\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.560\nAnd let's move this\nover just a little bit.\n\n187\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.640\nSo when I click I wanna grab\nwhatever that filter selection is.\n\n188\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.350\nAnd then start using that\nto make a decision right?\n\n189\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.300\nSo if I come over here, filter.\n\n190\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.200\nNow I'm saying filter.\n\n191\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.690\nThose are actually\nthe transformations I for\n\n192\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.650\nsome reason I think of\na social media type of thing.\n\n193\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.650\nLet's apply this filter, let's apply\nthis filter and filters kinda like\n\n194\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.180\na lens that you hold in front of your\neye to filter out certain things.\n\n195\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.190\nWell that's not strickenly true and\nI'm gonna call them filters.\n\n196\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:47.870\nSo filter ToApply is\nfilters.value: I think that's it.\n\n197\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.700\nI think that's it.\n\n198\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.925\nLet's see here.\n\n199\n00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:54.160\nconsole.log(filterToApply).\n\n200\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.850\nAnd let's look around here.\n\n201\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.390\nSo if I click here that's none that's\nright because I selected no filter.\n\n202\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.700\nAnd if I click sepia.\n\n203\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.090\nSepia, sepia.\n\n204\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Tomato, tomato.\n\n205\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.010\n&gt;&gt; We've had extensive arguments\nabout how to pronounce that.\n\n206\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.020\nBut I think it very much a tomato,\ntomato, potato, potato.\n\n207\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.780\nBut I'm not sure anybody says potato.\n\n208\n00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.870\nAnyway so\n\n209\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.770\nsepia gets printed it out if I grab\nbrighten, then brighten gets printed out.\n\n210\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.210\nNotice this are lower case and\n\n211\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.620\nthis is important because during the set\nup of this I intentionally set values,\n\n212\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.930\nthese option values to none,\nto grayscale, to sepia, to brighten.\n\n213\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.570\nI need to know those because those\nare gonna be my decision makers.\n\n214\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.690\nSo that's what I want\nmy decision based on.\n\n215\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.900\nSo if I come over here, and\nI look just to make sure.\n\n216\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.310\nGrant, we've tried all the other ones.\n\n217\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.480\nWe should probably try this one.\n\n218\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.740\nGreyscale works.\n\n219\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.330\nNow we have access to that string.\n\n220\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:59.310\nAnd we could do something like this.\n\n221\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.302\nWe can say if.\n\n222\n00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:07.770\nFilter to apply === to\napply === great scale.\n\n223\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.640\nIn this case, when I have these\nmultiple kind of decisions to make.\n\n224\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.658\nI tend to a switch now some\npeople don't like switches.\n\n225\n00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:18.264\nI've read some some things,\nwell that actually a code smell.\n\n226\n00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:21.000\nYou have too many things\ngoing on in this function.\n\n227\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.230\nBut I need this click\nhandler to do all this logic.\n\n228\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.350\nSo, I use switches on this case.\n\n229\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.205\nWhat do I wanna switch on?\n\n230\n00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:31.060\nWell, for\nnone I will do a particular thing.\n\n231\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.820\nAnd what I do is I had to set all\nof these up to make sure they work.\n\n232\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.545\nNot a semicolon there.\n\n233\n00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:42.540\nbreak; case and\n\n234\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.980\nhere that is 'sepia' or 'sepia'.\n\n235\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.090\nAnd then case.\n\n236\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.390\nLet's see here.\n\n237\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:57.090\nWhat do I want what was that,\nbrighten, forgot my last option there.\n\n238\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.170\nAnd then break and then you should\nalways plan on having a default,\n\n239\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.840\nbut there's kind of our set up.\n\n240\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.780\nI'm gonna switch on this filter to apply,\nright?\n\n241\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.700\nAnd then do something If it's none,\ndo something, if it's case,\n\n242\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.852\ndo something, if it's sepia,\ndo something, if it's do something.\n\n243\n00:13:17.852 --> 00:13:21.600\nif it's none of those,\ndo something else, right?\n\n244\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.510\nNow, what I'm thinking is,\nis this none and this default might end up\n\n245\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.140\nbeing the same thing, but we're gonna\nwait and see if that's the case.\n\n246\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n247\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.740\nMy next order of action is\nto say no filter applied.\n\n248\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.830\nTo make sure this set up is correct.\n\n249\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:47.848\nSo console.log('grayscale!!').\n\n250\n00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:55.672\nAnd come over here, log Sepia.\n\n251\n00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:01.480\nAnd then brighten.\n\n252\n00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.500\nThere we go.\n\n253\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.260\nSo now when I click this,\n\n254\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.550\nbased on that selection I should\nget kind of different things.\n\n255\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.240\nAnd just to make sure\nit's not printing out.\n\n256\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.180\nTo the rescue.\n\n257\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.430\nI always like to add a little flair so\n\n258\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.530\nI know it's printing out\nwhat I expect it to.\n\n259\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.190\nBrighten the image, so there we go, So\n\n260\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.300\nif we refresh and\nI click apply, no filter apply.\n\n261\n00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.870\nOkay, grayscale.\n\n262\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.400\nGrayscale with exclamation points and\nthen sepia.\n\n263\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.897\nSepia to the rescue.\n\n264\n00:14:32.897 --> 00:14:35.750\nAnd then brighten Is brighten the image.\n\n265\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.556\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:37.091\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n267\n00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:42.423\n&gt;&gt; So our swish statement is set up,\nwe have our user interactions ready.\n\n268\n00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:47.353\nAnd well now what.\n\n269\n00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:51.485\nNow we don't actually have\nthe ability to do anything, right.\n\n270\n00:14:51.485 --> 00:14:52.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n\n271\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.430\nUser and actions are there, Zach.\n\n272\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.010\n&gt;&gt; You're setting up for something.\n\n273\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.690\nWhatdo we need to do next/\n&gt;&gt; Are we ready to build\n\n274\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.390\nthe functions now or we're not?\n\n275\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.380\n&gt;&gt; So\nI think we can start out the functions.\n\n276\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.530\nI'm not sure that it's\nbest to go deep down\n\n277\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.010\ncuz we've actually covered a fair\namount cleanup of things here.\n\n278\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.130\nLet's just get them studded out set\nup how we're are gonna look at them.\n\n279\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.640\nAnd then maybe we'll comeback and\nlook at the implementation details.\n\n280\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.340\nCuz I wanna talk a little bit\nthe color channels a little more.\n\n281\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.710\nSo So I actually start\nbuilding the function module.\n\n282\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That is going to help us, right?\n\n283\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.490\nSo if we come here,\n\n284\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.650\nI'm just gonna start building this end\nfile then we'll pull that out later.\n\n285\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna call this Filters.\n\n286\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.470\nJust like so, it is as an object literal,\nit's gonna have some methods on it.\n\n287\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.010\nNow, what methods do I want?\n\n288\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.332\nI want a grayscale method,\n\n289\n00:15:45.332 --> 00:15:51.692\nI want a brighten method,\nand I want a sepia method.\n\n290\n00:15:54.077 --> 00:16:00.854\nOkay, now what I'm thinking is,\nsince we have this image buffer in memory,\n\n291\n00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:07.777\nWe're probably going to pass that\nimage buffer in, To get a result.\n\n292\n00:16:07.777 --> 00:16:10.741\nSo all of these are going to take buffers,\nright?\n\n293\n00:16:12.366 --> 00:16:16.671\nNot the original image that we read in,\nbut\n\n294\n00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:20.388\nthe canvas created from that image.\n\n295\n00:16:20.388 --> 00:16:22.324\nSo here's our buffers.\n\n296\n00:16:22.324 --> 00:16:27.428\nAnd for now,\nlet's just return that buffer,\n\n297\n00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:33.273\nReturn that buffer and\n\n298\n00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:38.910\nreturn the buffer like so.\n\n299\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.095\nOkay, so what that means is I'm\ngonna have something like this.\n\n300\n00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:50.155\nFor a let, NewImage.\n\n301\n00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:52.056\nIt's nothing, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:59.590\nWell, here,\nnewImage is gonna be equal to Filters.\n\n303\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.030\nWell, actually that's not what we want.\n\n304\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.660\nThat one's not gonna be anything.\n\n305\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:11.003\nThe new image is just going\nto be the imageBuffer, right?\n\n306\n00:17:11.003 --> 00:17:19.213\nAnd then here, the newImage is going\nto be Filters.grayscale of the buffer.\n\n307\n00:17:21.294 --> 00:17:26.252\nAnd here we're gonna have newImage\n\n308\n00:17:26.252 --> 00:17:31.049\n= filters.sepia of the buffer.\n\n309\n00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:33.514\nSo it's an input output operation.\n\n310\n00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:37.395\nAnd then a newImage = filters.\n\n311\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.811\nBright of the buffer.\n\n312\n00:17:43.964 --> 00:17:45.510\nOkay.\n\n313\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.040\nSo, since this kinda flows through\nright down at the bottom, right?\n\n314\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.700\nEvery time we have a new image,\n\n315\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.920\nwe're guaranteed to have\nsomething unless it's default.\n\n316\n00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.200\nAnd now that I look at it,\n\n317\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.770\nwe should probably just not apply\nanything if the selection is not valid.\n\n318\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.190\nSo instead of having a case for\nnone, right?\n\n319\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.560\nI think this should just be the default,\nand we can just remove none.\n\n320\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.321\nSo that's a little bit of cleanup,\na little bit of niceness there, and\n\n321\n00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:14.022\nthere we go.\n\n322\n00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:22.797\nAnd then, finally, we can just say\ncontext.drawImage of the newImage at 0, 0.\n\n323\n00:18:22.797 --> 00:18:25.815\nJust like that, okay?\n\n324\n00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:33.259\nSo if we refresh, and, failed to executive\ndrawImage because there's nothing there.\n\n325\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.520\nWell, we'll have to fix that.\n\n326\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.540\nWell, we'll do some of these\nedge cases here later.\n\n327\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.960\nBut, let's just make sure\nwe have an image there.\n\n328\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.328\nAnd I was about to hit back.\n\n329\n00:18:44.328 --> 00:18:46.220\nIf we apply, nothing happens.\n\n330\n00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.275\nWell, that's what we expect.\n\n331\n00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:52.817\nGrayscale, buffer is not defined.\n\n332\n00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:55.553\nSo what is the buffer?\n\n333\n00:18:57.058 --> 00:19:04.412\nThe buffer in this case is the image\nbuffer that we read in from the file.\n\n334\n00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:09.640\nOkay, so I'm going to pass in that\nimage buffer, get a new one back.\n\n335\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.485\nSo refresh, choose the file,\nboom, open, apply, that's fine.\n\n336\n00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:18.790\nGrayscale.\n\n337\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.540\nThat's fine.\n\n338\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.275\nAnd all it's doing is\nimmediately returning it, so\n\n339\n00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:22.830\nyou're not gonna see any difference.\n\n340\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:28.058\nBut we just wanna make sure that\nthese functions are set up.\n\n341\n00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:30.110\nAnd, well, Zach,\nif we really, really, really,\n\n342\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.600\nreally went crazy,\nwe might be able to finish.\n\n343\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.400\nBut I'm pretty sure we're not\ngonna be able to actually get\n\n344\n00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.240\nthe implementation details worked out for\nthese respective image transformations.\n\n345\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.641\nSo maybe we'll come back in a part two,\n\n346\n00:19:42.641 --> 00:19:44.598\nmake sure they have their\nappropriate amount of time.\n\n347\n00:19:44.598 --> 00:19:48.649\nAnd that way,\nwe can look at the differences and\n\n348\n00:19:48.649 --> 00:19:53.727\nsimilarities between Brighten,\nSepia, and Grayscale.\n\n349\n00:19:53.727 --> 00:19:58.247\nAnd then there might be some other things\nthat we need to do like edge case handling\n\n350\n00:19:58.247 --> 00:19:58.860\nand so on.\n\n351\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Building image manipulation\nfunctions part one.\n\n352\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.650\nThere will be a part two,\nand before we move on,\n\n353\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.380\nI know you have some final thoughts.\n\n354\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're really close to\ngetting like that last little right?\n\n355\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.360\nAnd once we get this part done,\n\n356\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.220\nit's just being able to save the image and\nwe are finished.\n\n357\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.350\nAgain, just to reiterate,\nthis is one of those learning experiences.\n\n358\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.010\nIt's not necessarily this is the absolute\nbest approach if you're going\n\n359\n00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.690\nhighly scalable production deployment.\n\n360\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.760\nBut this is a good way to start think,\nlet me build something,\n\n361\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.460\nlet me see how it works,\nlet me try to figure some things out.\n\n362\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.400\nAnd that way,\n\n363\n00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.700\nyou have skills that kind of play into\nwhatever you need to do in the future.\n\n364\n00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.480\n&gt;&gt; So, building image manipulation\nfunctions part two coming your way.\n\n365\n00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.560\nAnd make sure you see all of\nHTML5 canvas projects episodes.\n\n366\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.900\nCheck out the course library,\n\n367\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.570\nthere's hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n368\n00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.990\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they will be so glad you did.\n\n369\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.660\nThanks for watching.\n\n370\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.550\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n371\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n372\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.016\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n373\n00:20:59.016 --> 00:21:05.139\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.361\nwelcome back to another great episode here\nat DevProTV, I'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.371\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.290\nwe'll be looking at Saving the Image\nhere with Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.720\nJustin, how you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.890\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, sir,\nand well, how are you today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.890\nIn our past episode, you were telling us a\nlittle bit about building the image and so\n\n10\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.510\nfar, that's where we're at, right?\n\n11\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.460\nWe were talking about this just\nbefore we even started the episode.\n\n12\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.550\nYou said that we needed to do\na little bit of cleanup and\n\n13\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.700\na little bit of organization.\n\n14\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.820\nJustin, tell us how we're\ngonna go about handling that.\n\n15\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the clean up and\norganization is definitely something that\n\n16\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.720\nas I build up a project I'm like\nlet me just get it working.\n\n17\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.138\nLet me get back and clean it up so\nI can remove the noise, Right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.683\nIn a previous episode we built the\nfilters, and we have those on module and\n\n19\n00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:03.376\nwell an object literal effectively we\nreally wanna pull those out of the main\n\n20\n00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:04.380\nout file.\n\n21\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.520\nThat way, maybe they're more reusable but\n\n22\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.780\nalso, it's just a lot going\non in that main file, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.845\nSo we need to shrink that down,\npull it out.\n\n24\n00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:18.340\nDo some organization as well as there is a\nmethod on the filters object that I really\n\n25\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.790\nthink should be in the utils object, or\nwe need to make sure all of that works.\n\n26\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.000\nSo actually, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n27\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500\nAnd just as a brief reminder,\neverything works real nice, right?\n\n28\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.820\nYou can apply different filters like so,\n\n29\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.110\nand save doesn't work,\nbut we'll get to that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.160\nHowever, if we come over and we look.\n\n31\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.920\nHere's this filters kind of object, right?\n\n32\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.170\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nhold this out just like so.\n\n33\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.510\nAnd these are kind of incremental changes\n\n34\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.500\nthat I wanna make sure they still\nwork when I pull things out of there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.130\nSo I'm gonna bring it over here.\n\n36\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.330\nAnd inside of my JS folder I'm gonna\ncreate a new file called Filters.js and\n\n37\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.870\nI'm just gonna paste that in, you gotta\nput JS in there cuz that stuff going to JD\n\n38\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.090\nand syntax style will not work if you have\nthe wrong file extension, there we go!\n\n39\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.190\nSo there's then.\n\n40\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.190\nI wanna make sure that still works now\nbefore we forget we need to come over here\n\n41\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.300\nand put this into our\nrespective HTML file.\n\n42\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.410\nSo let's duplicate and filters, like so.\n\n43\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.950\nSo there's filters, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.880\nNow my duplication was just Cmd+Shift+D,\nCtrl+Shift+D for Windows and Linux users.\n\n45\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440\nI think everything should still work.\n\n46\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.650\nBut we should probably go check it out.\n\n47\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.880\nLet's refresh All right give no\nconsole warning let's choose the file.\n\n48\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.430\nAnd let's grab our logo here.\n\n49\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.730\nThere it is let's make sure the gray\nscale still works and it does.\n\n50\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.590\nLet's make sure the app store\nstill works and it does.\n\n51\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.360\nThey're very similar but except there's\na little more of a reddish hue and\n\n52\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.640\nthen if we go to brighten there we go,\nwe have some brightness added to it.\n\n53\n00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.030\nBut our saves do not work.\n\n54\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.200\nI guess, we'll get to that.\n\n55\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.730\nNow, we got our initial kind of clean up.\n\n56\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.000\nBut like I said, right,\nour app.js is a little cleaner.\n\n57\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.810\nIt's more focused so to speak.\n\n58\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.065\nIt's just even listeners that help us\ncreating interactions based on this DOMs.\n\n59\n00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:26.926\nNow these DOM elements.\n\n60\n00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:30.017\nNow there's this image buffer\nthat we're wanna use as a global\n\n61\n00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:33.370\nvariable we could always\npull that into a module.\n\n62\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.230\nHowever, in this filters\nfile there's this copy.\n\n63\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.280\nAnd I really think that this is\nbetter named called copy buffer.\n\n64\n00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.790\nAnd it's more of a utilitarian function,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.040\nIt might not be that we\nonly use it in filters.\n\n66\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.010\nWe may use it in order to copy buffers,\n\n67\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.640\nand then do something else\nwith multiple buffers.\n\n68\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.778\nSo I'm gonna pull this out,\nI'm gonna grab this just like so,\n\n69\n00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:03.406\npull this out, and\ncome into the utils aand this loadImage,\n\n70\n00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:08.160\nI'm just gonna hide that away cuz\nthat was a lot of code there.\n\n71\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.450\nAnd I think that should be fine, but\nI'm gonna rename it to copyBuffer.\n\n72\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.360\nNow, just by doing this reorganization,\n\n73\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.360\nif I hit a key that refreshes,\nwe're gonna see something interesting.\n\n74\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.012\nOpen, and\nthen let's try to apply the filter and\n\n75\n00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:30.250\nuh-oh, this._copy is not a function.\n\n76\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.800\nWell, it's not a function because I\nremoved it from the filters object.\n\n77\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.940\nWhat I really need is to use\nutils.copyBuffer inside of filters, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.361\nSo this.copy I just gonna\nselect all of those and\n\n79\n00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:47.699\nI did that by highlighting and\nhitting Cmd+D,\n\n80\n00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.304\nI will select the next instance and\nI did that 3 time to get all 3.\n\n81\n00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:55.860\nIt Ctrl+D if I'm not mistaken\nin windows and Linux.\n\n82\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.119\nWhat I'm gonna do is now\nhave multiple cursors and\n\n83\n00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:02.877\nI'm gonna just type utils.copyBuffer and\n\n84\n00:05:02.877 --> 00:05:07.450\nwas remove those extra parentheses and\nthere we go utils.copyBuffer.\n\n85\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.080\nThat should work.\n\n86\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.410\nOne final thing before we get test it,\nI always like to make sure this,\n\n87\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.700\nsince we're using these\nkinda global things.\n\n88\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.680\nThis has a dependency on utils now, right?\n\n89\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.400\nFilters uses something in utils.\n\n90\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.910\nIf you're using these globals\nif this was to run immediately,\n\n91\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.150\nit would error out,\nif these were not in correct order.\n\n92\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.060\nSo if I move these, well,\nwait for it, wait for\n\n93\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.490\nit, what I mean is, if I come over\nhere and I were to move these,\n\n94\n00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.670\nand if the gray scale filter work to run\non page load for any reason, then I would\n\n95\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.470\nget an error message because utils would\nnot be defined until after filter is ran.\n\n96\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.760\nBut since these are functions that\nare gonna be used in the context of event\n\n97\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.450\nhandlers and things that will always kind\nof run afterwards, we should be fine.\n\n98\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.637\nBut I always like to make\nsure those work well.\n\n99\n00:06:03.637 --> 00:06:06.652\nThat is solved with using\nlike ES6 modules and\n\n100\n00:06:06.652 --> 00:06:11.292\nso like modules bundling system where\nyou make sure you have a layerable\n\n101\n00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:14.483\nin scope of what you are building to you,\nright?\n\n102\n00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.350\nSo but we don't have that here.\n\n103\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.790\nBut if you do have the excitement\nto try this with other kind of\n\n104\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.403\nwork flow set ups you may not encounter\nthat problem but something to remember.\n\n105\n00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:29.040\nSo if we refresh, hopefully you will not\nget that horrible error message anymore.\n\n106\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.280\nAnd here is our Open,\n\n107\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.150\nlet's make sure all of our filters\nstill work and it looks like they do.\n\n108\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.730\nAnd we should brighten and\nwell, save still isn't working.\n\n109\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.620\nHowever, we have completed our,\nkind of reorganization and clean up.\n\n110\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.350\nBut I'm pretty happy of\nwhere this is right now.\n\n111\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Justin,\nI've noticed you've done your clean up,\n\n112\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.380\nyou've done your spring cleaning and\nwe're ready to save the image.\n\n113\n00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.880\nHowever, also notice that bug that\nyou have there is kind of broken.\n\n114\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.650\nNow what do we need to do to fix that?\n\n115\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n116\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.530\nI was just hoping it would magically\nwork on one of those page refreshes.\n\n117\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.160\nBut unfortunately that's not\nhow application development,\n\n118\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.770\nyou just cross your fingers and you go\nI hope that it works this time around.\n\n119\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.610\nI don't know, sometimes I do that,\nplease work, please work.\n\n120\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.550\nBut now that button, first off we need\nsomeway to allow the user to interact it,\n\n121\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.950\nto click it, right?\n\n122\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.150\nSo we should do that setup first.\n\n123\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.550\nThen, that save actually needs\nthe ability to save the image.\n\n124\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.670\nNow the image that I'm talking\nabout is the entire canvas.\n\n125\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.150\nOkay, that is a decision that I have made.\n\n126\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.600\nWe can always make another decision,\nbut maybe then,\n\n127\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.810\nit will be an interesting\nextension project, right?\n\n128\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.550\nIt's like if I put you in\na state of discomfort,\n\n129\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.600\nyou may push forward and\ntry to fix it yourself.\n\n130\n00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.391\nAnd so\nyou'll see what I mean in just a moment.\n\n131\n00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:49.779\nSo let's go ahead and get that Save button\nactually just clicking first before we\n\n132\n00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.340\nworry about anything else.\n\n133\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.385\nI can close out these other\nones because This is for\n\n134\n00:07:55.385 --> 00:08:00.620\nthe most part going to be inside\nof this application, app.js.\n\n135\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.460\nSo we have our apply, we have our open and\nnow we want to work on our save.\n\n136\n00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.593\nSo we're gonna add an EventListener and\non click, I need a comma there.\n\n137\n00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:15.880\nWe need hour of event, right?\n\n138\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.310\nSo let's see.\n\n139\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.460\nWe wanna make sure\nthe click event is firing.\n\n140\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.400\nSo I'm just gonna console.log the\n[INAUDIBLE] I don't technically need that.\n\n141\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.900\nBut that's completely okay.\n\n142\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.720\nSo save, save, save, save.\n\n143\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.270\nAll right.\n\n144\n00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.970\nSo the click works.\n\n145\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.573\nGood deal.\n\n146\n00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:34.360\nI'm gonna stub out what I'm thinking.\n\n147\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.530\nI need some way to download\nthe [INAUDIBLE] so that says logo.png.\n\n148\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:45.419\nThat's perfectly fine, but then it will be\nbad to save it as logo.png again I think.\n\n149\n00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:48.520\nSo let's just do a random file name.\n\n150\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.771\nSo let's say filename equals,\n\n151\n00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:58.048\nand let's put new tills,\n\n152\n00:08:58.048 --> 00:09:03.500\nrandom filename and wait for it.\n\n153\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.070\nImage filenames are probably\ndependent on extension.\n\n154\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.050\nAnd I should, if it's random, I probably\nwant some way to tweak the length, right?\n\n155\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.600\nI can get 30 characters or\nmaybe I just want 3 characters.\n\n156\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.690\nI'm gonna hard code this for now, but this\nis something that we could tweak around.\n\n157\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.880\nSo here's our random filename.\n\n158\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.140\nNow, this doesn't exist yet but we'll\ntry to use this as potentially break.\n\n159\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin,\ndo we have to use a random file name or\n\n160\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.310\nis this something that we can\nbe a little bit more specific?\n\n161\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.510\nDo we have to use the random file?\n\n162\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.290\n&gt;&gt; So I think what we could do is we\ncould either reuse the name that it was,\n\n163\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.300\nwe could make up a name.\n\n164\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.610\nSo if you were building this application\nto leave a mean existence, right?\n\n165\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.420\nAlways want people to come back\nto those meme generator sites.\n\n166\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.830\nYou may wanna put the domain name and\nthen maybe some little one, or\n\n167\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.810\ntwo, or three, or maybe domain name and\na topic, or something like that.\n\n168\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.370\nYou could do something where it's set.\n\n169\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.930\nI'm just gonna use a random filename,\nso we do have different filenames.\n\n170\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.440\nAnd so we don't kinda have\nthis overwrite behavior or\n\n171\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.137\nif you ever had where you download, you\nget the filename, filename1, filename 2.\n\n172\n00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:14.546\nSo I'm just doing to avoid that and\n\n173\n00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:19.900\nalso not to accidentally get it mixed\nup with, but these are all logo.png.\n\n174\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.760\nI don't know which one's what?\n\n175\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.360\nSo we don't have to.\n\n176\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.120\nI just think it would be a fun exercise,\nright?\n\n177\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.470\nI like programming, and\nit actually plays well here.\n\n178\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.910\nNow I don't think the file name\nshould be three characters.\n\n179\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:40.650\nI'm thinking probably about 12 characters,\n12 random, just a, b, c, d blah blah blah.\n\n180\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.707\nThis doesn't exist here so\nthis would break.\n\n181\n00:10:42.707 --> 00:10:46.391\nBut after I get that random\nfilename what I'm thinking is,\n\n182\n00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:48.683\nI can say something like save image.\n\n183\n00:10:48.683 --> 00:10:53.799\nNow I'm relying on kind\nof this global state,\n\n184\n00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:56.954\nto actually save the image.\n\n185\n00:10:56.954 --> 00:11:02.920\nSo we may treat that at some point but\nfor now this is all I wanna do.\n\n186\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.030\nWhen I click that save, boom,\nI wanna save the image.\n\n187\n00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.730\nNow what do I mean by to save the image?\n\n188\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.060\nI could call this download image or\nsomething.\n\n189\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.927\nI wanna save,\nyou want to be able to save it yourself.\n\n190\n00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:14.520\nBut when I click save the image,\n\n191\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.430\nwhat I want to happen is just download\nback out of the browser as a reproduction.\n\n192\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.820\nNow, neither one of these actually exist,\nso\n\n193\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.240\nwe actually need to implement\nthose in order for them to work.\n\n194\n00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.123\nSo, let's come up here and say, save,\nthat is not how you spell const,\n\n195\n00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:34.803\nsaveImage, and\nit is gonna take a filename.\n\n196\n00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:36.890\nAnd what is it gonna do?\n\n197\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.141\nHmm, well with the file name,\nhere's kind of an interesting\n\n198\n00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:45.820\ntrick with these browsers,\nis we can create an anchor tag.\n\n199\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:52.717\nSo we can create element\n(a) just like that.\n\n200\n00:11:52.717 --> 00:11:55.500\nActually not just like that.\n\n201\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.117\nYou may actually need to have quotes here.\n\n202\n00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:02.149\nAnd then we can say href equals and\n\n203\n00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:05.750\nthen there's image buffer.\n\n204\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:16.200\nThis image buffer should\nhave the two data URL, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.560\nWe should have this the ability to\ncreate a data URL from the image buffer.\n\n206\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.072\nNow, we may have to do\nsome on the fly debugging\n\n207\n00:12:24.072 --> 00:12:28.860\ntoDataURL like so, or\nwe could say image.png.\n\n208\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.770\nNow before you move any further,\nyou've got PNGs and you've got JPEGs.\n\n209\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:39.040\nGifs, right, if you want it in a GIF file,\nthese don't quite work out yet.\n\n210\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.224\nYou'd have to bring an external\nJavaScript library or\n\n211\n00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:42.890\nyou would have to implement it yourself.\n\n212\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.659\nSo it writes the GIF headers and\nall of these in.\n\n213\n00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.680\nI think that's a little beyond\nthe scope of what we are trying to\n\n214\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.591\nachieve with this application,\nso we are not gonna do that.\n\n215\n00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:56.079\nBut we can set the link there and then\nI'm gonna actually generate the image and\n\n216\n00:12:56.079 --> 00:13:00.091\nwe've seen that in a previous episode\nwhere you can grab the data URL,\n\n217\n00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:01.387\nset it to an image tag.\n\n218\n00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:06.220\nBut since we're sending the link,\nthat more or less is this is a file.\n\n219\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.361\nAnd then I can say link.downloader\n\n220\n00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.180\nequals the file name.\n\n221\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.050\nAnd this download attribute on a link\nsays when you click this link,\n\n222\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.510\nyou're actually gonna download a file.\n\n223\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.780\nWhat file?\nThe file that's referenced in the href.\n\n224\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.160\nAnd it will download it to the file name.\n\n225\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.114\nAnd then I'm just gonna say, link.click\n\n226\n00:13:33.114 --> 00:13:38.210\ncuz I'm gonna simulate it click on\na virtual link, and that will download.\n\n227\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.860\nSo you never actually see the link.\n\n228\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.930\nBut when I click the Save button,\nit creates a file name,\n\n229\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.670\nit calls save image which\ncreates an in memory hyperlink,\n\n230\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.860\nsets these attributes for\nthe href and the download attributes.\n\n231\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.760\nAnd then it simulates a click on that.\n\n232\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.580\nAnd by simulating a click like that,\nit will click that virtual link and\n\n233\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.530\nit will download.\n\n234\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.690\nThat's the ultimate goal.\n\n235\n00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.150\nNow that's our saved image.\n\n236\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.360\nThis is actually pretty easy.\n\n237\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.700\nBut this random file name,\nwe should probably implement that.\n\n238\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.930\nSo, that's actually gonna\ntake a little bit of work-\n\n239\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.290\n&gt;&gt; And just so you know,\n\n240\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.930\nwhat I think is interesting is\nby using that random file name.\n\n241\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.880\nYou're actually providing\na little bit of organization.\n\n242\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.090\nWho would have thought randomness\n\n243\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.670\nwould actually-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Give you a little bit\n\n245\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.700\nof organization on the back end.\n\n246\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.450\n&gt;&gt; We do not hold the same thing.\n\n247\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.410\nAnd I actually,\ntime stamps on these are different.\n\n248\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:31.960\nYeah.\n\n249\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.610\nI know those.\n\n250\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.357\nNo.\nTo scale it up a little bit,\n\n251\n00:14:35.357 --> 00:14:38.950\nI could probably say, grab the filter\nname, append that on there.\n\n252\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:45.419\nRandom file name.filter name, and that way\nit's blah, blah, blah, .grey scale, .png.\n\n253\n00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:49.855\nBut that might be an area of\ndiscomfort that maybe you wanna tackle.\n\n254\n00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:53.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's get that random file name, and\n\n255\n00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:56.085\nI think that's best used in the utils.\n\n256\n00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:58.050\nI might need to use this in other places.\n\n257\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.940\nSo let's create the random filename.\n\n258\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:10.460\nAnd that's going to take an extension,\nright, the file extension, and the length.\n\n259\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.400\nMoreover, we may have to add\nanother helper in here for\n\n260\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.260\nus but that's all right.\n\n261\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.580\nSo this random file name is,\nI'm gonna set some letters.\n\n262\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.320\nAnd I could set a large character set\n\n263\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.460\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuv, wxyz.\n\n264\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.040\nI think I got them all, Wes.\n\n265\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.835\nIf I missed any,\nyou'll have to keep me honest.\n\n266\n00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:46.313\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.\n\n267\n00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:46.871\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Everything except the\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n269\n00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.070\nThere you go.\n\n270\n00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.635\nWe're gonna leave that out.\n\n271\n00:15:51.635 --> 00:15:54.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n\n272\n00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:58.439\n7, 8, 9 Just to have some\npossible numbers in there.\n\n273\n00:15:58.439 --> 00:16:01.470\nNow this is my character set,\nthere's easier ways.\n\n274\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.990\nI could've just done lowercase letters and\n\n275\n00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.520\nthen called toUpper on those and\nconcatenated those.\n\n276\n00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.700\nOr I could put those in a constants file,\nand just be able to use those anywhere.\n\n277\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.264\nBut we'll just do it in place here.\n\n278\n00:16:11.264 --> 00:16:14.725\nAnd since this is multi-line,\nand I'm not using new strings,\n\n279\n00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:17.750\nyou have to have a plus\nhere otherwise it'll break.\n\n280\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.520\nYou can't have multi\nline strings with quotes.\n\n281\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.156\nSo now that we the letters,\n\n282\n00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:25.511\nwhat I'm thinking is I'm\ngonna call a builder object.\n\n283\n00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:29.696\nAnd it's just an empty string, and I'm\njust gonna kind of concatenate onto it.\n\n284\n00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:35.512\nAnd for[let i= 0 while i is less\n\n285\n00:16:35.512 --> 00:16:40.510\nthan the length, i += 1.\n\n286\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:45.843\nI'm gonna say builder equal,\nwhatever the builder was plus,\n\n287\n00:16:45.843 --> 00:16:52.597\nnow I need a random selection from that\ncharacter set, right from the letters.\n\n288\n00:16:52.597 --> 00:16:56.180\nI'm gonna say this.choice.\n\n289\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.580\nAnd choice doesn't exist.\n\n290\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.475\nI'm just gonna chose a random letter.\n\n291\n00:17:00.475 --> 00:17:07.680\nNow with that, that's all right,\nwe'll get there.\n\n292\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.680\nOnce the builders is done there,\nI'm just gonna return the builder object.\n\n293\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.060\nWhich is just a string in this case.\n\n294\n00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:18.318\nBut I'm not quite done,\nI'm not quite done.\n\n295\n00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:22.573\nIn this extension, now, Wes,\nI don't know about you, but\n\n296\n00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:25.827\nwhenever someone asked you for\nan extension,\n\n297\n00:17:25.827 --> 00:17:30.660\nsometimes they get a .PNG,\nsometimes they just get PNG, right?\n\n298\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.318\nI get some weirdness there.\n\n299\n00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:39.770\nSo just to make it a little\neasier to work with.\n\n300\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.278\nAnd I'm gonna say, extension =\n\n301\n00:17:44.278 --> 00:17:50.570\nextension.startswit('.'), right?\n\n302\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.150\nBecause if it does, then I just want\nto keep whatever they typed in,\n\n303\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.440\nor whatever is sent to them.\n\n304\n00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.450\nNow I'm using this internally,\nso I could keep this.\n\n305\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.340\nBut what if I wanted to reuse this?\n\n306\n00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.620\nJust making sure if someone's messing\naround here, we'll keep that.\n\n307\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.935\nAnd then, otherwise,\nI just want to say \".\",\n\n308\n00:18:12.935 --> 00:18:18.680\nand hit to another line apparently,\nextension like so.\n\n309\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.990\nSo if it starts with a period, keep it.\n\n310\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.360\nIf it doesn't, go ahead and\nput one on the front of it.\n\n311\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.850\nAnd that way we can can keep consistency.\n\n312\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.860\nThat also keeps me from\naccidentally messing up.\n\n313\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.360\nI forget the API and\njust a nice internal check.\n\n314\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.180\nWith that, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay plus extension.\n\n315\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.960\nSo whatever the random set of\ncharacters is plus the extension.\n\n316\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.320\nNow, that leaves us with\nthe choice portion.\n\n317\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.420\nLet's go ahead and make that choice and\na choice of some iterable.\n\n318\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.260\nSomething that I can iterate over, right?\n\n319\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.320\nIt could be a string,\nit could be a possible array.\n\n320\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.818\nI'm gonna create an index,\na random index by saying,\n\n321\n00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:10.342\nMath.floor of Math.random times iterable.\n\n322\n00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:16.002\nIterable.length, all right?\n\n323\n00:19:16.002 --> 00:19:20.418\nI'm kinda making the assumption that\nwherever you pass choice is going to be\n\n324\n00:19:20.418 --> 00:19:23.532\nkind of ordered and\nindexed by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n325\n00:19:23.532 --> 00:19:27.800\nIf it's not,\nthen this doesn't work, right?\n\n326\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.194\nI couldn't use this on an object,\n\n327\n00:19:29.194 --> 00:19:31.350\neven though an object could\npossibly have a length.\n\n328\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.910\nNow, I'm talking about a standard object,\nnot an array object,\n\n329\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.080\nwhich is an initerable.\n\n330\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.362\nAnyway, we're splitting hairs there.\n\n331\n00:19:37.362 --> 00:19:41.340\nThen we'll create, for a string and\nan array that will create a random index.\n\n332\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.042\nUniformly distributed over, so if I call\nit a bunch of times I will eventually get\n\n333\n00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:46.356\nall of the letters out of it.\n\n334\n00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:51.375\nAnd then I just want to return\niterable [index], like so.\n\n335\n00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:57.512\nOkay, iterable file name\nwhich require choice.\n\n336\n00:19:57.512 --> 00:20:00.580\nWe have our save image function.\n\n337\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.722\nAll right, I think this might work, Wes.\n\n338\n00:20:04.722 --> 00:20:08.828\nSo if we refresh,\nwe gotta cross our fingers.\n\n339\n00:20:08.828 --> 00:20:10.647\nLogo, Open.\n\n340\n00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:14.850\nLet's go ahead and make this sepia tone.\n\n341\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.224\nApply, and then I'm gonna click Save.\n\n342\n00:20:17.224 --> 00:20:19.100\nAnd look at there.\n\n343\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:26.120\nI now have, That's very interesting.\n\n344\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.082\nWhat happened?\n\n345\n00:20:28.082 --> 00:20:30.850\nHere's our on the spot debugging.\n\n346\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.920\nI know what I did.\n\n347\n00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:40.610\nImageBuffer is not what I wanted to save,\ncuz that's the original image.\n\n348\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.490\nI actually wanna save the canvas,\nwhatever is printed on\n\n349\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.870\nthe canvas cuz it's gonna be,\noops, shame on me.\n\n350\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.380\nSo let's refresh,\nlet's go through that one more time.\n\n351\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.748\nLogo &gt; Open &gt;Apply the sepia filter.\n\n352\n00:20:56.748 --> 00:20:59.540\nThe save did work, though, right?\n\n353\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.000\nIt actually saved exactly\nwhat I told it to.\n\n354\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.360\nSave, here's our random file name,\nand then there's our sepia filter.\n\n355\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.209\nSo here's our Sepia tone image,\nand here's our random file name,\n\n356\n00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:15.342\nthat's just a bunch of blah,\nblah, blah,blah, blah.\n\n357\n00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.470\nHere's the point of,\nI don't know if I like that.\n\n358\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.480\nSee how big this image is?\n\n359\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.945\nIt only draws this ,but it also\ndraws the entire rest of the canvas\n\n360\n00:21:25.945 --> 00:21:27.615\nas a transparent background.\n\n361\n00:21:27.615 --> 00:21:33.157\nNow I could fix that but\nit's actually a pretty easier tweak, I'll\n\n362\n00:21:33.157 --> 00:21:37.930\ngive you a hint and this is something to\ntry to make this a little better, right?\n\n363\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.074\nI've been talking about making\nit better making it better.\n\n364\n00:21:40.074 --> 00:21:45.700\nIteration, iteration, cuz as it stands\nour image editor is done, finished.\n\n365\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.325\nInstead of doing, wait for it,\n\n366\n00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:53.891\nthis apply where I just set it internal,\n\n367\n00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:59.666\nI can actually pull this out and\nthen modify the save\n\n368\n00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:04.660\nto only have the changed\nimage being saved.\n\n369\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.610\nBut it's such a simple change,\nmaybe you can give it a try.\n\n370\n00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.470\nBut there you have it, Wes,\nour image editor is complete.\n\n371\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.640\nWell, complete.\n\n372\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.350\nI don't know if software\nis ever really done.\n\n373\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.846\nBut it's a nice adventure\ninto you suing the canvas for\n\n374\n00:22:16.846 --> 00:22:20.116\nimage manipulation and\njust basic interactions.\n\n375\n00:22:20.116 --> 00:22:21.300\nI had an idea.\n\n376\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.744\nTried to make it come to fruition.\n\n377\n00:22:22.744 --> 00:22:23.880\nIt's not the prettiest.\n\n378\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.000\nBut it is functional, and\nI've learned a great deal.\n\n379\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.300\nAnd hopefully you did as well.\n\n380\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of great information\non taking that image and\n\n381\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.680\ncreating a downloaded file.\n\n382\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.340\nNow it does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, Justin,\n\n383\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.845\nbut before we do, do you got\nanything else that you'd like to\n\n384\n00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:41.595\nmaybe tell our viewers out there that are\nworking in HTML5 right now as we speak.\n\n385\n00:22:41.595 --> 00:22:46.225\n&gt;&gt; Well I would definitely say the things\nthat you see or just any idea, try to make\n\n386\n00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:49.635\nthem come to fruition, even if it's not\nhow you originally planned it, right?\n\n387\n00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:52.883\nOne of the greatest things when I'm\nhelping people learn to program,\n\n388\n00:22:52.883 --> 00:22:54.985\nthey're like I want to make unreal, right?\n\n389\n00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:59.890\nUnreal tournament, or I want to\nmake something World of Warcraft.\n\n390\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.472\nI'm like, well, let just try\nto get an image on the screen.\n\n391\n00:23:02.472 --> 00:23:04.618\nLet's take it a step at a time, and\n\n392\n00:23:04.618 --> 00:23:09.140\nonce you have a finished product try\nto extend it, try to make it better.\n\n393\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.610\nSo it's kind of why I left off with,\nhere's a pin point, see if you can fix it,\n\n394\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.890\nsee if you can and it really help you\nunderstand the code a little more.\n\n395\n00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.608\nThat's my first thing and then secondly,\nwell, it's kind of practice.\n\n396\n00:23:22.608 --> 00:23:24.780\nAs long as you do it,\nyou're always gonna get better.\n\n397\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, practice makes perfect.\n\n398\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.570\nIt does look like that is\na great place to wrap it up.\n\n399\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.368\nKeep in mind that we got a lot more\nto come in HTML5 Canvas Project.\n\n400\n00:23:32.368 --> 00:23:35.600\nBut you're going to have to come back or\nstick around and continue watching.\n\n401\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.770\nSigning out for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n402\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.562\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n403\n00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:40.170\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n404\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.430\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.651\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, as we continue\nour journey in HTML 5 Canvas Projects.\n\n4\n00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.870\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n5\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.042\nJustin, how you doing today, Sir?\n\n6\n00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:27.982\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic,\nI'm glad to be back and, well,\n\n7\n00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.811\nI'm pretty excited about\nthese series of episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:32.510\nBut more importantly, how are you, Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.190\nNow, we're gonna be planning\na project here, Justin.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.900\nAnd one of the things I have to ask,\nwhat are we playing for?\n\n12\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.010\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI do like to set some anticipation, right?\n\n13\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.650\nA good movie has a good entrance,\na wonderful kinda middle part and\n\n14\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.650\nthen a resolution, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.990\nSo we have those three parts.\n\n16\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.500\nNow, I didn't necessarily\nsay those appropriately.\n\n17\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.719\nSome people are like that's\nnot the three parts, right?\n\n18\n00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.010\n[LAUGH] Yeah, but look,\nthe build and then the resolution.\n\n19\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.150\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things I think is great\nis that he says we're planning a project\n\n20\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.410\nand if we tale a look at it,\nthis is the project we are planning,\n\n21\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.801\nso that's how much I know.\n\n22\n00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n23\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.290\nif we are going to be planning a project\nhere Justin Where do we start?\n\n24\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me set the scene for\nyou, all right?\n\n25\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.628\nSo, I'm kind of a nostalgic\ngamer of sorts, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:23.159\nI grew up, and you and I were talking,\nI grew up when arcades were still pretty\n\n27\n00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.460\nprominent, and then they started to\ntaper off as I got into my teens.\n\n28\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.180\nSo I have this weird transition where away\nfrom arcade based to really strong home\n\n29\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.170\ncounsel pc based, and arcade kinda\ndied out but it's still around.\n\n30\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.300\nBut it wasn't just prolific or\nentrenched in the culture it once was,\n\n31\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.870\nbut along with some of this\narcade games were difficult, but\n\n32\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.395\nthey were wonderful in their simplicity.\n\n33\n00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.942\nSo here's what I'm thinking.\n\n34\n00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.430\nAt mall attackers.\n\n35\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.290\nThere may be some resemblance to previous\ngames that you've played before, but\n\n36\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.820\nthose are purely coincidental.\n\n37\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.787\nI'm thinking these kind of monsters\nstart at the top right these flying kind\n\n38\n00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:06.999\nof monsters, and\nthey kind of track down the screen.\n\n39\n00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.278\nAnd then, you're the only line of defense\nwith your little fighter in the middle and\n\n40\n00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:14.540\nit moves back and forth, and\nit can shoot a variety at will.\n\n41\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.036\nLet's just say one projectile,\n\n42\n00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:21.493\nI think I can build that in\na browser.I think space bar for,\n\n43\n00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:26.143\n[SOUND] but the arrow keys for\nmoving, maybe you could do WASD.\n\n44\n00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:28.550\nYeah, WASD.\n\n45\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.320\nOr, right, you could use the mouse.\n\n46\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960\nNow, those are decisions\nto be made at a later time.\n\n47\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.248\nBut our general theme is we have the,\n[SOUND] and then you're trying to get rid\n\n48\n00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:43.737\nof all of them before they make it to you,\nand that's kind of our end condition.\n\n49\n00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:45.924\nNow, that's our minimal viable product,\n\n50\n00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:49.585\nbut I think this could be expanded\na great deal like different levels, and\n\n51\n00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:52.615\ndifferent difficulties, and\nthere's just a whole bunch.\n\n52\n00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:55.040\nBut I think that's a good\nfirst approximation.\n\n53\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.243\nAnd it really plays into some of\nthat nostalgic gaming that helps me,\n\n54\n00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:04.023\nit helps me realize that I\nwas once a child as well.\n\n55\n00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:06.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe've got our ideas, right?\n\n56\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.080\nWe kinda lets us know where we're going,\nnow where we start?\n\n57\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm a bit proponent of instead\nof diving right in to start coding and\n\n58\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.590\ncoding, we should probably make a plan,\nright?\n\n59\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.965\nAnd I like to do this and I try to\nemphasize this over some other series as\n\n60\n00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:25.137\nwell, make a plan you can deviate\nfrom it you can always change it.\n\n61\n00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.085\nBut having a plan to reference,\n\n62\n00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:31.702\na drawing what I think of as a plan is\nmostly a drawing and some annotations and\n\n63\n00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:35.220\nthings That helps you move\nforward at a reasonable pace.\n\n64\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.910\nIt also keeps you focused,\n\n65\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.540\ncuz sometimes you'll get what I\nlike to call Shiny Object Syndrome.\n\n66\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.250\nWhere you're like, I'm doing stuff that's\nshiny over there, let me go over there.\n\n67\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.590\nSo it help keeps me focused and\nhopefully it does as well.\n\n68\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.380\nBut it also let's me know I\ndidn't actually think about it.\n\n69\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.255\nSome things come to fruition.\n\n70\n00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:54.680\nAnd I'm a big proponent of drawing, right?\n\n71\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.510\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome over to the sky cam and\n\n72\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.900\nactually draw out our little game here.\n\n73\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.530\nAnd I got multicolored just cuz\nthat's how I roll, but let's see.\n\n74\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.360\nLet's say that this, the entire area,\nis the playing surface.\n\n75\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.990\nNow, this is rectangular but\nit doesn't have to be, right?\n\n76\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.659\nI can make it anything I want.\n\n77\n00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:23.013\nBut what I'm thinking is we have kinda our\nlittle swarm of atmosphere attackers here.\n\n78\n00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:29.635\nRight, and\nthen I'm thinking to start with a row.\n\n79\n00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:32.585\nBut we could make that different.\n\n80\n00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:39.285\nAnd then just to say, I'm gonna start\nwith a little kind of tank here, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:44.340\nNow, I'm representing these by squares,\nbut we could always make these images.\n\n82\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.110\nBut I'm a big proponent of saying,\nhey, let's make this simple first.\n\n83\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.380\nLet's just get the dynamics down.\n\n84\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.880\nI don't want this to be\nable to move up and down.\n\n85\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.640\nWhat I do want is, as the game time loops,\nlet me grab a different color.\n\n86\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.470\nI'm thinking these go this way, right?\n\n87\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.023\nUntil, and they could go to the left,\nthere's no magic\n\n88\n00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:18.921\nabout the right,\nuntil they hit the edge like so.\n\n89\n00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:23.160\nAnd once they hit the edge,\nI'm looking drop down, switch directions.\n\n90\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.800\nSo here's the new state, so\nthese be, how many do I have here?\n\n91\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.320\nI have five, I don't count so well.\n\n92\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.890\nAnd now, they're moving in this direction.\n\n93\n00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.830\nAnd our goal,\nas our little fighter down here,\n\n94\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.820\nis to maybe fire off things\nwe're gonna call pellets,\n\n95\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.350\nand we want to hit one of these, right?\n\n96\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.030\nSo let's say this pellet hits and\nthen goes away.\n\n97\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.780\nWe want to get rid of all of these before\nthey get to us, because the attackers win\n\n98\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.890\nif they get to the bottom, but\nwe win if we get rid of all of them.\n\n99\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.500\nNow those win conditions,\nwe could add some fancy screens.\n\n100\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.410\nBut the dynamics are kind of that, right?\n\n101\n00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.670\nNow, this is completely automated,\nthis kind of starts automatically.\n\n102\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.210\nWe have to know if\nthe attacker hits the edge.\n\n103\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.850\nAnd likewise, if it hits the edge over\nhere, it does the same action, so\n\n104\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.790\nit can hit either one.\n\n105\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.896\nIt also needs the ability to move left and\nright and down, right,\n\n106\n00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:34.806\nin a y direction, so\nit needs both y directions.\n\n107\n00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:39.300\nBut for our fighter really,\nwe only need to move left and right.\n\n108\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.830\nI don't think flying up to the attacker\nis where you can lose is a good idea.\n\n109\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.350\nSo, we're just gonna move left and right.\n\n110\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.710\nSo we need the ability to move and\nto some extent,\n\n111\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.530\nwe need the ability to fire\nlet's just call them pellets.\n\n112\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.840\nAnd then, we move left and\nright, we fire Pellets.\n\n113\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.800\nWhen it hits, it removes these.\n\n114\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.320\nNow the end game state is.\n\n115\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:14.470\nSo End Game, Is all attackers gone.\n\n116\n00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:26.280\nOr they got us, Right?\n\n117\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.590\nThey made it to the bottom and\nhit our little slider.\n\n118\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.770\nThey got us.\n\n119\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.730\n&gt;&gt; And I've noticed here,\nin part of your story boarding process and\n\n120\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.350\nplanning here, that you're worried just\nmore about the basics right now than\n\n121\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.110\nany of the complexities or\nfancying up the way it looks right now.\n\n122\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat is most definitely something that\n\n123\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.430\nI worry about first is-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n124\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Let me get the basic dynamics down.\n\n125\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.907\nLet me get the absolute, minimal,\n\n126\n00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:55.828\nviable solution before I really\nworry about any graphics.\n\n127\n00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:58.582\n&gt;&gt; And then you come back, you pick and\ntweak and fine tune it and\n\n128\n00:07:58.582 --> 00:07:59.668\nhone in whatever it is.\n\n129\n00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:01.302\nAs far as aesthetically that you want.\n\n130\n00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:03.573\n&gt;&gt; Right,\ncuz I can build simple versions fast.\n\n131\n00:08:03.573 --> 00:08:04.222\nMm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n132\n00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:07.439\nthen what I may find out is when\nI'm building up a simple version,\n\n133\n00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:11.020\nis, that doesn't work like\nI thought it was going to.\n\n134\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.580\nAnd then when it doesn't work like\nI thought is going to, I'm like,\n\n135\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.110\nI need to come back and revisit my plan.\n\n136\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.590\nAnd when I revisit my,\nI need to think about and\n\n137\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.830\nI just, that is actually\nan intuitive type of thing.\n\n138\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.640\nIf I do small pieces, and\n\n139\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.390\ndo it iteratively,\nthen I can get a better product faster.\n\n140\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.280\nNow that's just, again,\nthere are varying opinions.\n\n141\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.590\nThat has been my experience, and\n\n142\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.630\nthat seems to be the experience\na lot of individuals.\n\n143\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.710\nYour mileage may vary on that.\n\n144\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.640\nBut we can come back over to the Sky cam,\njust for\n\n145\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.850\na moment We have our end game,\nthey got us, we can move.\n\n146\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.120\nThat's all great.\n\n147\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.280\nThese can move, cool.\n\n148\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.232\nSo, they need to be able to move as well.\n\n149\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.330\nAnd you know what?\n\n150\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.820\nThese movings here,\nthese are gonna be automatic moves.\n\n151\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.300\nThe computer's kinda gonna handle those\nbut these are going to be based on users.\n\n152\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:11.120\nSo this is a user input,\na player so to speak, right?\n\n153\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.559\nSo this is a player.\n\n154\n00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:18.640\nAnd I'm gonna get input from them.\n\n155\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.260\nSo if we're taking an input from them,\n\n156\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.210\nthen we probably need some input device,\nprobably a keyboard.\n\n157\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.030\nI'm probably gonna go to keyboard, just\nbecause sometimes I'm not real good at\n\n158\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.360\ngaming on a computer with a mouse, but\nthat's again, my personal preference.\n\n159\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.990\nSo I'm thinking move left and\nright will of course bind to left and\n\n160\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.490\nright arrow keys.\n\n161\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.350\nLikewise, if I wanna fire a pellet\nI'm thinking that's Space bar.\n\n162\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.070\nAnd Space bar, move left and\nright that's all I need here.\n\n163\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.260\nI have what's gonna end the game,\nI have the dynamics of these.\n\n164\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.882\nAnd well, I think that'll get us our first\nkind of minimal reliable solution but\n\n165\n00:09:56.882 --> 00:09:59.539\nit might take a couple of iterations.\n\n166\n00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:03.039\nYou say, that's a little nicer,\na little more polished and\n\n167\n00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:07.948\nyou could go on forever for this, but we\nalways have to have a stopping condition.\n\n168\n00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:09.630\n&gt;&gt; Is this gonna be something, Justin,\n\n169\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.200\nthat we're gonna code,\njust gonna go ahead and you got your plan,\n\n170\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.060\nwe're gonna code everything at once or\nare you gonna make it more modular,\n\n171\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.930\nbreak it down into modules and\ndo it a little bit more piece by piece?\n\n172\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.160\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm thinking is,\n\n173\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.360\nour first attempt at building this,\nat what we just planned.\n\n174\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.030\nWe should only worry about\neither the attacker and\n\n175\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.330\nthe dynamics of the attacker,\nor the fighter.\n\n176\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.240\nNow my decision is I'm gonna\nbuild the fighter first.\n\n177\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.250\nI'm not even gonna worry\nabout the pellets, right?\n\n178\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.450\nBecause the pellets are technically\nanother piece of that.\n\n179\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.612\nThey're another entity on the game,\nor in the game.\n\n180\n00:10:41.612 --> 00:10:46.230\nI'm gonna build the fighter and\nthe ability to move left and right.\n\n181\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.610\nAnd make sure that the positioning and\nall of that's working.\n\n182\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.154\nAnd once I have the basic fighter\nthen I can just start tweaking.\n\n183\n00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.160\nWell, now what about\nthe fighter with pellets?\n\n184\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.763\nOkay, well, I already had the fighter,\n\n185\n00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:02.570\nI now have to focus on the pellets part,\nokay.\n\n186\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.410\nNow that we have pellets,\nwhich we may have to come back and\n\n187\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.650\ntweak, now let's build the attacker.\n\n188\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.760\nLet's build one attacker.\n\n189\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.260\nWe've got one attacker.\n\n190\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.840\nNow let's build a bunch of attackers.\n\n191\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.410\nOkay, so by doing this kind\nof incremental progression,\n\n192\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.020\nyou don't have to worry as much about,\nI don't know what I'm doing, right?\n\n193\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.300\nIt's kind of a analysis paralysis or\nan overwhelming feeling where you're like,\n\n194\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.130\nI just coded a bunch of stuff that\ndoesn't work, none of it works.\n\n195\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.820\nBut I like the small successes, if I can\nbuild fighter first, we're all good to go.\n\n196\n00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.900\nAnd in preparation of that we\nshould probably go ahead and\n\n197\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.320\nset up our project and think about\nproject structure a little bit.\n\n198\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.220\nThat's probably what\nwe're gonna do here so\n\n199\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.000\nwe can focus on the fighter\nin another episode.\n\n200\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.560\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and well,\n\n201\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.140\nwe just have the Chrome browser.\n\n202\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.540\nRight, I wanna get some basic setup,\nI want our game, a little bit of styling\n\n203\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.840\nkind of open in the page and\nthen our JavaScript, and\n\n204\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.140\nour CSS and anything we need,\nkind of set up, ready to go.\n\n205\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.350\nNow, inside of here, I have atmoattack,\nright, atmosphere attackers.\n\n206\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:13.890\nThere is nothing in this file, or\nfolder, excuse me, it's not a file.\n\n207\n00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.910\nBut if I open it up in Atom,\nnow I used atom space dot,\n\n208\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.180\nyou can always come back and\nrearrange your desktops,\n\n209\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:28.910\nbecause apparently I can't figure\nthat out, I gotta, I don't know.\n\n210\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.260\nAnyway, so you can always come back and\n\n211\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.195\nsay File &gt; Add project folder,\nif you don't have those shortcuts.\n\n212\n00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:41.130\nNow I know sometimes it works for Windows\nusers, sometimes it doesn't, I don't know.\n\n213\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.870\nAnyway you can do that but\nwe have our folder here.\n\n214\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.158\nAnd I think we're gonna go with\na relatively flat structure cuz this is in\n\n215\n00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:53.450\nbrowser and because it's in browser we're\ngonna create a new file called index.html.\n\n216\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.995\nIt's just a convention that follow,\nmy main entry point file is always\n\n217\n00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:02.342\nindex.html, I'm using\nconvention vver saying,\n\n218\n00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:07.746\nwell I'm actually gonna call it game.html\nand then if I deploy it somewhere, yeah.\n\n219\n00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:14.060\nI always use index.html, there is a little\nbit of magic to it but you don't have to,\n\n220\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.670\nespecially if you're just working\nlocally and kind of experimenting.\n\n221\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.668\nLikewise, we're gonna create our main\nentry point of the game which I'm gonna\n\n222\n00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:25.910\ncall app again,\na convention that I follow.\n\n223\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:31.350\nAnd then our main CSS,\nwell I'm just gonna call it main.css.\n\n224\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.018\nAgain, nothing special about these names,\n\n225\n00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:37.546\nyou can call them game.html,\ngame.js, and game.css.\n\n226\n00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:39.720\nAs long as you're consistent\nwith what you do it's fine.\n\n227\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:48.815\nLikewise I think that I'm gonna keep other\npieces, maybe the fighter, the attackers.\n\n228\n00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:52.535\nI'm gonna keep those in separate files,\nactually what I would call modules and\n\n229\n00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:56.630\nI'm gonna put those in folders, right?\n\n230\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.040\nWell I am gonna put them in a folder.\n\n231\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.730\nLet's create a new folder called js and\nwe're just gonna\n\n232\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.680\nleave that there cuz we're gonna focus\non the actual creation of the entities.\n\n233\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.912\nBut here's our basic project structure,\napp.js, index.html, and main.css.\n\n234\n00:14:14.912 --> 00:14:19.200\nAll right, our project structure is good.\n\n235\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.960\nWe want to make sure that our layout,\n\n236\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.130\neverything's kind of nice and\nneat on the page.\n\n237\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.840\nAnd that we have references to\nour canvas and our context.\n\n238\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.760\nAnd we're ready to go and\nactually start building the fire.\n\n239\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.590\nLet's go and make our html.\n\n240\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.109\nSo I'm gonna make html and\nwe're gonna say, AtmoAttack.\n\n241\n00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:43.459\nAnd then below that title,\nwe're gonna make a link and\n\n242\n00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:48.770\nit's not css/master.css,\nit's just main.css, all right?\n\n243\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.600\nNow, that's because it's\nin a flat file structure.\n\n244\n00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.680\nAnd then, I'm gonna say script.\n\n245\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.960\nAnd that's not what I wanted.\n\n246\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.290\nBoom but that's alright,\nwe'll make it work.\n\n247\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.258\nThese are Atom shortcuts,\nwhere you just type in and hit Enter.\n\n248\n00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:10.101\nI'm gonna say src='app.js'.\n\n249\n00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:13.370\nLikewise I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd my canvas.\n\n250\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.046\nNow my canvas is gonna be\nmy main gameplay area.\n\n251\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.620\nI'm gonna call it the screen, right?\n\n252\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.690\nWe're gonna pretend it's\nan old-school arcade screen.\n\n253\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.730\nSo I'm gonna say canvas.\n\n254\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.210\nAnd then it's gonna\nhave a class of screen.\n\n255\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:38.105\nAnd it's gonna have a width of say 600,\n\n256\n00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:42.857\nand a height of 400, like so.\n\n257\n00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:48.560\nAnd then app.js, actually let's\ngo ahead and manage the screen.\n\n258\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.030\nSo I'm thinking screen, no Siri.\n\n259\n00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.890\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n260\n00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.257\nBut the screen, let's just add a little\nbit different background color so\n\n261\n00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:59.742\nwe can actually see it,\nsee that it's there.\n\n262\n00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:02.503\nGrey.\n\n263\n00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:07.514\nAnd for the app.js,\nlet's just put working.\n\n264\n00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:13.089\nOkay, so this is a little more than\nthe basic setup that I usually do but\n\n265\n00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:15.640\nhere's our canvas.\n\n266\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.980\nCool, that's gonna be our screen.\n\n267\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.300\nWe'll do a little more JavaScript.\n\n268\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.700\nBut let's go ahead and open this up in\nChrome, make sure everything's working.\n\n269\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.530\nBecause I made that full screen,\nIt rearranged my desktops again.\n\n270\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.290\nI do enjoy this.\n\n271\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.735\nThere we go.\n\n272\n00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:34.680\nNow, I could open it through the command\nline or just have it open in Chrome.\n\n273\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.380\nBut let's go to Open file.\n\n274\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.240\nAnd if we come back out into\nthis containing folder.\n\n275\n00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.140\nLet's go find it.\n\n276\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.470\nAnd here we go, index.html.\n\n277\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.590\nAnd there's our screen.\n\n278\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:54.190\nNow, it's kind of a tiny screen,\nbut I tend to zoom things in so\n\n279\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.410\neverybody could see, so\nI'm gonna keep it fairly tiny, so\n\n280\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.920\nthere might be some skewing and\nthings, so do keep that in mind.\n\n281\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.230\nI'm gonna go ahead and open up this\nterminal, and it is working, and\n\n282\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.940\nbecause this is gray background,\nour CSS and or JavaScript are linked.\n\n283\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.530\nAnd before we kind of finish up,\n\n284\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.240\nbefore moving onto the fighter,\nlet's go ahead and grab our screen.\n\n285\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.920\nNow I usually call this canvas, but\n\n286\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.660\nsometimes I wanna use the same variable\nnames, because they make sense.\n\n287\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.213\nI'm afraid that people think those\nvariables are magic, but they're not.\n\n288\n00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.384\nSo I'm gonna say screen.\n\n289\n00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:35.677\nSo the screen is the canvas but\nit's gonna be the screen of our game and\n\n290\n00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:40.694\nthen I'm gonna go ahead and\nmake the context and that is going to be\n\n291\n00:17:40.694 --> 00:17:46.560\nthe screen.getContext('2d'), like so\nand have that out of the way.\n\n292\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.130\nAnd now if we console.log(screen).\n\n293\n00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.770\nWe just want to make sure\nthese are not undefined.\n\n294\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.820\nNot undefined,\ndoes that classify as a double negative?\n\n295\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.876\nI'm not sure if it does or not.\n\n296\n00:17:58.876 --> 00:18:01.140\nWe're just gonna go with it, right?\n\n297\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.840\nSo there's our screen,\nwhich is a Canvas element, and\n\n298\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.540\nhere's our Canvas rendering context.\n\n299\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.440\nSo we're good go, we're ready to move\non to making the fighter, right?\n\n300\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.227\nBut I wanna make sure that we have\nthe appropriate time to go through,\n\n301\n00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:18.900\nhow am I designing further?\n\n302\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.730\nWhat are the thought processes\nthat I have when building\n\n303\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.440\nan entity that is gonna be represented\nbecause I just don't wanna draw shapes.\n\n304\n00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.170\nI actually wanna have an in-memory\nrepresentation of the fighter,\n\n305\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.050\nthat way you can manipulate, and\n\n306\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.860\nthe only thing you're seeing is\nthe actual rendered portion.\n\n307\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.600\nSo, Wes, we're ready to start\ncreating our basic fighter.\n\n308\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.480\nOur initial project set up is done,\nI think we're good to go.\n\n309\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, great job setting\nup that project structure.\n\n310\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.040\nI can't wait to see you implement\nthe game as well, and the fighter.\n\n311\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.790\nJustin, before we sign out,\ndo you have any additional, maybe,\n\n312\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.960\nwords of wisdom or piece of advice you'd\nlike to give somebody when it comes to\n\n313\n00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.770\nfinding their project?\n\n314\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:59.430\n&gt;&gt; I would definitely say, minimal, viable\nsolution, and work incrementally, right?\n\n315\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.660\nBuild a small piece, and I'm gonna try\nto model that throughout this project.\n\n316\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.960\nBuild a small piece, make sure it works.\n\n317\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.800\nThe worst thing you can do is build\na whole bunch of pieces, then go test and\n\n318\n00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.160\nthen if something's broken, you're like,\nwas it the fighters, the attackers,\n\n319\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.820\nthe pellets?\n\n320\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.330\nIs it the screen, is it, I don't know.\n\n321\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.880\nIt's really hard to debug if you\nbuild a whole bunch of stuff at once.\n\n322\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.610\nBut now if we only build the fighter and\ndo a single interaction with the fighter?\n\n323\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.700\nThe left button doesn't work.\n\n324\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.150\nI only have a couple of places I need to\nlook because the left button doesn't work.\n\n325\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.670\nThat's just an example, I don't think\nthe left button is not gonna work.\n\n326\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.510\nWho knows?\n\n327\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.820\nWe'll figure it out but small pieces,\n\n328\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.710\nminimal viable solution and\nthen just keep trekking forward.\n\n329\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.830\nThat's our ultimate goal.\n\n330\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.500\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ngreat information there Justin.\n\n331\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.420\nDoes look like we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up but keep in mind we got\n\n332\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:52.240\na lot more great content here at DevProTV\nincluding more HTML5 Canvas Projects but\n\n333\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.030\nthat's gonna require you the viewer\ncoming back and joining us.\n\n334\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.400\nUntil we see you, signing out for\nDevProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n335\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n336\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.968\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n337\n00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:05.539\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.602\nWelcome back to DevPro.TV as we\nare continuing our journey through HTML 5\n\n4\n00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:20.590\ncanvas projects.\n\n5\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.570\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.030\nJustin how are you doing, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.770\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\n\n8\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.360\nI'm kinda itching to get ready\ninto this realm of nostalgia.\n\n9\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.310\nBut more importantly Wes,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Man, I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.340\nIn the last episode or\nin the past episode,\n\n12\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.510\nyou showed us how to bring\nthat project some structure.\n\n13\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.820\nAnd in that episode, if you are not\nfamiliar with it, turn back over and\n\n14\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490\nwatch it, they are planning the project.\n\n15\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.120\nHe showed us that we were going to\nbasically be creating a fighter,\n\n16\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.400\ncreating the basic fighter.\n\n17\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.770\nSo Justin,\nwhat do you say we get this train rolling?\n\n18\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.870\nWe jump in and, where do we start\nwhen it comes to implementing that?\n\n19\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when I say basic fighter,\n\n20\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.190\nI'm talking like Lego,\nbuild a block fighter.\n\n21\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.810\nAs a matter of fact,\nit's gonna be so basic, it's more or\n\n22\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.870\nless gonna be a rectangle.\n\n23\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.070\n&gt;&gt; So you've seen my drawing capabilities\neventually, so I'm in the right show.\n\n24\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n25\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.514\nI had to be careful of not bringing\nin my crayons so I could draw.\n\n26\n00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.690\nWell, so we're in the same boat,\nWes, we're in the same boat.\n\n27\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.000\nNow, along with the representation\non the screen, right,\n\n28\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.730\nwhat we actually see when we play a game.\n\n29\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.460\nTypically, there's a lot of\ndata backing that up, right?\n\n30\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.670\nWhat is its position, what are its\ncapabilities, what are its methods?\n\n31\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.300\nWe need to know a bunch of stuff, right?\n\n32\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.050\nWell, okay, all right.\n\n33\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.130\nWe need to know a bunch of stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.420\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily,\nthose are kind of separate, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.300\nWhat is rendered, and\nI need to know a bunch of stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.307\nSo as a result,\n\n37\n00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:53.835\nwe're going to create a very basic\nfighter as far as rendering goes.\n\n38\n00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:57.658\nBut we really need to focus on what\ndata are we going to need, and\n\n39\n00:01:57.658 --> 00:01:59.720\nthat is going to be in flux.\n\n40\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.150\nAnd what I want to do initially is\nkind of build this all in one file.\n\n41\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.370\nKeep it reorganized as we need to,\nand that's a structure that I use.\n\n42\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.201\nSo you're not flipping between\nfiles as you're exploring,\n\n43\n00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.970\ntrying to figure things out.\n\n44\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580\nSo there's enough talk in there.\n\n45\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100\nLet's go ahead and try this out.\n\n46\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.410\nLet's take a look at my screen here, and\nthis is where we left off last time.\n\n47\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.000\nI did use a little bit different names for\nthis.\n\n48\n00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840\nMainly because I wanna make sure\npeople don't think those variable\n\n49\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.020\nnames are magic.\n\n50\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.050\nSo here is our game area,\nright, our screen.\n\n51\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.500\nAnd really what I want is the ability\nto render a fighter on the screen.\n\n52\n00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.780\nBut I also want the fighter to move up and\ndown now.\n\n53\n00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:48.906\nIn order to render it,\nI need the ability to know where it is,\n\n54\n00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.890\nwhat is its size, right?\n\n55\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.485\nAnd x and y position, what is its size?\n\n56\n00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:56.733\nAnd then the fighter itself is going\nto have the ability to mutate certain\n\n57\n00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.084\nattributes about itself,\nmainly what is its position?\n\n58\n00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:04.054\nWell, when you move, you're actually\nchanging your position when you move.\n\n59\n00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:09.720\nSo there's some tweaking in there, but\nlet's go ahead and build our fighter.\n\n60\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.290\nNow, I'm building a Fighter using a class.\n\n61\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.880\nThis is going to allow me to construct\na bunch of Fighters if I need to.\n\n62\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Justin do we have to use class?\n\n63\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.730\nHelp me out with that, or is there another\nway that we can actually accomplish this?\n\n64\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.506\n&gt;&gt; So in JavaScript classes\nare a relatively new advent.\n\n65\n00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:30.727\nIt's actually kinda syntactic sugar\non top of the prototype chain and\n\n66\n00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:32.310\nconstructor functions.\n\n67\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.248\nWe can really, if you have no idea what\nI'm talking about definitely go check out\n\n68\n00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:38.831\nour other courses in the library.\n\n69\n00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:42.190\nI talk about JavaScript\nfairly extensively.\n\n70\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.870\nBut I think this helps with some of\nthe organizations, some of the syntax.\n\n71\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.850\nYou could build this as\na function that returns objects.\n\n72\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.111\nYou could build this as a prototype chain,\naddition to a constructor function,\n\n73\n00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.883\nwhich is actually this is\nthe syntactic sugar on it.\n\n74\n00:03:55.883 --> 00:04:00.002\nBut because people were so\nfamiliar with class-based hierarchies and\n\n75\n00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:03.100\nbuilding objects from classes,\nthis is available.\n\n76\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.900\nNow, I'm gonna start here\njust to add some spice,\n\n77\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.450\nto use some uniform syntax and\nit's a little nicer.\n\n78\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.310\nThis does not work in older browsers,\nso you have to be careful there.\n\n79\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.342\nYou would have to have some kind of\ntransformation pipeline using Babble, or\n\n80\n00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:19.840\nthat setup's really hard.\n\n81\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.017\nIf you have a newer Node, or\nexcuse me, a newer Chrome or\n\n82\n00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:27.320\nMozilla Firefox, any of those\nclasses are typically supported.\n\n83\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.086\nNow what we'll do is we'll build\nthis in class, and you know what,\n\n84\n00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:33.282\nI may just go back and change these out.\n\n85\n00:04:33.282 --> 00:04:40.760\nJust so everybody has some niceness to\nsee, or at least to maybe follow up with.\n\n86\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.010\nHere are the two differences.\n\n87\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.170\nHere's how you can do this.\n\n88\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.037\nSo here's our constructor,\nand now a constructor is,\n\n89\n00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:51.380\nwhat are you expecting something\nto pass in, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.911\nI want x and y initially,\nthat's all I need,\n\n91\n00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.520\nI need to know where it's positioned,\nokay?\n\n92\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.318\nAnd that's gonna be this.x = x.\n\n93\n00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:05.685\nI'm taking the this context cuz that\nmeans whenever I create this object,\n\n94\n00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:11.064\nI'm going to set this object x equal to\nwhatever the x is that was passed in.\n\n95\n00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:13.773\nAnd you'll see that in just a moment,\nand then, this.y = y.\n\n96\n00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:18.380\nNow that's going to help me position\nthe fighter on the screen, that's fine.\n\n97\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.860\nIt does not help me render the fighter,\nright?\n\n98\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.215\nI need to know its size, or\nits width, and its height.\n\n99\n00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:27.210\nAnd we may have some changes there where,\n\n100\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.269\nthat's one of those influx things that we\nwant everything to be symmetric, right?\n\n101\n00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.350\nIs it always going to be square?\n\n102\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.058\nIs it always going to be rectangular,\nwhat is it going to be?\n\n103\n00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:38.566\nI think I'm going to start with a width.\n\n104\n00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:44.036\nLet's just say,\n10 pixels and then a height.\n\n105\n00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:46.618\nNow keep in mind I'm setting pixels here.\n\n106\n00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:50.321\nBut in all actuality this\nis one of those things, so\n\n107\n00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.520\nit's gonna be as twice\nas high as it is wide.\n\n108\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.625\nThis is one of those things that if\nyou're scaling your canvas is different,\n\n109\n00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:58.581\nit's not right.\n\n110\n00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.802\nSo here is our fighter,\nthere it is, beautiful.\n\n111\n00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:05.360\nIf we come here and look though.\n\n112\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.120\nSo let's say we have a fighter.\n\n113\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.860\nLet's just make sure that we\nconstruct it well, new fighter.\n\n114\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.324\nAnd I'm just going to place it at (100,\n100).\n\n115\n00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:23.600\nNow that's what I'm passing in,\nthis x and this y here.\n\n116\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.352\nThese 100s are actually\nbeing passed in x and y.\n\n117\n00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.781\nLet's console.log out,\n\n118\n00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.600\nactually we don't have to because we\nhave this in the global namespace.\n\n119\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.560\nLet's look at the fighter,\nthere's our fighter.\n\n120\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.270\nSo our fighter is a fighter object.\n\n121\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.923\nAnd it has a height of 20, a width of 10,\nand then x and y position, right?\n\n122\n00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:48.510\nThere it is, we've constructed\nour fighter, that's pretty nice.\n\n123\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.456\nNow before I move on, Wes asked a question\nabout, hey, is this the only way?\n\n124\n00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.801\nLet me show you the alternative just so\nyou know.\n\n125\n00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:03.510\nAnd then we'll back off and well,\nwe won't worry about that anymore.\n\n126\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.428\nSo I'm just gonna comment this out,\nboom, done.\n\n127\n00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:15.323\nI'm gonna say function Fighter(x,\n\n128\n00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:18.821\ny) and this.x = x and\n\n129\n00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:23.620\nthis.y = y, just like that.\n\n130\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.420\nLet's see what we get.\n\n131\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.140\nWell, I also forgot,\nI need to hardcode that width and height.\n\n132\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.350\nJust like so.\n\n133\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.440\nSo if I refresh and I look at fighter.\n\n134\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.620\nNope, that is not,\nI don't want the capital F Fighter,\n\n135\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.680\nI want the the regular fighter.\n\n136\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.160\nThere we go, we get the exact same thing,\n\n137\n00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.665\nbecause that constructor portion of\nthe class is kind of just syntactic sugar.\n\n138\n00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:56.267\nIt really does this behind the scenes,\nbecause this is how JavaScript was\n\n139\n00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.780\noriginally kind of used\nto construct new objects.\n\n140\n00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.978\nThere's There's a whole\nbunch of dynamics there.\n\n141\n00:08:00.978 --> 00:08:07.140\nNow likewise, I can add additional methods\nand behaviors inside of this class.\n\n142\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.980\nI can do the exact same thing here,\nin almost exactly the same way.\n\n143\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.269\nSo this is one of those other things,\nif I only needed one,\n\n144\n00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:16.635\nI would just do this as an object literal.\n\n145\n00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:20.760\nAnd I've actually done that fairly, or\njust as a function that returns an object.\n\n146\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.010\nI've done that in previous projects,\nso definitely go check those out.\n\n147\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.933\nSo this is a little bit different way,\nbut to each their own, right,\n\n148\n00:08:26.933 --> 00:08:30.127\npick one that you like and\nyou can stay consistent with.\n\n149\n00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:32.146\nI always like to switch\nit up a little bit,\n\n150\n00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:35.810\nespecially when I'm doing explorations or\njust kinda for fun projects.\n\n151\n00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.540\nSo I'm gonna remove that and, well,\nWes, I told you, we're gonna be\n\n152\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.890\ncreating a basic fighter, and\nkinda kept up with my end of the bargain.\n\n153\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, kinda here,\nyou have all the attributes of a fighter,\n\n154\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.400\nlooks like we have all the attributes.\n\n155\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.930\nBut one of the things I noticed is,\nwell, what I didn't notice is,\n\n156\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.460\nI couldn't see it,\nhow do we actually see the fighter now?\n\n157\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.369\n&gt;&gt; Well, you called me out Wes,\nI'm not gonna lie,\n\n158\n00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.644\nI was hoping you would look over that,\nbut you didn't.\n\n159\n00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:04.440\nYou didn't, right, we don't, what is\na fighter, and here's what I'm thinking.\n\n160\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.540\nI'm thinking all the entities on our\n\n161\n00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:11.590\nattacker game have to have some way to\nrender to the screen, how they're viewed.\n\n162\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:17.430\nAnd then, I've seen people call this\nshow or draw, I tend to call it render.\n\n163\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.300\nThat's how my mind works, but\nyou can name them anything.\n\n164\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.018\nAnd if they all implement that method,\nthen they should be all able to be drawn\n\n165\n00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:28.370\nonto the canvas, okay, or\nthe screen, in this case.\n\n166\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.703\nSo, let's go ahead and\nget that render method, so Wes isn't like,\n\n167\n00:09:31.703 --> 00:09:32.631\nI don't, [SOUND].\n\n168\n00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:34.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n169\n00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:38.083\ncome back to my screen here, and here's\nour fighter, here's our constructor.\n\n170\n00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:41.581\nAnd then we're just gonna\nadd a render method,\n\n171\n00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.260\nthis render method,\nI could do a few things here.\n\n172\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:52.027\nThis render method,\nI have a constructor, okay,\n\n173\n00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:59.112\nI could pass in the context upon creation,\nor the canvas upon creation.\n\n174\n00:09:59.112 --> 00:10:03.876\nBut what I think is a little bit easier is\njust to pass the screen's drawing context,\n\n175\n00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:08.740\nthink of it as the pin, every time I\ncall render on a particular object.\n\n176\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.881\nAnd what this is gonna do is say\ncontext.save, now I'm always going to\n\n177\n00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:16.756\ndo this save and restore,\na lot of times, even if I don't need it.\n\n178\n00:10:16.756 --> 00:10:21.919\nJust because it doesn't hurt anything\nif I do it, maybe other than\n\n179\n00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:27.290\na mild performance issue,\nwe're talking minuscule performance.\n\n180\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.890\nBut also, it keeps me from accidentally\nchanging colors and things and\n\n181\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.030\ngetting weird color.\n\n182\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.307\nAll of my sprites or all of my entities\non the screen becoming the same color.\n\n183\n00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:39.233\nBut, here we go,\n\n184\n00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:45.870\nwe have context.fillRect(this.x,\n\n185\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.163\nthis.y, this.width,\n\n186\n00:10:50.163 --> 00:10:57.300\nthis.height), just like so, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.220\nNow, this render function\nis gonna be different for\n\n188\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.480\nall of the entities, depending on whether\nthey look the same or they don't.\n\n189\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.570\nWe're going to see something very\ninteresting here in just a moment,\n\n190\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.390\nI think.\n\n191\n00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.687\nFirst off, you need to render the fighter,\nso fighter.\n\n192\n00:11:15.567 --> 00:11:20.221\n.render(context), right,\nI'm passing in the context\n\n193\n00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.427\nfrom up here into the render function,\nso it can draw.\n\n194\n00:11:24.427 --> 00:11:28.962\nAnd hey, there's a fighter, Wes,\nI told you I would get it there,\n\n195\n00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:32.156\nit's kind of tiny,\nit's kind of wicked tiny.\n\n196\n00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:36.472\nAnd that's because this 10 and\n20 are relatively small,\n\n197\n00:11:36.472 --> 00:11:41.121\ngiven the 800-something,\nnow we can tweak this, right, but\n\n198\n00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:48.331\nI'm thinking, Let's just tweak\nit in time now, let's keep,\n\n199\n00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.830\nactually, let's keep this about 10,\nbut let's make this height about 40.\n\n200\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.940\nI come back and I refresh, there we go,\n\n201\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.860\nnow, it's way over there,\nit's not actually positioned.\n\n202\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.020\nWhat I'm thinking is,\nit should be positioned down here, and\n\n203\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.990\nnow that we can see it,\nwe can see that it's in the wrong place.\n\n204\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.364\nSo here's our fighter, and\n\n205\n00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:13.558\nour fighter should really be probably\nin the center of the canvas.\n\n206\n00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:18.037\nSo canvas.width/2,\nthis is gonna be pretty close,\n\n207\n00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:22.052\nnot exact, and\nthen canvas.height minus what?\n\n208\n00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:29.192\nMinus the height, and that's to make\nsure I pull it back to the height.\n\n209\n00:12:29.192 --> 00:12:31.520\nSo that's gonna be 40, now,\nI have some hardcoded values there,\n\n210\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.850\nI'd prefer to leave them there for\nnow, but that's, in general, not good.\n\n211\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.860\nCanvas, I've been so\nused to using that name, it's the screen,\n\n212\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.990\nit's the screen, in this case.\n\n213\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.720\nSo boom, there's our fighter, so our\nfighter's at the bottom, it's ready to go.\n\n214\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.546\nAnd we kinda have our basic\nfighter entered in the screen.\n\n215\n00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:54.370\nThere's one thing I wanna talk about,\nthough, by default, this is black.\n\n216\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.920\nThat's the default fill rect,\nthat's the default context.\n\n217\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.860\nIt almost seems like I should be able to\ncreate fighters with maybe a color, right?\n\n218\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.360\nMaybe I have different, especially if\nyou wanna make a two player game, right?\n\n219\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.730\nWes and I both wanted to play,\nif we're both the same color fighters,\n\n220\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.675\nthen there's no determination between\nwho's what, that can be difficult.\n\n221\n00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:18.700\nWell,playing it on a single\ncomputer can be difficult anyway,\n\n222\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.770\nbut we need some way to break those out.\n\n223\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.850\nSo let's come back into the screen here,\nand\n\n224\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.550\njust do a quick little tweak to\nmake it a little more customizable.\n\n225\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.560\nAnd you'll see that this actually leads\nto some other things in the future.\n\n226\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.550\nSo I'm gonna say,\nwe're gonna pass on a color,\n\n227\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.587\nokay, and then this.color = color.\n\n228\n00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:44.322\nBut I really want this to be optional,\n\n229\n00:13:44.322 --> 00:13:49.970\nI really want this to have a default\nvalue if someone doesn't use it.\n\n230\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.479\nNow, in new JavaScript, I can do\nsomething like this, I can actually give\n\n231\n00:13:55.479 --> 00:14:01.176\ndefault values to parameters, right,\nwhat's your favorite color, Wes?\n\n232\n00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:01.761\n&gt;&gt; Purple.\n\n233\n00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:06.435\n&gt;&gt; Purple, all right, let's go with,\nI think purple is a CSS color,\n\n234\n00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:08.240\nwe're about to find out.\n\n235\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.973\nIf not, we'll find a purple and\nget it there anyway, so\n\n236\n00:14:12.973 --> 00:14:20.564\nin order to see that kind of work, we're\ngonna say context.fillStyle = this.color.\n\n237\n00:14:20.564 --> 00:14:27.380\nAnd I'm actually gonna console.log\nthe fighter here because\n\n238\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.150\nI put that purple in place And\nthat should be the default argument.\n\n239\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.538\nIf I come back and I refresh, purple is\nthe default argument, and look at that.\n\n240\n00:14:36.538 --> 00:14:41.030\nWe have a purple fighter, this is\nalmost like it's customized for Wes.\n\n241\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.807\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; But that's all right, because now,\n\n242\n00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:44.317\neven though we have that default argument.\n\n243\n00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:50.310\nIf I wanted to come back here and\nsay red, then now it's a red fighter.\n\n244\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.650\nSo we have that little bit of tweaking and\nI think, that's optional, that's good.\n\n245\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.838\nAnd that would help delineate between,\nis this a fighter, is this an entity,\n\n246\n00:15:00.838 --> 00:15:01.604\nwhat is this?\n\n247\n00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:06.123\nIf you adopt a color scheme for\nyour particular game aspect or\n\n248\n00:15:06.123 --> 00:15:11.370\nwhatever, so that's my plan,\nmay not necessarily be yours.\n\n249\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.350\nSo we have our color fighter, and\nWes, does this look a fighter to you?\n\n250\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.763\n&gt;&gt; Well, it kinda looks like a fighter,\na little bit more like a rectangle,\n\n251\n00:15:19.763 --> 00:15:20.555\nif you will.\n\n252\n00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:23.003\nSo it does look like we have\nthe basic fighter, but well,\n\n253\n00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:24.330\nnow we need it to move, right?\n\n254\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.640\nCuz if it's just a sitting duck here,\nit doesn't look like our Atmo Attackers\n\n255\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.207\nare gonna have too much\nproblem taking it out.\n\n256\n00:15:31.207 --> 00:15:34.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I think you're right, so if\nit just stands still, you gotta wait for\n\n257\n00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:35.594\nthem to come to you.\n\n258\n00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:36.591\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that may not\n\n259\n00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.934\nnecessarily be the best\nstrategy in the game.\n\n260\n00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:42.962\nSo I think initial first pass,\nand we may refactor this later,\n\n261\n00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:45.242\nchange this out, is get the left and\n\n262\n00:15:45.242 --> 00:15:50.430\nright arrow keys to actually move\nthis thing left and right, right?\n\n263\n00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.202\nSo I think we might have time to get\nthat done, it seems like a lot of work.\n\n264\n00:15:54.202 --> 00:15:56.920\nI mean it's probably not.\n\n265\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.140\nLet's go over here and so\nhere is our fighter, right?\n\n266\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:08.100\nAnd our fighter will, let's see.\n\n267\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.180\nWe're gonna simulate this.\n\n268\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.880\nI'm gonna simulate because we don't\nhave any drawing or rendering or\n\n269\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.480\nanything like that.\n\n270\n00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:23.738\nLet's set up our\nwindow.addEventListener and\n\n271\n00:16:23.738 --> 00:16:25.836\nhere we go.\n\n272\n00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:31.340\nWe wanna listen for\nkeydown events, and listen for e.\n\n273\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.006\nNow I'm listening on the windows that\nway when you focus in you get it.\n\n274\n00:16:35.006 --> 00:16:41.699\nThat e on a keydown is gonna have\nan interesting attribute and\n\n275\n00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:47.020\nI just recently found out,\nthat see this code?\n\n276\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.405\nThat's space.\n\n277\n00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:52.953\nThe key is actually a space character and\nthen a keyCode is 32.\n\n278\n00:16:52.953 --> 00:16:57.910\nI've always used keyCode, but\nI just read in some documentation.\n\n279\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.740\nThey actually recommend not to do this.\n\n280\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.839\nIt's still there, people still do it but\nI think it's going away.\n\n281\n00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.787\nThey say you should use key, because key\n\n282\n00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:14.440\nright arrow, key is actually arrow right.\n\n283\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.060\nIt's a description instead of some\nweird number that you have to look\n\n284\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.980\nup every time.\n\n285\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.120\nSo I kind of like that change,\nand for this project,\n\n286\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.170\neven though I've been key code a bunch of\nother times, I'm gonna go with key here.\n\n287\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.090\nSo I think left and right arrow, it\nwould be nice if we could just get maybe\n\n288\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:35.170\na print out of the fighter, and\nactually seeing moving of the fighter.\n\n289\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.330\nSo let's say, when we get this passed in,\n\n290\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:46.210\nI want to immediately grab the key,\nthe key off of the event.\n\n291\n00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.683\nAnd I'm just gonna do a switch statement\nbecause I know I'm gonna have to handle\n\n292\n00:17:51.683 --> 00:17:52.809\nseveral keys here.\n\n293\n00:17:52.809 --> 00:17:58.825\nAnd that's a case ofArrowRight,\n\n294\n00:17:58.825 --> 00:18:03.810\nBreak, case of ArrowLeft.\n\n295\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.594\nBreak and then you should always\nhave the default case, but\n\n296\n00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:11.888\nwe're not gonna put anything in there.\n\n297\n00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:18.687\nAnd then every time,\nI'm just gonna console.log the fighter\n\n298\n00:18:21.532 --> 00:18:24.940\nOkay, so\nhere's our console.log the fighter.\n\n299\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.060\nAnd well, let's just see if that\nconsole.log the fighter works,\n\n300\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.540\nbecause the fighter is defined here,\nand this is, it's kinda weird.\n\n301\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.300\nSo if I write, there's a fighter,\nfighter, fighter.\n\n302\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.790\nAnd that's because that key\nevent doesn't actually hit\n\n303\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.990\nuntil everything is rendered in\nthe fighter variable's name.\n\n304\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.946\nSo even though they're out of order,\nthat's because that function doesn't run\n\n305\n00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:50.885\ntill I have a key event which\nis not necessarily on page load.\n\n306\n00:18:50.885 --> 00:18:53.099\nBut that's doesn't move, but\n\n307\n00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:57.750\nwe do have the ability to listen\nto error right and error left.\n\n308\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:04.024\nSo what I'm thinking for the fighter,\nI would like to have like fighter.move.\n\n309\n00:19:04.024 --> 00:19:06.720\nAnd I could do move right, move left but\nI could even give it a mount.\n\n310\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.497\nMove to the right and then mount would be\nmore or less the velocity that it would\n\n311\n00:19:12.497 --> 00:19:15.640\nhave every time you click or\nevery time you hit a move error.\n\n312\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.700\nSo, I'm thinking moving to\nthe right would be positive.\n\n313\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:25.330\nSo I'm move 5 and then fighter move -5.\n\n314\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.130\nSo this would be symmetric, okay.\n\n315\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.910\nThere we go, I think that will work.\n\n316\n00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:37.363\nIf we come back,\nwe hit fighter.move is not a function.\n\n317\n00:19:37.363 --> 00:19:40.986\nI was trying to use a function\nthat does not exist.\n\n318\n00:19:40.986 --> 00:19:46.990\nWell fighter.move, I like that API, but\nit doesn't exist on the fighter object.\n\n319\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.507\nWell let's make it.\n\n320\n00:19:48.507 --> 00:19:51.596\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nwe're gonna move by an amount, and\n\n321\n00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:55.580\nbecause this is a fighter object,\nwe're only going to affect the X.\n\n322\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.603\nNot the Y, but just the X.\n\n323\n00:19:57.603 --> 00:20:02.294\nSo I'm gonna type this.x += amount.\n\n324\n00:20:02.294 --> 00:20:07.299\nAnd by adopting this convention, I'm\nsaying the amount is going to also give me\n\n325\n00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:13.040\na direction in a positive or negative and\nlet me know, right, left or right.\n\n326\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.000\nI'm not gonna make that\ndetermination inside of the method.\n\n327\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.200\nIt's just gonna say, you told me to move.\n\n328\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.910\nWe're good, okay?\n\n329\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.367\nSo if we come back and refresh and\nwe click over here, there's our left,\n\n330\n00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:25.270\nthere's our left, there's our left,\nthere's our left.\n\n331\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.828\nYou'll notice 295, 290, 285,\n\n332\n00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:32.215\n280, we are actually moving\nthe attributes, the x values to the left.\n\n333\n00:20:32.215 --> 00:20:35.239\nIf we go right, right, right, right,\nright, right,right, right and\n\n334\n00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:37.308\nthose are going up, so\nit does move left and right.\n\n335\n00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:41.880\nBut see, Wes has got a [INAUDIBLE]\nthere is something you\n\n336\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.170\ndon't like about the SOS, what is it?\n\n337\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.430\n&gt;&gt; It's still stationary.\n\n338\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.850\nWe're still a sitting duck.\n\n339\n00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the attributes are moving,\n\n340\n00:20:50.692 --> 00:20:55.690\nall right, they're changing but the actual\nrendered portion is not changing.\n\n341\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.160\nAnd why is that?\n\n342\n00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.950\nWell if we come over here and we look,\nwe only rendered the fighter one time.\n\n343\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.239\nAnd we could do something like this.\n\n344\n00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:12.041\nAnd instead of rendering, or excuse me,\ninstead of just console logging\n\n345\n00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:17.310\nthe fighter, we'll just render\nthe fighter inside of the event listener.\n\n346\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.330\nSo every time we move, it's gonna add.\n\n347\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.410\nAnd we're gonna have a weirdness here,\nbut that's all right.\n\n348\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.030\nAnd okay?\n\n349\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.690\nWhy is that?\n\n350\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.290\nWell, we made a bunch of them.\n\n351\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.260\nMade a bunch of fighters.\n\n352\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.430\nAnd if I go this way,\nit come back over here on this side.\n\n353\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.110\nWell, we're leaving a trail.\n\n354\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.440\nWe're not clearing the screen.\n\n355\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:46.636\nSo let's say every time we say clear at,\n0,\n\n356\n00:21:46.636 --> 00:21:53.426\n0, screen.width, screen.height.\n\n357\n00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:55.510\nSo I'm just gonna clear the screen,\nrefresh.\n\n358\n00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.120\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n359\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.920\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n360\n00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.520\nSo we have kind of our basic fighter.\n\n361\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.680\nOne final thing.\n\n362\n00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.818\nIf we were to do it like this,\nwe would have to call render to start,\n\n363\n00:22:07.818 --> 00:22:10.227\nto get the initial position rendered,\n\n364\n00:22:10.227 --> 00:22:14.539\nbecause the only time it's gonna\nrender is when I move the first time.\n\n365\n00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:17.830\nBut now on page refresh,\nwe would actually get that.\n\n366\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.950\nAnd we're able to move.\n\n367\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.223\nBut now I've nailed down the dynamics,\nI'm not saying this is the best way to\n\n368\n00:22:24.223 --> 00:22:27.339\nimplement actual rendering\nof the fighter and moving.\n\n369\n00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:30.925\nBut I have my positioning,\nI have my movement,\n\n370\n00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:34.800\nkind of my initial API which\nis starting to change.\n\n371\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.260\nBut I think we have all the aspects to now\nwhere are about some of the other entities\n\n372\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.080\nas well as setting up\nthat the game itself.\n\n373\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.424\nWell disclosure, I'm not recommending you\ncall render on something you're changing\n\n374\n00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:48.335\ninside of event listener every time.\n\n375\n00:22:48.335 --> 00:22:53.162\nIt's probably best you get smoother\nanimations by doing that somewhere else\n\n376\n00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:54.655\nand so I have to do that.\n\n377\n00:22:54.655 --> 00:22:57.818\nBut we have our initial fighter\nkind of lay down as far as data and\n\n378\n00:22:57.818 --> 00:23:01.879\nthen the basic method as necessarily, to\nget it on the screen and provide a little\n\n379\n00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:05.450\nbit of an interaction and that was\nour ultimate goal for this episode.\n\n380\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, Justin, great job getting\nthat fighter up on the screen and\n\n381\n00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.150\ngetting even some of\nthe basic movements going.\n\n382\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.020\nIt does look like we are coming to\nthe end of another great episode here.\n\n383\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.810\nBut before we do, do you have any parting\nwords that you would like to impart to\n\n384\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.400\nthe viewers that are watching right now?\n\n385\n00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, as you can see that\nthis is very simple, right?\n\n386\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.210\nBut if something goes wrong, just like\nwe saw a couple times in this episode,\n\n387\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.720\nI had an error or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n388\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.690\nI didn't have to go looking all over\nthe place for it, because I was so\n\n389\n00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.950\nfocused on an individual piece,\nmy debugging time was reduced drastically.\n\n390\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.220\nIf I had built the fighter, the entity,\nor excuse me, the fighter, the attacker,\n\n391\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.800\nthe swarm of attackers, and all of the\npellets before I ever hit refresh, man,\n\n392\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.390\nthat would have been a nightmare.\n\n393\n00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.500\nLike what if, all right?\n\n394\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.540\nAnd the worst thing is,\nthose can have cascading issues.\n\n395\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.440\n&gt;&gt; You get a bug.\n\n396\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.530\nYou fix it, and then you find out\nthere's actually a bug after that,\n\n397\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.340\nthat wasn't showing up because JavaScript,\n\n398\n00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.400\nit kinda jump ship whenever\nsomething happens, right?\n\n399\n00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.970\nMove is not a function,\nit would stop there, and\n\n400\n00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.630\nthen anything after\nthere that wouldn't run.\n\n401\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.090\nSo this is a good first approximation,\nit's very focused, very small, and\n\n402\n00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.990\nnow we can layer on a little bit more,\nbut it allows us to think about it.\n\n403\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.910\nBut continuously throughout the series,\nI'm gonna clean up, refactor,\n\n404\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:24.240\ngonna get things working, but always make\nkinda incremental advancements and that's\n\n405\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.740\nhow you should think about projects that\nyou're trying to undertake for yourself.\n\n406\n00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.970\n&gt;&gt; All right great job, Justin.\n\n407\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.860\nAs always, I look forward to seeing\nthe next iteration of Tackers here.\n\n408\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.570\nKeep in mind that we've got plenty of\ngreat content in the DevPro library as\n\n409\n00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.850\nwell as this episode and more.\n\n410\n00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.800\nHTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n411\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.500\nTill we see you again, signing out for\nDevPro.TV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n412\n00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n413\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.080\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n414\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.507\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I feel like I should have\na cohort of wizards, and angels, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.460\nstuff the way we're showing the way.\n\n11\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.073\nI'm like, let's go,\nwe're going on a journey.\n\n12\n00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:38.791\n&gt;&gt; You got the flashlight\nof truth with you.\n\n13\n00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.871\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do.\n\n14\n00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:41.172\nAnd how are you today, Zach?\n\n15\n00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:42.600\n&gt;&gt; I'm great and I'm excited.\n\n16\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.421\nAnd I know that in the previous\nepisode we created what?\n\n17\n00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.709\nWe created the fighter, right?\n\n18\n00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:47.465\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n19\n00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.192\n&gt;&gt; So now it's time to create\nthe attacker, so let's do that.\n\n20\n00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:52.851\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\nwe do need to create the attacker.\n\n21\n00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.490\nBecause well, without an attacker,\n\n22\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.782\nthe fighter doesn't really have\nany impetus on being there.\n\n23\n00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:03.463\nIf you don't have someone to fight,\nthere's no point in fighting, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.624\n&gt;&gt; You have no give and take.\n\n25\n00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:07.306\nSo what do we need to do to\ncreate the attacker, Justin?\n\n26\n00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:12.100\n&gt;&gt; So in order to create the attacker, we\nneed to create the essential data, right?\n\n27\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.632\nThe data [INAUDIBLE], it's gonna be held\nin memory that represents an attacker.\n\n28\n00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.013\nNow I know some of you are like,\nwell, in our plannings episode,\n\n29\n00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:22.028\na couple episodes back, you actually\nsaid there's gonna be a bunch of them.\n\n30\n00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.487\nAll right, I did, full disclosure.\n\n31\n00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:28.585\nI always, when I'm thinking\nabout a bunch of something,\n\n32\n00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.699\nI wanna make sure that one works-\n&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense.\n\n33\n00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:35.421\n&gt;&gt; Before I actually try to do a bunch of\nthem, because if I have a bunch of them,\n\n34\n00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:39.221\nand there's something wrong with each\nof them, then it's harder to debug.\n\n35\n00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:43.469\nBut if I can get one of them working\nas I kind of expect it to, okay,\n\n36\n00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.071\nnow just making a bunch of them\nincludes building an array.\n\n37\n00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.137\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise it looks like\na bunch of angry amoebas.\n\n38\n00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:50.333\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [SOUND].\n\n39\n00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.400\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.723\n&gt;&gt; That's not what we want.\n\n41\n00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:56.927\nWe don't want a lot of jittering,\nand we want ease of debugging.\n\n42\n00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:01.360\nBut we also wanna keep moving toward our\ngoal, right, in small, incremental steps.\n\n43\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.480\nAnd well, I think there's no\nbetter than now to go ahead and\n\n44\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.690\nstart building that attacker.\n\n45\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.890\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n46\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.350\nJust a quick review of where we left off.\n\n47\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.229\nWe didn't even really have animation, so\nto speak, other than on keydown, right?\n\n48\n00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.372\nSo when I hit that left and\nright arrow key, my fighter moves, and\n\n49\n00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.410\nthen we clear the screen and re-render.\n\n50\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230\nAgain, that was great for testing.\n\n51\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.810\nIt's not necessarily something\nthat we probably wanna keep\n\n52\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.600\nin order to get this to work out,\nbut that's all right.\n\n53\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.080\nSo we have our fighter, and\nour fighter can be placed.\n\n54\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.511\nAnd right now, I'm not worried so\nmuch about the placement in the game,\n\n55\n00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.885\nbecause we'll just get\nsomething on the screen.\n\n56\n00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:41.762\nWe'll get it to work, and then we'll\nworry about placement as we get closer.\n\n57\n00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.347\nBecause there is some math that we'll\nprobably have to do in order to get\n\n58\n00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:45.890\nthe placement to work.\n\n59\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.010\nAll right, so let's see here.\n\n60\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.110\nIf we look at the attacker,\nwhat do we need?\n\n61\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.171\nIf we come over here and we plan a little\nbit, and let me zoom in just a touch,\n\n62\n00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:56.894\nthere we go.\n\n63\n00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:58.636\nSo that's what we have.\n\n64\n00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:03.007\nI'm thinking an attacker could\njust more or less be a square,\n\n65\n00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:06.706\nmaybe a rectangular object\nthat is placed here, and\n\n66\n00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:11.102\ncan move under this back and\nforth nature, and hits the edge.\n\n67\n00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:13.000\nAll right, so we need the ability to move.\n\n68\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.200\nWe need the ability to render.\n\n69\n00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.336\nBut we also need in order to render and\nmove, we need position,\n\n70\n00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:21.140\nright, an x and y position.\n\n71\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.399\nWe also need a width and a height, right?\n\n72\n00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.475\nLet's keep that consistent, cuz I think\nthat'll be easier to reason about.\n\n73\n00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:30.492\nAnd then we need the ability\nto actual render using those.\n\n74\n00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:33.094\nSo let's build our attacker class.\n\n75\n00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:36.796\nNow again, just to reiterate,\nclass is supported in newer browsers.\n\n76\n00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:39.690\nThis is a new addition to JavaScript.\n\n77\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.070\nThis is just a wrapper\naround prototype functions.\n\n78\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.460\nIf you have no idea what I'm talking\nabout, definitely check out our library.\n\n79\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.570\nAnd including that, the previous episode\nwhere I talk a little bit about that.\n\n80\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.939\nBut if you wanna know about the prototype,\nchain, and constructor functions, well,\n\n81\n00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.436\nI have several videos in the library\ntalking exclusively about that.\n\n82\n00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.155\n&gt;&gt; And well worth watching, absolutely.\n\n83\n00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:03.926\n&gt;&gt; This is just a wrapper around that\nthat provides a class based construct.\n\n84\n00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:07.044\nSo we'll go with that,\nand if I do see fit,\n\n85\n00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:12.344\nmaybe I'll show you the two versions\nat a later time, once we're done.\n\n86\n00:04:12.344 --> 00:04:14.503\nSo let's create an Attacker object here.\n\n87\n00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:19.110\nAnd actually, this is the class that\nrepresents the Attacker object.\n\n88\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.750\nNow in these classes, for\n\n89\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350\nthe most part we're always\ngonna wanna have a constructor.\n\n90\n00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.833\nBecause how do we make an Attacker?\n\n91\n00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:27.515\nWhen we call the new keyword,\nhow is that going to work?\n\n92\n00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:33.710\nWell, I need an x and a y, and I think\nthat's all we're gonna need for now.\n\n93\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.980\nWe may tweak that, and I'm going\nto say this.x = x, and this.y = y.\n\n94\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.511\nAnd this.height =, let's go with 30,\n\n95\n00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.804\nand this.width = 30.\n\n96\n00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:53.680\nOkay, so there's our width and our height.\n\n97\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.370\nAnd let's just make sure that\nwe can create an attacker,\n\n98\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.710\nthat we don't have any syntax errors here.\n\n99\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.934\nSo I'm gonna come down here and\nright after the fighter,\n\n100\n00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:05.642\nI'm going to say const\nattacker = new Attacker.\n\n101\n00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:12.915\nAnd let's place this right\nin the middle of the screen,\n\n102\n00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:19.434\nso screen.width / 2 and screen.height / 2.\n\n103\n00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:25.350\nNow do keep in mind, I usually use\nthe word canvas and CTX for the context.\n\n104\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.900\nI'll change those up a little\nbit just to reinforce it.\n\n105\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.813\nThere's nothing special\nabout those variable names.\n\n106\n00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:34.977\nAnd more aptly what we're seeing is kind\nof like an old arcade screen, right,\n\n107\n00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:40.000\nthe screen that you're looking at\nwhile you're controlling your player.\n\n108\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.240\nSo we'll go with that.\n\n109\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.671\nSo if we come over here and we render.\n\n110\n00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.450\nAnd we should have access because I have\nall of this in global namespace right now.\n\n111\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.655\nThere's our attacker.\n\n112\n00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:56.060\nWe have an attacker with a height,\nand a width, and a position.\n\n113\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.539\nOkay, that's what we want.\n\n114\n00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.635\nAll right,\nnow we need to get it on the screen.\n\n115\n00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:06.317\nHow do we render the attacker?\n\n116\n00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:08.546\nWell, we should have a render method.\n\n117\n00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:13.403\nNow again, just to reiterate, we've\nseen people call this draw or show or,\n\n118\n00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:16.858\nI like to call it render,\nbecause it makes sense to me.\n\n119\n00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:17.718\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n120\n00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:19.262\n&gt;&gt; And we've gotta keep it consistent,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:20.529\nIt is rendering to the screen.\n\n122\n00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.781\nNow that might be because\nof my technical background.\n\n123\n00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:26.437\nYou could call it draw or whatever you\nwanted to, you could call it chiseling.\n\n124\n00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:27.482\n&gt;&gt; You can call it flubber.\n\n125\n00:06:27.482 --> 00:06:29.467\n&gt;&gt; You could call it flubber, I mean,\n\n126\n00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:34.112\nthat would be a horrible method name that\nwas not really semantically meaningful.\n\n127\n00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:36.457\nMight not be understood\nin the command line.\n\n128\n00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:40.521\nRight, I come back and\nlook at Zach's code three days later.\n\n129\n00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:43.459\nI'm like, Zach,\nI'm not sure what any of this does.\n\n130\n00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:48.060\nSo that's okay, right,\nthat's part of the learning process.\n\n131\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.710\nI tend to be very straightforward.\n\n132\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.410\nSo let's come in and render, and\nthat's gonna take a context.\n\n133\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.120\nAnd let's just keep this consistent,\nso I will say context.\n\n134\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.716\nAnd then, as always,\n\n135\n00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:05.264\nit's not necessarily always the case\nthat I need to do ctx.restore and save.\n\n136\n00:07:05.264 --> 00:07:10.429\nBut it kind of safeguards me against\naccidentally changing colors or\n\n137\n00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:13.286\npatterns, or maybe even font sizes.\n\n138\n00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:16.781\nWell, we want to keep this consistent.\n\n139\n00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:18.615\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n140\n00:07:18.615 --> 00:07:23.431\nI'm going to fillRect with this.x, this.y,\n\n141\n00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:28.482\nthis.width, apparently,\nI can't type today,\n\n142\n00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:31.897\nand this.height, just like so.\n\n143\n00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:36.794\nOkay, we will not actually see anything\nuntil I render the attacker to\n\n144\n00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:38.210\nthe screen render.\n\n145\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.063\nSo attacker.render.\n\n146\n00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.895\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:50.578\nSo refresh, uh-oh, CTX is, and\nI did the same thing again.\n\n148\n00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:54.191\nIt's amazing what muscle memory will do.\n\n149\n00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.800\nYou're always used to typing CTX, and\n\n150\n00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.334\nsome of you are probably screaming at the\nscreen going, that's not right, Justin.\n\n151\n00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:04.077\nBut let's use the full context,\nand boom, there's our attacker.\n\n152\n00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:05.888\nIt is on the screen.\n\n153\n00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:08.969\nThere is one thing we\nnoticed about the fighter\n\n154\n00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:14.270\nthat I noticed about the attacker\nby default they're kinda all black.\n\n155\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:20.500\nSo we should probably go ahead and\nchange colors, add a color field.\n\n156\n00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.401\nSo, let's say this.color and I want that\nto maybe we have have different types of\n\n157\n00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:29.166\nattackers, so I wanna make this\nsomething that we can put in but\n\n158\n00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:32.560\nalso have a default backup\nvery similar to the fighter.\n\n159\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.890\nSo I'm gonna say default argument\ncolor = I think let's go with yellow.\n\n160\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.520\nYes something crazy, yellow.\n\n161\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Easier to track.\n\n162\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n163\n00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:49.520\nthen context.fillStyle =\nthis.color; there we go.\n\n164\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.500\nAnd boom, there's our yellow attacker.\n\n165\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.040\nSo we can actually see those, Zack,\nthere you have it, I've made an attacker,\n\n166\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.080\nit's on the screen.\n\n167\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.540\nBut it does look like you have a question.\n\n168\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.860\n&gt;&gt; Well I do.\nIt seems like the fighter and\n\n169\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.750\nthe attacker are using similar code.\n\n170\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.600\nIs it possible we could use that?\n\n171\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're on to something.\n\n172\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.970\nZack's been with me for a while now and is\nstarting to pick up on these small things.\n\n173\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.500\nIf we look through the fighter and\nthe attacker code,\n\n174\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.630\nour constructor, and our constructor,\nthey are almost identical.\n\n175\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.740\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; Other than the width and\n\n176\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.365\nthe height, right?\n\n177\n00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The width and the height are a little\n\n178\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.970\nbit different cuz I want relative\nproportions to be different.\n\n179\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.620\nBut they're almost the same.\n\n180\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.170\nLikewise, the render function\nis exactly the same.\n\n181\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.690\nSo your kinda first-gut reaction,\nyou're like, well, that,\n\n182\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.450\nwe could probably pull that up into\na superclass, maybe call it entity, right?\n\n183\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Or Flubber.\n\n184\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Or Flubber, don't call it Flubber.\n\n185\n00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Don't, no, no.\n\n186\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.385\n&gt;&gt; No, don't call it Flubber.\n\n187\n00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe call it entity of something\n\n188\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.940\nthat's gonna be rendered onto the game\nboard and constructed and rendered.\n\n189\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.890\nAnd then attacker and fighter could\nextends that or inherit from that.\n\n190\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.025\nRight, we could use what's known\nas a class base inheritance.\n\n191\n00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.850\n&gt;&gt; I caution against that at this point.\n\n193\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.770\nMainly because we don't have a full\nimplementation for either one, and\n\n194\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.740\nwe may find that we have\nto make additional changes.\n\n195\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.653\nSo this kind of premature abstraction\ncan sometimes lead you down to\n\n196\n00:10:16.653 --> 00:10:18.040\nthis road really.\n\n197\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.143\nWell now, if you're a whole lot better\nplanner or if you've been doing this for\n\n198\n00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:24.103\nawhile that might not be the case, but\n\n199\n00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:26.690\nI would forewarn you,\nlet those things fall out.\n\n200\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.440\nNow, when we're done with the game, if\nwe find out that those are still exactly\n\n201\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.920\nthe same,\nwe will probably do just exactly that.\n\n202\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.100\nWe'll pull that, rearrange and\n\n203\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.970\ndo it super class probably called\nentity or something of that nature.\n\n204\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.430\nAnd then extend attacker and fighter and\nthen only implement the methods for\n\n205\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.260\nthe respective classes that are needed.\n\n206\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.520\nBut, for now, we'll just leave it be,\nbut, good eye, Zack.\n\n207\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.230\nI do have another question for\nyou, though.\n\n208\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.550\nIf you were to play this game,\nright, I can move.\n\n209\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:01.980\nIf you were to play this game,\nwhat would you say?\n\n210\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.650\nWould this sit okay with you, or\nwould this be a playable game or what?\n\n211\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.880\n&gt;&gt; It's as if the attacker\nis not moving really.\n\n212\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.520\nIt isn't moving.\n\n213\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.590\nSo is that something\nthat we can get moving?\n\n214\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.190\nHow do we make it mobile?\n\n215\n00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.480\n&gt;&gt; We need to make it mobile.\n\n216\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.920\nAnd also to some extent it went invisible.\n\n217\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.790\n&gt;&gt; It did, right there.\n\n218\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, so.\n\n219\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.050\n&gt;&gt; It's hiding from me.\n\n220\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.890\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't like me.\n\n221\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Why did it get invisible?\n\n222\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.270\nWell that's because I clear the rect\nevery time I hit the key down, and\n\n223\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.650\nevery time I clear the rect and\n\n224\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.470\nhit the key down it removes\neverything that is not re-rendered.\n\n225\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.190\nThat's why I aforementioned\nearlier on the episode,\n\n226\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.410\nthis might not be the best place\nto put this kind of render right?\n\n227\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.650\nSo, We're gonna fix that.\n\n228\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.750\nBut the attacker should move.\n\n229\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.990\nBut which one do we do first?\n\n230\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.290\nDo we fix the render, or\ndo we fix the movement, or?\n\n231\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.850\nWell, it's kinda whichever\none you choose to do.\n\n232\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.020\nLet's do this.\n\n233\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.084\nLet's create a function, called render.\n\n234\n00:12:09.166 --> 00:12:10.470\nJust like so.\n\n235\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.085\nLet's call a function called update.\n\n236\n00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:22.015\nLike so, and let's create a main function\nthat is actually going to be kind\n\n237\n00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:25.457\nof our main game loop,\nwhat's going on in the game.\n\n238\n00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:31.101\nFor render, what I'm thinking is instead\nof having like fighter.render and,\n\n239\n00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.560\nlet's just make sure this works.\n\n240\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.710\nLet's pull this out and put it inside\nof render and keep this consistent and\n\n241\n00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:44.040\nsay render but now we need to render\nthe attacker as well, just like so.\n\n242\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.120\nAnd then we can remove this and\ncall render here.\n\n243\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.440\nNow this is just kind of a transitional\nperiod though, these small steps.\n\n244\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.120\nSo we make sure we don't break\nanything and render here.\n\n245\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.675\nAll right, so now we've kind of\nalleviated the fact that the attacker\n\n246\n00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:04.510\ndoesn't disappear, right,\nbut it's still not moving.\n\n247\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:12.200\nOkay, so I don't think that rendering\nthere would be the best thing.\n\n248\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.980\nI think really all we should\ndo is move the fighter and\n\n249\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.080\nthen let the rendering\noccur somewhere else, okay.\n\n250\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.480\nLet the rendering be handled by like our\nanimation gain loop or animation and\n\n251\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.760\nthis main could more aptly\nbe called animate, right?\n\n252\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.130\nBut I like to think of it\nas the main game loop.\n\n253\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.310\nNow the main game loop,\nwhat is it going to do?\n\n254\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.790\nIt's going to update, and\nthen it's going to render.\n\n255\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:50.532\nAnd likewise it's going to make sure,\nThat we get ready for\n\n256\n00:13:50.532 --> 00:13:54.879\nthe next paint, right, the next time\nwe're ready to update and render, right,\n\n257\n00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:56.653\nupdate render, update render.\n\n258\n00:13:56.653 --> 00:14:00.847\nNow I've pulled these out into functions\njust because the main gang loop a lot of\n\n259\n00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:02.047\ntimes is very simple.\n\n260\n00:14:02.047 --> 00:14:05.596\nAnd we don't have to have a lot of logic\nwith the fighter because that's handled by\n\n261\n00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:07.210\nan event listener.\n\n262\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.060\nThat will mutate the fighter and\nthen, that's fine.\n\n263\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:18.850\nLet's go see if we say main just like so,\nand then boom, everything stills\n\n264\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:23.630\nworks exactly the same except now we're\ngetting main call of a bunch of times.\n\n265\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.610\nHopefully up to about\n60 frames per second.\n\n266\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.071\nNow these are fairly simplistic games so\n\n267\n00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:33.283\nyou don' have to worry about crazy physics\nor things like that, for the most part.\n\n268\n00:14:33.283 --> 00:14:35.480\n&gt;&gt; Justin did our attacker change shape?\n\n269\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.569\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it did,\n\n270\n00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:39.524\nI think it might be just some\nzoomed stuff there that so.\n\n271\n00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:40.783\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n272\n00:14:40.783 --> 00:14:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, we'll make sure.\n\n273\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.452\nWe'll make sure, later.\n\n274\n00:14:43.452 --> 00:14:48.120\nAll right, so now that we kind\nof have that squared away,\n\n275\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.300\nthis update function, all right?\n\n276\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.180\nNotice that render is\ndefined above attacker.\n\n277\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.050\nActually, let's move these so\nthey're in a more logical order.\n\n278\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.520\nLet's put them right here.\n\n279\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.199\nActually we should\nprobably put them up here,\n\n280\n00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.747\nbecause these are going to be constructed.\n\n281\n00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:09.156\nAnd then we're going to register event\nlisteners and then we're going to create\n\n282\n00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:13.030\na render and an update and a main, and\ncall main and that kicks off the process.\n\n283\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.776\nWhat about update?\n\n284\n00:15:13.776 --> 00:15:20.960\nWell I think update is going to be\nbest for things that are automated.\n\n285\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.210\nAnd the movement of an attacker\nis automated by nature.\n\n286\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:32.872\nIt's not looking for me to hit buttons,\nwhat it should do is [SOUND].\n\n287\n00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:33.576\nJust like that.\n\n288\n00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:34.824\n&gt;&gt; And it will make doot-doot-doot noise.\n\n289\n00:15:34.824 --> 00:15:35.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, that would be cool.\n\n290\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.369\nMaybe we'll add that ain a later episode,\nbut for now let's get it moving.\n\n291\n00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:40.927\n&gt;&gt; Sound card.\n\n292\n00:15:40.927 --> 00:15:46.340\n&gt;&gt; So in order to move in an automated\nfashion, what do we need?\n\n293\n00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.224\nWell, if it's going to move right and\nleft and right, and left, and\n\n294\n00:15:51.224 --> 00:15:52.835\nis moving up and down.\n\n295\n00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:56.502\nAnd actually it's moving down, let's just\nworry about the right and left first.\n\n296\n00:15:56.502 --> 00:16:02.090\nOkay, so right and left,\n\n297\n00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.430\nlet's say that we have.\n\n298\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.072\nLet's call this attacker.update.\n\n299\n00:16:11.072 --> 00:16:15.230\nSo the update function actually\nruns update on automated things.\n\n300\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So what does update do?\n\n301\n00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:23.170\nWell, let's see here.\n\n302\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.390\nUpdate on the attacker.\n\n303\n00:16:26.434 --> 00:16:31.318\nShould just move it by some amount,\nbut in order to move it we need,\n\n304\n00:16:31.318 --> 00:16:35.930\nhow much is it going to move by\nper frame kind of tick, right?\n\n305\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.253\nPer frame.\n\n306\n00:16:37.253 --> 00:16:42.260\nI'm gonna call this dx and let's just\nstart at one to make sure that it works.\n\n307\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:48.240\nAnd to some extent, this is the velocity\nof the attacker, so modifying it should,\n\n308\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.030\nin theory, change that.\n\n309\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:56.054\nAnd all I'm gonna say is\nthis.x += this.dx, okay.\n\n310\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.493\nSo this .dx is one, and\nwe're calling update, and\n\n311\n00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:02.335\nwe're zooming out on the window.\n\n312\n00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:06.139\nAnd then, we're calling update\na bunch of times inside of main,\n\n313\n00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:08.180\nwhich is just attacker.update.\n\n314\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.230\nLet's see if that, and hey.\n\n315\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n316\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.580\n&gt;&gt; We got our attacker moving,\nand it's moving.\n\n317\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.000\nIt's out of.\n\n318\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Onto infinity.\n\n319\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Whoops.\n&gt;&gt; And beyond.\n\n320\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Whoopsie daisy.\n\n321\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.700\nSo there's a couple of\nways we could do this.\n\n322\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.760\nI think the first way,\nbefore we worry about it,\n\n323\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.000\nis just getting it working,\nis to put that inside of the update.\n\n324\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.540\nBecause the update,\n\n325\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.880\nit really should update only if\nthere's not a condition met.\n\n326\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.580\nNamely as long as it doesn't hit\nthe edge of the screen, right?\n\n327\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.065\nSo If attacker.hitsEdge, and\n\n328\n00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:51.378\nI'm gonna pass in the screen that hits\n\n329\n00:17:51.378 --> 00:17:56.370\nthe edge of the screen then do what.\n\n330\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.660\nOtherwise, here we go.\n\n331\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.550\nI think this is a little\nbit of logic here.\n\n332\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.725\nIf it hits the edge of the screen,\ndo this, which is currently nothing,\n\n333\n00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:08.787\notherwise update, right?\n\n334\n00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:13.697\nOr move, maybe this update\nshould probably be more aptly\n\n335\n00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:17.082\nnamed moved to keep some consistency.\n\n336\n00:18:17.082 --> 00:18:19.310\nI think I'm going to go with that.\n\n337\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:26.290\nLet's say move, and\nthat way it makes a little more sense.\n\n338\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:26.800\nWhat is update?\n\n339\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.120\nIt could be updating a lot of things.\n\n340\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.100\nBut now we know that it's moving.\n\n341\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.890\nAnd we're gonna assume that\nmoving is left and right.\n\n342\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.380\nOkay, so now the attacker hits the edge.\n\n343\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.780\nWhat do we want it to do?\n\n344\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.473\nWell, I'm thinking we wanted\nto kinda drop down, right?\n\n345\n00:18:45.473 --> 00:18:52.390\nSo attacker.dropDown.\n\n346\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:58.144\nThis method doesn't exist, if we get back\nand we try this, all kinds of errors.\n\n347\n00:18:58.144 --> 00:19:00.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, hit edge.\n\n348\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.395\nLet's actually say hits edge.\n\n349\n00:19:02.395 --> 00:19:05.530\nHits edge and drop down both\ndon't exist on the attacker.\n\n350\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:14.700\nAnd if I go and add those, hitsEdge and\nwe'll say, of some boundary.\n\n351\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.515\nWe know that's the screen.\n\n352\n00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:17.868\nWe're gonna say, of boundary.\n\n353\n00:19:17.868 --> 00:19:21.940\nOr drop down, okay.\n\n354\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.780\nNow if we come back and we refresh,\nall those errors go away, we're all good.\n\n355\n00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.290\nIt's not doing anything, but\nwe've added the methods.\n\n356\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.265\nAll right, so\nwe have some readable methods here.\n\n357\n00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:35.580\nWhat does hitsEdge mean?\n\n358\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:41.680\nI'm going to assume the boundary\nobject has a width and a height, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.900\nWe're only gonna use the width coz we're\ntalking about the left/right edge.\n\n360\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:56.056\nSo let's return this.x + this.width.\n\n361\n00:19:56.056 --> 00:20:00.810\nSo, I'm over if this other\nedge comes over here and hits.\n\n362\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.020\nWell, it's actually reverse for you.\n\n363\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.010\nSo, Let's assume this is the side and\n\n364\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.564\nthen it touches in order to drop down and\nstart moving the other way.\n\n365\n00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:12.593\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n366\n00:20:12.593 --> 00:20:16.148\nSo, we want it to stay within that.\n\n367\n00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:24.816\nSo we've got to test whether the x\n+ this.width &gt;= boundary.width.\n\n368\n00:20:24.816 --> 00:20:26.890\nNow why am I doing the width?\n\n369\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.650\nBecause it starts as zero, the width\nis going to be the last position that's\n\n370\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.220\navailable in the extra reaction, right?\n\n371\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.461\nSo it just so\nhappens that those values are the same.\n\n372\n00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:41.771\nOr this.x &lt;= the left-hand position,\n\n373\n00:20:41.771 --> 00:20:46.440\non the left hand of\nthe screen right over here,\n\n374\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.190\nwhich is zero if it's in the x\ndirection it it's zero then boom.\n\n375\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.700\nAlright, so if it hits the edge,\nhow do we drop down?\n\n376\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.310\nWell, I'm thinking that\nthis.y is += this.height.\n\n377\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.130\nAnd let's just go down\nhalf a height of the inch.\n\n378\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.278\nSo it's gonna drop down\nhalf of its height.\n\n379\n00:21:11.278 --> 00:21:16.852\nAnd this.dx =\n\n380\n00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:23.289\n-1 x this.dx.\n\n381\n00:21:23.289 --> 00:21:25.810\nAnd I think,\nI think they'll might get this.\n\n382\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.995\nSo it's gonna drop down, and\nit's gonna switch directions.\n\n383\n00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.180\nRight now switch directions in.\n\n384\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.375\nI could pull this out into another\nmethod and call it switch direction.\n\n385\n00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:34.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n386\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.340\nBut I'm gonna leave it here for now.\n\n387\n00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.610\nAnd let's see if it does in fact do this.\n\n388\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.910\nSo looking our fighter still works.\n\n389\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.226\nour fighter still work.\n\n390\n00:21:42.226 --> 00:21:46.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If all done, go boom.\n\n391\n00:21:46.158 --> 00:21:49.080\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna have a hard\ntime winning this game.\n\n392\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.434\nAs the fighters like, got to the edge,\nI'm going straight for the attack, right?\n\n393\n00:21:53.434 --> 00:21:55.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what happened?\n\n394\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.840\nWell, if we come back and we look,\na little bit of debugging here.\n\n395\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.955\nIf we hit the boundary and\nwe drop down and\n\n396\n00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:11.100\nthen we, we're always gonna\nhit the boundary, right?\n\n397\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.760\nIf we drop, I think it's\nprobably best if we go ahead and\n\n398\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.790\nmove one time as a temporary fix.\n\n399\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:22.210\nWe may find that when we continue to\nmake the game that changes a little bit.\n\n400\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.110\nSo now what should happen is,\n\n401\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:28.650\nit should drop down and then it should\nmove right in the opposite direction.\n\n402\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.267\nAnd by moving with inside of dropDown.\n\n403\n00:22:34.267 --> 00:22:36.897\nSo it drops down, and\nthen it moves one [SOUND],\n\n404\n00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:39.600\nit should get off the boundary's edge,\nokay?\n\n405\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.120\nNow, it is important that this.dx = -1,\nwe switch directions\n\n406\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.670\nbefore we move otherwise we're just\nkinda bouncing against the wall.\n\n407\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.030\nSo if we refresh, let's see if it works.\n\n408\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:57.040\nWe're coming, we're coming, and we're\ncoming and [LAUGH] there we go now we\n\n409\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.510\ngotta come over to the left and come over\nto the left wait for it, wait for it.\n\n410\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.530\nThis might be celebration and there we go.\n\n411\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.112\nNow, we kinda have the [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n412\n00:23:08.112 --> 00:23:10.565\n&gt;&gt; And we have that for\na single attacker and\n\n413\n00:23:10.565 --> 00:23:13.681\nthat would have been a lot\nharder to debug, right?\n\n414\n00:23:13.681 --> 00:23:15.810\nCuz what's going on?\n\n415\n00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.880\nBut now with one, I'm like, okay.\n\n416\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.580\nThe dynamicism of it\nactually is what I want.\n\n417\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.890\nI want it to behave just like this,\nit's all good.\n\n418\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.480\nAnd well, it looks like we got the\nbeginnings of the game, attacker is very\n\n419\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.530\nbasic, it's just rendered very basically,\nbut it does have the behavior that I want.\n\n420\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:41.740\nIt does have the position ability, and I'm\nstarting to see my vision come to life.\n\n421\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Well it looks like it took other\ncode beside the attacker code to get it\n\n422\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.970\nmoving though.\n\n423\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.300\nSo are we gonna keep that or\nis that just for testing?\n\n424\n00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.717\n&gt;&gt; So the other code that you\nare referring to is like the main method,\n\n425\n00:23:51.717 --> 00:23:54.860\nthe main function, the update, the render.\n\n426\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.300\nWe may keep parts of that.\n\n427\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.280\nSome of that may evolve.\n\n428\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:04.378\nEventually, I'll probably pull that out\nonto a more structured environment.\n\n429\n00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:08.010\nThe end of that is,\nparts of it, yes, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.590\nParts of it will probably\nchange as we discover\n\n431\n00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.430\nother kind of neurons behaviors, right?\n\n432\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.600\nSo we made a plan,\nwe're trying to work that plan.\n\n433\n00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.180\nBut plans don't always go according to,\nwell, the plan.\n\n434\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.620\nSo we're.\n&gt;&gt; Foreshadowing.\n\n435\n00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.050\n&gt;&gt; We may have to make some changes to\nthe additional code that we wrote but\n\n436\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.300\nit was necessary in order to test\nthis behavior, so no way around that.\n\n437\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.140\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, creating a basic attacker.\n\n438\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.790\nWonderful episode, as usual,\nJustin, great job.\n\n439\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.340\nAnd any last words before we move on?\n\n440\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.375\n&gt;&gt; So, I think my last word is,\nwe have our attacker.\n\n441\n00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n442\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.799\n&gt;&gt; We have our fighter.\n\n443\n00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:45.610\nBut right now we are defenseless, right?\n\n444\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.966\nOur attacker can move all the way down\nthere and get past us and all things go.\n\n445\n00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:51.730\nWe need some way to defend ourselves.\n\n446\n00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Laser beams.\n\n447\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.577\n&gt;&gt; Actually we're gonna call them pellets.\n\n448\n00:24:56.577 --> 00:24:57.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n449\n00:24:57.439 --> 00:25:01.722\nwe need to start creating pellets\nin pretty soon to be able to defend\n\n450\n00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:05.478\nourselves, so stay tuned for,\nwell being able to [SOUND].\n\n451\n00:25:05.478 --> 00:25:10.220\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] And I wanna see Justin\ncreate laser pellets, absolutely and so\n\n452\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.027\nwatch that next episode.\n\n453\n00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:16.257\nBy the way, catch every episode of HTML5\ncanvass projects because there is a lot of\n\n454\n00:25:16.257 --> 00:25:20.805\ngreat information, a lot of fun in there,\nand you'll appreciate it, you really will.\n\n455\n00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:22.391\nCheck out our course library,\n\n456\n00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:25.266\nhundreds of videos all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n457\n00:25:25.266 --> 00:25:28.070\nAnd thank you for watching DevpPro TV.\n\n458\n00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.400\nTell your friends about it, would you?\n\n459\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.330\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n460\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.010\nThanks for watching.\n\n461\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.850\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n462\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.630\n&gt;&gt;

I hope I'm just the man.\n\n9\n00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:32.776\nOtherwise, this is gonna\nbe a real short episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:33.948\nNo, I jest, I jest,\n\n11\n00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:37.750\nbut because, well, I have a pretty\ngood idea of where we're going.\n\n12\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.322\nBut you never know.\n\n13\n00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.711\nSome things throw a kind\nof kink in things.\n\n14\n00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.991\nBut before we move on,\nZach, how are you today?\n\n15\n00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:45.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.263\nAnd in previous episodes we made\nthe fighter, we made the attacker but\n\n17\n00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:53.874\nnow we need a way to defend ourselves and\nthat's what the pellets are all about.\n\n18\n00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:56.041\nAre we gonna do 1 pellet, 25,000 pellets?\n\n19\n00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.690\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n20\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.683\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I think we're gonna start with one.\n\n21\n00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:00.208\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n22\n00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:06.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to continue using this\nparadigm of we have a collection.\n\n23\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.777\nLet's stick with one, make sure one works\nbefore we worry about a bunch of them.\n\n24\n00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:13.284\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n25\n00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:17.779\ngood, now what that means is we're\ngonna probably have to mark in some\n\n26\n00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.390\ninteractions and such.\n\n27\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.500\nMainly just because the one pellet is,\nis kinda weird right?\n\n28\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.353\nRight, that would be an interesting\ninteraction in a game [SOUND], I'm out.\n\n29\n00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:31.840\n&gt;&gt; One bullet in the gun that's all.\n\n30\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.790\n&gt;&gt; That's all we got.\n\n31\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.004\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; The metaphorical gun.\n\n32\n00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.943\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, metaphorically speaking but\nour pellets,\n\n33\n00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:40.098\nwhen I think of pellets\nthey're kinda round objects.\n\n34\n00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:43.451\nBut were were going to need to create\nthose, need to create the data object.\n\n35\n00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:47.887\nWe need to create their ability to move\nand render and, well, let's go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:51.428\nget that one pellet on the screen and\nsee how this work out for us.\n\n37\n00:01:51.428 --> 00:01:55.367\nSo if we come back to my screen here and\nwe have our attacker and\n\n38\n00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:00.290\nthis is kinda getting crowded but\nwe'll deal with that later.\n\n39\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.380\nSo we have our fighter,\nwe have our attacker And\n\n40\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.670\nhere's our attacker and our fighter.\n\n41\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.620\nLet's go ahead and create a pellet object.\n\n42\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.760\nNow let's think about what a pellet is,\nright.\n\n43\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.488\nSo I'm thinking it's kind of\nshot from the fighter, right.\n\n44\n00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:15.898\nIt originates from there.\n\n45\n00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:17.538\nAnd then it'll move up the screen,\n\n46\n00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.695\nwhich is actually in\nthe negative y direction right.\n\n47\n00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.710\nIt'll move up the screen, And\n\n48\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.030\nthen it'll have the ability to determine\non whether it hit something, right?\n\n49\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.810\nAnd we're not too worried about\nthat at current time, but\n\n50\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.670\nwe wanna get on screen rendered and\nmove it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.385\nOkay, so in order to do that,\nwe need a constructor function.\n\n52\n00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.830\nAnd what does it need?\n\n53\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.268\nIt needs an x and a y, and\nokay I think all pellets should probably\n\n54\n00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:53.330\nmove at the same speed so\nwe're going to keep that the same.\n\n55\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.705\nAnd I think they should all be\nroughly the same shape, right?\n\n56\n00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It is very unlikely that you have\n\n57\n00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:02.385\ndifferent sized pellets,\ndepending on when you fire.\n\n58\n00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:05.414\nThat would make the game\ndynamic maybe interesting, but\n\n59\n00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:08.579\na little harder to reason about it,\nat least this early on.\n\n60\n00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.695\nSo let's just say this.y equals y.\n\n61\n00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:18.200\nAnd then this.width = 3;\nlet's keep it pretty small.\n\n62\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.150\nAnd this.height = maybe 10; that still\nmay be kinda big but we'll get that.\n\n63\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.620\nAnd then we do know that the pellet,\nI'm thinking it'll go straight up.\n\n64\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.250\nIt won't move left or right, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.700\nSo we need a dy, and that needs to be,\n\n66\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.660\nlet's just keep it a -5 for now.\n\n67\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.780\nSo it's gonna move in the y direction,\nthe up y direction.\n\n68\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.810\nOkay, so there's your constructor.\n\n69\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.360\nAnd, well, we've already talked about,\nthe pellet should be able to move.\n\n70\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.080\nAnd the pellet should also,\nit should render.\n\n71\n00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.680\nAnd it takes a context.\n\n72\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.830\nAnd now we can say context.say,\nand then context.restore.\n\n73\n00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:10.802\nAnd before we actually, well,\n\n74\n00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:16.419\nwe've done this a couple of times for\nthe render so\n\n75\n00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.580\nI feel pretty confident about this.\n\n76\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.406\nWe probably need to go ahead and\nset a color, all right.\n\n77\n00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:28.278\nOur entity should be of different color so\nwe can identify what they are.\n\n78\n00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:28.959\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n79\n00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:33.835\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the pellet,\nthis.color = color, and\n\n80\n00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:42.060\nwe set a default color in the constructor\nto blue may be we'll go with blue.\n\n81\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.635\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:47.973\n&gt;&gt; So there's our fillStyle and\nthis is this.color and\n\n83\n00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:52.013\nthen context.fillRect(this.x).\n\n84\n00:04:54.426 --> 00:05:00.248\nThis.y, this.width,\nthis.height, just like so.\n\n85\n00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:04.990\nAll right, so\nthese brackets should not be there.\n\n86\n00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:09.485\nAnd I think we should now be\nable to construct a pellet.\n\n87\n00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:12.120\nSo let's create our pellet here.\n\n88\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.117\nAnd make sure that our construction\nactually works like we anticipate it to.\n\n89\n00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.945\nSo here's our pellet and\nwhere am I gonna put this?\n\n90\n00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:27.765\nLet's put this just that 100 100 and\nthat's all I really care about.\n\n91\n00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n92\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.030\n&gt;&gt; So 100, 100, okay,\nlet's go check out this pellet.\n\n93\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.520\nSo if I refresh, here's our pellet and\nit does construct.\n\n94\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.200\nNow, the reason I do this is because\nsometimes you'll have a typo or\n\n95\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.400\nsomething like that and\none of this fields will be undefined.\n\n96\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.130\nAnd then, undefine plus a number is\nnot a number, which then is nan and\n\n97\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.630\nkind of propagates, and\nthings get messed up.\n\n98\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.110\nAnd it doesn't really error out.\n\n99\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.180\nIt just doesn't render\ncorrectly a lot of times.\n\n100\n00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.840\nSo I like to check these to make sure\nconstruction works as it may be.\n\n101\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.890\nSo here's our pellet, and now let's\ngo ahead and get it on the screen.\n\n102\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.305\nSo if we have our pellets that's,\nthat's probably gonna be in the render.\n\n103\n00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.638\nSo pellet.render,\n\n104\n00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:20.566\nyou wanna pass in the global context.\n\n105\n00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:26.572\nAnd then for update,\nwe should probably say pellet.move,\n\n106\n00:06:26.572 --> 00:06:32.827\njust like that, but\npellet.moves not going to do many thing.\n\n107\n00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:37.903\nIt's good, fill that in\n\n108\n00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:44.480\nthis.y = or += this.dy.\n\n109\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.961\nJust like that, okay,\nI think we've got this.\n\n110\n00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.750\n&gt;&gt; Crossing the fingers,\nJustin, crossing fingers.\n\n111\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.027\n&gt;&gt; So if we refresh, and\nyou just saw it, just for a second.\n\n112\n00:06:56.027 --> 00:06:58.977\n[SOUND] So there's our pellet.\n\n113\n00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:03.164\nLet's move that down just a little bit so\nwe can see it.\n\n114\n00:07:03.164 --> 00:07:06.258\nNope, not that way.\n\n115\n00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:10.957\n100 and then 500.\n\n116\n00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:13.840\n[SOUND] And well, there you go Zach.\n\n117\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.412\nI said we were gonna create the pellet and\nwe have.\n\n118\n00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:19.979\n&gt;&gt; Who needs real sound\neffects when we have Justin?\n\n119\n00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.337\nThis is a question for you though.\n\n120\n00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:23.522\nAnd I hate to keep bringing\nup the same issue here.\n\n121\n00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:26.686\nBut it looks like we're using the same\ncode for the pellet that we use for\n\n122\n00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:29.025\nthe fighter, that we use for the attacker.\n\n123\n00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:29.930\nAm I right about that?\n\n124\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.770\nI mean,\nshould we be using something different?\n\n125\n00:07:34.295 --> 00:07:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Zach, you're learning my young padowan,\nI'm so proud of you.\n\n126\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.573\nBut you're absolutely correct.\n\n127\n00:07:40.573 --> 00:07:45.311\nActually if we look at the code,\nlet's see the similarities and\n\n128\n00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:50.240\nthen you'll probably have to worry\nabout my opinion, all right?\n\n129\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.827\nSo let's take a look at the screen here.\n\n130\n00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:55.538\nAnd here's the issue that\nZach's talking about.\n\n131\n00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:59.759\nIf we look at the classes for Fighter and\nAttacker We have this.x equals x,\n\n132\n00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:04.650\nthis.y equals y, this.height equals\nsomething, this.width equals something,\n\n133\n00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.407\nthis.color equals something, this.dx one.\n\n134\n00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:12.433\nWe do have a little bit of\nvariation because the fighter\n\n135\n00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:17.145\nis not moving with the dx,\ndy, okay that's fine.\n\n136\n00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:22.585\ndx, dy but it would, hey Ryan,\nI think there's probably an abstraction.\n\n137\n00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.908\n&gt;&gt; Some duplication, yes, no?\n\n138\n00:08:23.908 --> 00:08:27.673\n&gt;&gt; Ryan, there's some duplication, because\nthe constructor is always the same.\n\n139\n00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:32.187\nRight now the render is exactly the same,\nwe could almost copy and paste this.\n\n140\n00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:37.157\nThe move, the name's the same, but there's\na little bit of different implementation.\n\n141\n00:08:37.157 --> 00:08:38.981\nThere's some craziness there.\n\n142\n00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:44.283\nBut then the attacker has a hits edge and\ndrop down, so that's different.\n\n143\n00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:50.487\nAnd then the pellet has,\nit's moving in the y direction, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:52.738\nBut you're absolutely correct,\nthere's a lot of duplication there.\n\n145\n00:08:52.738 --> 00:08:55.447\nI do forewarn you,\ndon't get too hung up that.\n\n146\n00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:59.251\nIt's good that you recognize that,\nI say let's just let it mellow for\n\n147\n00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:01.943\na little while before we-\n&gt;&gt; Step by step.\n\n148\n00:09:01.943 --> 00:09:05.464\n&gt;&gt; Before we worry about going,\nI'm really gonna pull this into,\n\n149\n00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:08.013\ncuz we may find that we have\nto make changes based on\n\n150\n00:09:08.013 --> 00:09:10.763\nthe behaviors that we're hoping to create,\nright?\n\n151\n00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:14.703\nSo we're gonna leave that be for\nnow but you're absolutely correct,\n\n152\n00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:19.174\nthere's a lot duplication there, and\nthat should be a red flag to us And about,\n\n153\n00:09:19.174 --> 00:09:20.275\ndo you smell that?\n\n154\n00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:21.619\nSmells like duplication.\n\n155\n00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:22.313\n&gt;&gt; Smells like team spirit.\n\n156\n00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:27.358\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know how that\nsmells but [LAUGH] yeah, you're right,\n\n157\n00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:32.242\nwe should do something about that\nif it continues to be a problem.\n\n158\n00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:33.725\nRight now we're just gonna leave it be.\n\n159\n00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:34.813\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, good, good.\n\n160\n00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:35.525\nWell okay,\n\n161\n00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:40.658\nthe other thing I noticed too is it looks\nlike you're manually manipulating things.\n\n162\n00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:43.986\nShouldn't it be the user\nwho's gonna be in control?\n\n163\n00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:46.727\n&gt;&gt; You're right, I think this should\nprobably be a user control thing.\n\n164\n00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:50.073\nThis should be removing\nour little fighter, right?\n\n165\n00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:52.543\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And wherever the fighter is,\n\n166\n00:09:52.543 --> 00:09:57.629\nwhen we hit the space bar our pellet\nshould start there, I think, right?\n\n167\n00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:02.482\nOtherwise you're not,\nit's not gonna work out too well, right?\n\n168\n00:10:02.482 --> 00:10:06.242\nNow, this is gonna be one of those things,\nwe're gonna have to mock up some of these\n\n169\n00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:08.770\nactions just to get this\nworking because we're gonna,\n\n170\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.482\nwe're gonna learn some things\nthrough this exploration.\n\n171\n00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:12.463\n&gt;&gt; We're always learning.\n\n172\n00:10:12.463 --> 00:10:13.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're always learning.\n\n173\n00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:18.351\nSo let's see if we can get it to where\nthe pellet fires from the fighter's\n\n174\n00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.987\nposition based on a Space bar hit, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n176\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.754\n&gt;&gt; Just for this single pellet.\n\n177\n00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:27.676\nAgain, not a great defense.\n\n178\n00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:29.767\nIf you get one, and\nyou'll be like, I got one.\n\n179\n00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:30.791\n&gt;&gt; You made it count, right?\n\n180\n00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now maybe if the pellet goes up and\n\n181\n00:10:33.318 --> 00:10:37.223\nit explodes or something, but\nright now, just [SOUND], that's it.\n\n182\n00:10:37.223 --> 00:10:42.178\nSo let's get that working, and\nthen once we get that working,\n\n183\n00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:46.770\nwe can probably try to test\nmaybe it hitting the attacker?\n\n184\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.114\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; And figuring that out.\n\n185\n00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.482\nBut let's see if we can get that.\n\n186\n00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:51.696\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So this pellet,\n\n187\n00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:55.062\nwe can't use constant anymore because\nthis is gonna be one of those\n\n188\n00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:58.625\ndynamically created and\nassigned variable links, at least for now.\n\n189\n00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:04.655\nSo we're gonna say let pellet and then\nI'm gonna remove this just like so, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:05.950\nSo we have some pellet.\n\n191\n00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.938\nIf I got back and I refresh now,\nit is all kinds of broke because pellet\n\n192\n00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:14.820\nis undefined, so\nnow we gotta come in and put guards.\n\n193\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.143\nWhat do I mean?\n\n194\n00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:22.587\nWe have to say if there is a pellet,\nthen do this, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:22.587 --> 00:11:27.483\nNow I've left off the curly braces because\nthis is a single line and I can do that.\n\n196\n00:11:27.483 --> 00:11:30.651\nI don't like doing that and\nprobably wouldn't leave it that way.\n\n197\n00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:37.780\nLikewise, if(pellet) pellet.move, right?\n\n198\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.935\nNow, the original assigned value of\npellet when there's no assignment for\n\n199\n00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.037\nthat statement is undefined.\n\n200\n00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:49.573\nAnd undefined is false and so\nthat would not run based on those and\n\n201\n00:11:49.573 --> 00:11:53.827\nshouldn't run, and notice I don't\nhave many errors on here, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:59.427\nWhat, so it has sign an object to that,\nI should be able to go [SOUND].\n\n203\n00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.323\nJust like that noise.\n\n204\n00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:05.258\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So.\n\n205\n00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:07.743\nI just like making that noise,\nit's fun, it's fun.\n\n206\n00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:10.775\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But I wanna hit Space bar and\n\n207\n00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:12.820\nget that done, right?\n\n208\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.892\nSo where do our user\ninteractions come from?\n\n209\n00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:20.498\nWell, this key down on in this is handle\nuser interactions that I would probably\n\n210\n00:12:20.498 --> 00:12:21.955\npull us out eventually.\n\n211\n00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:26.348\nAnd we have the ability for\nthe left right arrow key and\n\n212\n00:12:26.348 --> 00:12:32.021\nto some extent the fighter is\ninitiating the shot of a pellet, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:38.815\nAnd one would that be or\nthere will be on the case of space.\n\n214\n00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:44.502\nLet's see, break, let's see if we can get\n\n215\n00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:50.355\na console.log here of firing away, right?\n\n216\n00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:53.217\nSo if we refresh and I click them and\n\n217\n00:12:53.217 --> 00:12:57.779\nthere's, I'm hitting Space but\nit's not working.\n\n218\n00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:00.435\nWe've changed how we handle\nthese keyboard events.\n\n219\n00:13:00.435 --> 00:13:05.818\nLet's kind of look at this key,\nAnd refresh.\n\n220\n00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:09.530\nOkay, that's kind of weird.\n\n221\n00:13:11.817 --> 00:13:13.737\nIt's just saying it's blank.\n\n222\n00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:16.350\nWell, it's actually giving\nyou the space character.\n\n223\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.899\nIt's a space.\n\n224\n00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:22.578\nWhich is kinda odd cuz arrow right,\narrow left but\n\n225\n00:13:22.578 --> 00:13:25.566\nthen the space is actually just a space.\n\n226\n00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:30.087\nSo, that's kind of a weirdness, I would\nprobably went with a spelled out like,\n\n227\n00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:31.027\nwhat am I doing?\n\n228\n00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:31.561\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n229\n00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:36.638\n&gt;&gt; But, we gotta deal with\nthe API that we're dealt.\n\n230\n00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:39.163\nAnd then, firing away, firing away and\n\n231\n00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:44.595\nthen we can remove this other console.log\nup here and refresh and we're just firing.\n\n232\n00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:46.483\nSo this would be firing how much pellets?\n\n233\n00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:51.093\nOkay, now what this means is I should be\n\n234\n00:13:51.093 --> 00:13:56.123\nable to construct a pellet\nbased on the x and\n\n235\n00:13:56.123 --> 00:14:00.475\ny position of the fighter, I think.\n\n236\n00:14:00.475 --> 00:14:06.510\nSo pellet equals a new pellet,\n\n237\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:12.319\nfighter.x and fighter.y.\n\n238\n00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:17.021\nOkay, so now I'm passing in\nthe fighter's position to the pellet,\n\n239\n00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:18.326\nin order to [SOUND].\n\n240\n00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:22.424\nAll right, so refresh and there's our\npellet, and there's our pellet, and\n\n241\n00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:23.616\nthere's our pellet.\n\n242\n00:14:27.072 --> 00:14:31.766\nThat's kinda weird, you would think\nthat they wouldn't come back.\n\n243\n00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:37.495\nBut if we zoom in and we actually look,\nthere still is some weirdness as well.\n\n244\n00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:38.231\nSee where it's shooting?\n\n245\n00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:40.684\nIt's actually shooting from the left.\n\n246\n00:14:40.684 --> 00:14:45.155\nI would probably like for it to shoot from\nthe center and not just to materialize.\n\n247\n00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:47.733\nIt's kinda flickering in\nbecause it's appearing and\n\n248\n00:14:47.733 --> 00:14:50.656\nthen being painting in the next frame and\nit kinda just [NOISE].\n\n249\n00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:56.648\nI would like probably to start at\nthe center and come up from behind just so\n\n250\n00:14:56.648 --> 00:15:01.182\nit produces forth, so\nwe gotta do a little bit of math.\n\n251\n00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:04.734\nAll right, well,\nhow are we going to do this?\n\n252\n00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:12.190\nI'm thinking here we just\nsay- fighter.width / 2.\n\n253\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:12.979\nOr no.\n\n254\n00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:15.870\nPlus, excuse me.\n\n255\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.552\nPlus likewise, And\n\n256\n00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:26.527\nwe wanna say plus\nfighter.height divide by 2.\n\n257\n00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:31.028\nOkay, and there we go.\n\n258\n00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:35.273\nAnd it's still not exactly correct.\n\n259\n00:15:35.273 --> 00:15:39.525\nAnd that's because we're doing\nthe left-hand corner of the pellet.\n\n260\n00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:42.693\nSo we should actually move\nback by the pellet amount, but\n\n261\n00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:46.457\nwe haven't constructed the pellet\nuntil we construct the pellet.\n\n262\n00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:47.950\nWe'll leave that be.\n\n263\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.343\nIn other words, it's not behind,\nwhy is it not behind?\n\n264\n00:15:52.343 --> 00:15:54.987\nWell if we come back down here,\n\n265\n00:15:54.987 --> 00:16:00.385\nnotice where pellet.render is\nIt's after everything else.\n\n266\n00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:01.917\nLet's move this up.\n\n267\n00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:05.660\nAnd see if that stacks\nthe layers differently.\n\n268\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.166\nSo refresh and now,\nwe actually have what we anticipate.\n\n269\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:18.294\nProduces four I think except we still have\nthis like a rapid fire shot that exist.\n\n270\n00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:20.600\nBut if I just let it go,\nit does your port.\n\n271\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.350\nNow, that one pellet and you're like well,\nlooks like we have a bunch of them.\n\n272\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.520\nActually, the other one kinda disappears.\n\n273\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.903\nIt goes away.\n\n274\n00:16:28.903 --> 00:16:31.128\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; So at this point Justin,\n\n275\n00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:32.320\nwe have one pellet, right?\n\n276\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.250\n&gt;&gt; And that we have exactly one pellet and\nit's not a great defense.\n\n277\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:42.755\nHowever, we would be capable of testing\nthat a pellet can hit an attacker.\n\n278\n00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, but\nit's kinda like all or nothing.\n\n279\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.030\nI mean, we're gonna have\na bunch of attackers, right?\n\n280\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.160\nSo shouldn't we have\na plethora of pellets?\n\n281\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.410\n&gt;&gt; We should, so here's my plan of action.\n\n282\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Here's my plan of action.\n\n283\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:59.196\nI think if we can make sure that the\ncurrent one pellet hits the attacker and\n\n284\n00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.829\nkinda removes itself.\n\n285\n00:17:02.802 --> 00:17:05.090\nThen we can worry about a bunch of them,\nright?\n\n286\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.150\nBecause that's\nan interaction that we need.\n\n287\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n288\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.630\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's get that and\n\n289\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.740\nthen we'll have to do\nsome changiality stuff.\n\n290\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n291\n00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.020\n&gt;&gt; So I think right now I'm gonna\nmake the attackers stationary just so\n\n292\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.090\nI could test this.\n\n293\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:22.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n294\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.780\n&gt;&gt; And here we go.\n\n295\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.060\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n296\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.710\nWe're going to comment that out,\nand there we go.\n\n297\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.540\nSo now I can [SOUND]\nokay.\n\n298\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.203\nSo during kind of our main\ngame loop our update,\n\n299\n00:17:45.203 --> 00:17:50.457\nwhat I'm wanting is,\nif the pellet is there, move.\n\n300\n00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:55.498\nBut also somewhere in here,\n\n301\n00:17:55.498 --> 00:18:03.068\nif(pellet.hits)(attacker)){.\n\n302\n00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:07.680\nJust like that, then attacker = null;.\n\n303\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.534\nNot the greatest .we'll\ndefinitely fix that.\n\n304\n00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:10.725\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n305\n00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:14.867\n&gt;&gt; Also the pellet = null;.\n\n306\n00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:18.906\nWe just [SOUND] wouldn't\nwant to remove it, okay.\n\n307\n00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:20.686\nNow this pellet.hits doesn't exist.\n\n308\n00:18:20.686 --> 00:18:23.815\nLet's go ahead and add that.\n\n309\n00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:30.880\nNow how this hits is going\nto be a little complicated.\n\n310\n00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So this hits(other).\n\n311\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.770\nNow what is this other?\n\n312\n00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.294\nThat's something else on the screen.\n\n313\n00:18:35.294 --> 00:18:36.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n\n314\n00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.037\n&gt;&gt; Let's return this.\n\n315\n00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:47.510\nI'm thinking if we move up, right.\n\n316\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.170\nAnd the first thing to\nencounter is the y position of\n\n317\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.740\nthe attacker and it's high, right,\nwe're gonna hit that first edge.\n\n318\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.770\nWe wanna test to see if the y value is\ngreater than or equal to that, right.\n\n319\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.410\nAlso we need to make sure that\nit's within the x position.\n\n320\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.061\nSo that the x is within the attacker's x.\n\n321\n00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:19.357\nIt's greater than or equal to the x,\nor that it's greater than,\n\n322\n00:19:19.357 --> 00:19:22.534\nand the hit box is off just a little bit,\n\n323\n00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:27.180\nor it's less than or\nequal to the x position on the right.\n\n324\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.741\nSo with that said, let's spherical thing\n\n325\n00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:37.300\nare so much easier to determine hits.\n\n326\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.200\nBecause you can say, what's\nthe distance between the two centers?\n\n327\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.650\nIs that less than the sum of the radii?\n\n328\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.087\nIf it is, then they hit, if they not,\n\n329\n00:19:47.087 --> 00:19:51.904\nhave different dimensions with [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I see around\n\n330\n00:19:51.904 --> 00:19:54.592\nmy eyes everyday is in the morning.\n\n331\n00:19:54.592 --> 00:19:57.510\n&gt;&gt; You should probably get\nthat checked out, but [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.880\nSo to be with an x, we're gonna\nsay that this pellet's x, right.\n\n333\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.240\nIs greater than or equal to the other's x.\n\n334\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.251\nOkay, and that's gonna be the left\nhand side of the pellet now we\n\n335\n00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:17.035\nwould if we have to adjust that\nto get a more accurate hit box.\n\n336\n00:20:17.035 --> 00:20:21.441\nBut I think this is a good\nfirst approximation.\n\n337\n00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:26.403\nAnd, has be an and, and this x is,\ncuz otherwise it would be as\n\n338\n00:20:26.403 --> 00:20:30.705\nlong as to the right,\nregardless of weather it hits.\n\n339\n00:20:30.705 --> 00:20:33.870\nThis pellet's x is less than or\n\n340\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:39.390\nequal to the other's x +\nthe other's width, okay.\n\n341\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.420\nAnd then withInY = okay\n\n342\n00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.959\nwait for it, wait for it.\n\n343\n00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:54.963\nThis pellet's y,\n\n344\n00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:59.342\n&gt;= other.y +\n\n345\n00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:04.667\nother.height;.\n\n346\n00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:06.037\nI think that'll do.\n\n347\n00:21:06.037 --> 00:21:10.439\nAnd then return withInX &amp;&amp; withInY.\n\n348\n00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:13.960\nSo let's go back through this mixture and\nmake sure our logic's solid here.\n\n349\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n350\n00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.818\nWe're to the right or the left side and\n\n351\n00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:24.162\nwe're to the left of the right side\nof the enemy, right of the attacker.\n\n352\n00:21:24.162 --> 00:21:25.067\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n\n353\n00:21:25.067 --> 00:21:30.802\n&gt;&gt; But also or y position is at\nleast to the bottom edge and\n\n354\n00:21:30.802 --> 00:21:36.155\nthat way if it moves into it,\nit should still hit,\n\n355\n00:21:36.155 --> 00:21:40.234\nDo we need to check if it's less than,\n\n356\n00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:47.025\nactually I think we should check\nto see if it's also less than.\n\n357\n00:21:47.025 --> 00:21:48.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n358\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Because otherwise, I think what'll\nhappen is the pellet will move by and\n\n359\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.502\nthen [SOUND] and\nthen it'll actually shoot from behind.\n\n360\n00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.050\nAnd that's a weird dynamic.\n\n361\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.699\nNot saying this wouldn't really happen but\n\n362\n00:22:00.699 --> 00:22:05.610\njust to be safe &amp;&amp; this.y &lt;= other.y;.\n\n363\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.645\nSo does it lie within\nthe attacker's bounding box?\n\n364\n00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:10.145\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n365\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see,\nwhat do we wanna do if it hits, right?\n\n366\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.630\nWe wanna do this.\n\n367\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.860\nWe should remove them from the screen.\n\n368\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.130\nSo if we refresh and.\n\n369\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Something broke.\n\n370\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.430\n&gt;&gt; Pellet hits.\n\n371\n00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.640\nYou know what?\n\n372\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.220\nYou have to check, because our pellet is\ncurrently undefined at the beginning.\n\n373\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n374\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.500\n&gt;&gt; If there is a pellet and this is\na way of saying I'm gonna do this and\n\n375\n00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.920\nthis and if the pellet's not defined\nit won't try the second part.\n\n376\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.736\nThis is some java script shenanigans.\n\n377\n00:22:46.736 --> 00:22:51.279\nAll right, so I move over [SOUND].\n\n378\n00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:54.034\nWe got some logic errors here.\n\n379\n00:22:54.034 --> 00:22:58.884\nLet's just make sure,\n\n380\n00:22:58.884 --> 00:23:04.467\nsee, console.log here.\n\n381\n00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:08.640\nAll right, so liberally placed\nconsole.logs will help us.\n\n382\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.520\nAnd it's not so our logic that we've\nmessed something up on our logic.\n\n383\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.430\nAnd these are always rough for\nme, admittedly so.\n\n384\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moments.\n\n385\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.400\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moments.\n\n386\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.260\nIf we come up here, all right.\n\n387\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.000\nSo let's think about this.\n\n388\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.950\nIf it hits the other, then the pellet's\nx is greater than the other's x.\n\n389\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.190\nThat's to the right.\n\n390\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.831\nAnd it's less than the other's x.\n\n391\n00:23:34.003 --> 00:23:38.500\nPlus the width, that's right.\n\n392\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:44.033\nAnd then the y is greater than the others\n\n393\n00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:48.040\n+ the height which would be down and\nless than the top.\n\n394\n00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.396\nSo let's see.\n\n395\n00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:58.738\nConsole.log('withInX, withinY).\n\n396\n00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:04.610\nAnd we refresh, notice there's\nnothing being printed out here.\n\n397\n00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.110\nAnd we hit.\n\n398\n00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:13.924\nSo our withInY is never turning to true,\n\n399\n00:24:13.924 --> 00:24:19.351\nso that means here, So\n\n400\n00:24:19.351 --> 00:24:23.650\nif we remove this, let's just go\nwith our initial gut instinct.\n\n401\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.970\nMaybe I was overthinking it a little bit,\nso if we refresh this and assignment.\n\n402\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.520\nWell, no,\nthat immediately breaks everything.\n\n403\n00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:43.054\nAnd, this.y is less than or\nequal to the other.y.\n\n404\n00:24:45.522 --> 00:24:49.646\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, is this something where\nthe y position, positive being down,\n\n405\n00:24:49.646 --> 00:24:53.121\nnegative being up,\ncould that be what's causing this issue?\n\n406\n00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:56.483\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach,\nthat's one of the reasons why you're here,\n\n407\n00:24:56.483 --> 00:24:58.710\nyou're here to help me stay on my toes.\n\n408\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I think you might be\n\n409\n00:25:00.522 --> 00:25:02.290\non to something yet again.\n\n410\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.243\nAnd that always trips me up, as most of\nyou as well, can possibly be tripped up,\n\n411\n00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:08.108\nright, positive-\n&gt;&gt; Is down.\n\n412\n00:25:08.108 --> 00:25:11.624\n&gt;&gt; Is down, and\nthen negative is up, and likewise,\n\n413\n00:25:11.624 --> 00:25:17.420\nthat means that adding would go this way,\nbut then subtracting would go this way.\n\n414\n00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.089\n&gt;&gt; Turns you around.\n&gt;&gt; Turns you around, and\n\n415\n00:25:19.089 --> 00:25:20.990\nit's probably best to draw.\n\n416\n00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.780\nBut now that we have Zack on our side,\nI think we can fix this.\n\n417\n00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.270\nSo let's come back and\nactually try that in our code.\n\n418\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.395\nLet's take a look here, and\n\n419\n00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:32.391\nwhat that means is that these\nsigns would be flipped.\n\n420\n00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:37.071\nIs it less than, up, than the bottom edge,\n\n421\n00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:42.007\nand is it greater than or\nequal to the top edge?\n\n422\n00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:46.695\nSo you're right, I think, so\nwe come back here, we refresh,\n\n423\n00:25:46.695 --> 00:25:48.826\nlet's actually come back.\n\n424\n00:25:48.826 --> 00:25:54.560\nOkay, we refreshed, we hit it, boom, and\nthen I actually kind of expected this.\n\n425\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.140\nNotice it's true, true, true,\nhere, here, here, here, here?\n\n426\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.690\nOkay, all right, all right,\nall right, all right, but notice,\n\n427\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.658\nit stopped as soon as it hit,\nthat's actually what we want.\n\n428\n00:26:02.658 --> 00:26:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so assignment constant variable,\n\n429\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.521\nnow, because we're kind of putting things\nin play, and bringing them out of play.\n\n430\n00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:13.209\nconst may not be the best thing for\n\n431\n00:26:13.209 --> 00:26:17.630\nan attacker,\nwe may need to change this to let, okay.\n\n432\n00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.710\nSo we started this attacker, but\nnow we can reassign that variable,\n\n433\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.980\nit's not a const behind it.\n\n434\n00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:30.990\nSo if we come back and we refresh, hits\nedge of null, now why is that happening?\n\n435\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.740\nBecause if we do that,\nkind of our way of removing this is,\n\n436\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.150\nthe attacker is checking,\ndoes it hit the edge?\n\n437\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.954\nWell, if it's null, then it doesn't,\nso we have to put a guard there, and\n\n438\n00:26:44.954 --> 00:26:48.200\nsome of these will go away\nas we change some of this.\n\n439\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.443\nBut I'm a big proponent of making sure we\nunderstand the individual pieces before\n\n440\n00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.110\nwe make large collections.\n\n441\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.420\nSo if you refresh one last time,\nboom, done, now,\n\n442\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.490\nwhy do we have one final render issue?\n\n443\n00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:08.144\nAnd that's because we now need to say\nif(attacker), render the attacker.\n\n444\n00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:12.190\nOkay, so we have a lot of extra code here\nthat maybe we won't need in the long term.\n\n445\n00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:18.420\nBut we wanna make sure this interaction\nworks, and now that pellet, boom.\n\n446\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.775\nAnd notice also,\nwhen it got removed, that stopped,\n\n447\n00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:26.952\nlet's remove that console.log just for\nfunsies.\n\n448\n00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:30.745\nOkay, here we go, and\nnow we can actually attack back,\n\n449\n00:27:30.745 --> 00:27:35.450\nremove the attacker from the board,\nit's gone, we're good to go.\n\n450\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.270\n&gt;&gt; We need to defend ourselves.\n\n451\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.760\n&gt;&gt; And we've defended ourselves,\nand there you go, Zach.\n\n452\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.170\nWe have our attacker, but\nwe do need a collection.\n\n453\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.730\nWe need a bunch of them,\nwe need a bunch of pellets.\n\n454\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.010\nLet's worry about\nthe bunch of pellets first,\n\n455\n00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:53.510\nbecause that's gonna be something that\nmay be best monitored by the game.\n\n456\n00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.810\nI'm pretty sure we don't have time on this\nepisode, so let's come back with a part\n\n457\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.050\ntwo, because I say I'm gonna\ncreate the pellets, all of them.\n\n458\n00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.240\n&gt;&gt; Now it's plural.\n&gt;&gt; Right, pellets with an s.\n\n459\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.275\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; We'll come back and see that,\n\n460\n00:28:04.275 --> 00:28:09.170\nit may not take too long of a time, but\nthat way, we can give its full attention.\n\n461\n00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.510\nGot one working, we know the attacker,\nthey hit the attacker,\n\n462\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.970\nand we can do logic based on that.\n\n463\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.150\nBut we need a bunch of them, and that way,\n\n464\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.740\nwe don't have that weird short fire burst\ntype thing, but definitely stay tuned.\n\n465\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.569\n&gt;&gt; Another awesome episode Justin,\ncreating the pellets part one.\n\n466\n00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:31.240\nThere will be creating the pellets part\ntwo, so you'll want to see both of those,\n\n467\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.050\nJustin, any final thoughts?\n\n468\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are now gonna\nstart moving into collections,\n\n469\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.520\nright, and we may just keep it\nvery simple, or, who knows?\n\n470\n00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.619\nWe may get into some more of those\nabstractions that Zach is always kind of\n\n471\n00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:45.795\npoking my shoulder.\n\n472\n00:28:45.795 --> 00:28:46.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n\n473\n00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:51.820\ncan you make this not do duplicative,\nis that a word?\n\n474\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna make it up.\n\n475\n00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.225\n&gt;&gt; Duplicative.\n\n476\n00:28:54.225 --> 00:28:59.026\n&gt;&gt; Duplicative, well, who knows,\nwe'll probably start simple, build up.\n\n477\n00:28:59.026 --> 00:29:00.605\nBut definitely stay tuned,\n\n478\n00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:04.238\nbecause you probably want a gun\nthat shoots more than one pellet.\n\n479\n00:29:04.238 --> 00:29:09.289\n&gt;&gt; That's true, but creating\nthe pellets part two is coming up,\n\n480\n00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:12.360\nwe had creating the pellets part one.\n\n481\n00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.940\nI'm having trouble talking because I'm\nthinking about pellets shooting at\n\n482\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.720\nattackers.\n\n483\n00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.510\nAnd I can't wait to see more,\nand I know you can't either.\n\n484\n00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.440\nSo make sure you watch every\nepisode of HTML5 Canvas projects.\n\n485\n00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.366\nAnd go to our content library\nto see all the videos there,\n\n486\n00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:30.580\nbecause they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n487\n00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.940\nAnd thank you for watching DevPro TV,\nmake sure tell a friend about DevPro TV,\n\n488\n00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.620\nthey'll be very happy you did,\nthanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n489\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.362\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n490\n00:29:38.362 --> 00:29:42.684\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hi, good to see you as well, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.000\nAnd how are you today?\n\n11\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited because this\nis getting a lot more fun.\n\n12\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.200\nNow that we move forward in\ncreating this game so to speak.\n\n13\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.014\nI'm gonna call it a game anyway.\n\n14\n00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:45.671\nNow we had a pellet that we ended\nup with in the last episode, but\n\n15\n00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:50.170\nwe need a bunch of pellets cuz we're\ngonna have a bunch of attackers, right?\n\n16\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.125\n&gt;&gt; Right, right now we have\na very important line of,\n\n17\n00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.928\nit's better than it was, but\nwe have a very poor line of defense.\n\n18\n00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:59.750\nWe need the ability to\nshoot multiple pellets.\n\n19\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.759\nBecause ultimately,\nwe're gonna have multiple attackers-\n\n20\n00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:02.338\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n21\n00:01:02.338 --> 00:01:04.604\n&gt;&gt; In our game, our attack.\n\n22\n00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:07.680\n&gt;&gt; And also the pellets should have the\nability to fire all over the canvas, too.\n\n23\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n24\n00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:15.680\nSo I think right we're gonna limit it to\nup and down but we need a bunch of them.\n\n25\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.389\nBecause I can move left and\nright with my fighter and\n\n26\n00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.680\nthen it originates from\nthe fighter's position.\n\n27\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.610\nThough we can fire up and\ndown all over the place.\n\n28\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.800\nBut right now we're getting one and\nhit the space bar a bunch of times,\n\n29\n00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.230\nit just kind of responds back to itself.\n\n30\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.214\nNow with that comes the management\nof multiple pellets.\n\n31\n00:01:32.214 --> 00:01:33.955\nWe have to be careful.\n\n32\n00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:38.148\nBut I think I'm gonna keep that\nkind of the simple way, and\n\n33\n00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:43.026\nlet the game manage the list of\npellets that the array, if you will,\n\n34\n00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:46.210\nthe JavaScript array of pellets.\n\n35\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.710\nAnd then that way,\nwe can let what we need to build fall out.\n\n36\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.700\nBut we want to get all of those done.\n\n37\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.010\nSo, let's take a look here,\nand what do we have?\n\n38\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.210\nWe're checking if a pellet, and we had to\nadd some of these because we're removing\n\n39\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.830\nthe attacker that currently exists,\nthe only attacker.\n\n40\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.669\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nlet the attacker start moving again.\n\n41\n00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:06.396\nThat's just not fair.\n\n42\n00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:09.849\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if attacker and\n\n43\n00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.139\nattacker hits edge\nhere's the trick though,\n\n44\n00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:21.410\nif I remove the attacker then this gets\na little else if attacker, there we go.\n\n45\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.620\nSo we're gonna let them move.\n\n46\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.130\nOtherwise it's just not gonna do anything.\n\n47\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.807\nAnd ultimately that would change cuz\nwe're gonna have a bunch of attackers as\n\n48\n00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:29.850\nwe've talked about.\n\n49\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.630\nBut how do I get a bunch of pellets.\n\n50\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.310\nOkay, how do I get a great deal of\npellets, well if we come up here and\n\n51\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.940\ninstead of a single pellet I'm\nthinking we just say pellets,\n\n52\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.020\nand that's an empty array, just like that.\n\n53\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.940\nAnd here we create a pellet inside of\nthe context of the switch statement.\n\n54\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.478\nAnd then we just add that to\nthe pellets array, like so,\n\n55\n00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:04.770\npellets.push(pellet), you're like okay,\nI got it, I think it works.\n\n56\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.994\nWe come back and you refresh it's\na whole bunch of broke, isn't it.\n\n57\n00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:13.711\nAnd that's because well, we have a pellet\n[INAUDIBLE] well it's not pellet anymore,\n\n58\n00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:14.640\nit's pellets.\n\n59\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.841\nThe first thing people will do is,\nwell it's an array so\n\n60\n00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.440\nthat I don't have to\ncheck if it's an array.\n\n61\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.400\nAnd I get to say,\npellets.render got you in.\n\n62\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.322\nI can say pellet, I don't really need\nthis and, they'll just start adding Ss,\n\n63\n00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:34.829\nand I'm not saying I've been guilty\nof this but I've been guilty of this.\n\n64\n00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.759\n&gt;&gt;

All right.\n&gt;&gt; So if there's an attacker and\n\n179\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.600\na pellet hits the attacker, what we\nwant to do is say pellets.splice().\n\n180\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.250\nNow I'm not big on mutation but\nsometimes it's necessary,\n\n181\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.700\nespecially if you just wanna kinda\nkeep a queue or collection in and out.\n\n182\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.420\nSo what splice will do is\nlook up to that position and\n\n183\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.640\nremove that amount from that position.\n\n184\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.320\nSo if the pellet is at the third\nposition in the list, and\n\n185\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.408\nyou put one,\nit's gonna remove the third one.\n\n186\n00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:58.221\nBoom, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.779\nNow we have to be careful here,\nwe may have to tweak this because as we're\n\n188\n00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:05.638\nmoving forward if we\nremove we may skip some.\n\n189\n00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:12.516\nSo right now I'm using forEach,\nwe'll stay with that for now.\n\n190\n00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:15.458\nBut where do I get this index?\n\n191\n00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:18.930\nWell, this forEach actually\ngives us the pellet and\n\n192\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.770\nwill give us the index for each pellet.\n\n193\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.388\nSo it gives us the object and\nthe index where it lies in the array.\n\n194\n00:11:25.388 --> 00:11:30.991\nSo now we should be able\nto remove this accordingly.\n\n195\n00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.415\nThere we go and if you, over here,\nboom, now it removes and\n\n196\n00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:40.740\nthat's what we anticipated would happen or\nhoped would happen.\n\n197\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.618\nAnd there we go we have\na bunch of pellets.\n\n198\n00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:46.346\nThough one final thing though,\nis we still have those eight pellets.\n\n199\n00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:49.560\nWe should probably remove\nthose if they're offspring.\n\n200\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.550\nIf they're out of bounds so to speak.\n\n201\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.000\nSo where would we do that?\n\n202\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.383\nWell in update,\nI think update's a good place.\n\n203\n00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:02.327\nAnd as a matter of fact we should\nprobably just put it right here\n\n204\n00:12:02.327 --> 00:12:05.572\ninside of this for loop, this forEach.\n\n205\n00:12:05.572 --> 00:12:09.885\nBut we need to do that,\nlet's say outOfBounds, and\n\n206\n00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:16.353\nthis is gonna be very similar to the hits\nedge, we wanna see if it hits the edge,\n\n207\n00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:20.389\nbut here we wanna see if\nit's just out of bounds.\n\n208\n00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:21.096\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n209\n00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:25.320\n&gt;&gt; Or we could put out of the atmosphere.\n\n210\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.970\nOut of bounds, and\nthen what is the boundary?\n\n211\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.030\nAnd then, if we return this.y, and\n\n212\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.110\nI just like to put that to think about it,\nbut we don't need it in this case.\n\n213\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.946\nIf it's less than or equal to 0,\nbecause y is the top.\n\n214\n00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:45.831\nSo it's out of bounds on the top.\n\n215\n00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:51.022\nIf was moving in another direction,\nthen that would make sense.\n\n216\n00:12:51.022 --> 00:12:55.725\nActually, let's- intoOrbit.\n\n217\n00:12:58.722 --> 00:13:00.390\nOr how about isInOrbit.\n\n218\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.930\nIf it goes into orbit let's remove it,\nI think that's a little more of\n\n219\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.660\na descriptive and\nadds a nice touch of readability.\n\n220\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.824\nSo if we came down here and now for\neach pellet if there's an attacker and\n\n221\n00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:14.745\nthe pellet hits the attacker, remove it.\n\n222\n00:13:14.745 --> 00:13:16.947\nIf that is not the case,\n\n223\n00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:28.561\nIf the pallet is in\norbit then we also want\n\n224\n00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:34.620\nto remove that pellet from the list.\n\n225\n00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.424\nSo once it goes off screen,\nit will be removed.\n\n226\n00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:42.551\nSo I actually have to focus,\n\n227\n00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:47.685\nboom, and then there we go.\n\n228\n00:13:47.685 --> 00:13:52.120\nNow if we look at pellets, it's now\nempty because it's removing from itself.\n\n229\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.353\nAs I said, we may encounter some issues,\ncuz I'm using a forEach to\n\n230\n00:13:55.353 --> 00:13:58.280\nmake sure we don't have over-runs or\nout of bounds errors.\n\n231\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.765\nBut we can run into some issues\nlike you're mutating an array.\n\n232\n00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.948\n&gt;&gt; So if you remove the element\nthat you just iterated on,\n\n234\n00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:13.320\nthat position will actually\nbe kind of moved back down.\n\n235\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.487\nSo sometimes moving forward through there,\nand I would have to double check.\n\n236\n00:14:17.487 --> 00:14:20.937\nWe're gonna leave it be cuz forEach\nmay handle that behind the scenes,\n\n237\n00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:21.866\nit kinda depends.\n\n238\n00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:23.316\nWe're not gonna worry about it for\n\n239\n00:14:23.316 --> 00:14:25.618\nnow, but it is something to\nkeep in the back of my mind.\n\n240\n00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:26.640\nBut there you have it Zach,\n\n241\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.781\nwe actually have the ability\nto shoot a bunch of pellets.\n\n242\n00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:31.242\nAnd as a matter of fact,\n\n243\n00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:36.043\nwe can just hold down-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] It seems like a very easy win\n\n244\n00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:36.754\nthough.\n\n245\n00:14:36.754 --> 00:14:39.379\n&gt;&gt; It does seem like a very easy win.\n\n246\n00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.065\n&gt;&gt; So shouldn't we change that so you know\nthere's a little competition going on.\n\n247\n00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:45.548\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't think this is\nreal fair to the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n248\n00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:48.093\nCuz I don't even really need to move now,\nI just hold it down, right?\n\n249\n00:14:48.093 --> 00:14:48.648\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n250\n00:14:48.648 --> 00:14:51.296\n&gt;&gt; So Zach, I will let you choose.\n\n251\n00:14:51.296 --> 00:14:55.911\nSo one of these old nostalgia arcade\ngames, a lot of times, when you were able\n\n252\n00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:57.869\nto fire pellets like this-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n253\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.490\n&gt;&gt; What would happen is, you would be\nlimited to, like, two on screen at a time.\n\n254\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.727\nSo I'm thinking two, three on screen.\n\n255\n00:15:08.727 --> 00:15:10.432\nWhich is your favorite number,\ntwo or three?\n\n256\n00:15:10.432 --> 00:15:11.070\n&gt;&gt; Three, sir.\n\n257\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna go with three.\n\n258\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.760\nWe're gonna limit it to three\npellets at a time on the screen.\n\n259\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.220\nNow what that means is is we're\ngonna fire again as soon as it hits,\n\n260\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.030\nbecause those are gonna be\nremoved from the array.\n\n261\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n262\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.500\n&gt;&gt; Also,\nas soon as the one goes out of bounds,\n\n263\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.470\nwe're gonna be able to do that as well.\n\n264\n00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:31.510\nThat seems like a rough thing like,\nthis is gonna take a lot of work.\n\n265\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.068\nI think we're actually gonna be all right,\ncuz all we're gonna need to do is\n\n266\n00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:37.915\ncheck the length and\nthen only execute the spacebar action.\n\n267\n00:15:37.915 --> 00:15:41.012\nIf the length is less than the limit.\n\n268\n00:15:41.012 --> 00:15:41.767\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n269\n00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n270\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.549\nNow, we're just gonna hardcode this\nvalue for now, but I would probably pull\n\n271\n00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:50.369\nthis out until maybe a configuration\nconstant or something like that.\n\n272\n00:15:50.369 --> 00:15:53.925\nBut let's go ahead and do that, I don't\nthink that will be too hard and then I\n\n273\n00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:57.593\nthink we'll have a whole bunch of pellets-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] the pellets.\n\n274\n00:15:57.593 --> 00:16:01.613\n&gt;&gt; At least for now, we may see an\nabstraction follow this in a later time,\n\n275\n00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:03.627\nbut it may make a little more sense.\n\n276\n00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:06.957\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look back at the screen and\n\n277\n00:16:06.957 --> 00:16:11.619\nlet's make sure we've had a bunch of\ntimes I've shot a bunch of pellets and\n\n278\n00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:15.188\nit's still zero and\nI can just [SOUND] just hammer away at.\n\n279\n00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:19.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So [CROSSTALK] the attacker moving and\n\n280\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.011\nthe attacker hitting the edge,\nit still does that.\n\n281\n00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:25.113\nWe'll leave that.\n\n282\n00:16:25.113 --> 00:16:30.157\nBut I only want this\n\n283\n00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:34.572\nportion to occur\n\n284\n00:16:34.572 --> 00:16:43.093\nif(pellets.length &lt; 2).\n\n285\n00:16:43.093 --> 00:16:46.505\nLess than or equal to 0,1,\n\n286\n00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:51.288\nactually, let's just say less than 2.\n\n287\n00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:54.810\nThen do this.\n\n288\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.972\nSo, this is only allowed if there's\nnot already two pellets in the list,\n\n289\n00:17:03.972 --> 00:17:07.493\nwhich means there's two\npellets on the screen.\n\n290\n00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:10.808\nSo, if we look there and we refresh.\n\n291\n00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:18.552\nNotice it only allows me\nto shoot two at a time and\n\n292\n00:17:18.552 --> 00:17:22.532\nthen I can shoot again as\nsoon as it hits the attacker.\n\n293\n00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:23.186\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n294\n00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:25.521\n&gt;&gt; So that was actually a pretty easy fix.\n\n295\n00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:29.021\nNow, I'm using a raw JavaScript array,\njust to handle these and\n\n296\n00:17:29.021 --> 00:17:30.750\nmanage these in a global state.\n\n297\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.850\nThat may have to change a little bit,\nin due time.\n\n298\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.240\nBut for now, we're just gonna leave that.\n\n299\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.632\nWe have a bunch of pellets, and\nthat actually leads us into,\n\n300\n00:17:38.632 --> 00:17:42.990\nI could probably create a bunch\nof attackers that way, right?\n\n301\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.330\nProbably, but we need some more\ninformation about the attacker.\n\n302\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.870\nThis is a good start, but\n\n303\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.600\nour attackers are gonna be\na little more complex than that.\n\n304\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.740\nAnd we should probably do a little\nbit of cleanup in this file.\n\n305\n00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.335\nThis file is getting fairly large, kind of\nbig, and a lot of issues with the reading.\n\n306\n00:17:57.335 --> 00:18:00.278\nSo I would do a little bit of cleanup,\nlittle bit of refactor,\n\n307\n00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:03.957\nactually formalize this game and\nthen we're gonna move on to our attackers,\n\n308\n00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:06.013\nand then it's gonna turn into a real game.\n\n309\n00:18:06.013 --> 00:18:09.223\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's episode two\nof creating the pellets.\n\n310\n00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:10.219\nWe had episode one.\n\n311\n00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:10.882\nSee them both.\n\n312\n00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:11.797\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n313\n00:18:11.797 --> 00:18:12.703\nAny last words?\n\n314\n00:18:12.703 --> 00:18:17.326\n&gt;&gt; Well, definitely stay tuned, because\nI'm thinking once we get our general game\n\n315\n00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:20.083\ndynamics down,\nmaybe we'll add some sprites.\n\n316\n00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:23.363\nSo they're not just blocks,\nmaybe they're actually images,\n\n317\n00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:25.560\nwhich can become a little more difficult.\n\n318\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.184\n&gt;&gt; Baby ducks?\n\n319\n00:18:26.184 --> 00:18:28.017\n&gt;&gt; We could do baby ducks.\n\n320\n00:18:28.017 --> 00:18:29.517\nAttack of the baby ducks.\n\n321\n00:18:29.517 --> 00:18:31.792\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like evil ducks.\n\n322\n00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.311\n&gt;&gt; Are any ducks evil?\n\n323\n00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:35.137\nI'm not sure.\n\n324\n00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:36.332\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, who knows.\n\n325\n00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:40.541\n&gt;&gt; They are very territorial though,\nmaybe not the baby ones.\n\n326\n00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:47.307\nBut maybe we'll add some sprites, maybe\nwe add some other things, some niceties,\n\n327\n00:18:47.307 --> 00:18:53.710\nbut also maybe we add the ability to\nhave different difficulty levels, right?\n\n328\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is one of those things where as\n\n329\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.234\nyou play the [CROSSTALK] just get faster-\n&gt;&gt; Gets harder and harder.\n\n330\n00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:02.665\n&gt;&gt; Okay, in addition to there's a few\ncontrol tweaks that I wanna do.\n\n331\n00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:05.972\nI don't necessarily like hitting\nbuttons every time in order to move but\n\n332\n00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:07.705\nwe're gonna stay with that for now but\n\n333\n00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:10.052\ndefinitely stay tuned\nthere's a lot more coming.\n\n334\n00:19:10.052 --> 00:19:15.760\nAs we see this evolve into a more full\nfledged maybe nicer looking game.\n\n335\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.060\n&gt;&gt; Well the entire series of\nHTML5 Canvas projects is exciting, and\n\n336\n00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.850\nit's getting better and better and better.\n\n337\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.870\nWatch every single one.\n\n338\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.570\nAnd also, go to our course library, check\nout all the hundreds of videos there,\n\n339\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.470\nare all designed to help you go further.\n\n340\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.090\nHey, and tell everyone you know about\nDEVPRO.TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n341\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.002\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n342\n00:19:32.002 --> 00:19:32.851\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.857\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:18.105\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n5\n00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.939\nAnd you're watching\nHTML 5 Canvas Projects.\n\n6\n00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.254\nAnd this is cleaning up and\nrefactoring for this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:28.205\nAnd bringing us the information we need\nis the one and only Dev Pro IT Expert,\n\n8\n00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:29.211\nJustin Dennison.\n\n9\n00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:30.620\nJustin, good to see you, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.403\n&gt;&gt; It is good to see you as well, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:35.600\nAnd after that introduction, I don't know\nif we should even continue this episode.\n\n12\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.470\nI'm like, well, that made me sound\namazing, so we're just gonna go on.\n\n13\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But how are you today, Zach?\n\n14\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing very well.\n\n15\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200\nI'm excited,\nthis has been a wonderful series.\n\n16\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.790\nAnd you said last time, the last episode,\nwe were gonna be cleaning up and\n\n17\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.590\nrefactoring.\n\n18\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.010\nSo first of all, what does that mean and\nwhat do we have to do first?\n\n19\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.230\n&gt;&gt; So cleaning up and refractor.\n\n20\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.090\nRight now, that file, our app.js,\n\n21\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320\nit pretty much has everything we've\nbeen doing in our code, right?\n\n22\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080\nIt's all there.\n\n23\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.943\nThat may be hard times for\nmaintainability.\n\n24\n00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:05.638\nSo we're just gonna clean it up so\nwe have this separation of the fighters in\n\n25\n00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:08.410\nthe fighter file,\nthe attackers in the attacker file.\n\n26\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.268\nAnd maybe we should pull that into a game\nobject, so we're not gonna be polluting\n\n27\n00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:16.750\nthe global name space, and we don't have\nto reset all these variables and things.\n\n28\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.730\nIn addition to,\n\n29\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.870\nthere's probably going to be a few\nchanges to the code during that process.\n\n30\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.880\nSo during the cleanup,\n\n31\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020\nsometimes we have change some of the code\nin order to make the cleanup work.\n\n32\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.330\nBecause we're changing the structure,\n\n33\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.270\nwe're refactoring how\nthings are structured.\n\n34\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.990\nSo that's ultimately what we have to do.\n\n35\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.490\nSo yeah, I think we should probably\ngo ahead and get started with that.\n\n36\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.365\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of talking.\n\n37\n00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:43.790\nBut well, what is it gonna be.\n\n38\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.560\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here, and\n\n39\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.180\nsee all of that fun\ncode that we have here.\n\n40\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.885\n&gt;&gt; But it is pretty.\n\n41\n00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.820\n&gt;&gt; And it is pretty.\nI like the syntax highlighting.\n\n42\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.590\nSo here's what I am talking about like\nwe have these global names spaces and\n\n43\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.600\nto some extent these are always\ngoing to be globally\n\n44\n00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600\nname space because they\nhave to be available.\n\n45\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.410\nNow there is a way with ES6,\nthe new of JavaScript features or\n\n46\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.690\nthe build system, and even newer versions\nof browsers where it doesn't have to\n\n47\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.320\nbelong to the name space, it can be\nkind of sequestered away in a module.\n\n48\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.740\nBut we're kind of give and take here.\n\n49\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.780\nWe're using some new features, but we're\nnot gonna be able to use all of them.\n\n50\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.300\nJust, it's kind of a compromise between\nwhat's easy for everybody to follow along,\n\n51\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.930\nnot necessarily what I\nwould do ultimately.\n\n52\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.497\nSo, we have these global name spaces,\nthere's Fighter and Attacker and Pellet.\n\n53\n00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:37.387\nAnd these really should be\nin their own file, right?\n\n54\n00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:40.380\nThey shouldn't be in this file.\n\n55\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.930\nAll our definitions, everything.\n\n56\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.370\nIt's 134 lines of code.\n\n57\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.180\nThat's not bad.\n\n58\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.250\nBut if you keep adding.\n\n59\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.140\nI wanna add these features.\n\n60\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.580\nI want different types of Attackers,\n\n61\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.895\ndifferent types of Pellets,\ndifferent kind of Fighters.\n\n62\n00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.457\nNow I have to add game logic cuz currently\nour game logic is fairly simple.\n\n63\n00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:03.440\nIt's right here, we have update and\nit just updates everything, right?\n\n64\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.070\nWhich may continue to change\nas we add additional features.\n\n65\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.450\nAnd then main.\n\n66\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.460\nWell, it is request for\nthe next paint and update and render.\n\n67\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.500\nThat's not bad, but there's no telling\nhow complex this needs to get eventually.\n\n68\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.800\nSo maybe we kinda sequestered all four, at\nleast remove all the other noise from it.\n\n69\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.750\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n70\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.480\nI'm gonna open up my little side bar here\nand right here I have this js folder.\n\n71\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.180\nThere's nothing in it.\n\n72\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.020\nWe just have there.\n\n73\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.557\nWe were anticipating this\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n74\n00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:39.160\nBut, let's go and create a new file,\nand let's called this fighter.js.\n\n75\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.610\nSo I'm gonna do this\nincrementally just to make sure-\n\n76\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, that makes sense.\n\n77\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this works,\nthis still works, this still works.\n\n78\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.470\nThat way, if we rearrange all,\nwe don't have any test or anything.\n\n79\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.380\nOur testing is refresh and\nsee if it breaks.\n\n80\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.570\nIf we do this single manually,\nwe can chase down issues as they crop up.\n\n81\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.990\nIf you do the entire reorganization,\nwhat I'm doing this part,\n\n82\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.820\nthe actual cleaning up.\n\n83\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.240\nAnd then things bring, wait a minute,\nhow is this goes over here and, it can\n\n84\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.480\nbecome a little bit nightmarish if you're\nnot doing this from the very beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.880\nSo let's go ahead and grab that Fighter,\nwhere's the Fighter here?\n\n86\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.430\nThere we go, and here's our Fighter.\n\n87\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.880\nAnd wait for it, I'm I definitely\nwould have normally used a mouse for\n\n88\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.970\nthat or maybe a Vim, but that's alright.\n\n89\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.278\nSo, there's our Fighter class.\n\n90\n00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:32.356\nIt is now in its own file and\nlet's just tab this over.\n\n91\n00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:33.690\nShouldn't have done that.\n\n92\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.976\nThere we go.\n\n93\n00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:38.289\nThat little border there, that gutter\nmakes it look like it's space over,\n\n94\n00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.460\nbut it's in fact not.\n\n95\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.175\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to save.\n\n96\n00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:44.090\nAnd if I was to go over and\nrefresh this, it's immediately broke.\n\n97\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.480\nAnd that is because the Fighter\nclass is not on our index.html page.\n\n98\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.930\nThere we go, so we need to fix that.\n\n99\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.674\nAnd this is what I am talking\nabout doing this incrementally,\n\n100\n00:04:53.674 --> 00:04:55.678\nand probably like Justin\nused to say this in so\n\n101\n00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:56.753\nmany other places-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:58.199\n&gt;&gt; You're kinda humping on it.\n\n103\n00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.150\nBut I am trying to make you life easy.\n\n104\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.780\nRight, I'm trying to help [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; One step at a time, so\n\n105\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.626\nthat we don't make mistake\nwhen we go forward and try it.\n\n106\n00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:10.722\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the biggest hindrance\nof being successful and\n\n107\n00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:14.311\nfeeling like you've accomplished\nsomething is debugging.\n\n108\n00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:18.070\nYou're like, I just moved this\none thing and now it's broke.\n\n109\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.769\nSo, you don't have to follow my advice,\nI strongly recommend it though.\n\n110\n00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.908\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So we don't have to.\n\n111\n00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so there it is.\n\n112\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.840\nSo if I add that back, it's good to go.\n\n113\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now that's good.\n\n114\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.640\nLet's go ahead and create that other one,\nthe Attacker so to speak.\n\n115\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.620\nAnd New File, and that's attacker.js.\n\n116\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.556\nThere we go.\nAnd I'm gonna come over here to the app\n\n117\n00:05:45.556 --> 00:05:50.170\nand grab the attacker class,\nand cut it, and\n\n118\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.300\nput it over here, paste, save.\n\n119\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.972\nSave this one, come over to\nthe index.html, boom, Attacker.\n\n120\n00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:02.940\nNow, here again, just to reiterate.\n\n121\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.870\nIf these were dependent on each other,\nthen the order may matter.\n\n122\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.050\nBut I know a Fighter and\nan Attacker are only used in app.js so\n\n123\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.950\ntheir order are not necessarily coupled.\n\n124\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.120\nSo do keep that in mind.\nIf we come back and we refresh,\n\n125\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.950\neverything is good to go.\n\n126\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.171\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we've done that.\n\n127\n00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.080\nWe got one more class to extract.\n\n128\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.646\nAnd this is just so we can focus when\nwe're in app.js, we can focus on the game.\n\n129\n00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:29.639\nThe game logic only.\n\n130\n00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.406\nNow, we may end up changing\nthat to something even\n\n131\n00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:38.276\nmore kind of straightforward, right?\n\n132\n00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:41.900\nSo I'm gonna create a new Pellet file.\n\n133\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.938\nAnd here's our pellet.js, paste, save,\nsave this, come over to index.html.\n\n134\n00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:52.569\nAnd if you're using a full fledged IDE,\nintegrated development environment,\n\n135\n00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:57.284\nwhich has a lot of tooling along with it,\nor you even have plugins for\n\n136\n00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:02.206\nAdam that you've kind of sourced,\nsometimes this can be automated.\n\n137\n00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:05.606\nYou can say pull out into a class, and\nit'll automate some of those things for\n\n138\n00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:07.027\nyou, but I just do it manually.\n\n139\n00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:11.370\nSo, I tend to be a little bit of\na control freak and high capacity.\n\n140\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.591\nSo there's our re-factor so to speak.\n\n141\n00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:19.460\nAnd well, our clean up, excuse me.\n\n142\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.410\nAnd here is our game now.\n\n143\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.975\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; So we have our addEventListener, and\n\n144\n00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:28.150\nwe have our render and our update\n&gt;&gt; And then, our main function and\n\n145\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.650\nthere they go.\n\n146\n00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.920\nThey have request animation frame.\n\n147\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.595\nWe're all good to go.\n\n148\n00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Justin is that all we have to do?\n\n149\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.745\n&gt;&gt; We could stop there.\n\n150\n00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:39.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've cleaned this up a bit.\n\n151\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.440\nWe could stop there, but I'm thinking.\n\n152\n00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:48.339\nI am thinking that maybe it's probably\nbest to pull these out of the global\n\n153\n00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:49.207\nname space.\n\n154\n00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:56.306\nMaybe decouple these just a touch with\nrespect to what we have on the screen.\n\n155\n00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:02.377\nWhat I mean is I have all of this,\nthis canvas is all that we need.\n\n156\n00:08:02.377 --> 00:08:06.395\nBut you know there, we need this,\nwe need this, we need,\n\n157\n00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:11.483\nif I encapsulate the account pull that\ntogether there is the ability to now\n\n158\n00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:17.110\nmake this dynamic, where I pass that\nin as a selector, what is the screen?\n\n159\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.020\nAnd then, again,\nI could make multiple ones of these games.\n\n160\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.850\nNow the Window Add Event Listener\ngets a little wonky we would have to\n\n161\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.100\nhandle that a little differently if we\nhave a bunch of these on one screen.\n\n162\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.520\nBut that's just something\nyou should be aware of.\n\n163\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.540\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\npull this into a game object.\n\n164\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.530\nAnd initially I'm just gonna\ndo that inside of this.\n\n165\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:43.142\nIn previous times, what I've done, when\nyou've seen me refactor, is sometimes I've\n\n166\n00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:47.446\nused the revealing module pattern, where\nI just create a function called game, or\n\n167\n00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:50.783\nsomething of that nature,\nthat returns the object that I need.\n\n168\n00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:53.080\nThe method, or what not,\nat the very bottom.\n\n169\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.160\nI'm actually going to refactor this\ninto a class to keep some consistency\n\n170\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.330\nwithin this project.\n\n171\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.060\nNow, I'm not guaranteeing that I'll\nalways be able to do that as this project\n\n172\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.080\nprogresses.\n\n173\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.500\nBut some things can blame themselves\nto functions and module pattern.\n\n174\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.310\nBut what that means is I am gonna\nhave to change a little more\n\n175\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.200\nthan I normally would have.\n\n176\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.490\nBut that's okay.\n\n177\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.170\nSo let's create our class here and\nlet's call it AtmoAttack.\n\n178\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.960\n&gt;&gt; I like that name.\n\n179\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.993\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, AtmoAttack.\n\n180\n00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have to say it real\n\n181\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.470\ndramatic like that.\n\n182\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.400\n&gt;&gt; AtmoAttack.\n\n183\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.310\n&gt;&gt; See, just like that.\n\n184\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.460\nYou have it down, Zach.\n\n185\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.753\nI might have to hire you for\nbranding or something.\n\n186\n00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:32.310\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, don't have it,\n\n187\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.230\nso that is totally out of the question.\n\n188\n00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.830\n&gt;&gt; So in our constructor what I'm thinking\nis our constructor can dynamically\n\n189\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.580\ntake a label.\n\n190\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.510\nWhich would select our screen so\nwe get pointed at different screens and\n\n191\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.650\ncreate different ones.\n\n192\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.226\nSo I'm gonna say selector and I'm\nactually gonna store this on the object.\n\n193\n00:09:49.226 --> 00:09:53.510\nSo selector = selector, just like so.\n\n194\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.639\nLikewise I'm gonna grab this and\njust cut this and\n\n195\n00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:06.677\npaste, and\nnow I have to change a few other things,\n\n196\n00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:10.904\nthis.screen and this.context.\n\n197\n00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:16.366\nSo in addition to this is going to change\nhow we call some of these functions.\n\n198\n00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:20.680\nSo by changing this into a class\nthings are getting a little wonky.\n\n199\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.150\nInstead of keeping the screen portion,\n\n200\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.560\nthough, I just want this\nto be a dynamic selector.\n\n201\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.117\nNow, there's a lot more that I can do\nthis, I could say here's the container\n\n202\n00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:30.553\nobject and\ncreate the canvas dynamically and such.\n\n203\n00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:36.089\nBut lets say game = AtmoAttack('.screen');\n\n204\n00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:42.665\nwe should have a voice overall for\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n205\n00:10:42.665 --> 00:10:44.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here's our AtmoAttck and\n\n206\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.780\nthis should be in the global namespace.\n\n207\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.005\nLet's go see what we have here.\n\n208\n00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:50.540\nUh-oh, class constructor,\ncannot be invoked without new.\n\n209\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.610\nAnd I totally forgot that I need the new\nkeywords in between functions and\n\n210\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.560\nclasses, you have to create a new object,\nthere we go.\n\n211\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.070\nSelector's not defined, let's see here,\n\n212\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.100\nthat's because I misspelled\nit in the constructor.\n\n213\n00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.712\nSome of you probably saw that and\nit was like hey, you got a typo there.\n\n214\n00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:12.103\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna wreck your day.\n\n215\n00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:13.420\nScreen get context.\n\n216\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.590\nNow why did that occur, that's because\nit's this.screen instead of just screen.\n\n217\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.310\nSo, these are the things where I'm doing\nthis little chunks because I know I'm\n\n218\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.390\ngoing to have to chase some of these down\nbecause I didn't have to put this in\n\n219\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.810\na class, I wanted to maintain\nconsistency so you could follow along.\n\n220\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.070\nAlso, I wanted to reinforce the fact\nthere's like 10 different ways to do\n\n221\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.090\nany one thing.\n\n222\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.900\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n223\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.790\nAnd I refresh.\n\n224\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.650\nContext is not defined.\n\n225\n00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.240\nNow things are broken.\n\n226\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.490\nThat's because I'm calling\nthis main method down here.\n\n227\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.520\nLet me take that off so\nwe can take a look.\n\n228\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.330\nRefresh, and\nlet's look at the game object.\n\n229\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.060\nThere's the game.\n\n230\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.400\nAnd what do we have?\n\n231\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.920\nWe have the selector,\nwhich is the selector for the screen.\n\n232\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.040\nAnd then we have the screen object, and\nthen we have the rendering content.\n\n233\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.480\nSo, we have that part down.\n\n234\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.245\nBut now, in order to get things running,\n\n235\n00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:09.930\nI'm kind of just going\nto pull this inside.\n\n236\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.210\nI could build the fighter,\nthe attacker outside of the game and\n\n237\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.220\npass those in as dependencies.\n\n238\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.370\nBut just to keep things simple, what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna grab this part and\n\n239\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.090\nI'm gonna pull those inside as well.\n\n240\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:30.810\nAnd I'm gonna make this this dot and\nthis dot, just like that.\n\n241\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.690\nOkay.\n\n242\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.890\nSo let's go find out.\n\n243\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.910\nDid we have what we anticipated?\n\n244\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.372\nThere we go we have our fighter,\nour attacker and everything is kind\n\n245\n00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:45.490\nof bundled into this game object,\nso I can move this around now.\n\n246\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.655\nAnd the finally let's add\nthese pellets as such.\n\n247\n00:12:49.655 --> 00:12:54.580\nSo, paste nope.\n\n248\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.370\nApparently I accidentally\ndeleted that from my clipboard.\n\n249\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.248\nBut luckily it was\npretty easy to maintain.\n\n250\n00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:05.880\nAnd I think this has all of our,\n\n251\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.590\nnotice our constructors\nare initialization of information.\n\n252\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.070\nThat's where it should be.\n\n253\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.400\nThere's one final thing that\nwe should probably should do.\n\n254\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.074\nBut before I do, you can't see him,\n\n255\n00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:19.898\nit looks like Zach is off camera\njust itching with a question.\n\n256\n00:13:19.898 --> 00:13:21.001\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm itching.\n\n257\n00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:24.910\n[LAUGH] Anyway, what I'm wondering is\nthere any ramifications from changing\n\n258\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.840\nfrom const to this dot?\n\n259\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.530\nIs there any ramifications\nany bugs that have\n\n260\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not bugs other than we're losing\n\n261\n00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.370\nthat constant binding.\n\n262\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.410\nThat immutable binding\nto fighter to attacker.\n\n263\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.830\nAnd what they could cause is if you're\nnot careful you may accidentally\n\n264\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.140\nreassign the fighter to a new file or\nto not a fighter,\n\n265\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.580\nand then your app breaks,\nyour game breaks.\n\n266\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.530\nNow, that's kind of power for\nthe course in JavaScript, so\n\n267\n00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.140\nwe always gonna leave at B.\n\n268\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.500\nI will tell you this though, based on\nsome things, like resetting the game,\n\n269\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.157\nstarting the game,\n\n270\n00:13:57.157 --> 00:14:01.850\nyou probably are going to have to remove\nthat cost binding anyway, in this context.\n\n271\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.120\nSo we'll just act like nothing happened.\n\n272\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.030\nBut you do need to be careful,\nbecause now someone could come here and\n\n273\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:13.686\nsay game.Fighter = null, just like that.\n\n274\n00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:18.535\nAnd now game.Fighter is null,\nand we look at game, well,\n\n275\n00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:23.060\nnull would have none of the methods\nassociated with the fighter.\n\n276\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.720\nAnd if you're relying on\nthat being a fighter type,\n\n277\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.990\na fighter object, your game breaks.\n\n278\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.720\nNow, using the revealing module pattern,\nwhat I mean, is keep everything the same.\n\n279\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.500\nJust have the function return the object.\n\n280\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.540\nYou could actually keep\nthose cost bindings and\n\n281\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.500\nto some extent hide that information\naway from your public interface.\n\n282\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.490\nThat is one of the pluses.\n\n283\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.760\nHowever, if you wanted to reset the game,\nyou could possibly reset the fighter,\n\n284\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.490\nmutate the fighter, or\n\n285\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.860\nyou could just construct a new fighter and\nthen reassign it.\n\n286\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.788\nSo, I tend just to construct a new object\nlet garbage collection take care of\n\n287\n00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:00.099\nthe other objects.\n\n288\n00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.430\nSo we're gonna remove\nthat cost binding anyway.\n\n289\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.890\nBut it is not hidden, it is publicly\navailable on the object type which for\n\n290\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.270\nus as we're building,\nit's actually pretty good.\n\n291\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.924\nCuz now I can just inspect in the console\nand see how things are working.\n\n292\n00:15:12.924 --> 00:15:14.206\nOr whether they're available.\n\n293\n00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:21.380\nSo, this constructor portion-that's\nnice and, you know, there's\n\n294\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.310\nsome hemming and hawing about\nwhether one should do this or not.\n\n295\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.884\nReally, all of your assignment of\ninformation should be in the constructor\n\n296\n00:15:33.884 --> 00:15:34.602\nfunction.\n\n297\n00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:40.711\nBut right here at the very bottom\nI'm gonna call addEventListeners,\n\n298\n00:15:40.711 --> 00:15:43.630\nor you know what, setupEvents.\n\n299\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.418\nLet's be a little less\nlike the actual method.\n\n300\n00:15:47.418 --> 00:15:53.349\nWhat we're gonna do is setup the event\nlisteners in a separate thing,\n\n301\n00:15:53.349 --> 00:15:58.274\nand what that could entail is\nactually listening to Either\n\n302\n00:15:58.274 --> 00:16:01.404\nsomething like the screen, right?\n\n303\n00:16:01.404 --> 00:16:06.120\nLike so, or it could add new\ndata inside of this method.\n\n304\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.680\nGenerally, it's probably not a good\nidea to do something like this.\n\n305\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.735\nLet me just show you what I'm talking\nabout instead of speaking in generalities.\n\n306\n00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:23.110\nSo if I say this.carrot = 1,\nI've now set a new property on the object.\n\n307\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.830\nThat's okay, but do keep in mind,\nyou have to be careful about this,\n\n308\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.440\ncuz this can also overwrite properties\nthat are already on the object.\n\n309\n00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.220\nFor instance, if I said, this.fighter\n= null inside of setUpEvents, it would\n\n310\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.260\nbe null after this function ran which\nis at the very end of the constructor.\n\n311\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.770\nSo just be careful there.\n\n312\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.030\nThere are certain times where you should,\ncertain times where you shouldn't,\n\n313\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.630\nit's all a matter of being careful,\nbeing aware and, well,\n\n314\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.630\nfollowing an appropriate cautiousness,\nI suppose.\n\n315\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.900\nNow what is the setup events?\n\n316\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.720\nI think, and this is just for ease of use.\n\n317\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.752\nI'm gonna pull this into here, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:08.752 --> 00:17:13.010\nNow this portion,\n\n319\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.383\njust like inside of here, is going to\nhave the appropriate this context.\n\n320\n00:17:17.383 --> 00:17:22.625\nSo notice this e fat arrow,\nwe can definitely get away\n\n321\n00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:29.153\nwith adding a this.fighter,\nthis.fighter, this.pellets,\n\n322\n00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:34.410\nthis.fighter, let me just\nhighlight all of those.\n\n323\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.338\nThis.fighter, like so,\nand then this.pellets,\n\n324\n00:17:40.338 --> 00:17:46.640\nI have to add a this there because\nthey're now the final AtmoAttack object.\n\n325\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.860\nWe come back and\nwe refresh and we look at game,\n\n326\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.780\nwell it looks like it's good,\nwe can't see anything until it renders.\n\n327\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.529\nSo we're gonna leave it there but I'll\ntell you a little hint, foreshadowing so\n\n328\n00:17:58.529 --> 00:17:59.033\nto speak.\n\n329\n00:17:59.033 --> 00:18:03.726\nWe're gonna have to come back to that cuz\nthat's a weird, anonymous function inside\n\n330\n00:18:03.726 --> 00:18:06.997\nof the addEventListener at\nthe Window addEventListener.\n\n331\n00:18:06.997 --> 00:18:11.457\nThat's okay maybe for here, but if we had\nother events that we had to register, and\n\n332\n00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:15.789\nwe wanted them all to be here, now I have\nto scroll through and figure out, okay,\n\n333\n00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:19.259\nat the end of this function,\nI have another addEventListener.\n\n334\n00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:21.210\nIt's a little messy,\nmaybe we should clean it up.\n\n335\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.430\nWe'll get there.\n\n336\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.950\nBut only after we render\nbecause I know it,\n\n337\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.850\nthere's some shenanigans\ngonna happen here.\n\n338\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Not shenanigans.\n\n339\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:33.812\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans, so now what I'm gonna\ndo is grab this render portion.\n\n340\n00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:37.470\nI'm gonna bring it up and\nif you look, that's the end.\n\n341\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.194\nI'm gonna paste.\n\n342\n00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:39.201\nAnd you're like, well, Justin.\n\n343\n00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.330\nThat is not the appropriate\nmethod definition.\n\n344\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.548\nYou're right, but\nif I remove the const and\n\n345\n00:18:45.548 --> 00:18:49.310\nI remove this, and I also remove that.\n\n346\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.190\nNow I have an appropriate\nmethod definition.\n\n347\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:58.840\nHowever, this would not work\nbecause I need to add this.,\n\n348\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.373\nbecause it is this instance of the game.\n\n349\n00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:08.205\nSo here's this., and this.fighter, and\n\n350\n00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:11.011\nif(this.attacker).\n\n351\n00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:15.050\nAnd this.attacker.render, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.270\nAnd then the context, this is the one\nthat'll trip people up, this.context,\n\n353\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.825\nbecause it's now part of the game object.\n\n354\n00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:24.720\nSo, this., and this.context, here.\n\n355\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.440\nOkay, so the question is,\nif we call game.render, like so.\n\n356\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.230\nWe're manually calling that,\nit's only gonna happen one time.\n\n357\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.940\nWe render, why is it not rendering?\n\n358\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.330\nWe should probably figure that out.\n\n359\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.656\nWell there's no pellets,\nthere is a fighter though.\n\n360\n00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:48.619\nSo let's see game.render, this.context,\n\n361\n00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:54.275\nthis.screen.context, that's good and\neverything's setup.\n\n362\n00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:59.383\nLet's try to call it manually here,\ngame.render,\n\n363\n00:19:59.383 --> 00:20:04.158\nand let's look at game and\nthere's our fighter.\n\n364\n00:20:04.158 --> 00:20:07.944\nAnd why is that not being dropped?\n\n365\n00:20:07.944 --> 00:20:09.655\nWell, Zach,\nyou wanted some live action debugging.\n\n366\n00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:11.962\nI think we're gonna go with it right here.\n\n367\n00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:14.582\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking this was a magic\neye painting I was looking at.\n\n368\n00:20:14.582 --> 00:20:17.368\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, it is unfortunately not.\n\n369\n00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:18.923\nAnd, let's see here.\n\n370\n00:20:18.923 --> 00:20:23.011\nThis.render, so\nthis.fighter.render,this.context, so\n\n371\n00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:25.421\nthis.fighter, that should be fine.\n\n372\n00:20:25.421 --> 00:20:29.940\nAha, here it is and\nit was actually in a previous method.\n\n373\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.100\nI think this is it, it's this.screen,\nthis.screen because they don't,\n\n374\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.409\nthey have null is undefined divided by 2,\nwhich is not a number.\n\n375\n00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:42.310\nIt don't have a valid coordinates for\nthe attacker and for the fighter.\n\n376\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.710\nAnd as result, it would never\nrender appropriately on the screen.\n\n377\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.590\nSo if I come back, boom there it is.\n\n378\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.305\n&gt;&gt; Thank goodness.\n\n379\n00:20:48.305 --> 00:20:50.324\n[APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; Aha,\n\n380\n00:20:50.324 --> 00:20:53.902\nI feel pretty proud of myself because\nI caught that in record time.\n\n381\n00:20:53.902 --> 00:20:59.539\nThose are really hard to track\ndown sometimes because we\n\n382\n00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:04.705\ndidn't really see that interestingly\nenough, inside the game object,\n\n383\n00:21:04.705 --> 00:21:12.010\nit gave weird results, right?\n\n384\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.950\nSo, actually I'm gonna remove this dot and\n\n385\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.300\nsee if we can reproduce to show\nyou what I'm talking about.\n\n386\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:24.290\nSo refresh and I look at game, and\nI come in here and look at the fighter and\n\n387\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:30.750\nscreen 960 width, why is it doing that?\n\n388\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.040\nWell, you have to be careful\nbecause the keyword screen,\n\n389\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.560\nlowercase, actually returns\nthe screen object, so I misspoke.\n\n390\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.371\nIt is returning a different\nscreen variable which,\n\n391\n00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:49.170\nin the grand scheme of things, is probably\nbetter that we took this out of the global\n\n392\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.313\nname space cuz that was\ngetting overwritten.\n\n393\n00:21:51.313 --> 00:21:54.326\nI was pretty sure this should\nhave been capital screen but\n\n394\n00:21:54.326 --> 00:21:56.750\nthat's actually the constructor.\n\n395\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:01.240\nIf we look at screen, it gives me\nthe screen size, the x and y and\n\n396\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.295\nwidth and height, excuse me, the width and\nheight and various other parameters.\n\n397\n00:22:05.295 --> 00:22:07.558\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So notice width and height.\n\n398\n00:22:07.558 --> 00:22:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then I divide those by 2 and\n\n399\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.790\nthey gave me valid numbers which actually\nputs my fighter way out of focus, so\n\n400\n00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.370\nto speak, or out of the view port.\n\n401\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.010\nSo, be very careful there.\n\n402\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.820\nThat makes me think totally forgot about\nthe screen variable being there with\n\n403\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.010\nthe name space.\n\n404\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.000\nSo I'm glad we are doing this.\n\n405\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.700\nSo now I have this render, that works,\nand what about this update?\n\n406\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.120\nWell we're gonna kind of par for\nthe course so to speak.\n\n407\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.640\nAnd come back up here and\n\n408\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.990\nI'm gonna remove that semicolon\ncuz I don't need it necessarily.\n\n409\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.111\nAnd remove this const,\nremove this equal sign,\n\n410\n00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:52.333\nremove this fat arrow,\nand then this.pellets,\n\n411\n00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:57.504\nthis.attacker, and\npellet.hits(this.attacker).\n\n412\n00:22:57.504 --> 00:23:00.565\nAnd this.attacker =.\n\n413\n00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:03.910\nAnd then this.pellets.splice.\n\n414\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.390\nIf pellet, and then this.pellets,\nthis.attacker.\n\n415\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.251\nActually, I guess we should just\nselect all the attackers and\n\n416\n00:23:13.251 --> 00:23:15.318\nsay this., there we go.\n\n417\n00:23:15.318 --> 00:23:19.245\nAnd then this.screen cuz\nthat would mess up things.\n\n418\n00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:22.614\nAnd this.pellets, just like so.\n\n419\n00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:24.420\nSo that's a lot of this dots.\n\n420\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.683\nBut it should work now.\n\n421\n00:23:26.683 --> 00:23:32.283\nNow, we're gonna handle this by\ngoing game.update, right, and\n\n422\n00:23:32.283 --> 00:23:37.505\nthen just duplicating that a few times and\nthen game.render.\n\n423\n00:23:37.505 --> 00:23:41.095\nJust to hand test this before we unleash\nit with request animation frame.\n\n424\n00:23:41.095 --> 00:23:42.416\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So to speak.\n\n425\n00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:46.971\nSo, you'll notice if we say,\n\n426\n00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:51.877\nlet's just do a bunch of these cuz\n\n427\n00:23:51.877 --> 00:23:56.974\nwe know we should be in the middle.\n\n428\n00:23:56.974 --> 00:23:59.007\nIf we refresh, notice it's actually moved.\n\n429\n00:23:59.007 --> 00:24:02.670\nSo the update is working, there is\nno error thrown, a three rendering.\n\n430\n00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.640\nThat's good to know.\n\n431\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.180\nBut now let's just go ahead and\nremove all of that.\n\n432\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.608\nSo something that you try to reason about,\nwhat is this doing?\n\n433\n00:24:14.608 --> 00:24:16.950\nAll right, so request animation frame.\n\n434\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.535\nAll right, so if we come back here.\n\n435\n00:24:18.535 --> 00:24:22.580\nAnd we add a main, and\n\n436\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.975\nI may even call this run, something\nof that nature as a method on this.\n\n437\n00:24:27.975 --> 00:24:34.720\nSo let's pull this back, remove this,\nand it should be this dot update,\n\n438\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.750\nand this dot render, because it's\nthis game it objects animation.\n\n439\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.456\nAnd the order to find is,\nthis is gonna break.\n\n440\n00:24:42.456 --> 00:24:44.970\nSo if I refresh, and it's broke.\n\n441\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.100\n&gt;&gt; You broke it.\n\n442\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.660\n&gt;&gt; And well, it's not really broke.\n\n443\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.680\nI've gotta call a game.main.\n\n444\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this actually is broke.\n\n445\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.330\nWhy is that?\n\n446\n00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.760\nWell, if we come over\nhere we forgot this.main,\n\n447\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.410\nbecause we wanna call this\nobject's main method.\n\n448\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.490\nRefresh and\ncannot read property main of undefined.\n\n449\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.090\nWell, that's just handy.\n\n450\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.720\nWhy is that?\n\n451\n00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.332\nCuz the next time that it gets cue\ndown by request animation frame,\n\n452\n00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:20.530\nthat this context changes not to a game\nobject but to the Window object.\n\n453\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.640\nSo how do we that?\n\n454\n00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.910\nWell, there's a couple of ways.\n\n455\n00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.100\nWe are going to say .bind(this).\n\n456\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.320\nSo I wanna bind to this context that\ncurrently is a more common thing\n\n457\n00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:35.468\nthat I tend to use is\nsay something like this.\n\n458\n00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:39.950\nSo an anonymous function that\nmaintains that this context that we\n\n459\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.300\nare anticipating.\n\n460\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:47.070\nSo now if this function runs because it's\na [INAUDIBLE], uses the same disk scope.\n\n461\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.040\nSo this.main would be this main method,\nand there we go, it's back to normal.\n\n462\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.140\nSo, either way it is doable.\n\n463\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.070\nMoreover, if I'm not mistaken\nthere's a way that you can bind\n\n464\n00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.570\nthe this context a little bit differently\nby a different method definition.\n\n465\n00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.270\nBut now, we have this game object.\n\n466\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.550\nIt all works.\n\n467\n00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.590\nThere's one final change that\nI wanna make to it though.\n\n468\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.820\nThis window.addEventListener,\n\n469\n00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.740\nwe're kinda gonna encounter something\nlike we did the request animation frame.\n\n470\n00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.140\nI want to, maybe, handle keyboard events.\n\n471\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.890\nAnd this could be argued to\nbeing a different object, and\n\n472\n00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:31.105\nhave different methods, but,\nlet's just say handleKeyboardInput.\n\n473\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.580\nLike so.\n\n474\n00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.600\nAnd that takes an event object,\nbecause, well, we need it.\n\n475\n00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.800\nAnd I'm going to grab all of this code,\nright here.\n\n476\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:52.650\nAnd cut it and I'm gonna paste\nit right there just like so.\n\n477\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.330\nAnd as a result you are like well,\n\n478\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:02.690\nI can say this.HandleKeybaordInput and\nit should work.\n\n479\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.586\nLet's go back and guess what?\n\n480\n00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:08.603\nCan I [INAUDIBLE].\n\n481\n00:27:08.603 --> 00:27:10.400\nAnd we have the exact same thing.\n\n482\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.260\nWe have a weird this binding.\n\n483\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.100\nBecause in an event listener, it is bound\nto the event target that this keyword is.\n\n484\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.110\nSo we can do a very similar thing\nthat we did just a moment ago and\n\n485\n00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:25.200\nlet's use the [INAUDIBLE] function\nto kind of get around that.\n\n486\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.680\nNow I could do bind this, and\n\n487\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.750\nthat way we can change to this\ncontext in the event handler.\n\n488\n00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.580\nBut now, we can still shoot,\nwe can still move.\n\n489\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.290\nWe're all good to go.\n\n490\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.421\nAnd then setupEvents or\nwindow.addEventListener keydown.\n\n491\n00:27:43.421 --> 00:27:47.890\nWell, this is very easy to reason about.\n\n492\n00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:48.410\nwhat does it do?\n\n493\n00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.540\nIt handles key board input.\n\n494\n00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.890\nNow if that's the one I wanna know about,\nI just go read that method and\n\n495\n00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.580\nI will have to go through and\ngo what is set up events doing?\n\n496\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.730\nIt's very simplistic.\n\n497\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.020\nI like to keep mine simplistic and then\nput my other events, either another object\n\n498\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.570\nthat's handling those or\ninternally if it's just one like this.\n\n499\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.090\nSo there's our refactor.\n\n500\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.500\nWe're good to go.\n\n501\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.050\nAnd I'm gonna leave the game here for now\nbecause this is probably where most of our\n\n502\n00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.158\nwork is gonna be in addition\nto changing some things out.\n\n503\n00:28:17.158 --> 00:28:21.400\nSo I [instantiate the game and\nI call game.main everything is good to go.\n\n504\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.110\nWe're gonna leave that there but\n\n505\n00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.730\nultimately if I have some external\nlogic before the game is set up or\n\n506\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.570\nI wanna change how, I'll probably\nremove that into another file.\n\n507\n00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.900\nI'll move that into another file.\n\n508\n00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.098\nWell, but things are clinging\nup on our refectory at least for\n\n509\n00:28:34.098 --> 00:28:37.865\nnow who knows there may be things on\nthe horizon that we need to do as well.\n\n510\n00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:41.957\nBut I think this is a good start to see,\nhere we go,\n\n511\n00:28:41.957 --> 00:28:45.360\nthis is all of our logic that we need.\n\n512\n00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.110\nAnd now we can move forward\nwith additional features.\n\n513\n00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.998\n&gt;&gt; And you know we will move forward.\n\n514\n00:28:49.998 --> 00:28:51.949\nCleaning up and refactoring.\n\n515\n00:28:51.949 --> 00:28:52.911\nGreat episode Justin.\n\n516\n00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:54.088\nMarvelous job as usual and\n\n517\n00:28:54.088 --> 00:28:57.350\nbefore we move forward I know you have\nsomething else you'd like to say.\n\n518\n00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:02.375\n&gt;&gt; Well, during this cleaning up phase and\nreorganizing, I noticed we've still\n\n519\n00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:07.100\nhave one attacker, we had multiple\npellets, we still have one attacker.\n\n520\n00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.930\nWe should probably fix that, I mean\nwe've got things that shoot stuff and\n\n521\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.220\nall the attacker does is move.\n\n522\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.090\nBut really, to really even the odds,\n\n523\n00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.660\nI think we should probably\nhave multiple attackers.\n\n524\n00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n525\n00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.010\n&gt;&gt; Just to make the game a little more\ninteresting, so, definitely stay tuned,\n\n526\n00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.590\nwe're coming back with that.\n\n527\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Jess, and make sure\nyou watch every single one of the episodes\n\n528\n00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.540\nof HTML 5 Canvas Projects, and you know,\ngo to our

go.\n\n3\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:20.650\nI'm your host Zack Memmis, and\nyou're watching HTML 5 canvas projects,\n\n4\n00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.020\nwe are gonna be creating a swarm.\n\n5\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.160\nAnd we have an IT DEVPro expert\nwho can tell us how to do that and\n\n6\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380\nhis name is Justin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.850\nJustin, good to see you again, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.127\n&gt;&gt; It's good to see you as well but\nI am kind of taking it back,\n\n9\n00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:34.118\nI though you were the DEVPro IT expert\nthat was going to show us how to do this.\n\n10\n00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:35.526\n&gt;&gt; I can show you how to make pancakes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:37.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really good ones.\n\n12\n00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How are you doing today, Zach?\n\n13\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing very well,\nthank you very much.\n\n14\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000\nAnd I'm very excited that\nwe're moving forward with our,\n\n15\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.940\nI call this actually our\nhomage to the alien attacker.\n\n16\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.303\nOr as you call it, Atmo attack.\n\n17\n00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:53.735\nAnd last time we left off,\nyou had just reconfigured some things,\n\n18\n00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:57.004\ndid some cleaning up, refactoring,\nso what's going on now?\n\n19\n00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.589\n&gt;&gt; So in the last episode,\n\n20\n00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.125\nwe gotta give the Atmo attackers\na little fighting chance, right?\n\n21\n00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:07.761\nThere's currently one of them, we've\ngot two bullets, or pellets, excuse me.\n\n22\n00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.159\nWe're not condoning violence necessarily.\n\n23\n00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.042\n&gt;&gt; No, metaphorical.\n&gt;&gt; This is a game.\n\n24\n00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.737\nWe need to give them a fighting chance.\n\n25\n00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:14.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right so,\n\n26\n00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:20.515\nreally it's probably likely if there was\ngonna be some kind of invasion, right.\n\n27\n00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:24.320\nThere's gonna be more one of them,\nso like a swamp of them, men.\n\n28\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.270\nTo some extent, I don't know if you've\never been part of a locust swarm,\n\n29\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.471\nwhen the cicadas and\nthe various loci type things locuses.\n\n30\n00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.315\n&gt;&gt; Locusts, locusts.\n\n31\n00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:39.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of rain freak,\nman, it can get a little die.\n\n32\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.543\n&gt;&gt; I'm from Iowa, we had a grasshopper\nswarm once and it was unbelievable.\n\n33\n00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:46.408\n&gt;&gt; But there's a lot of them and\n\n34\n00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:50.170\nI think we should be able to\nreproduce them in our game.\n\n35\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.565\nSo right now we have a single attacker,\nwe need multiple attackers.\n\n36\n00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.222\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:56.222 --> 00:02:00.070\nget that started and\nsee how we're going to work on this.\n\n38\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.380\nLet's take a look at the code here,\nand just peruse.\n\n39\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.470\nWhere are we using this attack?\n\n40\n00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.560\nHere's our attacker.\n\n41\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.712\nThere's a single attacker,\nthere's a single attacker, and\n\n42\n00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.201\nthere's a single attacker.\n\n43\n00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.398\nWe already have this\ncollection of pellets.\n\n44\n00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:14.650\n&gt;&gt; So I have a question on that one.\n\n45\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.235\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n46\n00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.444\n&gt;&gt; So if we're doing the multiple\nattackers, is that gonna be similar to how\n\n47\n00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:20.900\nwe created the pellets, or\nis it going to be different?\n\n48\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.366\n&gt;&gt; We're actually going to do something\nsimilar to how we worked with pellets, but\n\n49\n00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:28.992\nwe may find that it reads a little\nbetter if we then abstract that.\n\n50\n00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:30.472\nBut we're going to work on that road,\n\n51\n00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:33.080\nbecause we know the pellet's kind\nof architecture work, right.\n\n52\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890\nAn array, and we just did right through,\nand everything's good.\n\n53\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.350\nBut we may find that,\nthat doesn't quite work out.\n\n54\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.670\nOr at least for readability,\nwe may change it up.\n\n55\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.720\nLet's just get it working.\n\n56\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.440\nI'm a big component of\njust getting it working.\n\n57\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.970\nSo there's our attacker, but really\nthis should be a bunch of attackers,\n\n58\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.290\nand how do we make a great\ndeal of attackers?\n\n59\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.902\nLet's see here, attackers.\n\n60\n00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:58.533\nOr we could do that and that's it [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n62\n00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.954\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n63\n00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:02.637\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no,no.\n\n64\n00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:05.339\n&gt;&gt; Bye you all.\n\n65\n00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.879\n&gt;&gt; We'd probably need a function that\nmight help us out building this, right?\n\n66\n00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We kind of space them out.\n\n67\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.090\nCuz what I'm thinking is,\nwe can't have them equally spaced based on\n\n68\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.270\na starting position and\nthen we just space them out.\n\n69\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.700\nNow this is gonna take\na little bit of tweaking,\n\n70\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.360\nwe'll just get it working before\nwe worry too much about it.\n\n71\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.290\nWhat I'm thinking is a row, a single row\nof attackers that are just there, right?\n\n72\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.170\nSingle one, and\nwe need to space those out.\n\n73\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.620\nSo I'm thinking like create a swarm,\njust like that.\n\n74\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.535\nSo how many attackers do we want?\n\n75\n00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:46.248\nWell, look,\nI'm using this createSwarm function, and\n\n76\n00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:50.130\nI'm just gonna come above and\nsay createSwarm just like so.\n\n77\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.895\nAnd let's think about, what do we need\nto know in order to create a swarm?\n\n78\n00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.679\nWhile probably a starting position for\n\n79\n00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.650\nthe swarm, right,\nwhat is the starting, kind of box?\n\n80\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.901\nSo if we have a bunch of swarm,\nwhere are they localized to?\n\n81\n00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:14.680\nIn addition to how many are in there,\nI think we'll get it.\n\n82\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.077\nBecause there are some other\nthings that we need to consider.\n\n83\n00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:21.450\nBut where's the starting point,\nso that'd be an x and a y?\n\n84\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.807\nAnd I guess I'm searching for\nsomething on my computer, and\n\n85\n00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.745\nthen the number of attackers,\njust like that, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:33.790\nSo we're going to start with this create\nswarm, and how am I going to do that?\n\n87\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.350\nWell, let's see, attackers = [], and\nI can actually use a cost binding here.\n\n88\n00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.141\nAnd I'm gonna say for(let i =,\nthis is kinda old school procedural,\n\n89\n00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.339\nprobably the easiest to do initially.\n\n90\n00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:55.840\nSo (let i = 0; i &lt; numberOfAttacker,\n\n91\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.089\ni += 1), so just a for loop.\n\n92\n00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:03.118\nI'm gonna say attackers.push and\nbreak this apart.\n\n93\n00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:09.450\nAnd I'm gonna for each iteration of that\nI'm gonna create a new attacker, like so.\n\n94\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.050\nWell, what is an attacker need?\n\n95\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.213\nWell, if you come over and look,\nthe attacker needs to know the x and\n\n96\n00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:18.836\nthe y coordinate, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:24.840\nWell the first time through, and\nnotice the width in the high null again.\n\n98\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.120\nWe'll hard-code these values for now,\nand we always have to load them up but\n\n99\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.410\neventually I'll probably pull those\nout into constants or something.\n\n100\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.556\nI think we should probably say x and\ny and let's just see what that does.\n\n101\n00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:40.491\nOkay, so we're gonna create our game,\nwe're gonna come down here,\n\n102\n00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:43.730\nwe're gonna stop our game just so\nwe don't have things breaking.\n\n103\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.870\nAnd let's go look at\nthe attacker swarm now.\n\n104\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.810\nUnexpected token, man,\nthat is not what I wanted to hear.\n\n105\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.496\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Unexpected token, there's that and\n\n106\n00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:58.817\ncreateSwarm and I guess I should\ngive it another x and a y.\n\n107\n00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.295\nSo let's say 100, 100 and\nthen how many of them?\n\n108\n00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.905\nFive to refresh and expect the token here.\n\n109\n00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:08.330\nSo there we go.\n\n110\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.354\nI forgot a semicolon in\nthere instead of the comma.\n\n111\n00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:14.690\nThat was on me.\n\n112\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.680\nI'll take blame for that one.\n\n113\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.750\nSo refresh, there we go.\n\n114\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.715\nAnd if we look at our game,\nlet's look, here's attackers.\n\n115\n00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:26.070\nAttackers, why does it say undefined?\n\n116\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.406\nBecause we forgot to return\nthe attackers from the actual function.\n\n117\n00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:34.723\nNow I could have done this in\nplace inside the constructor but,\n\n118\n00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:37.288\nwhenever you have complex logic or\na lot of loop,\n\n119\n00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:41.770\npull that out into a function that\nreturns what you're expecting.\n\n120\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.890\nNot always the case that you can do that.\n\n121\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.410\nBut here we're constructing an object,\n\n122\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.380\nan array in particular with the number\nof attackers or putting it in there.\n\n123\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.170\nSo now we have this refresh, and\nlet's look at the game again.\n\n124\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.420\nAnd here we go,\nhere are our five attackers.\n\n125\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.359\nNow if I were to render these,\nthey would all be at 100,\n\n126\n00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:03.394\n100 with the same exact width and height.\n\n127\n00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:09.324\nThat's just gonna make them look like\nthere's one of them [LAUGH], right,\n\n128\n00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:11.870\nthey're gonna be stacked\non top of each other.\n\n129\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.510\nSo what we wanna do is space\nthem out horizontally, and\n\n130\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.640\nwe're going to do that by moving\nthe next one by some amount.\n\n131\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.610\nNow it has to be at least 30 and\nprobably a little bit more, right?\n\n132\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.820\nSo add 50 to the horizontal\ndirection each side.\n\n133\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.720\nSo that'll push us,\nwell, let me just show.\n\n134\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.740\nWe should get one here, and then here,\nand then here kinda spaced out along.\n\n135\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.800\nNow we'll have to be careful in this\ncontext, cuz if we have too many\n\n136\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.360\nattackers, what'll happen is it'll\nbe beyond the scope of the screen.\n\n137\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.218\nSo we have to be careful there,\nbut how do I do that?\n\n138\n00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:49.822\nWell, I have a variable\ncalled I that's a number.\n\n139\n00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:54.876\nI'm gonna say + 50, which is\nthe number of pixels the spacing right?\n\n140\n00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:56.070\nSo 30 is the minimum,\n\n141\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.366\nthat's gonna be an additional 20\nbefore I draw on the next one.\n\n142\n00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:02.311\nSo let's go back, let's look, and\n\n143\n00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:08.385\nhere's game.attackers, Like that.\n\n144\n00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:12.093\nSo now we have 100, 152, 253, right?\n\n145\n00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:16.950\nAnd I know this is more than 3, even\nwith the additional 30 pixels that we'll\n\n146\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.430\nhave in width, so we should be good to go.\n\n147\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.127\nThat's our first attempt at a swarm,\nthat's more than one.\n\n148\n00:08:24.127 --> 00:08:25.064\nI'm gonna leave it there.\n\n149\n00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:26.779\nLet's try to get this actually working.\n\n150\n00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:31.142\nSo if we come back through here,\nwhere do we see attacker, or\n\n151\n00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:33.976\nwe gotta this render portion, right?\n\n152\n00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:38.531\nSo let's kinda just comment this out,\nso we can use it as reference.\n\n153\n00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:42.772\nAnd say, this.attackers.forEach\n\n154\n00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:47.548\nbecause this is now a collection, right?\n\n155\n00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:52.765\nAn array in particular, and\nforEach of the those attackers,\n\n156\n00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:57.697\nwe're gonna say\nattacker.render(this.context).\n\n157\n00:08:57.697 --> 00:09:00.424\nWe'll see if I can get that to render out.\n\n158\n00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:02.659\nWell you actually have to cut\nthe game back on, Justin.\n\n159\n00:09:04.032 --> 00:09:06.799\nSo there we go,\nlet's see if we get any craziness.\n\n160\n00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:10.880\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we got our five, right?\n\n161\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.290\nOkay, we could probably fit some more\nin there, but we'll leave that there.\n\n162\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.135\nWe started our swarm-\n&gt;&gt; Baby steps, baby steps.\n\n163\n00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:21.373\n&gt;&gt; Baby steps, yeah, so\nour render works, okay.\n\n164\n00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:24.366\nSo now that our render works,\nI'm actually gonna take this out and\n\n165\n00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:26.679\njust say, all right,\nwell let's go trough this.\n\n166\n00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.869\nWe're gonna clearRect for every pellet,\nwe're gonna render every pellet.\n\n167\n00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:33.490\nAnd for every file we're gonna render that\nfighter, because we only have one, right?\n\n168\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.117\nWhen I have multiple players yet\nor we may not at all.\n\n169\n00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:40.407\nThis tends to be a very good,\nI think once you have multiple players,\n\n170\n00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:42.753\nthis gets a little unruly\non the player's side.\n\n171\n00:09:42.753 --> 00:09:45.916\nAnd then for every attacker,\nrender that attacker, so\n\n172\n00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.753\nthis is a forward loop,\na bunch of forward loops.\n\n173\n00:09:48.753 --> 00:09:51.385\nAnd I use forEach, so I don't get overrun.\n\n174\n00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:52.610\nWe're good to go.\n\n175\n00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:58.144\nOkay, now here comes the rough part.\n\n176\n00:09:58.144 --> 00:10:03.298\nAdhering our update,\nour attacker needs to move, right?\n\n177\n00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:09.357\nSo let's do that part first,\nbefore we worry anything above this.\n\n178\n00:10:09.357 --> 00:10:16.961\nAnd so this we're gonna comment\nthis out just like that.\n\n179\n00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:22.166\nThis.attackers.forEach, now I'm not\nsaying this is the optimal solution.\n\n180\n00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.572\nI'm taking what we had for\na single attacker-\n\n181\n00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:24.371\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n182\n00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:27.714\n&gt;&gt; And abstracting that away.\n\n183\n00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:30.705\nSo for each attacker,\nwhat do I want to happen?\n\n184\n00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:37.980\nWell if(attacker), notice I'm just taking\nthis and rewriting it effectively.\n\n185\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n186\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:45.773\n&gt;&gt; And attacker.hitsEdge(this.screen),\n\n187\n00:10:45.773 --> 00:10:49.946\nthen what needs to happen?\n\n188\n00:10:49.946 --> 00:10:56.869\nWell attacker.dropDown(); otherwise,\n\n189\n00:10:59.023 --> 00:11:06.312\n(attacker), And\nlet's see here attacker.move.\n\n190\n00:11:08.745 --> 00:11:11.766\nJust like that, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:15.251\n&gt;&gt; Justin, do we need the first\npart of that if statement, it's\n\n192\n00:11:15.251 --> 00:11:19.893\nlike guaranteeing the attacker, I mean or\nis there something else that we can do?\n\n193\n00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:22.427\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nI think you might be on to something Zach.\n\n194\n00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:25.278\nLet's see if we get this working,\nbut I think I agree with you.\n\n195\n00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:29.434\nBecause iteration itself is not gonna\niterate over something that doesn't exist.\n\n196\n00:11:29.434 --> 00:11:34.265\nSo if this iteration occurs there\nare guarantees that there's an attacker in\n\n197\n00:11:34.265 --> 00:11:37.370\nthat collection, in that attacker-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n198\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.500\n&gt;&gt; So let's just leave that be for now.\n\n199\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.225\nLet's see if it works and hey, now\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:45.302\n&gt;&gt; All of our attackers are moving.\n\n201\n00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:48.504\nOkay, but let's now try to see-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n202\n00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:52.817\n&gt;&gt; If we remove this attacker, right?\n\n203\n00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:55.595\nAnd if it's the edge then drop down, and\n\n204\n00:11:55.595 --> 00:11:59.449\nwell we don't really need\nthis portion at all anymore.\n\n205\n00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:03.747\nI kinda of want to move regardless and\n\n206\n00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.392\nyeah-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n207\n00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I refresh, it's good to go.\n\n208\n00:12:08.414 --> 00:12:09.927\nOkay, so that works.\n\n209\n00:12:09.927 --> 00:12:14.234\nNow if we come back here,\nand I shoot a pellet,\n\n210\n00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:18.550\nthat's a rather portion that doesn't work.\n\n211\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.570\nSo our attackers are moving, that's good.\n\n212\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.739\nLet's worry about this pellets portion,\nright?\n\n213\n00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:29.656\nSo for this respective attacker,\nI kinda need a for loop and a for loop.\n\n214\n00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:33.675\nNow, I do forewarn you if you have\na great number of entities on the screen.\n\n215\n00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:37.452\nThen the forEach could possibly\nbe a performance bottleneck.\n\n216\n00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:39.730\nYou may have to go back to old school for\nloops.\n\n217\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.294\nIn addition to the computational\nkind of the time that it would take.\n\n218\n00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:47.491\nLet's say you have 1,000 pellets and\n1,000 attackers.\n\n219\n00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:52.252\nWe have to check 1,000 times 1,000\nwhich is 1 million iterations every\n\n220\n00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:53.567\ntime you draw a frame.\n\n221\n00:12:53.567 --> 00:12:55.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it gets a little out of hand, so\n\n222\n00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:57.039\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n223\n00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:01.106\nBut I'm gonna keep this pellets portion,\nI think that's okay.\n\n224\n00:13:01.106 --> 00:13:05.582\nAnd actually this is in orbit,\nthat's okay as well.\n\n225\n00:13:05.582 --> 00:13:09.860\nIt's just this portion right here, that\nI'm gonna comment out, just like we have.\n\n226\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:16.171\nAnd say, well this.attackers.forEach and\n\n227\n00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:23.302\nforEach((attacker and the attackerIndex)).\n\n228\n00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:27.915\nI can't reuse index,\nbecause it's already used for the pellets.\n\n229\n00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:30.334\nBecause I see here that\nI'm gonna have to get,\n\n230\n00:13:30.334 --> 00:13:32.826\nI'm probably gonna have\nto remove something.\n\n231\n00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:36.620\nAnd since it's in a collection, I need to\ndo something like I did in the pellet.\n\n232\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:43.963\nIf the attacker, Actually I don't need\nthat anymore, because that's again,\n\n233\n00:13:43.963 --> 00:13:47.012\nwhat Zach pointed out where we're\ntesting to see if it was null or not.\n\n234\n00:13:47.012 --> 00:13:49.592\nBut it's guaranteed to be there during or,\n\n235\n00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:52.669\nwell there's guaranteed\nto be something in there.\n\n236\n00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:55.122\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmeans its an attacker.\n\n237\n00:13:55.122 --> 00:13:59.908\nIf the pellet hits the attacker\n\n238\n00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:04.702\nwe are going through, right?\n\n239\n00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:12.715\nThen this.attackers.splice(attackerIndex\nof 1).\n\n240\n00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:17.600\nNow this is in situation,\nkind of mutation like I said before,\n\n241\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.651\nnot necessarily my greatest feeling.\n\n242\n00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:25.222\nBut sometimes there is a call for\nit, here we go.\n\n243\n00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:28.760\nSo if we look at this, for every one of\nthe attackers, for every pellet and for\n\n244\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.067\neveryone of the attackers,\n\n245\n00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:33.566\nwe're essentially checking if the pellet\nhas hit any one of the attackers.\n\n246\n00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:38.240\nSo if there's two pellets and\nthere's five possible attackers,\n\n247\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.840\nwe're checking ten combinations.\n\n248\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.310\nAll five attackers for this pellet,\nall five attackers for also this pellet.\n\n249\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.310\nAnd if any of those come in contact,\nwe're gonna remove the pellet and\n\n250\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.020\nremove the attacker.\n\n251\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.917\nSo now we would have this many,\nand once this one goes off screen,\n\n252\n00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:56.562\nthis one gets removed, and\nstill have our four attackers.\n\n253\n00:14:56.562 --> 00:15:02.007\nSo in this works out and\nwe were fresh, here we go.\n\n254\n00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:06.874\nHey, missed him and-\n&gt;&gt; They're coming to get you.\n\n255\n00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:11.920\n&gt;&gt; There we go, we have our attackers\nthat are used to the pellets,\n\n256\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.703\nand we're good to go.\n\n257\n00:15:13.703 --> 00:15:18.635\nSo we can remove that and\nwell I think that's pretty good.\n\n258\n00:15:18.635 --> 00:15:22.462\nLet me make sure that\nlook at game.pellets,\n\n259\n00:15:22.462 --> 00:15:27.304\nthe pellets do get removed still,\nif they go into orbit.\n\n260\n00:15:27.304 --> 00:15:31.964\nThat's good to go, and\nthere's our first swarm.\n\n261\n00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.905\n&gt;&gt; So Justin,\nthat seems like pretty weird behavior.\n\n262\n00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:36.365\nIs that what you were meaning to do?\n\n263\n00:15:36.365 --> 00:15:38.355\n&gt;&gt; Well full disclosure Zach, no.\n\n264\n00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it wasn't.\n\n265\n00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:43.662\nAnd in case, you didn't catch it,\nactually let's come back to the screen and\n\n266\n00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:45.370\nlook wha Zach's talking about.\n\n267\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.560\nIf we look, and as we come over here and\nwe're hitting the edge and that behavior\n\n268\n00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.775\nworked, except now they're independent-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n269\n00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:54.626\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n270\n00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:55.917\nI mean you could do that.\n\n271\n00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:57.199\n&gt;&gt; That could work.\n\n272\n00:15:57.199 --> 00:15:59.422\n&gt;&gt; It kinda reminds me of a snake,\nactually.\n\n273\n00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:01.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah a little bit.\n\n274\n00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:05.376\nWhat I wanted to happen was them to be\nconfined and to all stay on the same level\n\n275\n00:16:05.376 --> 00:16:10.010\nbecause there maybe some weirdness that\noccurs at this kind of intersection.\n\n276\n00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.890\nSee how they're overlapping and maybe,\nand then if you have multiple rows,\n\n277\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.788\nyou're gonna have [INAUDIBLE]\nkeep them spaced appropriately.\n\n278\n00:16:20.788 --> 00:16:21.500\nSo I didn't want that.\n\n279\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.650\nWhere does this occur?\n\n280\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.280\nThis actually occurs at this hit's edge.\n\n281\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.529\nWe're looking for each of the attackers.\n\n282\n00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:39.100\nAll right, if attacker hits the edge, that\nparticular attacker needs to move down.\n\n283\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.059\nThat's not what I want though, no.\n\n284\n00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:47.554\n[LAUGH] We need to kind of\nrestructure this a little bit,\n\n285\n00:16:47.554 --> 00:16:54.620\nbecause what I want is if any of them hit,\nI want all of them to drop down, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.930\nNotice that keyword, all.\n\n287\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.347\nSo I'm gonna introduce I\nthink a new function here.\n\n288\n00:16:59.347 --> 00:17:02.830\nI want all of them to drop\ndown if any of them hit.\n\n289\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.710\nNow what does this boolean mean?\n\n290\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.210\nThis hits edge, it's gonna return true\nif it hits the edge of the screen, for\n\n291\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.980\nany of them.\n\n292\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:16.642\nSo I think, if we come back here, let's\njust move this over and we pull this out.\n\n293\n00:17:16.642 --> 00:17:19.520\nI'm gonna pull this out because I\njust want to see if they'll move,\n\n294\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.600\nif this still works for movement.\n\n295\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.060\nAnd I'm gonna paste this,\nand comment this out.\n\n296\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.933\nSo if I refresh, all right,\nso they're still moving.\n\n297\n00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:30.640\nAnd I've effectively removed the behavior.\n\n298\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.510\nThey're gonna go off screen.\n\n299\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.530\nBut what I want is I want them to move.\n\n300\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:43.580\nHowever, it could be above or below, and\nyou may have to tweak that effectively.\n\n301\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.588\nAnd you may need to tweak that at some\npoint whether they move before they drop\n\n302\n00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:48.000\ndown or drop down before they move.\n\n303\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.540\nIf the attacker hits the edge,\nif any of them, any of them.\n\n304\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.000\nSo what I mean is I'm gonna check all the\nattackers and see if they've hit the edge.\n\n305\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.730\nBecause if they're moving to the right,\n\n306\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.910\nthe rightmost attacker is\ngonna hit the edge first.\n\n307\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.800\nIf I move to the left,\nthe leftmost attacker is gonna hit first.\n\n308\n00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.190\nAnd then if those get removed,\n\n309\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.470\nthe rightmost attacker is now something\nthat used to be in the middle.\n\n310\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.890\nSo that's some things that\nwe need to check here.\n\n311\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.840\nNow what I'm thinking\nis I have a function,\n\n312\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.040\nmaybe right here that I'm gonna call any.\n\n313\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.020\nAnd it's gonna take a bunch of booleans.\n\n314\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.378\nNow what booleans is it?\n\n315\n00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:34.240\nWhat do I mean by booleans?\n\n316\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.210\nIt's just a list a list\nof true false values.\n\n317\n00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.410\nHow am I gonna get those?\n\n318\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.880\nI'm gonna check to see if every attacker\nhas hit the wall and I'm gonna get true,\n\n319\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.970\ntrue, false, false, true, false.\n\n320\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.990\nAnd I'm just going to get a list back.\n\n321\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.400\nThat's my thought.\n\n322\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.499\nAnd then, for any of them, I'm just gonna\n\n323\n00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:57.870\nloop through those for(let b of booleans).\n\n324\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.018\nI'm gonna return, wait a minute.\n\n325\n00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.282\nIf b, now what do I mean by if(b)?\n\n326\n00:19:06.282 --> 00:19:11.002\nI mean, if any of that is true,\nI'm looking for any of them to be true,\n\n327\n00:19:11.002 --> 00:19:12.530\nthen I wanna return b.\n\n328\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.580\nOtherwise, return false.\n\n329\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.940\nThat means that none of them were true.\n\n330\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.680\nSo I either want just one,\nthey could all be true.\n\n331\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.330\nBut I need just one so I can short circuit\nthis calculation actually ends up being\n\n332\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.790\na little easier to reason about.\n\n333\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.260\nSo I have written it this way.\n\n334\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.570\nThere are ways where you can just do,\nI wanna take this and or it with the next.\n\n335\n00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.350\nOr, or, or, or, and\nthen you'll get the result.\n\n336\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.690\nBut this way, as soon as I find it true,\nI'm just returning true.\n\n337\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.300\nWe're good to go.\n\n338\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n339\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:48.629\n&gt;&gt; So if any of those are true,\nand how am I going to\n\n340\n00:19:48.629 --> 00:19:55.070\nuse that here?\n\n341\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.281\nEdge, Determination.\n\n342\n00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:03.660\nActually EdgeHits, right?\n\n343\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.270\nNot the greatest variable name, but\nyou'll see what I mean in just a moment.\n\n344\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.810\nSo this.attackers, and\nthen I'm gonna map, and for\n\n345\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:16.390\nevery attacker,\nI want to find if the attacker\n\n346\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:21.760\nhits the edge of this.screen.\n\n347\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.940\nAll right, and I'm going to move this\ndown so we can actually see this.\n\n348\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.190\nAnd I'm going to move that.\n\n349\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.039\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n350\n00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:33.150\nA little bit of stair stepping there,\nbut that'll be all right.\n\n351\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.465\nSo go through the attackers.\n\n352\n00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:36.760\nMap, that means transform this.\n\n353\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.689\nAnd let me just show you what this is.\n\n354\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.240\nI'm going to say debugger,\nand stop it at that moment.\n\n355\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.930\nThere it is.\n\n356\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:46.550\nSent to debugger.\n\n357\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.180\nattackersEdgeHits, false,\nfalse, false, false, false.\n\n358\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.690\nOkay, that means the attackers\nhave not hit the edge yet.\n\n359\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.160\nIf I say allAttackersEdgeHits.\n\n360\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.670\nExcuse me, not all,\nI confused myself there.\n\n361\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.390\nAny, no none of them, right.\n\n362\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.660\nNone of them hit.\n\n363\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.730\nHowever, if I come in here and\nchange this, let's say I mutate this and\n\n364\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.270\nsay, zeroth one equals true.\n\n365\n00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:23.210\nThen attackersEdgeHits, I have true,\nfalse, false, false, false, false.\n\n366\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.680\nOne of them did hit the edge.\n\n367\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680\nLooks like the leftmost one.\n\n368\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.660\nIf I come back and run any on that,\nI'm gonna get true.\n\n369\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.720\nAnd at that point, at that point,\n\n370\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.260\nthat's when I want to see if\nany attackers hit the edge.\n\n371\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.700\nAnd then drop all of\nthem down if they did.\n\n372\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.060\nSo I'm gonna use that to my advantage.\n\n373\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.140\nAnd as a matter of fact,\nI'm going to wrap this in\n\n374\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:59.400\nany, AnyAttackerHitEdge.\n\n375\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.710\nIt's a long variable name, I know,\nbut it's very descriptive and\n\n376\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.810\nI don't have to think about what it means.\n\n377\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.200\nRight, because this statement alone is\nactually there's a lot buried in it.\n\n378\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.847\nSo I get a bunch of true false values and\nI find the any.\n\n379\n00:22:10.847 --> 00:22:14.051\nAnd you have to be careful here\nbecause I don't have strictness.\n\n380\n00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.360\nI have some truthy false stuff\nthat will happen in JavaScript.\n\n381\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.850\nSo if you have something that's\nlike one or non-truthy fact,\n\n382\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.690\nit'll still work, so do keep that in mind.\n\n383\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.065\nBut now what I can do is say,\n\n384\n00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:38.869\nif (didAnyattackersHitEdge), if they did,\n\n385\n00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:46.105\nthen this.attackers.forEach(attacker\n\n386\n00:22:46.105 --> 00:22:51.840\n=&gt; attacker.dropDown()).\n\n387\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.681\nSo if AnyAttackerHitEdge,\nand let me rename that.\n\n388\n00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:58.834\nAnyAttackerHitEdges.\n\n389\n00:22:58.834 --> 00:23:01.160\nThere we go.\n\n390\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.320\nIf any attacker hit the edge,\nthen all of the attackers drop down.\n\n391\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd I think we should see a resolution\nto that respective thing.\n\n392\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.718\n[SOUND] And\nnow we're back to the collective chunk.\n\n393\n00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:18.515\n&gt;&gt; They're marching in lockstep.\n\n394\n00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:21.665\n&gt;&gt; I want one final kind of test here.\n\n395\n00:23:23.405 --> 00:23:28.215\nSo I removed that respective attacker,\nright, on the leftmost edge.\n\n396\n00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:33.300\nLet's see if it drops down from the\noriginal one, or it actually skips that.\n\n397\n00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:38.583\nThe longer path,\nthat actually keeps the, helps you, so\n\n398\n00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:43.591\nthe more you take out along the edges,\nyou could use a strategy to say, well,\n\n399\n00:23:43.591 --> 00:23:47.540\nthat's not fair because now it's\ngonna travel a longer path.\n\n400\n00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.450\nWhat I would really like is\nit's defined at those points.\n\n401\n00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:55.220\nBut we said we're gonna\ncreate a swarm there.\n\n402\n00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.970\nAnd you know, Zach, I'm thinking.\n\n403\n00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.320\nI like this but\nI'm not necessarily in love with it.\n\n404\n00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.990\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit looks like we're done with it, though.\n\n405\n00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.250\nAre we done with it?\n\n406\n00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.460\n&gt;&gt; We could call it done,\nbut I don't know.\n\n407\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.340\nThere's something in my gut that says\nyou should probably change that out\n\n408\n00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.000\na little bit.\n\n409\n00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.040\nAs a matter of fact, I think maybe\nwe'll come back in a part two and\n\n410\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.788\nactually change this into a swarm object.\n\n411\n00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:20.513\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n\n412\n00:24:20.513 --> 00:24:21.999\n&gt;&gt; And what I mean by a swarm object is,\n\n413\n00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:24.660\nit's a containing object\nwith a bunch of attackers.\n\n414\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.310\nAnd then we change how\nthe interaction goes.\n\n415\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.944\nMainly because we have a lot of loops and\nloops and loops, and\n\n416\n00:24:31.944 --> 00:24:35.450\nwe can pull those away, hide those\nbehind the scenes in a swarm object, and\n\n417\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.365\nthat'll clean up our code,\nmake it a little easier to reason about.\n\n418\n00:24:38.365 --> 00:24:41.760\nSo I think we're gonna come back and\ndo that.\n\n419\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\nthis has been creating a swarm part one.\n\n420\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.180\nThere will be a creating a swarm part two.\n\n421\n00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.100\nSo make sure you see\nboth of those episodes.\n\n422\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.860\nJustin, I know you wanna\nsay something else.\n\n423\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.580\nI can tell.\n\n424\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is one of those things\nwhere I was like, I think I like this,\n\n425\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.060\nbut there's a lot of loops and\nloops and loops.\n\n426\n00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.500\nMaybe we can use abstraction on\nour side to increase readability.\n\n427\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.280\nAnd this is a good chance.\n\n428\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.080\nWe don't have to do what I'm proposing,\nbut maybe we'll get started on that and\n\n429\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.590\nsee how it goes, and if I don't like it,\nI'll just undo all of it.\n\n430\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.420\nBut hopefully you'll be there to\nsee me either crash and burn or\n\n431\n00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.615\nsucceed wonderfully.\n\n432\n00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:17.434\n&gt;&gt; That's because you do a wonderful job,\nand you\n\n433\n00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:22.370\nreally do care about how we perceive your\nteaching or your tutelage, I must say.\n\n434\n00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.840\nYou have very good tutelage.\n\n435\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.658\nSo make sure you watch every single\nepisode of HTML 5, Canvas Projects, and\n\n436\n00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:31.476\ngo to our course library and check out\nthe hundreds of videos there that are all\n\n437\n00:25:31.476 --> 00:25:33.580\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n438\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.650\nAnd tell a friend about DEVPro.TV.\n\n439\n00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.130\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n440\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.910\nThanks for

Well, you said let's go,\nso let's go Zach.\n\n8\n00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.525\nBut, before we do, how are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.870\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, I'm very excited.\n\n10\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.068\nAnd you said we we're coming\nback with a Swarm object, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:39.877\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n12\n00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:43.420\nis this just to increase\nthe readability or what's going on?\n\n13\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.930\n&gt;&gt; So, I'll just be completely honest.\n\n14\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.385\nI think it's gonna be\na little more readable.\n\n15\n00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And abstract,\n\n16\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.055\nthe way some of those loops, and\nloops, and loops, and loops.\n\n17\n00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.875\nAnd we can change some of the,\nwe don't have to do this,\n\n18\n00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.640\nthis is just a decision that I've made\nbecause I like things to be clear.\n\n19\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.660\nRight, I'm gonna extract away and\nhide some of the stuff in objects.\n\n20\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.161\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That way I don't have to go,\n\n21\n00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.475\nall right so now I have to\nloop over these other things.\n\n22\n00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:12.516\nAnd that way I have this kind of pallet of\nobjects that I can use to create my logic.\n\n23\n00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:17.014\nLike right now in our code we have inside\nthe pallets, inside of the attackers,\n\n24\n00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:18.100\nwe have this loop.\n\n25\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.801\nNow, I'm not gonna go crazy and\nI could do this for the pallets and\n\n26\n00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:25.852\nthe Swarm I think makes sense,\nbecause I want the swarm to stay unison.\n\n27\n00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:30.889\nAnd I don't want it to hit\nthe edge when it first comes up.\n\n28\n00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.257\nWhat I mean is,\nif I get rid of the left hand or\n\n29\n00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:37.182\nthe right hand most attacker,\nI don't want to Swarm them to scoot away.\n\n30\n00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:41.350\nI still want it to have this\ninvisible edge that it hits against.\n\n31\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090\nSo by doing that I can create an object\nthat says here's our left hand side,\n\n32\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.650\nhere's our right hand most side.\n\n33\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.220\nAnd then just keep those\nin the object itself and\n\n34\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.980\nalways be able to reference\nthose internal to the object.\n\n35\n00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.350\nThat way I can keep the boundaries that\nare established upon the creation of\n\n36\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.320\nthe Swarm without all kinds of crazy\nlogic inside of the main game loop.\n\n37\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.113\n&gt;&gt; So what you're telling me Justin,\n\n38\n00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:06.110\nis that we don't need that\ncreateSwarm function any more.\n\n39\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're probably gonna delete that.\n\n40\n00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:10.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nthat does bring me to another good point,\n\n41\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.180\nwe should probably do a little bit of\nclean up first, it's not gonna take long.\n\n42\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.350\nA little bit of pulling things\nout of the respective app.js cuz\n\n43\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.860\nwe may need to reuse those on other files.\n\n44\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.690\nSo let's go and take a look at the screen\nhere and do a little bit of cleanup.\n\n45\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.120\nWhat I'm gonna do, is that createSwarm,\nI'm gonna keep that just for a moment.\n\n46\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.470\nWe may use that internal\nto the actual Swarm, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.590\nThe createSwarm in that case\nwould be pre the collection.\n\n48\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.090\nNow, we may still need that\ninside of the Swarm object, but\n\n49\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.443\nwe wanna attach other methods.\n\n50\n00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.857\nSo I'm gonna do that, and\nI'm gonna come over here and\n\n51\n00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:46.465\nopen the side panel, and create a Swarm.\n\n52\n00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.668\nSo swarm.js, and\nI'm just going to go ahead and paste that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:52.390\nI'm not entirely sold\nthat we don't need that.\n\n54\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.770\nIn addition to, there's this inning.\n\n55\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.777\nNow, this any,\nI could leave this here, but\n\n56\n00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:02.565\nthose are long in the app.js,\nit's kind of utilitarian in function.\n\n57\n00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:09.426\nI'm gonna grab that to clean up our\nfile again and make a utils file.\n\n58\n00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:15.130\nSo utils and js just like so\nand then paste that.\n\n59\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.686\nNow I'm just going to kind\nof leave that for now.\n\n60\n00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:22.322\nIf I was doing a real build or something,\n\n61\n00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.110\nI would probably put\nthis in a utils module.\n\n62\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.390\nOr at least namespace it with utils\nas I've done in previous episodes or\n\n63\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660\nother projects that you\nmay have seen me build.\n\n64\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.980\nI'm just gonna leave that for now, just so\nI don't have to do other refactoring.\n\n65\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.200\nBut I do need to include\nthose files on the page.\n\n66\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.280\nNow that brings me to a point about\nkind of when to include things.\n\n67\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.590\nUtils may be used in anything below it.\n\n68\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.610\nSo I'm gonna put that first, but for\n\n69\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.540\nthe Swarm,\nI really don't need that until the app.js.\n\n70\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.340\nSo Swarm, I'm just gonna put at\nthe end and that gives me kind of\n\n71\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.540\na history of progression of how\nthese things have come to be.\n\n72\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.350\nAin't no nothing special about that,\nso it still works.\n\n73\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if it hits the edge and\n\n74\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.160\nit does and we're good.\n\n75\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.330\nNow what I'm trying to get away from\nis if I hit that one with the pellet,\n\n76\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.570\nthe boundary of the Swarm\nactually contracts.\n\n77\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n78\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.100\n&gt;&gt; So, and that kinda puts the attackers\nat a disadvantage, because\n\n79\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.640\nnow they have to travel a longer path and\nyou have a longer time to hit them.\n\n80\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.820\nI'm just gonna change the dynamics\nbecause I want that edge to stay.\n\n81\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.922\nSo if I get rid of all the attackers, if\nthe original Swarm boundary hits the edge,\n\n82\n00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:31.896\nI still want the attacker to drop down.\n\n83\n00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.901\nAnd that makes it a little more difficult,\nas far as how long it would take,\n\n84\n00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.285\nbecause what I could do now,\nis I can always try to hit the edge.\n\n85\n00:04:41.777 --> 00:04:42.990\nAll right, I hit all of those edges.\n\n86\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.680\nNow, I would probably also speed these up.\n\n87\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.270\nBut now, this is really long path,\n\n88\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.330\nand I could just, and\nI can kind of just leave that one.\n\n89\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.520\nSo let's change it up a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.448\nLet's make it a little\nmore of a fair fight.\n\n91\n00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:01.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now you may disagree with this,\n\n92\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.730\nyou don't wanna do this.\n\n93\n00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.090\nThat's perfectly okay.\n\n94\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.230\nBut we have everything still working.\n\n95\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.570\nWe're good to go.\n\n96\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.670\nAnd one final thing,\n\n97\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.164\nwe have some commented out code\nhere that I'm just going to remove.\n\n98\n00:05:11.164 --> 00:05:14.460\nNow what this also means is\nby creating the Swarm object,\n\n99\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.800\nsome of the code that we wrote in Part\n1 is actually going to change as well.\n\n100\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.320\nBecause, right, attackers.move,\nwell attackers, that's actually the Swarm.\n\n101\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.720\nSo we'll change that.\n\n102\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.200\nAnd that also means inside of\nthe game we're gonna have a different\n\n103\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.010\nkind of thing here.\n\n104\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.716\nSo let's go build that Swarm object and\nlet's close out some of these files.\n\n105\n00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:41.880\nIt's getting a little crazy\nup in here in my editor.\n\n106\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.795\nSo close those files out and let's create\n\n107\n00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:52.280\na Swarm class, and here's the constructor.\n\n108\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.717\nAnd I think the constructor would\nprobably take this x and the y, right,\n\n109\n00:05:56.717 --> 00:06:00.150\nwhere this Swarm's gonna originate from.\n\n110\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.250\nAnd I'm always gonna assume\nthat it's a single row.\n\n111\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.670\nWe could make it to where there's\na single row with multiple columns.\n\n112\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.150\nWe could have multiple rows and\nmultiple columns.\n\n113\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.110\nBut maybe we'll leave that for\nan exercise for the reader.\n\n114\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.740\n&gt;&gt; That's a classic cop out.\n\n115\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll just say n.\n\n116\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.740\nSo this is the number of attackers, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.442\nNow if I was using a module,\n\n118\n00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:25.280\nI would've probably just called\nthis inside and keep this.\n\n119\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.020\nBut we could put this inside\nof the respective Swarm.\n\n120\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.080\nI'm not gonna use the createSwarm\nfunction outside of this file, but\n\n121\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.950\nit would be available.\n\n122\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.290\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say\nattackers createSwarm x, y and then n.\n\n123\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.590\nSo n in this case is gonna\nbe the number of attackers.\n\n124\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.870\nMoreover, I'm going to say x = x,\nthis.y = y\n\n125\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.250\ncuz that's my initial boundary for\nthe Swarm, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.306\nNow there's a problem.\n\n127\n00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:12.230\nThis Swarm right here, that's gonna\ncreate my right hand boundary.\n\n128\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.700\nSo I need some way to get at that.\n\n129\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.810\nI'm gonna grab the right\nhand boundary by saying,\n\n130\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.400\nlet's see, a little bit of set up here.\n\n131\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.301\nSo the lastAttacker is equal to\n\n132\n00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:34.207\nthis.attackers.reverse.\n\n133\n00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:37.570\nSo I'm switching the order, right?\n\n134\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.710\nAnd I'm gonna grab the first one.\n\n135\n00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.948\nAnd what I mean is,\nI'm gonna use destructuring just so\n\n136\n00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:49.736\nI don't have any out of bounds\nerrors if possible, so others.\n\n137\n00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:53.621\nSo by reversing that, I get the\nlastAttacker by just destructuring, and\n\n138\n00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:57.957\nthis is effectively a throwaway variable\nhere, I don't really care about that.\n\n139\n00:07:57.957 --> 00:07:58.715\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n140\n00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:03.035\n&gt;&gt; So there's our lastAttacker So\n\n141\n00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:08.315\nthis x and\nthis y is our left hand side and\n\n142\n00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:13.597\nmaybe we should say, leftX and leftY.\n\n143\n00:08:13.597 --> 00:08:18.184\nAnd now we need this rightX =\n\n144\n00:08:18.184 --> 00:08:24.120\nlastAttacker.x + lastAttacker.\n\n145\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.750\nAnd then if we look at attacker,\nwe have this property called width.\n\n146\n00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.770\nSo we actually wanna\nmove over to the width.\n\n147\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:37.050\nSo we wanna get that exterior boundary,\nand width.\n\n148\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:45.266\nAnd then this.rightY = lastAttacker.y.\n\n149\n00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:49.762\nNow I just grabbed all these\nbecause we may need them but\n\n150\n00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.120\nI did that kind of knee jerk.\n\n151\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.060\nWe only use X to determine the boundary.\n\n152\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.060\nSo we may not need those.\n\n153\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.160\nAnd we're coming to remove those.\n\n154\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.530\nSo we have that kind of set up.\n\n155\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.370\nAnd this was kind of a copy out for me.\n\n156\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.228\nFor this swarm, what I'm thinking,\n\n157\n00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:13.654\nis I should be able to break\nthings very effectively by\n\n158\n00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:19.324\ncoming into ab.js and\ninstead of saying create swarm,\n\n159\n00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:24.893\nI'm going to say new Swarm (100, 100, 5).\n\n160\n00:09:24.893 --> 00:09:27.000\nAnd we're gonna see a break.\n\n161\n00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.660\nIt's broke.\n\n162\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.220\nAll kinds of broke.\n\n163\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Now why has it broken?\n\n164\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.360\nBecause attackers is no longer an array.\n\n165\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.510\nNow I could just expose those.\n\n166\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.200\nBut what I really want is I want\nswarm to be equal to swarm.\n\n167\n00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:48.370\nAnd now that should, map of undefined,\nsee attackers is undefined now.\n\n168\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.943\nA bunch of stuff is broken, so\nI'm going to comment this out,\n\n169\n00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:56.088\nI'm going to comment all of this out,\nand I'm gonna comment this out.\n\n170\n00:09:56.088 --> 00:09:58.986\nJust to see if we can get\nback to our working state,\n\n171\n00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:01.420\nand I'm gonna comment this out.\n\n172\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.480\nOkay?\n\n173\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.230\nSo I come back and I refresh.\n\n174\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.760\nAll right, so we're non broken.\n\n175\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.710\nBut by changing the effective\nobject of this.\n\n176\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.500\nLike I have a swarm now.\n\n177\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.830\nI need to be able to render the swarm.\n\n178\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.400\nRight?\n\n179\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, this.swarm.render(this.context).\n\n180\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.950\nWell that looks a lot like the other ones.\n\n181\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.590\nNow I could do the exact same thing for\npellets, but I would try it with pellets.\n\n182\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:36.220\nA pellet stream, or\nmaybe just pellets entity.\n\n183\n00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.030\nOr pellets collection, pellets list.\n\n184\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.780\nI'm going to leave that,\njust for comparison.\n\n185\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.400\nSo I'm going to render the swarm.\n\n186\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.530\nWell the swarm doesn't have a render\nmethod, so this would actually break.\n\n187\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.397\nBut if I come in here and\nI render with a context,\n\n188\n00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:52.796\neffectively what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to say this.attackers.\n\n189\n00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:55.016\nSo the swarms attackers.\n\n190\n00:10:55.016 --> 00:11:02.003\nforEach(attacker =&gt; attacker.render) for\n\n191\n00:11:02.003 --> 00:11:05.880\nthe context like so.\n\n192\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.214\nSo I've hidden that away in swarm.render.\n\n193\n00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:10.410\nLet's see if it works.\n\n194\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.740\nAnd it does.\n\n195\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.050\nOkay.\n\n196\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.170\nNow what that means, if we come over here,\nwhat's our next kind of option.\n\n197\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.780\nI'm gonna remove this.\n\n198\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.490\nThat has increased my readability a little\nbit because I have a bunch of attack,\n\n199\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.920\nthe swarm is moving.\n\n200\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.480\nI mean that to be a collective thing.\n\n201\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.850\nLet's come back down here and look for\n\n202\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.930\nthis attackers.move,\nlet's get the swarm moving again.\n\n203\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.310\nI said moving just a moment ago,\nI meant rendering.\n\n204\n00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.229\nSo what I want to do is say,\n\n205\n00:11:42.229 --> 00:11:47.097\nthis.swarm.move() just like that.\n\n206\n00:11:47.097 --> 00:11:50.040\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n207\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.646\nThat means we get to take this,\nand cut this out and\n\n208\n00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:58.260\nwe come back over to swarm,\nand we make them move.\n\n209\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.760\nLike so.\n\n210\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.394\nAnd we just paste it back in, and\n\n211\n00:12:04.394 --> 00:12:09.864\nactually we don't even\nneed more than one line.\n\n212\n00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:13.872\nNow again, not necessary in\nthe grand scheme of things,\n\n213\n00:12:13.872 --> 00:12:16.470\nyou could have left it the other way.\n\n214\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.745\nBut by going to the wrong area,\nI can show you nothing.\n\n215\n00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:22.190\nThis.swarm move.\n\n216\n00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.539\nAnd does it move?\n\n217\n00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:26.360\nAnd it does move, there we go.\n\n218\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.356\nSo, we're good on that one.\n\n219\n00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:29.520\n&gt;&gt; But they're going bye-bye.\n\n220\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.620\n&gt;&gt; But they're going bye-bye.\n\n221\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.710\nSo, we need to address this\nswarm hits edge, right?\n\n222\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.711\n&gt;&gt; So, the swarm hits edge\n&gt;&gt; I think if we do this,\n\n223\n00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:51.439\nIf this.swarm.hitsEdge for\n\n224\n00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:55.627\nwhat, this.screen then I\n\n225\n00:12:55.627 --> 00:13:00.550\nwant this.swarm to drop down.\n\n226\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.530\nNow, this is going to break because\nthese two methods don't exist.\n\n227\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:10.199\nBut if I come back and I say,\n\n228\n00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:14.462\nhits edge and drop down,\n\n229\n00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:18.526\nthen what is hits edge?\n\n230\n00:13:20.824 --> 00:13:24.790\nIt is going to be the return of this.\n\n231\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.840\nSo if I come back and I return this and\nI uncomment and I comment.\n\n232\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.470\nI can just remove that and\nhave these over.\n\n233\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.870\nThere we go, so if the swarm hits the\nedge, how do we know if it hits the edge?\n\n234\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.082\nWell, if any of the attackers\nhit the edge, right,\n\n235\n00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:48.565\nso we're kinda just refactoring this,\n\n236\n00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:53.543\nthis edge may have to change cause this is\nnot going to change any of our behavior.\n\n237\n00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:56.225\nWe just want to make\nsure this still works.\n\n238\n00:13:56.225 --> 00:13:57.700\nAnd then dropDown.\n\n239\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:04.687\nWhat is that,\nthis.attcakers.forEach(attacker\n\n240\n00:14:04.687 --> 00:14:09.700\n=&gt; attacker.dropDown()); And\n\n241\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.220\nnow if I come back and I refresh.\n\n242\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.700\nIf I actually hit R.\n\n243\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.937\nOh-oh cannot find property\nwith [INAUDIBLE].\n\n244\n00:14:18.937 --> 00:14:25.096\nAnd that's because,\nthere should be some screen object or\n\n245\n00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:30.775\nboundary and then we can go over here and\nput boundary.\n\n246\n00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:36.190\nAnd there we go, let's see-\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it.\n\n247\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.860\n&gt;&gt; If it actually drops down and\n\n248\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.570\nnow we still have maintained\nour exact same thing.\n\n249\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.120\nYes Zack.\n\n250\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.320\n&gt;&gt; But Justin,\ndo we have to name those the same thing?\n\n251\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.960\n&gt;&gt; We don't have to, but\nthat is a good observation and\n\n252\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.880\nthat's probably a great common question.\n\n253\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.600\nI've done this to draw a corollary to\nthere's this parent object that has\n\n254\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.490\na collection of children that\nis essentially the proxy.\n\n255\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.600\nSo I have the same API for the swarm\nas I do for an individual attacker.\n\n256\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.960\nAnd I've done that to say,\n\n257\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.260\nreally all we're doing is we're\nbundling this up into a dropDown.\n\n258\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.230\nWe're going to dropDown for\nall the children.\n\n259\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.945\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nOkay.\n\n260\n00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.510\n&gt;&gt; If it hitsEdge we're going to,\nhits the edge for all of the children.\n\n261\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.520\nNow, what that means is I can then have\nkind of the same readability that I had.\n\n262\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.780\nSo if the swarm hits the edge,\nthen the swarm drops down.\n\n263\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.880\nAnd I've cleaned up a lot of those for\n\n264\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.530\nloops that were kind of\ncluttering up things.\n\n265\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.360\nIf the swarm hits the edge,\nboom, there we go.\n\n266\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.788\nAnd I could do the same thing for pellets,\nbut again we're gonna leave that be.\n\n267\n00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:43.090\nI don't have to do that,\nas far as the naming.\n\n268\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But it helps me kind of\n\n269\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.758\ncreate a correlation between all\nthe attacker has a hits edge.\n\n270\n00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:50.764\nSo and this swarm should have a hits edge,\nmaybe a swarm shouldn't move and\n\n271\n00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:52.060\nthe attacker shouldn't move.\n\n272\n00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.093\nSo a swarm moves collectively but\nhow does a swarm move?\n\n273\n00:15:55.093 --> 00:15:58.262\nThe individual pieces of said\nswarm have to also move.\n\n274\n00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:00.452\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're doing but\n\n275\n00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:04.457\nthat was a good observation But\nthat brings my second point about this.\n\n276\n00:16:04.457 --> 00:16:08.190\nWhat that also means, that I can change\nthe underlying implementation details.\n\n277\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:08.850\nLike the hits edge.\n\n278\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.200\nWhat is the hits edge?\n\n279\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.950\nWell, I actually want to check\nto see if the right X has hit\n\n280\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.445\nthe width of the boundary.\n\n281\n00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; Or if the left X is less then zero.\n\n282\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.100\nSo, I've removed the need for this.\n\n283\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.350\nSo, it's essentially this exact\nsame expression but now it's for\n\n284\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:36.478\nswarm because I've created a bounding\nbox for the swarm as a collect hole.\n\n285\n00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:39.530\nAnd by doing that,\nmaintaining the same API but\n\n286\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.710\nI don't have to keep this portion,\nI could.\n\n287\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.660\nSo if I wanted to maintain\nthe same behavior but\n\n288\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.410\nprovide this abstraction, that's fine.\n\n289\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:55.077\nBut what I really want to know is if\nthis.leftX is less than or equal to zero.\n\n290\n00:16:55.077 --> 00:17:00.112\nOr this.rightX is greater than or\n\n291\n00:17:00.112 --> 00:17:04.805\nequal to the boundary.width.\n\n292\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.820\nAnd as a result we don't\nactually need to keep this y or\n\n293\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.080\nthis y as I observed earlier.\n\n294\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.700\nBut let's go ahead and clean that up.\n\n295\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.840\nAnd now what we should see is regardless\nof removing the individual pieces,\n\n296\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.250\nwe should get the boundary\nto stay the same.\n\n297\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.140\nNow, we can't do that yet\nbecause we have one final method.\n\n298\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.310\nBefore we can test that, we have one\nfinal method, this attackers portion,\n\n299\n00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.895\nwe can't remove anything because we\ncan't check to see if it's been hit.\n\n300\n00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:41.974\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the reason this hasn't errored\n\n301\n00:17:41.974 --> 00:17:46.910\ndown is because this inner function hasn't\nrun because I haven't fired any pellets.\n\n302\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.730\nSo we should probably do that first\nbefore we can worry to see if this works.\n\n303\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.560\nSo what I'm thinking is\nlet's comment out this,\n\n304\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.690\nand see if anything, okay that's good.\n\n305\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.257\nAnd now what I'm thinking\nis I'll have something\n\n306\n00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:19.600\nlike this.swarm.getsHitBy(pellet)\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n307\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:26.200\nSo if that's the case,\nThen what do I wanna do?\n\n308\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.350\nWell, I think this is where\nI want to remove the pellet,\n\n309\n00:18:31.782 --> 00:18:35.935\nSplice(index,1).\n\n310\n00:18:35.935 --> 00:18:41.112\nSo if the swarm gets hit by the pellet,\nthen I wanna remove the pellet but\n\n311\n00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:45.186\nI kind of want the swarm to\ntake care of everything else.\n\n312\n00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:49.168\nSo I come over here to swarm I should\nprobably add this gets hit by.\n\n313\n00:18:49.168 --> 00:18:54.890\nAnd getsHitBy something\nother doesn't necessarily\n\n314\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.525\nhave to be pellet it can be something\nthat conforms to this respective piece.\n\n315\n00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:04.306\n[COUGH] And now,\nI'm gonna grant this portion.\n\n316\n00:19:04.306 --> 00:19:07.240\nI think, I think.\n\n317\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.632\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n318\n00:19:11.979 --> 00:19:17.550\nAnd gets hit by, where'd I put\nthat we're in the wrong file.\n\n319\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.420\nIt's hit by other and\npaste and then I can do this.\n\n320\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.410\nSo, yeah we got some things to discuss.\n\n321\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.110\nIt looks like you got a question for\nme Zack.\n\n322\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, do we have to switch\nthose round like that,\n\n323\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.980\nI mean what's the logic behind it.\n\n324\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.620\n&gt;&gt; So, I think, we don't have to.\n\n325\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.070\nWe can figure out a way to make it work,\nbut what I'm thinking is, now,\n\n326\n00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.880\ninstead of checking one pallet to many-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n327\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.500\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n328\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.000\nI'm checking one-to-one,\nwhere the one-to-one is a swarm.\n\n329\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.690\nI wanna know if the swarm has been hit.\n\n330\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n331\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.720\nIn addition to, I want the swarm to,\nthe swarms hit, but\n\n332\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.110\nthen everything else will be hidden away,\n\n333\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.680\nbecause I don't wanna access the attackers\ninside of the swarm from external of that.\n\n334\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.410\nI'm gonna let swarm take care of itself.\n\n335\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n336\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.240\n&gt;&gt; And what that means is this is gonna\nreturn true or false in addition to,\n\n337\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.960\nso this method kinda, it does a little\nmore than it probably should, but\n\n338\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.200\nthis is a good first attempt.\n\n339\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.460\nIf it gets hit, it's gonna remove\nthe attacker from the swarm, but\n\n340\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.010\nit's also going to return true.\n\n341\n00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.230\nIn that way,\n\n342\n00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.706\nwe know this respective pellet needs\nto be remove from the pellet list.\n\n343\n00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:34.600\nAnd I want to just switch those around but\nI think it reads a little easier if you\n\n344\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.817\nsay, did the swarm get hit by,\nversus did the pellet hit a swarm and\n\n345\n00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:43.638\nnow we have to change how the pellet\nbehaves because the swarm is a collection\n\n346\n00:20:43.638 --> 00:20:47.215\nof things instead of the others,\nthe other way around.\n\n347\n00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:50.090\nOr the swarm is checking for a palette.\n\n348\n00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.530\nNow what that does mean is this other,\n\n349\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.130\nhere this other, now should go away,\ndon't have this.\n\n350\n00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.340\nAnd there we go, now gets hit by\n\n351\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.590\nI'm kind of relying on the other thing to\nnotify me, hey did you hit the attacker?\n\n352\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.580\nRight the other thing.\n\n353\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.560\nHey did you hit the attacker?\n\n354\n00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.078\nYeah sure.\n[COUGH] But\n\n355\n00:21:15.078 --> 00:21:18.700\nwe have a little bit of a problem.\n\n356\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.860\nWe don't have a true or false return type.\n\n357\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.840\nI'm kind of melding this into what I want.\n\n358\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.860\n&gt;&gt; I like melding.\n\n359\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:35.030\n&gt;&gt; So let result = false and\nif the other thing which is a pellet and\n\n360\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:41.010\nactually let me rename that to pellet so\nwe're all clear.\n\n361\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.765\nIf the pellet hits the attacker the pellet\nthat's passed in that we're checking.\n\n362\n00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n363\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.800\n&gt;&gt; Then we're going to splice out\nthat attacker because it's been hit.\n\n364\n00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.520\nWe're also need to return false so\n\n365\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.520\nwe can reflectively communicate\nthrough the game object.\n\n366\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.260\nSo what I want to do is\nsay result equals true.\n\n367\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.770\nSo as soon as it gets hit, if one of\nthe attacker gets hit, then the swarm,\n\n368\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.910\neffectively, by proxy, has been hit.\n\n369\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:08.710\nAnd I want to return\nthe result as a result.\n\n370\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.780\nSo if none of these ever get hit,\nthen this will be false, and\n\n371\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.920\nwe will not be removing the pellet.\n\n372\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.937\nIf any of the attacker gets hit,\nthen, yeah, the swarm was hit,\n\n373\n00:22:20.937 --> 00:22:26.333\nand there we go, we need to actually\nremove the object from the array.\n\n374\n00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.580\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n375\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n376\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.730\n&gt;&gt; So let's see, there we go.\n\n377\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.842\nAnd aah, we still have,\nI think we got this portion\n\n378\n00:22:41.842 --> 00:22:46.410\nkind of working like I want it to but this\nis increased readability a little bit.\n\n379\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.150\nThe pellets were still doing for and\nwe could do further abstractions.\n\n380\n00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.510\nIf the swarm gets hit by the pellet,\nremove that pellet and\n\n381\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.170\nthen the swarm takes care of\nit's own objects, it's own data.\n\n382\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.910\nIf the pellet is in that orbit, remove it.\n\n383\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.410\nGot it.\n\n384\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:08.200\nIf this swarm hits edge, okay, so\nit looks like this is not occurring.\n\n385\n00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.130\nSo it hits edge.\n\n386\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.410\nSo I've got an issue here.\n\n387\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.140\nI need to come over to the swarm.\n\n388\n00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.660\nAnd this is some of the live action\ndebugging [CROSSTALK] that I love does.\n\n389\n00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n390\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.770\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n&gt;&gt; It's those teachable moments.\n\n391\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:25.756\n&gt;&gt; So let's put a console.log of,\ndo I have those right?\n\n392\n00:23:25.756 --> 00:23:32.104\nOf this.leftX and this.rightX.\n\n393\n00:23:32.104 --> 00:23:39.545\nAnd then the boundary.width.\n\n394\n00:23:39.545 --> 00:23:44.152\nSo if I refresh, 100, 100, okay 330,\n\n395\n00:23:44.152 --> 00:23:48.870\n600 and then we come over here and\nit looks like,\n\n396\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:54.024\nif the right X which is the right X,\nso we start at the left\n\n397\n00:23:54.024 --> 00:23:58.769\nhand of that last attacker,\nand we add one, okay.\n\n398\n00:23:58.769 --> 00:24:03.487\nThe boundary width is 600, this is 330.\n\n399\n00:24:03.487 --> 00:24:05.325\nYou know what?\n\n400\n00:24:05.325 --> 00:24:08.710\nThe right and\nleft X are always going to be changing.\n\n401\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.819\nRight, because they're the relative\nto the containing portion.\n\n402\n00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:16.011\nSo that's something.\n\n403\n00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:17.124\n&gt;&gt; Flux.\n\n404\n00:24:17.124 --> 00:24:21.936\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhat we want to do is grab effectively,\n\n405\n00:24:21.936 --> 00:24:25.850\nlet's change this up a little bit.\n\n406\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:32.730\nLet's say this.attackers,\nlet me grab the first one.\n\n407\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.548\nSo it's the first attacker.\n\n408\n00:24:35.548 --> 00:24:41.150\nSo const firstAttacker and\n\n409\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.160\nthat should grab the first one for\nme and as a result,\n\n410\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.790\nI should be able to get this\nout of here and this.attackers.\n\n411\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.300\nSo, I should get the first and\nthe last and what that means,\n\n412\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:25:00.870\nis I want the firstAttacker.x plus or\nno, just the firstAttacker.x.\n\n413\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.420\nSo, that's the left x and\nthat's the right x respectively.\n\n414\n00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.900\nAs a result, every time I move,\nI need to reevaluate this.\n\n415\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:14.100\nSo I need to grab that,\nit's initially set,\n\n416\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.260\nand I'm just gonna copy and\npaste just to make sure that works.\n\n417\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.635\nAnd we if come come back over here and\nwe refresh, oh-oh,\n\n418\n00:25:19.635 --> 00:25:21.730\nfirst attacker is not defined.\n\n419\n00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.280\nWhy is that?\n\n420\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.920\nBecause, I\n\n421\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.370\nactually need to do this\nportion every time as well.\n\n422\n00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.340\nHmm.\n\n423\n00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.710\nI don't know.\n\n424\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.810\nHmm, we could possibly figure\nout a way around that.\n\n425\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.540\nBut, there we go.\n\n426\n00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:48.350\nIf I refresh, and\nnotice these numbers are moving, boom.\n\n427\n00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.980\nOkay, so now, now we have that.\n\n428\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.010\nWe're good on that.\n\n429\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.640\nLet's remove that console.log,\ncuz there's a lot of numbers.\n\n430\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.903\nSo what happened was, this left x and\nright x are now are being updated\n\n431\n00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:01.620\neverytime the entire swarm moves\n&gt;&gt; Who?\n\n432\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.220\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that\nwe have to reverse and\n\n433\n00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.940\ngrab parts of the attackers every\ntime in order to update that.\n\n434\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.220\nI don't know how I feel about that,\nbut that's all right.\n\n435\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.360\nWe're just going with what we already had.\n\n436\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.330\nReally, what I'd probably do is,\nif I move, then how much ever I move\n\n437\n00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.840\nan attacker, I would actually\nmove those points back and forth.\n\n438\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.620\nBut, we're good.\n\n439\n00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.320\nWe can just used the attackers to do that.\n\n440\n00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.560\nAnd I could pull this out into another\nfunction as like compute boundary.\n\n441\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.870\nAnd that'll give me an x and y or\nthe left and the right back.\n\n442\n00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.610\nWe'll just leave it there.\n\n443\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.830\nBut now we gotta test.\n\n444\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.210\nAll right, so I shot out a middle one,\nboom, it drops down.\n\n445\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.530\nAnd then, let me shoot out this one.\n\n446\n00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.250\nAnd then, we know the left is\nstill gonna hit at the same time.\n\n447\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.806\nBut now if they come over, and\n\n448\n00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:59.189\n[SOUND] what happened there?\n\n449\n00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:05.750\nHmm, so we've actually run into\nthe exactly the same problem that we had.\n\n450\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n451\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.260\n&gt;&gt; And why is that?\n\n452\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.110\nBecause the last attacker\nis now being peeled\n\n453\n00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.820\noff\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n454\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:19.468\n&gt;&gt; Every time, so, wait, we've, we've\ngot into a little bit of trouble, right?\n\n455\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.600\nWe need to set regular boundaries, and\nthen come back and check just those.\n\n456\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.510\n&gt;&gt; It looks like we're\nback where we started.\n\n457\n00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.780\nDoes that means we are relying on the\nattackers for the left and right bounce?\n\n458\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.730\n&gt;&gt; I think you're on to something.\n\n459\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.440\nWe definitely were trying to avoid this.\n\n460\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those where\n\n461\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.330\nyou're like, this'll make sense,\n\n462\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.580\nand then you remember,\nthat's kind of what we were already doing.\n\n463\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.140\nBut there's nothing wrong with that,\nbecause we know that the swarm itself\n\n464\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.400\nstill maintains the same\nbehavior that we originally had.\n\n465\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.350\nThat's not what we wanted,\nwe wanted fixed bounds.\n\n466\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.910\nNow, what I mean by fixed is\nthe width is initially fixed, right?\n\n467\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.180\nThe boundary, the left and right.\n\n468\n00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:04.960\nHowever, that doesn’t mean the position\nof that boundary is fixed because\n\n469\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.160\nwhat I'm thinking is that, I've missed and\nintentionally whoopsy-daisy, the attackers\n\n470\n00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.300\nare moving but that means that the\nbounding box also has to move with them\n\n471\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.916\nbecause it can only be established\nonce there's a full slot of attackers.\n\n472\n00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:21.270\nWe can automatically, [INAUDIBLE] cuz\nwhat it will do is the bounding box will\n\n473\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.890\nshrink, just like we saw it doesn't\nbehave like we anticipated.\n\n474\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.450\nSo I think there's a few fixes and\nwhat that means is now the attackers\n\n475\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:36.210\nwill have some simulated kind of similar\ncode in the attacker and the swarm itself.\n\n476\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.220\nWe're going to leave that be so\nwe don't have to get too down and dirty.\n\n477\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n478\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to the fix it, we always have\nthe bounding box fixed regardless of how\n\n479\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.280\nmany attackers that we have.\n\n480\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.090\nSo if we come back and\n\n481\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.975\nlook at my screen, I made this way more\ncomplicated than it probably needed to be.\n\n482\n00:28:48.975 --> 00:28:52.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING]\n&gt;&gt; So, let's get rid of this,\n\n483\n00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.830\nlet's just start over.\n\n484\n00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.480\nI'm big on starting over.\n\n485\n00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.583\nLet's just get rid of all of that.\n\n486\n00:28:56.583 --> 00:29:02.098\nLet's say, this.x equals x, okay?\n\n487\n00:29:02.098 --> 00:29:07.050\nNow, what we need is to\ngrant the lastattacker,\n\n488\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.920\nand you'll see why in just a moment.\n\n489\n00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.973\nI think this is gonna work.\n\n490\n00:29:10.973 --> 00:29:17.329\nSo this this.attackers then,\nthat was weird, this.attackers.reverse and\n\n491\n00:29:17.329 --> 00:29:21.908\nthat should give me the last\none because I reversed them and\n\n492\n00:29:21.908 --> 00:29:25.560\nI grabbed the first one\nfrom the reversed one.\n\n493\n00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.190\nBut now I want to calculate a width.\n\n494\n00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.830\nWhy do I want a width?\n\n495\n00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:37.220\nBecause if i know how this one moves then\ni know that the other one is always this\n\n496\n00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.770\namount, I can just add or subtract,\nI don't have to do array operations,\n\n497\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.650\nwhich is gonna be faster, and\nI can also kind of set those in stone.\n\n498\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.070\nHow do I calculate the width?\n\n499\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:52.110\nWell, I want the last attacker's x\nwhen we first created, minus this x.\n\n500\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.600\nNow, I could have used x from\nthe constructor function right here,\n\n501\n00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.900\nbut they're essentially\nthe same value at this time.\n\n502\n00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.530\nIn addition to, if I know the bounding\nbox the swarm as a whole has to move.\n\n503\n00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:10.960\nIf it has to move, well, then I need\na velocity, and I'm gonna use one.\n\n504\n00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.970\nNow, I think, let me go check, there's\none, I'm gonna use the exact same one.\n\n505\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:21.040\nNow what I could do is refactor\nthe attacker to take an amount, and\n\n506\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.150\nthen the swarm passes that amount so\neverything still moves together.\n\n507\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.430\nBut we're just going to leave it be for\nnow, so I think that's good.\n\n508\n00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.730\nBut what that means is I now have to,\n\n509\n00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:37.140\nwhen I drop down, I need to reverse\nthe direction that everything is moving.\n\n510\n00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.169\nSo I'm going to say, this.dx = -1,\n\n511\n00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:47.355\nwhich is exactly the same\nas this.dx x= -1 x this.dx.\n\n512\n00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:52.950\nAnd then lastly, this move,\nwe don't need any of that.\n\n513\n00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.021\nI said lastly, there's actually two\nmore things I think we need to fix,\n\n514\n00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:59.846\nI just saw the other one,\nthis.x +=this.dx.\n\n515\n00:30:59.846 --> 00:31:04.790\nOkay, so all the attackers are moving but\nalso the bounding box is moving.\n\n516\n00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.320\nAnd they're moving in unison.\n\n517\n00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.295\nThey're a swarm.\n\n518\n00:31:07.295 --> 00:31:07.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n\n519\n00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.470\n&gt;&gt; And then this his edge.\n\n520\n00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.150\nWe don't have a left and right anymore.\n\n521\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.653\nSince x is moving, this.x,\nif it's less than or\n\n522\n00:31:19.653 --> 00:31:25.319\nequal to zero, or\nthis.x plus the width is less than or\n\n523\n00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:32.710\nequal, excuse me, greater than or\nequal than the boundary's width,\n\n524\n00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:37.540\nwhich is essentially\nthe right hand portion.\n\n525\n00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.040\nAll right, if we come back and\n\n526\n00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.710\nlook at the attacker, That kinda\nlooks exactly the same, does it not?\n\n527\n00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:51.563\nSo the hitsEdge, we really should pull\nthat up, we're not going to for now.\n\n528\n00:31:51.563 --> 00:31:55.069\nAnd then the move, we could actually\nchange that a little bit so\n\n529\n00:31:55.069 --> 00:31:58.321\nyou have this composition of\nobjects inside of the swarm.\n\n530\n00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:00.858\nOkay, so if we come here And,\n\n531\n00:32:00.858 --> 00:32:05.842\nI think that might get us\nthe behavior we're looking for.\n\n532\n00:32:05.842 --> 00:32:10.645\nSo if I refresh, let's see,\ndoes it, it hit?\n\n533\n00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:15.662\nUh-oh, we got a little overrun,\nand why is that?\n\n534\n00:32:15.662 --> 00:32:20.885\nWell, the this.x + width.\n\n535\n00:32:20.885 --> 00:32:25.270\nAnd actually, it's not that out,\nit's this left one.\n\n536\n00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.270\nSo it only counts up to that point, and\n\n537\n00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.920\nthat's because we're using the upper left\nhand corner, so we actually need to add\n\n538\n00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.700\non to the width a little bit and I think\nthat would fix it, so what is width?\n\n539\n00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:42.359\nWell, it's + lastAttacker.width, okay,\nand that way the attacker determines,\n\n540\n00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:46.120\nthe width of the attacker\ndetermines the overall width.\n\n541\n00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:52.200\nSo, boom, let's see if we get the right,\nand boop, there we go.\n\n542\n00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.240\nLet's see if we get the left,\nwait for it, wait for it, boop.\n\n543\n00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.540\nAnd let's see if we knock off\nthe edge here, ain't gonna make it.\n\n544\n00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.750\nSo let's, I ain't going to\nmake it on this one either.\n\n545\n00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.160\nThere we go, let's just.\n\n546\n00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.783\nAll right,\n\n547\n00:33:09.783 --> 00:33:13.841\nso we know that the left that works,\nbecause that's the original attacker.\n\n548\n00:33:13.841 --> 00:33:16.750\nWhat we should see,\nis this drop down before it go up.\n\n549\n00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.260\nAnd it does,\nit keeps the initial bounding box, so\n\n550\n00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.870\nnow it's always traveling the same path.\n\n551\n00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.190\nIn the same distance across.\n\n552\n00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.999\nSo, we've done what we've set out to do.\n\n553\n00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:27.255\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n554\n00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.459\n&gt;&gt; And if we look,\n\n555\n00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:33.472\nwe do have some duplicative code\nfrom the attacker to the swarm.\n\n556\n00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:35.130\nAnd we could change that out.\n\n557\n00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.970\nLike this attacker.dropDown,\nthat should probably stay, because\n\n558\n00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.999\nas the entire swarm drops down, every\nindividual attacker needs to drop down.\n\n559\n00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:48.160\nBut, we also have this DX, right,\n\n560\n00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.780\nthat, in drop-down,\nthat's being changed for each hacker.\n\n561\n00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.390\nOkay, that does provide us with some\nflexibility, because, what if we want our\n\n562\n00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:59.330\nswarm where the hackers are actually\nmoving independently of each other.\n\n563\n00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.902\nSo we may still need that, so\nthat's why I'm not worried.\n\n564\n00:34:01.902 --> 00:34:08.040\nAnd then, the move of the swarm, well, we\nhave some duplicated code there as well.\n\n565\n00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.920\nSo we could change this to move,\nbased on the swarm amount.\n\n566\n00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.500\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n567\n00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.038\nWe could do some additional refactoring,\nbut\n\n568\n00:34:18.038 --> 00:34:22.526\nI wanna hold off on that before we get too\ndeep, mainly, because we may find that,\n\n569\n00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:25.931\nthere's some other changes that\nneed to be made or maybe not.\n\n570\n00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:29.812\nWe can always come back and do this later,\nlet's not get too crazy there,\n\n571\n00:34:29.812 --> 00:34:33.503\nwe've already, I think done enough\nto make to make it more readable,\n\n572\n00:34:33.503 --> 00:34:36.770\na little easier to keep\nthe swarm collectively together.\n\n573\n00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.580\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin, thank you for\nleaving no stone unturned.\n\n574\n00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.500\nCreating the Swarm part 2,\nthere is a part 1, watch them both,\n\n575\n00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.170\nyou'll enjoy, Justin, I know you have\nsomething else to say, I can tell.\n\n576\n00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know I'm looking at this and,\nit's all nice and\n\n577\n00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.860\ngood that we have the squares,\nright, and the little rectangles.\n\n578\n00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.200\nIt would almost be better if\nwe had sprites, actual images.\n\n579\n00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.572\nSo I'm thinking, since we have\nour initial kind of game logic,\n\n580\n00:35:02.572 --> 00:35:06.272\nnow would be a good time to,\nmaybe I can add sprites, because, right,\n\n581\n00:35:06.272 --> 00:35:08.269\nI can determine whether I win or lose.\n\n582\n00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:11.250\nWe could always come back and\nadd win or lose conditions.\n\n583\n00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.440\nBut I would like to have images.\n\n584\n00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.890\nWhich does add a complicating factor,\n\n585\n00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.000\nbecause images have to\nload asynchronously.\n\n586\n00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.431\nBut I think now's the time before we\nget to far down the path to come and\n\n587\n00:35:24.431 --> 00:35:27.670\nadd images with the attackers,\nimages for the fighter.\n\n588\n00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.583\nWe'll probably keep the pellets the same,\n\n589\n00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:32.385\nbecause they kind of look like\npellets without having an image.\n\n590\n00:35:32.385 --> 00:35:33.788\nThey're pretty small to have an image.\n\n591\n00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:37.107\nSo definitely stay tuned,\nI think sprites are in our future.\n\n592\n00:35:37.107 --> 00:35:39.741\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAnd you'll want to stay with us as we\n\n593\n00:35:39.741 --> 00:35:44.805\ncontinue with and all the wonderful\nepisodes of HTML 5 canvas projects.\n\n594\n00:35:44.805 --> 00:35:46.242\nJustin does a wonderful job.\n\n595\n00:35:46.242 --> 00:35:49.660\nYou can enjoy them, and\nyou can also apply them.\n\n596\n00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.190\nVirtually anything you want to do.\n\n597\n00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.300\nAnd go check out our course library.\n\n598\n00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.480\nThere's so many episodes,\nthere are so many videos, and\n\n599\n00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.880\nthey are all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n600\n00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.400\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDEV Pro TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n601\n00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.790\nThanks for watching, I'm Jack Nemis.\n\n602\n00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.511\n&gt;&gt;

Well, before we get to what it means-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:34.774\n&gt;&gt; I need to make sure that you're\n\n10\n00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:35.295\nokay, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.974\nYou seemed a little amped\nup about the sprite thing.\n\n12\n00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:39.669\n&gt;&gt; I am, I'm amped.\nI'm really amped because as we go\n\n13\n00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:41.056\nforward with that mo attack.\n\n14\n00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:45.856\nAnd your homage to space invaders, I'm\nreally excited to see what sprites are,\n\n15\n00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:47.277\nwell what are sprites?\n\n16\n00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:51.844\n&gt;&gt; Well luckily for us, there is\ngonna be no licensing issues per se.\n\n17\n00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:57.336\nIt is not the carbonated lemon lime\nbeverage that possibly you're thinking of.\n\n18\n00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:01.273\nIt's instead, the visual or\ngraphical representation.\n\n19\n00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:02.741\nNow what do I mean we're adding sprite?\n\n20\n00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:07.753\nWe kinda one could make an argument\nthat we already have sprites\n\n21\n00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:12.776\nthat represent our attackers and\nour pellets and our fighter.\n\n22\n00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:17.607\nBut it's just squares and rectangles-\n&gt;&gt; It would be kind of cool if we kne,\n\n23\n00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:21.776\nthere's our little fighter and\nthere's our attackers.\n\n24\n00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:22.351\nAnd what's on the image?\n\n25\n00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.043\nEssentially, a sprite is a stand in for\n\n26\n00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.296\nthis bounded box entity that is\nrendered to the page, right?\n\n27\n00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.778\nSo a sprite is an image for\nthis rendered entity.\n\n28\n00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:38.315\n&gt;&gt; So is this something we're gonna\nhave to rework code to achieve?\n\n29\n00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:42.062\n&gt;&gt; Well we're gonna try to do it as\nminimally as possible to see if any\n\n30\n00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:43.230\npatterns fall out.\n\n31\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.147\nBut we may find that we have no choice,\nbut to do a fair amount of reworking,\n\n32\n00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:48.788\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n33\n00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:52.884\n&gt;&gt; With that said, I think what I'm going\nto do is attack the attacker first as\n\n34\n00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:54.324\nfar as adding the sprite.\n\n35\n00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:57.815\nWe're gonna hold off and\nfocus on one thing at a time,\n\n36\n00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:00.695\nthat way we don't have any issues, right?\n\n37\n00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.189\nSo go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n38\n00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.693\nAnd now we left off from\na previous episode, there we go.\n\n39\n00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:12.568\nWe have all of this wonderful movement and\n\n40\n00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:17.033\nour swarm works and our pellets work.\n\n41\n00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:20.021\nAnd if we look at AtmoAttack\nwhich is our app.\n\n42\n00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:24.812\nWe've cleaned that up by abstracting our\nswarm of invaders into a swarm object.\n\n43\n00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:28.555\nWe still have pellets, but that's fine.\n\n44\n00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:32.862\nOkay, now if I look here\nI create the fighter.\n\n45\n00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:36.000\nAnd I look at the fighter, and\nI've created a red fighter.\n\n46\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.250\nNow what I'm thinking is\nif we look at the fighter\n\n47\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.510\nthis color purple, instead of having\na color, we could just assign it a sprite.\n\n48\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.113\nNow I'm not saying this is\nnecessarily the best way, but\n\n49\n00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:54.786\nkind of keep minimal moving parts from\nhaving to change a bunch of things.\n\n50\n00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:58.054\nI think that'll be our first good attempt,\nbut\n\n51\n00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:02.400\nwhat that does mean is our\nrender function has to change.\n\n52\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.325\n&gt;&gt; So already we're gonna have\nto make some differences,\n\n53\n00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:06.889\nsome change out some things.\n\n54\n00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:14.267\nNow with that, I've actually pulled in\na couple of images for this episode.\n\n55\n00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:16.456\nNow I drew these,\nI just kind of painted them out.\n\n56\n00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:19.610\nThey are SVGs which stands for\nScalable Vector Graphics.\n\n57\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.841\nIf you know that possible entities\ncan be bigger or smaller or what not.\n\n58\n00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:28.854\nYou're gonna get a little bit better\nkind of not necessarily performance,\n\n59\n00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:31.030\nbut if I make an SVG really big.\n\n60\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.080\nIt may still be pixellated because we\ncreate bitmap images on the canvas.\n\n61\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.345\nBut it's not gonna be pixellated\nbecause you're stretching out\n\n62\n00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.214\nthe original information.\n\n63\n00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:43.749\nThe attacker and the fighter,\n\n64\n00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.826\nwell let me see if I can just\nshow you these respective things.\n\n65\n00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.906\nSo I'm gonna grab this file path and\n\n66\n00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:55.666\nshow you images, and here's attacker,\n\n67\n00:03:55.666 --> 00:04:00.430\nand it is absolutely teeny tiny, right?\n\n68\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.503\nSo there it is, that's the default render.\n\n69\n00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:09.705\nAnd if I zoom this in for\nthis page, that's 500%.\n\n70\n00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:10.479\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n71\n00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:16.416\n&gt;&gt; I can actually scale SVGs by drawing\nthem to the canvas based on the width and\n\n72\n00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:18.215\nheight of what I need.\n\n73\n00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:22.617\nSo here's our little attacker and\nyes, it is a little grainy there.\n\n74\n00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:26.635\nBut that's because we're actually\nrendering this to a standard image type.\n\n75\n00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:29.278\n&gt;&gt; Looks like an evil raisin.\n\n76\n00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:30.041\n&gt;&gt; You know what Zack?\n\n77\n00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.165\nThat's the look I was going for, right?\n\n78\n00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:34.622\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kinda dried up grapes with kinda\n\n79\n00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:38.700\ntentacles going, I'm gonna get you,\nI'm gonna get you.\n\n80\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.615\nAnd here's our fighter, I never claim,\nif I spell fighter right.\n\n81\n00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.468\nI never claimed to be a graphic designer.\n\n82\n00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:48.956\nSo there we go, if we come back and look,\n\n83\n00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.342\nour fighter is just kind of a little tank,\nso to speak.\n\n84\n00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:54.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tank, yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:54.414 --> 00:04:57.768\n&gt;&gt; It's more of a house with a chimney and\nwheels, but\n\n86\n00:04:57.768 --> 00:05:00.734\nwe're gonna go with tank for\nthis argument.\n\n87\n00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.249\nThose are our two images.\n\n88\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.172\nI haven't included these, because you\nshould probably figure out well maybe\n\n89\n00:05:08.172 --> 00:05:12.299\nit'll be funny to have my head as the tank\nor as the invaders, you could go wild.\n\n90\n00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:12.827\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n91\n00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:17.243\n&gt;&gt; And I want to go to say use\nwhatever your creative kind of\n\n92\n00:05:17.243 --> 00:05:19.932\ninklings are to pick the images.\n\n93\n00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:22.619\nI wanted to learn a little more about\nvector graphics, so I built my own.\n\n94\n00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:26.479\nThis took an exorbitant amount time\ncomparatively to what someone who knew\n\n95\n00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.642\nwhat they were doing,\n\n96\n00:05:27.642 --> 00:05:28.991\nwould be able to [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.257\n&gt;&gt; Knock them out, but\n\n98\n00:05:30.257 --> 00:05:34.889\nthis is what I wanted, but if you\nwanted something like an actual raisin.\n\n99\n00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.175\nOr maybe you remember\nthe California raisins?\n\n100\n00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:38.088\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n101\n00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.587\n&gt;&gt; The dancing raisins?\n\n102\n00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:41.649\nI don't know what happened.\n\n103\n00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:44.914\nWe probably should have kept that\noff of zag there, with that dancing.\n\n104\n00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:46.932\nNo, no, I'm joking.\n\n105\n00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:48.193\nWe all like to dance.\n\n106\n00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:48.926\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n107\n00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:52.172\nuse your own kind of creative impetus,\nright?\n\n108\n00:05:52.172 --> 00:05:55.188\nWhat do I want my invaders to be or\nmy attackers to be?\n\n109\n00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:55.932\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n110\n00:05:55.932 --> 00:05:58.063\n&gt;&gt; And the fighter, so on and so forth.\n\n111\n00:05:58.063 --> 00:06:00.376\nSo those are our two images, and\nI didn't open those two up in Atom.\n\n112\n00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:04.342\nBecause SVGs under the hood,\nare actually just a bunch of text,\n\n113\n00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:05.889\ninterestingly enough.\n\n114\n00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.408\nThey-\n&gt;&gt; Somehow, I knew they would be.\n\n115\n00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthey build these individual pieces,\n\n116\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.660\npaths and shapes based on math, right?\n\n117\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.607\nAnd they just represent that as text.\n\n118\n00:06:20.607 --> 00:06:24.725\nWe're not here to talk a great deal\nabout SVGs, but now that we have those.\n\n119\n00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:29.799\nWe should be able to create an image and\nassociate it with an attacker or\n\n120\n00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:32.816\nexcuse me, not an attacker, a fighter.\n\n121\n00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:34.251\nI'm getting all wound up here-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n122\n00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.308\n&gt;&gt; So here's our fighter.\n\n123\n00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:37.736\nI think I actually showed\nthe attacker when I was talking about\n\n124\n00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:38.632\nthe fighter earlier.\n\n125\n00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:42.172\nBut ultimately as Zach has\npointed out in previous episodes,\n\n126\n00:06:42.172 --> 00:06:47.156\nthey're really similar at current time,\nother than a few little individual pieces.\n\n127\n00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:55.011\nSo here's our fighter, I would really like\nto pass in sprite as an argument, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:59.982\nNow I no longer have the ability\nto have a default argument here,\n\n129\n00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:03.029\nbecause I kind of need to have an image.\n\n130\n00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:08.829\nSo I'm gonna have to pass that in and\nI'm going to remove the color\n\n131\n00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:14.004\nhere to see if I can get this\nall working so to speak, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:16.207\nSo how do I pass in this sprite?\n\n133\n00:07:16.207 --> 00:07:19.668\nWell I think the sprite\nshould be an image.\n\n134\n00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:25.759\nSo with that being an image,\nI need to create an image.\n\n135\n00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.134\nI need to load the image,\nand then pass it in.\n\n136\n00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:30.416\nSo I come over here to our app.js,\n\n137\n00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:34.054\nthat would be necessary\nbefore this fighter portion.\n\n138\n00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:38.542\nSo let's say fighter sprite,\n\n139\n00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:43.553\njust for clarity, is a new image.\n\n140\n00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:47.467\nAnd I cannot spell\nfighter to save my life.\n\n141\n00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.323\n&gt;&gt; It has an F in it.\n\n142\n00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:52.021\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does, it does and\nit also has a G, a H, and\n\n143\n00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:55.903\na T in an appropriate order\nthat I somehow cannot get.\n\n144\n00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:58.505\n&gt;&gt; He knows more than me.\n\n145\n00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:06.128\n&gt;&gt; So our fighter sprite source is, So\nour at dot JS is inside of this folder.\n\n146\n00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:11.254\nRight here inside of, excuse me at the top\nlevel is not inside of the folder.\n\n147\n00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:17.026\nSo we wanna go into the images folder and\ngrab the fighter.svg, okay.\n\n148\n00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:22.619\nSo, images, fighter.svg Just like so\n\n149\n00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:26.897\nand well, there is our image.\n\n150\n00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:31.982\nWe should be able to pass that in as\nthe sprite instead of this color and\n\n151\n00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:33.570\nsay fighter sprite.\n\n152\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.679\nAnd I'm actually going to break these,\napparently delete that,\n\n153\n00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.204\nbreak these into new lines so\nwe don't have to get crazy.\n\n154\n00:08:42.204 --> 00:08:44.890\nOver scroll there from left to right.\n\n155\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.365\nSo there we go, our fighter is now\nconstructed a little bit differently.\n\n156\n00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:48.899\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n157\n00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:52.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, since we have this bundled\nup, we should be able to go look at it.\n\n158\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.140\nLet's go refresh, and\n\n159\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.504\nnotice this went back to black\nbecause I haven't changed my render.\n\n160\n00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:58.293\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n161\n00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:03.885\nBut if we look at the game,\nI have to remember what my game is,\n\n162\n00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:08.400\nif I scroll down here,\nI actually called again.\n\n163\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.760\nI should have just went with my gut.\n\n164\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.050\n&gt;&gt; That was clever.\n&gt;&gt; There we go, it's the fighter.\n\n165\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.627\nAnd I look,\nnotice sprite is an image object,\n\n166\n00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:22.949\nI should be able to render\nthat drawImage to the screen.\n\n167\n00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:29.600\nOkay,sSo if I come back,\nI now need to change the fighters render.\n\n168\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.095\nFillStyle no longer applicable.\n\n169\n00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:39.895\nThis.x, this.y, that's fine,\nbut we need drawImage and\n\n170\n00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:45.035\nI think width and\nheight are still necessary.\n\n171\n00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:45.787\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:09:45.787 --> 00:09:51.980\n&gt;&gt; But\nwe need to say this .sprite so, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:58.576\nSo now if we come back, there's our little\nfighter, except he's kinda been squished.\n\n174\n00:09:58.576 --> 00:09:59.288\n&gt;&gt; He's squished.\n\n175\n00:09:59.288 --> 00:09:59.822\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n176\n00:09:59.822 --> 00:10:01.363\nSo those original width and height.\n\n177\n00:10:01.363 --> 00:10:04.793\nI put those in there to like a rectangle,\nbut\n\n178\n00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:08.980\nmaybe I don't need those width and\nheights anymore.\n\n179\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.201\nSo let's go tweak that around.\n\n180\n00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:12.031\nLet's get rid of this.\n\n181\n00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:19.460\nAs far as rendering and hmm,\nI think I just need to change something.\n\n182\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.717\nLet's keep them and\nlet's go with 48 by 48.\n\n183\n00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:27.987\nI think I actually drew that.\n\n184\n00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:30.090\nThat's a little better, a little better.\n\n185\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.858\n&gt;&gt; Not bad.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna scale this down\n\n186\n00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:37.027\njust a wee bit, 32, there we go,\nI think that's a good kind of medium,\n\n187\n00:10:37.027 --> 00:10:40.680\nit's kind of small,\nmaybe make it a little bit bigger.\n\n188\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.085\nBut, I have a 32 pixel\nby 32 pixel sprite now.\n\n189\n00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:48.600\nMy question is,\ndoes everything else still work?\n\n190\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.058\nAnd, look,\nit now looks like I have a little, Little\n\n191\n00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:57.680\nfighter running around,\nand is, I got it, run.\n\n192\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.299\n&gt;&gt; You get fire.\n\n193\n00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:01.273\nGood.\n&gt;&gt; So, everything else still works, and\n\n194\n00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:02.550\nthen that is handy.\n\n195\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:10.158\nNow Zach, I'm gonna ask you a question and\nmaybe you have some insight on this.\n\n196\n00:11:10.158 --> 00:11:15.870\nThis images stuff, you've been with me\nthrough a lot of these html canvas ones.\n\n197\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.582\nThis creating a new image and\nthen adding the source,\n\n198\n00:11:19.582 --> 00:11:23.474\ndo you remember us possibly\nhaving problems with that?\n\n199\n00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.003\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you a question.\n\n200\n00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:27.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To your question with another question.\n\n201\n00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:32.114\nIs it gonna be harder to\nrender the attackers to create\n\n202\n00:11:32.114 --> 00:11:36.180\nthem because there's multiples of them?\n\n203\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.481\n&gt;&gt; I mean these are ultimately,\nI think, intertwined.\n\n204\n00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:44.660\nSo the issue that I asked Zach about\nthe image can load asynchronously.\n\n205\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.529\nIt is possible that it would not be\nready to render on first render.\n\n206\n00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:51.524\nLikewise, if it's asynchronous loading,\n\n207\n00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:55.870\na bunch of attackers may have\ndifficulties being ready, right?\n\n208\n00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.564\nSo I need to load the image and\nI sign in through the attackers.\n\n209\n00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:02.450\nSo I think those are intimately\nintertwined, Zach.\n\n210\n00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.170\n&gt;&gt; I did not use an onload\nevent listener here.\n\n211\n00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.639\nWell that's kind of weird.\n\n212\n00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Should you have used\nan onload event listener?\n\n213\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.191\n&gt;&gt; I probably should have.\n\n214\n00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:16.976\nI got away with it because these\nimages are actually really solid.\n\n215\n00:12:16.976 --> 00:12:20.326\nWe saw one when they rendered in\nthe In the browser, teeny tiny,\n\n216\n00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:24.123\nthere's just a little bit of text and\nwhich means they load really fast.\n\n217\n00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:26.690\nIt's usually ready to render.\n\n218\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.280\nThere's no guarantee that's the case.\n\n219\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.750\nLikewise, I should almost before\nI can construct the game.\n\n220\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.857\nI should have the images ready, I think.\n\n221\n00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:41.795\nI think that's probably better,\nlet me go ahead and load all these images,\n\n222\n00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:45.920\nand now, construct the game,\nand start the game off.\n\n223\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.590\nBut what that means is that we do have\nto make a few little changes here.\n\n224\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.470\nOur app.js is now going to\nneed to handle asynchronicity.\n\n225\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.003\nThere is no like top to bottom execution.\n\n226\n00:12:57.003 --> 00:12:58.667\n&gt;&gt; So there's going to be a little bit\nof reverse engineering going on here?\n\n227\n00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:00.542\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, a little bit.\n\n228\n00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:04.967\nAnd actually, if you haven't checked\nout some of my other projects in\n\n229\n00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:06.151\nHTML5 Canvas-\n&gt;&gt; You should.\n\n230\n00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:09.098\n&gt;&gt; You should definitely go check those\nout because I've talked about loading\n\n231\n00:13:09.098 --> 00:13:10.370\nimages asynchronously.\n\n232\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.259\n&gt;&gt; And I've shown a few things that I'm\ngonna utilize in this project that I\n\n233\n00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:14.906\ngot lucky.\n\n234\n00:13:14.906 --> 00:13:19.590\nI do wanna emphasize, I got lucky\nwith the image kind of rendering.\n\n235\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.495\n&gt;&gt; Or did he?\n\n236\n00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:21.065\n&gt;&gt; No, I did.\n\n237\n00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:24.510\nI have loaded very large\nimages this way and\n\n238\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.260\nsometimes it goes, nope,\nnothing, got nothing.\n\n239\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.600\nSo, if we come back to the screen here,\n\n240\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.990\nwe should probably change\na few things around.\n\n241\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.958\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Number one.\n\n242\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.139\nI'm thinking, that, so we can see\nthe clear delineation between creating\n\n243\n00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:43.750\nthe game object, which is,\nAtmoAttack, right from the class.\n\n244\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.446\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n245\n00:13:44.446 --> 00:13:47.232\n&gt;&gt; And, the modification of, kind of,\n\n246\n00:13:47.232 --> 00:13:49.292\nAtmoAttack\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n247\n00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:51.165\nI'm gonna rearrange a little bit, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:56.925\nSo I'm going to create\na JavaScript file called\n\n249\n00:13:56.925 --> 00:14:02.630\ngain.js and, excuse me let, wait for it.\n\n250\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.549\nI'm gonna rename it main, not gain.\n\n251\n00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:11.640\nMain.js, so kind of our main thing.\n\n252\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.827\nAnd really I could call it AtmoAttack but\n\n253\n00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:17.767\nI don't want to confuse the name of\nthe project with the name of the file.\n\n254\n00:14:17.767 --> 00:14:18.369\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n255\n00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:20.740\n&gt;&gt; So I come into index.html I used to.\n\n256\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.597\nThis needs to be available before\nI can write my app.js, okay.\n\n257\n00:14:26.597 --> 00:14:31.092\nSo my app.js, I don't wanna pull this atmo\n\n258\n00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:36.072\nattack out because I'm\ngonna have to worry about\n\n259\n00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:40.725\nasynchronicity as far as the images, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:40.725 --> 00:14:42.063\n&gt;&gt; Uh-mm.\n\n261\n00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:46.799\n&gt;&gt; So, if I come down here and\nwait for it,\n\n262\n00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:52.410\nwait for\nit I come over to main.js there we go.\n\n263\n00:14:56.398 --> 00:14:59.800\nAnd no, it looks like it's tabbed over,\nbut it's not.\n\n264\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.912\nSo now, what I'm talking about is\nI need to load these images and\n\n265\n00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:04.905\nhave them available.\n\n266\n00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.253\n&gt;&gt; Right, makes sense.\n\n267\n00:15:06.253 --> 00:15:11.465\nBut instead, what I'm going to do\nis construct these objects and\n\n268\n00:15:11.465 --> 00:15:14.420\npass them into the AtmoAttack game.\n\n269\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.640\nSo I wanna construct these outside, make\nsure they're ready and then pass them in.\n\n270\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.940\nSo I have to change my AtmoAttack.\n\n271\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.342\nRight now, we just have a selector.\n\n272\n00:15:23.342 --> 00:15:26.159\nBut I really need a fighter and\na swarm, and\n\n273\n00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:29.610\nthen pass in the preconstructed\nfighter and swarm.\n\n274\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.439\nThat way I can make sure\nthat the images are ready.\n\n275\n00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:33.633\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe pellets will still be there too.\n\n276\n00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:36.807\n&gt;&gt; And the pellets will still be in\nturn because we haven't applied any\n\n277\n00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:37.870\nabstractions there.\n\n278\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.036\nSo those will stay inside of of AtmoAttack\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n279\n00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:43.804\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna say fighter.\n\n280\n00:15:43.804 --> 00:15:51.570\nAnd swarm like so, and\nI'm just gonna gram these portions.\n\n281\n00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.816\nCut those up, wait for it.\n\n282\n00:15:55.816 --> 00:15:58.023\nCut these and say, dis.fighter.\n\n283\n00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:03.207\nFighter equals fighter.\n\n284\n00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:05.517\nMaybe.\n\n285\n00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:07.748\nFighter.\n\n286\n00:16:07.748 --> 00:16:13.710\nAnd this.swarm = swarm.\n\n287\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.570\nNow what this means is I can\nconstruct this game, but\n\n288\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.840\nI have to pass in essentially the\ndependencies of the fighter and the swarm.\n\n289\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.720\nIf I come back to the game object,\ncuz if we look this is all kinds of broke.\n\n290\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.950\n[LAUGH] All kinds of broke.\n\n291\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.970\nIf we come back to our game object,\nif I paste these in and\n\n292\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.800\nI say, const fighter const\n\n293\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:46.350\nswarm and\nthen I pass in fighter and swarm.\n\n294\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.230\nI should get it back and there we go,\n\n295\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.590\nexcept notice, look at that,\nmy fighter hasn't loaded.\n\n296\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.520\n&gt;&gt; He's invisible.\n\n297\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.610\n&gt;&gt; But if we come back and\nwe look at the game, .fighter.\n\n298\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.150\nThere it is.\n\n299\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.198\nIt should be drawing.\n\n300\n00:17:04.198 --> 00:17:07.380\nBut I have inconsistencies because\nthere's no way that I'm guaranteeing\n\n301\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.290\nthat the file has loaded upon\nfirst render versus not.\n\n302\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.510\nAnd if I come over here and\n\n303\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.120\nI hit the arrow keys a few times, and\nI look back at the fighter, it is moving.\n\n304\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.802\nSo, this is where\nthe asynchronicity comes in.\n\n305\n00:17:23.802 --> 00:17:27.311\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What I would really like to do is load\n\n306\n00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:33.330\nthese sprites first and then pass\nthe sprites in to the next portion.\n\n307\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.737\nWhich creates a fighter based on\nthe sprite, creates a swarm based on the.\n\n308\n00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:41.118\nRight now the swarm's\nfine as we can see so\n\n309\n00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:45.142\nwe're gonna deal with the fighters\nfirst or the individual fighter.\n\n310\n00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:51.263\nAnd what that means we're gonna\nhave to do is this very interesting\n\n311\n00:17:51.263 --> 00:17:56.309\nkind of how do you say we\ngotta load some images, okay.\n\n312\n00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:01.495\nSo I'm gonna create a load\nimage function and image,\n\n313\n00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:06.010\nor I'm just gonna say, function loadImage.\n\n314\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:13.140\nAnd let's say, src and\nI'm gonna return a new promise.\n\n315\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:19.340\nNow, we've done this before, but\nthis is going to be a resolve, like so.\n\n316\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.279\nAnd now am going to grab this\npiece right here and say, boom,\n\n317\n00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:31.762\nimage, image, source and\n\n318\n00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:36.670\nthen image.onload.\n\n319\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.550\nNow I could use a add event listener here,\nbut I'm just gonna do an inline function,\n\n320\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.460\nonload, I want to resolve the image.\n\n321\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.756\nAnd that'll pass it back as a promise,\nand now I can say load image fighter,\n\n322\n00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:53.850\nload image, so on.\n\n323\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.590\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n&gt;&gt; And then, it'll be ready for\n\n324\n00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.980\nthe next step.\n\n325\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:04.508\nSo, we have this inside of here,\nand I'm gonna say, loadImage,\n\n326\n00:19:04.508 --> 00:19:10.128\nand then, *./images/fighter.svg*.\n\n327\n00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:17.560\n.then now that we have\nthe fighterSprite like that.\n\n328\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.560\nWe're going to run this next function.\n\n329\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.337\nWe're going to grab this piece right here.\n\n330\n00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:33.110\nThat's good, and we're also going\nto grab this piece right here.\n\n331\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.930\nBecause we can only start the game\nonce the fighter sprite is ready or\n\n332\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.925\nonce the fighter is.\n\n333\n00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.979\n&gt;&gt; And for some reason it likes\nto tab over ridiculous amounts.\n\n335\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.550\nWe should be good to go now.\n\n336\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.700\nLet's see.\n\n337\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.360\nAnd we still don't have any rendering.\n\n338\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.410\nWhy is that?\n\n339\n00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo we pass in the fighter.\n\n340\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.800\nI've got a little bit of debugging.\n\n341\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.305\nSo, there's our fighter.\n\n342\n00:19:58.305 --> 00:20:02.069\nAnd fighter.render.\n\n343\n00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:04.792\nAnd fighter.render this.sprite.\n\n344\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:13.360\nOkay, and let's make sure That I've saved,\nnumber one.\n\n345\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.703\nI have.\n\n346\n00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:19.590\nAnd then if we look at the fighterSprite,\nwe should say console.log\n\n347\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.490\nfighterSprite, a little bit of\nlive action debugging here, Zack.\n\n348\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.660\n&gt;&gt; That's good, I like it.\n\n349\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.330\nTeachable moments.\n\n350\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.520\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n351\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.227\nHave I, I'm making sure I didn't\nmisspell the source word.\n\n352\n00:20:35.227 --> 00:20:36.598\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Still invisible!\n\n353\n00:20:36.598 --> 00:20:43.171\n&gt;&gt; And there, there, and okay.\n\n354\n00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:45.740\nSo if I say\n\n355\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:55.740\ndocument.body.appendChild(fighterSprite\n\n356\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.260\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n357\n00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.660\nSo, it's loading.\n\n358\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.120\nSo, why isn't it rendering now?\n\n359\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.240\nHm, screen width, screen height.\n\n360\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Listen, this problem started happening\nwhen we pulled it out of the game object.\n\n361\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.410\nDoes that have anything to do with it?\n\n362\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.440\n&gt;&gt; You know what, Zack,\nyou might be on to something.\n\n363\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.125\nWe should probably check that,\nbecause I'm sure there's some oversight.\n\n364\n00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:24.370\nThat some of you are like, it's right\nthere, it's right there, I see it.\n\n365\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.220\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look back\nat the screen here, and, you know what?\n\n366\n00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:33.360\nThis.screen doesn't exist,\nyou're exactly correct.\n\n367\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:39.760\nSo, I don't have a screen, I actually\nneed to possibly do a little bit of\n\n368\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.050\nrefactoring because I need to bundle these\nup and then let the game only have logic.\n\n369\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:49.340\nI'm passing them to entities that I need.\n\n370\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.580\nLet's actually do that.\n\n371\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.550\nHere, if we look.\n\n372\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.670\nWait for it, wait for it, aha.\n\n373\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.220\nThe screen is document.query selector.\n\n374\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.312\nSo, there's our selector,\ndocumant.query selector.\n\n375\n00:22:05.312 --> 00:22:10.708\nWe really don't need that, this would\nbe probably be better left as screen.\n\n376\n00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:14.330\nAnd then take away the selector.\n\n377\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:21.090\nGrab this, say screen, and\nwe've pulled that out a little bit,\n\n378\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:27.190\nand we can pull this back over to app.js\nand I can say no longer selector but\n\n379\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:32.150\ninstead screen = and what was that?\n\n380\n00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.511\nWell it was double quotes,\nscreen which is a canvas object.\n\n381\n00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:40.100\nAnd I can't use screen,\nI forgot about that.\n\n382\n00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.210\nLet's see,\nlet's call it gamescreen in this case.\n\n383\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.589\nCuz screen is actually\na reserved word inside,\n\n384\n00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:49.218\nit will override part of\nthe property of the window.\n\n385\n00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:50.980\nSo maybe we don't wanna do that.\n\n386\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.839\nBut we can say, gameScreen like so,\n\n387\n00:22:54.839 --> 00:23:00.470\ngameScreen, like so, and\n\n388\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:05.455\nnow we need to pass in the game screen for\nthe internal game screen.\n\n389\n00:23:05.455 --> 00:23:07.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n390\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.880\n&gt;&gt; Naming's hard.\n\n391\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.039\nI'm not gonna lie.\n\n392\n00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:15.632\nNow if we have this kind of worked\nout a little better There we go,\n\n393\n00:23:15.632 --> 00:23:17.910\nwe have our\n&gt;&gt; Does he move?\n\n394\n00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.870\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n&gt;&gt; He's moving and he shoots too.\n\n395\n00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.480\n&gt;&gt; And he does.\n\n396\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.660\nAnd I have now guaranteed that the SVG\nloads before the game kicks off.\n\n397\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n398\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Now if we look at this,\nour attackers are still yellow blocks.\n\n399\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.150\nI would like to have them be those\nangry raisins with tentacles.\n\n400\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.600\n&gt;&gt; We need the angry raisins.\n\n401\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.590\n&gt;&gt; We do, we do, but Zach,\n\n402\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.860\nI'm looking at the clock and it might\nbe best if we come back for a part two.\n\n403\n00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.173\nBecause there's not necessarily\na whole lot of different things but\n\n404\n00:23:48.173 --> 00:23:49.816\nthere may be a few kind of.\n\n405\n00:23:49.816 --> 00:23:52.768\nCuz now we have to make\nsure that both images\n\n406\n00:23:52.768 --> 00:23:56.051\nare loaded before we can\ninstantiate the game.\n\n407\n00:23:56.051 --> 00:24:00.700\nSo that's just part of the asynchronicity\ngame that we play with JavaScript.\n\n408\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.180\nSo let's come back with a part two to\nactually address the attackers, per se.\n\n409\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right cuz we've turned the swarm\ninto sprites and I wanna see that happen.\n\n410\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.570\nSo, Adding Sprites part two.\n\n411\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.440\nThis has been part one and\nI can't wait for part two.\n\n412\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.870\nBut before we leave,\nyou look like you wanna say something.\n\n413\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.366\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is one of those things where\nit seems like we're working backwards, but\n\n414\n00:24:20.366 --> 00:24:22.154\nthat's what happens in a normal project.\n\n415\n00:24:22.154 --> 00:24:26.820\nYou're like I got it working,\nand then, I wanna add images.\n\n416\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.220\nThe current structure I have\ndoesn't really work for images, so\n\n417\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.850\nnow I have to go change some other things.\n\n418\n00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.470\nThat's just the nature of the game.\n\n419\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.090\nSo don't be,\nI wanted to be very explicit and\n\n420\n00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.760\nkind of transparent about this process,\ncuz you're gonna encounter this.\n\n421\n00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.360\nDon't worry about it.\n\n422\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.958\nGet something working, make it better,\nbreak it, you have to make changes.\n\n423\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:51.750\nAnd we may have to take a few steps\nback to get our sprites actually added.\n\n424\n00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.083\nBut it does kind of let you see, well,\nthis one works synchronously, this other\n\n425\n00:24:55.083 --> 00:24:58.631\none works asynchronously, and there's\ndifferent patterns that fall out of those.\n\n426\n00:24:58.631 --> 00:25:02.200\nSo don't be discouraged,\nkeep moving forward.\n\n427\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Doing an awesome job,\nJustin, as always.\n\n428\n00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.030\nAdding Sprites part one,\npart two is coming, and\n\n429\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.052\nmake sure you watch everything in\nthe HTML5 canvas project series.\n\n430\n00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:14.430\nCuz they're amazing,\nJustin's amazing what he does for us And\n\n431\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.860\ntake a look at the course library too.\n\n432\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.480\nThere's hundreds of videos there and\n\n433\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.940\nthey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n434\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.200\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevPro.TV, they'll be very glad you did.\n\n435\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.240\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n436\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.827\n&gt;&gt;

It is good to be here Zach,\nand thanks for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.073\n&gt;&gt; And how are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:39.558\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited as we move forward\nbuilding this game, attacker or\n\n14\n00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:41.670\nhowever you want to call it.\n\n15\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.175\nAnd the last episode,\nwe had built the fire.\n\n16\n00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:49.117\nAnd so we were looking at building\nthe sprites that will be the attackers of\n\n17\n00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:49.760\nthe swarm.\n\n18\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.413\nIsn't that right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:50.999\nIs that gonna be different?\n\n20\n00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's something that we\nprobably need to get a plan for, right?\n\n21\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.850\nWe got the fighter working in part one.\n\n22\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.830\nWe needed to get the swarm working,\ncuz they're still yellow blocks.\n\n23\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.647\nSo let's do a little bit of planning out,\nwhat are some possible things\n\n24\n00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:11.758\nthat I need to change in order\nto get things working, right?\n\n25\n00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:13.073\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahaead and talk a look at-\n&gt;&gt; We need them more spritely.\n\n26\n00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at the code here,\nand I come and look at my main.js.\n\n27\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.213\nWhich actually contains the GameObject\nclass with this constructor and such,\n\n28\n00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:24.212\nI pass in the fighter in the swarm.\n\n29\n00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:26.407\nOkay, ao after that,\n\n30\n00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:29.816\nthis is pretty much all the same-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n31\n00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:30.474\n&gt;&gt; Nothing's changed.\n\n32\n00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:33.050\nBut if I come to app, and I look.\n\n33\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.621\nHere's this loadImage, and I really could\npull this out until like a utils or\n\n34\n00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.689\nanother module.\n\n35\n00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.010\nBut I'm gonna leave it for now,\njust so we can make a reference of it.\n\n36\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.057\nAnd here, I'm gonna say\nloadImage images/fighter.svg.\n\n37\n00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:52.578\nAnd well that's where I pass\nit into the fighter object.\n\n38\n00:01:52.578 --> 00:02:00.607\nBut I'm looking and since we kind\nof grouped the swarm together.\n\n39\n00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:05.090\nI need some way to tell the swarm\nwhat an attacker should look like.\n\n40\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.033\nBecause behind the scenes is the swarm is\nusing a collection of attackers to define\n\n41\n00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:10.613\nitself.\n\n42\n00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:14.910\nSo this swarm, I'm probably gonna\nhave to pass in the sprite there.\n\n43\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.517\nAnd if I come over and look at the swarm,\n\n44\n00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:21.156\nI'm probably gonna have to\nchange a few other things.\n\n45\n00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:25.188\nSo there's some changes to be made,\nbut by and large,\n\n46\n00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:30.113\nI think it's gonna be very similar\nto what we did with the fighter.\n\n47\n00:02:30.113 --> 00:02:31.461\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There's maybe a few extra steps.\n\n48\n00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:36.390\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin, if we're going to be\nloading up multiple images, right?\n\n49\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.974\nBut we loaded up one image,\nnow we have to load up multiple images,\n\n50\n00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:42.285\nhow do we know that they're being loaded?\n\n51\n00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:44.312\n&gt;&gt; Well now we're back\nto the asynchronicity\n\n52\n00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:44.874\nproblem-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Where we're ever gonna actually do that\nrefractor portion that we just discussed.\n\n54\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.866\nWe need to guarantee that how we're\ngoing to represent the attacker,\n\n55\n00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:53.784\nhas been loaded.\n\n56\n00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:56.800\nNow I could find a shortcut around this.\n\n57\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.353\nFull disclosure here, I can actually\nload all of these on page load.\n\n58\n00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:03.042\nAnd hide them in like a hidden div, but\n\n59\n00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:08.350\nmaybe I wanna do other things as they're\nloading and I can make use of that.\n\n60\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.844\nIf I had a bunch of images inside of\nthe HTML, I might still download.\n\n61\n00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:16.600\nMaybe I don't need the game over\nimage until a little bit later.\n\n62\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.950\nSo I can also load images a little\nbit differently programmatically.\n\n63\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.180\nI can kick off a bunch of request\nget them more or less concurrently,\n\n64\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.210\nand now I'm going to oversimplify this.\n\n65\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.812\nHow long it takes to load images is going\nto be based on how long the longest image\n\n66\n00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:37.068\nload takes.\n\n67\n00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:41.043\n&gt;&gt; So if they each took one second,\nwell if I do that programatically,\n\n68\n00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:44.696\nI'm not saying that the HTML\ndoesn't do this to some extent.\n\n69\n00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:48.298\nIf I did this programatically, I can kind\nof ensure that I go and reach out for\n\n70\n00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:49.350\nall of them.\n\n71\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.500\nAnd then if this one takes one second,\nthis other one takes a half a second, and\n\n72\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.860\nthis other one takes a half a second.\n\n73\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.604\nWell altogether,\n\n74\n00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:58.538\nit's gonna take one second cuz I'm\ngonna be grabbing them concurrently.\n\n75\n00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:02.542\nSo I'll do this programmatically, and\nI'll have a little bit more control and\n\n76\n00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.180\nI don't have to touch the dom.\n\n77\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.045\n&gt;&gt; And I had one more question too,\nbecause I need to ask this.\n\n78\n00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:10.040\n[LAUGH] So right now,\nwe have five attackers, right?\n\n79\n00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.866\nOkay, so\nyou're gonna change them all to sprites.\n\n80\n00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:13.370\nDo you have to do that individually?\n\n81\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.130\nCan you change them all at one time?\n\n82\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.224\n&gt;&gt; I think if we refactor\nthe swarm appropriately that,\n\n83\n00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:23.332\nthat should propagate\nthrough all of the attackers.\n\n84\n00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:25.948\nAnd I think that brings up a good point,\n\n85\n00:04:25.948 --> 00:04:29.610\nI'm gonna assume that a swarm\nare all like attackers.\n\n86\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.532\nI'm not gonna have one that\nmoves faster than the other.\n\n87\n00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:32.185\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n88\n00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.121\n&gt;&gt; They're not that dynamic in nature,\n\n89\n00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:37.720\nwhich means I'm gonna use the same\nsprite for all of the attackers.\n\n90\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.285\n&gt;&gt; But you could do that down the line.\n\n91\n00:04:40.285 --> 00:04:43.647\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a little more work,\nand maybe that would be an interesting\n\n92\n00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:44.973\nextension problem to see-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:50.864\n&gt;&gt; Someone take on, but with that said,\nwe never kind of our idea our plan.\n\n94\n00:04:50.864 --> 00:04:51.674\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n95\n00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.578\n&gt;&gt; Let's get that image loaded first-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n96\n00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:55.978\n&gt;&gt; Before we worry about anything else,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:57.180\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n98\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.497\nAnd if we come over to main.j nope,\nap.js, I load this image.\n\n99\n00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:09.851\nNow here, here's the problem.\n\n100\n00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.685\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n101\n00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:16.794\nWell then I want to run this,\nactually that's gonna give me\n\n102\n00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:22.330\nthe fighterSprite because that's\nattached to the loadImage.\n\n103\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.618\nAnd if I use a bunch of dot thens like\nthis, I have to do a one, then the next,\n\n104\n00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:26.309\nthen the next.\n\n105\n00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:31.211\nBut they're contained within function\nscope, and it's not quite gonna work out.\n\n106\n00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:36.310\nSo here's what's going to happen.\n\n107\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.020\nYou ready?\n&gt;&gt; Ready.\n\n108\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.533\n&gt;&gt; You ready?\n\n109\n00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:41.960\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna create an array called Images.\n\n110\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.515\nAnd to some extent,\nthis is gonna be ordered,\n\n111\n00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:47.865\nI have to remember that a particular\nimage is gonna be first.\n\n112\n00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:48.994\nThis particular image is gonna be second.\n\n113\n00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:53.932\nAnd what I'm gonna do is,\n[COUGH] let me name this\n\n114\n00:05:53.932 --> 00:05:58.145\nmore appropriately, ImagePromises.\n\n115\n00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:04.734\nSo that's what we used up here, it's a way\nto eventually I'll give you this file.\n\n116\n00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:09.172\nSo I'm gonna say, loadImage and\n\n117\n00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:13.934\nwhich one images/fighter.svg.\n\n118\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:24.669\nAnd loadImage Images/attacker.svg,\njust like that.\n\n119\n00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:25.211\n&gt;&gt; That's a loaded line.\n\n120\n00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:25.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n121\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.000\nNow we're actually gonna break that up,\nso it's not quite as bad.\n\n122\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.328\nBut let's go look at that\nbefore I go any further.\n\n123\n00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:38.744\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if I refresh ImagePromises,\n\n124\n00:06:38.744 --> 00:06:40.590\npromises.\n\n125\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.502\nSo now I have an array of two promises and\nthey're actually resolved.\n\n126\n00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:46.731\nAnd if I look, there's an image,\nthat's actually the fighter.\n\n127\n00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:47.299\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Were we have it,\n\n128\n00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:48.187\nor we're loading it again.\n\n129\n00:06:48.187 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd over here,\nif we look that is the attacker.\n\n130\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.390\nSo these happen really fast actually,\n\n131\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.760\nbecause I'm doing both of\nthem at the same time.\n\n132\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.890\nNow, here's the problem,\nI can't attach a dot then this array.\n\n133\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:16.092\nI can't say after you grab all of these\nimages, now do this other thing, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:16.092 --> 00:07:20.364\nBut what I can do is within this promise,\n\n135\n00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:25.410\nI can say Promise.all\nimagePromises like so.\n\n136\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.921\nOnce I have all of these promises\nresolved, this is saying once everything\n\n137\n00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:36.095\nin this array has resolved,\nthen run this other portion here, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:41.800\nAnd I'm gonna say sprites like so,\nand this is gonna break my game,\n\n139\n00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.820\nSprites and refresh, but look.\n\n140\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.939\nI have an array of images\nwithin now inside it.\n\n141\n00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:49.517\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n142\n00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:52.540\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually it's my fighter and\nmy attacker.\n\n143\n00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.879\nNow [COUGH] I've covered promises\nin a course library at fair\n\n144\n00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.733\namount with an JavaScript.\n\n145\n00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:02.690\nYou should definitely go\ncheck those out if you, man,\n\n146\n00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.030\nI have no idea what he's doing.\n\n147\n00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.232\nWell this is a great way to handle\nasynchronicity at least with a fair amount\n\n148\n00:08:09.232 --> 00:08:11.177\nof concurrency and performance.\n\n149\n00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:14.210\nThere's no guarantee that\nit's still gonna be fast.\n\n150\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.452\nHowever, it does guarantee that both\nimages are loaded before the game starts.\n\n151\n00:08:17.452 --> 00:08:20.448\nAnd I have access to them in an array.\n\n152\n00:08:20.448 --> 00:08:22.569\n&gt;&gt; Seems reasonable.\n\n153\n00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:25.237\n&gt;&gt; Again,\nthis is a newer browser type thing,\n\n154\n00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:28.450\nif you haven't heard me say that before.\n\n155\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.430\nReally, what I'm gonna get is this,\nfighterSprite,\n\n156\n00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:41.273\nAnd attackerSprite like so, = Sprites, so\n\n157\n00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:47.377\nI'm kind of unpacking those,\npulling those apart.\n\n158\n00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:52.212\nNow how many things are in here\nare kind of decided by how many\n\n159\n00:08:52.212 --> 00:08:54.350\nare inside of this array?\n\n160\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.012\nSo how many promises I have there?\n\n161\n00:08:56.012 --> 00:09:00.800\nIs how many resolve values I\nhave in the other portion.\n\n162\n00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.040\nWith that, with error handling\nlike be a wrong URL something,\n\n163\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.443\nif you have a bunch of promises and\nyou call promise.all on them.\n\n164\n00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:13.864\nYou're error handling may,\nexcuse me, I'm pretty like 95% sure,\n\n165\n00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:17.348\nthat it will throw and\nerror if even one of them messes up.\n\n166\n00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.680\nSo do keep that in mind,\nthere's some things there.\n\n167\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.190\nBut now that I have fighterSprite,\nI should be back to exactly what I had and\n\n168\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.347\nI didn't, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:31.636\nBut I fixed it, but I now have access\nto the attackerSprite, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:32.532\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n\n171\n00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n172\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.279\n&gt;&gt; And raisins here, we come.\n\n173\n00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:42.790\n&gt;&gt; And just to show you,\nI'm gonna say document.body.appendChild.\n\n174\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.629\nNow I'm touching the dom,\nI won't necessarily do this all time.\n\n175\n00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:52.850\nSo I'm just gonna put it at\nthe bottom of the page, like so.\n\n176\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.980\nAnd right down here.\n\n177\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.380\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; There it is, angry raisin or\n\n178\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.375\nmaybe it's a raisin cyclops,\nI don't know, who knows.\n\n179\n00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that attacker sprite.\n\n180\n00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:07.980\nNow [COUGH] the fighter doesn't\neven know about the attackerSprite.\n\n181\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.953\nThe game spring doesn't.\n\n182\n00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:11.564\nThe game actually doesn't\nneed to know about it.\n\n183\n00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:16.760\nThe only thing that's constructed during\nthis dot event is the actual swarm object.\n\n184\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.650\nThe swarm constructs a collection\nof attackers that act as a unit.\n\n185\n00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.015\nAs it stands now, there's no way for\nthe swarm to know about that.\n\n186\n00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:26.193\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n187\n00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.589\n&gt;&gt; That, that could be a problem.\n\n188\n00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:29.085\n&gt;&gt; How do we fix that, Justin?\n\n189\n00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:31.570\n&gt;&gt; How do we fix that?\n\n190\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:38.200\nWell if I come over here and I look,\n100, 100, 5, what does that represent?\n\n191\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.237\nNow if you come over here to the swarm,\nthat's actually xy position and\n\n192\n00:10:42.237 --> 00:10:44.550\nthen number of attackers inside swarm.\n\n193\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.668\nAll right, now we've made our\nswarm very kind of simple,\n\n194\n00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:51.201\nit is a single row, given a number.\n\n195\n00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:54.250\nSo if I look inside a swarm,\nthis .attackers = createSwarm.\n\n196\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.804\nAnd that's because I kept a function\nthat I used previously before refactor,\n\n197\n00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:01.643\njust because well full disclosure,\nI'm lazy.\n\n198\n00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:06.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nothing could\nbe further from the truth.\n\n199\n00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:07.751\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hardest working man,\n\n200\n00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.250\nI've ever met in my life right here.\n\n201\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.678\n&gt;&gt; But the only way you can work hard\nis by choosing your bouts of laziness.\n\n202\n00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:15.393\n&gt;&gt; Well there's that.\n\n203\n00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:21.500\n&gt;&gt; So this createsSwarm effectively,\nI think that needs to be changed as well.\n\n204\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.811\nBecause the attacker is gonna need\nto know about its sprite, and\n\n205\n00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.907\nthat's because I wanna show a pattern.\n\n206\n00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:30.650\nThere's nothing that says\nthat has to be the case.\n\n207\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.125\nI could come down here and\nsay for every attacker,\n\n208\n00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:38.695\nI wanna write instead of using\nthe render method on the attacker.\n\n209\n00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:43.140\nAnd actually let me get some over scroll,\nso you can see here.\n\n210\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.851\nInstead of calling it\nattacker.render inside of the swarm,\n\n211\n00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:48.467\nI just write my own custom render for\neach of the attackers.\n\n212\n00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:53.856\nAnd then do that inside of the swarm,\nbut I'm not gonna do that.\n\n213\n00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:55.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here's what we're gonna do.\n\n214\n00:11:55.755 --> 00:12:00.892\nLet's say attackerSprite just for\nclarity, and\n\n215\n00:12:00.892 --> 00:12:08.126\nI'm going to save that, because you\nnever know when it might come up.\n\n216\n00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:12.724\nAnd attackerSprite = attackerSprite,\n\n217\n00:12:12.724 --> 00:12:19.957\ncuz I'm going to be passing this\nkinda around all over the place.\n\n218\n00:12:19.957 --> 00:12:26.630\nAnd then this createSwarm, I think this\nshould know about the attackerSprite.\n\n219\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.506\nBecause it's going to construct our\nindividual attackers as a collection.\n\n220\n00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:33.762\nSo it's going to make a bunch of them,\nit's essentially a factory for\n\n221\n00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:34.845\na bunch of attackers.\n\n222\n00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:36.727\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if I pass that through,\n\n223\n00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:38.630\nI need to pass it up here.\n\n224\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.958\nSo let's just call it sprite,\nbecause we are now in a different scope.\n\n225\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:49.350\nAnd then I think the attacker shouldn't\nknow about its own sprite as well.\n\n226\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.246\nSo I've kind of passed that\nthrough from the game, right?\n\n227\n00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:58.760\nThe at .js, and\nthen I passed it through to the swarm.\n\n228\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.710\nAnd then createSwarm and\nthen to the attacker, but\n\n229\n00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.186\nthe attacker has no idea\nwhat to do with it.\n\n230\n00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:09.260\nSo I need to hop over here to the\nattacker, and very similarly that I did\n\n231\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.930\nto the fighter, well I'm gonna say sprite,\nremove this color portion.\n\n232\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.656\nSay this.sprite = sprite,\nand because we now have,\n\n233\n00:13:19.656 --> 00:13:23.673\nwait, I say we keep them\nvery similar in size.\n\n234\n00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:27.520\nLet's change this to 32 by 32,\n32 pixels by 32 pixels.\n\n235\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.725\nAnd then the render, well we don't\nneed color anymore, it's done.\n\n236\n00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:39.576\nBut what we do need is draw image,\nand this.sprite.\n\n237\n00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:45.069\nAnd Zach, I can now say with\na fair amount of certainty\n\n238\n00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:53.022\nthat there are some strong overlaps\nbetween fighter and attacker as a class.\n\n239\n00:13:53.022 --> 00:13:53.849\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n240\n00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:55.800\nSo render, these are exactly the same.\n\n241\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.714\nAttacker constructor, there's only\none like one thing that's not, so\n\n242\n00:14:01.714 --> 00:14:03.098\nwe could modify that.\n\n243\n00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:07.030\nBut just for clarity,\nlet's leave it be, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.821\nNow that we have that,\nif we come back to app.js,\n\n245\n00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:19.589\nwe can pass in the attackerSprite and\nwe should have things that are broke.\n\n246\n00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:20.122\n&gt;&gt; It's broke.\n\n247\n00:14:20.122 --> 00:14:26.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So number of attackers is\nnot defined, well let's go and look.\n\n248\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:31.635\nNumber of attackers, I accidentally made\na typo when I was adding the sprite.\n\n249\n00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:35.002\nIf we come over here to Swarm,\nI put an m on there,\n\n250\n00:14:35.002 --> 00:14:37.869\nwhen I went to put the comma, whoops.\n\n251\n00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:38.933\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so if I refresh.\n\n252\n00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:40.879\n&gt;&gt; Angry raisins.\n\n253\n00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:44.430\n&gt;&gt; Angry raisins, and let's see if I can.\n\n254\n00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.498\nLook at that.\n\n255\n00:14:47.498 --> 00:14:48.519\n&gt;&gt; And they get killed.\n\n256\n00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:53.428\n&gt;&gt; And they do, and now we have a swarm\nof angry raisins coming after our\n\n257\n00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:56.610\nlittle tank, and our tank still moves.\n\n258\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.082\nWe've added sprites, we did have to make\nsome changes some moving around of codes,\n\n259\n00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:05.486\nsome rethinking our process,\nbut it is available.\n\n260\n00:15:05.486 --> 00:15:07.325\nIt's kind of looking more like an-\n&gt;&gt; I am happy.\n\n261\n00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:08.165\n&gt;&gt; Amo attacker, right?\n\n262\n00:15:08.165 --> 00:15:08.716\n&gt;&gt; I am happy.\n\n263\n00:15:08.716 --> 00:15:10.078\n&gt;&gt; So-\n&gt;&gt; I have a question though.\n\n264\n00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:10.659\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n265\n00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.502\n&gt;&gt; Seems like we have to pass that through\na lot, is there another way to do this?\n\n266\n00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:18.453\n&gt;&gt; There actually is, and so\nwhat Zach is referring to I think, and\n\n267\n00:15:18.453 --> 00:15:20.820\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\n268\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.052\nIs the passing through of this sprite-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:26.395\n&gt;&gt; Through the swarm in to\nthe attacker object, into this-\n\n270\n00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:26.897\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n271\n00:15:26.897 --> 00:15:27.456\n&gt;&gt; Helper function.\n\n272\n00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:27.966\n&gt;&gt; Lots of passes.\n\n273\n00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:29.906\n&gt;&gt; I'm passing this around,\nis there a better way?\n\n274\n00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:30.472\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n275\n00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:34.898\n&gt;&gt; Well I could say when\nI create a swarm object,\n\n276\n00:15:34.898 --> 00:15:40.840\nI can change this from a class\nmaybe to a factory function.\n\n277\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.760\nAnd then load the image there and\nreturn a promise.\n\n278\n00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.580\nMaybe create swarm is now\na promise based and returns that.\n\n279\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.339\nI could also do a similar thing for\nthe fighter,\n\n280\n00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:55.045\nlike create fighter returns a promise.\n\n281\n00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:56.981\nAnd inside that's gonna load an image and\n\n282\n00:15:56.981 --> 00:15:59.130\nthen when the image\nloads it returns itself.\n\n283\n00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.897\nSo I wanted to make this a little clear.\n\n284\n00:16:00.897 --> 00:16:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of options,\nI mean it's in there.\n\n285\n00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.993\n&gt;&gt; There is a great amount of options and\njust passing this through.\n\n286\n00:16:05.993 --> 00:16:11.970\nIt cause the minimal disruption, instead\nof a large kind of restructuring the code.\n\n287\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.613\nIsn't that ideal?\n\n288\n00:16:12.613 --> 00:16:16.814\nNo, but a second option is\nI could create a template\n\n289\n00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:19.242\nattacker-\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n290\n00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:23.534\nAnd pass in an attacker object to\nthe swarm that already has the sprite\n\n291\n00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.440\nassociated with it.\n\n292\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.198\nAnd then I don't have to\npass the sprite down,\n\n293\n00:16:28.198 --> 00:16:32.391\nthe swarm uses kind of this templated\nattacker to build the swarm out.\n\n294\n00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.729\nBut then that means instead\nof having just a swarm here,\n\n295\n00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:37.940\nI would have to create an attacker.\n\n296\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.458\nAnd then pass that to the swarm or\nattacker template,\n\n297\n00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:43.420\nthat also may be thrown away.\n\n298\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.756\nAnd I think just passing the sprite\ndown through swarm constructor and\n\n299\n00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:51.900\nthen into the attacker constructor.\n\n300\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.376\nI think that makes it a little easier,\n\n301\n00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:55.828\na little easier to follow why\nthings are going the way they are.\n\n302\n00:16:55.828 --> 00:16:58.860\nInstead of causing a mass disruption.\n\n303\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.049\n&gt;&gt; So that sounds like a better plan.\n\n304\n00:17:00.049 --> 00:17:03.670\nDo we have time to do something like\nthat now, or do we have to wait?\n\n305\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.943\n&gt;&gt; I would say,\nlet's just hold off on that.\n\n306\n00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.683\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I like where it is, and\n\n307\n00:17:07.683 --> 00:17:10.560\nthe asynchronicity has been handled.\n\n308\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.430\nLet me show you a few utility functions.\n\n309\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.571\nWe may have to do some\nclean up in the future.\n\n310\n00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:19.742\nBut I think this is at a good stopping\npoint where we have both our attackers and\n\n311\n00:17:19.742 --> 00:17:21.040\nour fighter.\n\n312\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.003\nThey now have sprites,\nthey're no longer just rectangles.\n\n313\n00:17:23.003 --> 00:17:25.930\nThey're hit boxes are,\njust so we're clear.\n\n314\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.313\nThe rectangle you saw, when the pellet\nhits the outer edge of that rectangle or\n\n315\n00:17:32.313 --> 00:17:34.726\nsquare in the case of the attacker.\n\n316\n00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:40.000\nWhen it hits that, that's when it\nis determined to be hit and remove.\n\n317\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.049\nSo both of those still apply,\nthere is a bounting box or\n\n318\n00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:47.557\nwhat's known as a hit box that you can't\nsee even though the image is not square or\n\n319\n00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:49.431\nrectangular in nature any more.\n\n320\n00:17:49.431 --> 00:17:52.510\n&gt;&gt; Well Justin, you're doing an amazing\njobs adding sprites part two.\n\n321\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.780\nThere was part one, watch them both.\n\n322\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.070\nWatch everything in\nthe HTML5 Canvas project series.\n\n323\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.160\nGo to our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n324\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.650\nAnd they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n325\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.756\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevPro.TV.\n\n326\n00:18:03.756 --> 00:18:05.541\nThey'll be mighty glad you did.\n\n327\n00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:07.255\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n328\n00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:08.196\n&gt;&gt;

go.\n\n3\n00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:21.559\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with HTML 5 Canvas Projects.\n\n4\n00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.098\nWe're gonna be adding a sound today,\nthis is pretty exciting stuff and\n\n5\n00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:27.051\nJustin Dennison is here to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.010\nJustin, great to have you here.\n\n7\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520\n&gt;&gt; It is great to be back Zach,\nI'm pretty excited but how are you today?\n\n8\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, thrilled because I've kind\nof followed you through this whole\n\n9\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.300\nseries we've been doing and you've said\nbefore you wanted to add the sounds.\n\n10\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.810\nThe number one question\nis how did you add sound?\n\n11\n00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're actually gonna\nbe adding them to our project,\n\n12\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.850\nbut where did I get them?\n\n13\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.500\n&gt;&gt; Where did you get them?\n\n14\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.734\n&gt;&gt; Where did I get these sounds, and well,\nI'm not gonna show you what they sound\n\n15\n00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:57.136\nlike, I want that to be a surprise\nthroughout this episode, or\n\n16\n00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:59.400\nwho knows it might take longer than that.\n\n17\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.473\nBut I've always wanted\nto do voice over work.\n\n18\n00:01:02.473 --> 00:01:03.524\nI tend to be very animated,\n\n19\n00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:05.340\nin case you haven't noticed-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.000\n&gt;&gt; In our videos.\n\n21\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.048\nI actually recorded all of them.\n\n22\n00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:10.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Using my voice.\n\n23\n00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:15.388\nAll the sounds you are going to hear,\nI've added of me being recorded.\n\n24\n00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:17.480\nI didn't practice it wasn't some,\nI just kind of do this for\n\n25\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.850\nthe moment cuz I think it's funny.\n\n26\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.810\nAnd hopefully, you will enjoy it as well.\n\n27\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.358\nIf I really-\n&gt;&gt; Like I'm on the way I'm really\n\n28\n00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:24.120\nhere right now.\n\n29\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.510\n&gt;&gt; If I really wanted to be professional\nbut I probably would spend some time with\n\n30\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.250\nmiked up with headphones making sure I\nget teaches right and things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.570\nSometimes it turned up pretty good\na couple of them when I was like\n\n32\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.870\nwe changes little bit.\n\n33\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.852\nI haven't thought about going crazy and\njust gone Bang or Pow.\n\n34\n00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:43.519\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like a la Adam West Batman,\n\n35\n00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:47.114\nwith all the onomatopoeia,\nor something like that.\n\n36\n00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:48.578\n&gt;&gt; Biff Bang Pow.\n\n37\n00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:50.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Bang Pow, but\nthat's not what I did.\n\n38\n00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.090\nAnd well, I'm gonna hold back and say,\nyou'll just have to wait and find out.\n\n39\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.991\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n40\n00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, where did we leave off?\n\n41\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.530\nWe have our betas, we have our swarm,\nour attackers and our swarm, our pellets.\n\n42\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.648\nIt's all good and we actually loaded\nimages for those respective things, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:12.925\nNow, the way we did that is\nnot necessarily the best way,\n\n44\n00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.520\nit's hard to say what is the best way.\n\n45\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.240\nBut it is a way, and we'll get to that.\n\n46\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.180\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here,\n\n47\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.530\nand just quickly peruse the ab.js.\n\n48\n00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.500\nSo here's our load image, and\nthat returns a new promise.\n\n49\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.370\nAnd what that does is create an image,\nsets the source, and on load,\n\n50\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.840\nwhen the image is actually finally loaded,\nit resolves the promise.\n\n51\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.860\nAnd that's how I get those assets back.\n\n52\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.860\nI use that to load the fighter image and\nthe attacker image, and\n\n53\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.730\ncall promise to all.\n\n54\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.510\nSo I can get all of these\nthings kinda loading at once.\n\n55\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.680\nNow, the actual sound API.\n\n56\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.820\nThe audio API in our browser, it's kind\nof like this, it's similar to this.\n\n57\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.630\nAnd just to show you if I come over here,\nand\n\n58\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.644\nI open up console window and\nthat say new Audio.\n\n59\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.420\nNow, you'll notice as I type\nthese AudioContext, AudioNode,\n\n60\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.785\nAudioParameter, AudioBuffer.\n\n61\n00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:18.790\nI'm just gonna stay with Audio because\nthese sound clips are very small.\n\n62\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.413\nThey're more of sound effects.\n\n63\n00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:22.001\n[MUSIC]\n\n64\n00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.040\nSomething like that, right?\n\n65\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.420\nSo if I do then,\nI get an audio tech, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.645\nNow, let's just say\nconst Audio = new Audio,\n\n67\n00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:39.980\nand so I get this audio tag and\n\n68\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.966\nif I console.dir Audio.\n\n69\n00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.717\nAnd so, when I look it's just an HTML, but\n\n70\n00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:52.826\nit's very special because it\nprovides the ability to play\n\n71\n00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:58.190\naudio within the context of,\nwell, the HTML document.\n\n72\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.260\nIf I scroll down,\nyou'll notice there's a source attribute.\n\n73\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.810\nAnd as of right now, it's nothing.\n\n74\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.310\nSo this is playing out very\nsimilar to image, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.201\nNow, I could do some crazy things.\n\n76\n00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:15.130\nLike this loadLmage, I could just\nmake this more generic load asset.\n\n77\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.030\nNow, the load asset would have to take in,\nhey, what asset type are you loading?\n\n78\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.310\nAnd then,\nI would have to build an abstraction.\n\n79\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.450\nI don't think I'm gonna go that way,\n\n80\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.040\nbecause it would be functions returning\nfunctions or a plethora of other things.\n\n81\n00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.308\nI think I'm just gonna very straight\nforward, and more or less just copy and\n\n82\n00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:33.883\npaste this.\n\n83\n00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:40.060\nMake sure that it works, and we'll see how\nthings will kind of play out, all right?\n\n84\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.590\nSo I have this load image.\n\n85\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.710\nNow ultimately, I may extract this to\nsomething else, and have these image\n\n86\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.350\npromises, and this is kind of where\nmy game starts out, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.419\nSo let's see here.\n\n88\n00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.696\nI can say, load function\n\n89\n00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:02.800\nloadAudio, like so, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.840\nNow this is going to take a source,\njust like the loadImage.\n\n91\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.815\nAnd this is gonna return a new Promise.\n\n92\n00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:17.550\nAnd then, it's gonna take a resolve\nstatement, if I can spell resolve.\n\n93\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.290\nAnd you're like, this looks very\nsimilar to stop, and it does.\n\n94\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.280\nThis is gonna be almost an exact replica,\nall right?\n\n95\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.793\nSo if I come here and I say const,\n\n96\n00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:33.869\nlet's just call it sound\n= new Audio like so,\n\n97\n00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.905\nand then some crazy and apparently,\n\n98\n00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:42.650\nI have my hands shifted off to the side.\n\n99\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.188\nLet's hide this for a moment.\n\n100\n00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:50.187\nSound.src = src, and then,\n\n101\n00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:57.280\nsound.onload = an error function.\n\n102\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.376\nSo, I'm taking what I know, right?\n\n103\n00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:04.110\nI'm trying to do,\nhowever do this based on my image.\n\n104\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.270\nBe very careful we may find that\nthere are some new lines differences.\n\n105\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.560\nBut I'm just gonna stay with this for now.\n\n106\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.944\nAnd we're gonna resolve(sound), all right?\n\n107\n00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:18.290\nSo that's what's gonna be\nreturned by the promise.\n\n108\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.990\nSo the call loadAudio, and outside of\nthis, I'm just gonna call loadAudio.\n\n109\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.948\nAnd what audio am I going to load?\n\n110\n00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:33.730\nWell, if I come over here,\ninside of this folder we have mp3 files.\n\n111\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.580\nSo by default, we can could play mp3.\n\n112\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.773\nThey're very small comparatively\nother than dot wave or\n\n113\n00:06:39.773 --> 00:06:42.080\nthat other types of files.\n\n114\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.010\nSo I've chosen mp3 because I\nknow the browser is capable.\n\n115\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.030\nJust be aware older browsers\nmay have some weirdness.\n\n116\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.620\n&gt;&gt; So that's where you said your sound\nbytes that you created in the studio\n\n117\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.350\nwas to mp3.\n\n118\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and full disclosure when we\nrecord to them they were longer,\n\n119\n00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.790\nthey were .wave files so they had\na full kind of analog wave formed.\n\n120\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.669\nWhat I did is, I went into a sound editing\nI chopped out just the tiny bit cuz\n\n121\n00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.158\ntypically effects you want to be\nvery small, very short in length,\n\n122\n00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:16.364\nexcept maybe like a background,\n\n123\n00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:20.494\nsomething that is always playing\nin the background on a loop.\n\n124\n00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:24.701\nAnd then, when I export those I\nsave those as mp3 at that time, so\n\n125\n00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.914\nfor the most part they serve a purpose,\nmp3 gives\n\n126\n00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:33.400\nyou a very small digital file format\nthat should be quick to load, all right?\n\n127\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.969\nSo instead of loading audio like this, I'm\nactually gonna play around on the browser.\n\n128\n00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:46.060\nLet's see here, let's say,\ngame play, game-play.mp3.\n\n129\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.360\nAnd those that's in an fx folder.\n\n130\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.292\nSo sound.fx, all right.\n\n131\n00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:57.200\nSo if I come over here, and I refresh and\n\n132\n00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.930\nI say const soundPromise = loadAudio\n\n133\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.061\nAdd FXgame-play.mp3.\n\n134\n00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:08.299\nExcel.\n\n135\n00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:12.379\nAnd [SOUND], Error file not found.\n\n136\n00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:15.680\nWell, let's try it\na little bit differently.\n\n137\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.429\nLet's say backslash,\ncan't do that, because I used a.\n\n138\n00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:22.453\nSo, if I refresh, and now, I said,\n\n139\n00:08:22.453 --> 00:08:28.030\nbecause I'm serving from a file\nlike this instead of from a server.\n\n140\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.590\nI have to use this relative patting.\n\n141\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.840\nSay start here and move onward.\n\n142\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.880\nSo, we'll look at sound promise, and I\nspell it right, then notice it's pending.\n\n143\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.870\nWell, Justin,\ndidn't you say that was really fast?\n\n144\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.800\nYeah.\n\n145\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.700\nIt should be,\nbecause game play should be tiny.\n\n146\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.950\nWell, let's look at it again.\n\n147\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.140\nIt still says pending.\n\n148\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.560\nWhy would it say pending?\n\n149\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.060\nAll right.\n\n150\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.720\nSo, I said the source, and\nI said sound dot onload.\n\n151\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.720\nWe should probably check the audio API.\n\n152\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.855\nWithin browsers maybe\nusing like Mozilla to make\n\n153\n00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:13.240\nsure that onloads still is used for\nsounds, okay.\n\n154\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.535\nSo, let's see here.\n\n155\n00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:18.707\nLet's see, audio Yahoo MDN let's\n\n156\n00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:23.720\nactually say MozillaDeveloperNetwork.\n\n157\n00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:27.710\nSo, here we go.\n\n158\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.160\nIt's the audio tag.\n\n159\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.180\nAnd what kind of things\nam I going to get here?\n\n160\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.610\nSo, audio streams, subtitles.\n\n161\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.810\nThat's very interesting.\n\n162\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.940\nIdea with element source and\nthat's there's craziness in there.\n\n163\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.850\nI don't see anything about the actual\n\n164\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.030\nunload function, or\nlike a vent that are kicked off.\n\n165\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.439\nSo, if we come and look, [SOUND].\n\n166\n00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:08.807\nLet's see here, sites,\n\n167\n00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:13.447\naudio, HTML onload.\n\n168\n00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:17.559\nThe onload attribute fires when an object\nhas been loaded, most often used blah,\n\n169\n00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:19.630\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n170\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.840\nIf we come to stack overflow.\n\n171\n00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.900\nOr we can use things like this.\n\n172\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.310\nThese are great places to look.\n\n173\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:33.180\nAnd we come and we look,\nonCanPlayThrough, onEnded.\n\n174\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.850\nSo, addEventListener\nended cantPlayThrough.\n\n175\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.670\nOnCanPlayThrough is an event,\nnot a method, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.200\nThis doesn't quite give\nme what I anticipate.\n\n177\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.870\nAdd event listener, load a sound.\n\n178\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.530\nThere it is.\n\n179\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.420\nSo, add event listener for load.\n\n180\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.180\nWell, that should be the on load.\n\n181\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:04.780\n[SOUND] But\nnotice it's calling .load, I wonder.\n\n182\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.190\nAnd then, we may have to\nhand-wave this a little bit.\n\n183\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.560\nLet's call sound.load, like this.\n\n184\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.100\nNow, what is load?\n\n185\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.610\nThat's saying, hey,\nbring that in, get it set up.\n\n186\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.100\nWe come back and we try it out.\n\n187\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.160\nAnd we look.\n\n188\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.470\nSo, there it is.\n\n189\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.570\nLet's look at soundPromise.\n\n190\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.646\nIt's pending.\n\n191\n00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:26.089\nIt's pending.\n\n192\n00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:26.837\nIt's pending.\n\n193\n00:11:26.837 --> 00:11:29.870\nIt's pending.\n\n194\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.144\nSo, that's not quit working\nlike we anticipated.\n\n195\n00:11:33.144 --> 00:11:34.641\nAnd I think that's,\n\n196\n00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:40.390\nbecause the on low is not behaving like\nwe anticipate the image actually working.\n\n197\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.630\nAll right, so that didn't work.\n\n198\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.340\nWhen all else fails,\nwe'll treat is synchronously\n\n199\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.240\nwith being full aware that we\nmay get some weirdness here.\n\n200\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.420\nOkay?, and what I mean is if\nit's a very large sound file,\n\n201\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.220\nit may not behave quite\nlike you anticipate it to.\n\n202\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:09.568\nResolve is not defined,\nthat's because I misspelled it.\n\n203\n00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:11.893\nResolve.\n\n204\n00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.220\nResolve.\n\n205\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.110\nNope.\nStill spelled it wrong.\n\n206\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.790\nResolve.\n\n207\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.830\nThere we go.\n\n208\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.260\nRefresh.\n\n209\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.240\nThere we go.\n\n210\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.970\nSound promise.\n\n211\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.910\nAnd it has been resolved and\nwhat do I have as the promise value?\n\n212\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.750\nBut an audio tag.\n\n213\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.390\nNow, I have this.\n\n214\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:35.356\nAnd what I can do with this promise\nis call .then on it, .then.\n\n215\n00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:40.828\nAnd then,\nI could just say it gives me a sound.\n\n216\n00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:42.488\nAnd let's say sound.play.\n\n217\n00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:46.027\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:12:46.027 --> 00:12:46.957\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n219\n00:12:46.957 --> 00:12:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.\n\n220\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.200\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, do that again, please.\n\n221\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.151\nJust for my own [INAUDIBLE].\n\n222\n00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.473\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's see if I can play it again.\n\n223\n00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:57.830\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n224\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.340\n&gt;&gt; So see, these are gonna be\nsprinkled with all kinds of fun time.\n\n225\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.370\nSo, yes, that is me and doing that sound.\n\n226\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.763\nAnd that's what I'm thinking, just plays\nin the background, just kind of forever.\n\n227\n00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:11.084\n&gt;&gt; So, [SOUND], that's for\nthe little guys moving around?\n\n228\n00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:13.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just playing it\nin the background, [SOUND].\n\n229\n00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.992\n&gt;&gt; The invaders coming down towards you,\ngot it, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:18.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, but we have this sound loaded.\n\n231\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.240\nNow, I wanted to show you that,\n\n232\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.150\nbecause this is something that I've\nrun into before some of these assets\n\n233\n00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:30.340\nan image on assets, but\nthey do behave a little bit differently.\n\n234\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.390\nAnd, because my sounds are so\nsmall, I can get away with more, or\n\n235\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.890\nless treating sounds synchronously.\n\n236\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.280\nIf your sound is very large,\nthat may not be true.\n\n237\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.320\nAnd you may have to come back, and figure\nout if it's not on load, what is it?\n\n238\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.670\nOkay.\n\n239\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.642\nNow, I've made the decision for this\nepisode not to get crazy deep into that,\n\n240\n00:13:52.642 --> 00:13:55.440\njust to provide you a caveat, a warning.\n\n241\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.030\nAll right.\nThis works for me, and I also wanted to\n\n242\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.750\nshow you that premature, if I would have\ntried to go ahead and say load asset.\n\n243\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.580\nAnd use the exact same one,\nit would actually broke for sound.\n\n244\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.460\nSo, even though I thought it\nwas gonna be a copy paste\n\n245\n00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.970\nit ends up being that I had\nto change a few things.\n\n246\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.450\nI had to change how it works.\n\n247\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.268\nThe argument many may have made then,\nwhy do you have this in a promise?\n\n248\n00:14:20.268 --> 00:14:23.540\nAll right, well, here's what I'm thinking,\n\n249\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:30.250\nif I can do like a synchornists load, like\nit's so small it's almost instantaneous.\n\n250\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.160\nAnd I can rely on that I don't need a\npromise, but if I've adopted a pattern of\n\n251\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.841\nsaying, I'm going to load any assets,\nimage, sound, video,\n\n252\n00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:44.710\na synchronously using a promise-base API,\nand\n\n253\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.700\nI'm going to go ahead and\nwrap those, so they're all the same.\n\n254\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.110\nOkay, so I can say load audio,\nload image, and\n\n255\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.890\nthey all return promises, and\nI can kick off and grab them uniformly.\n\n256\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.480\nBut that also means is that image promises\n\n257\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.808\nI would probably just now\ncall these assetPromises and\n\n258\n00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:09.861\nsay load the attacker.\n\n259\n00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.434\nAnd then\n\n260\n00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:21.110\nloadAudio('./fx/game-play.mp3').\n\n261\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.040\nNotice, I now still have uniformity here\nabout how these are being loaded up.\n\n262\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.430\nBut what this is going to mean is now,\nI have to change this variable name.\n\n263\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.720\nAnd I need to change how this works, so\n\n264\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.590\nhow about we pull these apart inside\nof the function call, like so.\n\n265\n00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:49.188\nSo, if I go fighterSprite excel,\n\n266\n00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:53.244\nattackerSprite excel.\n\n267\n00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:58.406\nAnd then, how about gamePlayAudio?\n\n268\n00:15:58.406 --> 00:15:59.861\nLike that.\n\n269\n00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:04.412\nNow I can pull these out, and everything\nshould still work, but now I've resolved\n\n270\n00:16:04.412 --> 00:16:08.520\nall those promises at once, it'll now\nkickoff and we should be good to go.\n\n271\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.494\nSo there we go.\n\n272\n00:16:10.494 --> 00:16:13.166\nAnd because the nature of this episode,\n\n273\n00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:17.566\nthere'll probably be times that I\nturn the sound on, turn it off,\n\n274\n00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:22.140\ncuz that gameplay one, I actually\nwant that to play the entire time.\n\n275\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.440\nThat's the doo dee doo dee doo dee doo.\n\n276\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.563\n&gt;&gt; That this is run, yeah,\nthe doo dee doo dee.\n\n277\n00:16:25.563 --> 00:16:28.530\nSo let's do that first,\nokay, let's do that first.\n\n278\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:34.702\nSo if I come here and I look,\nokay, and I'll look here.\n\n279\n00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:37.736\nI got the game play audio,\nit should be available.\n\n280\n00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:38.660\nAll right, here we go.\n\n281\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.890\nThat's gonna be the first thing.\n\n282\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.490\nIt will not loop.\n\n283\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.874\nLet's just see if I can get it to play.\n\n284\n00:16:44.874 --> 00:16:49.184\nSo gamePlayAudio.play, like so.\n\n285\n00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:53.164\nSo I'm playing this programmatically.\n\n286\n00:16:53.164 --> 00:16:55.953\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so\n\n287\n00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:57.802\nit does play through one time.\n\n288\n00:16:57.802 --> 00:16:58.677\n&gt;&gt; But it won't loop.\n\n289\n00:16:58.677 --> 00:17:00.012\n&gt;&gt; But it won't loop.\n\n290\n00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:03.116\nWell, if I come back over here, and\n\n291\n00:17:03.116 --> 00:17:07.888\nit didn't help me with the actual event,\nthe onload.\n\n292\n00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:12.091\nBut if I come back and I look,\na boolean attribute, if specified,\n\n293\n00:17:12.091 --> 00:17:16.981\nwill automatically seek back to the start\nupon reaching the end of the audio.\n\n294\n00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:24.568\nThere is a loop condition, an attribute\nthat I can place on these audio tags.\n\n295\n00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:27.890\nOkay, so\nthis is gonna be kinda dirty, right?\n\n296\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:33.657\nBut I can say gamePlayAudio.loop = true,\nlike so.\n\n297\n00:17:33.657 --> 00:17:38.805\n&gt;&gt; And then I can say gamePlayAudio.play,\n\n298\n00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:44.578\nlike that, now-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND], perfecto!\n\n299\n00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:47.311\n&gt;&gt; So now it will loop the entire time.\n\n300\n00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:50.071\nNow, you're like, well,\nthey're running off screen.\n\n301\n00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:51.906\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; See how I said this is,\n\n302\n00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.401\nlet's turn that off.\n\n303\n00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:56.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can come back and\n\n304\n00:17:56.199 --> 00:17:57.385\nturn that one on.\n\n305\n00:17:57.385 --> 00:17:58.995\nI'm gonna leave that one turned off,\n\n306\n00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:02.077\ncuz that one is kind of playing in\nthe background the whole time, right?\n\n307\n00:18:02.077 --> 00:18:07.582\nAll right, so we have that first\nthing loaded, what's the next thing?\n\n308\n00:18:07.582 --> 00:18:11.048\nIf I hit the spacebar and\nI'm focused here,\n\n309\n00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:16.592\nI notice just like a noise that is\nassociated with the pellets firing.\n\n310\n00:18:16.592 --> 00:18:17.667\n&gt;&gt; Pew pew pew?\n\n311\n00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:20.591\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nyou just got to wait and see.\n\n312\n00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:22.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You just got to wait and see, Zach.\n\n313\n00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:27.688\nBut if you have a sound here,\nand it is called pew.\n\n314\n00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:31.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow, good guess!\n\n315\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.664\n&gt;&gt; So what I need to do is now come\nback and add that to the load list.\n\n316\n00:18:34.664 --> 00:18:40.871\nSo loadAudio, spell audio correctly,\n\n317\n00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:44.156\nand then ./fx/ and\n\n318\n00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:48.727\nthen pew.mp3, all right.\n\n319\n00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.521\nWhat that means is,\n\n320\n00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:56.333\nI'm gonna rearrange this function\nright here and give me a list.\n\n321\n00:18:56.333 --> 00:19:01.043\nSo let's just call this blasterSound.\n\n322\n00:19:01.043 --> 00:19:05.583\nOkay, so there is the blasterSound, but\n\n323\n00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:13.250\nyou'll notice that where am I setting\nup where those blasters occur?\n\n324\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.651\nLet's go back through and\nlook, so is it in the dighter?\n\n325\n00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:20.500\nNo, the fighter is an object that\njust represents something, okay.\n\n326\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.396\nIt's not in the attacker, where is\nthe blaster portion actually occurring?\n\n327\n00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:30.115\nIt's occurring in the AtmoAttack portion.\n\n328\n00:19:30.115 --> 00:19:36.130\nIf I come here, notice when I hit space,\nthat's where it's occurring.\n\n329\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:41.050\nSo I need to pass that in to AtmoAttack,\nthe game object, for\n\n330\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.277\nit to be effective, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:46.358\nNow, [COUGH] what I'm\ngoing to do is say sound,\n\n332\n00:19:46.358 --> 00:19:49.758\ncuz I have a feeling I'm\ngonna have to do this a lot.\n\n333\n00:19:49.758 --> 00:19:52.737\nAnd the sound is going to be an object,\n\n334\n00:19:52.737 --> 00:19:58.619\nan object that has key value pairs\nassociated with the respective sounds.\n\n335\n00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.135\nAll right, so\nlet's actually pass that in, and\n\n336\n00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:08.432\nif I do this,\nI can say this.sounds = sounds; like so.\n\n337\n00:20:08.432 --> 00:20:13.292\nAnd when I come back to the app,\nI want to, let's collect these sounds with\n\n338\n00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:17.934\nkey value pairs, only the ones that\nneed to be provided to AtmoAttack.\n\n339\n00:20:17.934 --> 00:20:22.333\nSo if I say const sounds here, and\n\n340\n00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:26.271\nthen let's just call it pew.\n\n341\n00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:30.274\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's the blasterSound, okay?\n\n342\n00:20:30.274 --> 00:20:35.271\nNow, I may come back and\nchange that, but I think it's funny.\n\n343\n00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:39.934\nAnd then this sounds is an object with key\nvalue pairs and I'm passing this through,\n\n344\n00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:42.376\nmore or\nless like an enumerated type thing.\n\n345\n00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:49.067\nAnd then sounds, okay there is sounds,\nI've passed that in.\n\n346\n00:20:49.067 --> 00:20:51.624\nLet's add a console.log statement,\njust for giggles.\n\n347\n00:20:51.624 --> 00:20:55.027\nActually, let's put in\na debugger statement.\n\n348\n00:20:55.027 --> 00:20:59.888\nAnd what this will do is when my dev\ntools are open, it will stop right here.\n\n349\n00:20:59.888 --> 00:21:06.148\nSo if I refresh, and there it is, and I\nshould have the ability to say this.sounds\n\n350\n00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:11.164\nin the console and see,\nthis.sounds and PEW audio, all right.\n\n351\n00:21:11.164 --> 00:21:18.611\nSo let's see here,\nif I say this.sounds_PEW.play,\n\n352\n00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:23.574\nand notice, hmm, that's pending,\n\n353\n00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:26.534\nwhat is this pending?\n\n354\n00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:30.024\nWell.\n\n355\n00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:32.656\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n356\n00:21:32.656 --> 00:21:33.385\n&gt;&gt; I heard it.\n\n357\n00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.082\n&gt;&gt; Now, what happened there is,\ntechnically,\n\n358\n00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:40.310\nit returns a promise when I call that\nplay, so I can do, and then do this.\n\n359\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.944\nBut it will queue up to play.\n\n360\n00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:46.511\nBut because I had the browser in debug\nmode and had stopped there, it would never\n\n361\n00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:50.366\ngonna play that, cuz it wouldn't continue\nprocessing events and things like that.\n\n362\n00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:52.670\nSo be aware of that.\n\n363\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:58.437\nBut I know that's there, and\nsince I know that's there,\n\n364\n00:21:58.437 --> 00:22:05.397\nwhat I can do is say well,\nI wanna say this.sounds.PEW.play.\n\n365\n00:22:05.397 --> 00:22:08.270\nNow, I could do a dot then here and\ndo some other things,\n\n366\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.242\nbecause this is returning a promise.\n\n367\n00:22:10.242 --> 00:22:15.802\nI don't need to, I just wanna queue\nit up and it should be fairly quick.\n\n368\n00:22:15.802 --> 00:22:21.245\nNot always guaranteed that it's entirely\naccurate, but let's just see if it.\n\n369\n00:22:21.245 --> 00:22:24.123\n[SOUND]\n\n370\n00:22:24.123 --> 00:22:26.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n371\n00:22:26.966 --> 00:22:27.819\n&gt;&gt; Brilliant!\n\n372\n00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:32.493\n&gt;&gt; There we have it,\nwe have our pew pew pew, right?\n\n373\n00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:35.973\n&gt;&gt; Brilliant.\n&gt;&gt; So there is pew, [SOUND] ha, so\n\n374\n00:22:35.973 --> 00:22:38.343\nthat makes me happy.\n\n375\n00:22:38.343 --> 00:22:40.777\nAnd now when I come back and\nturn that other sound back on,\n\n376\n00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:43.631\nwe're not done with sounds, but\nI think this is a good final test.\n\n377\n00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:48.456\nIt looks like we're gonna have to come\nback to a part two to finish those out.\n\n378\n00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:54.174\nBut [COUGH] if I come back to the app,\nand I turn on the game play audio.\n\n379\n00:22:54.174 --> 00:22:55.749\nLet's see here.\n\n380\n00:22:55.749 --> 00:23:00.863\n[SOUND] You'll notice something actually,\n\n381\n00:23:00.863 --> 00:23:05.844\nZach, the sounds do play at the same time.\n\n382\n00:23:05.844 --> 00:23:07.899\n&gt;&gt; I know that it's making me laugh.\n\n383\n00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:10.845\n[LAUGH] Brilliant, very well done.\n\n384\n00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:14.504\n&gt;&gt; So you gotta save this, there we go.\n\n385\n00:23:14.504 --> 00:23:16.586\nTurn that [SOUND].\nSo it's funny, but it can be annoying,\n\n386\n00:23:16.586 --> 00:23:17.942\nI have full recognition of that.\n\n387\n00:23:17.942 --> 00:23:21.981\n[SOUND] But notice, I shot two times,\nbut it didn't go pew pew two times.\n\n388\n00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:23.901\n&gt;&gt; And I do have a question for you.\n\n389\n00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:24.715\nI'm sure you can do this.\n\n390\n00:23:24.715 --> 00:23:26.541\nHow do adjust the volume?\n\n391\n00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.652\nLike one's louder than the other,\nhotter than the other?\n\n392\n00:23:28.652 --> 00:23:29.385\nCan you do that?\n\n393\n00:23:29.385 --> 00:23:34.374\n&gt;&gt; So you can do that in the browser,\nthe audio API is pretty crazy actually.\n\n394\n00:23:34.374 --> 00:23:37.722\nSo you saw all of those things earlier\nin the episode, like audio buffer,\n\n395\n00:23:37.722 --> 00:23:39.831\naudio context,\nyou can do some crazy things.\n\n396\n00:23:39.831 --> 00:23:43.886\nMy recommendation,\nwhat I did is when I edited the sounds,\n\n397\n00:23:43.886 --> 00:23:45.924\nI actually changed the gain.\n\n398\n00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:51.326\nAnd for something simple,\nit's probably easier to edit the file,\n\n399\n00:23:51.326 --> 00:23:54.281\nto actually give relative amounts.\n\n400\n00:23:54.281 --> 00:23:58.812\nBut if I am not mistaken,\nactually, let's just look, so\n\n401\n00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:02.418\nif we look and volume,\nyou can actually modify\n\n402\n00:24:02.418 --> 00:24:05.763\nthe relative volume as we have seen here-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n403\n00:24:05.763 --> 00:24:07.993\nyou can do that after you've\nrecorded that actual sound?\n\n404\n00:24:07.993 --> 00:24:13.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm not sure what\nthe default value is for that.\n\n405\n00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:17.467\nSo it goes from zero to one,\nwhere one is the possible loudest,\n\n406\n00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:20.450\nI'm not entirely sure where it starts out.\n\n407\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.053\nIf it's like 0.5 and\nthen you can make it louder, or\n\n408\n00:24:23.053 --> 00:24:24.932\nif it says this is the loudest it can be.\n\n409\n00:24:24.932 --> 00:24:30.499\nAnd then something crazy you could do,\nand it would require some restructuring,\n\n410\n00:24:30.499 --> 00:24:34.303\nthat dot then that we're doing,\nor that we didn't do.\n\n411\n00:24:34.303 --> 00:24:39.681\nIf we come over here into the main.js,\nwe could say if we passed\n\n412\n00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:45.471\nin the background audio, or\nwe could handle a keyboard event here.\n\n413\n00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:49.921\nHey, bring that down, play the pew and\nthen bring that volume back up.\n\n414\n00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.641\nBut it would require some restructuring.\n\n415\n00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:55.915\nSo for me, initially what I would\ndo is bring this into an audio,\n\n416\n00:24:55.915 --> 00:24:59.953\nlike a sound editor,\nwhich there are some decent free ones,\n\n417\n00:24:59.953 --> 00:25:02.822\nbring down the relative gains and things.\n\n418\n00:25:02.822 --> 00:25:06.521\nAnd that way,\nyou're not dynamically changing this.\n\n419\n00:25:06.521 --> 00:25:11.853\nBut, [COUGH] there's a second\nthing that kind of bothers me.\n\n420\n00:25:11.853 --> 00:25:16.406\nAnd [SOUND] I actually rapid\nfired two pellets, but\n\n421\n00:25:16.406 --> 00:25:19.992\nI only heard my pew sound once, right?\n\n422\n00:25:19.992 --> 00:25:27.133\nReally, what I should hear is pew pew,\nlike [SOUND] real fast, right?\n\n423\n00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:29.450\nWe need to fix that,\ncuz that would bug me.\n\n424\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.809\nBut I know we have five minutes left,\nthere's a few other things that I wanted\n\n425\n00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:34.994\nto do, I think we need to\ncome back with a part two.\n\n426\n00:25:34.994 --> 00:25:39.410\nFix that, add the final sounds, and,\nwell, see what comes to fruition.\n\n427\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.834\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, can't wait,\nI'm enjoying the heck out of this.\n\n428\n00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:47.023\nHTML5 Canvas Projects, this is\nadding sounds with the one and only,\n\n429\n00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:48.160\nJustin Dennison.\n\n430\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.320\nPart two will be coming up,\nthis has been part one.\n\n431\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.740\nBefore we move,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n432\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.685\n&gt;&gt; Well, definitely stay tuned, you\nhaven't heard all the sound effects and\n\n433\n00:25:57.685 --> 00:26:01.252\nI was quite proud of a few of them,\nso [SOUND] stay tuned.\n\n434\n00:26:01.252 --> 00:26:03.898\n&gt;&gt; And by the way, make sure you\nwatch every single episode of\n\n435\n00:26:03.898 --> 00:26:06.382\nthe HTML5 Canvas Projects,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n436\n00:26:06.382 --> 00:26:10.447\nAnd take a look at the other videos in\nour course library, hundreds of videos,\n\n437\n00:26:10.447 --> 00:26:13.570\nall designed for one thing,\nto help you go further.\n\n438\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.810\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n439\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.380\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n440\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.014\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison!\n\n441\n00:26:19.014 --> 00:26:20.905\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you

It is good to be back in the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.368\nAnd how are you today Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:34.185\n&gt;&gt; I am excited.\n\n12\n00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.940\nThis has been a wonderful series and\nI enjoy every bit of it.\n\n13\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.900\nLet's add some more sound.\n\n14\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.715\n&gt;&gt; All right so let's talk about\nwhere we kinda left off right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:43.244\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n16\n00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:47.348\n&gt;&gt; So we started adding the sounds, and we\nran into a little bit of a problem because\n\n17\n00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:51.085\nthe on load function for a sound doesn't\nquite work the same as it does for\n\n18\n00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.700\nan image for the asynchronous loading.\n\n19\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.830\nWe figured that out.\n\n20\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.320\nAnd along that way,\nwe got some background noise, right?\n\n21\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.272\nI call it noise.\n\n22\n00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:00.216\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.084\n&gt;&gt; Music, background music.\n\n24\n00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:06.500\nAnd then the actual kind of fighters,\nlike pellet.\n\n25\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.060\nThere is a sound associated\nwith firing a pellet.\n\n26\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.539\nNow, we're not quite finished there.\n\n27\n00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.660\nThere's a couple of other\nthings that are weird.\n\n28\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.400\nBut let's see where we are.\n\n29\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.900\nLet's identify what's going on.\n\n30\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.095\nAnd then let's move forward to\nadding those additional sounds.\n\n31\n00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:24.986\nNow I will forewarn you,\none of the sounds that game over sound,\n\n32\n00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:29.640\nit's one of those things where maybe\nit's a little bit of an oversight.\n\n33\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.424\nOnly have a game over sound if you lose.\n\n34\n00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:38.668\nI totally forgot about a game\nover sound if you win.\n\n35\n00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:42.958\nNow I could always go back and record\nthat, or maybe you can add one yourself,\n\n36\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.186\nbut that sound isn't gonna come into\nplay until we can figure out some game.\n\n37\n00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:50.884\nWe just want to make sure that it loads,\nso, that one won't be used until we\n\n38\n00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:54.720\nadd some game over conditions which is\nprobably going to be another episode.\n\n39\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.767\nBut, we can do some other ones.\n\n40\n00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.080\nExplosions of the fighters,\nwe gotta fix some things, but\n\n41\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.940\nbefore we get into that,\nlet's see where we were.\n\n42\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.300\nSo if we take a look at my screen here and\nI'm just gonna refresh.\n\n43\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.261\nAnd you can hear but notice if I\nrapid fire you only here one pew.\n\n44\n00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.587\nBut there's two bullets right,\nthere's two pellets that they get fired.\n\n45\n00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:20.710\nSo here we go I'm gonna do it again.\n\n46\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.077\nNotice that's a single pew.\n\n47\n00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:29.495\nI would really like for and part of\nthat is I'm using a single sound object,\n\n48\n00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:32.390\nan audio object in JavaScript.\n\n49\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.840\nI'd really like for\nthat to play regardless.\n\n50\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.740\nEven for over top of each other.\n\n51\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.290\nNow back in part one I said the sound\nclips were very small except for\n\n52\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.180\nthe background music.\n\n53\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.590\nAnd that's intentional.\n\n54\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.300\nSo if I hit that it should play only for\na very short span of time.\n\n55\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.940\nAnd part of that is I'm not able to\nreplay something that's already playing.\n\n56\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.334\nI would have to do some check,\nstop, rewind, play again.\n\n57\n00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:04.154\nBut I feel like there might\nbe a way to get through this.\n\n58\n00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:09.301\nSo if we come over here and look where\nthat's being played we have this\n\n59\n00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:15.091\nsounds.pew.play and I think we're\ngonna have to modify something there.\n\n60\n00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:17.570\nNow how did that come into effect?\n\n61\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.080\nIf I come over in the app.js I\ncreated this sounds object that I'm\n\n62\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.934\npassing into the game and\nwhat I may do is collect this for\n\n63\n00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:31.160\na couple of the other objects,\nthe sounds that i have to pass around.\n\n64\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.607\nAgain there's probably a better\nstructure to this that I can enforce but\n\n65\n00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:41.515\nit would take an architectural\nchange that maybe not be worth it in\n\n66\n00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:43.764\nthe context of this project.\n\n67\n00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:48.447\nBut just to show you this game audio\nI've actually set it to loop, so\n\n68\n00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:52.483\nthat sound's there,\nI'm not gonna play the whole time.\n\n69\n00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:56.163\nBut if we, [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:03:56.163 --> 00:03:57.645\n&gt;&gt; And then we can play and\n\n71\n00:03:57.645 --> 00:03:59.912\nthat's running the background.\n\n72\n00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:03.540\nSo would think of those sounds\nalways running in the background.\n\n73\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.489\nLet me turn that off.\n\n74\n00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.783\n&gt;&gt; It sounds almost like you\nwere channeling Bobby McPharon.\n\n75\n00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:09.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little bit yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:13.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's a wonderful speaker,\nby the way.\n\n77\n00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:13.697\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:13.697 --> 00:04:15.220\n&gt;&gt; If you've ever seen any of his talks.\n\n79\n00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.020\nSo I want the pew to play on rapid fire.\n\n80\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.050\nEven if I rapid fire,\nI want it go pew pew, pew pew, right?\n\n81\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.840\nSo let's do a little bit\nof exploration here.\n\n82\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.460\nSo let's say audio equals new audio.\n\n83\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.302\nNow this doesn't have anything associated\nwith it, but I look at audio and\n\n84\n00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:46.670\nI say console.log.dirAudio, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.693\nSo here's audio and\nI come down here and I look.\n\n86\n00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:55.847\nHm, so here's controls and hm.\n\n87\n00:04:55.847 --> 00:05:01.790\nThere's clone nodes, so interesting.\n\n88\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.460\nClone nodes, that might be something here.\n\n89\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.970\nSo if we again kinda wrap this up and\nlook at audio.\n\n90\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.071\nClone node, what do I get?\n\n91\n00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:19.121\nI get another audio object, so\nand I'll actually clone this, and\n\n92\n00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.650\nget a temporary object.\n\n93\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.390\nNow, in the context of this game,\n\n94\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.160\nI don't have to worry about\nperformance it's a pretty simple game.\n\n95\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.400\nDo keep in mind if you did this,\n\n96\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.800\nit like rapid fire, crazy,\nyou'll be cloning a bunch of nodes,\n\n97\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.150\nwhich could be a CPU, or memory\nperformance concern within the browser.\n\n98\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.098\nBut for us they're kinda gonna get\ngarbage collected pretty quickly.\n\n99\n00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:42.748\nBut do keep in mind you might\nhave to be careful there.\n\n100\n00:05:42.748 --> 00:05:47.506\nI think that might solve\nsomething because instead of\n\n101\n00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:52.157\nusing the same object to\nplay both times I hit Enter,\n\n102\n00:05:52.157 --> 00:05:59.160\nI wanna use this one object this initial\nblaster sound here, right, the pew.\n\n103\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.000\nI come over into the game\nobject the @taggameobject.\n\n104\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.114\nInstead of saying this .sounds .PEW.play I\n\n105\n00:06:10.114 --> 00:06:15.364\nthink if I do something like this,\nclone node.\n\n106\n00:06:15.364 --> 00:06:20.551\nSo I'm going to get a copy of that object,\nright with everything already pre loaded.\n\n107\n00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:24.577\nAnd hit Play and then if I hit play\nRapidFire, I'm going to get a play over\n\n108\n00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:28.430\nhere and a play over here instead\nof a play on a single one, right?\n\n109\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.910\nIt's kind of like the double,\nthis is a horrible example.\n\n110\n00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.752\nYou remember double cassette\ntapes like juke boxes?\n\n111\n00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:34.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:39.229\n&gt;&gt; No, I can't remember but I am\npretty sure I've tried to play both of\n\n113\n00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.993\nthem at the same time and every once\nin a while I could get it to where I\n\n114\n00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:48.267\nwould have like Meatloaf and\nBach playing at the same time.\n\n115\n00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:52.203\nSo, it was creative, well,\nit probably didn't last too long, so\n\n116\n00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.076\nI don't know if I would do that.\n\n117\n00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:57.021\nBut that's a horrible example cuz I'm not\neven sure that everybody is like yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.771\n&gt;&gt; There might be a few\npeople going cassettes.\n\n119\n00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah what is a cassette.\n\n120\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.090\n&gt;&gt; They make a funny\nnoise if you shake them.\n\n121\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\npull that stuff out of the center and\n\n122\n00:07:04.534 --> 00:07:06.924\nyou have to wind that\nback up with a pencil.\n\n123\n00:07:06.924 --> 00:07:10.328\nBut I think by getting that copy it's\nessentially like I have two radios\n\n124\n00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:11.130\nplaying right?\n\n125\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.610\nI can play different things.\n\n126\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.601\nOr if you have the car radio on but\nyou have your phone or\n\n127\n00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:22.012\nan MP3 player and\nyou're playing different music, right.\n\n128\n00:07:22.012 --> 00:07:27.463\nThey might have the same song available,\nbut you can play them at the same time and\n\n129\n00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:30.840\nthey may be at different time intervals,\nright?\n\n130\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.538\nSo I think this is gonna work.\n\n131\n00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:35.274\nCross your fingers, Zach we'll see.\n\n132\n00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:39.407\nAnd don't save, it should actually reload.\n\n133\n00:07:39.407 --> 00:07:40.267\nAnd you have to click.\n\n134\n00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:41.602\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n135\n00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:45.581\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n136\n00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.186\n&gt;&gt; Ha, so now I've got-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n137\n00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:48.755\n&gt;&gt; A rapid fire pew.\n\n138\n00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:49.956\nPew, pew, pew.\n\n139\n00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.757\nSo that, that fix then,\nI'm good with that.\n\n140\n00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:54.389\nI'm not gonna turn\nthe background noise back on.\n\n141\n00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.128\nBut let's go see what are some\nother things that I have.\n\n142\n00:07:58.128 --> 00:08:03.780\nNow I'm thinking that\nwhen a pellet collides,\n\n143\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.310\nif I come over here and I look,\n\n144\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.419\nI have this explode.mp3 [SOUND], right?\n\n145\n00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:19.471\nSo that would be a nice fallback,\nlike a nice little indicator.\n\n146\n00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:23.860\nSo if I come down here and I look,\nI look back through my code.\n\n147\n00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:28.820\nPellets for\neach if the swarm gets hit by the pellet.\n\n148\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.930\nOkay, let's go check that\nget hits by the pellet.\n\n149\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:40.805\nSo if I come over to the swarm,\ngets hit by, and then, well,\n\n150\n00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:46.360\nthat means that one of\nthe attackers would have been hit.\n\n151\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.580\nSo I can actually put it there\nwithout having to pass it down.\n\n152\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.980\nAnd I think I'm gonna do that, but\nI could make this part of the swarm and\n\n153\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.860\nhave the swarm maintain all of its\nown sounds and things like that.\n\n154\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.600\nBut because of this game object,\nit's kind of watching over and\n\n155\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.690\nbeing the overseer, so to speak,\nI'm gonna keep it here.\n\n156\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.740\nNow, that does mean that\nthe sounds object needs to\n\n157\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.350\nbe change over in app, and\nI also need to load a new sound.\n\n158\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.314\nSo, let's loadAudio and\n\n159\n00:09:21.314 --> 00:09:29.730\n./fx/explode.mp3, like so.\n\n160\n00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:35.787\nAll right, and that means that right\nhere I have an explosion sound.\n\n161\n00:09:35.787 --> 00:09:38.970\nAll right,\nlet's see if that explosion sound\n\n162\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.946\nactually makes a noise first before cuz\nI wanna make sure that it plays and\n\n163\n00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:48.090\nit's what I expect before I\ntry to go wiring up things.\n\n164\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.359\nSo if I come here and\nto say explosion.play(),\n\n165\n00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:57.516\nand look, yeah, there it is, [SOUND].\n\n166\n00:09:57.516 --> 00:09:59.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was a little rougher to make.\n\n167\n00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:00.824\nSo okay.\n\n168\n00:10:00.824 --> 00:10:05.011\nSo let's call this boom, and\n\n169\n00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:10.260\nthat's the explosion sound.\n\n170\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.460\nAnd part of the reason I arranged\nit this way is to show you, hey,\n\n171\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.045\nI can bundle these up and\nrename them and provide some context.\n\n172\n00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:20.270\n&gt;&gt; Mister I have a question.\n\n173\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.360\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n174\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.180\n&gt;&gt; So can you double up on the sound?\n\n175\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.834\nLike when I hear the [SOUND],\nit seemed kind of muted, right?\n\n176\n00:10:27.834 --> 00:10:28.960\nYou probably did that on purpose.\n\n177\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.380\nBut can you double up on the sound\nto make it more amplified.\n\n178\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.680\n&gt;&gt; So actually that's interesting.\n\n179\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.855\nWe can give it a try, right?\n\n180\n00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:42.492\n[SOUND] Right, and\nwe may try some other things.\n\n181\n00:10:42.492 --> 00:10:47.870\nWe will try that once we get this\nkind of over into the AmmoAttack.\n\n182\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.090\nSo if I come over here,\n\n183\n00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.740\nthis sound object is actually being\npass into the game object now.\n\n184\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.050\nAnd I came back to main and sounds here.\n\n185\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.900\nSo when this gets hit by, right?\n\n186\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.048\nWhen this gets hit by,\nlike so, then I want to say\n\n187\n00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:09.080\nthis.sounds.BOOM.play, like so.\n\n188\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n189\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.930\n&gt;&gt; So lets see that and then we'll try\nyours by just duplicating it, right?\n\n190\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.150\nBy doing a clone node and\ngetting twice as many.\n\n191\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:21.260\nAnd we'll do a little bit of\nplaying around here with this one.\n\n192\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.160\nSo if we refresh.\n\n193\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.450\nI missed.\n\n194\n00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:33.290\nSo [LAUGH] that's fun, that's fun.\n\n195\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.400\nBut now let's try your idea Zach.\n\n196\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.330\nSo I know that if I call play like this,\nthat's not\n\n197\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.030\ngonna change anything because I'm actually\nkind of playing on the same object and\n\n198\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.290\none is already playing, all right?\n\n199\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.760\nSo I'm gonna use that clone node trick.\n\n200\n00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:53.911\nLike so, and see if I can get two,\nkind of rapid fire,\n\n201\n00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:59.915\n[SOUND] and see if it changes\nmaybe the volume or the effect..\n\n202\n00:11:59.915 --> 00:12:05.755\n[SOUND] And\ndoesn't really sound much different.\n\n203\n00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:06.580\n&gt;&gt; Not much different.\n\n204\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:08.690\nBut it is louder.\n\n205\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.802\n&gt;&gt; It is a little bit louder, right?\n\n206\n00:12:10.802 --> 00:12:13.710\nNow, [COUGH] but that brings up\nan interesting point, right?\n\n207\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:18.360\nI would modify this, and I think we talked\nabout that a little bit in part one.\n\n208\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.138\nLet's, just for giggles because\nmaybe I wanna bring really,\n\n209\n00:12:24.138 --> 00:12:27.860\nlet's see if we can modify\nthe volume of this in situ.\n\n210\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, we did mention that before.\n\n211\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.240\n&gt;&gt; Let's bring this up just to\nsee how this volume works out.\n\n212\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.440\nNow full disclosure, I pre processed\nthese, brought up the game,\n\n213\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.380\nI'm not sure if this is going\nto change anything, but\n\n214\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.500\nit's kind of an in situ to experiment,\nso to speak.\n\n215\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.620\nSo let's do this, actually I probably\n\n216\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:57.353\nneed to do that prior to\nputting these in here.\n\n217\n00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:02.196\nCuz otherwise every time I may be\nadding volume to the sound but\n\n218\n00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:06.510\nyou know what,\nwe'll just put it right here.\n\n219\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:12.410\nSo we call play, but before we call\nplay let's call this.sounds.BOOM.volume.\n\n220\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.670\nAnd let's turn it all the way up,\nwhich is 1, right?\n\n221\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.166\nSo it goes from 0 to 1, 0 being nothing.\n\n222\n00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:19.411\n&gt;&gt; Right you mentioned that before, yeah?\n\n223\n00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:21.100\n&gt;&gt; 1 being the maximum.\n\n224\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.650\nNow, again,\nI'm not sure what the default is,\n\n225\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.090\nbecause that's not part of\nthe documentation that I see.\n\n226\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.300\nIt might be in this somewhere,\nbut let's go see.\n\n227\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.010\nWe refresh.\n\n228\n00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:37.890\nSo, looks like it was\nalready at it's loudest.\n\n229\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I would have to go back and\n\n230\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.530\npre-process this.\n\n231\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.670\nSo because of that,\nI'm gonna take that out, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.080\nBut if you do know that\nmaybe some reason that it's\n\n233\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.430\nnot at it's loudest volume is something\nthat you can modify on an audio object.\n\n234\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.290\nSo I got boom, I got pew,\nI got my background music.\n\n235\n00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.750\nWhat else do I have?\n\n236\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.800\nWell, I have my game over.\n\n237\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.526\nNow I just want to make sure\nthat the sound is in there and\n\n238\n00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.471\nit actually plays, right?\n\n239\n00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:14.370\nBut I'm gonna have to do some other work\nto figure out when the game over occurs.\n\n240\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.510\nSo let's go ahead and bring that in,\nmake sure that the sound plays and\n\n241\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.460\nthen we'll see how this comes to fruition.\n\n242\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.650\nYes, I do have a slight smirk on my face.\n\n243\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do.\n\n244\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.060\n&gt;&gt; This one's fun.\n\n245\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.660\nI think it's fun.\n\n246\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.840\nIt was fun for me to make anyway.\n\n247\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:38.312\nSo ./fx/game-over,\nI think that's what I called it, mp3.\n\n248\n00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:43.680\nAll right, so that was explosion and\nthis is game over.\n\n249\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.289\nSo let's just try it here,\ngameOver.play, like so.\n\n250\n00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:55.580\nHey, it played.\n\n251\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very nice.\n\n252\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.030\n&gt;&gt; That one was pretty fun.\n\n253\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.550\nNow, I don't need it in\nthis main setup process.\n\n254\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.610\nI need it inside of the game object.\n\n255\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:14.760\nSo, Zach, so I went pew, boom,\nwhat's kind of a shorter game over?\n\n256\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.740\nAnd actually, this is the negative one,\nthis is if you lose, right?\n\n257\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.740\nThere's more or less,\nthere's not a lot of winning, so to speak.\n\n258\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.048\nTotally forgot, didn't I?\n\n259\n00:15:26.048 --> 00:15:27.162\nOops.\n\n260\n00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:30.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's see here.\n\n261\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.042\nLet's say lose.\n\n262\n00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.740\nJust to convey an appropriate meaning,\nso gameOver.\n\n263\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say sorry,\nwa, wa, wa.\n\n264\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.291\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wa, wa, wa!\n\n265\n00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:48.292\nThat one would be good,\nactually let's go with wa.\n\n266\n00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:53.920\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Is that how I would spell [SOUND]?\n\n267\n00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [SOUND].\n\n268\n00:15:56.536 --> 00:16:00.356\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've now passed\nthat over, we have the sounds.\n\n269\n00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:03.491\nAnd let's just make sure\nthat that actually plays,\n\n270\n00:16:03.491 --> 00:16:08.490\nthat I've passed it over, and I think this\nwill be a good time to kinda tidy this up.\n\n271\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.060\nCuz, essentially, it's kind of rinse and\nrepeat after this, but\n\n272\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.460\nin order to get this game over\nsound to work appropriately, well,\n\n273\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.130\nwe gotta establish,\nwhat is game over, right?\n\n274\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.990\nWhen do you win and when do you lose?\n\n275\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.850\nAnd really, I think, and\nhomage to some of these older retro games,\n\n276\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.060\nyou didn't really win as\nlike you're at the end.\n\n277\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:36.180\nIt was more like next level,\nnext level, next level, next level.\n\n278\n00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.080\nSo we could do that to\nwhere if there's no more,\n\n279\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.730\ncreate a new swarm boom start it up again.\n\n280\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.810\nAnd now create a new swarm and modify.\n\n281\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.020\nWill they move just a little bit faster?\n\n282\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.380\nJust a little bit faster.\n\n283\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.420\nJust a little bit faster.\n\n284\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.445\nBut, this is just for funzies, right?\n\n285\n00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:52.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:58.581\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI think just upon construction,\n\n287\n00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:04.170\nI'll just say this.sounds.wawawa.play\n&gt;&gt; Just\n\n288\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.330\nto make sure that comes across\nappropriately, and it does.\n\n289\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.730\nAnd there it goes.\n\n290\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.707\nSo, we have our sound set up.\n\n291\n00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:15.617\nWe've actually set it up for\nshooting our blaster, fighter shooting,\n\n292\n00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:19.720\nthe enemies being hit, some background\nmusic, which I've turned off.\n\n293\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.279\nBecause, well, it's annoying to\ntalk over during this episode.\n\n294\n00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:28.418\nWhat we need to do is may be come back\nbecause l know it's gonna take a chunk of\n\n295\n00:17:28.418 --> 00:17:31.334\ntime and\nfigure out what are the game overs, right.\n\n296\n00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:33.489\nWhat are the game mover metrics?\n\n297\n00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:40.850\nI'm thinking, once the swarm hit\nthe fighter, if there was a swarm to left.\n\n298\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:47.160\nIf there is not, all right,\nthen maybe just put up a, you win,\n\n299\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.660\ninstead of having additional levels and\nthings like that just to make it easier.\n\n300\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.666\nReally, if you wanted to\nmake this full fledged,\n\n301\n00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:59.316\nI would probably create a score board,\nand then keep score,\n\n302\n00:17:59.316 --> 00:18:03.912\nand start increase, a level counter,\nadd levels, make the swarm faster.\n\n303\n00:18:03.912 --> 00:18:08.448\nAt some point the swarm's always gonna win\nbecause you can't shoot fast enough based\n\n304\n00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:09.930\non how fast they get to you.\n\n305\n00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.433\nBut we do have some logic,\nmaybe some changes to the actual swarm and\n\n306\n00:18:13.433 --> 00:18:14.734\nfighter and game logic.\n\n307\n00:18:14.734 --> 00:18:17.010\nSo, I guess we'll be coming\nback in another episode.\n\n308\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.517\nNot necessarily an extension to this part,\nbut another episode to enter game over so\n\n309\n00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.493\nthat we can use that game over sound.\n\n310\n00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:25.256\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that even solves part two.\n\n311\n00:18:25.256 --> 00:18:26.097\nThat's it.\n\n312\n00:18:26.097 --> 00:18:27.981\nAnd make sure you watch part one.\n\n313\n00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:29.288\nNXS part one.\n\n314\n00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:30.430\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n315\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.250\nAnything else you'd like to\nsay before we channel off?\n\n316\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, I just wanna reinforce\nthe fact that these are always\n\n317\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.100\nkind of simple things, where I'm like,\nthis will be kind of cool to make.\n\n318\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.860\nI wanted to convey to you that not\neverything has to be polished and\n\n319\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.880\nslick and absolute best.\n\n320\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.513\nBut it's more about learning and\nexploration.\n\n321\n00:18:49.513 --> 00:18:52.777\nThis is something that if I rewrote\nit three more times I would\n\n322\n00:18:52.777 --> 00:18:54.700\nprobably rewrite it differently.\n\n323\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.260\nI would probably add more features.\n\n324\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.090\nIt's kind of like climbing a ladder but\nyou're afraid of heights.\n\n325\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.485\nSo you get up two rungs and then you're\nlike, this is all I've got today, and\n\n326\n00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:06.382\nthen you come down.\n\n327\n00:19:06.382 --> 00:19:08.902\nAnd then you get up two rungs, and\nyou're like this is all I got today and\n\n328\n00:19:08.902 --> 00:19:09.960\nthen you come down.\n\n329\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.040\nAnd then you get up,\nI think I can go to the rung three, right.\n\n330\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.780\nAnd to some extent, learning this\nstuff is very similar to that,\n\n331\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.060\nuntil you're at the top of\nthe letter all right, the ladder.\n\n332\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.101\nNot the letter, if you're on top of the\nletter you just threw it on the floor and\n\n333\n00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:24.711\nstomped on it.\n\n334\n00:19:24.711 --> 00:19:30.246\nSo do keep that in mind that, not\neverything has to be incredibly polished,\n\n335\n00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:35.920\nor absolutely done in order to be fun,\nand well, worthwhile learning.\n\n336\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.570\n&gt;&gt; And Justin always helps us to see,\nhow being at DevPro is so awesome.\n\n337\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.570\nThank you so much Justin.\n\n338\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.000\nGreat job as always.\n\n339\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.120\nAnd this is HTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n340\n00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.300\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode because it's awesome.\n\n341\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.370\nAnd check out the other\nvideos in our course library.\n\n342\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.750\nHundreds of videos all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n343\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.797\nAnd thank you for watching DEVPRO.TV.\n\n344\n00:19:55.797 --> 00:19:57.700\nAnd tell us whether you\nknow about DEVPRO.TV.\n\n345\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.270\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n346\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.926\nThanks for watching.\n\n347\n00:19:59.926 --> 00:20:00.684\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n348\n00:20:00.684 --> 00:20:01.612\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:18.250\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.490\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with HTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n5\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.290\nThis will be ending the game and\nour IT and DevPro expert, Justin Dennison,\n\n6\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.310\nis here to tell us what that all means.\n\n7\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.500\nJustin, good to see you, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.960\n&gt;&gt; It is good to be back in the studio.\n\n9\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.890\nAnd how are you today, Zach?\n\n10\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited.\n\n11\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.050\nThis is almost the end, isn't it?\n\n12\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.291\n&gt;&gt; It is almost the end.\n\n13\n00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.441\n&gt;&gt; Of our Adamo.\n\n14\n00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Adamo attack.\n\n15\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we kind of left off.\n\n16\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.765\nWe added some sounds, but there's actually\na sound for a game over if you lose.\n\n17\n00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:48.330\nBut we don't have any way to\ndetermine when a game over is.\n\n18\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.808\nSo I think that's probably the next\nbusiness, right, or next steps.\n\n19\n00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:58.651\nAnd I wanna set the scene just\nto provide some context here.\n\n20\n00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.244\nAnd I think I said this in a previous\nepisode, a lot of these older games,\n\n21\n00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.660\nthese kind of retro style games,\nyou never won like there was an end.\n\n22\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.433\nYou just kept playing until you lost.\n\n23\n00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.710\nSo you could come back and add that.\n\n24\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.286\nNow I may add something very simple about,\nwell,\n\n25\n00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:21.755\nwhen the swarm's gone,\nyou just have a you win.\n\n26\n00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:26.510\nBut I didn't go too deep into that and\nforgot to record the sound.\n\n27\n00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.700\nBut it was kind of the impetus, as I was\nlike, you never really win at these games.\n\n28\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.930\nYou just go to the next level and they\nget harder until you get a high score.\n\n29\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.680\nSo your high score's determined\nby when did you lose instead of,\n\n30\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.060\nI got to the end of this style of game.\n\n31\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.200\nSo we're more focused on when do you lose,\nwhich is kind of negative in nature.\n\n32\n00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.834\nBut we may,\njust as a simple knowing when you're won,\n\n33\n00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:55.240\nbecause ultimately how\nit'd probably come back.\n\n34\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.447\nIf I was going to extend this and\nsay, now I'm gonna make levels.\n\n35\n00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:03.520\nAnd by levels, I'm just gonna change,\ngotta keep track of score,\n\n36\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.970\nwhat level it is, and\nhow fast the swarm itself is moving.\n\n37\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.310\nSo that's kinda my impetus there.\n\n38\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.380\n&gt;&gt; So I have a question for you.\n\n39\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.772\nNow I know you recorded the sounds that\nwe've heard so far, and they're wonderful.\n\n40\n00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:16.730\n[LAUGH] I love them all.\n\n41\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.290\nBut would there ever be\na time when you could find\n\n42\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.190\nsounds from a sound library online?\n\n43\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nsomething that I would forewarn you about,\n\n44\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.850\nespecially if you're just playing around.\n\n45\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850\nYou get some leeway there.\n\n46\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.790\nLook at the licensing terms for\nthose sounds.\n\n47\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.290\nIf they're creative commons, or\nthey're a very open license.\n\n48\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.300\nAnd where it gets real tricky\nis if they're an open license\n\n49\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.096\nunless you're commercializing,\nsomething like that, right?\n\n50\n00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:47.315\nIt's free to use unless it's commercial,\nand then you owe us royalties.\n\n51\n00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.660\nSo any sound will work.\n\n52\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.490\nThe reason I recorded is, number one,\n\n53\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.150\nI don't have to worry\nabout licensing issues.\n\n54\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.490\nThey're mine, it's my voice.\n\n55\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.672\nNow I guess someone could make\nthe argument that they own the rights to\n\n56\n00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:03.735\ncertain soundlike things, but\nI'm not sampling from like a music or\n\n57\n00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:05.012\nanything like that.\n\n58\n00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:07.140\nI'm just making sounds up.\n\n59\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.570\nSo that was kind of my impetus for them.\n\n60\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.187\nBut you can very well use sounds as long\nas they're the appropriate format for\n\n61\n00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:14.972\nplaying, so good question.\n\n62\n00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:20.650\nLet's actually take a look and do a quick\nplan out of where this is going to end.\n\n63\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.020\nSo here's my app, so\nthis is loading all of my assets.\n\n64\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.188\nAnd I create the sounds object and\nI pipe it through to Adamo attack.\n\n65\n00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:33.821\nNow I'm leaving this\ngame play audio.play off,\n\n66\n00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:39.270\nmainly because it's fun to play, but\nwhen I'm trying to explain things,\n\n67\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.955\nit's just playing in the background and\na little bit annoying.\n\n68\n00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:46.544\nI know I just called\nmy own voice annoying.\n\n69\n00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:47.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n70\n00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:49.459\nit's because if I made\na copy of myself and\n\n71\n00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.419\nthen just stood right here behind me\nin the same frame and just went [NOISE]\n\n72\n00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.468\nthe whole time, that would be annoying,\nregardless if it's me or not.\n\n73\n00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:59.670\n&gt;&gt; But annoying in a good way.\n\n74\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, annoying,\nif there is such a thing.\n\n75\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.680\nI don't know.\n\n76\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.182\nThere's two of me, all right.\n\n77\n00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:06.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n78\n00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:09.900\nwe can always turn them back on\nwhen we want someone to play.\n\n79\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.540\nBut if I come over to the actual\nAdamo Attack object, right?\n\n80\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.790\nOkay, let's see here.\n\n81\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.387\nThere may be some tweaking\nthat we have to do.\n\n82\n00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:22.960\nWe don't need any events.\n\n83\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.140\nHandleKeyboard event, that's fine.\n\n84\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.520\nRendering, that is only for\ndrawing, right?\n\n85\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.090\nIt draws to the screen,\nthat's all it should do.\n\n86\n00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.425\nBut update, update is where\na lot of our logic lives, right?\n\n87\n00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:38.690\nThis.pellets for each, for every pellet.\n\n88\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.540\nIf the swarm gets hit by a pellet,\ndo some stuff.\n\n89\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.840\nIf the pellet is in orbit which means that\nit's outside the scope of the screen,\n\n90\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.010\nthen remove it, right?\n\n91\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.410\nThat way, we can keep track and only have\ntwo pellets at one time on the screen.\n\n92\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.760\nIf the swarm hits the edge of a screen,\nthen drop down, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.850\nAnd then swarm move, and\nthen pellets move, okay.\n\n94\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.860\nNow where is the fighter moving occurring?\n\n95\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.280\nThe little bit of updating here\nis based on keyboard events.\n\n96\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.647\nNow I could, and\nif we come down here to the renders,\n\n97\n00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:12.939\nnotice the fighter is being rendered.\n\n98\n00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.712\nI could probably force that\nto go into update, but\n\n99\n00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:19.476\nit just makes more sense since I'm\nusing keyboard events to control\n\n100\n00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:24.040\nother aspects of the game to be\nin an event handler, so to speak.\n\n101\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.810\nAnd then the actual main method is\nwe run request for animation frame.\n\n102\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.930\nWe update and we render.\n\n103\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.684\nAnd then, we run it again,\nupdate render, update render,\n\n104\n00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:34.226\nupdate render, and\nthat's all we're doing, right?\n\n105\n00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:34.970\nNow what is update?\n\n106\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.690\nThat's where all of our logic takes place,\nall of our decision-making.\n\n107\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.690\nAnd then rendering is paint to the screen.\n\n108\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.428\nSo given that, right,\nwe've kind of built this up over time.\n\n109\n00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:49.848\nI think in update is probably the best\nplace to check, hey, did you lose?\n\n110\n00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:52.790\nAre we done?\n\n111\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.700\nWe may have to change the main\nmethod a little bit, and here's why.\n\n112\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.010\nUpdate may change a game state,\nlike is running, or\n\n113\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.570\nhas not lost, or something like that.\n\n114\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.841\nWe don't want to continue calling\nthe animation if you've lost, right?\n\n115\n00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.400\nSo if you're done, we wanna stop.\n\n116\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.700\nSo we may have to put a conditional\nstatement to only request the next paint\n\n117\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.720\nif you haven't lost yet, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.161\nSo let's just get the idea here, so\n\n119\n00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:29.870\nhere's what I'm thinking.\n\n120\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.503\nI'm thinking that as the swarm\n\n121\n00:06:34.503 --> 00:06:39.847\nmoves right up here at the very top,\n\n122\n00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:46.449\nwe could do something like if this.swarm,\n\n123\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.180\nAnd let's go over here and\nlook at this swarm object here.\n\n124\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.220\nSo gets hit by move, dropdown, hitsEdge.\n\n125\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.080\nHow about, we just say hits?\n\n126\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.221\nNow, we could put this on the fighter and\nsay,\n\n127\n00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:08.810\nthe fighter gets hit by, and\nthe swarm hits this.fighter.\n\n128\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.946\nThen we want to do something.\n\n129\n00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:16.540\nLet's just say console.log and\nwe're going to figure this, Game over.\n\n130\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.240\nAnd then we're going to return here.\n\n131\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.240\nNow this is going to do some weirdness,\nand this is what I'm talking about,\n\n132\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.220\nbecause if I return in this update,\nit's not gonna update the state anymore.\n\n133\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.390\nBut it's also not gonna keep the next\nanimation paint from occurring,\n\n134\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.910\nso we may get some weirdness.\n\n135\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.124\nNow before we can test that, though,\nwe have to write this hits method,\n\n136\n00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:45.341\nand I would probably come back and\nchoose better names by these, right?\n\n137\n00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:51.790\nSo hitsEdge, give it a boundary,\nand let's say hits,\n\n138\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.878\nand let's just call it other, and return.\n\n139\n00:07:56.878 --> 00:07:58.450\nNow let's think about the fighter.\n\n140\n00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.344\nLet's come over here and\nlook at the fighter.\n\n141\n00:08:00.344 --> 00:08:04.364\nThe fighter has an X and\nY within the height.\n\n142\n00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:08.630\nSo we need to see is the right\nhand edge of the swarm.\n\n143\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.770\nDoes it hit, right?\n\n144\n00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:20.160\nAnd actually, we probably need to check\nif any of the fighters, because it may be\n\n145\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.680\nthat I hit the fighter or excuse me, the\nattacker in the swarm, so it's gone now.\n\n146\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.540\nSo I can't use the bounding edge\nof the swarm that I use when it\n\n147\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.310\nhits the boundary.\n\n148\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.780\nI actually need to use\nthe individual attackers.\n\n149\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.500\nSo I want to check to see if any\n\n150\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.150\nof the attackers have come\nin contact with the fighter.\n\n151\n00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.380\nAnd we'll probably have to play\naround with that a little bit.\n\n152\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.460\nThat logic is always rough.\n\n153\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.380\nSo if I come here I have attackers.\n\n154\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.310\nRight?\n\n155\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.671\nSo, let's do this, result or\n\n156\n00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:05.637\nhasHitOther equals false.\n\n157\n00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:10.257\nAnd this.attackers.forEach and\n\n158\n00:09:10.257 --> 00:09:15.339\nforEach attacker within the swarm if,\n\n159\n00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:19.959\nand let's go look at the attacker.\n\n160\n00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:25.165\nHits edge, drop down and so\nwe could make a hit other here,\n\n161\n00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:29.310\nit's other, and\nthen use that as a proxy, and\n\n162\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.370\nI may end up doing that,\nwe may pull that out.\n\n163\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:38.730\nBut for now, let's see here,\nif the attacker,\n\n164\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.566\nlet's do this, if the attackers.\n\n165\n00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:49.000\nSo the attacker's x.\n\n166\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.315\nSo given an attacker I wanna\nsee if the attacker's x is\n\n167\n00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:59.890\ngreater than the fighter's x or\n\n168\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.890\nless than the fighter's x given\nthat the up and down works.\n\n169\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.980\nAll right.\nSo let's work through this.\n\n170\n00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:12.698\nSo if the attacker x is greater than or\nequal to the other's x.\n\n171\n00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:21.587\nAnd the attacker's x plus\n\n172\n00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:28.262\nwidth plus width is less than or\n\n173\n00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:36.960\nequal to actually I need this to be.\n\n174\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.452\nLet's rearrange this.\n\n175\n00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:44.367\nIsInX, so the attacker\n\n176\n00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:49.098\nx is greater than or\n\n177\n00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:54.434\nequal to the other x.\n\n178\n00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:04.635\nOr no, that needs to be an and\n\n179\n00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:09.365\nattacker x plus is less than or\n\n180\n00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:13.928\nequal to other x plus width.\n\n181\n00:11:13.928 --> 00:11:16.430\nSo essentially what I am\ntrying to do is figure out,\n\n182\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.060\nwe will scroll up here a little bit.\n\n183\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.840\nFigure out if we have these two bounce\nI want this to be overlapped and\n\n184\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.960\nthis to be overlapped.\n\n185\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.010\nI wanna see if they're within.\n\n186\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.460\nNow, I have to double check that logic\nit gets me every time, we may have to\n\n187\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.050\ncome back and draw a little bit but\nthat's fine, so that's the x bound.\n\n188\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:39.060\nBut I don't wanna check that, I don't\nwant them to return true ever unless\n\n189\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.947\nthis bottom edge of the attacker,\nis within\n\n190\n00:11:42.947 --> 00:11:48.160\nthe position within the y\nposition of the fighter, right?\n\n191\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.106\nSo, let's say const isInY,\n\n192\n00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:59.590\nand that's the attacker y is\n\n193\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.950\nactually the bottom so\nI need the attackers y plus its height.\n\n194\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:12.750\nPlus attacker height is greater than or\n\n195\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.158\nequal to the other's y.\n\n196\n00:12:16.158 --> 00:12:18.857\nSo essentially [SOUND].\n\n197\n00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:23.803\nAnd I wanna see when the bottom touches\nthe top and I want that to occur here.\n\n198\n00:12:23.803 --> 00:12:31.051\nAll right [COUGH] If isInX and\n\n199\n00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:35.470\nisInY, right?\n\n200\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:43.050\nIf both of those conditions are true,\nthen I want hasHitOther to be\n\n201\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:48.230\ntrue and at the very end of this,\nreturn hasHitOther.\n\n202\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.850\nRight?\nSo,\n\n203\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.590\nif anyone of them hits then boom,\nwe're done.\n\n204\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.570\nOkay?\n\n205\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.740\nNow, we're gonna go figure out if\nI have all my logic right here.\n\n206\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.970\nThis is one of those rough time.\n\n207\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.880\nSo I should get a game over.\n\n208\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:12.520\nAnd just for this, I think I'm going\nto speed up a respective attacker.\n\n209\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.690\nLet's actually make that faster and.\n\n210\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.740\nSo let's see here, uncalled\nreference width is not defined for,\n\n211\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.080\nI have a typo here somewhere, Zach.\n\n212\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.846\nLet's see here, if I go into the swarm,\nattackers forEach,\n\n213\n00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:36.250\nthis down attackers, attackers forEach.\n\n214\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.430\nOkay, let's go over here.\n\n215\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.280\nWhat width is not defined,\nwidth is not defined.\n\n216\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.070\nWidth is not defined.\n\n217\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.960\nDid I grab the wrong?\n\n218\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.160\nThere it is.\n\n219\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.460\nOkay?\nThis is one of those things where\n\n220\n00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.620\nbecause this is.\n\n221\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.850\nLet's go look at what it's telling me.\n\n222\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.350\nThere's my typo.\n\n223\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.090\nSometimes you gotta use your\nChrome web tools to help out.\n\n224\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.730\nI actually just typed width and\nI mean other.width.\n\n225\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.210\nThe other things width.\n\n226\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.500\nAnd in this case, it's the fighter.\n\n227\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.490\nSo if I refresh.\n\n228\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.610\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n229\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.355\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n230\n00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My drop down, it looks like.\n\n231\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.302\n&gt;&gt; That was pretty fast.\n\n232\n00:14:20.302 --> 00:14:23.547\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was pretty fast and\n\n233\n00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:26.152\nI broke something else.\n\n234\n00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:29.410\nSo the swarm, I actually need to change.\n\n235\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.541\nThe swarm's DX because the swarms\nbox isn't moving at the same rate.\n\n236\n00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.530\nSo here, boom, boom.\n\n237\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:45.010\nAnd this actually gives you a glimpse of\nhow one could make this a harder level.\n\n238\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Level it up, yeah.\n\n239\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.890\n&gt;&gt; So, just change those.\n\n240\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.630\nSo let's see if an one of these\nattackers and we should come over here,\n\n241\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:56.810\nwe go to console, and hey,\nso there's our game over.\n\n242\n00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.790\nRight, and notice update,\nnothing else is moving.\n\n243\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.180\nBut notice this game\nover is just blowing up.\n\n244\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.770\nRight?\n\n245\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.050\nIt's ran over 700 times and\nthat's because I have no way,\n\n246\n00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.960\nyou know what I got really lucky.\n\n247\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.470\nThat logic is always tricky and\nI got it on the first try.\n\n248\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.610\nAs far as I know I don't need to do\nextensive testing to see if I can get it\n\n249\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.480\nto move from the right and the left and\nmake sure that those all work.\n\n250\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.710\nBut if I come back over here to main.JS,\n\n251\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.850\nwe will assume that I'm\nabsolutely correct.\n\n252\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.900\nThat's a horrible assumption.\n\n253\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.630\nBut, here, I'm just returning from update.\n\n254\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:41.422\nUpdate doesn't, it says return,\nrender, request animation frame.\n\n255\n00:15:41.422 --> 00:15:42.610\nAll right.\n\n256\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.020\nSo that's saying,\nafter you run this function,\n\n257\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.140\nmake sure you run it again,\nrun it again, run it again.\n\n258\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.205\nWell updates just returning,\nit's not updating anything.\n\n259\n00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:52.714\nIt's also not stopping this\nrequest animation frame.\n\n260\n00:15:52.714 --> 00:15:57.160\nOkay?\n\n261\n00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:03.539\nLet's think about this logic upon\ncreation of the game object, let's say.\n\n262\n00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:08.745\nisPlaying = true, so\nisPlaying is true, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:08.745 --> 00:16:14.627\nSo isPlaying is true, and\nthen if I come down here and\n\n264\n00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:22.024\nthis console.log,\nthis isPlaying = false, all right?\n\n265\n00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:31.134\nSo this.isPlaying,if[this.isPlaying],\n\n266\n00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:37.140\nthen request the next frame.\n\n267\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.530\nIf the game is still running and\nwe can call this is running or\n\n268\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.240\nsomething like that.\n\n269\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.230\nAnd I come over here and\nI ran and it's still going.\n\n270\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.940\nNow we wanna see if I only\nget one print out here,\n\n271\n00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.450\nnow eventually I would probably move\nthis down, but hopefully this works and\n\n272\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:17:02.570\nI may even speed this up faster just to\ngive things really rolling, and boom.\n\n273\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.000\nIt actually runs twice, okay.\n\n274\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.180\nNow why would it run twice?\n\n275\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:12.670\nI think I'm okay with it running twice\ncuz whats happening is, this queue up\n\n276\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:18.850\nis queuing up the next run before maybe\nI can catch up to determine logic.\n\n277\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.110\nSo I'm okay with that\nlittle big of wiggle.\n\n278\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:27.330\nI don't need the timing mechanism for\nthis game to be absolutely critical.\n\n279\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.140\nNow if you were doing like\na first-person shooter, or\n\n280\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.190\nlots of visualizations, the timing\nmechanism may be a little bit of an issue.\n\n281\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.550\nBut that means that I'm good here,\nwell within my eyes.\n\n282\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.960\nAgain, I could probably move this over and\nI could, you know what?\n\n283\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.190\nLet's just try something.\n\n284\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.790\nLet's update.\n\n285\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.830\nAnd now I'm not queueing up first.\n\n286\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.160\nNow for performance reasons,\n\n287\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.910\nthere's times where you always want\nto queue the animation frame up top.\n\n288\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.340\nSo if I refresh and\nactually let me speed this up.\n\n289\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.580\nLet's turn it up to 11.\n\n290\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.890\nAnd if you know what that's\na reference from, congratulations.\n\n291\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.740\nSo if I refresh,\nyeah this is the part in the game,\n\n292\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.640\nyou remember how I said some of these\nnostalgic games, you're never gonna win.\n\n293\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.360\nI can't shoot pellets fast enough to lose.\n\n294\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.300\nRight, game over and just that little\nswitch, game over runs one time now\n\n295\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.920\nbecause I'm only queuing up if\nit's not a game over, okay?\n\n296\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.190\nSo that little bit of switch of logic,\nthat's perfectly fine and\n\n297\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.520\nto some extent I could come over here and\nwait for it.\n\n298\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.220\nI could probably say only do this\npart if you're still playing.\n\n299\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.940\nOnly keep everything in line, but\ndon't do an update and render.\n\n300\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.640\nBut the problem that I have with that is\nif I want to render something finally to\n\n301\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:55.112\nthe screen, right,\nthen I probably shouldn't,\n\n302\n00:18:55.112 --> 00:19:00.565\nprobably should keep the render always\nrunning, at least for the final time.\n\n303\n00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:05.670\nOkay, so this console.log('Game over!'),\nthat's fine.\n\n304\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.044\nI don't really need this part, all right?\n\n305\n00:19:09.044 --> 00:19:10.762\nConsole, you don't wanna put that.\n\n306\n00:19:10.762 --> 00:19:19.383\nI'm thinking this.sounds.WAWAWA.play,\n\n307\n00:19:19.383 --> 00:19:21.109\nlike so.\n\n308\n00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:26.994\nAnd also I'm gonna change\nsomething in the render.\n\n309\n00:19:26.994 --> 00:19:32.201\nSo if this if not\n\n310\n00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:38.190\nthis.isPlaying.\n\n311\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.430\nSo if it's game over,\nI guess I could have just said game over.\n\n312\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.210\nBut sometimes that messes up the logic for\nme.\n\n313\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.650\nSo if not this.isPlaying,\n\n314\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:54.350\nthen I can say this.context, and\nI always have to look this up.\n\n315\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.240\nLet's look up 2D drawing context.\n\n316\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.880\nAnd I think it's fillText but\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n317\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.430\nSo we come over here and\nwe go to fill text,\n\n318\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.100\nthere it is, where's it is,\nthe x and the y, and\n\n319\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.842\nI do know this is weird positioning,\nI may not get crazy about that.\n\n320\n00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:20.620\nSo fillText, and\n\n321\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:26.550\nthat was the text, Game Over.\n\n322\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.800\nAnd then let's put that in\nthe middle of the screen.\n\n323\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.596\nWidth divide by two, and\n\n324\n00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:42.404\nthen jump my cursor up there.\n\n325\n00:20:42.404 --> 00:20:46.206\nThis.screen.height divided by 2.\n\n326\n00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:48.186\nThere we go.\n\n327\n00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:53.390\nNow, we're gonna probably see that\nthat's actually a corner of the text,\n\n328\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.538\nbut let's see.\n\n329\n00:20:54.538 --> 00:20:55.408\nHere we go.\n\n330\n00:20:55.408 --> 00:21:00.064\nAll right so we're running, we're running,\nwe should hear the [SOUND].\n\n331\n00:21:00.064 --> 00:21:03.303\nWait for it, wait for it, wait for\nit, wait for it, wait for it.\n\n332\n00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.265\n[SOUND].\n\n333\n00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.715\nBut it didn't render the Game Over,\nall right, so\n\n334\n00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:13.299\nwe've got one little thing to fix,\nbut our [SOUND] actually played.\n\n335\n00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:16.669\nSo we have all of our sounds\nthat I've made for the game,\n\n336\n00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:19.540\nactually working where they should.\n\n337\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.752\nNow the question is why\nisn't that rendering?\n\n338\n00:21:22.752 --> 00:21:26.750\nAnd let's go make sure that\nmy logic's working out here.\n\n339\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.879\nSo update then render, and\n\n340\n00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:36.041\nlet's just see if this\nportion is rendering.\n\n341\n00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:41.576\nSo console.log here, all right, so run,\n\n342\n00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:49.120\nrun, run and wait for it,\nwait for it, wait for it.\n\n343\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.560\nSo it runs that portion.\n\n344\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.060\nYou know what?\n\n345\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.294\nI bet I didn't change the fill style and\nthe text style, so\n\n346\n00:21:57.294 --> 00:22:03.962\nit's not big and it may actually still\nbe the same color as the background.\n\n347\n00:22:03.962 --> 00:22:11.250\nSo it's writing text that is not black,\nor whatever color you decide to have it.\n\n348\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:17.928\nSo let's do this, this.context.save(); and\n\n349\n00:22:17.928 --> 00:22:22.634\nthis.context.restore(); and\n\n350\n00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:27.650\nthis.context.fillStyle 'red'.\n\n351\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:34.500\nAnd what is that property for text size?\n\n352\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.300\nFont, there we go.\n\n353\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.690\nAnd I will just make it my favorite font.\n\n354\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:45.230\nComic Sans MS, and that should be size and\n\n355\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.780\nthen font value, so this.context.font =,\n\n356\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.130\nlet's go to 48 pixels Comic Sans MS.\n\n357\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.177\nI think Comic Sans is okay in a game,\n\n358\n00:22:57.177 --> 00:23:02.200\nI don't know if I would necessarily use\nthat in any type of professional context.\n\n359\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.971\nSo if I run, yeah,\nlet me see if I can, and\n\n360\n00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:10.720\nactually, yeah, so that all still worked.\n\n361\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.330\nAnd we've got some problems here.\n\n362\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.370\nSo that runs, that runs.\n\n363\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.980\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, in the render function\nis the rest of that code running?\n\n364\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.620\n&gt;&gt; You know what, Zack.\n\n365\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.810\nI think you might be onto something here.\n\n366\n00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.540\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen and if we're not playing,\n\n367\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.270\ndon't run this.\n\n368\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.580\nBut that doesn't mean don't run\nthis in the opposite context.\n\n369\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.910\nSo let's say if we aren't playing.\n\n370\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.113\nIf we surround this in else, that'll work,\nbut you know there's quick test because if\n\n371\n00:23:43.113 --> 00:23:47.910\nZach's right after I do all of this, like\nfillText the stuff, I immediately clear\n\n372\n00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.135\nthe rack, I wipe over it, whoops.\n\n373\n00:23:53.135 --> 00:23:57.950\nSo that was a whoopsie daisy on my part,\nso I'm going-\n\n374\n00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.688\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moment.\n\n375\n00:23:58.688 --> 00:23:59.341\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n376\n00:23:59.341 --> 00:24:01.143\nNow I'm going to put a return here,\n\n377\n00:24:01.143 --> 00:24:04.157\nI may come back and\ndo an L statement just to keep the return.\n\n378\n00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:07.677\nBut this is fine for something like this.\n\n379\n00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:11.566\nAnd what they should do is stop the render\nfunction if the game's over from\n\n380\n00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:16.840\nclearing the rectangle and re-rendering\npellets and fighters and things like that.\n\n381\n00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.500\nAnd what that also means is it\nkinda freezes everything in place.\n\n382\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.760\nSo let's go ahead and boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n383\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.470\nWe'll see if Zach was right.\n\n384\n00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.900\nAnd we're working here, and there we go.\n\n385\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.100\nWe now have a game over.\n\n386\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.540\nNow one quick aside.\n\n387\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.340\nThis game over, it's on the right.\n\n388\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.580\nI'm okay with that.\n\n389\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.730\nIf you wanted this to\nbe perfectly centered,\n\n390\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.650\nthen you're gonna have to\noffset the position of this.\n\n391\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:51.870\nI think, let's see,\nif this is 48 pixels in size,\n\n392\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.790\nyou can't do that, I lied.\n\n393\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.340\nYou would have to figure out\nan appropriate measurement to figure out\n\n394\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.950\nhow big the box is for the given\nlength of message, find half that,\n\n395\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.690\noffset it and figure that part out.\n\n396\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.100\nSo, it can be done,\nit's not ultimately to me,\n\n397\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.650\nbut if it bothers you,\nthen definitely check that out.\n\n398\n00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:20.130\nBut, Zach, I look at this,\nand other than the fact\n\n399\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.412\nthat I can never win at this [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:25.799\n&gt;&gt; I can't win.\n\n401\n00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:29.020\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; So now here's what I wanna do at\n\n402\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.110\nthis point, I would probably just go\nup no more and start over, right?\n\n403\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.939\nCreate a new swarm, do it again.\n\n404\n00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:43.530\nAnd in order to do that I think\ninstead of passing the swarm in,\n\n405\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:49.110\nI would probably create swarm internal\nto the game like move this around.\n\n406\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.960\nAnd so, so here's how I create a swarm.\n\n407\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:59.800\nI would probably now passing the sprites\ncreate that the objects internally and\n\n408\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.710\nthen we're just creating the game.\n\n409\n00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.470\nSo that, that's.\n\n410\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.110\nI wanted to leave a few challenges,\nbecause these are, these are fun.\n\n411\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.740\nHowever, let's see if I\ncan get multiple sounds.\n\n412\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.780\nI'm gonna turn this down.\n\n413\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.570\nLet's see if all of these sounds work.\n\n414\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.870\nNow I'm gonna fire and\ntry to hit a couple of these.\n\n415\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.570\nLet it, let it do its thing.\n\n416\n00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.310\nAnd I think I should be able to hit them.\n\n417\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.010\nBut see if our game over also still\nworks with our background music playing.\n\n418\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.090\nSo, this is kind of a and\nI'm gonna let you all take it over.\n\n419\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.880\nSo, all right.\n\n420\n00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:36.568\nSo I know all those sounds were\n[SOUND] and boom, there we,\n\n421\n00:26:36.568 --> 00:26:41.321\nbut why is the background\nsound still playing?\n\n422\n00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:44.000\nWell, it's not internal.\n\n423\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.810\nAs I turn on with Siri.\n\n424\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.980\nIt's not internal to the game.\n\n425\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.310\nNow, actually I'm gonna fix that real\nquick because that does bother me.\n\n426\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.960\nThe game over message doesn't\nbother me but that does bother me.\n\n427\n00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.985\nSo what I would do is I would\nsay gamePlayAudio.loop true but\n\n428\n00:27:02.985 --> 00:27:05.958\nlet's just call this background.\n\n429\n00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:10.700\nLike so, gamePlayAudio.\n\n430\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.035\nI'm gonna pass this in\nto the construction.\n\n431\n00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:17.750\nAnd I come over here and\nnow I have sounds and\n\n432\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.230\nI'm gonna say this.sounds.BACKGROUND.play.\n\n433\n00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:26.215\nSo, that will get kicked off but\nwhen I'm done.\n\n434\n00:27:26.215 --> 00:27:30.030\nRight?\nWhen I get to here, and\n\n435\n00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.470\nI know this is game over, wait for it.\n\n436\n00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.970\nWhere's my game over?\n\n437\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.240\nThere we go.\n\n438\n00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.135\nThen I want to say\nthis.sounds.BACKGROUND.stop.\n\n439\n00:27:41.135 --> 00:27:43.280\nAnd it's stop.\n\n440\n00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.745\nLet's test it down one more time.\n\n441\n00:27:44.745 --> 00:27:50.106\n[SOUND] All right, so that one works.\n\n442\n00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:54.961\n[SOUND] Stop it's not a function,\n\n443\n00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.675\nI messed up I do need to turn that off.\n\n444\n00:27:59.675 --> 00:28:01.700\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging.\n\n445\n00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, live action debugging,\nright at the very end.\n\n446\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.390\nSo if I refresh not that,\nrefresh this so we can turn that off.\n\n447\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.570\nSo we're gonna go back a little bit and\n\n448\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.640\nI think I might have just\ncalled the wrong method name.\n\n449\n00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.060\nSo stop loop played, so that's the audio,\n\n450\n00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:27.220\naudio, and I need some methods examples.\n\n451\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.940\nSo that's the audio tag.\n\n452\n00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.156\nLet's see.\n\n453\n00:28:31.156 --> 00:28:36.020\nI don't even know why I'm doing this.\n\n454\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.350\nI can just try it over\nhere in the console.\n\n455\n00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.111\nSo const audio equals new audio.\n\n456\n00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:47.500\nAnd stop is not a function, that's fine.\n\n457\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.820\nWe know that, that happened before.\n\n458\n00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.900\nAnd then stop, let's see, duration,\n\n459\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:01.520\ncontrols, current spec,\nloop Pause hey pause.\n\n460\n00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.130\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n461\n00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:05.280\n&gt;&gt; Maybe pause.\n\n462\n00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.540\nI think pause is probably gonna work\nbest here, cuz I don't see any stop.\n\n463\n00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.730\nStop, stop, stop, stop, stop.\n\n464\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.340\nOkay.\n\n465\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.500\nSo that was my, I always so\nwe're gonna go with play.\n\n466\n00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.090\nAnd we're gonna change this to pause.\n\n467\n00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.670\nAnd we're gonna cross our fingers Zach.\n\n468\n00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.985\nAll right, so this works.\n\n469\n00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:29.874\nAnd, oops.\n[SOUND] All right, so it's working,\n\n470\n00:29:29.874 --> 00:29:31.100\nit's good.\n\n471\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.820\nAnd there we go.\n\n472\n00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.392\nWe have kind of a final game and\nwell this is a setup.\n\n473\n00:29:39.392 --> 00:29:43.500\nYou should take it over, add a scoreboard,\nadd a level counter, change the levels.\n\n474\n00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.070\nAnd you may have to restructure the things\nthat I've done because this is kind of my\n\n475\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.650\nultimate goal when I started out, and\n\n476\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.540\ncode is always kind of ever evolving and\nchanging.\n\n477\n00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.140\nSo you don't have to be married\nto the set up that I have here.\n\n478\n00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.250\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Justin.\n\n479\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.796\nI've enjoyed the heck out of this series,\nand\n\n480\n00:30:00.796 --> 00:30:03.488\nthis is HTML5 Canvas Projects\nending the game.\n\n481\n00:30:03.488 --> 00:30:05.360\nThat's the name of this episode.\n\n482\n00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.640\nJustin, any last words?\n\n483\n00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, just to reiterate.\n\n484\n00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.080\nTake what I have here.\n\n485\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.040\nTake the scaffolding so\nto speak and try a few things out.\n\n486\n00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.480\nTry to break it, see what's wrong with it.\n\n487\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.840\nI can tell you there's probably about\nthree things that if I do this again I\n\n488\n00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.840\nwould probably change things and actually\nI commented about one during this episode.\n\n489\n00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.400\nI would create the swarm upon construction\nof the game instead of creating the swarm\n\n490\n00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.990\nprior to and what that means is I need\nto instead of passing the swarm and\n\n491\n00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.470\nthe fighter passing the respective sprites\nsimilar to what I did with the sounds.\n\n492\n00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.490\nAnd then construct the swarm and\nfighter respectively and\n\n493\n00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.355\nthat's gonna allow me to do level\ncounts and so on and so forth.\n\n494\n00:30:45.355 --> 00:30:49.956\nSo keep that in mind as you go on and\ntry to add some features of your own.\n\n495\n00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Add mode attack, we had a great time.\n\n496\n00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.100\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of HTML5 canvas projects,\n\n497\n00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.600\nalso take a look at the other\nvideos in our course library,\n\n498\n00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.950\nhundreds of them all designed to\ndo one thing, help you go further.\n\n499\n00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.030\nAnd thank you for watching DEVPRO.TV,\ntell everybody you know about DEVPRO.TV,\n\n500\n00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.440\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n501\n00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.087\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n502\n00:31:09.087 --> 00:31:10.595\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt;

It is good to be back Zach and\nthanks for having me in the studio.\n\n9\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.970\nAnd how are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm excited and I'm excited about\nthe new endeavor here, well new to us.\n\n11\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.690\nOf course you could be\nwatching this out of order,\n\n12\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.670\nbut tell us about the DevPaint project.\n\n13\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.470\nWhat is it all about?\n\n14\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.720\n&gt;&gt; Up until this point I've been doing\nsome games and things like that,\n\n15\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.800\nor maybe this is the very first one that\nyou're watching depending on whether\n\n16\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.070\nyou're watching this live, prerecorded,\nor maybe like what is this.\n\n17\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.941\nSo I was thinking I've been doing\nall this with a Canvas right?\n\n18\n00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:03.346\nBut I've never really,\nlike I've done keyboard commands but\n\n19\n00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:08.681\nreally haven't done anything with\nthe mouse other than you can click on it.\n\n20\n00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:12.069\nAnd then I was like one of my favorite\nthings to do when I was younger on\n\n21\n00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.066\nthe computer was to grab out like an old\nMicrosoft Paint and things like that.\n\n22\n00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Sure me too.\n\n23\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.133\n&gt;&gt; And make a bunch of scribble, right?\n\n24\n00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n25\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.727\n&gt;&gt; And then you would fill,\nand I was like,\n\n26\n00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:24.908\nactually that's almost like\na canvas painting, right?\n\n27\n00:01:24.908 --> 00:01:27.084\nDevPaint.\n\n28\n00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:29.350\nI think I can program that.\n\n29\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.780\nSo that was kind of the impetus there.\n\n30\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.920\nLet's build a very reduced\nfunctionality call,\n\n31\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.840\nI'm talking minimal\nviable kind of solution.\n\n32\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090\nI want to be able to change colors.\n\n33\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.810\nI want to be able to maybe get some sizes,\nmaybe save the image, who knows?\n\n34\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.970\nBut, in this episode I think we can flesh\nthat out, get our project set up, and\n\n35\n00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.480\nthat way we could start building, well,\n\n36\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.720\nour very own childhood nostalgia\napplication inside of the browser.\n\n37\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Some more retro fun.\n\n38\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I dunno maybe, I've been\non a huge retro kick here lately.\n\n39\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.990\nBut that's all right.\n\n40\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.570\n&gt;&gt; Everything old is new again, Justin.\n\n41\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.860\n&gt;&gt; If you've watched any\nof the previous projects\n\n42\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.538\nyou'll know that I'm really trying to\ndrive home that we need to plan, right?\n\n43\n00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:20.410\nI say draw, think about how users\nare gonna interact with it, and\n\n44\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.660\nyou may be the only user right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.050\nThis might just be a pet project for you.\n\n46\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.220\nSo we're gonna draw, we're gonna label,\nwe're kinda gonna plan out, set out our\n\n47\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.680\nstructure of our application, and that way\nwe can take those small bites at a time.\n\n48\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.820\nAnd there's limited surprises, instead\nof if you just start coding sometimes\n\n49\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.330\nyou'll just like, this isn't gonna work.\n\n50\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.747\nI've done that, full disclosure,\nI'll sit down [SOUND] and\n\n51\n00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.959\nthen you paint yourself into a corner.\n\n52\n00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.766\nOr you lay down a bunch of\nmouse traps around yourself and\n\n53\n00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.030\nnow you're in a corner.\n\n54\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.750\n&gt;&gt; You paint yourself into\na corner metaphorically.\n\n55\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.693\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, metaphorically.\n\n56\n00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:57.350\nSo, let's go ahead and come over to the\nsky cam and do a little bit of planning.\n\n57\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.942\nA little bit of drawing, so to speak.\n\n58\n00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:04.220\nNow all right, here's what I'm thinking,\nwhen we open the web page,\n\n59\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.120\nwe have something that looks like this.\n\n60\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.270\nNow, if you can think about it.\n\n61\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.830\nEffectively, what I want to build\nis the ability to have a marker and\n\n62\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.875\ndraw on the screen.\n\n63\n00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of a-\n\n64\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.180\n&gt;&gt; Like a hand holding a marker.\n\n65\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.420\n&gt;&gt; This is meta and\n\n66\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.450\nactually I could do that\n&gt;&gt; For now, let's just hold off on that.\n\n67\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.330\nAnd I'm thinking initially, I wanna build\njust the ability to draw, maybe in black.\n\n68\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.110\nThe default.\n\n69\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.000\nBut long-term kind of\na minimal viable solution\n\n70\n00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.940\nbecause there's a bunch of complex things\nyou can do like fills and patterns.\n\n71\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.530\nAnd you can do some of those things, but\nlet's just worry about the interactions\n\n72\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.110\nwith the mouse and a few other\nlike settings that we can have.\n\n73\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.310\nSo I'm thinking like a color\nselector right here.\n\n74\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.662\nColor selector.\n\n75\n00:03:56.662 --> 00:04:03.260\nOkay, so when I click on this,\nI have the ability to select a color.\n\n76\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Change colors, yeah, sounds good.\n\n77\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm thinking maybe like a,\n\n78\n00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.662\nif I just get really frustrated,\nI want a Clear button.\n\n79\n00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:19.550\nAnd then, maybe it's easier,\nyou know what?\n\n80\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.400\nI don't want a button for that.\n\n81\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.040\nMaybe a little slider for size.\n\n82\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.627\n&gt;&gt; Scale, scale button.\n\n83\n00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:28.930\n&gt;&gt; It could be on scale.\n\n84\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.477\nI'm thinking size of the tool,\nlike this is a medium to thick tip marker,\n\n85\n00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:39.450\nbut maybe I could pull this over\nto the left, for thin, right?\n\n86\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.710\n&gt;&gt; For the line itself.\n\n87\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.970\nYeah, that's great.\n\n88\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.103\n&gt;&gt; And then I can pull this over here for\nkind of thicker lines.\n\n89\n00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:51.229\nSo I'd have the ability to have\na bunch of different color lines.\n\n90\n00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.530\nI'd have the ability to have thin and\nthick lines and I can clear.\n\n91\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.260\nNow it's kind of a very\nminimal solution but\n\n92\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.100\nwe'll find out there's a little\nmore to it than [INAUDIBLE].\n\n93\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.700\nI'm pretty sure we're gonna find that out.\n\n94\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.231\nNow, what would happen, and\nlet's draw all this in just a little bit.\n\n95\n00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.570\nLet's say that I picked blue.\n\n96\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.040\nThat means that this color selector,\nI've picked blue, and now as I click and\n\n97\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.210\ndrag, I can make blue scribbles.\n\n98\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.630\nAnd then let's say that I click and\nmake this red.\n\n99\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.430\nSo this is now done and\nthis is red, like so.\n\n100\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.220\nAnd now I can scribble in red and\nso on and so forth.\n\n101\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.470\nAnd this is gonna be a little bit harder.\n\n102\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.780\nBut now let's say that boom,\nI've moved this over here.\n\n103\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.640\n&gt;&gt; And make it a thicker line, right?\n\n104\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.293\n&gt;&gt; And to simulate this,\nwe're still on red, excuse me.\n\n105\n00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:54.558\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n106\n00:05:54.558 --> 00:05:55.396\nWe're on red, yes.\n\n107\n00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:01.210\n&gt;&gt; Let's say I draw that.\n\n108\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.360\nNow I'm scribbling here because I\ndon't have a very fat tipped marker.\n\n109\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.010\nSo now I would have\nthe ability to draw a line.\n\n110\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.075\nWe assume that it's a little more\nuniform than I have drawn it here.\n\n111\n00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.245\nSo there we go.\n\n112\n00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:21.525\nSo that would be kind of thick and\nthin, and I can draw paths.\n\n113\n00:06:21.525 --> 00:06:25.275\nAnd I think that's a good first\napproximation of being able to have this\n\n114\n00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:27.225\npaint facility.\n\n115\n00:06:27.225 --> 00:06:33.605\nI will forewarn you, we're not initially\ngoing to or possibly even at all.\n\n116\n00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:36.225\nI don't think I'm gonna worry about\nlike the paint bucket utility.\n\n117\n00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:40.930\nWhere I could come in here and\nactually click and then fill in between.\n\n118\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.660\nBut also drawing polygons, where if\nI wanted to draw, based on clicks,\n\n119\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.710\na triangle.\n\n120\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.360\nI could click three points and\nit would draw a triangle.\n\n121\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.272\nWe are going to stay away from that for\nnow, mainly because determining if this is\n\n122\n00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:59.350\nbetween two paths, it just takes,\nbelieve it or not, a chunk of math.\n\n123\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.230\n&gt;&gt; Which it does.\n\n124\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:06.760\n&gt;&gt; And the polygons, those might\nbe an extension, but ideally if\n\n125\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.250\nwe have this basic kind of feel, we could\nkeep on adding and adding and adding.\n\n126\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.100\nSo maybe a little simpler than\nsome of the previous projects, but\n\n127\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.460\nit does address mouse clicks and\nkeeping mouse events and\n\n128\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.848\nthings like that,\nthat then respond on to the canvas.\n\n129\n00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:29.426\nSo, that our kind of simplistic view and\nI think it's going to be fairly-\n\n130\n00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:31.210\n&gt;&gt; It's a good plan, I think.\n\n131\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Fairly easy to mess with.\n\n132\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.320\nSo that's what we want to do, and\n\n133\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.370\nnow that we kind of have our plan ready,\nwhat should we do?\n\n134\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.730\nWe should probably do\na little of set up and\n\n135\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.700\nmake sure our project is ready to go, and\nthat way we can take one step at a time,\n\n136\n00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.380\nyou can follow along, and\nwe'll be ready to go.\n\n137\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.010\nSo lets go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n138\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.110\nI have Chrome browser open.\n\n139\n00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.280\nYou should probably use Chrome cuz I'm\ngonna use some of the debugging tools in\n\n140\n00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.190\nsome of the things to show you.\n\n141\n00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.020\nAnd I have Atom,\ntext editor of your choice.\n\n142\n00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.160\n&gt;&gt; I have Atom too.\n\n143\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.290\n&gt;&gt; I recommend Atom, and\nthen I have a folder called DevPaint.\n\n144\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.720\nI just created that folder.\n\n145\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.640\nYou can create a new folder or\nyou can add project folder and\n\n146\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.220\nadd a folder from your computer.\n\n147\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.570\nNow within that folder,\nI'm gonna create these three thoughts.\n\n148\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.675\nAnd we may not need all of them, but\nI always put them there just in case.\n\n149\n00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:34.763\nMain.css, New File, and\nthat's Index.html and\n\n150\n00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:41.205\nthen just to mix it up\nlet's call it paint.js or\n\n151\n00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:49.110\nmore specifically devpaint.js,\njust like that.\n\n152\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.150\nSo change that up then versus\nsome other projects again.\n\n153\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.113\nJust to reinforce, there's nothing\nmagical about these per se.\n\n154\n00:08:56.113 --> 00:09:00.180\nNow there are some conventions,\nthe index.html, a lot of static hosting.\n\n155\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.045\nIf you want to put this on the web,\nthey're going to be looking for\n\n156\n00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:07.560\nindex.html, so it actually makes your\nlife easier to just use index.html.\n\n157\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.382\nSo I want to get rid of this,\nI'm not getting rid of this excuse me.\n\n158\n00:09:13.382 --> 00:09:17.810\nI'm just going to put a console.log,\nhere we go.\n\n159\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.340\nJust like that.\n\n160\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.840\nAnd inside of index.html in Atom,\nyou could type html and hit Enter.\n\n161\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.640\nWell, let's create DevPaint.\n\n162\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.920\nAnd let's create a link\nthat is a style sheet, but\n\n163\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.495\nthat is not the appropriate href.\n\n164\n00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:37.455\n[SOUND] Main, like so, and\n\n165\n00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:41.241\nthen I need a script tag.\n\n166\n00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:46.308\nNow if I go to script source, it doesn't\ndo where I have to backspace and\n\n167\n00:09:46.308 --> 00:09:49.720\nthings like that, so this is dev-paint.js.\n\n168\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.662\nNow, you've watched any of my other\nprojects you'll know this kind of grows as\n\n169\n00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:55.706\nwe need it to be.\n\n170\n00:09:55.706 --> 00:09:57.940\n&gt;&gt; They always do\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n171\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.410\nthat's really how you'd\nattack a project like this.\n\n172\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.030\nSeems simple.\n\n173\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.434\nIt's good to go.\n\n174\n00:10:03.434 --> 00:10:04.422\nMaybe not.\n\n175\n00:10:04.422 --> 00:10:06.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not.\n\n176\n00:10:06.531 --> 00:10:08.320\n&gt;&gt; It might need some reverse engineering.\n\n177\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.120\n&gt;&gt; We'll see.\n\n178\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.217\nSo, let's make sure all of this\nkind of loads like the app.js and\n\n179\n00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:16.915\nthe main.css load onto the page.\n\n180\n00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:17.578\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n181\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:20.070\nsetup our drawing area because\nthe canvas is pretty straight forward.\n\n182\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.289\nThen we'll have our initial project set up\nand then we'll start attacking features.\n\n183\n00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:30.640\nSo this main.css, let's say body.\n\n184\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.470\nZach, favorite color, what is it?\n\n185\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.270\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n&gt;&gt; Blue, let's go see if it works.\n\n186\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.100\nAnd I could serve this up using\na local server or something like that.\n\n187\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.330\nBut since this is just static JavaScript,\nwhat I mean by static is I'm not\n\n188\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.500\nhaving to like make a server request, it's\njust a file that loads into the browser.\n\n189\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.128\nCSS and index.html,\nwe don't need a server for this.\n\n190\n00:10:57.128 --> 00:11:00.490\nSo if we come over to DevPaint and\nI open index.html.\n\n191\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:05.240\nAnd, well there's Zach's blue background,\nthat's actually a lot broader, brighter.\n\n192\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.230\nSee, it's so bright,\nI'm messing up my words.\n\n193\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.260\nAnd then if I open up the console,\nit looks like everything's good to go.\n\n194\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.380\nSo as long as we have that set up,\nwe're ready to move on-\n\n195\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.945\n&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.\n\n196\n00:11:16.945 --> 00:11:18.280\n&gt;&gt; To kind of this next part.\n\n197\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.273\nAnd I'm sorry, Zach,\nI'm gonna remove that blue,\n\n198\n00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:24.570\nbecause it hurts my face,\nit hurts my face a great deal.\n\n199\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.710\n&gt;&gt; You can make it chartreuse if you want.\n\n200\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:32.050\n&gt;&gt; I could make it chartreuse, let's\ngo with light blue, that's not as bad.\n\n201\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.560\n&gt;&gt; No, that's nice sure.\n\n202\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.470\n&gt;&gt; So we'll leave that,\nlet's change the light blue.\n\n203\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.849\nI'm not gonna spend a whole bunch of time\non styling so to speak it's more about\n\n204\n00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.946\nfunctionality but maybe something\na little bit different than white.\n\n205\n00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:48.860\nAlso that will allow us to see the canvas\nhopefully unless things are a little awry.\n\n206\n00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.190\nSo let's go head and build our canvas,\nget a couple other things set up and\n\n207\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.230\nthen we'll be ready to move on,\nso to speak.\n\n208\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.680\nSo, we're gonna create a canvas object,\n\n209\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.130\nand I could do this dynamically\ninside of the JavaScript file.\n\n210\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.930\nI'm just gonna put this plain cuz I\nthink I want this to be fairly fixed\n\n211\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.250\nas far as drawing area.\n\n212\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.290\nWe're not adding,\n\n213\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.090\nhey do you want a different size\ndrawing area or different size?\n\n214\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.205\nNo, no, no,\nwe're gonna keep this fairly simple.\n\n215\n00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:18.690\nLet's see here.\n\n216\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.340\nIf you hit Enter it's going to\ngive you an ID, a width, and\n\n217\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.850\na height in Atom by default,\nif I hit Enter on that drop down.\n\n218\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.050\nI'm going to call this,\nlet's just leave it canvas because\n\n219\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.430\nif we're painting that\nactually makes a lot of sense.\n\n220\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:41.552\nThe width, let's make this a little\nbit bigger, there's 600 and 400.\n\n221\n00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:48.028\nSo I wanna 3 to 2 ratio for\nour width to height.\n\n222\n00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:50.730\nAnd why not?\n\n223\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.460\nI guess I could do 16 by 9.\n\n224\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.470\nI can do giant, but we'll leave that be.\n\n225\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.357\nIf we come over here and we Refresh,\ndoesn't look like anything has happened.\n\n226\n00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Or does it?\n\n227\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.160\n&gt;&gt; And if I inspect it, it has.\n\n228\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.250\nExcept, by default, the canvas, and\n\n229\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.150\nI have it zoomed in a little bit, I'm\nactually gonna zoom in because sometimes,\n\n230\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:19.340\nnot over there though, sometimes it's\nhard to see so I have about 125% zoom.\n\n231\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.440\nAnd if I look at the canvas, we may\nwant to make that a little bigger, but\n\n232\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.940\nwe're going to leave it like that for\nnow, why can't I see it?\n\n233\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.377\nIf I come back to my CSS,\nand I say #canvas,\n\n234\n00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:35.810\nbecause I'm selecting the canvas\nwith the idea of canvas, maybe I\n\n235\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.910\nhave multiple canvases that have different\nthings on the page that they're doing.\n\n236\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.920\nBut this particular one which\nI'm going to be using for\n\n237\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.890\nthe paint, let's create\nthe background color to white.\n\n238\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.900\nAnd I think that will get us, there we go.\n\n239\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.065\nAnd remove this.\n\n240\n00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:55.282\nSo here's our painting fun times.\n\n241\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.006\nAnd now the last little bit,\nlet's go ahead and grab our canvas, and\n\n242\n00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:08.688\nlet's document.querySelector, #canvas.\n\n243\n00:14:08.688 --> 00:14:13.891\nAnd then we'll see here,\nthe context, which is actually what\n\n244\n00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:18.799\ndoes all the drawing and\nrendering, how we manipulate it,\n\n245\n00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:24.240\nis canvas.getContext(\"2d\")\ncontext just like so.\n\n246\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.320\nAnd let's see if this context works,\n\n247\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:35.206\nfilRect for the canvas starting at 0, 0.\n\n248\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.071\nCanvas,width / 2,\n\n249\n00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:48.592\ncanvas.height / 2) as well.\n\n250\n00:14:48.592 --> 00:14:49.838\nThere we go.\n\n251\n00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:52.600\nAnd I've colored the effort.\n\n252\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.878\nSo everything is good to go,\nI have the appropriate references.\n\n253\n00:14:55.878 --> 00:15:00.638\nWe have our design, we have our plan,\nand now what I'd like to do,\n\n254\n00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:05.070\nand I've tried to emphasize this as,\nyou just start simple.\n\n255\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.100\nWe're all set up, we're good to go, and\non the next episode, this has kind of been\n\n256\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.120\na shorter one, but I wanted to make\nsure everybody's on the same page.\n\n257\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.312\nIn the next episode, we actually start\nimplementing some of these small features\n\n258\n00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:20.085\nlike the ability to draw, right?\n\n259\n00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:24.027\nLet's not worry about color or\nanything else initially,\n\n260\n00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:27.250\nbecause as it stands,\nI need to click and drag.\n\n261\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.261\nAnd sometimes those interactions\ncan get a little difficult,\n\n262\n00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.431\nespecially if you need\nto keep track of them.\n\n263\n00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:36.800\nAnd once we get that, then we can\nadd color, then we can add size,\n\n264\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.750\nthen we can, so\nthis kind of builds on top.\n\n265\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.360\nLet's start with something simple and\n\n266\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.300\nwell in the next episode we're gonna learn\nhow to click and drag draw, so to speak.\n\n267\n00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.510\n&gt;&gt; So there will be more of\nthe dev paint project and\n\n268\n00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.070\nthis was planning the dev paint\nproject with Justin Dennison.\n\n269\n00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.590\nJustin, last words sir.\n\n270\n00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Well definitely stay tuned because as I\nsaid, I think we are all going to find out\n\n271\n00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.270\nthis is a little more complicated, or\nmaybe I make it more complicated or\n\n272\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.790\ncomplex, than one would\noriginally have thought.\n\n273\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.245\nAnd you might have learned some nice\nabstraction techniques that you're like\n\n274\n00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:10.991\nI wouldn't have thought of doing that.\n\n275\n00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:15.119\nThat are a little more readable than\nmaybe some other projects that you would\n\n276\n00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:16.160\nhave undertaken.\n\n277\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.200\nWe all start with really messy code.\n\n278\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.460\nMy goal is to help to show you\ndifferent ways to do the same thing.\n\n279\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.140\nSo you can go I like that, that's better.\n\n280\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.630\nAnd give you pluses and minuses.\n\n281\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.860\nSo it seems pretty simple, but\nstay around, you may learn a few things.\n\n282\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.600\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about you but I'm\ninterested to see Justin's inner Picasso\n\n283\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.110\nand that's going to be coming\nup in future episodes.\n\n284\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.390\nSo make sure you watch everything in\nthe HTML 5 Canvas Project series.\n\n285\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.320\nIt's a great series.\n\n286\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.560\nAnd also go to our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there and\n\n287\n00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.080\nthere all designed to help you go further.\n\n288\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.171\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nDevProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n289\n00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:53.000\nThank for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n290\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.780\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n291\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.791\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n292\n00:16:55.791 --> 00:17:03.539\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.966\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and we are\ncontinuing on with HTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n4\n00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:27.010\nAnd I believe we're gonna be learning\nhow to make a Pencil Like Drawing.\n\n5\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.950\nLuckily, we have Justin Dennison\nhere to draw it all out for us.\n\n6\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.730\nHello.\nWelcome.\n\n7\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Well that is the hope and thanks for\nhaving me back in the studio,\n\n8\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.390\nhow are you today Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.401\n&gt;&gt; I'm wonderful how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:41.322\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\nluckily I'm kinda nervous,\n\n11\n00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:43.594\nI'm gonna put that out there.\n\n12\n00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:44.366\nVonne's over here.\n\n13\n00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:48.703\nShe deals with illustrator and\nPhotoshop and all kinds of graphics,\n\n14\n00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:53.450\nI'm probably gonna butcher some of\nthe actual words and vocabulary.\n\n15\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.489\n&gt;&gt; And I'm actually coming off\na whole week of doing Illustrator so\n\n16\n00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.540\nright before this one, so\nI am rip-roaring ready to go for you.\n\n17\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.958\n&gt;&gt; Well, please do be kind,\nplease do be kind and\n\n18\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.212\ncreating a pencil by drawing, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n19\n00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:13.152\nWhere we left off,\nwe'd just set up our project.\n\n20\n00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:13.850\nWe;ve made a basic plan.\n\n21\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.400\nWe're doing something fairly simple.\n\n22\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.900\nAs I told you in the previous episode,\nthis is more about nostalgia.\n\n23\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.650\nIt's about being able to kind\nof draw MS Paint type stop.\n\n24\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.540\nNow, I'm going to use some terminology\nthat lends itself more to a vector thing,\n\n25\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.290\nlike a vector terminology.\n\n26\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.240\nHowever, in the canvas these\nare gonna be bit map graphics.\n\n27\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.205\nSo I wont necessarily get\na full vector representation.\n\n28\n00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.574\nBehind the scenes, my data structures\nare gonna be very vector like.\n\n29\n00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:47.923\nBut that does not mean that I'm\ngonna get vectorized rendering, so\n\n30\n00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:52.300\nto speak, cuz I'm translating\nthose to bit map images.\n\n31\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.250\nNow, with that said, let's go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.470\nsee where we left off and\nwell, where we're going.\n\n33\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.530\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen here and, tell you what,\n\n34\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.970\ndon't judge me based on\nthis light blue background.\n\n35\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.560\nIt's to help us pop out for\nthe canvas for now.\n\n36\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.865\nMaybe we'll worry about that,\nI never admitted that style was my forte.\n\n37\n00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.487\nVonne, we wanted to make sure\nthat this all came about.\n\n38\n00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:17.734\nAnd if we come over here,\nhere's our canvas.\n\n39\n00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:21.790\nHere's our canvas with 2D canvas context.\n\n40\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.841\nAnd we just filled the rect.\n\n41\n00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.308\nNow, I don't need this.\n\n42\n00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:29.085\nI don't need this to have anything.\n\n43\n00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:32.450\nIt doesn't have any purpose,\nmoving forward.\n\n44\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.130\nSo if we come back and we refresh,\nwe have our blank canvas.\n\n45\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.704\nNow, let me further describe\nwhat I mean by pencil drawing.\n\n46\n00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:43.260\nI'm thinking, and at least initially,\nwe're gonna continue to expand this at\n\n47\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.320\nleast initially, I wanna be able to\nclick and kinda drag around like so,\n\n48\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.070\nand it draw behind me, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.438\nSo it draws everything and\nthen when I unclick, it stops there.\n\n50\n00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:59.380\nSo just kinda like you would put\nthe pencils down, you would scribble, and\n\n51\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.820\nyou would pick the pencil up.\n\n52\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.540\n&gt;&gt; Just like you said with any of\nthose paint programs I'm doing a,\n\n53\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.390\ngoing back in time of where my Apple\n2C and I had like an actual joystick,\n\n54\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.880\nand you'd hold the button down and\ndraw and that was so cool.\n\n55\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's what we wanna make.\n\n56\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.950\nNow, that means that we\nneed to grab certain\n\n57\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.180\nattributes from the clicks and\nmore specifically,\n\n58\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.090\nwe're gonna be talking about a few events\nthat maybe you haven't used before.\n\n59\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.420\nRight, we wanna keep track\nof when things are moving,\n\n60\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.460\nwhen the mouse has been kinda moused down,\nit's,\n\n61\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.550\nwe don't wanna track click, but\njust a mouse down and then a mouse up.\n\n62\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.040\nSo, this is a little bit\ndifferent flavor on that.\n\n63\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.622\nAnd I think it's probably best we\njust go ahead and dive right in.\n\n64\n00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:46.909\nSo, here's what I'm thinking.\n\n65\n00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.387\nI'm thinking we want to\nhandle mouse downs and\n\n66\n00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:53.697\nI am going to just get this working,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:54.393\nLet's just get it working.\n\n68\n00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:58.463\nWe're not worried about how beautiful\nour code is, we can always come back and\n\n69\n00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.060\naddress that later.\n\n70\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.890\nWe may find that we paint ourselves into\na corner, but we can always get out.\n\n71\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.650\nUnlike in real life where I am just going\nto have to wait here until it gets better.\n\n72\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.560\nSo, we wanna handle muse down and\nmouse up.\n\n73\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.130\nAnd mousemove events.\n\n74\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.900\nOkay.\n\n75\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.670\nNow, let me further describe here.\n\n76\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.170\nIn context of what I just showed you,\nwhen I clicked the button,\n\n77\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.820\nI just clicked right there.\n\n78\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.550\nI want to register that event and\nmodify some state.\n\n79\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.320\nOkay, now we're drawing.\n\n80\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.970\nI think this is gonna work.\n\n81\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.820\nI could be total wrong and we may just\nhave to abandon ship and I'll run out and\n\n82\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.621\nit'll be all good.\n\n83\n00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:41.075\nI wanna say, all right, now we're\ndrawing but pen is to the paper or\n\n84\n00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:43.650\nthe pencils to the paper so to speak.\n\n85\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.460\nAnd then, as long as we're moving,\nwe want to record where we've moved to.\n\n86\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.562\nOkay, and then mouse up.\n\n87\n00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:56.430\nI wanna say this is off the table,\nwe're done.\n\n88\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.110\nRecord that last place,\nand that's all over there.\n\n89\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.230\nNow to keep things straight,\nI may have to reference a few things, but\n\n90\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.900\nthat's perfectly okay.\n\n91\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.362\nNow what are we recording?\n\n92\n00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:10.130\nI wanna record the points\nof where the mouse was.\n\n93\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.420\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna create a few variable here.\n\n94\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.340\nThese are global variables for\nstate of application.\n\n95\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.760\nAnd, let's see.\n\n96\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.310\nWe need to keep track of points.\n\n97\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.370\nAll right, now what do I mean by points?\n\n98\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.460\nThe X and Y position on the canvas, right?\n\n99\n00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.940\nIf you have small children,\nI'm not saying I do, or do not, but\n\n100\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.640\nI have seen,\nI'm coloring inside the lines, well,\n\n101\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.098\nwe don't wanna accidentally\ncolor outside the lines.\n\n102\n00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:43.180\nSo, we wanna make sure it's in\nreference to the canvas object, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:48.760\nNow, we wanna keep track of those points\nand we may do some different things here.\n\n104\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.420\nAnd so, not on Window but\ninstead the canvas.\n\n105\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.550\nI think we're gonna add an event\nlistener here for a mouse down.\n\n106\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.870\nAll right, and we're gonna take\na look at these events independently\n\n107\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.600\nbecause we gotta keep\ntrack of a few things.\n\n108\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.256\nAnd then mouse up, well I wanna\nsay canvas.addEventListener for\n\n109\n00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:18.990\nmouse up, just like so.\n\n110\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.080\nI'm using these fat arrow functions just\nto further reiterate you're probably sick\n\n111\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.870\nof hearing me say this.\n\n112\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.020\nThis is newer browsers only.\n\n113\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.940\nThis is new features of JavaScript.\n\n114\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.730\nIf your browser doesn't support these,\nyou can always,\n\n115\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.080\nalways go back to a standard\nfunction like so.\n\n116\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.400\nJust like that, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.080\nNow the way I use these will\ndiffer a little bit but\n\n118\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.910\nif you have no idea about those,\ngo check out our library.\n\n119\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.960\nI talk extensively about JavaScript as\nwell as new features in JavaScript.\n\n120\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.770\nWe're gonna go ahead an undo this.\n\n121\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.220\nAnd then finally, for mouse move.\n\n122\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.457\nNow, in previous episodes,\n\n123\n00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.428\nI've talked about adding these event\nlisteners to the window option.\n\n124\n00:06:57.428 --> 00:07:02.932\nThat works for the keyboard, but\nif I want to track, right, on the canvas,\n\n125\n00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:07.322\nI probably need the canvas to\nbe the one emitting set events.\n\n126\n00:07:07.322 --> 00:07:10.244\nSo addEventListener, and\n\n127\n00:07:10.244 --> 00:07:15.585\nhere's our mousemove,\nand then e, there we go.\n\n128\n00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.720\nSo there's our three EventListeners.\n\n129\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.000\nNow lets see here,\nlet's just console.log mouse down.\n\n130\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.080\nThat's gonna be the only one so\n\n131\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.910\nwe can see it actually print out and\nI'm gonna come over here.\n\n132\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.970\nI have my DevTools open but\nI need to come to the console.\n\n133\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.070\nI'm gonna refresh and\nthen there's our mouse down.\n\n134\n00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.170\nAll right, so I'm gonna pull this over\njust a little bit so we can see, and\n\n135\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.721\nif I move down,\nhere's our movement offset in our screen.\n\n136\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.819\nHmm, x and then x here.\n\n137\n00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:50.727\nOkay, notice our offset.\n\n138\n00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:54.568\nI'm gonna come up here to\nthe very tip top corner so\n\n139\n00:07:54.568 --> 00:07:57.312\nwe can say that should be zero zero,\n\n140\n00:07:57.312 --> 00:08:02.260\nright, based on the The convention\nof graphics and computers.\n\n141\n00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.958\nSo if we come over here, and we look,\noffset x and offset y one and\n\n142\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.270\ntwo and\nthen if we come down here it says nine.\n\n143\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.410\nWhich one is it?\n\n144\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.410\nWell, this offset is kind\nof offset from the window.\n\n145\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.605\nSo notice I have these\nlittle bit of margin here.\n\n146\n00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:27.800\nBut from the upper top left corner,\nit's over here.\n\n147\n00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.990\nAnd then the offset is,\nwell, it's nine and\n\n148\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.090\nthen the offset is based on\nthe offset of the canvas, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.470\nSo we'll have to do some\nmanipulations there.\n\n150\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like you didn't\nset your padding to zero.\n\n151\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.380\nAt least I remember like in the box model,\n\n152\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.780\nor back in my coding days, you have to set\nthe padding to zero, the margins to zero,\n\n153\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.070\nto kind of eliminate all of the extra\nstuff that the browser adds,\n\n154\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.180\nis that somewhat in the same context or\nam I completely off?\n\n155\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.084\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, so\n\n156\n00:08:58.084 --> 00:09:02.525\nwe have these complicated relationships,\nthese relative positioning that we will\n\n157\n00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:04.910\nprobably have to handle,\nbut you know what?\n\n158\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.400\nMaybe initially we don't even\nworry about those, right?\n\n159\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.514\nWe just use the X and the Y and see, hey,\n\n160\n00:09:10.514 --> 00:09:14.018\nis this actually behaving\nlike I want it to?\n\n161\n00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:17.797\nI did want to draw your attention because\nwhen you're doing mouse-up, mouse-down,\n\n162\n00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:20.210\nand mouse move there can be\nsome complicating factors.\n\n163\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.535\nIt may be exacerbated by the fact that\nif I move this way over to the right,\n\n164\n00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:28.630\nlike I float it right then those may\nbecome more of an issue than they are now.\n\n165\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.460\nSo it's a relative scale thing.\n\n166\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.880\nBut we'll worry about those when and\nif we need to.\n\n167\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.960\nI just wanted to draw your\nattention to said things.\n\n168\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.560\nAnd then we have that mouse enter.\n\n169\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.900\nOr excuse me, mouse down.\n\n170\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.830\nLet's make sure that this is wired up.\n\n171\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.710\nWe have no typos.\n\n172\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.830\nAnd then if I say e and I refresh.\n\n173\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.600\nThere's the mouse down and the mouse up.\n\n174\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.510\nSo click click so down and up.\n\n175\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.630\nSo a click is actually a combination.\n\n176\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.740\nYou could think of it as a combination\nof a mouse down mouse up.\n\n177\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.030\nBut now we can look at\nthose independently,\n\n178\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.880\ninstead of just an entire click cycle.\n\n179\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.160\nSo a click is one.\n\n180\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.970\nI can look at it on the down press,\nas well as on the release.\n\n181\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.050\nThen notice my mouse move\nis not doing anything.\n\n182\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.910\nBut if I say console.log,\nmoving the mouse.\n\n183\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.290\nLike so.\n\n184\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.120\nAnd we refresh.\n\n185\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.210\nNotice it is firing an event every\ntime the mouse kind of moves,\n\n186\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.440\nby default, on top of the canvas.\n\n187\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.790\nAll right, so, we have these three events.\n\n188\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.310\nNow\n&gt;&gt; Here's what I think we should do.\n\n189\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.640\nWe know how to draw lines.\n\n190\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.970\nIf you're like, I'm not real sure how\nto draw lines in the HTML5 canvas,\n\n191\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.170\ndefinitely go check out\nsome of our other videos.\n\n192\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.940\nI talk extensively about that.\n\n193\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.290\nI want to get the points.\n\n194\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.440\nWe're good to go.\n\n195\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:01.620\nI'm thinking that maybe we just re-render\nthese every time one of these event fires.\n\n196\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.160\nWe need a render method and we need\nsome way to collect all of said points.\n\n197\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.840\nAll right.\n\n198\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.030\nI have my points here, and\nI have my event listeners.\n\n199\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.930\nLet's create a few of these functions.\n\n200\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.488\nNow I'm gonna use a regular function,\nso I don't have to bring these back up.\n\n201\n00:11:18.488 --> 00:11:22.400\nIn this context.\n\n202\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.100\nSo I would normally,\nif I use a function expression,\n\n203\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.870\nhave to pull those to the top of\nthe file so they would be available.\n\n204\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.860\nBut I'm gonna leave them down here.\n\n205\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.360\nAnd there are some ways around that.\n\n206\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.140\nAnd here we go.\n\n207\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.670\nSo what is render going to do?\n\n208\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.970\nWell, render is going to take the context.\n\n209\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.460\nAnd run through all the points and\nessentially make a line from it.\n\n210\n00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.936\nYou can think of a line as a stippling and\nI've done some stippling in art.\n\n211\n00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:50.113\nYou can make things that look like\nlines from a whole bunch of points and\n\n212\n00:11:50.113 --> 00:11:54.080\neffectively you do that at infinity,\nyou got a line.\n\n213\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.171\nSo I'm going to say context, or\n\n214\n00:11:58.171 --> 00:12:03.329\nexcuse me, points.forEach(point.\n\n215\n00:12:03.329 --> 00:12:07.066\nThen I want to render,\n\n216\n00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:13.090\nlet's see how would I best do this?\n\n217\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.500\nI wanna go to the first one and\nthen I want to go\n\n218\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.440\nthrough all of them so\nI don't think this is going to work.\n\n219\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.730\nReally what I want is the first and\nthe rest of them.\n\n220\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:35.930\nSo I'm going to pull the points\napart like this and then say rest.\n\n221\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.510\nThese are still points that's the rest\nof the points except for the first one.\n\n222\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.210\nAnd then I'm gonna use\nthe context to draw all of those.\n\n223\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.130\nOkay.\n\n224\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.090\nSo I'm going to say context.save.\n\n225\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.798\nLike so.\n\n226\n00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:53.330\nAnd then context.restore that way if we\nend up changing anything inside of our\n\n227\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.410\nrender maybe line cap style or\njoin style or whatever.\n\n228\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.340\nThen it does not affect other things\nthat we may render on the screen.\n\n229\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.823\nSo for the first point.\n\n230\n00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:05.370\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n231\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:11.057\nI want to say context move to and\nI think I'm going\n\n232\n00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:17.359\nto keep these separately like first.x,\nfirst.y.\n\n233\n00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:20.000\nSo the points are going to be\nan object that have an xy.\n\n234\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.720\nI think I've settled on that.\n\n235\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.150\nIt will make it a little\neasier to read but\n\n236\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:29.700\nit'll also be easier to keep track of\nx and y positions instead of saying\n\n237\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.330\norganized by X is always first,\nY is always second.\n\n238\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.913\nAnd then likewise, I'm gonna say\n\n239\n00:13:37.913 --> 00:13:43.650\ncontext.line to point.x, point.y.\n\n240\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:48.710\nAnd that's for every point in\nall of the rest of the points.\n\n241\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.730\nOkay?\n\n242\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.960\nSo move to the first one and\n\n243\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.610\nthen start creating little line\nsegments between the points.\n\n244\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:01.280\nAnd then finally I want to context and\nyou know what\n\n245\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.814\nI actually forgot something I have to\nbegin the path because this is a path,\n\n246\n00:14:06.814 --> 00:14:12.610\nbegin path and I'm going to close path.\n\n247\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.960\nI always get this mixed up.\n\n248\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.820\nI always want to put close and end.\n\n249\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.080\nI think it's closed but it might be end,\nwe're about to find out.\n\n250\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.840\nAnd then, don't forget to stroke.\n\n251\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.380\nIf you do it may draw the path.\n\n252\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.998\nIt just won't be visible to you,\nbecause there's no actual stroke set.\n\n253\n00:14:29.998 --> 00:14:34.180\nAll right, so,there it is, and\n\n254\n00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.370\nwell, let's just set up\na couple of mock objects here.\n\n255\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.700\nSo I want to go from zero, zero, to\n\n256\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.100\nand these are gonna be individual\nobjects with x and y coordinates okay?\n\n257\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.657\nAnd just to make maybe these\na little bit more readable.\n\n258\n00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:59.124\nSo I'm gonna have these objects\nthat have an x and a y.\n\n259\n00:14:59.124 --> 00:15:01.280\nAnd that's how I've used them down here.\n\n260\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:09.540\nAnd here I'm gonna say x,\nlet's just go 300, and y, 100.\n\n261\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.630\nTotally making these numbers up.\n\n262\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.460\nThere's nothing magical about the numbers\nor there shouldn't be anything magical.\n\n263\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.834\nLet's go see if we have any issues cuz\nif we try to start wiring up our click\n\n264\n00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:23.783\nhandlers to add points to this\nthat'll be re-rendered [SOUND] and\n\n265\n00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:26.899\nwe haven't confirmed that\nit renders initially.\n\n266\n00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:29.500\nIt may be chasing a bug that\ndoesn't actually exist.\n\n267\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.670\nAll right, so if we refresh, and moving.\n\n268\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.795\nYou know what?\nYou actually have to call render, as well.\n\n269\n00:15:35.795 --> 00:15:42.110\n[LAUGH]\nLet's just call render the first time.\n\n270\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.060\nIf we render, and notice that I kind\nof have this rendered out, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.100\nThis works, that's all I need to know.\n\n272\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.788\nNow, it is a little bit pixelated because\nI have this blown up really large,\n\n273\n00:15:53.788 --> 00:15:56.050\nkind of zoomed-in based\non our aspect ratio.\n\n274\n00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:00.778\nSo it is gonna look a little pixelated For\nyou, just know that if I\n\n275\n00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:05.610\nbring this down to 100% based on\nthe size it looks like a line.\n\n276\n00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:11.410\nThere's not super defined pixelation\nunless you zoom in once again.\n\n277\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.116\nAll right, so\nthat's what I mean by its a bit map.\n\n278\n00:16:14.116 --> 00:16:16.300\nIt's doing individual pixels.\n\n279\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.620\nSo our line works,\nI think our scheme's going to work.\n\n280\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.830\nBut how do we add points\nto the points array?\n\n281\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.160\nAll right, all right, so\nlet's think about this.\n\n282\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.381\nSo I think that when I mousedown,\n\n283\n00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:38.120\nI do wanna go ahead and\na point, wherever it is.\n\n284\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.230\nSo when I mousedown, there we go, and\n\n285\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:46.030\nI remove this, so\nthere's nothing there on page load.\n\n286\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:52.060\nWhen I mousedown,\nI want to grab the respective x and y.\n\n287\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.670\nAnd we're just gonna go x and\ny, like this.\n\n288\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.810\nSo I'm gonna pull that\noff of the event object.\n\n289\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.020\nAnd again, we may have to worry\nabout shifting initially,\n\n290\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.530\nbased on offsets or later on, excuse me.\n\n291\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.500\nBut initially,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n292\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:14.867\nAnd then, I'm thinking that\npoints.push x: x, y: y, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:19.340\nSo I'm gonna read an object and\n\n294\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.960\npush it into that array.\n\n295\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.820\nSo that should be on mousedown.\n\n296\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.240\nLet's go see if that actually works.\n\n297\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.790\nIf I refresh, and\nnow if I come over here and\n\n298\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:38.440\nsay points, notice I have three objects\nthat have an x and a y position.\n\n299\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.330\nThose essentially are going\nto be my line two vertices.\n\n300\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Were you clicking each time?\n\n301\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.024\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was doing it mousedown and so\n\n302\n00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.830\nthe mousedown is actually\ngonna push a point.\n\n303\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it was like you click those\nthree ones where you click, click, click.\n\n304\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.271\nYou weren't holding the mousedown while\nyou were dragging you were just testing to\n\n305\n00:17:57.271 --> 00:18:00.862\nmake sure that it is going to push\nout those points of where I clicked.\n\n306\n00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.860\nIt's gonna recognize the x and a y and\nthat's what we're getting as a result.\n\n307\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.508\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nnow I'm just testing this initial.\n\n308\n00:18:05.508 --> 00:18:08.653\nI'm probably gonna have to go change\nthis because this should only add\n\n309\n00:18:08.653 --> 00:18:09.410\na single point.\n\n310\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.015\nAnd then, let me drag and\n\n311\n00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:15.610\nadd additional points as I move my\nmouse while I've kind of clicked on.\n\n312\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\ncuz I'm following where you're going but\n\n313\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.940\nI just wanted to make sure that\nit was a click and not a drag.\n\n314\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.986\nI saw when the log was doing that, but\nI think I'm still in the minds of where\n\n315\n00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:29.536\nyou're saying, you're going to click,\nhold, and drag down.\n\n316\n00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:31.160\nAnd I'm like, wait,\nwe're not there yet, [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll get there we promise,\n\n318\n00:18:32.917 --> 00:18:34.100\nI promise.\n\n319\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.910\nBut you're absolutely correct it is on the\ndownward motion because it is a mousedown.\n\n320\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.292\nNow, the other logs that you\nare seeing are the mousemoves, and\n\n321\n00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:42.490\nthe mouseup, right?\n\n322\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:48.250\nSo I'm releasing, that should actually\nterminate kind of as I'm drawing.\n\n323\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.830\nSo if I mousedown, I'm now drawing.\n\n324\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.550\nAs long as I have my mousedown,\nI'm still drawing.\n\n325\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.640\nAnd when I mouseup, I've removed my\npencil from the paper so to speak.\n\n326\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.158\n&gt;&gt; That's what you mean by terminate\nlike when I let go I'm done.\n\n327\n00:19:03.158 --> 00:19:07.880\nYep, yep, and right now,\nwe don't have that capability but\n\n328\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.670\nwe will get there were gonna have\nto do some finagling so to speak.\n\n329\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:16.440\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe know this pushes right,\n\n330\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.805\npoints push that pushes it up into there.\n\n331\n00:19:18.805 --> 00:19:19.880\nAnd you know what I'm thinking?\n\n332\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:27.562\nI'm thinking that every time we move,\n\n333\n00:19:27.562 --> 00:19:32.360\nI think we should re-render.\n\n334\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.283\nAnd every time we mouseup,\nwe should re-render.\n\n335\n00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:37.008\nNot on mousedown because that\nshould be the start, right?\n\n336\n00:19:37.008 --> 00:19:39.840\nI just put my pencil to my paper.\n\n337\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:45.240\nBut anytime after that,\nthat I move, or let her pick my\n\n338\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.140\npencil off the paper, it should re-render\nto all the points that have accumulated.\n\n339\n00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz you don't want it to keep\ngoing like if you let go it's like stop\n\n340\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.190\nputting the stroke on where\nthe mouse cursor is located.\n\n341\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.220\nThat's what we mean by, like re-render.\n\n342\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:05.514\nStop doing the actual function of render\nand stop it, and re go back in, [LAUGH].\n\n343\n00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:10.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what I wanted to say,\nbut you hear what I'm saying?\n\n344\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you get the idea.\n\n345\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.530\nI think you get the idea.\n\n346\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.100\nNow the implementation details may be\na little more difficult than that.\n\n347\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.912\nBut let's see here.\n\n348\n00:20:18.912 --> 00:20:21.450\nOn mouseup, and\n\n349\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.248\nlet's actually deal with that initially\nbecause we may get some weirdness.\n\n350\n00:20:26.248 --> 00:20:30.135\nWhen I mousedown, I think it's probably\n\n351\n00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:35.032\nbest to have an isDrawing and\ninitially we're not.\n\n352\n00:20:35.032 --> 00:20:37.710\nAnd that way I'm not recording any points.\n\n353\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:44.239\nWhen I click mousedown right here,\n\n354\n00:20:44.239 --> 00:20:50.123\nisDrawing = true, all right?\n\n355\n00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:55.985\nAnd when I mouseup isDrawing = false,\nokay.\n\n356\n00:20:55.985 --> 00:21:03.900\nLike wise I think we probably\nneed this right here.\n\n357\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.663\nI wanna record that last\npoint when I mouseup, okay.\n\n358\n00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:14.054\nAnd then, really that gives us the ability\n\n359\n00:21:14.054 --> 00:21:21.410\nto have logic of saying when you move,\nonly if isDrawing.\n\n360\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:26.210\nOnly if you are drawing do you\nwant to record said points.\n\n361\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.380\nokay?\n\n362\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.134\nAnd we talked about render,\nI'm gonna come back to that, I promise.\n\n363\n00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:34.460\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is a silly\nquestion, but isDrawing true?\n\n364\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:41.585\nI guess, you don't have to add is true,\njust the isDrawing means that you are?\n\n365\n00:21:41.585 --> 00:21:44.088\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Inside this if statement it will\n\n366\n00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:48.250\nactually evaluate to whatever\nvalue is held in the variable.\n\n367\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.074\nSo this is kind of like if true, so\nit'll just do a final replace for you,\n\n368\n00:21:52.074 --> 00:21:53.298\neffectively.\n\n369\n00:21:53.298 --> 00:21:53.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:54.640\n&gt;&gt; There's a little more to it,\n\n371\n00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.770\nbut that way I don't have to\ncheck to see if it's true.\n\n372\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.040\nI could just use it as if it was true or\nfalse.\n\n373\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.170\nNow be careful in JavaScript you have some\nfalse and truthy shenanigans that'll crop\n\n374\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.490\nup that maybe hard to run down, but\nthis is a pretty common paradigm.\n\n375\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.010\nIf I have already clicked, and now I'm\ndragging that means that I will want to\n\n376\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.080\nrecord the points and\nre-render up to that point, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.390\nAnd we're gonna get some weirdness\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the mouse up would go ahead and\n\n378\n00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.550\ncancel it out, and the only way that if\nyou're moving and your mouse is down,\n\n379\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.570\nis that?\n\n380\n00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n381\n00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.084\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you are-\n&gt;&gt; As soon as I started saying it he goes,\n\n382\n00:22:27.084 --> 00:22:29.136\nI'm like, yes, okay, I'm getting it,\n\n383\n00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:29.816\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n384\n00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:33.123\nIf I understand what you're\nsaying appropriately,\n\n385\n00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:36.950\nwhich I'm not always saying I\nget on the first try, then yes.\n\n386\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.718\nSo what we're gonna do is only if we\nare drawing while moving the mouse,\n\n387\n00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:45.170\ndo we want to grab that x and\ny value, like so.\n\n388\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.886\n&gt;&gt; And then say points.push,\nmaybe x: x, y: y.\n\n389\n00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:56.922\nNow, there are newer JavaScript features\nthat will allow me to shorten that,\n\n390\n00:22:56.922 --> 00:23:01.683\nbut I think I am going\nto refactor this anyway.\n\n391\n00:23:01.683 --> 00:23:07.021\nAnd as I am moving, I think that’s\nall I want to do other than,\n\n392\n00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:10.220\nI think I always want to re-render.\n\n393\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.559\nI always want to render after I mouseup,\nokay.\n\n394\n00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:19.191\nSo this render's going to grab that global\n\n395\n00:23:19.191 --> 00:23:23.953\nvariable that's holding all the points and\n\n396\n00:23:23.953 --> 00:23:28.861\nre-render those to the screen, all right?\n\n397\n00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:32.357\nLet's cross your fingers,\nshe's got them crossed,\n\n398\n00:23:32.357 --> 00:23:35.631\nI'm pretty sure she's got\nthem her toes crossed.\n\n399\n00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:37.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, so let's see.\n\n400\n00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:41.131\n&gt;&gt; Cannot read property x of undefined.\n\n401\n00:23:41.131 --> 00:23:42.071\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, so\n\n402\n00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:44.600\nwe've got a little bit of an issue here.\n\n403\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.210\nAnd that was on mousemove.\n\n404\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.110\nCannot read property x of undefined.\n\n405\n00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:56.336\nSo let's see here, e and all right.\n\n406\n00:23:56.336 --> 00:24:01.358\nLet's look at this MouseEvent And\nthere's x and\n\n407\n00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:08.230\nthat is very interesting Vonne,] maybe,\nmaybe we just do this.\n\n408\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.942\nWe pull this out to make sure I don't\nhave any crazy scoping issues because\n\n409\n00:24:12.942 --> 00:24:14.314\ncost is block scope.\n\n410\n00:24:14.314 --> 00:24:19.572\nAnd paste,\ncannot read property x is undefined.\n\n411\n00:24:19.572 --> 00:24:23.092\n&gt;&gt; So\nJustin I'm pretty sure this isn't it, but\n\n412\n00:24:23.092 --> 00:24:26.990\nI know from watching your\nepisodes it one of those.\n\n413\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.120\nI play the matching game,\n\n414\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.270\ncuz sometimes I don't always know\nexactly what you're talking about.\n\n415\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.580\nBut I can see that doesn't match, that\ndoesn't match, maybe that could be it.\n\n416\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.080\nAnd I've done a lot of typesetting lately,\nla ot of proofing so I saw some space\n\n417\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:45.840\nbetween your, y colon space y and\nthen the other one was y colon no space y.\n\n418\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.650\nPretty sure that's not it but maybe?\n\n419\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Well that is definitely a good\ndebugging technique because right\n\n420\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.680\nsometimes I've printed out things and\nline by line which one of these match?\n\n421\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.790\nSo I should be consistent in that and\nI'll probably fix that.\n\n422\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.330\nHowever, you're right,\nI don't think its that.\n\n423\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm right that you're wrong.\n\n424\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do think I know what it is.\n\n425\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.150\nSo let's go ahead and\nfix that little bit of formatting and\n\n426\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.170\nagain we may come back and\nrefactor that well not me, I'm going to.\n\n427\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.530\nBut let's get that error\nshenanigans to stop going.\n\n428\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.790\nAll right, so I think you're talking\nabout this y:y here and this y:y here.\n\n429\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, spacing doesn't\nmake a difference in this point.\n\n430\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ny space the limited in JavaScript is not?\n\n431\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.757\nHowever, right here,\nyou're keeping me on my toes.\n\n432\n00:25:34.757 --> 00:25:35.613\n&gt;&gt; A matching game, matchy, matchy..\n\n433\n00:25:35.613 --> 00:25:39.990\n&gt;&gt; A matching game,\nhowever I do think I know what's going on.\n\n434\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.040\nIf we come back over here,\nand let's refresh the page.\n\n435\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.940\nAnd notice how, I haven't clicked or\n\n436\n00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.570\nanything, I'm just mouse moving and\nit says cannot find property, undefined.\n\n437\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.470\nIf I'm not mistaken, and ultimately,\nI don't think I'm going to keep it\n\n438\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.620\nlike this, I don't think render\nis a good thing to do here.\n\n439\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.798\nThis is a render portion,\n\n440\n00:25:58.798 --> 00:26:03.750\nwell It's not checking to see\nif there are points defined.\n\n441\n00:26:05.895 --> 00:26:09.390\nI made the assumption that there\nare points defined, at least one.\n\n442\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:15.884\nAnd what happened was is,\nmoved to first.x first.y.\n\n443\n00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:21.090\nWell, first,\nuntil I click doesn't actually exist.\n\n444\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.300\n&gt;&gt; That's the undefined\nbecause you said first.\n\n445\n00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.990\nAnd then you were moving so\ntheir is no first, I don't understand,\n\n446\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.650\nthat's the mismatch.\n\n447\n00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's the mismatch.\n\n448\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.080\n&gt;&gt; So, what we'll find out is there's\nprobably a better way to do this, but\n\n449\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.550\nlet's just get something working.\n\n450\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:41.910\nAnd I think what I'm going to\ndo is just pull this render and\n\n451\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:47.090\nsay only rerender if I'm\npushing a new point, right?\n\n452\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.359\nOnly if I'm drawing do I want\nto rerender onmousemove okay?\n\n453\n00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.420\nAnd that should get and\n\n454\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.570\nshould is a strong keyword there\nshould give me notice no more errors.\n\n455\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:02.110\nAnd then if I, I kinda got that right.\n\n456\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.680\nThat's pretty cool,\nnot what I anticipated.\n\n457\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.720\n&gt;&gt; I like that, that's neat!\n\n458\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.360\n&gt;&gt; That is neat,\nnot what I was going for, though.\n\n459\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.290\nAnd well, why is that?\n\n460\n00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.990\nWell if we come down here and\nwe look, with line two, right?\n\n461\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.140\nAnd let's close path,\nI did that correctly, I think.\n\n462\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.110\nIt hasn't errored out on me yet.\n\n463\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:32.940\nSo I line to each one of these,\nbut why is it not.\n\n464\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.720\nLet's go look at points and see if we\ncan figure out what's going on here.\n\n465\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.010\nSo this is 280 points it's amazing how\nquickly you can get ahold of things.\n\n466\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:50.380\nAnd if I move,well lets refresh and\nlet's do a quick swipe so\n\n467\n00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.990\nit is drawing the line that I expect\nto but notice where it's lining too.\n\n468\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.970\n&gt;&gt; It keeps going back to the first point.\n\n469\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.800\nSo everywhere when you're moving\nout it's going back to that first.\n\n470\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.338\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's lining out from\nthat initial point [NOISE] So\n\n471\n00:28:06.338 --> 00:28:09.654\nwhat I need to do is\nmove to the next point.\n\n472\n00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:16.250\nNow, this is a get it working scenario,\nwe'll probably do some switching around.\n\n473\n00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.835\nBut, I'm thinking, I'm thinking we can say\n\n474\n00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:26.186\ncontext move to point.x point.y like so.\n\n475\n00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:32.960\nWe refresh and\nnow we have ourselves a pencil.\n\n476\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.975\nIt's kind of hard to draw with\na touchpad but now we have our basic.\n\n477\n00:28:37.975 --> 00:28:44.120\nWe've got some weirdness going on,\nbut our main idea is there right.\n\n478\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.350\nSo if I move around\nhere it does draw that.\n\n479\n00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.950\nDo notice I haven't moved my mouse cursor\nnotice that the line is actually offset\n\n480\n00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.020\nfrom the tip of the mouse.\n\n481\n00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.140\nWhy is that offset occurring?\n\n482\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.570\n&gt;&gt; That was that thing you talked about\nin the beginning and that's coming back.\n\n483\n00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.910\nIt's like you planned that.\n\n484\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, we are going to have to handle\n\n485\n00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.910\nthat, that's totally fine.\n\n486\n00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.350\nBut now that I move over here.\n\n487\n00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.690\n&gt;&gt; We're continuing.\n\n488\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.660\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I wanted.\n\n489\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.010\nI actually wanted to start a new stroke.\n\n490\n00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.550\nI wanted something new and I have\nan update screen, but it'll be all right.\n\n491\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.550\nI think we're going to have\nto do some refactoring,\n\n492\n00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.700\npretty sure we don't have time.\n\n493\n00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.370\nWe do have our pencil drawing working,\nbut it looks like we're going\n\n494\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.860\nto have to come back in a part two,\ndo some reorganization.\n\n495\n00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:36.285\nAnd so you might have to rethink this\nproblem a little bit to get those separate\n\n496\n00:29:36.285 --> 00:29:41.040\npaths as a series of points that aren't\nalways necessarily connected together.\n\n497\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Well I like the first one where you\nweren't really intending to do that,\n\n498\n00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.870\nwhere it connected back\nto the first point.\n\n499\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.440\nIt kind of looked like a laser light show,\nooh, look at that.\n\n500\n00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.590\nI was kind of having fun with that.\n\n501\n00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.850\nBut like you said,\nit wasn't the scope of the project.\n\n502\n00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.340\nBut I am glad we got it working and\nwe'll figure out the continuation or\n\n503\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.270\nnot continuation of the path but\nwe will continue on to a part two.\n\n504\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.310\nSee what I did there?\n\n505\n00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.060\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did.\n\n506\n00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.700\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n507\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.930\n&gt;&gt; Wordplay it makes me happy.\n\n508\n00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.830\n&gt;&gt; All right we're going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n509\n00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.750\nSigning off for DevPro TV,\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n510\n00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n511\n00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:22.500\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n",

edition of DevProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.780\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and we are\ncontinuing on with HTML5 Canvas projects.\n\n5\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.430\nAnd we're doing a part two of drawing\na line or creating a pencil-like drawing.\n\n6\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.380\nSomething with pencils and\nsomething with drawing.\n\n7\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.530\nAnd here to connect all the dots for\nus is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.730\nHow are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.790\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.330\nExcept I'm supposed to be the one?\n\n11\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.240\nI thought you got this.\n\n12\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.285\nNah, I'm just joking.\n\n13\n00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, and\n\n14\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.880\nhow are you today, Vonne?\n\n15\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.910\n&gt;&gt; You kinda made my heart stop there for\na little bit.\n\n16\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.008\nI'm like, wait, what?\n\n17\n00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.098\nNo, no, we didn't talk about this [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, my plan is coming together.\n\n19\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.290\nAnd how are you today?\n\n20\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.560\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n21\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.710\nI'm excited to know where\nwe're continuing on, well,\n\n22\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.100\nbecause our path was continuing when we\nare drawing with our pencil-like drawing.\n\n23\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.250\nAnd the whole idea was coming back to\nmake it to where every time you let go,\n\n24\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.560\nit was supposed to draw a new one.\n\n25\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.930\nIs that where we're at?\n\n26\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Refresh my memory.\n\n27\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770\n&gt;&gt; We fixed a couple of things.\n\n28\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.844\nAnd we'll take a look at the existing\napplication in its current state\n\n29\n00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:16.633\nin just a moment.\n\n30\n00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:20.629\nBut we fixed a couple of things, like\nthe weird like fan pattern that we had.\n\n31\n00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.036\n&gt;&gt; I was a fan of that one, I liked that.\n\n32\n00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.674\n&gt;&gt; If you have no idea what we're talking\nabout, then definitely go check out part\n\n33\n00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.897\none because it was like a happy\naccident or something, I don't know.\n\n34\n00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:34.428\nLike well that's not what I expected,\nbut it works, and those things happen.\n\n35\n00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.870\nOur main goal in part one\nwas to get it working.\n\n36\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.490\nYou know,\nI was looking through this code, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.030\nI'm not necessarily happy\nwith its organization.\n\n38\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.110\nAnd there's probably some things that\nwould make it a little more readable,\n\n39\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.090\nat least in my eyes.\n\n40\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.390\nAnd maybe you have different opinions.\n\n41\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.520\nBut it's always good to see alternative\nopinions because that's how we grow and\n\n42\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.380\nmake ourselves better.\n\n43\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.860\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat where our application stands.\n\n44\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.080\nAnd I'm gonna review\nwhat are our next steps.\n\n45\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.820\nBecause there may be a few of them.\n\n46\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.110\nHere we have our application.\n\n47\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.176\nI just refreshed and\nI can make a swirly gig.\n\n48\n00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:13.288\nAnd it's not quite at the tip,\nright at the tip of the cursor.\n\n49\n00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:14.858\nSo that's something that\nwe probably need to fix.\n\n50\n00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:18.549\n&gt;&gt; That was that offset thing that you had\ntalked about in the beginning of the first\n\n51\n00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.820\nepisode of like the nine,\nthe zero and the nine.\n\n52\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.553\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwe're gonna make use of the offset.\n\n53\n00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:26.980\nBut also I just stopped drawing.\n\n54\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.725\nAnd I'm gonna to be honest,\nthat offset thing bothers me a great deal.\n\n55\n00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:34.044\nThat would kind of be like you went to\nsign your name on the line of a check,\n\n56\n00:02:34.044 --> 00:02:37.070\n[LAUGH] if you know what a check is.\n\n57\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.497\nAnd then wherever you write\nit's like half a line down.\n\n58\n00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:42.748\nYou're like well, that's mad.\n\n59\n00:02:42.748 --> 00:02:45.475\n&gt;&gt; And well, yeah, and you're talking to\nsomeone that does a lot of typing and\n\n60\n00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:46.550\nis like this is the base line.\n\n61\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.090\nYou're supposed to write on the baseline.\n\n62\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.780\nIt's supposed to be there.\n\n63\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.488\nAnd it's like you have baseline shifting.\n\n64\n00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:53.191\nAnd you're like, why are you starting\nout all these technical terms for me?\n\n65\n00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:54.900\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nit's just not on the line.\n\n66\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.760\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of words Vonne, but\nI'm gonna go with it and say absolutely.\n\n67\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.390\nAnd these kind of manifest in\nthe smallest details with me.\n\n68\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.247\nI'm not always a huge stickler of those.\n\n69\n00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:06.570\nBut when I'm trying to draw a line, if I\nwanna draw a line I want it to be where\n\n70\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.770\nI'm pointing at, not necessarily\nthe back part of the pointer.\n\n71\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.390\nSo that's number one.\n\n72\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.970\nNumber two, I just stopped drawing.\n\n73\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.270\nWell, I wanna draw another one.\n\n74\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.440\nLet's say that I wanted to make a line up.\n\n75\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.070\nOops, so we have that issue.\n\n76\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.560\nAnd that may very well kind of come forth\nfrom how the application is organized.\n\n77\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.670\nSo I have to fix that.\n\n78\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.280\nBut if we come over and look,\n\n79\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.480\nwe got a lot of like global variables and\nthings going on.\n\n80\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.200\nI'm not necessarily a big fan of it,\nbecause if I come back and look it this\n\n81\n00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.480\napplication, there's nothing that tells\nme that this is the DevPaint application.\n\n82\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.780\nThere's nothing that tells me\nthat this all works together.\n\n83\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470\nNow, this is very much a personal opinion,\ncuz I'm kind of opinionated about this.\n\n84\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.870\nI don't like to chunk these together.\n\n85\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.747\nSo I know, well,\nthis is the application and\n\n86\n00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:59.529\nhere are some of my other objects or\nclasses that are abstracted.\n\n87\n00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:04.323\nNow, in JavaScript we have a new advent\nin ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015,\n\n88\n00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:08.217\nnew versions of JavaScript that\nallow us to use the class keyword.\n\n89\n00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:12.340\nAnd I'm gonna do that just\nto provide further exposure.\n\n90\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.360\nIf you wanna know more about that,\n\n91\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.740\ndefinitely go check out\nthe course library.\n\n92\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.330\nI talk about JavaScript at a fair length.\n\n93\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.190\nHopefully, that will come in handy.\n\n94\n00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.380\nNow, the first thing I wanna do is\nreorganize this to kind of just\n\n95\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.170\nbundle all this functionality\nup inside of an application.\n\n96\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.590\nAnd part of that is creating this new\nthing called, let's call it DevPaint.\n\n97\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.810\nSo that provides me with a little more\nsemantic meaning on kind of my intentions.\n\n98\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.700\nSo I'm gonna say constructor, and\n\n99\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.130\nmaybe I want to construct DevPaint\nin a multitude of places.\n\n100\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.820\nMaybe I have different selectors.\n\n101\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.700\nCuz as it stands,\nhere's my selector for my canvas.\n\n102\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.740\nWell maybe, maybe it's best\n\n103\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.880\nif I use that selector as my drawing\nportion as I pass that in as an argument.\n\n104\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.110\nAnd you'll see how that plays out shortly.\n\n105\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.720\nSo I'm gonna do this, and I'm just gonna\ngrab these two pieces of information.\n\n106\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.450\nWe are probably going to break\nsome things here, Vonne.\n\n107\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.920\nI'm not gonna lie to you.\n\n108\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.605\nAnd then paste.\n\n109\n00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:22.928\nAnd instead of hard coding this canvas,\n\n110\n00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:27.570\nand I won't do this ubiquitously but\nthis is kind of our main element.\n\n111\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.290\nThis is where all of our\ndrawing takes place.\n\n112\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.300\nWhy don't we use that one with\nthe selector being passed in?\n\n113\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.130\nLikewise, here are some other variables\nthat are currently in the global scope.\n\n114\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.125\nSo if anybody else on the page or\nanother developer or\n\n115\n00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:47.347\nsomeone that's working with me on\nthis project wanted to use isDrawing,\n\n116\n00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.930\nthey can't cuz I've taken isDrawing.\n\n117\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.970\nWell technically they can because I've\nused a led and they can rebind the value.\n\n118\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.142\nBut that means my application might break\nbecause of things that they have done.\n\n119\n00:05:56.142 --> 00:06:01.530\n[SOUND] Right on like that.\n\n120\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.890\nNow, I just wanna back up, I said rebind.\n\n121\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.600\nWhat I mean is they can\nmodify isDrawing to have\n\n122\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.880\nother values other than true and\nfalse, which was my intention.\n\n123\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.010\nAnd by doing that, some of this isDrawing\nlogic may change in my application or\n\n124\n00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.990\nat least my little portion of it if there\nis some overwriting of those variables.\n\n125\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.050\nNow points, I've used a const\nwhich means it's an array.\n\n126\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.821\nYou can't change it.\n\n127\n00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:33.571\nNow, they could put things\nin it that would change it.\n\n128\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.348\nSo I like to bundle this up and\nsay this is mine, this is my domain,\n\n129\n00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:39.890\nthis is kinda my name space.\n\n130\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.826\nSo I'm gonna grab these right here,\nand paste those.\n\n131\n00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:51.599\nNow as it stands, I need to say this dot.\n\n132\n00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.510\nSo I want this application to have\na canvas, I want this application to\n\n133\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.970\nhave a context, and I want this\napplication to have an array of points.\n\n134\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.500\nLikewise, I wanna keep\nsome internal state,\n\n135\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.590\nthis application, well am I drawing\non this application or not?\n\n136\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.450\nAll right, and then finally\nI'm going to abstract this and\n\n137\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.200\nsay this.setupEvents and\njust call a method.\n\n138\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.882\nAnd that way,\n\n139\n00:07:19.882 --> 00:07:22.570\nat the end of this constructor,\nwhat does this setupEvents do?\n\n140\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.400\nIts probably registering\na bunch of event handlers.\n\n141\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.245\nOkay, all right, so\nsetupEvents, just like that.\n\n142\n00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:34.350\nThen I'm gonna grab these\nportions right here.\n\n143\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.400\nAnd my goal is to do\nthis change around and\n\n144\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.000\nget exactly the same workings\nthat I had previously.\n\n145\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.558\nSo there we go, and paste that, and\n\n146\n00:07:46.558 --> 00:07:52.500\nI guess I should bring that\njust to keep things consistent.\n\n147\n00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.136\nPaste up,\nwell I accidentally copied an empty line.\n\n148\n00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:56.579\nSo this is mousedown.\n\n149\n00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:58.127\nLike so.\n\n150\n00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:00.850\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna remove this little bit.\n\n151\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.650\nAnd what about this render?\n\n152\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.006\nWell, this is the rendering\nportion of the application.\n\n153\n00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:09.720\nSo I'll go ahead and\npull that inside as well.\n\n154\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.400\nBut I will have to make a change to,\nwell, a chunk of these things.\n\n155\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.700\nSo if I come down there and I look.\n\n156\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.910\nThat is the end of setup.\n\n157\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.250\nNotice this has a small underline.\n\n158\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.380\nThis has a small underline,\nthat means I'm outside of that method.\n\n159\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.780\nAnd people were doing this, such a common\nerror, is they'll accidentally paste\n\n160\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.230\nthings in the wrong places if\nthey're doing some rearrangement.\n\n161\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have the smallest amount of\nexperience with this enough to know.\n\n162\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.676\nI was looking at them like, ooh, wait,\n\n163\n00:08:37.676 --> 00:08:41.871\nwhich closed squiggly do we need\nto be outside of or inside of?\n\n164\n00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.988\nAnd I thought I was on the same\nplace where you were at so-\n\n165\n00:08:45.988 --> 00:08:46.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:48.205\n&gt;&gt; But that, you're talking about,\n\n167\n00:08:48.205 --> 00:08:50.005\nand it's very faint to\nsee it on the monitor.\n\n168\n00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:52.829\nWell, I'm looking at a television\nthat's over across the room.\n\n169\n00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.159\nBut it's right underneath the other\nsquiggly of where that end, yes, okay.\n\n170\n00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:57.934\n&gt;&gt; So we see that blue line.\n\n171\n00:08:57.934 --> 00:09:03.590\nAnd if I scroll up,\nyou'll see another blue line right there.\n\n172\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.414\nAnd it tells you the open, close-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n173\n00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:06.076\n&gt;&gt; Of that portion.\n\n174\n00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and I thought had saw that.\n\n175\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.528\nBut I was just making sure that that\nis what I was needing to look for\n\n176\n00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:14.743\nas wondering, where do we go?\n\n177\n00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:15.619\nWhere are we going?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:18.537\nI know I'm following you,\nI just, which squiggly?\n\n179\n00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:19.391\nI call them squigglies.\n\n180\n00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:22.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, curly braces, squiggly braces.\n\n181\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.090\nI'm sure they have an official name.\n\n182\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.991\nBut I haven't bothered to\nlearn them because, well,\n\n183\n00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:30.157\nall of my substitute names have\nserved my purpose thus far.\n\n184\n00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:34.465\nBut I need to remove this function because\nthis is now a method of this class.\n\n185\n00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:36.450\nAnd, well, if we come back and we refresh,\n\n186\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.880\nthere's no errors because\nI haven't started this.\n\n187\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.130\nI haven't actually made this work yet.\n\n188\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.652\nSo if I come over here.\n\n189\n00:09:43.652 --> 00:09:45.088\nAnd I'm just gonna go through.\n\n190\n00:09:45.088 --> 00:09:49.920\nNotice that this.canvas, this.context,\nthis.points, and this.isDrawing.\n\n191\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.049\nAll of those variables used to be\nglobal using either const or let.\n\n192\n00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:56.335\nWhen now that they're a part\nof this application, well,\n\n193\n00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:59.580\nI'm gonna have to add\na this in front of canvas.\n\n194\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.630\nI need a, this.points in front of push.\n\n195\n00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.630\nAnd this, the keyword this, and the fat\narrow functions that I used in these\n\n196\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.320\nevent handlers,\nnow become incredibly useful.\n\n197\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.528\nThe fat arrow function allows me to\nuse the keyword this in reference to\n\n198\n00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:18.920\nthis application.\n\n199\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.593\nIf I used a normal function and if you're\ndoing these on an older browser, do keep\n\n200\n00:10:23.593 --> 00:10:28.700\nin mind that's going to change what this,\nthe keyword, means inside of the function.\n\n201\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.540\nSo I have some craziness there.\n\n202\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.811\nSo there's this.isDrawing and\nthis.isDrawing, and this.points.\n\n203\n00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:41.533\nAnd this is not so friendly,\nthis.render, just like so.\n\n204\n00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:48.386\nAnd then this.render, and\nthis.isDrawing, and this.points.\n\n205\n00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:51.756\nAnd also all of these\ncontext portions here.\n\n206\n00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:56.765\nNow, in Atom, I'm selecting the first\nthing in a hold command on Mac,\n\n207\n00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:00.537\nCtrl on other platforms, and hit d and\nit will give me the next one.\n\n208\n00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:01.380\nAnd then I hit d again.\n\n209\n00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.280\nAnd it will give the next one.\n\n210\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.300\nSo now I have multiple cursors,\nI just hit this dot.\n\n211\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.000\n&gt;&gt; I saw you do that before and I was\njust like, ooh, that was really exciting.\n\n212\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.667\nAnd I'm like,\nhe's probably talked about this or\n\n213\n00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:11.860\ndemonstrated this before-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.500\n&gt;&gt; On another episode that I haven't seen.\n\n215\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.486\nBut I was just like, that was really cool.\n\n216\n00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:16.379\nI was hoping you would\ntell me what you did.\n\n217\n00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:17.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I try to be explicit\n\n219\n00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:22.356\nabout those just in case, well,\nyou're joining us for the first time.\n\n220\n00:11:22.356 --> 00:11:25.189\nBut every once in a while,\nI am not infallible.\n\n221\n00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:26.260\nI do have a little hiccup.\n\n222\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.790\nAnd, well, I shouldn't forget this.points.\n\n223\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.441\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to\ndo it on the points.x.\n\n224\n00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:36.171\nI'm playing the matching\ngame again [LAUGH] but\n\n225\n00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:38.328\nthat's not applicable here-\n&gt;&gt; So this.points-\n\n226\n00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:38.980\n&gt;&gt; On that one-\n\n227\n00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.666\n&gt;&gt; Is the array.\n\n228\n00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:45.890\nIn the context of this forEach, point is a\ntemporary variable that is a singular one.\n\n229\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.680\nSo I'm moving through the array.\n\n230\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.620\nSo I don't need this., because it\nwill change every time we hit array\n\n231\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.450\nthrough the collection of\npoints that is a part of rest.\n\n232\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy,\nthat actually made sense.\n\n233\n00:11:56.572 --> 00:11:57.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:11:57.825 --> 00:11:59.783\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what, I,\n\n235\n00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:01.680\nmakes me feel good in my heart.\n\n236\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Makes me feel good in my heart.\n\n237\n00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Now that we have this\nkind of rearranged, right?\n\n238\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.960\nWe need to instantiate the application.\n\n239\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.675\nI did change one thing,\nhow we were doing this.\n\n240\n00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:18.720\nDevPaint expects a selector\neffectively over in the index.html.\n\n241\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.240\nWhere's the canvas?\n\n242\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.339\nWhere is all this drawing going to occur?\n\n243\n00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.411\nNotice this is id of canvas.\n\n244\n00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.402\nLet's select canvas query,\ndocument.querySelector,\n\n245\n00:12:27.402 --> 00:12:29.084\nthat's what it used to point at.\n\n246\n00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:36.028\nBut when I create my new application,\nI'm actually going to say,\n\n247\n00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:40.770\nnew DevPaint, and then like so, okay?\n\n248\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.250\nAnd that way, if I wanted to change that,\nif I wanted to have 30 of these, or\n\n249\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.100\nif I needed to reuse this code but\n\n250\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.900\na different selector on a different page,\nthen I could.\n\n251\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.320\nIt's a little nicer.\n\n252\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.370\nNow, I'll probably deviate away from this\nas we're trying to get things done but\n\n253\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.370\nit's something to keep in mind.\n\n254\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.630\nI find this to be a little\nmore readable to me.\n\n255\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.110\nBut, again, that's my personal opinion.\n\n256\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.400\nLet's go see if we actually\nhave this working.\n\n257\n00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.260\nAnd well, look, we're back.\n\n258\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.700\nWe have no errors.\n\n259\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.940\nBut we still do have these\npersistent problems, right?\n\n260\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.549\nNumber one, the offset.\n\n261\n00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:22.495\nNumber two, The continuation.\n\n262\n00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:23.941\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:29.948\nSo all of that is kind of cropping\nup from this.points.push, right?\n\n264\n00:13:29.948 --> 00:13:32.320\nWe're keeping collection of points.\n\n265\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.930\nAnd we're pushing in an object that\nI'm just constructing on the fly.\n\n266\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.390\nThat's kind of hard to read.\n\n267\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.010\nMy intention is not clear.\n\n268\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.640\nIf we came back from a month from now,\nI might understand it.\n\n269\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.301\nBut if Vonne wanted to come back,\neven though she is here, she may go,\n\n270\n00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:47.973\nwhat's an x and y thing?\n\n271\n00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:48.908\nWell it's a point.\n\n272\n00:13:48.908 --> 00:13:52.610\nAnd I want it to be treated like\na point with an x and y coordinate.\n\n273\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.110\nI'm actually gonna do a little\nbit of changes there so\n\n274\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.890\nwe can start to say, okay,\nI see what you're doing.\n\n275\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.284\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna come above DevPaint and\n\n276\n00:14:04.284 --> 00:14:08.148\ncreate a class called,\nnot Paint, called Point.\n\n277\n00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.250\nAnd that's gonna be a constructor.\n\n278\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.255\nAnd it's gonna take an x and a y.\n\n279\n00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:15.698\nAnd I was gonna say is\nwhatever you pass in for\n\n280\n00:14:15.698 --> 00:14:18.010\nx is gonna be set to the x property.\n\n281\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.860\nWhatever you pass in for\ny is gonna be set to the y property.\n\n282\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.020\nAnd let's go check out how\nthat actually plays out.\n\n283\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:31.550\nSo let's say new Point(100,\n100) I still get that object that I'm\n\n284\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:38.150\ncreating in place with curly braces\nexcept, now, I know that it's a point.\n\n285\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.720\nAnd in my code my intention\nwill be conveyed a little,\n\n286\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.670\nI think, a little more\nclearly than it currently is.\n\n287\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.217\nSo let's make the changes,\nnew Point {x, y}, just like that.\n\n288\n00:14:50.217 --> 00:14:54.040\nNope, don't put a semicolon,\nit'll wreck your day, wrecked day.\n\n289\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.190\nLet's change these out.\n\n290\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.230\nAnd new Point {x, y}.\n\n291\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.720\nAnd finally a new point.\n\n292\n00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.020\nLet's keep it consistent,\nnew Point {x, y}.\n\n293\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.240\nOkay, very repetitive.\n\n294\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.300\nWe'll probably clean that up shortly.\n\n295\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.690\nBut now what am I doing?\n\n296\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.415\nI'm pushing into the points\narray a new point.\n\n297\n00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:20.797\nThat's my intention.\n\n298\n00:15:20.797 --> 00:15:21.940\nIt's a small change.\n\n299\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.540\nIt's a subtle change.\n\n300\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.900\nBut now if we come back and\nread this, what is that thing?\n\n301\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.830\nIt's a point.\n\n302\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.930\nIt's not just an object with an x and a y.\n\n303\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.700\nA point is a coordinate.\n\n304\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.190\nAn x position and a y position.\n\n305\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:39.390\nLikewise, I have used that\nconvention to draw my line, right?\n\n306\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.010\nSo the first one has an x and a y.\n\n307\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.632\nAnd those are x and y coordinates.\n\n308\n00:15:43.632 --> 00:15:46.739\nThat still doesn't fix\nany of my problems but\n\n309\n00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:49.856\nit helps me with a little\nbit of readability.\n\n310\n00:15:49.856 --> 00:15:52.992\nAnd just to show you it all still works.\n\n311\n00:15:52.992 --> 00:15:56.860\nAll right,\nlet's tackle problem number one, Vonne.\n\n312\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:02.770\nThat offset from the tip of the, I think\nI can fix this, or at least get closer.\n\n313\n00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:10.220\nOkay, so when I go to add my point,\nI'm just grabbing the x and\n\n314\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220\ny from my event, and\nthe event is on the canvas object.\n\n315\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.030\nSo there's a little bit of wiggle\nroom because of relative spacing or\n\n316\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.140\nrelative positioning and\nthings of that nature.\n\n317\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.822\nReally, really I think\nwe should change these.\n\n318\n00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:31.698\nLet's say, const x = e.x -,\n\n319\n00:16:31.698 --> 00:16:38.228\nI'll get it right in just a moment,\n\n320\n00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:45.630\nand then, this .canvas, right here,\n\n321\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:52.830\nthis.canvas.offsetLeft, right?\n\n322\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.284\nSo I'm looking for\nthe canvases offset from the left.\n\n323\n00:16:57.284 --> 00:17:01.418\nLikewise, I'm looking for y, e.y,\n\n324\n00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:07.561\nwhich is the y position,\nminus this.canvas.offset and\n\n325\n00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:11.520\nnot left, but instead from the top.\n\n326\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.970\nSo essentially,\nI'm taking this point at the x and y.\n\n327\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.580\nI'm just moving it up into the left\n\n328\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.250\nbased on how far the canvas is\noffset relatively speaking.\n\n329\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.090\n&gt;&gt; This may be a weird correlation, but\n\n330\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:30.720\nit's like when you weigh things on a scale\nand you have a tray and you do a tear.\n\n331\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.150\nRight like, just take off,\nokay, the tray is 0.04.\n\n332\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.360\nYou hit the tear button,\nit sets it back to zero, so\n\n333\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.370\nit knows that's how much it is\nthen you put your meat on it.\n\n334\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.800\nYeah, I've-\n&gt;&gt; It is very much similar to that.\n\n335\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.780\nEssentially we're zeroing out a little bit\nof noise, a little bit of [SOUND], right?\n\n336\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.970\nThat little extra.\n\n337\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.030\nAnd hopefully that will fix our problem\nand well, if it doesn't then I don't know.\n\n338\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.330\nWe'll deal with that when and\nif we need to.\n\n339\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:03.280\nSo we come over here, and\nlet's zoom in, that's a little better.\n\n340\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.590\nIt's a little better but\nit's not exactly correct.\n\n341\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:14.840\nAnd let's see here, number one, because\nI haven't made this change everywhere.\n\n342\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.481\nSo let's go ahead and\ngrab this and say [SOUND],\n\n343\n00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:25.841\nlike so, and we're gonna have to fix that.\n\n344\n00:18:25.841 --> 00:18:28.965\nSo there we go and then, likewise.\n\n345\n00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:32.764\n[SOUND] Like those sound effects,\nVonne, that's important.\n\n346\n00:18:32.764 --> 00:18:37.360\nLet's zoom in and see if that works, aha.\n\n347\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.470\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n348\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now it's right at the tip.\n\n349\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:45.610\nAnd full disclosure,\nthere's is e.x and e.pagex and for\n\n350\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.030\nthe most part, those are the same value.\n\n351\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.911\nSo if you see other projects, you're\nstarting to do some research on this x and\n\n352\n00:18:51.911 --> 00:18:55.790\npagex are, in this context,\nexactly the same.\n\n353\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.430\nSo I do have a, I've moved it.\n\n354\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.460\n&gt;&gt; And you're feeling a lot better now,\naren't you?\n\n355\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.170\n&gt;&gt; I am, man, I was getting nervous\nthere for a second because I\n\n356\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.100\nthought that wasn't gonna work,\nand I was gonna run off camera.\n\n357\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.320\nAnd to think about all the decisions\nI made that got me to this poin But\n\n358\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.930\nluckily it worked, but during that it\nreally came to the forefront, right?\n\n359\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.010\nThis is super repetitive, right?\n\n360\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.670\nAt least if I look at this,\nso if this is drawing,\n\n361\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.030\nI really just wanna add a point to\nthe points array, if we're drawing.\n\n362\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.750\nIf I look here, I really just wanna add\na point from an event all the time.\n\n363\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.702\nSee how almost all this\ncode is exactly the same?\n\n364\n00:19:43.702 --> 00:19:46.740\nThat's a good, you know what,\nI should probably change that.\n\n365\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.990\nI should probably abstract that out so\nit's a little more readable.\n\n366\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.100\nSo if someone comes around, me, you, Bond,\n\n367\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.780\nwhoever, at a later time, goes,\nthat's what he meant to do.\n\n368\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI've been with you on enough episodes, so\n\n369\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.970\nit's like, I know where he's going.\n\n370\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.540\nI see repetitive patterns, and\n\n371\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.040\nthat's where you need to do\nwhatever you're gonna do now.\n\n372\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.223\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do a quick\nlittle re-factor here and\n\n373\n00:20:11.223 --> 00:20:16.770\nI'm going to come outside of setup events,\nand I'm gonna say, add point from event.\n\n374\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.660\nI'm just going to pass in\nthe event like that okay?\n\n375\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.930\nAnd then what this is going to do,\nis I'm just gonna grab this,\n\n376\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.880\ncut this, boom, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.720\nAnd now, inside of this event handler,\nadd point from event, and\n\n378\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.210\njust pass in the event.\n\n379\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.360\nNow, I'm doing a lot of mutation,\n\n380\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.970\nit's not necessarily something\nwe always want to do.\n\n381\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.310\nBut now, what does mouse [INAUDIBLE].\n\n382\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.710\nThat adds a point from the event and\nsets it strong to true.\n\n383\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.780\nI don't have to think\nabout all these mechanics.\n\n384\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.840\nLikewise, guess what?\n\n385\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.264\nI'm just gonna delete this and\nsay, add pont from event.\n\n386\n00:20:53.264 --> 00:20:58.240\nThat's the event, just like that,\nthat's it, that's a lot more readable.\n\n387\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.461\nAnd now mouseup,\nit does call a render at the end,\n\n388\n00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.930\nso that's something to keep in mind.\n\n389\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:11.437\nAnd then, likewise,\nif I pull these to the inside and\n\n390\n00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:16.313\nI say paste,\nlet's see if that still works.\n\n391\n00:21:16.313 --> 00:21:21.191\nBecause then we can apply that\nfunction in the very same context,\n\n392\n00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:23.150\ngo refresh, and it does.\n\n393\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.410\nAnd I've went through the whole motion.\n\n394\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.210\nAnd I wanted to check to see if\nmoving that inside broke anything.\n\n395\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.740\nI figured it shouldn't,\nbut you never know.\n\n396\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:39.220\nAnd what that means is I\ncan say addPointFromEvent.\n\n397\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.810\nAnd now,\nif we're drawing addPointFromEvent and\n\n398\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.010\nrender and there we go.\n\n399\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.540\nNow there is some repetition\nwith this render.\n\n400\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:55.640\nMaybe, maybe, we just call that at the end\nof every time we add a new point, right?\n\n401\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.070\nSo let's take this render out.\n\n402\n00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.490\nAnd I think that makes a little more,\nif I added a new point,\n\n403\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.940\nI should probably re-render.\n\n404\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.970\nSo it shouldn't be tied to the event\nhandlers necessarily, it should be tied to\n\n405\n00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:13.060\nchanging how many points we have.\n\n406\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:18.400\nI hope this works, cuz if it doesn't,\nwell, we're going to have to rethink that.\n\n407\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.100\nAnd now we get the exact same thing\nI have render one time because\n\n408\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.620\nit's tied to adding a point\nto the points array.\n\n409\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.250\nThis has cleaned up a great deal.\n\n410\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.520\nI would argue a lot more\nreadable than before because,\n\n411\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.700\nwhat are we doing on mousedown?\n\n412\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.920\nWell, you're gonna add a point to the\narray and gonna say, is drawing to true.\n\n413\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.830\nWhat about mouseup?\n\n414\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.820\nWe're gonna add that final point to\nthe array and say is drawn to false.\n\n415\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.470\nCuz you're no longer drawing..\n\n416\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.740\nWhat about if you're moving?\n\n417\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.990\nWell, if you're drawing,\nadd another point to the array.\n\n418\n00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.020\nEvery time I add a point,\n\n419\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.640\nI want to re-render because I\nhave a new thing to draw, right?\n\n420\n00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.720\nSo now, there's a little bit of\nrefactoring had set us up to go, okay,\n\n421\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.650\nI see where you're going here, I got you.\n\n422\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.090\nWe fixed a problem,\nwe made it a little cleaner.\n\n423\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.800\nA little more easy,\na little easier to read, right?\n\n424\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800\nA little more easy my goodness,\n\n425\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.458\nthat's two comparative forms on it,\ndon't ever do that that's bad.\n\n426\n00:23:14.458 --> 00:23:21.740\nSo if I refresh and I go like this, and\nwe still have that one problem, right?\n\n427\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.130\nAnd I will be honest with you, Vonne,\n\n428\n00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.840\nthis is probably going to have\nto take a little more changes.\n\n429\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.692\nPoints are good, but\nI think I foresee what's going on.\n\n430\n00:23:31.692 --> 00:23:34.170\nWe just keep adding points,\nwe need some way to say,\n\n431\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.740\nthis chunk of points is this line,\nthis chunk of points is this line.\n\n432\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.110\nBut as it stands we're going to have\nto make a fair amount of changes\n\n433\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.290\nto our current code,\nmaybe mess up some of that readability.\n\n434\n00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.210\nBut I don't know if we\nhave time in that episode.\n\n435\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.700\nI know we have a little bit of time, but\n\n436\n00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.685\nwe've got some other thing we've got to do\nto set that up, that's annoying behavior.\n\n437\n00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:59.955\n&gt;&gt; Well, I have faith that I know you\nwill get this done, and you'll show me.\n\n438\n00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:04.211\nAnd I'll be really excited because I'm\nstill following, I'm still understanding.\n\n439\n00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:07.785\nAnd now I’m thinking about deli meat and\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n440\n00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:08.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:12.128\n&gt;&gt; I might be having some chicken tenders\n\n442\n00:24:12.128 --> 00:24:14.195\ntonight for dinner.\n\n443\n00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:15.298\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm, delicioso\n\n444\n00:24:15.298 --> 00:24:16.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you so\n\n445\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:21.000\nmuch for that and\nwe will come back with a part three and\n\n446\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.130\ndo all that stuff you\nsaid we were gonna do.\n\n447\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.950\nI’m excited I hope you’re excited.\n\n448\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.980\nWe’re gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n449\n00:24:26.980 -->

DEVPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:22.020\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nthis is HTML5 Canvas Projects,\n\n4\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.937\nand we're coming back with a part\n3 in our drawing a line objects.\n\n5\n00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:31.229\nOkay, I don't think I've gotten\nthe name of this episode right yet,\n\n6\n00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:36.030\nbut that's okay, I have Mr.\nJustin Dennison here to help me out.\n\n7\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.235\nSo, thank you for coming,\nand what are we doing again?\n\n8\n00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:40.540\nWe're creating a pencil drawing.\n\n9\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.386\n&gt;&gt; Creating a pencil drawing, that is\nour ultimate goal for this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:47.840\nAnd as a developer,\nI am a horrible estimator of time.\n\n11\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.513\nAnd, well,\nyou're definitely seeing this in play.\n\n12\n00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:52.720\nI was like, yes,\none episode and will be done.\n\n13\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.120\nAnd then, here we are in part 3.\n\n14\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.270\nBut, I'm making sure that\nI'm trying to be specific,\n\n15\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.032\nvery transparent about the thought process\nand kinda the process that I go through,\n\n16\n00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:05.350\nwhen I'm working through\nthese respective projects.\n\n17\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.362\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna say I appreciate it,\nbecause, like I told you before,\n\n18\n00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:11.385\nI'm actually understanding this.\n\n19\n00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:16.125\nI'm totally following your logic and\nhow you're doing the refactoring and\n\n20\n00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:20.755\nall, like following the patterns and\nI'm thoroughly enjoying myself.\n\n21\n00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:23.652\nAnd this is right up my ally in my path,\n\n22\n00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:27.921\nbecause I love to draw paths\nin illustrator and points.\n\n23\n00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.647\nSo, maybe that's also\nkind of coming into play.\n\n24\n00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:32.049\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; But you're doing an excellent of\n\n25\n00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:32.730\nexplaining it.\n\n26\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.717\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, thank you.\n\n27\n00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.750\nI'm going to puff up my chest, and\nraise up my chin a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.695\nAnd, well this episode may be, kind of\nthe most exciting for you yet, Vonne.\n\n29\n00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:46.430\nBecause, well, in part 1 we got it\nworking, and there were some rough edges.\n\n30\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.180\nPart 2 we did some refactoring, made it\na little more readable, in my opinion.\n\n31\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.430\nAnd, well, we added the ability\nto offset based on the pointer.\n\n32\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.931\nSo now it actually draws\nwhere your mouse pointer is,\n\n33\n00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:58.385\nat the very tip of the pointer.\n\n34\n00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:01.330\nBut we still did have a persistent issue.\n\n35\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.835\nAnd, well, let's just go ahead and remind\nourselves that the teeth-gritting issue,\n\n36\n00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:06.685\nthat we can see.\n\n37\n00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.770\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n38\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.639\nAnd I'm gonna refresh.\n\n39\n00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:18.280\nAnd all right, everything looks good,\nit is so not good.\n\n40\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.429\n&gt;&gt; And this is also correlating\ninto when I teach Illustrator,\n\n41\n00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:23.415\nwhen somebody's using the pen tool.\n\n42\n00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:26.619\nNow the pen tool works a little bit\ndifferently, mechanically you have to\n\n43\n00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.350\nclick, click, click, but people think,\nI'm ready to go ahead and make a new path.\n\n44\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.782\nBut what I say is you have to\ntell it to stop this path,\n\n45\n00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:39.130\nokay, let's now do a new path.\n\n46\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.310\nSo, it's following along in a program\nthat I do teach and know very well.\n\n47\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.970\nSo, this is like the, you've got\nto stop the path in Illustrator.\n\n48\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.700\nYou've got to stop the pen, and I know\nthat that's what we're going to be doing.\n\n49\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.154\n&gt;&gt; And I think you kind of brought to\nthe forefront exactly what's happening.\n\n50\n00:02:58.154 --> 00:03:01.840\nCurrently we are storing\nall of the points, right?\n\n51\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.282\nLet's go up here and look look\ninside in DevPaint, the application.\n\n52\n00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.860\nWe're storing points continuously.\n\n53\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.560\nTechnically, points are discrete, but\nwe are drawing between them with lines.\n\n54\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.840\nThere's still a line set, we're splitting\nhairs here, so we won't worry about that.\n\n55\n00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.080\nWe're just consistently adding to this.\n\n56\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.913\nThere is never a time that I say,\nall right, all these points are a group.\n\n57\n00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.300\nThese determine the path.\n\n58\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.400\nAnd I want you render those\nindependently of the next path, right?\n\n59\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.689\nSo we've been talking about this path and\nit's been a little bit of a foreshadowing,\n\n60\n00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.630\nkind of, if this is a path,\nthen we could get this to work.\n\n61\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.488\nWell, I think it's probably\ntime we do just that,\n\n62\n00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.889\na collection of points will define a path.\n\n63\n00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.734\nAnd when we have those mouse events within\nour application, I think we can say,\n\n64\n00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:50.829\non mouse down, create a new path,\n\n65\n00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.360\nadd points to said path, and then mouse\nup terminate the path, we're done.\n\n66\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.880\nBut keep that path, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.678\nThe actual path, in our memory, and\n\n68\n00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:05.560\nthen move on to another path, so\nwhen I click I create a new path.\n\n69\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.990\nAnd that's a lot of kind of abstract talk,\nso its probably easier to show ultimately.\n\n70\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.583\n&gt;&gt; It's just a reset,\nlike reset and loop again.\n\n71\n00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:18.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly and this is all\ngonna be kind of based on mouse events.\n\n72\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.440\nWhat does that mean in\nterms of our application?\n\n73\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.240\nWell, it means that a lot of\nthis is not gonna work [LAUGH].\n\n74\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.786\nSo that is okay though, all right?\n\n75\n00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:33.491\nHow is that going to, this don't render,\nwe may find, and this is,\n\n76\n00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:39.210\nI'm always guarded against premature\nkind of refactoring optimization.\n\n77\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.970\nWe may have to pull things out,\nlet's say this function.\n\n78\n00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.752\nThis may not work originally how we\nplanned it, we may have to move it yet\n\n79\n00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:50.820\nagain, or pull it back apart instead\nof the consolidation that we did.\n\n80\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.775\nAnd that's just the name of the game,\nthat's something that happens.\n\n81\n00:04:54.775 --> 00:05:01.090\nLikewise though, I think points is not\ngoing to be stored inside of DevPaint.\n\n82\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.019\nI think we're gonna store paths and\nkeep track of a path one at a time.\n\n83\n00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:09.969\nAnd then the path that\nwe're keeping track of,\n\n84\n00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.190\nis actually going to contain\na collection of points.\n\n85\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.674\nThat was a lot.\n\n86\n00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:20.431\nLet's do this, let me further clarify, and\nthis is gonna be a whole bunch of broke,\n\n87\n00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:23.940\nand I know a lot,\nthis is gonna be broke for a little bit.\n\n88\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.662\nSo I'm gonna say this .path, and I'd\nreally like to say path, that's it, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:34.274\nGot it?\nAnd we may have to modify that, and\n\n90\n00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:37.730\nthen this .paths is a collection.\n\n91\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.150\nSo I'm gonna keep track of all the paths\nthat have been drawn by the user.\n\n92\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.245\nNow what's in this path if I say new path,\nI mean an object?\n\n93\n00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.389\nKinda like this point.\n\n94\n00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.700\nWhat's going to be there?\n\n95\n00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.604\nLet's go ahead and start stubbing that\nout and we'll add and subtract and\n\n96\n00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.019\nprobably no multiply or\ndivide but you never know.\n\n97\n00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.851\nConstructor, and\nlet's just leave that empty for now.\n\n98\n00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:05.373\nAnd we're gonna say this.points, a path is\ngoing to have a collection of points to\n\n99\n00:06:05.373 --> 00:06:07.970\nitself, that's what defines it, all right?\n\n100\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.040\nSo, we no longer need this.points,\njust like that.\n\n101\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.846\nInstead what we want Is\nwe want to say path,\n\n102\n00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:24.270\nlet's say we add a point to\nthe path from an event, okay?\n\n103\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.891\nSo when I pass an event, I don't to create\nsee how we add a point inside a DevPaint.\n\n104\n00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:33.514\nWell, if we're not handling points\nanymore inside of the main application,\n\n105\n00:06:33.514 --> 00:06:38.760\nthis doesn't make any sense inside\nof this application anymore, right?\n\n106\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.868\nWhat we need is actually\nthis to come out to the,\n\n107\n00:06:44.868 --> 00:06:48.852\nwait for it, the path, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:54.419\nSo this.points which is now\ninside of a single path object.\n\n109\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.802\nBut what it also means is that this.render\nis probably not a good place for\n\n110\n00:06:58.802 --> 00:06:59.490\nthis anymore.\n\n111\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.498\nWe don't want to re-render just this one\npath, probably wanna re-render, based\n\n112\n00:07:04.498 --> 00:07:09.657\non the application, when the application\ndecides to re-render everything, okay?\n\n113\n00:07:09.657 --> 00:07:12.645\nSo I'm gonna remove this, all right.\n\n114\n00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:19.220\nSo as you can see, if I refresh,\nwhole bunch of broke, that is never good.\n\n115\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.373\nSo we have to come down here,\nand think about this.\n\n116\n00:07:23.373 --> 00:07:24.610\nWe've created a new path.\n\n117\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.290\nWell, if we say, path.addPointFromEvent,\n\n118\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.912\nwe're now adding it to the path, right?\n\n119\n00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:40.730\nAnd likewise when we mouse up, well,\n\n120\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.645\nwe want to do the final one, and\n\n121\n00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:48.720\nwe may have to come back to that.\n\n122\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.050\nAnd likewise, we're gonna say,\nthis.path.addPointFromEvent, as such.\n\n123\n00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.791\nSo we've made a small modification, and\n\n124\n00:07:56.791 --> 00:07:59.640\nhopefully we can go from an unbroken\nstate, but I make no promises.\n\n125\n00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.312\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about grouping.\n\n126\n00:08:01.312 --> 00:08:04.729\nYou have a group inside a group, and now\nyou've got to take this out through over\n\n127\n00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.467\nhere, But the way that code is written.\n\n128\n00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:09.733\nStill thinking about this group,\nyou gotta think about this group, and\n\n129\n00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:10.487\njust like that.\n\n130\n00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:12.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If only we sock puppets,\n\n131\n00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:13.832\nwe would be doing [INAUDIBLE].\n\n132\n00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:15.300\nBut you're absolutely correct.\n\n133\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.788\nI'm essentially reorganizing to where I\nhave a group of points that define a path,\n\n134\n00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:22.801\nand then the main application\nonly cares about paths and\n\n135\n00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.836\nnot about the individual\npoints that make up said path.\n\n136\n00:08:25.836 --> 00:08:28.199\nSo it's this weird composition hierarchy.\n\n137\n00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:30.201\nNow what do I mean by composition?\n\n138\n00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:34.761\nWell, an object fpaint,\nkeeps track of other objects,\n\n139\n00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:39.810\ncanvas, contexts, paths,\nin order to perform its actions.\n\n140\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:47.100\nLikewise a path object keeps track\nof points to do its actions, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.301\nSo Vonne,\nat any point if I say word you're like\n\n142\n00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.799\nhe's saying words that I'm not sure\nthat everybody knows what they mean.\n\n143\n00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.047\nDefinitely do stop.\n\n144\n00:08:56.047 --> 00:09:00.365\n&gt;&gt; No, it's funny because, not that you\nall know this, but we're talking and\n\n145\n00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.621\ndoing Word earlier and\nwe were talking about hierarchy and\n\n146\n00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:07.096\nlike the heading levels and\nwhat needs to go in which heading.\n\n147\n00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.329\nHeading one and then two,\nthree, and then one, two, three.\n\n148\n00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:13.885\nI'm just, I'm equating it to all\nthe things that kinda make sense in my\n\n149\n00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:16.674\nbrain to as what you're doing,\nand following along and\n\n150\n00:09:16.674 --> 00:09:18.418\nhaving a grand old time over here.\n\n151\n00:09:18.418 --> 00:09:22.419\nAnd I think you're using the terminology,\npretty, pretty okay.\n\n152\n00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:23.302\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n153\n00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:25.325\nWell, I'm gonna,\nI'm gonna stay with it, then.\n\n154\n00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:27.630\nSo lets see here.\n\n155\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.843\nWe should go to a non-broken state\nthat I'm not saying it's gonna render,\n\n156\n00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:37.333\nbut we may get to a non-broken\nstate other than this stop points.\n\n157\n00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:39.086\nThat's not what I want.\n\n158\n00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:47.072\nReally if you think about it this\nrender actually is a path rendering.\n\n159\n00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:49.798\nLet's think about that,\nadd a collection of points and\n\n160\n00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.804\nI wanna reiterate through them and\nactually draw out.\n\n161\n00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:57.715\nWell, what does, this render used\nto be our application render, but\n\n162\n00:09:57.715 --> 00:10:03.558\nnow that I've done this regrouping this\nmore accurately describes a path render.\n\n163\n00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:05.230\nI just cut that out.\n\n164\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.234\nCtrl + X or\nCmd + X depending on your platform.\n\n165\n00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:11.933\nSo a path needs to know how to render,\nright?\n\n166\n00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:14.086\nHow does it draw to the screen?\n\n167\n00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:18.017\nBoom, just like so.\n\n168\n00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:18.894\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n169\n00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:21.222\nYou're playing it,\nI was like which squiggly are we in?\n\n170\n00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:22.134\nIt's in the path.\n\n171\n00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:24.278\nThat's where you put it in.\n\n172\n00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:25.742\nYou grouped it into that.\n\n173\n00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:29.200\nWe're moving the pieces around\ninto the different circles,\n\n174\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.808\nthe groups to know where\nto talk to each other.\n\n175\n00:10:31.808 --> 00:10:32.735\n&gt;&gt; Yup, exactly.\n\n176\n00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:36.391\nAnd that's one of those pattern\nrecognition things that really,\n\n177\n00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:40.580\nwhat I originally had was actually\ndrawing a line between a bunch of points.\n\n178\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.284\nWell, what is it?\n\n179\n00:10:41.284 --> 00:10:43.668\nThat's actually how a path\nshould be rendered.\n\n180\n00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:46.762\nBut now that we have that,\nwe can't render out here, but\n\n181\n00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:48.832\nit should keep things from breaking.\n\n182\n00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:55.422\nOther than the fact that we're gonna have\nto address, see how this .context exists?\n\n183\n00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.910\nIt doesn't exist inside a path.\n\n184\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.165\nSo path knows nothing about context.\n\n185\n00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:00.842\nWe'll have to fix that.\n\n186\n00:11:00.842 --> 00:11:04.163\nBut, we'll fix that, and\nthere's a couple of ways to do that.\n\n187\n00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.123\nBut that's all right.\n\n188\n00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.914\nI do want to explore.\n\n189\n00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:12.146\nCannot read offset left of undefined.\n\n190\n00:11:12.146 --> 00:11:13.539\nWhy is that?\n\n191\n00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.153\nLook at that.\n\n192\n00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:16.594\nCanvas.\n\n193\n00:11:16.594 --> 00:11:20.024\nThe path doesn't know about\nthe canvas anymore either.\n\n194\n00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:23.211\nThat is unfortunate.\n\n195\n00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:28.574\nHowever let me,\nI'm about to get tricky on this one.\n\n196\n00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:30.462\nI'm going to console log this out.\n\n197\n00:11:30.462 --> 00:11:34.643\nIf I refresh, and I do that,\nnotice this mouse event.\n\n198\n00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:39.153\nIf I come down here, and I look,\nsee that target attributed the event?\n\n199\n00:11:39.153 --> 00:11:43.310\nMost of the time events\ncarry on what they need?\n\n200\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.089\nSo what originated this event?\n\n201\n00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:48.560\nThat's actually what I need.\n\n202\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:56.057\nSo I can say E.Target.offsetLeft\nright there.\n\n203\n00:11:56.057 --> 00:11:57.665\nOffsetTop.\n\n204\n00:11:57.665 --> 00:12:01.100\nSo because I'm using an event,\nI don't need to pass in the canvas or\n\n205\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.835\ndo all kinds of crazy stuff\nto let the path know about.\n\n206\n00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:06.776\nIt only needs to process the events.\n\n207\n00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:11.745\nAnd, you're like,\nwell that's a lot of redirection there,\n\n208\n00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:16.620\nthat's all right, that's all right,\nwe'll make sure, so\n\n209\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.870\ne.target, and e.target,\nor the event, like so.\n\n210\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.322\nNow, what is the target?\n\n211\n00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:27.127\nWell, we're always processing the canvas,\nand I'm making this choice\n\n212\n00:12:27.127 --> 00:12:31.873\nrealistically we should probably be\na little more explicit about that.\n\n213\n00:12:31.873 --> 00:12:35.874\nThat should actually make those\nareas go away, and it does.\n\n214\n00:12:35.874 --> 00:12:37.586\nI actually just clicked and moved.\n\n215\n00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:38.461\nLet's go look.\n\n216\n00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:45.546\nI'm going to save this to a variable so\nI can inspect it.\n\n217\n00:12:45.546 --> 00:12:47.828\nSo I refresh and do that.\n\n218\n00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:51.883\nAnd now if I look at app.path,\nlook at that.\n\n219\n00:12:51.883 --> 00:12:54.442\nA path has a bunch of points in it.\n\n220\n00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.649\nSo it is logging this.\n\n221\n00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.377\nLet's look at those points.\n\n222\n00:12:57.377 --> 00:13:00.732\nWell, those points have x, y, and\nnotice they are different x, y.\n\n223\n00:13:00.732 --> 00:13:03.800\nSo if we could render this path,\n\n224\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.265\nthen we should be able to\nrender something on the screen.\n\n225\n00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:10.649\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n226\n00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:15.016\nSo, let's see here.\n\n227\n00:13:15.016 --> 00:13:17.088\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n228\n00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.917\nThis dot path, that render.\n\n229\n00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:21.218\nNow, we haven't gotten\nto a bunch of paths yet.\n\n230\n00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:24.454\nI'm just rendering this in particular one.\n\n231\n00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:26.914\nThis is going to break.\n\n232\n00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:30.858\nAnd that's because the path\ndoesn't know what to draw on.\n\n233\n00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.996\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways to fix this.\n\n234\n00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:35.608\nI can either add the context here and\n\n235\n00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:39.877\nshare that reference between\nevery path that's made, or\n\n236\n00:13:39.877 --> 00:13:45.361\nI can come back out and just say, well,\nany kind of collection of objects,\n\n237\n00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:50.355\nany sub object or object that paint\nis using to accomplish its goal?\n\n238\n00:13:50.355 --> 00:13:52.919\nI can pass into its method, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.843\nAnd I've done this both ways.\n\n240\n00:13:55.843 --> 00:14:00.288\nWhat we're going to do is remove this,\nexcept for this point right here,\n\n241\n00:14:00.288 --> 00:14:03.886\nthat actually needs to stay but\nI didn't want to do with it.\n\n242\n00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:06.781\nSo I just removed this, and\nnow I'm gonna pass in context.\n\n243\n00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:09.830\nWell, where's the context coming from,\nthe drawing context?\n\n244\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.122\nIt's gonna come in from\nthe main application.\n\n245\n00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:16.522\nSo, I'm just, I'm essentially,\nlending the path the context so\n\n246\n00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.693\nit can drawl, or render itself.\n\n247\n00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.772\nBut when is this render going to happen?\n\n248\n00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:25.888\nFor kind of dramatic effect,\nlet's just do it on mouse up, so,\n\n249\n00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:29.190\nyou won't see anything until\nI let go of the mouse.\n\n250\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.102\nLet's see if that works out so I refresh.\n\n251\n00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:37.030\nAnd look at that there's my first path.\n\n252\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.611\n&gt;&gt; The whole like it was you were drawing\nit at first I was like it didn't work.\n\n253\n00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:45.983\nBecause you just said it's not going to\nshow up until you let go because that's\n\n254\n00:14:45.983 --> 00:14:49.309\nwhere you put the render is on\nthe mouse up, not on the move.\n\n255\n00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:50.566\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n256\n00:14:50.566 --> 00:14:52.669\nSo all right.\n\n257\n00:14:52.669 --> 00:14:55.002\nHow does that work?\n\n258\n00:14:55.002 --> 00:14:56.275\nYou know what?\nIt's still connecting.\n\n259\n00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:57.737\nAnd why is that?\n\n260\n00:14:57.737 --> 00:15:00.068\nWe have the perfect set up.\n\n261\n00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:03.694\nEverything's kind of ready to go now.\n\n262\n00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.613\nExcept for\na couple of small little tweaks.\n\n263\n00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:09.303\nNumber one, I'm never changing a path.\n\n264\n00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:14.898\nWhen I mouse up I actually want to\npush the current path into this array.\n\n265\n00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:19.660\nI'm gonna say, all right, so\nthis path's done we're gonna save that for\n\n266\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.622\nlater and\nthen I wanna create a new one, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:29.836\nLikewise, well render is probably best put\nsomewhere else, [LAUGH] in all actuality.\n\n268\n00:15:29.836 --> 00:15:33.185\nSo let's see here.\n\n269\n00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:38.263\nHow do I go about,\nwhen I mouse up I wanna say,\n\n270\n00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:42.688\nthis.paths.push(this.path).\n\n271\n00:15:42.688 --> 00:15:47.961\nAll right, so when I, this one in the bag,\nwe'll worry about it later.\n\n272\n00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:53.444\nThen I wanna say this.path = new Path,\nlike so, all right.\n\n273\n00:15:53.444 --> 00:15:55.819\nSo now I have a whole separate one.\n\n274\n00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:56.658\nI've cut the grouping.\n\n275\n00:15:56.658 --> 00:16:00.853\nThat should alone help me separate\nthe two drawing portions, so\n\n276\n00:16:00.853 --> 00:16:04.590\nI should be able to mouse up and\nthen start drawing again.\n\n277\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.700\nOkay.\n\n278\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.558\n&gt;&gt; You don't need to flip the render and\nthe mouse move or\n\n279\n00:16:09.558 --> 00:16:12.920\nmy, on their own path [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, you're on the right path.\n\n280\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.130\nWe actually need a render in\na couple of spots I think.\n\n281\n00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:24.035\nSo I think mouse down, mouse up and-\n&gt;&gt; Because it has to\n\n282\n00:16:24.035 --> 00:16:29.030\nrender when you push the mouse down, so it\nknows add the first point, I should say.\n\n283\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.041\nAnd also on the move?\n\n284\n00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:31.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.420\nI'm close?\n\n286\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.080\n&gt;&gt; I think it's probably gonna be best\nto do it in all three places, right?\n\n287\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.247\nNow I forewarned you,\n\n288\n00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:41.752\nwe actually pulled that out of\nmost of those places in part two.\n\n289\n00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:42.860\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n290\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.430\n&gt;&gt; But, now the renders that we're talking\nabout are a little bit different because I\n\n291\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.620\nneed the ability to\nrender individual paths.\n\n292\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.291\nThe application itself needs to render\nitself which is rendering all the paths\n\n293\n00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:54.075\nevery time.\n\n294\n00:16:54.075 --> 00:16:57.260\nNow this is not the most efficient,\nfull disclosure here.\n\n295\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.443\nIf you kept drawing for crazy amounts\nof time, you may see some slow down.\n\n296\n00:17:02.443 --> 00:17:08.050\nHowever, this is a toy\nkind of application.\n\n297\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:13.089\nSo I think this.render goes here.\n\n298\n00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:20.140\nI think it should also this.render here,\nand likewise.\n\n299\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.165\nIt should only render\nif something updates.\n\n300\n00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:29.560\nI think that's a good one, is that right?\n\n301\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.480\nThere's one way to find out,\nto check it, right?\n\n302\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:39.180\nSo if I refresh,\ncannot read property of undefined render.\n\n303\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.371\nWell that's on 24, look at that.\n\n304\n00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:50.605\nSo now this.path.render we're\nrendering that first path.\n\n305\n00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:55.760\nAnd when we reset it, we're back into\nsome issues that we had in part one.\n\n306\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.330\nWhen we reset it to a new path,\n\n307\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.380\nit can't render itself because the first\npoint doesn't exist for the new one.\n\n308\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.590\nRight here, so this.path equals new path.\n\n309\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.080\nHow many points does that path contain?\n\n310\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.580\nNone, or\n\n311\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.110\nif I come back up here to the path, I made\nthe assumption that it has at least one.\n\n312\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.150\nSo that's a problem, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.629\nSo, right here, inside of this path,\nthis.points when I create the new one,\n\n314\n00:18:22.629 --> 00:18:23.867\nthere's nothing.\n\n315\n00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:27.940\nSo first, is undefined.\n\n316\n00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.080\nFirst.x, it breaks.\n\n317\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.090\nWell, before you get crazy and\n\n318\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.340\nstart messing with that, I don't wanna\njust render the most current one.\n\n319\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.178\nI want to re-render all of the paths\nthat I've collected over my\n\n320\n00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:45.789\ndrawing fun times just like this.\n\n321\n00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:55.324\nThis.paths.forEach.\n\n322\n00:18:55.324 --> 00:19:01.424\nAnd for each of those paths,\npath.render in passing the context.\n\n323\n00:19:01.424 --> 00:19:03.740\nSo only the ones that I've kept.\n\n324\n00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:11.360\nNow, we'll have to do some things,\nso nothing.\n\n325\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:18.647\nI think I have a typo somewhere,\nthis.context is not defined.\n\n326\n00:19:18.647 --> 00:19:22.780\nSorry, there we go.\n\n327\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.030\nThere's one, there's two,\nand they are separated.\n\n328\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.891\nBut we still have one final issue, right?\n\n329\n00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:35.347\nWhat is it?\n\n330\n00:19:35.347 --> 00:19:38.180\nLet's see here.\n\n331\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.071\nI need to render the current path as well.\n\n332\n00:19:43.071 --> 00:19:46.420\nSo I wanted to make sure that\nthat didn't solve our problem.\n\n333\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.270\nReally, what I want is I only want this\nrender to run, if the path has points.\n\n334\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:03.260\nSo if there's no xy points that define it,\nit is empty upon construction.\n\n335\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.770\nI don't want it to do anything.\n\n336\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.923\nSo little bit of hackiness here,\n\n337\n00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:16.041\nif(|this.points) return.\n\n338\n00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:18.770\nJust stop doing this if\nthere's no points available.\n\n339\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.366\nAnd that way we keep running into\nundefined and throwing errors.\n\n340\n00:20:23.366 --> 00:20:29.785\nWe may come back and fix this but\nI wanna see if this works.\n\n341\n00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:34.712\nCuz now because it's handling error\ninternally, every time I re-render,\n\n342\n00:20:34.712 --> 00:20:37.150\nI wanna render all of the store paths.\n\n343\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:44.302\nThe ones in the sacho, but I also want\nto render the current drawn path.\n\n344\n00:20:44.302 --> 00:20:47.791\nAnd this.context.\n\n345\n00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:51.480\nSo oops, and there we go.\n\n346\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.500\nWe're close.\n\n347\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.780\nThere we go.\n\n348\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.880\nAnd lets see where that's coming at.\n\n349\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.200\nI think I got a typo here.\n\n350\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.560\nMight have a little live action debugging.\n\n351\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.524\nIf we come back, if not this.points.\n\n352\n00:21:07.524 --> 00:21:10.806\nFirst so,\nI thought that was gonna fix it but\n\n353\n00:21:10.806 --> 00:21:15.760\nsometimes the best laid plans\ndo not come to fruition.\n\n354\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.100\nLet's do this.\n\n355\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.800\nLet's look at the app's\ncurrent path of variable.\n\n356\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.350\nThere's no points.\n\n357\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:31.632\nSo it shouldn't.\n\n358\n00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:34.557\nLet's just do this.\n\n359\n00:21:34.557 --> 00:21:38.678\nIf the length === 0,\n\n360\n00:21:38.678 --> 00:21:42.808\nthere's none in there.\n\n361\n00:21:42.808 --> 00:21:46.750\nInstead of using the truth e false e,\nbecause sometimes I mess that up.\n\n362\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.440\nRefresh.\n\n363\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.270\nThere we go.\n\n364\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.240\nIt just wasn't checking right.\n\n365\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.090\nIt was evaluating oddly.\n\n366\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:59.265\nBut now, Vonne, we have\na collection of paths that notice I\n\n367\n00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:05.331\nstill have some weirdness if I scroll out-\n&gt;&gt; If you go beyond the canvas,\n\n368\n00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:12.030\nit's not like stopping the path cuz you're\nstill holding the mouse button down.\n\n369\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.567\nSo it's still doing exactly\nwhat you told it to\n\n370\n00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:15.071\n&gt;&gt; And it is and\n\n371\n00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:18.837\nactually it will sometimes.\n\n372\n00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:24.330\nSometimes it will keep the mouse down a\nbit like its drawing will never be undone.\n\n373\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.400\nSo, it'll always-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like how it's connecting\n\n374\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.780\nthat bottom where it's drawing across\nthe bottom of the canvas to kinda\n\n375\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.318\nsay where you're coming back in.\n\n376\n00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:35.490\nI'm gonna connect because I'm\non the canvas, basically.\n\n377\n00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:41.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so that's one of those\nthings where as your mouse is moving.\n\n378\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.513\nHow would I fix that?\n\n379\n00:22:42.513 --> 00:22:46.423\nI'm not gonna fix it right now because we\nmay find that some of the other changes\n\n380\n00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:49.460\nthat we haven't planned may\nchange how that behaves.\n\n381\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.362\nBut if this is the point that I wanted to\nchange it, then I'm gonna come right here.\n\n382\n00:22:54.362 --> 00:22:57.630\nAnd instead of adding point from event.\n\n383\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.063\nAnd see this is drawing as true,\nis drawing as false.\n\n384\n00:23:01.063 --> 00:23:05.061\nI'm gonna add a little bit of logic\nthere to determine whether true and\n\n385\n00:23:05.061 --> 00:23:09.570\nfalse were changed, to determine is\nit is outside of the canvas area.\n\n386\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.880\nSo even if I had a mousedown,\nright, or a mousemove.\n\n387\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.460\nSo actually it would probably\nbe easiest in mousemove.\n\n388\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.694\nIf this is drawing, if the event is\noutside of the canvas area, right?\n\n389\n00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:25.543\n&gt;&gt; Switch that to.\n\n390\n00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.430\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Cut it off.\n\n393\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.550\nOr as soon as it hits the boundaries,\ncut it off.\n\n394\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.200\nBut like I said,\n\n395\n00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.180\nI made you some additional changes that\nchange how this behave a little bit.\n\n396\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.492\n&gt;&gt; Would you have to then tell like\nwhen it comes back into the canvas or\n\n397\n00:23:38.492 --> 00:23:40.650\nI guess it's already in there?\n\n398\n00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.660\n&gt;&gt; I would probably just cut it off and\nsay, even if you're holding on the button,\n\n399\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.330\nonce you hit an edge, I'm gonna cut\nthe drawing off and define the path.\n\n400\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.407\nAnd then that way,\nyou can come back and click-\n\n401\n00:23:48.407 --> 00:23:50.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like you as the user,\n\n402\n00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:54.217\nyou realize it's not gonna continue,\nso you let go of the mouse,\n\n403\n00:23:54.217 --> 00:23:57.460\nand then you come back in,\nand click and draw again.\n\n404\n00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.400\n&gt;&gt; That's probably how I would handle it.\n\n405\n00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.130\nBut, awesomely, that's up to you.\n\n406\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.914\nOr possibly to you,\ndepending on whoever is making this.\n\n407\n00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, then, I would come back to you.\n\n408\n00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.660\n[LAUGH] Well, is there anything else\nthat we need to wrap this up with?\n\n409\n00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.389\n&gt;&gt; I think that's actually\na pretty good stopping point,\n\n410\n00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:15.094\nbecause we've applied a fair\nmount of abstractions.\n\n411\n00:24:15.094 --> 00:24:19.299\nWe went from, it just kind of works too,\nand application with points too.\n\n412\n00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:21.370\nWell, the points are still\nkinda messed up.\n\n413\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.060\nLet's take the points and\nbundle them together into paths\n\n414\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.930\nthat are a collection of points\nthat are now multiple objects.\n\n415\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.050\nWe may do some additional clean up in\nthe future, but we're able to draw and\n\n416\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.990\nI think this is gonna make\nour life a little bit easier.\n\n417\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.810\nOr maybe adding color,\nmaybe being able to clear,\n\n418\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.780\nright, who knows adding patterns or\ndifferent tools.\n\n419\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.216\nI make no promises about polygon tools,\nVonne, to be honest.\n\n420\n00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:46.650\nIt's actually kind of hard.\n\n421\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.100\nOr fill buckets, believe it or\nnot fill buckets are really hard.\n\n422\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.718\nThis determine what to pass bound an area\nand being able to like paint bucket fill.\n\n423\n00:24:54.718 --> 00:24:57.014\n&gt;&gt; Make a close point where\nyou can actually fill it in.\n\n424\n00:24:57.014 --> 00:24:58.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n425\n00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:00.291\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nin Illustrate we call that gap options but\n\n426\n00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.856\n[LAUGH] totally different program.\n\n427\n00:25:01.856 --> 00:25:06.030\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about,\nVonne, [LAUGH] but we'll go with it.\n\n428\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.727\n&gt;&gt; Well, I actually totally knew what\nyou were talking about this whole time.\n\n429\n00:25:09.727 --> 00:25:12.660\nSo like I said before,\nI'm feeling pretty good about this.\n\n430\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.740\nAnd that was really exciting.\n\n431\n00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.810\nSo I hope you all found\nit as exciting as I did.\n\n432\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:23.300\nBut I think this is a true, real we're\ngonna wrap this one up, isn't it?\n\n433\n00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthere is no part four to this.\n\n434\n00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:28.670\nWe're gonna come back with some\ndifferent things next time.\n\n435\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, well,\nthat was a lot of fun.\n\n436\n00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:31.895\nSo thank you.\n\n437\n00:25:31.895 --> 00:25:33.215\nSo wrapping it on up.\n\n438\n00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:35.193\nWe're gonna sign off for DevPro TV.\n\n439\n00:25:35.193 --> 00:25:36.565\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n440\n00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:38.397\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n",

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.660\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.980\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore HTML 5 canvas projects.\n\n5\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.890\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about adding color selections,\n\n6\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.110\nwhich is gonna be fantastic,\nas long as pink and purple.\n\n7\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.560\nSo here to help us is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.740\nHello, how are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic and well.\n\n10\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.470\nI'm not only going to be pink and\npurple, I think there's going be\n\n11\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.830\na lot that you will appreciate in this\nepisode, but I want to keep it a secret.\n\n12\n00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.590\nHow are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.740\nI'm very excited about color.\n\n15\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.825\nYou know I love me some color.\n\n16\n00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm curious to know,\n\n17\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.350\nwhere you are going with color selections,\nmeaning, we can select color or\n\n18\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.870\nwe can apply colors?\n\n19\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.490\nThat's where I'm a little, where are we?\n\n20\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, it may not be as full\nfledged as some of the things that\n\n21\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.760\nyou've used before, right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.222\nSo in Illustrator or Photoshop,\nI'm not here to reproduce\n\n23\n00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:12.290\nlots of heavily worked software\nthat's been around for a while.\n\n24\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.880\nBut I've been playing with the application\nthat we built over the last few episodes,\n\n25\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.630\nbeing able to draw.\n\n26\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.790\nWe have separate paths now,\nwe fixed some of the issues,\n\n27\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.340\nwe did a little bit of cleanup.\n\n28\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.880\nAnd if you have no idea\nwhat I'm talking about,\n\n29\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.445\ndefinitely go check out those episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:28.770\nAnd it's just always\nblack pencil drawings,\n\n31\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.030\nwhich there's nothing wrong with.\n\n32\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500\nI enjoy a good pen and ink drawing,\na graphite drawing, but\n\n33\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.400\nsometimes you need\na little splash of color.\n\n34\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.800\nSo, I was thinking would it be\nhard to the add the ability for\n\n35\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.470\na user to select a color prior\nto drawing a path, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.070\nSo, that's the difference.\n\n37\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.540\nI'm not giving the ability\nto alter a path color but\n\n38\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.320\ninstead choose it prior to drawing.\n\n39\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.860\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like picking the color\ncrayon that you want to draw and then\n\n40\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.700\nyou draw and that becomes the color that\nyou drew because that's what you picked.\n\n41\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.216\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n42\n00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:07.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So purple.\n\n43\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.680\nWhy's this purple?\n\n44\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.870\nNo, you picked purple so\nthat's what it is.\n\n45\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.140\nAnd it's gonna be default.\n\n46\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.820\nNow, this could be extended a great deal.\n\n47\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.810\nBut, that's kind of my simplified view\nof how I would go about achieving this.\n\n48\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.730\nSo, let's go see where we are,\n\n49\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.790\nand think about how that plan fits into\nthe application that we have at hand.\n\n50\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.750\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n51\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.200\nAnd well, here's my nice,\nmy nice little drawing pattern,\n\n52\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.370\nyeah, I can draw separate paths and\nthat's working well.\n\n53\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.860\nNow what I'm thinking is let's say\nthat I wanted a red line next.\n\n54\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.110\nI would like to come up here maybe,\nright, up here and\n\n55\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.880\nselect a button,\nthat allows me to pick a color, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.180\nNow, based on that color choice, then my\nnext line, my path, would be that color.\n\n57\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.490\nSo that's what I'm thinking as\nfar as the user interactions go.\n\n58\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.000\n&gt;&gt; So is this gonna be like a drop\ndown menu that you click and\n\n59\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.311\nit'll drop down and have the words,\nor are we talking buttons?\n\n60\n00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:11.535\nI'm so curious.\n\n61\n00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:12.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n62\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.130\nI'm not gonna divulge my secret quite yet,\n\n63\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.200\nbecause you maybe pleasantly surprised\nwith some of the new advents in HTML 5.\n\n64\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.170\nSo let's go ahead and get it started and\nsee how it kinda turns out.\n\n65\n00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.040\nSo, let's go and look at our code here and\nthere's something,\n\n66\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.350\nthat right now our code\ndoes not address color.\n\n67\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.710\nAll of our paths, though they do render,\n\n68\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.420\nthere's nothing that\ndefines a path's color.\n\n69\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.993\nLikewise, there's no internal state\nof our application that holds\n\n70\n00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.580\nthe color that we have selected, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:55.303\nSo what does that mean?\n\n72\n00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:58.190\nThat means that we're probably\ngoing to have to add a field here.\n\n73\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.860\nEquals, and let's just say we\nkeep the default as black.\n\n74\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.590\nSo we need a color.\n\n75\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.979\nNow, that's the application state.\n\n76\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.880\nWhat about the path?\n\n77\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.370\nThe path still doesn't know\nabout the color that is selected\n\n78\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.940\nat the time that the path was started,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.330\nSo we come up here.\n\n80\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.957\nHere's what I'm thinking.\n\n81\n00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:25.062\nI'm thinking we can say color and\nthen we're gonna say this.color = color.\n\n82\n00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:33.330\nAnd what that allow us to do is pass in a\ncolor Win when we make a selection, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.950\nNow, I could put a default field\nin here like a default value\n\n84\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.160\nbased on new JavaScript features.\n\n85\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.402\nBut I think I'm going to let\nthe application maintain that state and\n\n86\n00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:51.340\nthen just pass along the information\nto the path objects for later use.\n\n87\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.750\nNow, in order to get those to work,\n\n88\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.620\nwe probably need to set the line style,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.060\nThe stroke style, rather,\ninside of this context.\n\n90\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.210\nSo right after this save, I'm going\nto say context.stroke stock, whoa,\n\n91\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.488\nthat is not how you spell that.\n\n92\n00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:15.140\nThis.color, and now,\n\n93\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.870\nnow we will always get whatever\ncolors parsed into the pen.\n\n94\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.820\nNow, I'm gonna do a quick little hack,\njust to see if my line of\n\n95\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.770\nthought works for\ncoloring the paths, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.860\nSo instead of the past in variable,\nyou know what?\n\n97\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.030\nLets go with pink.\n\n98\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.650\nAnd if I refresh, look at that.\n\n99\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.810\nI now have pink drawing.\n\n100\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.110\nAnd if I come back and I change this to,\nwhat was you're other one, purple?\n\n101\n00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Purple.\n\n102\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.990\n&gt;&gt; Purple.\nLet's go to purple, refresh.\n\n103\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.400\nAnd so we now have purple, so\nthat line of thinking does work but\n\n104\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.530\nit still doesn't work from\na user interaction perspective.\n\n105\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm satisfied, I got pink and\npurple, and you made an L right there.\n\n106\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.580\nSo I'm good,\nwe should just go ahead and stop, no.\n\n107\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now\n\n108\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.450\nyou're gonna have to modify\nthe code to get what you want.\n\n109\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.789\nAnd maybe you wanna have pink and\npurple, and both on the same canvas.\n\n110\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.820\nI don't know.\n\n111\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.070\nRight now, it's kind of like\nwhatever crayon you picked,\n\n112\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.870\nsomeone taped your hand up and\nwas like that's the crayon you get.\n\n113\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.560\nThat's all you got.\n\n114\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.270\nSo, all right, we know this works.\n\n115\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.590\nLet's change this back to\nwhatever is passed in.\n\n116\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.790\nNow, these path objects\nare being constructed\n\n117\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.470\ninside of the main application.\n\n118\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.500\nWhen are they being constructed?\n\n119\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.790\nWell, they're being\nconstructed right here.\n\n120\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.210\nSo it's probably best if I'm\ngoing to pass in a color,\n\n121\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.020\nit's gonna be whatever\nthe default color is.\n\n122\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.850\nSo I'm gonna move this just because I\nneed, well, some way to pass in a color.\n\n123\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.260\nI'm just gonna move it so I can say,\ncreate a new path with this color, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.960\nSo be default,\nthat's gonna give me a black.\n\n125\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.890\nIf I come down and I look for\nother places where I saw, new path.\n\n126\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.470\nWell, there's new path.\n\n127\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.641\nAnd this.color, and\nnow when I create a new path,\n\n128\n00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.770\nI'll get whatever color it is, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.700\nAll right,\nwe may find that causes some issues.\n\n130\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:31.190\nWe may have to move when we create the new\npath, based on when we select the color.\n\n131\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.180\nCuz if I select the color,\nthe new path is being created on mouse up,\n\n132\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.030\nI would have to select draw something and\nthen,\n\n133\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.550\nand then draw something again\nbefore I get the color change.\n\n134\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.930\nSo we're probably gonna have to move that,\nbut\n\n135\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.530\nwe just wanna see if the line\nof thinking works out.\n\n136\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.920\nNow, this should work.\n\n137\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.073\nShould is a strong word there.\n\n138\n00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:55.214\nHowever, as it stands there's no way for\n\n139\n00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:59.452\nan interaction from the user\nto decide what color it is.\n\n140\n00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:02.296\nSo if we come over to our index.html, and\n\n141\n00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:07.680\nthis is where I'm kinda gonna depart\nfrom keeping everything encapsulated.\n\n142\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.790\nFor now, I'm just going to use\nan input and what is the type input.\n\n143\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.727\nBelieve it or not,\nthere's a color input in HTML5.\n\n144\n00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:22.740\n[LAUGH] Vaughan is giving\nme the strong eyebrow look.\n\n145\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.650\nAnd let's just call it swatch.\n\n146\n00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.680\nI dont know if that's the best term\nVaughan, you may be grimacing on that.\n\n147\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.520\nBut I'm gonna go with swatch because\nI worked in the paint industry for\n\n148\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.230\na while and that's how I selected colors.\n\n149\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.880\n&gt;&gt; This is actually bringing something\nback to me because I kinda departed,\n\n150\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.530\nif you wanna say, the coding world when\nHTML5 was just getting started in a sense.\n\n151\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.380\nAnd so, I was like, I do remember that.\n\n152\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.773\nAnd thinking, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:48.773 --> 00:08:51.009\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:53.048\n&gt;&gt; So this isn't gonna have a label yet,\n\n155\n00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:54.910\nwe'll worry about that shortly.\n\n156\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.370\nMaybe that's a clean up.\n\n157\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.610\nAnd notice where it is.\n\n158\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.860\nIt's down here on the right.\n\n159\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.330\nSo I'm going to move this because\nthat's not where I want it.\n\n160\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.770\nI actually want it above this portion.\n\n161\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.420\nAnd then, boom, you notice that.\n\n162\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.570\nInputs are inline elements\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n163\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.980\nSo they're not going to\nbreak to the next line.\n\n164\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.750\nSo just to keep that all squared away,\n\n165\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.199\nI'm just going to create a div,\ndivs on divs on divs.\n\n166\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.690\nAnd put that inside as\na manner of dividing up.\n\n167\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.680\nSo now we have this, here's the cool part.\n\n168\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.910\nI haven't wired up anything so\nthis is not gonna work.\n\n169\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.090\nI now have the ability, and\nthis is platform-specific, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.790\nSo on Mac you kinda get\nthe circle color selection.\n\n171\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.706\nOn Linux,\nyou get more of a square with the drag and\n\n172\n00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:51.436\nthings are on the right with your relative\nRGB and A values, or alpha channel values.\n\n173\n00:09:51.436 --> 00:09:53.534\n&gt;&gt; Windows you get like the bricks.\n\n174\n00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:55.810\nI call them bricks,\nthe little boxes, basically.\n\n175\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.620\nAnd it goes to, like you're saying,\nthe operating system,\n\n176\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.390\nit's like what you get in Paint.\n\n177\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.290\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever kind of\n\n178\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.240\npaint application and I know in Mac\nyou've got all of those little buttons\n\n179\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.490\nacross the top that you can change\ninto crayons and everything.\n\n180\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.930\n&gt;&gt; And with Mac you actually have\nsome other selections where I can\n\n181\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.430\nsay I want RGB sliders, so I could\nselect the color with RGB sliders, or\n\n182\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.630\nwith the hex color code, or\nI could go to predefined Apple colors.\n\n183\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.070\nOr, I can just go to the spectrum and\nkind of move around.\n\n184\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.359\nThis actually looks more like the lynx\nversion which you get by default.\n\n185\n00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:29.990\nAnd then here,\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite.\n\n186\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can just grab a colored pencil and\n\n187\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.720\nthese are all handy but\nthis is platform specific so depending,\n\n188\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.340\nif you are following along,\nthis may look different for you.\n\n189\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I say crayons but\nthey were colored pencils or\n\n190\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.690\nmaybe they were crayons at one point.\n\n191\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.440\n&gt;&gt; Isn't a pencil a crayon?\n\n192\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.446\nAnd, I don't know, who knows.\n\n193\n00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:48.990\n&gt;&gt; Crayon?\n\n194\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.400\n&gt;&gt; I might be making that up so\ndon't go with me on that.\n\n195\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.011\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fancy though, I like that.\n\n196\n00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:53.829\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n197\n00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:58.890\nnow we can select a color but\nit doesn't change anything just yet.\n\n198\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.530\nSo, just to show you,\nI'm gonna color here.\n\n199\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.840\nI'm gonna select red.\n\n200\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.600\nAnd notice this represents\nwhat color you select and\n\n201\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.520\nI'll just close out and it stays.\n\n202\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.060\nWell, if I draw, it's not red,\nwhy is it not red?\n\n203\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.590\nBecause I need the ability\nto capture that value.\n\n204\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.790\n&gt;&gt; You gotta connect them.\n\n205\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the input device was\n\n206\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.230\nreally easy and\nyou reminding about all that cool stuff,\n\n207\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.550\nbut we need to tie it all together\nwith this dot color with that input.\n\n208\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.500\nNow it must be, is that something to do\nwith the ID that you put on the swatch?\n\n209\n00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna use that ID and\nreally just to clarify,\n\n210\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.680\nI would probably bundle all of this\nup into a div that has an app and\n\n211\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.280\nthen say, within these it has to\nhave this particular structure, or,\n\n212\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.680\nif I was getting real crazy, I would just\nhave a div with an app that's empty.\n\n213\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.750\nAnd then I would dynamically create all\nof these elements in JavaScript and\n\n214\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.660\nupload them to the DOM.\n\n215\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.490\nBut we're not gonna do that cuz\nthis is just a fun project, right?\n\n216\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:12:02.442\nBut what that does mean is I need\nthis.swatch = document.querySelector.\n\n217\n00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:05.980\nAnd swatch.\n\n218\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.200\nNotice that hard coded value.\n\n219\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.680\nYou should be gritting your teeth,\nkind of, I don't know what I just did.\n\n220\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.580\nWe'll leave it for now.\n\n221\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.695\nWe're gonna go with it.\n\n222\n00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:15.910\nAll right?\nSo, this.swatch.\n\n223\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.450\nNow there should be an event\ntied to the swatch, right?\n\n224\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.760\nBecause a swatch is an input type and\nput it in as an input event.\n\n225\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.410\nWell, let's add something to the swatch.\n\n226\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.980\nAdd event listener right here and\nsay, on input.\n\n227\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.466\nAnd, there we go.\n\n228\n00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:41.938\nAnd let's just console.log(e).\n\n229\n00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:42.900\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.930\nSo I have my Chrome dev tools open.\n\n231\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.980\nNothing's happening, I click here.\n\n232\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.120\nNotice there's no event that comes out,\nand I look and notice as soon as I click\n\n233\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.540\nand I release this actually works a little\nbit differently in a couple of platforms.\n\n234\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.570\nWhen I tried this on\na Linux machine of mine\n\n235\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.758\nuntil I release the event was not fired.\n\n236\n00:13:05.758 --> 00:13:11.100\nEven here,\nlike see how that input event is\n\n237\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.740\njust spamming on the right\nevery time I move this?\n\n238\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.390\nI got a little bit different behavior,\n\n239\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.860\nit was more of a the input doesn't\nfire until you've made a selection.\n\n240\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.510\nSo it's not necessarily\nscrolling left to right.\n\n241\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.240\nIt's, you let go.\n\n242\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.060\nAnd so input events do have\nsome specificity to it.\n\n243\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nLike if you're on that spectrum and\n\n244\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.870\nyou're clicking, holding to find that\nperfect shade of pink that you want.\n\n245\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.340\nIt's gonna, when you let go,\nthat's all of this is registering.\n\n246\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.450\nAnd this is a Mac specific, how's it\ntreating the event listener thing.\n\n247\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n248\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.810\nAnd that has been my experience.\n\n249\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.410\nI'm using an event here where I'm not\nentirely sure we could listen to a change\n\n250\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.210\nevent to see if hey,\nhas something changed?\n\n251\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.892\nSo definitely try a few things out and see\nif you can get more of a consistent field.\n\n252\n00:13:58.892 --> 00:14:03.645\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't matter,\nis this taxing the code or\n\n253\n00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:08.505\nkind off extraneous stuff that's making\nit process more and going to make it bad.\n\n254\n00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:10.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really while I'm picking colors this is\n\n255\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.440\njust about the only thing\ngoing on on the screen.\n\n256\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.360\nRight?\nI'm not also drawing, I'm not rendering,\n\n257\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.080\nnothing else is going on.\n\n258\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.490\nSo that's the only thing.\n\n259\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.650\nAnd the engine, the V8 and\n\n260\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.670\nChrome specifically, it's managing\nWindows events are processed.\n\n261\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.810\nSo we should be fine.\n\n262\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.910\nI would be hard pressed\nto do enough here for\n\n263\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.330\na modern computer to be like,\nI can't handle that.\n\n264\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.980\nSo, I'm not too worried about it.\n\n265\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.570\nI'm gonna come over here and line it up.\n\n266\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.000\nLet's go down and\nthat's a kinda bright pink.\n\n267\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.630\nAnd then if we click out that\nshould be our last event, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.800\nSo if I come and\nI look at the source element,\n\n269\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.470\nnotice this is the event, but I look at\nthe source, or we could use the target.\n\n270\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.680\nTypically, I use the target because\nit's standard convention that I've\n\n271\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.460\nused to create deal.\n\n272\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.620\nThose can differ depending\non some set ups.\n\n273\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.170\nIn this case, they're not going to differ.\n\n274\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:09.561\nWe scroll down and\nwe keep scrolling, value,\n\n275\n00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:15.241\nand I get a hex code,\n#ef4cd2, right there.\n\n276\n00:15:15.241 --> 00:15:16.280\nOkay?\n\n277\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.210\nThat value is a string\nrepresentation of that color.\n\n278\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.390\nWell, if I can grab that from the event\nI could probably update my application\n\n279\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.540\nto have that as the color, right?\n\n280\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.300\nOkay, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.080\nSo let's do this and say,\n\n282\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.410\nwell I want to say\nthis.color = e.target.value.\n\n283\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.980\nBelieve it or not that's all\nwe need to capture, I think.\n\n284\n00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.460\nThere are may be some nuance things here.\n\n285\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.115\nSo if we come back it's\nno longer gonna go crazy.\n\n286\n00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:54.797\nIf we look at app.color, it's black.\n\n287\n00:15:54.797 --> 00:15:55.977\nOkay?\n\n288\n00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:59.920\nAnd then if I come over here and\nI look and let's make that a green.\n\n289\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.208\nAnd go and re-run this.\n\n290\n00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:07.560\nIt's #52DF5D, which should be that green.\n\n291\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.864\nAnd if it's not, then my browser's\ngot something going on with it.\n\n292\n00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:15.088\nNow that we have that color, we should be.\n\n293\n00:16:16.247 --> 00:16:19.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you notice,\n\n294\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.000\nI said something a little while ago that\nthis might not be in the right place for\n\n295\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.090\nus to add color, right?\n\n296\n00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.530\nWe're creating a new path on mouse up.\n\n297\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.010\nWell, mouse up is going to be\nafter drawing at least one time.\n\n298\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.720\nSo if I refresh, and I select a color, and\n\n299\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.030\nI come over here,\nI haven't drawn anything.\n\n300\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:49.400\nThe path that happened on construction,\nright, well, it's black.\n\n301\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.540\nBecause that's the default color.\n\n302\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.590\nSo if I, there's black and now I mouse up.\n\n303\n00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.320\nIt creates a new path and\nstores that internal to the application.\n\n304\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.700\nNow the new color should be set.\n\n305\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.080\nAnd it, in fact, is.\n\n306\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.850\nSo, all right, we added a feature and\n\n307\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.760\nit kinda broke some other stuff,\nsome of our logic.\n\n308\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.490\nSo we're probably gonna\nhave to revisit that.\n\n309\n00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.649\n&gt;&gt; But you also kinda foreshadowed that\na little bit about this isn't gonna\n\n310\n00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:17.568\nnecessarily be the right place.\n\n311\n00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:20.158\n&gt;&gt; So there's that whole tucking\nit back into the group or\n\n312\n00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:21.579\nwhere we need this to happen?\n\n313\n00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're right,\nI did foreshadow, and\n\n314\n00:17:23.637 --> 00:17:24.813\npart of that is experience.\n\n315\n00:17:24.813 --> 00:17:27.186\nPart of that is I built\nthings like that before.\n\n316\n00:17:27.186 --> 00:17:29.060\nYou'll start to see, well,\nif I wanna add this,\n\n317\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.945\nthat actually isn't gonna\nwork in this context.\n\n318\n00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:36.500\nBut I wouldn't try to think of what\nam I gonna need in the future.\n\n319\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.680\nI think it's called yagme.\n\n320\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.606\nYou ain't gonna need it, so don't build\nthings you ain't gonna need in order\n\n321\n00:17:42.606 --> 00:17:46.790\nto satisfy some future possibly\nnon-existent condition.\n\n322\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.180\nSo if we come over here and\nwe start thinking, all right.\n\n323\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.230\nSo here's what I'm thinking.\n\n324\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.980\nI don't think path is\nnecessary right here.\n\n325\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.800\nWe may keep it.\n\n326\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.054\nLet's just keep it so\nwe don't break other things.\n\n327\n00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:09.444\nBut really what I'm thinking, is the path\nshould be created on mouse down.\n\n328\n00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:11.950\nSo we should just set a new\npath every time we click.\n\n329\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.265\nSay grab the color, go ahead and\ncreate a path, and now start tracking.\n\n330\n00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:19.790\nBecause if you think of the path\nlife cycle., mouse down, mouse move,\n\n331\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.980\nmouse up, that defines the beginning,\nend and in between.\n\n332\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.180\nWe're creating a new path at the end.\n\n333\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.310\nAnd so we get some weird color mismatch.\n\n334\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:35.492\nAnd so what we're gonna do, is we're just\ngonna grab this and put it right there.\n\n335\n00:18:35.492 --> 00:18:43.018\nAnd you know what, that simple little\nmove may actually fix everything.\n\n336\n00:18:43.018 --> 00:18:45.810\nHere's hoping, cross your fingers.\n\n337\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.660\nWe should see.\n\n338\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.230\nSo Vonne, I'm gonna go pink,\nall right, so here's pink.\n\n339\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.662\nI'm gonna close out.\n\n340\n00:18:53.662 --> 00:18:55.965\nOoh, first try.\n\n341\n00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:57.450\nWhat was the other one, purple?\n\n342\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.440\nSo we do a blue shifted a little bit.\n\n343\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.240\nAnd now we got pink and purple on the same\ncanvas, but we've added the ability for\n\n344\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.795\na user to select their own color, and\ndraw as many colors as they want.\n\n345\n00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:16.610\nAnd just to reconfirm, this is platform\nspecific how this color picker works.\n\n346\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.580\nBut this is a new advent of HTML5\nthat works wonderfully in tandem with\n\n347\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.340\nthe Canvas element, cuz you used\nto have to build a color picker.\n\n348\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.040\nLike build little div boxes and\nassign colors to them,\n\n349\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.270\nor have the ability of someone\ntype in RGB, but no, no.\n\n350\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.360\nIt is built in by default now.\n\n351\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.170\nAnd again,\nthis is newer browser technology.\n\n352\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.770\nBut I got all kinds of colors, and\n\n353\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.920\nI set this up like it was\ngonna be super difficult.\n\n354\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.830\nBut since we had it organized,\nwe knew where the individual pieces.\n\n355\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.250\nAnd I thought about this and I try to be\ntransparent about my thought process,\n\n356\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.180\nof what do I need to\nchange in the application?\n\n357\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.800\nAnd really, where does the color\ndefining how it's drawn?\n\n358\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.465\nWell, the color needs to be stored,\nwhat I've selected in the application.\n\n359\n00:20:02.465 --> 00:20:07.731\nBut what defines how it's drawn\nis the color of the path.\n\n360\n00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:10.970\nAnd that's the only way that we\ncan keep them separate, right?\n\n361\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.540\nI pulled the color into that grouping,\nthat path, cuz we would've run into\n\n362\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.960\na similar issue of the points\nin a previous episode where,\n\n363\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.490\nwhen I selected color,\nthat's what all the paths are.\n\n364\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:29.460\nBut if you wanted to apply colors,\nthen this may not be your best solution.\n\n365\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.180\nYou may want to actually select\na color in the application and\n\n366\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.390\nalways render that out, and then all\nyour paths would become whatever color.\n\n367\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.128\nBut you only get one at that point.\n\n368\n00:20:39.128 --> 00:20:40.243\nThis, you get multiple ones.\n\n369\n00:20:40.243 --> 00:20:44.787\nAnd Vonne, even though we kind of\nthought it was going to be difficult,\n\n370\n00:20:44.787 --> 00:20:46.925\nthat is adding color structure.\n\n371\n00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:47.997\nIt was that easy.\n\n372\n00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.397\n&gt;&gt; That was pretty easy.\n\n373\n00:20:49.397 --> 00:20:54.118\nLike you said,\nthat HTML 5 element of the new\n\n374\n00:20:54.118 --> 00:20:58.478\nattribute for the input, that's huge.\n\n375\n00:20:58.478 --> 00:21:02.110\nAnd, you totally put it into context for\nme.\n\n376\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.510\nLike I said, I started and\nI was like I don't know.\n\n377\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.280\nBut that yeah, to think you had to\nbuild your whole color picker before.\n\n378\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.360\nIt was like ooh, yeah.\n\n379\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.950\n&gt;&gt; It was rough going in.\n\n380\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.320\nWell, since we have a little bit of time,\nlet's do a little bit of cleaning up.\n\n381\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.164\nRight now,\nwe've been working on a single file.\n\n382\n00:21:19.164 --> 00:21:21.110\nLet's just hop down,\ndo a little bit of clean up.\n\n383\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:26.430\nThat way we have a very focused file on\nwhat we're doing inside of dev-paint,\n\n384\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.420\nin this case.\n\n385\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.110\nAnd then point and\npath will be more less separate modules,\n\n386\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.600\neven though they're global accessible.\n\n387\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:41.840\nSo let's open this up and I am gonna\ncreate another file called Weldpath.js.\n\n388\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.746\nIf you're on Node.js, if you're using it,\nbe very careful about naming this, because\n\n389\n00:21:46.746 --> 00:21:50.760\nthis is also a name for an internal\nmodule, so you may get some weirdness.\n\n390\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.560\nBut this is a browser only so\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n391\n00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.870\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm\nessentially gonna break all of this.\n\n392\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.320\nSo cut and paste.\n\n393\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.820\nThere it is.\n\n394\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:09.590\nAnd it's now broke, but\nif I come back, if I come back and\n\n395\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.890\nI duplicate, so Cmd+Shift+D,\nor Ctrl+Shift+D,\n\n396\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.320\nif you're on Linux or\nWindows, and as you see path.\n\n397\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.670\nNotice I'm changing the first one.\n\n398\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.065\nNow the second one.\n\n399\n00:22:22.065 --> 00:22:23.790\nGotta make sure that I\nhave path available for,\n\n400\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.690\nwhen I using dev-paint as the main method.\n\n401\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.520\nIf I come back,\nthat should fix everything, and it does.\n\n402\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.810\nBy default, it's black.\n\n403\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.052\nAnd now we need some blue, and\neverything's still working, no errors.\n\n404\n00:22:37.052 --> 00:22:39.250\nCool, there's our first\nlittle bit of clean up, and\n\n405\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.850\nnow let's get rid of that point object.\n\n406\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.580\nThis class is pretty small but\nyou never know,\n\n407\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.660\nit might get bigger later on as we add\nfeatures, or maybe as you add features.\n\n408\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:54.510\nSo I'm gonna cut that, I'm gonna create\nanother file called point.js and\n\n409\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.680\npaste, there it is.\n\n410\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.200\nStill broke now,\nwe have to come back to index.html.\n\n411\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.950\nAnd this is where it gets a little weird\nin the browser, when you're importing or\n\n412\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.370\nessentially defining\nthese global attributes.\n\n413\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:14.130\nSo dev-paint requires path, but\nif we come into path, look at this.\n\n414\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.910\nPath actually needs to know about point.\n\n415\n00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.280\nBut it only needs to know it\nfrom add point from event.\n\n416\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.109\nSo I could get away with it with order,\nbut just to be safe,\n\n417\n00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:26.916\npoint depends on nothing.\n\n418\n00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:32.010\nI wanna bring in point first,\nthen path, then dev-paint.\n\n419\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.990\nJust to really hedge my bets.\n\n420\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.560\n&gt;&gt; I was, in my brain I was thinking,\nyou gotta put that first.\n\n421\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.405\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nI'm waiting for-\n\n422\n00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:39.449\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n423\n00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:40.089\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n424\n00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:43.541\nI would say it's probably good to\nalways think about those dependencies,\n\n425\n00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:46.004\nespecially if you are doing\nit in a browser like this,\n\n426\n00:23:46.004 --> 00:23:49.656\nbecause if you find out that two files\nrequire each other, you can't do this.\n\n427\n00:23:49.656 --> 00:23:51.690\nAnd actually, you should kinda rethink.\n\n428\n00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.360\nWell, why do I need.\n\n429\n00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.860\nHold on a second.\n\n430\n00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.650\nIf you're using more advanced module\nbuild systems or something like that,\n\n431\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.610\nwhich if you have no idea what I'm\ntalking about, don't worry about it.\n\n432\n00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.636\nWe're just having a little\nfun in the browser,\n\n433\n00:24:01.636 --> 00:24:03.400\nthen it'll help resolve those for you.\n\n434\n00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.640\nBut if we come back,\nlet's make sure it still works.\n\n435\n00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.870\nSo I can draw in the default color.\n\n436\n00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.420\nI can now pick another color,\n\n437\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.230\nactually let's come over here and\njust bring down the red.\n\n438\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.250\nIt's kind of weird that it\nshifts the respective colors.\n\n439\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.960\nAnd then here we go.\n\n440\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.070\nActually, let's bring in some green.\n\n441\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.570\nHere we go.\n\n442\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.310\nAnd would you say that's sea foam,\nor something of that nature?\n\n443\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.550\n&gt;&gt; I'll go sea foam.\n\n444\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthat is a little bit of clean up.\n\n445\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.920\nOur color selections are done, and\nit's way easier because, well,\n\n446\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.710\nwe've employed kind of this refactoring\nthought process at every step of the way.\n\n447\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:47.040\nSo that is incredibly helpful\nas you continue to add features.\n\n448\n00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.668\n&gt;&gt; Well, another amazing episode.\n\n449\n00:24:48.668 --> 00:24:53.025\n[LAUGH] That made me very happy to see\ncolor and paths, and the picker, and\n\n450\n00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:56.820\nyou really pulled it all together for\nme, so thank you so much.\n\n451\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.347\nI hope that worked for\nyou

DEVPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:18.505\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:21.875\nwe are bringing back more on\nour HTML5 Canvas Projects.\n\n5\n00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:26.575\nAnd we're also continuing on with our\ndrawing thing that we're making, yes,\n\n6\n00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:27.615\nit's a thing, and\n\n7\n00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.935\nwe're also going to be changing\nthe size of a line in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:34.980\nSo here to help us talk about this thing,\n[LAUGH] is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n9\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.152\nHello, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:38.730\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic,\nexcept I'm in panic mode now.\n\n11\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.890\nI've got to go change documentation\nbecause I haven't been calling it a thing,\n\n12\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.805\nI've been calling it a whatchamacallit.\n\n13\n00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have some issues.\n\n14\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.300\nBut how are you, Yvonne?\n\n15\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n16\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.187\nI really like these episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:50.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm having so\n\n18\n00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:51.888\nmuch fun over here at DEVPRO.TV.\n\n19\n00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:56.533\nI'm so glad that you've invited me here\nand hopefully, you'll keep inviting me\n\n20\n00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.982\nback, so I can watch all the fun\nstuff with colors and lines.\n\n21\n00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:03.895\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] But, actually that brings up\na good point, a lot of times people think,\n\n22\n00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.811\nprogramming math, it's a, right.\n\n23\n00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.256\nBut there are some amounts of creative\nkind of expression that we can do and,\n\n24\n00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:13.530\nthis series actually\ndemonstrates that a little more.\n\n25\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.500\nThere is some math, don't get me wrong.\n\n26\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.740\nBut relative proportions, drawing,\nperspective all of those artistic things\n\n27\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.890\ncan be represented as\nmathematical relationships.\n\n28\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.510\n&gt;&gt; And I feel like this is just\nlike everybody started off\n\n29\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.130\nwith Paint somewhere along the way or\nsome very simple, simple program,\n\n30\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.848\neither on a website or a computer\nprogram that you've grown up with.\n\n31\n00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:38.345\n[SOUND] So it's, it just brings back\nsomething that I think anybody that's used\n\n32\n00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.235\na computer can kinda relate too.\n\n33\n00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would have to agree.\n\n34\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.430\nAnd, well, that made me think,\nwhat are the things that I did, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.670\nWe, in the last few episodes\nwe've actually been able to draw.\n\n36\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.440\nWe have the ability to draw multiple\nlines that are not all connected into\n\n37\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.730\none continuous spaghetti noodle, and then\nwe added some color in the last episode.\n\n38\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.810\nif you havent seen that\ndefinitely go check that out.\n\n39\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.320\nI was like, the nostalgia it's\nwelling up inside of me but\n\n40\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.290\nthere's something missing.\n\n41\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.900\nAll these lines are tiny.\n\n42\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.155\nWhat if I wanted to, I don't know if\nyou've ever, when I play with the brush\n\n43\n00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.995\ntool or whatever, I would make it more or\nless the size of the screen.\n\n44\n00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.995\nJust click once and\ngo I did it all in one fell swoop.\n\n45\n00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:20.061\n&gt;&gt; I used to do that too.\n\n46\n00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.117\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're children.\n\n47\n00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:22.829\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n48\n00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that made me start thinking,\n\n49\n00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.650\nwe don't have any way to adjust the size.\n\n50\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.830\nWe can't have a paint project without\nthe ability to adjust the size.\n\n51\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650\nSo, that's what we're\ngonna do in this episode.\n\n52\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like the drop-down or\nsomething and you'd click and\n\n53\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.290\nit would show the different circles and\nsometimes you only got two or three or\n\n54\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.330\nfour or something but\nthat you could change the diameter.\n\n55\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.480\nAnd if you had it to where you\ncould type it in infinitely,\n\n56\n00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.990\nmake the big blob, that we did [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah, so we're not gonna\ndrop down, we're actually going to\n\n58\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.420\nutilize some of these new,\nsince we're working on a canvas element.\n\n59\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.000\nI feel compelled to pull in some newer\nfeatures of HTML which well frankly make\n\n60\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.820\nmy job a lot easier but make yours a lot\neasier as well if you wanna follow along.\n\n61\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.037\nSo let's go to take a look at my screen,\nsee what the state of the app is.\n\n62\n00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:12.850\nLet's think it a little\nbit of where we are going.\n\n63\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.170\nSo the app if you look,\nI kinda had some previously drawn stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.206\nI'm just gonna pick up some red here and\nnow I'm gonna draw,\n\n65\n00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.870\nlook at that, red [INAUDIBLE] right.\n\n66\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.267\nI want it to be bigger, I'm thinking so\nif this is my color selector and\n\n67\n00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:31.067\nI'm probably come back and\nlabel this and do some clean up but\n\n68\n00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:33.691\nI would really like to have almost like a.\n\n69\n00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:41.200\nLike a slider, right, that I can just\nslide from the minimum to the maximum.\n\n70\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.570\nAnd yes, I do have to define mins and\nmaxes no way around it,\n\n71\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.966\nbut now with Vonne's suggestion\nI could put an input box and\n\n72\n00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:54.800\nhave you type in, let's do a slider.\n\n73\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.620\nThat way I can set limits,\nI can keep things from getting crazy and\n\n74\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.460\nhopefully persuade a user, hey,\nthis is how I expect you to use this.\n\n75\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.328\nSo, before we work on any JavaScript,\n\n76\n00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:12.464\nwell back way back when,\nyou had to build a slider yourself.\n\n77\n00:04:12.464 --> 00:04:17.220\nTo build the JavaScript and\nit's this percentage across the width, and\n\n78\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.860\ncalculate what is the minimum amount,\nit was a whole bunch of shenanigans.\n\n79\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.347\n&gt;&gt; I am actually remembering this from\nFlash and having to build a volume.\n\n80\n00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:29.633\nYes, that was, [SOUND].\n\n81\n00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes me grit my\nteeth just thinking about it.\n\n82\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.550\nYou're like you taste that, that's bad.\n\n83\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.530\nBut HTML provides us with some niceties.\n\n84\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.533\n&gt;&gt; It's another input type, right?\n\n85\n00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:44.957\nThe new,\nwe have the color from the last episode,\n\n86\n00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:49.460\nnot necessarily if you're watching, well,\nthis is kind of a sequence, obviously.\n\n87\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.032\nSo that was the color, now we're doing,\nI can't remember the actual.\n\n88\n00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:54.720\nWas it just slider?\n\n89\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720\nI don't think it was.\n\n90\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.510\n&gt;&gt; So I tended to do that as well.\n\n91\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.110\nI'm like, it's a slider,\nwell kinda, it's almost a slider.\n\n92\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.470\nIt's almost a slider and\nreally it is an input type, and\n\n93\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.160\nI'm just hitting tab there and\nit auto completes for me.\n\n94\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.260\nSo if we do this depending on\nwhether I hit tab, because I have\n\n95\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.450\nsome other thing or if I hit enter it'll\nautocomplete, so I'll just take these out.\n\n96\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.400\nLets not muddy the waters here,\nI don't want to text.\n\n97\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.850\nIf you type a slider though, if you come\nover here in slider, it actually gives\n\n98\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.940\nyou a text because slider isn't valid but\nthat's ultimately what we're building.\n\n99\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.470\nWhat it's called though is a range type.\n\n100\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.370\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n101\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.510\n&gt;&gt; So I get a range.\n\n102\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.520\nNow how this looks is platform\nspecific because it ends up being,\n\n103\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.720\nusing the UI toolkit that's specific\nto Mac or Windows or Linux, right.\n\n104\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.960\nYou have Qt and all these and\nthen Coco for Mac.\n\n105\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.540\nSo this is nice, kind of rounded edges.\n\n106\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.060\nBorder radius everywhere, except for this.\n\n107\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.230\nOkay, so as I slide this,\nmy slider's done.\n\n108\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.430\nGuess what?\n\n109\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.420\nThat's all I have to do.\n\n110\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.760\nNow there are a few things I want\nto add in here, like an ID, right.\n\n111\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.660\nWhat does this range object describe?\n\n112\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.100\nSize.\nI can also set its minimum.\n\n113\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.400\nI don't want you to go below 1,\nbecause that doesn't make any sense and\n\n114\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.390\nI'm talking pixels.\n\n115\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.940\nNow you get to define your units.\n\n116\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.170\nYou can handle these a variety of ways,\nbut we're gonna go with 1, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.350\nAnd then max, maybe 20 pixels and\n\n118\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.230\nyou can define the step,\nso min, max, step.\n\n119\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.666\nStart, stop step, that's what I think of,\nthe three s, start, stop, step.\n\n120\n00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:49.321\nWhere do I begin, where do I end and\nhow do I get from one to the other?\n\n121\n00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:52.655\nIf you don't put that step in there,\nyou can actually get fractional values and\n\n122\n00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:55.470\nI don't know if that makes a whole lot of,\nI have 1.33 pixels.\n\n123\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.080\nWe should probably just make that 2,\nor a 1 depending on this logic.\n\n124\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.970\nSo if we come back, and\nwe refresh, well guess what?\n\n125\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.420\nIt doesn't look any different but\n\n126\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.070\nnow we've defined over here is 1,\nover here is 20 and it will snap.\n\n127\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.150\nSee how it kind of, let me zoom in here,\nsee how it kinda snaps?\n\n128\n00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.720\nThat's defined by the step attribute.\n\n129\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.740\nThat's for free in HTML.\n\n130\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.460\nAll right so we've talked a little bit\nabout we haven't even got to drawing yet.\n\n131\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:32.642\nWe came over here and\nwell, just like the swatch,\n\n132\n00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:37.601\nI'm gonna say this dot size equals\n\n133\n00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.893\ndocument.querySelector.\n\n134\n00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:44.063\nThere we go.\n\n135\n00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.710\nSize, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.448\nSo there's our size element.\n\n137\n00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:54.260\nAnd well, what is there a slide of event?\n\n138\n00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.170\nThis is going to follow very similar\nif you've seen the color episode.\n\n139\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.660\nI have the input element.\n\n140\n00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.400\nI now need to listen for\nwhen it does something.\n\n141\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.650\nAn event from it and track that and\n\n142\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.040\nuse that to make decisions or\nat least set states.\n\n143\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.503\nSo this.size.addEventListener and\n\n144\n00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:15.163\nlet's try input because that\nworked with color, right.\n\n145\n00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:20.145\nSo let's say console.log,\n\n146\n00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:24.330\nthe event and refresh and\n\n147\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.325\nguess what, it works.\n\n148\n00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:31.205\nNow if we come and look at this and\n\n149\n00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:35.600\nwe look at the target element and\nwe scroll down.\n\n150\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.300\nGuess what?\n\n151\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.150\nWe scroll down here, for value 2.\n\n152\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.540\nValue of 2.\n\n153\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.620\nWell, what if I now drag\nit all the way over here,\n\n154\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.450\nwe get a bunch more events and\nlet's look at the target element again.\n\n155\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.660\nScroll all the way down here and\nthe value is 20.\n\n156\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.540\nAlso notice there's a value as number.\n\n157\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.990\nThat may be more applicable to\nwhat we need instead of having\n\n158\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.290\nto handle the number stuff originally.\n\n159\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.960\nDo be careful if this is not a slider but\na type in value and you're using a value\n\n160\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.840\nas a number you may get NaNs, cuz not\neverything can be created as a number.\n\n161\n00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.240\nOr you may get null like this valueAsDate.\n\n162\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.090\nWell 20 isn't a date you need a month,\nday, year at minimum.\n\n163\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.900\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n164\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.870\nBut we'll probably make use of this.\n\n165\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.930\nBut I did mention.\n\n166\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.870\nI wonder if its a change event because I\nam changing something about the slider.\n\n167\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.500\nI'm changing the relative position\nof the slider let's see if we get\n\n168\n00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.890\nevents from that.\n\n169\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.850\nSo nothing and when I release now.\n\n170\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.990\nSo notice the difference between input and\nchange.\n\n171\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.160\nAnd this could have worked very similarly,\nif I'm not mistaken, for the color.\n\n172\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.550\nThen I wanted to use an input event.\n\n173\n00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.210\nSo I'm always kind of tracking that,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n174\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.050\nBut if I move this slider and I release,\n\n175\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.730\nas soon as I commit to that value the\nevent says hey, the value has changed now.\n\n176\n00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.490\nIt's not an input, it's a change event.\n\n177\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.130\nSo I think for the slider that makes\na little more sense, I don't want, right.\n\n178\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.250\nAnd In all actually, I'm going to\nbe completely transparent here,\n\n179\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.650\nI could probably do that for\nthe color as well.\n\n180\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.170\nBut, it's a nice compare and\n\n181\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.821\ncontrast within our project because\nthis is kind of a playful project.\n\n182\n00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:27.900\nSo, I'm going to leave that as a change\nevent, but I still get the target and\n\n183\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.180\nI still get the value as number for\n2 and I can move up and down.\n\n184\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.710\nAnd if I come all the way over to\nthe left, I wanna make sure that I get 1,\n\n185\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.550\nand nothing less than that.\n\n186\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.820\nAnd, boom,\nscroll down the value as number 1.\n\n187\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.730\nAnd if I go all the way to the right,\nmy maximum is 20, so\n\n188\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.320\nthat is an inclusive range.\n\n189\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:54.040\nIt's a range of numbers and that's why\nit's called an input of type range.\n\n190\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.705\nSo now that we have\nthose interactions down,\n\n191\n00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:02.895\nhere's something that I'm thinking.\n\n192\n00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:07.225\nWell, if we compare this to the color,\n\n193\n00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:12.890\nwe were setting this dot\ncolor to the target value.\n\n194\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.705\nOkay, okay, but we said size here.\n\n195\n00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:20.513\nSo probably not this dot size because that\nwould actually, over the first event,\n\n196\n00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.970\nit would override and\nthen all your stuff breaks.\n\n197\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:31.211\nSo I'm thinking that we go with\nsomething like this.strokeSize or\n\n198\n00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:35.840\nmaybe linesize,\nI'm gonna go with strokeSize.\n\n199\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.630\nAnd what is that by default?\n\n200\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.400\nWhat does it start on with the value.\n\n201\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.430\nI don't know?\n\n202\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.328\nWell, if we come over here,\njust a quick little aside,\n\n203\n00:11:49.328 --> 00:11:54.195\nWe'll say value=2,\nthat is now its default value.\n\n204\n00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:56.230\nJust, I'm scaffolding this up so\n\n205\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.110\nI can keep those consistent\nuntil the first event fires.\n\n206\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.580\nIf I was doing this programmatically,\n\n207\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.320\nI would just set that and\nit would be set regardless.\n\n208\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.470\nSo I'm gonna stay with 2 because\nthat's what I set it in the HTML.\n\n209\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.135\nAnd, well, what that means is,\nis I'm gonna say\n\n210\n00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:20.710\nthis.strokeSize=e.target.valueAsNumber;\njust like that.\n\n211\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.660\nOkay, valueAsNumber.\n\n212\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.590\nAnd now, let's go refresh.\n\n213\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.298\nMove that over.\n\n214\n00:12:27.298 --> 00:12:31.380\nI'll say app.strokeSize, that's a 10.\n\n215\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.970\nLet's move all the way over here,\ndo it again, that's 20, so it is updating.\n\n216\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:42.005\nIf we draw though, it's still tiny,\nwell, that's because\n\n217\n00:12:42.005 --> 00:12:46.720\nif we look back through color, notice the\npath, we said hey this path is this color.\n\n218\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.810\nA very similar line of reasoning\nsays this path has this stroke size.\n\n219\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.390\nSo, as it stands,\nthat grouping needs to know,\n\n220\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.138\nwhat is the currently selected size and\ncolor?\n\n221\n00:13:01.138 --> 00:13:06.720\nThe only thing we're telling it at\ncurrent, is what color it should be,\n\n222\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.930\nnot what size it should be and\npart of that is well, the path.\n\n223\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.740\nIt doesn't know how to handle size.\n\n224\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.430\nRight, so,\nthis allows you to pass in color.\n\n225\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:24.430\nSo I come here and I say, size or\nlet's be a little more explicit.\n\n226\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.480\nLet's say stroke size, just like that.\n\n227\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.580\nThen I'm not gonna say this side stroke\nsize, Side= strokeSize, just like that.\n\n228\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.796\nThis wouldn't change anything if we\ndon't go and change the rendering, okay.\n\n229\n00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:48.190\nStrokeStyle, and then\ncontext.lineWidth=thisstyle.strokesize.\n\n230\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.810\nNow I didn't pick then that's not\nsomething that's how it's defined in\n\n231\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:58.310\nthe 2D graphical context line width\nessentially defines how big the line is.\n\n232\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.290\nSo, if it was left up to me I would\nprobably say stroke size because stroke\n\n233\n00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.470\nstyle is how.\n\n234\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.740\nYou know, what color is it?\n\n235\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.430\nSo, I would of just kept this consistent.\n\n236\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.598\nBut, I didn't make the API for this, so\n\n237\n00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.860\nwe're gonna have to follow\nthe one that's provided to us.\n\n238\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.190\nSo, the last thing we need\nto come over here and\n\n239\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.090\nlook at is we need to pass that in.\n\n240\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.130\nstrokeSize, should\n\n241\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.314\nbe good to go except right here we\nprobably need to this.strokeSize.\n\n242\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.074\nAnd you'll noticed after\nthe first implementation of color,\n\n243\n00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:38.030\nsize kind of just fell out,\nit was essentially the very same pattern.\n\n244\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.270\nLet me create a UI element to allow\ninteractions, let me modify the path so\n\n245\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.090\nit knows what rendering information\nit needs, color and size.\n\n246\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.760\nAnd then let store whatever\nhas been selected and\n\n247\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.360\npass that to the next path, right.\n\n248\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.060\nSo by default this is what it is.\n\n249\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.480\nThe first path is black of size\n2 until I hit mouse down and\n\n250\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.800\nthen I created a new path and\nif I ever changed the size well,\n\n251\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.865\nthe stroke size is going to be\nupdated as such, all right.\n\n252\n00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:11.444\nSo if we come over here and we refresh and\n\n253\n00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:15.884\nall right, and then if we move this up.\n\n254\n00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:20.840\nAh-ha, now it's not super smooth\n\n255\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.710\nright, but it does give us some width.\n\n256\n00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.210\nAnd part of that is I'm\ndrawing with a track pad, so\n\n257\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.970\nI'm doing like weird wiggles.\n\n258\n00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.550\nLet's come over here, change this to red.\n\n259\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.580\nThat looks nice.\n\n260\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.580\nI'm also wicked zoomed in, so I have\nsome pixilation, so it has to tabulate.\n\n261\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.370\nAnd now I have the ability to\nchange the size of the lines.\n\n262\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.810\nBut I wanted to do this,\n\n263\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.240\nnumber one, because I want\nthe ability to change the size.\n\n264\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.680\nBut also to demonstrate these\npatterns keep popping up.\n\n265\n00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.000\nAlright, I need a UI element, I need\nthe ability to store the information,\n\n266\n00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000\nas well as select the information and\nthen it kind of just falls out.\n\n267\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.330\nIs this the most performing?\n\n268\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.870\nProbably not.\n\n269\n00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:12.710\nIs the absolute best\nimplementation probably not but\n\n270\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:18.450\nthis is all about nostalgia like getting\nthings to work and we should be able to\n\n271\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:23.600\nnow select a different size, select a\ndifferent color, still maintain the size.\n\n272\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.960\nI didn't select the color.\n\n273\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.230\nThere we go.\n\n274\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.270\nThere we go.\n\n275\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.080\nSo now we have that and\nif I zoom out to 100% you'll\n\n276\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.545\nnotice that it's a little smoother looking\nand there are ways to smooth that out.\n\n277\n00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I mean you're also\ndoing this to teach the concepts of\n\n278\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.810\nthis whole HTML5 Canvas Projects and\njust using the canvas and\n\n279\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.160\nthe HTML5 elements outside of it.\n\n280\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.660\nSo, I think it's great.\n\n281\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it seems like it should\nbe complicated, just like color, but\n\n282\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.370\nit was just that easy.\n\n283\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.100\nOnce we get things in place,\nfeatures just start falling out.\n\n284\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.110\n&gt;&gt; But like you said in the other episode,\nor maybe even this episode,\n\n285\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.190\nit's because you set up\nthe logic the right way, and\n\n286\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.008\nyou really thought it through and\ngrouped it all.\n\n287\n00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:16.379\nCuz, I mean I know enough that you can\ncode it a whole bunch of different ways\n\n288\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.585\nIt's not necessarily wrong,\nbut it ain't really right.\n\n289\n00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:23.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are ways of organizing\n\n290\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.920\nthis code that could definitely make\nthis a lot more difficult to implement.\n\n291\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.030\nBy some of the rearrangement that\nwe did in previous episodes,\n\n292\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.400\nit made it a little easier to follow in\nmy mind and it helps me reason about it.\n\n293\n00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.600\nWe could've kept it very first\ntime we goy anything on the page.\n\n294\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.860\nWe had a bunch of global variables and\nthing, we could ofkept it like that and\n\n295\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.490\nI could've implemented it just as I had.\n\n296\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.940\nBut now I'm like all right,\n\n297\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.890\nnow I gotta go over here and\nhow's it, I gotta bunch of points.\n\n298\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.653\nIt could be done it's just not going\nnecessarily going to be easy but\n\n299\n00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:55.230\ndefinitely try it out.\n\n300\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.970\nSee what works for\n\n301\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:00.830\nyou because this may not be one of your\nthought processes like it is mine.\n\n302\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.753\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'm following your thought process.\n\n303\n00:18:02.753 --> 00:18:03.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n304\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.635\nthat's the only thing that matters, right?\n\n305\n00:18:05.635 --> 00:18:08.380\n[LAUGH] Well hope your following along and\nit's making sense and\n\n306\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.300\nit's kind of clicking in your\nbrain as well because that's,\n\n307\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.730\nthat's the whole reason\nwhy we're here isn't it.\n\n308\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is sure is.\n\n309\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.860\nIt is to provide you with the ability\nto well level up your game,\n\n310\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.470\nturn up the wick on your\nknowledge sort of speak.\n\n311\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah turn that slider all the way up.\n\n312\n00:18:23.122 --> 00:18:24.317\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like we did,\n\n313\n00:18:24.317 --> 00:18:26.750\nyou just have to make sure\nit's all connected so.\n\n314\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.770\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right well that was a lot of fun,\n\n315\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.900\nthank you so much for that.\n\n316\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.450\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n317\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.660\nSigning off for DEVPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, vonne Smith.\n\n318\n00:18:35.660 -->

go.\n\n3\n00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:20.947\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with HTML5 Canvass projects.\n\n4\n00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:25.470\nWe are gonna be saving the image\nwith Justin Denison right here.\n\n5\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.926\nThanks for joining us, sir [LAUGH].\n\n6\n00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.012\n&gt;&gt; It is good to be back, Zach.\n\n7\n00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:29.127\nAnd I am pretty excited.\n\n8\n00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:33.221\nWe're kind of at a starting point,\nbut before we get there,\n\n9\n00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:35.881\nlet's think about where have we been?\n\n10\n00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.410\n&gt;&gt; Where have we been?\n\n11\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800\n&gt;&gt; So we started with a very\nsimple HTML5 Canvass, right?\n\n12\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.013\nAnd this was kind of spurred\nalong by some nostalgic feelings\n\n13\n00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.667\nof those simple paint programs where\nI'm just kind of, it was more or\n\n14\n00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.770\nless like I had a crayon in my hand going,\nI like coloring.\n\n15\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.980\n&gt;&gt; You were channeling Picasso.\n\n16\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.510\n&gt;&gt; I was, I was.\n\n17\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.790\nAnd along those lines, I added\nthe ability to transition colors, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.546\nTo change the colors as well as\nthe size and to keep separate paths.\n\n19\n00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.502\nSo I could have a multitude of different\ndrawings with different colors and\n\n20\n00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:08.530\ndifferent sizes.\n\n21\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.140\nNow, I could go a great deal\nfurther with this, and who knows,\n\n22\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.930\nin the future I may come back and\nattack that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.020\nBut I think now's a good stopping point to\nwhere maybe you could take it over, right?\n\n24\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.860\nAnd then go, look what I've done.\n\n25\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.930\nNow, I think the final thing is, one of\nthe things that I did when I was a child,\n\n26\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.810\nis I would draw these.\n\n27\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.553\nAnd then I would save them.\n\n28\n00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:32.545\nI mean, look at this.\n\n29\n00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:36.630\nOr the proverbial hang it on the fridge,\nso to speak.\n\n30\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.380\nSo I think that's a good\nplace to kinda leave this for\n\n31\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.995\nyou to take over and expand.\n\n32\n00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:47.120\nAnd I would be interested to see\nwhat kinda features that you employ.\n\n33\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.684\nBut we've explained where we've been,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:54.056\ntake a look at where we left off and\nwhat's my ultimate goal?\n\n35\n00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.131\nThis isn't too horribly difficult, but\n\n36\n00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.220\nthere are a few nuanced things\nthat we have to be careful with.\n\n37\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.045\nSo if we go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen here, and here's our canvas,\n\n38\n00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:04.236\nand, I can draw.\n\n39\n00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:07.253\nAnd if I can come over here and\nchange this color, and\n\n40\n00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:09.320\nlet's change it to this blue here.\n\n41\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.200\nIt's a nice blue.\n\n42\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200\nAnd then I can draw that blue path.\n\n43\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.720\nMake that size a little bit bigger.\n\n44\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.703\nAnd there we go.\n\n45\n00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:21.444\nAnd now, at this point,\nif I was like, I'm done,\n\n46\n00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:25.329\nthis is the [FOREIGN]-\n&gt;&gt; The [FOREIGN].\n\n47\n00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.903\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; Now, there it is, there it is.\n\n48\n00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:31.610\nI had it in my head, but\nmy tongue just wouldn't make it happen.\n\n49\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.765\nSo if I wanted to save this,\nthen I'm gonna have some trouble.\n\n50\n00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:36.190\nThere's no way to save that.\n\n51\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.489\nNow, I could try to screen capture it.\n\n52\n00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.485\nI'd almost like to have a save button,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.048\nNow, I've shown this before, but\n\n54\n00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:48.070\nI was thinking when I save\nthese the name was important.\n\n55\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.710\nI would give them kind of funky names.\n\n56\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.590\nI'm not gonna build a modal,\na nicely styled modal.\n\n57\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.330\nI'm gonna more use some of the built-in,\n\n58\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.650\nsometimes annoying,\naspects of the browser, right?\n\n59\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.590\nSo you have the alerts and the prompts.\n\n60\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.810\nI'm thinking maybe we'll take\nthe prompt and say, hey,\n\n61\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.120\nwhat's the name of your file?\n\n62\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.890\nAnd you take that in, and then,\nonly then, will you then save it.\n\n63\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.690\nThat was then said a lot.\n\n64\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.180\n&gt;&gt; I think you should\ncall it mosquito goggles.\n\n65\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Mosquito goggles, possibly, possibly.\n\n66\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.806\nBut there's not a hand swatting-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:25.740\n&gt;&gt; Around like this, but you never know.\n\n68\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.920\nWe could have some fun with that.\n\n69\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.890\nBut now that we have the idea there,\nwhat do we need?\n\n70\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.260\nI'm thinking like a button\nhere that says save, and\n\n71\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.780\nwhen I click that I get a prompt, and\nthen the actual image save occurs, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.351\nI could make this real nice, but I think\nkind of quick and dirty is the best.\n\n73\n00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.232\nSo if I need that button, and\nI need the ability to click,\n\n74\n00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:51.390\nI need a little bit of HTML, little bit of\nJavaScript, and we should be good to go.\n\n75\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.560\nSo, let's go ahead and hop over here and\nlook at my index.html.\n\n76\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.117\nNow, here's my canvas,\nhere's my swatch, and here's my range.\n\n77\n00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:02.166\nAnd I think this button is\nprobably best put here.\n\n78\n00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.983\nSo I'm gonna say button.\n\n79\n00:04:03.983 --> 00:04:05.397\nAnd it is a type button.\n\n80\n00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:08.297\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of this name,\nbecause it's not in a form,\n\n81\n00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:10.470\nits just using JavaScript\nto interact with it.\n\n82\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.093\nAnd I'm gonna call this\nsave-button like that.\n\n83\n00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:15.712\nSo, save.\n\n84\n00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:19.630\nAll right,\nthat's all I need in that capacity.\n\n85\n00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.850\nLet's go make sure that I don't\nhave any issues and app save,\n\n86\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.300\nit's not the most beautiful thing.\n\n87\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.950\nI'm actually gonna zoom in just\na little bit even though our drawing\n\n88\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.080\nwill appear a little more pixellated\nto us because we're zooming.\n\n89\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.660\nBut if I click Save,\nI'm want a prompt to come up, right?\n\n90\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.905\nAnd what do I mean by prompt?\n\n91\n00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:41.190\nWell, you actually have to call it.\n\n92\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.580\nNotice this prompt comes up,\njust like this.\n\n93\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.419\nAnd this is, you can ask a question, and\n\n94\n00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.986\nwhatever you type in the box\nwill actually be returned.\n\n95\n00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:52.890\nNow, I'm not a big proponent of\nusing things like this all the time.\n\n96\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.860\nIt's just a nice little, okay,\nI see what you're doing there.\n\n97\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.560\nI could put an input field here, right?\n\n98\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.029\nI could build a more stylishly nice modal.\n\n99\n00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.724\nAnd what do I mean by modal?\n\n100\n00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:09.448\nKind of one of those hover over elements\nthat asks what do you want to name\n\n101\n00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:10.250\nyour file?\n\n102\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.640\nKind of a quick and dirty,\nlets use the prompt.\n\n103\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.220\nNow, the one thing that I do want\nto let everybody know in case\n\n104\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.510\nyou haven't realized, your prompt is kind\nof styled by whatever system you're on.\n\n105\n00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.290\nSo I'm using MacOS,\nit's kind of gonna look like this.\n\n106\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.240\nIt looks a little bit different in Windows\nenvironment, a little bit different in\n\n107\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.220\nLinux environments or,\nwell, let me rephrase that.\n\n108\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.650\nIt did the last time I used\nit in those environments.\n\n109\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.130\nThings do change.\n\n110\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.820\nSo if you're like, well, it looks\nthe same to me in my Windows and MacOS.\n\n111\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.500\nWell, luckily, they're trying to make\nthose a little more uniform in your case.\n\n112\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.300\nBut if we cancel, and let's see.\n\n113\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.970\nLet's actually type something in here.\n\n114\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.430\nAnd notice over here on the right,\nwhen we called it and\n\n115\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.390\njust cancelled, we got a null.\n\n116\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.830\nWe called it and we got a null.\n\n117\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.630\nAnd then if we called it, and\ninside these parenthesis we can actually\n\n118\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.340\nput something to ask like what do you want\nto name your file, and that will appear.\n\n119\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.040\nWhat is returned is the string.\n\n120\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:20.110\nOkay, so\nkind of a poor man's save dialogue box.\n\n121\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.840\nSo I have this ave button.\n\n122\n00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.950\nNow, what that means\nis in the constructor,\n\n123\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.984\nI need to go ahead and grab that.\n\n124\n00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:29.035\nSo let's come down where I'm\ngrabbing all these elements.\n\n125\n00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:34.731\nAnd I'm gonna call this saveButton\ndocument.querySelector and\n\n126\n00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:39.065\nsave-button, like so, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.535\nNow, this is an event.\n\n128\n00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.075\nI have that button.\n\n129\n00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:47.720\nWhen I click this saveButton,\nthat's when I want to run this, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.800\nI'm not gonna do a whole lot at this\nmoment, because I need to make sure that,\n\n131\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.520\nnumber one, I don't have any typos here.\n\n132\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.030\nThese are really prone to typos.\n\n133\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.980\nBut number two, I want to incrementally\njust grab the individual pieces, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.220\nSo I'm gonna come down here at\nthe bottom of, you know what?\n\n135\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.880\nAnd I was just seeing something.\n\n136\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.235\nThis should actually be this,\nand this should actually be this.\n\n137\n00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:18.193\nThat's some weirdness there.\n\n138\n00:07:18.193 --> 00:07:23.000\nAnd why- I got lucky on that.\n\n139\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.570\nThat's one of those things where that\nwould have kind of come back to bite me\n\n140\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.450\nlater on.\n\n141\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.780\nBut it was working in this case.\n\n142\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.894\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n143\n00:07:33.894 --> 00:07:38.669\nNow, running below this one, I'm gonna say\n\n144\n00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.208\nthis.saveButton.addEventListener for\nclick.\n\n145\n00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:46.890\nAnd I'm gonna take the Event like so.\n\n146\n00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.712\nAnd let's see here,\n\n147\n00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:58.397\nlet's say console.log here.\n\n148\n00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:02.414\nLet's just make sure that that\nclick is working as we anticipated.\n\n149\n00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:03.663\nSo I click save.\n\n150\n00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:04.846\nSave, save, save.\n\n151\n00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:06.728\nThen, here, is actually working.\n\n152\n00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:09.460\nLet's make sure that we can still draw.\n\n153\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.960\nWe can.\n\n154\n00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.670\nBecause we had to change a couple\nof those whoops-a-daisies we had.\n\n155\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.780\nLet's make sure this gets bigger.\n\n156\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.510\nAnd it does.\n\n157\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.049\nAnd let's make sure that\nthe color still changes.\n\n158\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.240\nAnd it does.\n\n159\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.200\nNow you may be asking yourself\nwhy did he check that?\n\n160\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.040\nHe just added another event listener.\n\n161\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.700\nWell, I actually just came here\nto mouse up and mouse down, or\n\n162\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.240\nmouse move and change to this dot canvas.\n\n163\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.690\nBecause, it should've\nbeen this dot canvas, and\n\n164\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.808\nactually this dot canvas right here.\n\n165\n00:08:44.808 --> 00:08:49.660\nOkay, now [COUGH] Part of\nthat is some craziness with\n\n166\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.800\nwell Canvas I'm gonna look that up and\nit should be available, it's all good.\n\n167\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.160\nBut I want to stay consistent.\n\n168\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.580\nSo we get that all squared away.\n\n169\n00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.260\nAnd then what needs to happen initially?\n\n170\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.933\nI'm thinking ask the user for\nthe file name.\n\n171\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.221\nGrab the canvas element\nlike graphic information\n\n172\n00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:21.912\nInformation and so.\n\n173\n00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:22.991\nAnd then.\n\n174\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.770\nHow does one save or\nhow about download the image?\n\n175\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.360\nNow that's very simplistic three steps.\n\n176\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.570\nThe first two are actually a lot\neasier than the last part.\n\n177\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.980\nBut, the download, so that may take\na little bit more to get to have them.\n\n178\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.370\nBut let's ask the user for a filename.\n\n179\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.420\nSo I'm gonna say filename.\n\n180\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.940\nAnd this should be window.prompt(\"What do\n\n181\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.230\nyou want to call your file?\").\n\n182\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:03.226\nWhat do you want to name the image?\n\n183\n00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:10.450\nAll right,\nnow I'm just gonna console.log and\n\n184\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.360\nmake sure that the file\nname is what I anticipate.\n\n185\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.820\nAll right, so if I refresh, click Save and\n\n186\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.240\nI'm thinking blank cuz\nright now it's blank.\n\n187\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.570\nJust to show you what I typed in there.\n\n188\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.630\nI just type the word blink and hit okay\nand notice I get a string blank back.\n\n189\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.980\nSo whatever I type in that\nlittle prompt dialogue box\n\n190\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.760\nis exactly what I'm gonna get back.\n\n191\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.010\nAll right so that works.\n\n192\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.970\nBut there is one thing that I need to do.\n\n193\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.820\nI don't think I'm gonna be\nable to have this as a const,\n\n194\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.050\ncuz I need to modify this\nbecause I needed to do a check.\n\n195\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.831\nI needed to say filename = and\n\n196\n00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:56.810\nthen does filename.endswith\n\n197\n00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:03.124\nWith .png.\n\n198\n00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:08.600\nSo I'm making a decision that\nwe are having PNG's always.\n\n199\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:19.505\nIf it does, then just stay with\nthe file name, otherwise filename\n\n200\n00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:25.540\nplus .PNG just to pin that onto it.\n\n201\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.630\nAnd now let's add that console.log\nof filename back in there.\n\n202\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.770\nSo if I come back, and I click Save.\n\n203\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.350\nAnd I say blank, blank.png, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:44.005\nBut what if I just say blank.png?\n\n205\n00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:46.639\nIt's still blank.png\nbecause that doesn't alter.\n\n206\n00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.140\nNow here's the tricky part.\n\n207\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.190\nAnd I'm gonna let you know about this.\n\n208\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.990\nI'm not gonna go crazy deep\ninto arrow handling here.\n\n209\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.093\nBut if I say blank.jpg, Then\n\n210\n00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:05.285\nthe code that I have written\nwill actually say blank.jpg.png.\n\n211\n00:12:05.285 --> 00:12:09.740\nThis jpg will not actually be\na representation of the file type.\n\n212\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.890\nIn order to do that,\nI'm saying we're going with png's always,\n\n213\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:21.420\nin order to do that then I would\nhave to do a lot more checks.\n\n214\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.870\nI would have to say okay if it doesn't\nend with png then I need to make\n\n215\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.820\nsure that it doesn't end with something\nelse or I could read the file type.\n\n216\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.910\nBecause by default,\nthe browser has the ability to format\n\n217\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.010\nthe canvas as an image of JPG or PNG.\n\n218\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.900\nYou do not get GIFs or GIFs there,\n\n219\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.460\nI don't know, whichever way\nyou decide to pronounce that.\n\n220\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.460\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\nthat's been a question on my mind.\n\n221\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.040\nIs it gifs or is it jifs?\n\n222\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.128\n&gt;&gt; I actually say GIF.\n\n223\n00:12:52.128 --> 00:12:55.668\nBecause it's G-I-F and then like gift.\n\n224\n00:12:55.668 --> 00:12:56.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:56.257 --> 00:12:57.470\n&gt;&gt; G-I-F-T.\n\n226\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.780\nSo I call it gif but I've seen\npeople who are like nah, it's jif.\n\n227\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.621\nI'm like but it's not, that's not a J.\n\n228\n00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:05.229\n&gt;&gt; Jif's the name of a peanut butter.\n\n229\n00:13:05.229 --> 00:13:06.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWho knows.\n\n230\n00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:09.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, regardless of how you pronounce it.\n\n231\n00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:10.858\n&gt;&gt; I like gif.\n\n232\n00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:15.040\n&gt;&gt; I like gif because it's\nalmost a gift but not quite.\n\n233\n00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.332\nRegardless of whether you want the gif or\njif,\n\n234\n00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:24.730\nthe browser by default\ndoesn't have that available.\n\n235\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.680\nNow there are third party\nlibraries that you can pull in and\n\n236\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:33.360\nthe reason being that a GIF actually\nhas a binary header that has to,\n\n237\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.350\nthe file format is not supported natively.\n\n238\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.660\nNow the browser,\nthere are some JavaScript libraries.\n\n239\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.620\nThat will write those out.\n\n240\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.656\nI wanna keep this pretty straight\nforward so no gifts for us.\n\n241\n00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:50.640\nAlso making animated GIFs is doable\nwith those set of party libraries but\n\n242\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.480\nnow you need a multitude of images,\nand we would come back to those.\n\n243\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.460\nSo, PNGs or JPGs and\n\n244\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.880\nI made the decision that we are gonna\ngo PNGs, and the reason being is I get\n\n245\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.420\na transfer background JPGs by default if\nthere is no background it makes what?\n\n246\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.310\nWhat if I were to use this as an icon for\nsomething?\n\n247\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:13.850\nI'm not gonna be able to do that so,\nI'm gonna go PNG, and\n\n248\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.900\nkind of all floated to the user cuz I'm\ntypically gonna be the user of this.\n\n249\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.688\nTo be the one to make sure you\ndon't edit with .jpg or .gif.\n\n250\n00:14:24.688 --> 00:14:30.700\nBut even if you do, I'm still going to\nappend .png and make it a PNG type.\n\n251\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.540\nSo hopefully that'll\ncome across effectively.\n\n252\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.660\nSo there's the file name, okay?\n\n253\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.643\nAnd now, we need to grab the Canvas\nelement graphic information.\n\n254\n00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:46.770\nAll right, [SOUND] That is a lot.\n\n255\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.620\nSo how about we just call this data.\n\n256\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.110\nAnd we say this.canvas.to Data URL\n\n257\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.520\nand image,\nI think it's PNG is how it behaves.\n\n258\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.140\nSo what am I doing here?\n\n259\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.220\nI'm saying, at this moment,\nthis button is clicked.\n\n260\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.030\nI wanna grab the canvas called\n\n261\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.180\n230 URL which is a base 64\nencoded version of the image.\n\n262\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.640\nTo date a URL.\n\n263\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.390\nOr the image png type.\n\n264\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.490\nAll right?\n\n265\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.480\nSo we'll encode it as a png\nimage given the data URL.\n\n266\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.220\nStill kind of high level.\n\n267\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.870\nLet's see if I have the syntax right.\n\n268\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.650\nEvery once in a while I mess this up and\nI have to go look it up.\n\n269\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.720\nBut let's just console.log,\nand get that out there.\n\n270\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.560\nAnd if we save, let me say blank,\nand we hit okay.\n\n271\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.385\nNotice that I get this\ngiant string where it says,\n\n272\n00:15:41.385 --> 00:15:45.610\ndata:image/png;base64, and\nthen a bunch of stuff.\n\n273\n00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.239\n&gt;&gt; A bunch of stuff.\n\n274\n00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:52.327\n&gt;&gt; A bunch of stuff.\nNow, this is a base64, so\n\n275\n00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:55.635\nI have a bunch of characters\nthat represent numbers.\n\n276\n00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:57.178\n0 through 9.\n\n277\n00:15:57.178 --> 00:15:58.941\nSo 0 through 9 is 10.\n\n278\n00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:02.680\nI have 54 other characters.\n\n279\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.314\nSo I need all lowercase, all uppercase,\nand then something else,\n\n280\n00:16:06.314 --> 00:16:08.710\nprobably this slash or whatever.\n\n281\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:14.320\nNow, if I were to put this as an image,\nlike in an image tag, this will render.\n\n282\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.287\nIt knows how to decode these and\nrender the image itself.\n\n283\n00:16:18.573 --> 00:16:22.880\nI just need a strong representation,\nbecause now in order to download,\n\n284\n00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:33.422\nI now need to set this image data as\nthe source of an image that I've created.\n\n285\n00:16:33.422 --> 00:16:37.180\nSet a download attribute\nwhich is fairly new.\n\n286\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.801\nI'm gonna use kind a newer feature\nsince we're using newer features for\n\n287\n00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.820\nHTML5 and Canvas.\n\n288\n00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.456\nNow, HTML and Canvass has probably\n\n289\n00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:49.790\nbeen around maybe a little bit longer\nthan download don't quote me on that.\n\n290\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.723\nBut what I mean is an image tag that\nwould render the image normally can have\n\n291\n00:16:53.723 --> 00:16:54.813\ndownload portion.\n\n292\n00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:55.666\nAnd if it does,\n\n293\n00:16:55.666 --> 00:17:00.274\nthen we'll actually just download the\nresulting image to your local file system.\n\n294\n00:17:00.274 --> 00:17:04.391\nI would have to go look at the Mozilla\nDeveloper Network documentation to decide\n\n295\n00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:06.870\nwhich one's been around longer?\n\n296\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.614\nBut just keep in mind, Firefox, Chrome.\n\n297\n00:17:09.614 --> 00:17:13.147\nAnd if you ever wonder about these things,\n\n298\n00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:17.870\nif I go to caniuse.com, and\nwe might get it to load here.\n\n299\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.920\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n300\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.969\nAnd while we're doing that, we'll say\n\n301\n00:17:24.969 --> 00:17:31.020\nMozilla Developer Network image download.\n\n302\n00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.440\nActually, let's just go img.\n\n303\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.527\nSo if we go to img, here's our img tag.\n\n304\n00:17:38.527 --> 00:17:45.230\nAnd if we come down here and\nwe look, wait for it, wait for it.\n\n305\n00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:54.900\nWell look at that, As of recent times,\nthis is fairly new.\n\n306\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.770\nHTML standard doesn't give a list of\nimage formats that must be supported,\n\n307\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.890\nbut, sorry, we're in the image tag.\n\n308\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.775\nSorry, not in the two URL.\n\n309\n00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:06.576\nThe image tag does have a bunch of these.\n\n310\n00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:10.257\nSo if I go and I look for download,\n\n311\n00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:15.550\nthe download property, it's not here.\n\n312\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.819\nAll right, well, that's fine,\nwe can probably go perusing the browser.\n\n313\n00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:24.980\nBut you notice if it's not here,\nhow do I even know about it?\n\n314\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.570\nNow that's through additional research,\nright?\n\n315\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.814\nHow does this work?\n\n316\n00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:32.940\nLook, I gotcha.\n\n317\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:39.129\nThe image tag has a download attribute and\nthen I guess if I can say image download,\n\n318\n00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:45.687\nLet's go to img, right.\n\n319\n00:18:45.687 --> 00:18:47.360\nSVG, CSS,\n\n320\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.820\nsource hitting size attributes, can I use\nwill give you an idea of what browser?\n\n321\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.711\nSo for instance,\nthe ones in green account for\n\n322\n00:18:56.711 --> 00:19:01.400\n86% of global browsers\nbased on kind of a sample.\n\n323\n00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:06.456\nThat means that if I wanna use\nsource set and size attributes, and\n\n324\n00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:10.299\nI'm not entirely sure what those are,\nto be perfectly honest,\n\n325\n00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:13.802\nbut I would probably be all\nright about 87% of the time.\n\n326\n00:19:13.802 --> 00:19:17.803\nBut if I come down here and look,\nhas CSS relational pseudo class,\n\n327\n00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:21.190\nwhich is an unofficial,\nthat is 0% of browsers.\n\n328\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.470\nThat means if you use it and it works for\n\n329\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.450\nyou, it's a high likelihood that it's\nnot gonna work for other people.\n\n330\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.190\nSo I would make use of like can\nI use to find these things.\n\n331\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.615\nNow, [COUGH] it's not\nthe Mozilla developer\n\n332\n00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:36.934\ndocumentation that download attribute.\n\n333\n00:19:36.934 --> 00:19:38.670\nHow could I figure that now?\n\n334\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.460\nLet's go a ahead and create an image,\nAnd then to say image.\n\n335\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.590\nSee, that's an image tag, right?\n\n336\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.073\nLet's say image download,\n\n337\n00:19:58.084 --> 00:20:04.595\n=, and then this usually the file name.\n\n338\n00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:09.025\nSo let me do console.dir,\nOf image like so, and\n\n339\n00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:12.045\nthat way I get an actual\nlist of properties.\n\n340\n00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:19.220\nIt's not even really listed here,\nbut it's an implementation.\n\n341\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.910\nIt's a relatively new thing, which is if\nthis image has this download attribute,\n\n342\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.080\nit will download to the local file system.\n\n343\n00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:31.139\nAll right, so if no other reason,\nI'm telling you this should work,\n\n344\n00:20:31.139 --> 00:20:34.512\nwe're about to find out if\nmaybe I'm a liar or not.\n\n345\n00:20:35.853 --> 00:20:42.140\nSo the data here, I now need to download\nthe image, how do I download the image?\n\n346\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.743\nAll right,\nsp I'm gonna create an image, and\n\n347\n00:20:46.743 --> 00:20:51.994\nthat's gonna be a new image, Like so.\n\n348\n00:20:51.994 --> 00:20:56.891\nAnd, then I wanna say image.src = data,\n\n349\n00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:05.170\nbecause I'm setting that base 64\ndata as the source of the image.\n\n350\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.823\nAnd just to show you that it does work,\nlet's see here,\n\n351\n00:21:09.823 --> 00:21:13.784\nI'm just gonna say document.body.append,\n\n352\n00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:18.770\ndocument.body.appendChild image, like so.\n\n353\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.768\nAll right now,\nthere's some asynchronicity here,\n\n354\n00:21:21.768 --> 00:21:24.842\nwe might get some weirdness but\nit should be all right.\n\n355\n00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:29.614\nLet's just actually draw\nsomething on here, click save, and\n\n356\n00:21:29.614 --> 00:21:35.050\nlet's just call it cheese or\nsomething like that, and there it is.\n\n357\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.480\nIt actually appended it down below.\n\n358\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.912\nNow notice that it does not\nhave a white background.\n\n359\n00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:41.730\nAnd that's because I am using a PNG,\nit has a transparent background.\n\n360\n00:21:42.982 --> 00:21:47.449\nIf I wanted a white background, I would\nneed to paint the entire canvas white, and\n\n361\n00:21:47.449 --> 00:21:49.260\nthen repaint.\n\n362\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:55.533\nOr I could exchange the data type\nto jpg and to show you that,\n\n363\n00:21:55.533 --> 00:22:00.690\njpg like so, refresh,\nmake a swipe, hit save.\n\n364\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.630\nAnd then if I came down here, there it is.\n\n365\n00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.650\nActually, jpg I never actually\npainted the background with anything.\n\n366\n00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:10.350\nDid I change?\n\n367\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.950\nIt is still doing some weirdness\nbecause that png's there.\n\n368\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Justin is it time for\nlive action debugging?\n\n369\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.880\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna leave it be,\nbecause I would have to go back and\n\n370\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.430\nchange how I'm actually\ncreating the canvas.\n\n371\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.770\nWhat I'd have to do is grab all the canvas\ndata, create another canvas like a buffer.\n\n372\n00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:33.180\nPaint that as a background, and\nthen paint over the top of it.\n\n373\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:39.357\nAnd to be honest with you,\nI think this is rendering and\n\n374\n00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:43.840\ndoing some weirdness because I\nhave this file name as a .png, so\n\n375\n00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.260\nthey might be some clashes there.\n\n376\n00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:50.105\nJPGs for the most part, as far as I know,\n\n377\n00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:53.190\nshould never have\na transparent background.\n\n378\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.910\nBut what's happening here is,\n\n379\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:00.586\nI think the .png is doing some\noverride as the data type.\n\n380\n00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:02.218\nSo there you go.\n\n381\n00:23:02.218 --> 00:23:09.020\nSo png, and then instead of appending,\nwhat do we wanna do?\n\n382\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.450\nWe wanna say image.download, And\nthat should be the filename.\n\n383\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.140\nSo I'm gonna set that download\nattribute to the filename of the image.\n\n384\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.389\nAnd then, I want to say image.click.\n\n385\n00:23:23.389 --> 00:23:28.474\nActually, image, yeah, image.click.\n\n386\n00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:31.367\nNow that is going to simulate\nme clicking on an image, but\n\n387\n00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:32.890\nit doesn't actually exist.\n\n388\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.280\nI'm not putting it on the page,\nit just resides in memory.\n\n389\n00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.020\nNow Zach, we're gonna have to cross our\nfingers because if I've done everything\n\n390\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.570\ncorrectly, and I'm not saying I have.\n\n391\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.125\nBecause I just found some errors at the\nbeginning of this episode that I kind of\n\n392\n00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:46.009\nhave persisting.\n\n393\n00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:47.806\nIf I've done everything correctly,\n\n394\n00:23:47.806 --> 00:23:51.746\nthen this should download the image when I\nclick that save button and give it a name.\n\n395\n00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:52.500\n&gt;&gt; I believe in you, Justin.\n\n396\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.333\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's refresh.\n\n397\n00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:59.554\nCome over here,\njust to make sure we got some goodness.\n\n398\n00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:05.478\nAll right, so we close that out,\nMake a couple of slides and\n\n399\n00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:11.179\nwe'll go with your name mosquito goggles,\nthere we go.\n\n400\n00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:17.245\nSo, there's mosquito goggles and\nthen I hit OK and\n\n401\n00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:23.680\nI've messed something up,\nwhat have I done?\n\n402\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.510\nLet's see here.\n\n403\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.930\nActually I'm not entirely sure\nif I can immediately click\n\n404\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.670\nbecause Let's test something out here.\n\n405\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.777\nNow we're into live action debugging.\n\n406\n00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:38.936\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Zach loves it.\n\n407\n00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:42.355\n[LAUGH] It's not necessarily so\nmuch fun for me.\n\n408\n00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:44.400\n&gt;&gt; He might not like it,\nI think it's enjoyable.\n\n409\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.455\n[LAUGH] They are teachable moments, right?\n\n410\n00:24:46.455 --> 00:24:48.925\n&gt;&gt; That they are, so if I a pin child,\n\n411\n00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:54.240\nI should be able to click on that image\nlike it's appended at the bottom and\n\n412\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.040\nactually download that, but\nI'm missing something here.\n\n413\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.750\nOkay, so if I come over here and I look.\n\n414\n00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:10.920\nImage, it is not setting that download\nattribute, which is interesting.\n\n415\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.200\nSo Justin, the downloaded attribute\nis not being set on the image.\n\n416\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.900\nSo, what does that tell us?\n\n417\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's telling us\nthat I might have made a boo boo and\n\n418\n00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.360\nthere were some hints there that I\nwas like, no I got this, I got this.\n\n419\n00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.225\nIt's called a false sense of security,\nright?\n\n420\n00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:28.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I know what's going on now.\n\n421\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:33.040\nI think we are downloading an image, but\n\n422\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.700\nthe click download portion is not\nusually associated with an image tag.\n\n423\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.360\nIf I click an image,\nit opens into another browser.\n\n424\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.809\nI think that downloaded attribute, and\nwe are going to try to double check,\n\n425\n00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:49.390\nis actually a link,\na hyperlink, an anchor tag.\n\n426\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.440\nAll right, so okay,\nlet's do a couple of things here.\n\n427\n00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.052\nIf we come back into my screen,\n\n428\n00:25:55.052 --> 00:25:58.524\nlet's go look at the anchor tag cuz\nI was like, [SOUND] it's weird,\n\n429\n00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:02.565\nand previous times the download attribute\nis not available on the image tag.\n\n430\n00:26:02.565 --> 00:26:05.715\nAnd we didn't even see it in\nthe console and I was like, no,\n\n431\n00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:07.850\nI'm pretty sure I'm right.\n\n432\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.390\nAlways be careful about those\nfalse sense of security.\n\n433\n00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.950\nLet's actually change this to\nan anchor tag and all I did was this,\n\n434\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.960\nthese URLs in Mozilla are based\non the HTML element tag.\n\n435\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:27.540\nSo just change that to an a because\nthat stands for anchor.\n\n436\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.110\nIf I scroll down here, haha!\n\n437\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.480\nYou know what's that?\n\n438\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.800\nThat small little question\nkinda get them in.\n\n439\n00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.148\nI was like [SOUND], look at that.\n\n440\n00:26:37.148 --> 00:26:41.112\nThe attribute instructs the browser to\ndownload the URLs that are navigating to\n\n441\n00:26:41.112 --> 00:26:44.510\nthis so the user will be prompted to\nsave it to the local file system.\n\n442\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.570\nI am silly, I am silly.\n\n443\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.630\nSo, what I've done here is, I made\nthe assumption that it's an image that\n\n444\n00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.913\nI'm downloading so\nI must be using an image tag.\n\n445\n00:26:54.913 --> 00:27:01.130\nNo, in order to download, I actually need\nto use a link tag and I think it's good\n\n446\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:06.410\nto see these things because sometimes you\nmake a false assumption, and you're wrong.\n\n447\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.000\n&gt;&gt; So nobody-\n&gt;&gt; Let's go fix it and\n\n448\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.110\nhow am I going to fix it?\n\n449\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.524\nWell first off,\nwe're going to get rid of that.\n\n450\n00:27:12.524 --> 00:27:16.002\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're going to get rid of this and\n\n451\n00:27:16.002 --> 00:27:19.673\nI'm thinking we'll say const link equals,\n\n452\n00:27:19.673 --> 00:27:24.230\nnow we do have to do something\na little bit differently.\n\n453\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:29.109\nI can't just say new link, well I am\nunaware of being able to say new links, so\n\n454\n00:27:29.109 --> 00:27:32.130\nI'm gonna create an element called a,\nright?\n\n455\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:39.590\nCreate element a, just anchor tag and\nsay link.rhef=data.\n\n456\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.740\nWhich is a replacement to\nthis image portion, and\n\n457\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.350\nthen I'm going to say link dot\ndownload equals file name, all right?\n\n458\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.740\nSo I had to,\n\n459\n00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:55.560\nmy general thoughts were correct other\nthan that I had the wrong element type and\n\n460\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:01.770\nnow I should be able to\nsay link.click like so.\n\n461\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:06.650\nAll right, so if I link.click like so\nand I refresh.\n\n462\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.710\nNow we should be good to go.\n\n463\n00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.240\nI'm gonna close this out, just so\nwe can keep things, nice and.\n\n464\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.490\nLet's see here,\nbring this up to full color.\n\n465\n00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:21.124\nLet's make it, there we go and\nso we save and mosquito goggles.\n\n466\n00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:30.190\nLike so, and now I actually have,\nI misspelled mosquito.\n\n467\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.445\nOkay, so those of you who are looking.\n\n468\n00:28:32.445 --> 00:28:33.486\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I put mosquitgo.\n\n469\n00:28:33.486 --> 00:28:35.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering.\n\n470\n00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.730\nThat's not the easiest word to spell.\n\n471\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Mosquit goggles.\n\n472\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.280\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n473\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.140\n&gt;&gt; I do have a download of a PNG, now the\nreal test is so it actually opens locally.\n\n474\n00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.930\nSo if I click it, it opens and\nyou're kind of wondering,\n\n475\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:52.240\nwell that's kind of hard to see and that's\nbecause I have a transparent background.\n\n476\n00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.740\nNow if I go to place this on a page or\n\n477\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.100\nplace it over top of something\nthe transparent background won't be there.\n\n478\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.120\nHow could you, how could one fix this?\n\n479\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.380\nWell, you can come back and change how\nour application works and actually paint\n\n480\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.684\na white background, instead of just seeing\nthe white that we have here, right?\n\n481\n00:29:09.684 --> 00:29:12.650\nAll right, so if I or\n\n482\n00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.350\na lot of times if I go to print and\nnotice print.\n\n483\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.200\nI have black and white printer so\nit doesn't really matter about the colors.\n\n484\n00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.550\nNotice even transparent it's\ngonna be printing on white paper.\n\n485\n00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.970\nSo, if were to print this and\nI had a color printer,\n\n486\n00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.080\nit would print those colors but\n\n487\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.600\nbecause it's on a white paper, I'm just\nnot getting a background with an edge.\n\n488\n00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.430\nBut that's how we save an image and it was\nfairly straightforward but, just a nice\n\n489\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:43.050\nlittle different take on, when I click\nsave, I actually get the ability\n\n490\n00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.625\nto name the image instead of just giving\nit a random name like I have in the past.\n\n491\n00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:49.990\nWell Zack,\nwhen you finish your masterpiece\n\n492\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.620\nin our in browser image editor,\nthat's how you save a file.\n\n493\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.760\n&gt;&gt; I would pay five dollars for\nthat image.\n\n494\n00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.690\n&gt;&gt; Well I tell you what Zack, if you've\ngot five dollars on you right now,\n\n495\n00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.780\nI'll take it.\n\n496\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] HTML 5 Canvas Project,\nSaving the Image.\n\n497\n00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.450\nWonderful episode,\n\n498\n00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.230\nmake sure you watch every single episode\nof the HTML Five Canvas Project series.\n\n499\n00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.630\nJustin does a marvelous job.\n\n500\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.240\nJustin, any last words before we move on?\n\n501\n00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Well this is one of those things\nas I said earlier in the episode,\n\n502\n00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.650\na couple of things rather.\n\n503\n00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.830\nNon infallible, and\n\n504\n00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.130\nyou should not worry about,\nI didn't get it right on the first time.\n\n505\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.780\nThose things happen.\n\n506\n00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.630\nGo back and fix it,\nfigure out what's going on and\n\n507\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.000\neven though on camera it looks\nlike this happens very quickly.\n\n508\n00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.600\nSometimes those things, figuring out\nwhat's going on takes a little bit longer\n\n509\n00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.450\nthan maybe they appear here.\n\n510\n00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.145\nNumber two,\nthese are all kind of springboards, right?\n\n511\n00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:41.240\nYou got started on something.\n\n512\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.200\nThis is not the absolute limit\nof everything you can do.\n\n513\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.810\nI challenge you to add\nyour own little flair.\n\n514\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.630\nAdd something new, something different.\n\n515\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.760\nMake a change and well,\n\n516\n00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.850\nthat's how you're gonna grow as one\nwho develops, a developer, right?\n\n517\n00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.300\nSo always kinda push the boundaries.\n\n518\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.050\nStart with small ideas and\nthen work up to large ones.\n\n519\n00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Justin, awesome job.\n\n520\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.590\nYou know what else?\n\n521\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.820\nGo to the course library rather, and take\na look at all the hundreds of other videos\n\n522\n00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.070\nthat are there, and they are all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n523\n00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.560\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about Devpro.TV.\n\n524\n00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.600\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n525\n00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.320\nThanks for
