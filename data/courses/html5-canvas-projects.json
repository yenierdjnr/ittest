So this course is to really submit\nsome of the skills maybe you've acquired\n\n6\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.350\nthrough HTML5 canvas.\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.700\nI know what the canvas element is,\nI know the 2D rendering context,\n\n8\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.900\nbut how do these all come into play,\nwhat can I build?\n\n9\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.380\nSo what I've done during this\ncourse is created a few projects,\n\n10\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.020\na couple of games and\na couple of non-games.\n\n11\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.720\nWhere we can really apply the skills that\nwe know, the features about the HTML5\n\n12\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.630\ncanvas, as well as sprinkled in a few\nother things from web development.\n\n13\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.820\nWhat are we gonna build?\n\n14\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.250\nWell, we have a couple of simple\ngames like Atmos Attackers.\n\n15\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.020\nWe have little creatures coming down\nthe screen and we're fending them off.\n\n16\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.830\nWhat else?\n\n17\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.160\nWe have an image editor.\n\n18\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.430\nWe have the ability to paint and scribe.\n\n19\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050\nAnd well, a few other ones, but you'll\nhave to come and see to figure those out.\n\n20\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.050\n&gt;&gt; Now who is this show targeted towards?\n\n21\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.510\n&gt;&gt; So this show is definitely for someone\nwho has some previous web development\n\n22\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.430\nexperience and admittedly,\nsome HTML5 canvas element experience.\n\n23\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.200\nWhat does that mean?\n\n24\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.590\nThat means you need to know some\nJavaScript, you need to know some HTML,\n\n25\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.750\nyou need to know probably not\nas much CSS as some other people\n\n26\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.920\nmay require you to know.\n\n27\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.870\nBut if you don't know those, then a lot of\nthe things that I'm gonna be doing in this\n\n28\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.990\ncourse, well,\nthey're gonna become difficult.\n\n29\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.070\nThey may not have any real kind of\nimpetus of why I am doing them.\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.110\nSo, I would say this is more of\nan intermediate level skill set required,\n\n31\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.730\nin order to start leveling up.\n\n32\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.110\nNow, with that said, that does not mean\nthat it cannot be approachable for\n\n33\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.000\nsomeone who, maybe has just started, and\nwants to see what the capabilities are for\n\n34\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.750\nthe HTML5 canvas element.\n\n35\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.553\n&gt;&gt; Justin, is there a certification\navailable for this?\n\n36\n00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:52.680\n&gt;&gt; So for this course,\nthere is no certification available.\n\n37\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.710\nMainly because it's gear toward, I know\na little bit, and I wanna know more.\n\n38\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.300\nI want to take the next step.\n\n39\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.540\nI want to power up, level up, so to speak.\n\n40\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.184\nSo there is no explicit certification\nother than the wonderful warm,\n\n41\n00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:07.990\nfuzzy feeling that you get by\ncreating graphics within the browser.\n\n42\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.340\nAnd seeing some of the power that is\ndivvied out by the browser environment.\n\n43\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.440\n&gt;&gt; So what topics are covered in the show?\n\n44\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.112\n&gt;&gt; So this show is taking those\nHTML5 canvas elements, like figures.\n\n45\n00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:25.545\nI have the canvas element, I have the 2D\nrendering context, and now I wanna\n\n46\n00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.630\nlearn how to create data models,\nin order to create a user interface,\n\n47\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.800\nin order to create interactivity to\ncreate games like Atmo Attackers.\n\n48\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.080\nAs well as, how do I draw on this?\n\n49\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540\nWhat kind of data structures do I need?\n\n50\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.610\nHow do I think about this?\n\n51\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.690\nHow do I attack?\n\n52\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.593\nNow I know that was\nvery general in nature.\n\n53\n00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:50.598\nSo it is more about application\nof the HTML 5 canvas element and\n\n54\n00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:53.670\nits associated kind of pieces.\n\n55\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.640\nAbout how to attack and\napproach solving a problem.\n\n56\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.846\nI have an idea for\nsomething I want to build.\n\n57\n00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:02.424\nHow do I take the skill set\nthat I know a little bit about,\n\n58\n00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:05.481\nplan it out, and\nthen make it come to fruition.\n\n59\n00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, this sounds like\nsomething you're excited about.\n\n60\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.350\nAnd I know I am.\n\n61\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.980\nYou're going to make sure to watch every\nsingle episode of HTML5 canvas projects.\n\n62\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.564\nThank you for watching DevPro TV.\n\n63\n00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.967\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
