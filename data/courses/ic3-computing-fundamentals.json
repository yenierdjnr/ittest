00:00:19.524\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and you are\nwatching the IC3 Computing Fundamentals\n\n4\n00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.673\nshow where we are about to take\na look at some mobile devices and\n\n5\n00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:26.760\ntalk about some of the different things\nthat we need to understand there.\n\n6\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.830\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.950\nWes, welcome to our show.\n\n8\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.764\n>> Thank you, sir, it's good to\nbe here as always with ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:35.330\nAnd that's right, we're gonna be\nlooking at mobile devices today.\n\n10\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.890\nAnd we're gonna talk\na little bit about well,\n\n11\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.620\nwhat is more importantly a cell phone.\n\n12\n00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.130\nCuz there's many different\nmobile devices and\n\n13\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.890\nwe'll talk about some of those\ndevice types in a later episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.736\nBut for us today,\n\n15\n00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:48.303\nwhat we're gonna be focusing in on\nreally is the concept of the cell phone.\n\n16\n00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:51.900\nAnd how long have the cell\nphones been around?\n\n17\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.930\nWell, they've been around since,\nI wanna say, like the late 70s or\n\n18\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.650\nthe early 80s was the first time somebody\nmade a call over the air through\n\n19\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.940\nradiated energy and wasn't plugged in,\nif you will, to the wall.\n\n20\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.800\nI joke around with people and\nI tell them I had a cell phone once and\n\n21\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.790\nI got it all the way to Georgia\nuntil the cord came out of the wall.\n\n22\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260\nBut all joking aside, we're gonna\nlook at the mobile phone here, and\n\n23\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.030\nwhen it comes down to a mobile phone,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n24\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.520\nWell, we're talking about a device that,\n\n25\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030\nfirst, like the name\nimplies is the mobility.\n\n26\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.096\nThe ability to move this device and not be\nlocked into the traditional land lines.\n\n27\n00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:27.685\nNow they are more and\nmore prevalent today, and\n\n28\n00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:32.490\nmaybe you've heard of this term and maybe\nyou haven't, BYOD, bring your own device.\n\n29\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.165\nThey are in the home environment,\nthey are in the enterprise environment and\n\n30\n00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:41.990\nwe're having many millions of them as we\nspeak are probably being made right now.\n\n31\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.044\nSo looking at a mobile phone,\n\n32\n00:01:44.044 --> 00:01:49.314\nlet's talk about how I would get a mobile\nphone before I even start to use it?\n\n33\n00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:53.492\nWell, mobile phones you typically go to a\nvendor or provider and you purchase them.\n\n34\n00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.721\nNow these are subscription based devices\nin which you have to have a subscription\n\n35\n00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:58.850\nin order to use them.\n\n36\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.980\nIt's not like a desktop.\n\n37\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.868\nRight, if I purchase, let's say go to\na vendor and I purchase a desktop,\n\n38\n00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:04.760\nI bring it home.\n\n39\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.376\nWell, guess what, I don't need to talk\nreally to any kind of subscription\n\n40\n00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:12.085\nprovider in order to use that desktop.\n\n41\n00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:13.995\nOn the other hand,\nif I have a mobile phone,\n\n42\n00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.265\nif I don't talk to a subscription\nprovider and pay a monthly fee,\n\n43\n00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:22.980\nthe mobile phone's really gonna\nbe useless for us in that aspect.\n\n44\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.030\nSo let go ahead, let's dive right in.\n\n45\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.446\nI've actually got a mobile phone\npulled up here on my computer, right.\n\n46\n00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:31.142\nAnd with these mobile phones today,\n\n47\n00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:33.941\nthey definitely differ a lot\nthan they did in the early days.\n\n48\n00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:37.971\nWith these mobile phones today, these\nare really, when it comes down to it,\n\n49\n00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:39.470\nthese are small computers.\n\n50\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.250\nThese are very, very powerful devices and\nthey allow us a lot of functionality.\n\n51\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820\nAnd what we really wanna look at is,\n\n52\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.775\njust some of the basics on how you\nwould use a cellphone to begin with.\n\n53\n00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:52.060\nWe're gonna look at some\nof the settings and\n\n54\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.740\nthen we'll gonna talk a little bit\nabout how you would use one to dial out\n\n55\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.260\nand make a call.\n\n56\n00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.430\nAll right, so\n\n57\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.930\nthis is the interface and there's\na couple of different types of phones.\n\n58\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.650\nThis is by far, when we talk about\nthe input and working with the phone,\n\n59\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.030\nit's one of the more common ones.\n\n60\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.590\nYou can't really see it right here,\nit's kinda off camera here.\n\n61\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.580\nBut this is a touch screen interface.\n\n62\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.490\nAnd you can see on my computer\nscreen where I'm actually inputting,\n\n63\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.590\ntouching the screen if you will.\n\n64\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.210\nNow the other type that we have is one\nthat's been around for a while as well and\n\n65\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.390\nthat's the one that has more\nof the tactile push button.\n\n66\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.960\nThey're still out there,\n\n67\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.080\nthey're very prevalent but the most common\none today are the touch interfaces.\n\n68\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.600\nAnd they're typically\ntoday called smartphones\n\n69\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.680\nversus another term that maybe you have or\nhaven't heard called the dumbphone, right.\n\n70\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.150\nThe older phones back in the 90s and even\nthe mid 2000s with Blackberry and stuff\n\n71\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.420\nand again they have the tactile keyboard\nand sometimes you could use a stylus.\n\n72\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.310\nWhen you look at these smartphones today,\nagain, primarily what we have is\n\n73\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.935\nthe touch interface as the means\nof working with the phone itself.\n\n74\n00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:00.860\nLet's go ahead and look at some of the\nsettings that you could configure in your\n\n75\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.420\ncell phone so you'll be a little\nbit more aware of how to use it.\n\n76\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.190\nNow understand that what we're on\nright now is a Windows mobile phone.\n\n77\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.780\nSome of the major mobile phones that\nyou have, really the big three,\n\n78\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.680\nif you will, and I say big really big two,\nas Ronnie and I were talking about\n\n79\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.770\nit prior to coming on stage here,\nis that we have, well, we have the iPhone.\n\n80\n00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.300\nThe iPhone definitely is one that kind\nof revolutionized the entire cellphone\n\n81\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.780\nindustry, being one of the first\nthat really provided that fluid,\n\n82\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.380\nthorough touch interface.\n\n83\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.030\nThe other one being the Samsung\nbased devices, and this is Android.\n\n84\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.849\nNot Samsung, excuse me,\nI'm thinking of my phone.\n\n85\n00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:35.752\n>> Android based.\n\n86\n00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:37.008\n>> Yeah, the Android devices.\n\n87\n00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:39.180\nNow when we look at\nsomething like an iPhone or\n\n88\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.782\nwe look at something like an Android,\nthey're definitely two completely\n\n89\n00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.190\ndifferent markets even though\nwe're talking about cellphones.\n\n90\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.180\nWhen we look at iPhone, iPhone is what's\nknown as a close source proprietary phone\n\n91\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.090\nin which the operating system that\nruns on it is controlled by Apple and\n\n92\n00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.970\nthe hardware itself is controlled\nby Apple likewise as well.\n\n93\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.540\nNow with the Android devices,\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n94\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.660\nThey have many different\ndevices that an Android\n\n95\n00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.190\nphone operating system more\nspecifically will run on.\n\n96\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.060\nAnd you have many different vendors out\nthere, Samsung being one of the ones that\n\n97\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.339\nI think about cuz that's\nthe cell phone that I have.\n\n98\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.740\nAndroid is an open source platform.\n\n99\n00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.400\nAnd there's a little bit\nof a major difference here.\n\n100\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.240\nWhen we say proprietary,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n101\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.724\nWell, when we talk about proprietary,\nwhat we mean is that, again,\n\n102\n00:05:30.724 --> 00:05:34.140\none company basically\ncontrols all the code.\n\n103\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.700\nThey don't release it to the public,\nit's maintained in-house, internally.\n\n104\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.598\nAnd if, let's say, if Ronnie was\nto get a piece of that code and\n\n105\n00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:44.277\nsay, hey, let me go ahead and\ndo some designing on that and\n\n106\n00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:47.340\nmaybe try to put that on a phone\nthat maybe he's working on, well,\n\n107\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.460\nthe company that owns that software,\nthat proprietary software,\n\n108\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.960\nthey could end up suing him for\neverything that he's worth, right?\n\n109\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.530\nWell, that's what the iOS, the operating\nsystem that runs on the iPhone is,\n\n110\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.540\nit's closed source and even the hardware\nbehind it, Apple controls it.\n\n111\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.010\nNow you look at something like Android,\nwhen we say open source,\n\n112\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.970\nwe say non-proprietary.\n\n113\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.745\nAll right, what this means is that, and\nI'm pretty sure when it came to Android,\n\n114\n00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:14.521\nit started out with something known as the\nOpen Handset Alliance that started this\n\n115\n00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.026\noperating system based on the Linux\nkernel, and Google comes along and they\n\n116\n00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:21.944\nsay well, we really like this, we wanna\ngo ahead, and they purchased the company.\n\n117\n00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:25.500\nNow today it's considered\nGoogle's platform, if you will.\n\n118\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.925\nBut it is still open source in the fact\nthat the code that the operating system,\n\n119\n00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:37.040\nright, what allows us to even use\nthe cellphone, it's freely downloadable.\n\n120\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.540\nYou can make contributions to it, and\n\n121\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.720\nthere's a lot of variance\nout there as well.\n\n122\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.430\nBut one of the great things about that\nis the fact that if you decide to make\n\n123\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.876\nchanges or modifications to the operating\nsystem you're really not gonna be charged.\n\n124\n00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.120\nSo I wanna kinda set the stage for\n\n125\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.790\nwhat cellphones you might see out there\nand then some of the operating systems.\n\n126\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.210\nSo with that being said,\n\n127\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.210\nthe other one is maybe not quite\nas popular as the first two.\n\n128\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.940\nThose first two are definitely\nthe most popular.\n\n129\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.370\nThe third one there is the mobile phone.\n\n130\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.900\nAnd the mobile phone, or the Windows,\nexcuse Windows mobile phone, and\n\n131\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.260\nthis has got different variants,\ndifferent flavors of the operating system.\n\n132\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.740\nAnd this is also a closed source operating\nsystem in which Microsoft basically\n\n133\n00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.790\nmaintains the operating system and\n\n134\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.390\nthey have a limited amount of\nhardware that it supports.\n\n135\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.400\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nlook at that a little bit more.\n\n136\n00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.470\nSo let's go ahead, let's dive back in.\n\n137\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.390\nWe're gonna look at some of the settings,\nand we'll talk about some of the different\n\n138\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.150\nsettings that are on phones that\nare common to all of them regardless of\n\n139\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.010\nthe phone and\nthe operating system that you have.\n\n140\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.160\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna drill down in here to Settings.\n\n141\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.482\nAnd a lot of times what you have,\n\n142\n00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:48.988\none of the first things that you might\nwanna be able to figure out is, how to,\n\n143\n00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:54.174\nwell, let's just say maybe send an email,\nmaybe send a text message.\n\n144\n00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.190\nBut more than all,\nyou're gonna wanna be able to, well,\n\n145\n00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.541\nuse the cellphone to call somebody, right?\n\n146\n00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.019\nWe talk about a smartphone and\n\n147\n00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.984\nthe fact that it's a computer\nthat can do multiple things.\n\n148\n00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.225\nBut we also wanna look at the basics too.\n\n149\n00:08:06.225 --> 00:08:07.791\nHow do you even make a phone call?\n\n150\n00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:12.926\nAnd with this one here, you can see that\nthere's a little bit of a phone icon,\n\n151\n00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:16.330\nthey call it a tile,\nhere in this interface.\n\n152\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.070\nAnd If I needed to make a call,\nI could do it.\n\n153\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.330\nAnd you can see in this\noperating system here,\n\n154\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.660\nit tells me that we can do things\nlike speed dialing, right?\n\n155\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.160\nAnd then history as well is there.\n\n156\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.330\nSo if I've made calls, if Ronnie's\ncalled me and I happen to miss a call.\n\n157\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.640\nWell, it'd be nice to know\nwho it is that called me and\n\n158\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.408\nhave some kind of a reminder that hey,\nyou missed a call.\n\n159\n00:08:35.408 --> 00:08:38.580\nWell we could see that in\nthe history as well as\n\n160\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.110\nthe people that maybe we call ourselves.\n\n161\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.130\nAnd then there's a button\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n162\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.110\nYou have a series of buttons here.\n\n163\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.100\nYou can see that this one, the one all the\nway to the left, that's your voicemail.\n\n164\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.920\nLet me get back in there, sorry guys.\n\n165\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.770\nThat's your voicemail.\n\n166\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.220\nWe'll talk a little bit\nabout that coming up.\n\n167\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.070\nAnd then you have your keypad, and\nthe keypad really brings up the numerical\n\n168\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.650\nkeypad and this would allow you\nto enter the text if you will.\n\n169\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.330\nIf you wanted to you could, for\ninstance, dial a phone number here and\n\n170\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.310\nyou could call in,\nsomething like that, right?\n\n171\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.230\nAnd then all I have to do is I could\njust choose call and, provided we have\n\n172\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.780\nour subscription paid, we can make\na call to the other end, all right?\n\n173\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.720\nNow that being said,\n\n174\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.840\nfairly straight forward when it\ncomes to using a cell phone.\n\n175\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.140\nIt doesn't take much as far as dialing and\nmaking a call.\n\n176\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.130\nAgain, voicemail is\nsomething else that we have.\n\n177\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.720\nBut the really cool thing is,\nwe also have this other icon down here and\n\n178\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.780\nthis is your contacts icon, right?\n\n179\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.700\nYour contacts icon can\nbring you right into what,\n\n180\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.570\nif you can think back to the old,\nfor instance, the old Rolodex,\n\n181\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.270\nI know many people probably don't\nknow what a Rolodex is anymore.\n\n182\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.140\nWhen you had contacts you would write\nthem down, you'd have a little book you\n\n183\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.410\nwould write down all your contacts,\nand then if I need to call Ronnie and\n\n184\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.680\nI don't know what his number is,\nI could look into that little paper file.\n\n185\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.440\nWell, obviously we're not going\nto carry those around, so\n\n186\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.070\nit makes it convenient in the fact that\nwe can have our contacts right here.\n\n187\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.600\nAnd if we need to dial those contacts,\nwe can, all right?\n\n188\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.870\nNow we also have the search functionality,\nright?\n\n189\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.030\nAnd the search functionality gives me\na little bit easier way, in this case,\n\n190\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.160\nto just search through those contacts\nwithout actually having to scroll through.\n\n191\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.680\nAll right, so fairly straight forward\nprocess when it comes to using the cell\n\n192\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.990\nphone to make a phone call.\n\n193\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.210\nHowever, there are other things that you\nmight wanna be able or have the ability to\n\n194\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.130\ndo, so let's go ahead and\ncontinue through some of those settings.\n\n195\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.900\nAll right, now the first one I\nwanna talk about are the email and\n\n196\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.610\nthe accounts, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.140\nIf you are going to allow your\ncell phone to receive and\n\n198\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.260\nsend email,\nyou do have to set up your accounts.\n\n199\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.330\nAnd whichever phone you have,\nit might differ a little bit, but\n\n200\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.860\nessentially the steps should\nbe pretty much the same.\n\n201\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.770\nYou have things like your Gmail accounts\nthat are out there, Exchange accounts.\n\n202\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.690\nYahoo accounts, I don't know, maybe a AOL,\nI don't know if they still exist.\n\n203\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.250\nBut we could set those\nup if we wanted too.\n\n204\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.090\nAnd you could see, I have a Microsoft\naccount already attached to this.\n\n205\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.170\nAnd if I wanted to,\nI could add an account.\n\n206\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.080\nAnd you could see some of\nthe options that we have, right?\n\n207\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.030\nExchange, if you have a business account,\nyou could setup an Exchange account.\n\n208\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.500\nIf you, Outlook.com.\n\n209\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.480\nThey old Hotmail if some of you maybe\nguys know what the old Hotmail was.\n\n210\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.630\nWe could set that up and\nthen there's also, and\n\n211\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.060\nyou could see the provider by the way.\n\n212\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.706\nThis third one down here,\nthis is the actual provider of the phone.\n\n213\n00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:29.280\nSo when we talk about the subscriptions,\nI would have to pay AT&T\n\n214\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.870\na monthly subscription fee in order\nto well, basically use this phone for\n\n215\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.310\nanything other than to dial out and\nsend text messages.\n\n216\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.900\n>> Now Wes,\nwhen we start taking a look at this,\n\n217\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.880\nyou're showing us the idea of\nthe manual setup of things.\n\n218\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.270\nAnd normally the reason why we\nhave to use this a lot of times is\n\n219\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.570\nif we're switching from one\nprovider to another one.\n\n220\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.870\nIf I'm adding an additional email,\nit's kind of neat in the world\n\n221\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.340\nof cellphones when we start taking\na look at our mobile devices.\n\n222\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.830\nAnd the very fact that if I get\na brand new let's say Samsung S7, and\n\n223\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.390\nit's straight from whoever I purchased\nit from, if they were actually my\n\n224\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.640\nservice provider as well, I really don't\nhave to do a lot of the manual set up.\n\n225\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.500\nIt's not saying that what Wes is\nshowing us is not valuable, but\n\n226\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.430\na lot of times it takes you through\nstep-by-step when you first have it.\n\n227\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.470\nSo if this is your first introduction into\nthe realm of actually getting a cell phone\n\n228\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.720\nand go, I know I wanna get email,\nI know I need to set up my voice mail,\n\n229\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.290\nI know I need to set up a bunch\nof different things here.\n\n230\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.050\nIt's neat, because it sends you through\nan initial setup wizard the first time.\n\n231\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.310\nAnd, if you've already been\nusing something like email,\n\n232\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.600\nlike I have a Gmail account.\n\n233\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.540\nAll I have to do is actually enter in my\nGmail account and my password to that\n\n234\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.639\naccount, and then the rest of it,\nat least on Android devices, it knows how\n\n235\n00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:54.180\nto connect all that stuff in, and it goes\nahead and it sets up the email for me.\n\n236\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.120\nIt sets up my voice messaging,\nif I've got that service, for me.\n\n237\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.320\nAnd it's not that those things\naren't invaluable like I said.\n\n238\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.970\nBut a lot of times, for\nsomething like what Wes is showing us,\n\n239\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:09.050\nif you now decided you wanted the Yahoo\naccount on your phone as well,\n\n240\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.460\nhe's showing us where you actually go\nin there to add that Yahoo account.\n\n241\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.355\nAnd then you'd have to get\na bit more information.\n\n242\n00:13:16.355 --> 00:13:20.195\nBut just, so don't get overwhelmed by a\nlot of the stuff that you're seeing right\n\n243\n00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:21.896\nhere if this is your first time seeing it.\n\n244\n00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:25.220\nJust kind of realize with just a couple\nof pieces of information, right Wes?\n\n245\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.105\nUsually an email and a password, and\n\n246\n00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:32.480\na lot of the features that we can just\ntalk about as far as basic phone usage.\n\n247\n00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.370\nIf we've got a service provider,\nit really does set itself up, right?\n\n248\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.350\n>> It does, and that's one of the great\nthings about it is just the fact that you\n\n249\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.690\nhave those introductory wizards if it's\nthe first time that you've had the phone.\n\n250\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.600\nThe other thing being is, a lot of\nthe times when you're purchasing a phone,\n\n251\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.390\nyou're going to have the person\nthat's doing the sales,\n\n252\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.690\nis pretty much going to\nset the phone up for you.\n\n253\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.980\nBut if you're supporting the phone,\nyou are the sales person.\n\n254\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.470\nHow do you do that if\nyou don't have a wizard?\n\n255\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.127\nSo you do have to keep in mind\nthere is an automated approach, but\n\n256\n00:13:59.127 --> 00:14:01.092\nyou are troubleshooting a phone,\n\n257\n00:14:01.092 --> 00:14:05.690\nI don't know how many times that\nOutlook has given me problems, right?\n\n258\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.295\nWell, the problem is, one of the things I\ndo have to keep in mind is I unfortunately\n\n259\n00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:12.697\ndon't get a wizard when it comes to\ntroubleshooting what's going wrong with\n\n260\n00:14:12.697 --> 00:14:15.090\nOutlook or this individual mail provider.\n\n261\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.910\nNow the other thing that we have\nwe're gonna look at a little bit too\n\n262\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.242\nis some of the basics like a lock screen,\nright?\n\n263\n00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:25.110\nLock screen is very important when it\ncomes to keeping your phone secure.\n\n264\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.630\nIt's not really advised\nto keep it unlocked.\n\n265\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.250\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you that real quick.\n\n266\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.160\nAnother one of the main settings here.\n\n267\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.090\nIf I choose the lock screen\nI can set things like, for\n\n268\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.560\ninstance, the background if I want.\n\n269\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.740\nBut more importantly,\nhow long before the screen times out.\n\n270\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.830\nAnd then a password too.\n\n271\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.070\nThat's important again for\nthe protection of the phone.\n\n272\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.550\nAll right, now the other thing that we'll\nlook at a little bit too is notifications.\n\n273\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.620\nNotifications are important right?\n\n274\n00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.580\nHow intrusive the notifications\nare is really up to you.\n\n275\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.800\nI know personally I try not to\nhave too many notifications.\n\n276\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.020\nHowever, my wife on the other hand she\nwants to know when anything goes on.\n\n277\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.420\nSo she's constantly getting bombarded by\nnotifications, so we can also do that.\n\n278\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.950\nWe can choose notifications and\nagain, keep in mind,\n\n279\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.190\nthat it might be a little bit different\ndepending on what phone you have.\n\n280\n00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.267\nFor instance, I can see a quick scroll\nhere, what are by quick actions here.\n\n281\n00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:22.609\nI could say as far as\nmy network connection,\n\n282\n00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:24.263\ndo I have blue tooth turned on?\n\n283\n00:15:24.263 --> 00:15:29.007\nDo I not have it turned on, if you will,\ncamera, and even the brightness settings.\n\n284\n00:15:29.007 --> 00:15:31.610\nAnd it allows me a quick\nway to change these.\n\n285\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.710\nI can also, again, if I want, I can change\non how gadgets and different things.\n\n286\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.350\nMessaging apps, banners,\nsound, vibrations on that.\n\n287\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.040\nMaybe you're giving a presentation.\n\n288\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.880\nIn fact with myself right now,\nI've got my phone but it's muted.\n\n289\n00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.460\nThe volume's turned down because I don't\nwant those notifications interrupting what\n\n290\n00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.210\nwe're doing right now.\n\n291\n00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.560\nSo also keep that in mind.\n\n292\n00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.669\nAn etiquette when it comes to your\nphones as well with notifications and\n\n293\n00:15:56.669 --> 00:16:01.736\nmaking sure that if you're in a situation\nin which somebody's giving a presentation,\n\n294\n00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:06.133\nyou might wanna make sure that those\nnotifications aren't too intrusive.\n\n295\n00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:11.061\n[COUGH] Now, Wes when we start to\nlook at the idea of just getting that\n\n296\n00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:16.550\nphone to do some basic communications and\nI'm starting to set it up.\n\n297\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.670\nThere's really a couple of things\nthat I remember really annoying\n\n298\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.000\nme at the beginning.\n\n299\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.360\nWhich was I know that I needed to know\nhow to actually dial a person's phone so\n\n300\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.720\nthat's kind of intuitive because I've been\nusing phones pretty much my entire life.\n\n301\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.779\nBut the other one was actually a little\nbit more challenging which was to get\n\n302\n00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.142\naccess to my voicemail.\n\n303\n00:16:37.142 --> 00:16:41.590\nWhen somebody said, yeah just set up\nyour voicemail or check your voicemail.\n\n304\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.110\nAnd so we want to talk about that\nnotion for just a little bit of time.\n\n305\n00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.170\nWes, if somebody tells me and I've\nnever setup my voicemail before, let's\n\n306\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.100\njust talk about some of the primary things\nthat most every provider actually give us.\n\n307\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.000\nSo if somebody said, Wes,\nI don't know how to setup my voicemail.\n\n308\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.160\nWhat would you just tell them\nright then that they needed to do?\n\n309\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.470\n>> Well,\ntypically that's a great question.\n\n310\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.900\nTypically, what we'll end up having is\nsome kind of special number that you'll\n\n311\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.680\ncall in order to access your voicemail\nand, right out the gate when you first get\n\n312\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:19.410\nyour phone, chances are at best you have\nthe most generic message if any at all.\n\n313\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.560\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n314\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.870\nWell, if somebody calls you and\n\n315\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.190\nyou haven't set up your voicemail,\nyou usually get one of two things.\n\n316\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.900\nYou get a this voice mail\nhasn't been set up for\n\n317\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.950\nthis phone number and well, it hangs up on\nyou and nobody can send you a voicemail.\n\n318\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.540\nThe other is that it gives\nyou a generic voice,\n\n319\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.230\nI'll give you one that mine was set up and\nI didn't realize it when I first got my\n\n320\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.540\nphone, is that it says the number you\nhave called can't take calls right now.\n\n321\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.710\nAnd it's very basic, simplistic voice\nthere, and it said leave your message.\n\n322\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.870\nAll right, well, voice mail systems,\nvoice messaging systems, they allow for\n\n323\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.700\nthe customizations, right?\n\n324\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.680\nAnd one of the first things that you're\ngonna do is find out the vendor,\n\n325\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.440\nhow you access that voicemail system.\n\n326\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.150\nFor instance, mine in this case,\nfor the provider that I have is,\n\n327\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.690\nthat on my phone,\nI type star 89 When I type star 89 it\n\n328\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.600\ntakes me right into a special account\nthat is just for my voicemail.\n\n329\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.800\nAnd then once I get there you\ntypically have an automated process.\n\n330\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.140\nIf you've ever called somebody for\nsupport it says press one to do this,\n\n331\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.420\npress two to do this,\npress star to hear more options.\n\n332\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.400\nA lot of times that's what your\nvoice mail systems are gonna do for\n\n333\n00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.290\nall of the vendors.\n\n334\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.200\nThey're gonna say, to set up your inbox\ngreeting, you're gonna set your message.\n\n335\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.760\nThat would be usually\nthe first thing you'll do.\n\n336\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.970\nAnd I'll say, hi, my name's Wes Bryan.\n\n337\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.090\nYou've reached my phone.\n\n338\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.780\nI can't get to the phone right now.\n\n339\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.260\nIf you'd leave me your name and number and\na small message, I'll get back with you.\n\n340\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.930\nAnd then this way when people are calling\nin, that's the thing that they hear.\n\n341\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.240\nNow, you also have things\nlike your voice mailbox,\n\n342\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.070\nmight have just a basic greeting, right.\n\n343\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.380\nIt might say Wes Bryan, right.\n\n344\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.530\nSo sometimes when you call or\nwhen somebody calls you,\n\n345\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.030\nand they get you're busy and\nyou can't answer it.\n\n346\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.012\nIt says you've called the voice mailbox\nof, and then you'll hear my voice,\n\n347\n00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:07.636\nWes Bryan.\n\n348\n00:19:07.636 --> 00:19:12.427\nRight, so, again it can be little more\neccentric if you will, where you can,\n\n349\n00:19:12.427 --> 00:19:15.911\nI always do this,\nI can never get the recording right, so\n\n350\n00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:18.540\nI have to record it more than once, right.\n\n351\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.620\nSo that's one of the biggest things and\nthe first thing you need to do is set up\n\n352\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.470\nwhat the message is that people are gonna\nhear when they have an incoming call and\n\n353\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.630\nyou don't get to it.\n\n354\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.753\nNow the other thing that you can typically\ndo inside of your voicemail when it comes\n\n355\n00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:30.439\nwith messaging.\n\n356\n00:19:30.439 --> 00:19:34.393\nThe messages themselves, you can listen\nto the messages by pushing a certain key,\n\n357\n00:19:34.393 --> 00:19:37.838\nyou can save the message and depending\non what the retention policy is for\n\n358\n00:19:37.838 --> 00:19:41.793\nyour local provider they'll say, well this\nmessage will be saved for 90 days and\n\n359\n00:19:41.793 --> 00:19:45.060\nyou don't have to worry\nabout it being deleted.\n\n360\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.660\nThe other thing you can do is\nforward messages likewise, so don't\n\n361\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.330\nbe afraid if you've never set up a\nvoicemail to get in there and try, right?\n\n362\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.360\nGet in there and set it up and\nif you don't like what you've set up,\n\n363\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.250\nthat's one of the great things,\nit's not a one size fits all for sure.\n\n364\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.240\nIt can be customized.\n\n365\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.880\nEach individual person might\nwant a unique experience, and\n\n366\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.400\nkeep in mind that your voicemail\nmessage should be simplistic.\n\n367\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.420\nI know some people want to make it\na Martin Scorsese production but keep in\n\n368\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.130\nmind it needs to be simple and to the\npoint so that, I almost said end users.\n\n369\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.800\nThe people who are calling you\ndon't hang up because you've got\n\n370\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.970\na five minute message and they have to\nwait forever to leave you that message.\n\n371\n00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.940\nSo that's one of the piece of advice I\nwould give you is just keep it simplistic.\n\n372\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.460\nThe other thing that you\nmight want to pay attention,\n\n373\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.610\nis to how many messages\nyou might be able to have.\n\n374\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.470\nSome vendors limit the amount\nof messages that you have.\n\n375\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.500\nSo, you definitely want\nto be able to check them.\n\n376\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.850\nAnd you definitely want to\nbe able to manage them.\n\n377\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.730\nFinally, what I'll say, just as a recap,\n\n378\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:46.180\nis remember that every voicemail\nmessaging system is unique.\n\n379\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.016\nWhile they both follow the same basic\npattern, setting up your voicemail\n\n380\n00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:56.008\nincoming message and then some kind of\nnumerical key that you have to punch,\n\n381\n00:20:56.008 --> 00:20:58.826\nto push, to forward through the process.\n\n382\n00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:03.744\nThe only thing that is typically unique\nis the individual minutiaes if you will\n\n383\n00:21:03.744 --> 00:21:08.030\non the different flare functionality\nthat they give you access to.\n\n384\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.630\n>> Yeah Wes, when I first setup\nmy voicemail on my phone,\n\n385\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.730\nI didn't really know how to do it.\n\n386\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.690\nI had to get some instructions, but\n\n387\n00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.360\none of the things that I did stumble upon\nthat can really help you out if you can't\n\n388\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.780\nfind those directions, is to simply\ncall the number that you have been given\n\n389\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.410\nthrough your service provider for\nyour phone.\n\n390\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.550\nA lot of times that actually starts you\noff by saying, hey, I noticed something,\n\n391\n00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.380\nyou actually reached that phone number\nfrom the phone number that was assigned to\n\n392\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.640\nthat particular device, and\nthen it asked you to go ahead and set up.\n\n393\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.570\nDo you want the option set up for\nvoicemail or do you want to do this?\n\n394\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.606\nAnd then normally requires\nyou to setup a PIN number and\n\n395\n00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:46.898\nit requires you to leave at least one\nmessage so that now people can access it.\n\n396\n00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:50.503\nAnd then from that point you can do what\na lot of people do which is to just have\n\n397\n00:21:50.503 --> 00:21:51.992\nthat as one of your contacts and\n\n398\n00:21:51.992 --> 00:21:55.715\nthen when that way somebody does call you\nwith a voicemail you just go ahead and\n\n399\n00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:59.608\nname a voicemail and then you push that\nbutton, then it calls your number again,\n\n400\n00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:03.420\nand you entering your PIN number\nto retrieve those codes, as well.\n\n401\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.440\nSo that's one of the features that\nare available to help us at least at\n\n402\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.740\nthe beginning, and\nwe're not familiar with it.\n\n403\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.700\nThe other one though, is probably\nthe feature that most people end up\n\n404\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.450\nusing with their phones,\nmore often than anything else.\n\n405\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.120\nAnd so Wes, people call this\na lot of different things.\n\n406\n00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.460\nHere in the states,\nwe call it texting a lot of times.\n\n407\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.660\nBut technically this is called SMS?\n\n408\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.850\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n409\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.090\nNow we're not gonna be short of acronyms\nin computer fundamentals and Ronnie's\n\n410\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:34.220\nexactly right, SMS But I completely agree\nwith Ronnie in the fact that most likely\n\n411\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.740\nif you hear the term texting, that's\nreally what's going on in the background.\n\n412\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.490\nIt's a system that's been around for\na while.\n\n413\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.630\nIt's probably one of the most\ncommon messaging services we have.\n\n414\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.570\nIt allows you to send text based\nreal quick text based entries.\n\n415\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.050\nSometimes there's\na character limit on them.\n\n416\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.670\nLike for instance my phone I just\nhappen to look at this last night,\n\n417\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.260\nhas a 141 character limit.\n\n418\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.550\nYou can attach things like\npictures if you want.\n\n419\n00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.300\nYou could do that as well.\n\n420\n00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.730\nPrimarily when it first\nstarted it was text based.\n\n421\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.090\nIt's definitely been advanced a lot since,\n\n422\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.600\nI believe it was 83\nwhen it first came out.\n\n423\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.240\nNow, the other thing too that's\ngreat about SMS or text messages\n\n424\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.980\nis that they integrate nicely with\ntraditional telephony technologies, right.\n\n425\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.790\nIf you've never heard of the term,\n\n426\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.750\nwe're just talking about\ntraditional phone lines, right.\n\n427\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.910\nIs the fact that these messages can\nmake their way over traditional phone\n\n428\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:29.810\nlines in a lot of systems.\n\n429\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.120\nSo it really makes them very\nversatile in their application.\n\n430\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.510\nNow when it comes to sending a text\nmessage, let me go ahead and\n\n431\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.230\nshow you guys.\n\n432\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.346\nWhen you're sending a text message here,\nit's fairly easy.\n\n433\n00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:46.455\nI've got this nice little thought\nbubble here and messaging there.\n\n434\n00:23:46.455 --> 00:23:49.406\nNow that I've fumbled around for\nit a little bit here, we'll go ahead and\n\n435\n00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:50.748\nlook at the text messaging here.\n\n436\n00:23:50.748 --> 00:23:55.535\nSo, you can see the little plus symbol\nright down here and this plus symbol would\n\n437\n00:23:55.535 --> 00:24:00.177\nallow me to start typing a text and what I\nwould do is I would put the contact here\n\n438\n00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:04.977\nand whoever the contact might be and then\nI could start typing the text message.\n\n439\n00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:10.494\nI could do something\nlike This Is my text or\n\n440\n00:24:10.494 --> 00:24:13.600\ntest, if you will.\n\n441\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.170\nAnd then what that allows me to do,\nis once I put the contact in there,\n\n442\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.700\nif I just go ahead and push send,\nit'll send that text message only.\n\n443\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.580\nRight, it's not a phone call so\nwe're not communicating with them\n\n444\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.140\nother than through a text based method,\nif you will.\n\n445\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.950\nNow, remember one of the things that I\nsaid that you could do here is that you\n\n446\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.380\ncould send an attachment.\n\n447\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.890\nIf I wanted to,\nI could also add a picture, add a video.\n\n448\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.200\nNow, I want you to keep\nin mind something though.\n\n449\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.430\nIf you're not familiar with these data\nplans, remember you start sending these\n\n450\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.800\ntext messages and a lot of times,\ndepending on your subscription,\n\n451\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.590\nright, you could get text message for\nreally cheap today.\n\n452\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.120\nBut, if you start adding video, if you\nstart adding attachments through this,\n\n453\n00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.420\nit's gonna chew through your data plan and\nit's gonna cost you more money.\n\n454\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.070\nSo just keep that in mind that this\nis a great way to send a quick,\n\n455\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.890\nfast message to somebody.\n\n456\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.710\nIt's relatively inexpensive, but\n\n457\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:12.130\nas you start adding attachments, you could\nstart adding a little bit more value,\n\n458\n00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.250\nor charge, if you will,\nto your regular SMS-based text messages.\n\n459\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.440\nSo very basic here.\n\n460\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.780\nAnd at this point, once I was done all\nI would have to do is just click Send,\n\n461\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.130\nand it would send that text message,\nlet's say in this case, to Ronnie.\n\n462\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.560\nAnd then if I dialed the number right or\nused the contact, I got the right contact\n\n463\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.220\ninformation, Ronnie's gonna end\nup receiving that text message.\n\n464\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.760\n>> Yeah, the neat thing or\n\n465\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.210\nthe nice thing then about the idea of\nusing text messages is that not only\n\n466\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:44.370\ncan we do that one to one communication\njust like a regular telephone call, but\n\n467\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.890\nlet's say that Wes wanted a group\nof us to go and meet for lunch.\n\n468\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.920\nWell in theory if we were just doing this\non a telephone call, Wes would call me,\n\n469\n00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.120\nand then call somebody else, and\nthen call somebody else, and\n\n470\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.050\nthen call somebody else, let's say four or\nfive different phone calls to do so.\n\n471\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.720\nWith the text messaging system though,\nif he knows what my phone number is,\n\n472\n00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.390\nhe can actually add in all of our phone\nnumbers and just say, hey let's go and\n\n473\n00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.240\nmeet for pizza for lunch today and\nthen send that and\n\n474\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.820\nit sends it to all of those people\nin who the destination is for.\n\n475\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.550\nAnd this way even if I'm in\nthe middle of working, I will\n\n476\n00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.270\nget that message without having to pick\nup the phone and so will everybody else.\n\n477\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.480\nAnd then we can respond individually and\n\n478\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.740\nthat will also forward it on to\neverybody in that group as well.\n\n479\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.370\nNormally when you start doing that.\n\n480\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.590\nSo the idea of messaging,\nthis seems to kind of, almost,\n\n481\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.791\nat least here in the United States to be\none of the most predominant reasons why we\n\n482\n00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:40.000\nend up using the phone is the ability\nto get these quick messages\n\n483\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.910\nthat we need to to\nthe people that we need to.\n\n484\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:47.090\nAnd a lot of time it's taken even over\nreally the social side of things where\n\n485\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.460\nyou do walk into restaurants today and you\nsee people sitting at the same table and\n\n486\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.450\nthey're actually either\ntexting other people or\n\n487\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.190\neven each other as they're actually\nsitting right across from each other.\n\n488\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.790\nSo you do have some of that\nthat tends to go on there.\n\n489\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.730\nBut remember that the primary idea here\nbehind that cell phone is the idea\n\n490\n00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.400\nhere of being able to communicate and\nestablish that communication that we need.\n\n491\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400\nAnd we do have different\nmethods that are out there,\n\n492\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.020\nit goes from the very most basic thing\nwhich is simply to have a telephone call.\n\n493\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.250\nAnd voice mail just like we used to have\nanswering machines by our phones, now we\n\n494\n00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.730\ncan actually carry that with us regardless\nof where we are on this planet as well.\n\n495\n00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.780\nAnd then of course you even have\nfancy ones, which Wes was actually\n\n496\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.780\nmentioning and even showed us here, in\nthat model of that Windows phone for us.\n\n497\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.200\nAnd because we have barely scratched the\nsurface on that Windows phone technology,\n\n498\n00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.800\njust by talking about the idea the phone,\nand of course the text messaging and\n\n499\n00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.610\neven the voicemail type setup and even\na basic notification on things as well.\n\n500\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.090\nSo there is a lot of features that\nare actually in here with us Wes,\n\n501\n00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:54.160\nis there anything we need to know about\njust the basics of the mobile device\n\n502\n00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.380\nthat we've been talking about?\n\n503\n00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.970\n>> No, I would say just subscription.\n\n504\n00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:01.350\nSubscription is the important thing,\nkeep in mind that the features and\n\n505\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.150\nfunctionalities that you have is really\nbased on the provider that you're\n\n506\n00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.350\ngonna use as your carrier.\n\n507\n00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.280\nSo Like Ronnie said we've already,\nwe've talked about some of the basics.\n\n508\n00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.060\nKeep in mind that you will\njust tailor make these, or\n\n509\n00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.490\ntweak them a little bit just to suit\nwhatever the provider is that you have.\n\n510\n00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.140\n>> All right Wes, well thank you again for\n\n511\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.190\nhelping us to understand at least\nthe basics of these mobile devices.\n\n512\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.390\nThere's a lot more for\n\n513\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.050\nus to actually think about when it\ncomes down to computing fundamentals.\n\n514\n00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.600\nBut at least you are getting a start here\non these mobile devices if you haven't\n\n515\n00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.570\nencountered them before.\n\n516\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.680\nAnd it is a great place for us to end this\nepisode as we also move on to new and\n\n517\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.880\nother episodes that we\nare going to be doing.\n\n518\n00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.460\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI have been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n519\n00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.520\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n520\n00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.654\nStay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n521\n00:28:48.654 --> 00:28:55.414\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.380\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.490\nAnd you're watching the IC3 Computing\nFundamentals show, where we're about\n\n5\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.110\nto take a look at some of the different\ntypes of computers that you and\n\n6\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.480\nI may encounter as we\nenter into the workforce,\n\n7\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.330\nwhere we're starting to work\nwith computers on a daily basis.\n\n8\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330\nNow everything that we see right here,\nright, you may see some of them,\n\n9\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.320\nyou may not.\n\n10\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910\nBut you at least need to have a concept\nof what they are, and who better\n\n11\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.740\nto help us than Mr. Wes Bryan to help us\nunderstand some of these different ones.\n\n12\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.450\nWelcome back Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.850\n>> Thank you for having me here.\n\n14\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.670\nThat's right it's great to be with ITProTV\nand we are going to look at some of those\n\n15\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.620\ndevice types and one of the first\nthings that we're gonna look at is,\n\n16\n00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.120\nwell, the traditional desktop PC.\n\n17\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.970\nAnd this has definitely gone through many\nchanges since it's first release way back\n\n18\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.210\nin God I wanna say 80 something, early\n80s when IBM well, first delivered it.\n\n19\n00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.750\nAnd thank goodness that they're\nnot the size of refrigerators,\n\n20\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.620\nlike they used to be.\n\n21\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.030\nNow let's keep in mind what a desktop is,\nwhen we say a desktop,\n\n22\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.720\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n23\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.560\nAre you talking about a desk and\nthe top of the desk?\n\n24\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.370\nNo, it's just a term that we use for\na small personal computer,\n\n25\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.370\nhence the name PC.\n\n26\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.600\nIt usually has what's\nknown as a computer case.\n\n27\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.280\nAnd when we talk about the size of\nthe desktop in relation to the hardware\n\n28\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.560\nitself, a lot of times what we're talking\nabout is something known as a chassis,\n\n29\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.130\ntower, or case.\n\n30\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.380\nNow we're gonna look at some more of the\nintricacies of the towers in general when\n\n31\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.020\nwe look at some of\nthe hardware components.\n\n32\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.250\nBut for now we just wanna understand\nthat what we're talking about is really\n\n33\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.030\nthe size of the computer.\n\n34\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.760\nAnd it all boils down to what\nis the size of the case.\n\n35\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.030\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n36\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.150\nHere in my computer I've got,\nRonnie was just making a joke here.\n\n37\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.610\nYou guys didn't get to hear it, that he\nremembers when that computer first came\n\n38\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.020\nout, maybe not this specific model but\ncertainly when computers were this big.\n\n39\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.910\nThey were probably the size of your desk.\n\n40\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.520\nAnd who knows, they might have been\ncalled desktops because, well,\n\n41\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.610\nthey came up to the top of\nthe desk in those days.\n\n42\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.340\nNow, Ronnie do you remember something\nlike this when it was the size of\n\n43\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.438\na small refrigerator?\n\n44\n00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:19.490\n>> [LAUGH] Well, this one's a little bit\nsmaller than a small refrigerator but\n\n45\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.160\njust a little bit larger than a dinosaur.\n\n46\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.484\nNo, but overall though when you\nstart seeing something like this,\n\n47\n00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:29.039\nmost of these computers today that we\ntend to have that we call desktops,\n\n48\n00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.860\nit has this basic functionality and what\nwe need to work with on a daily basis.\n\n49\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.030\nAnd that's the key.\n\n50\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.190\nMost the time if you're in a work\nenvironment, you're probably going to\n\n51\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.550\nend up with a computer that's gonna have\na monitor, a keyboard, probably a mouse.\n\n52\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.210\nAnd sometimes and probably a lot of times,\n\n53\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.470\nthere may actually be a device that's\nsimilar to this, if not smaller,\n\n54\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.740\nbut looks similar, that's gonna be\nsitting in that same area with you.\n\n55\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.090\nAnd that willl be your\nworking desktop computer.\n\n56\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.680\nNow Wes, one of the limitations\nbehind a machine like this\n\n57\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.080\nis that we are essentially tethered\nto that area that we are working in.\n\n58\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.390\nAnd so when you need to do computing and\nyou roll away from the desk,\n\n59\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.670\nyou always have to come back to it, and\nso the location to where this thing is,\n\n60\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.980\nis pretty much the key here.\n\n61\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.760\nAnd even though it's portable,\nwhich means that you can move it\n\n62\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.280\nfrom one area to another one, the problem\nis moving it from one area to another one\n\n63\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.750\nis actually even a little bit\nmore challenging than you think.\n\n64\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.870\nSometimes the computer itself is heavy,\nbut even then you still have to go and\n\n65\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.860\nconnect everything back\nup once you move it.\n\n66\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.880\nSo as portable as it is,\nit's really not mobile per se.\n\n67\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.200\n>> Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n68\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.130\nAnd it's funny, you don't have to do this,\nbut if you go watch some of the history on\n\n69\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.370\ncomputers they would have called\nthis a portable computer.\n\n70\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.120\nNot mobile by any means, a portable\ncomputer because In those days when these\n\n71\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120\nwere first coming out, computers were\ntypically the size of an entire room, and\n\n72\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.920\nthey certainly weren't going anywhere\nunless the building was coming down.\n\n73\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.990\nSo this did give you\nthe first type of in-home\n\n74\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.230\nappliance that you could have\nthat could do computing.\n\n75\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.185\nNow more commonly today that we see, and\neven though I do call this more of a full\n\n76\n00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:06.260\nsized computer, it actually would be more\nof the midsize computer in relation.\n\n77\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.172\nSo some of the earlier ones that\nwere even taller than that,\n\n78\n00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:09.740\nlike Ronnie's already mentioned.\n\n79\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.842\nNow another common one here\nthat we have is the microtower.\n\n80\n00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:19.330\nThe microtower is really one of the most\ncommon, if you will, desktop PCs.\n\n81\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.900\nWhy is that?\n\n82\n00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.580\nWell it goes back to what\nRonnie was talking about.\n\n83\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.020\nNot so much in the mobility aspect,\nbut we wanna save some space, right?\n\n84\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.933\nWe want these typically,\nwe're gonna have all the extra peripherals\n\n85\n00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:34.596\nthat we're gonna talk about\nin later episodes, and\n\n86\n00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:39.027\nwe need them to fit within\nthe confine of a certain desk itself.\n\n87\n00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.166\nThe micro case if you will,\n\n88\n00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:46.190\nmicro PC is one of the ones that\ndoes happen to be the most common.\n\n89\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.370\nNow there's another one\nthat's out here too and\n\n90\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.820\nthat's called the slimline and\nit's about half the size of this.\n\n91\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.960\nSome of you might have seen it\nbefore in things like banks, right,\n\n92\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.770\nbanks or schools.\n\n93\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.800\nSchools, and\nin fact I know my son's school\n\n94\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.400\nhas what are called the OptiPlex I believe\nthey're the 720s or something like that.\n\n95\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.120\nAnd now we're literally\ntalking four inches thick.\n\n96\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.340\nThey sit on their side and\nthey put the monitor on top of those.\n\n97\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.570\nAgain you can also see them in things like\nbanks where the computer case is very,\n\n98\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.280\nvery small.\n\n99\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.610\nAnd that's really about, again,\n\n100\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.900\nnot so much as it is mobility,\nmore than it is just space saving and\n\n101\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.320\ngetting a lot of these computers\nin a relatively small space.\n\n102\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.150\nSo that's another one that you could\ndefinitely see when you come down to it.\n\n103\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.170\nNow what are the benefits over\nlet's say the full size case,\n\n104\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.460\nor even the midsize case\nas we would say today?\n\n105\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.910\nEven some of the biggest gaming\nunit cases are really still midsize\n\n106\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.640\ncases compared to the earlier ones.\n\n107\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.970\nSo what's the benefit?\n\n108\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.060\nRight, why would we want to get one of\nthese midsize cases, if you will, or\n\n109\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.760\neven one of these micro cases and\n\n110\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.400\nit really comes down to the functionality\nof the unit, in totality.\n\n111\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.925\nAnd what I mean by that is bigger cases,\na lot of times,\n\n112\n00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:01.065\nwill allow for more customizations, right?\n\n113\n00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:05.665\nIf you have more space inside of\nthat case, a lot of times you can\n\n114\n00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.892\nadd more functionality by\nadding additional components.\n\n115\n00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:12.072\nI want you to think about,\nmaybe a small car, like,\n\n116\n00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.712\nfor instance, I got a small KIA, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:21.032\nAnd let's just say, theoretically,\nI didn't really worry about money,\n\n118\n00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:24.852\nthere's not a lot of modifications\nI could make inside of that KIA,\n\n119\n00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:26.832\ncuz there's no space to\nput anything else in.\n\n120\n00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:29.730\nSo I'm pretty much limited\nto what I have now.\n\n121\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.920\nBut if you step back in time a little bit,\n\n122\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.980\nwe go back to one of those muscle\ncars back in the 60s, right?\n\n123\n00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.120\nYou could put a big block engine in\nthe car, and then you could jump inside,\n\n124\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.500\nnext to the engine, and shut the hood,\nand still have more space to add all\n\n125\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.770\nthe different components that you\nreally want to beef up that engine.\n\n126\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.170\nWell, it's really no different\nwhen it comes to desktops.\n\n127\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.550\nIf you end up having the full size\ndesktop, right we need better video.\n\n128\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.100\nWhat can I do?\n\n129\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.150\nI can put multiple video cards.\n\n130\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.530\nAnd if this all new to you,\nthe video cards,\n\n131\n00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.620\nwe're gonna have an episode where we're\ntalking about what that actually means for\n\n132\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.480\nus, but now I get a better\ngaming performance, right.\n\n133\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.231\nMaybe I want cooling inside of my system,\n\n134\n00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:17.577\nwell in a smaller system we're limited\nto the size of the cooling units, right,\n\n135\n00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:22.780\nto keep the system from overheating and\nrunning at its best functionality.\n\n136\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.765\nWhen I have a bigger case, well chances\nare more often than not, I can put more\n\n137\n00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:32.079\nparts in there which includes maybe\neven a better cooling system.\n\n138\n00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:37.030\nExpandability, we've talked in\nanother episode about storage, right.\n\n139\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.410\nOur hard drives are gonna\nbe in those cases.\n\n140\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.070\nWell maybe I wanna put 15 drives in there.\n\n141\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.480\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be 15 drives.\n\n142\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.054\nBut I want the ability that says hey, I'm\nstarting out today with maybe two drives.\n\n143\n00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:52.744\nBut then tomorrow I know I'm gonna\nhave to put in eventually more and\n\n144\n00:07:52.744 --> 00:07:54.569\nmore storage capacity, right?\n\n145\n00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.238\nWell if I have one of those\nMid-size cases I can do that.\n\n146\n00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:02.053\nYou start getting down into the micro\ncase, you start limiting the amount of\n\n147\n00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:04.630\ncustomizations that you\ncan do inside of the case.\n\n148\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.860\nNow, that sounds like a major drawback,\nI know, that sounds like a killjoy.\n\n149\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.470\nI'm not trying to be killjoy here\nbecause the benefit, cost efficiency.\n\n150\n00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.803\nI remember an old Compaq that I got\nthat was definitely half the size of\n\n151\n00:08:16.803 --> 00:08:19.461\nthe big beast that I got\nsitting at the house right now.\n\n152\n00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:22.217\nIt was like $300, right, for\nthe whole thing, the whole unit and\n\n153\n00:08:22.217 --> 00:08:23.770\nI think they even threw the printer in.\n\n154\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.610\nSo cost efficiency in a micro tower,\na micro case if you will,\n\n155\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.320\nthat's where you start\nto see the benefits.\n\n156\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.360\nMaybe you do lose the ability to add some\nadditional functionality to really get\n\n157\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.200\nin there and beef it up later, but\nthat probably, in buying that computer\n\n158\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.080\nyou probably weren't the demographic\nthat needed that anyways, right?\n\n159\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.350\nIf you're just sending email,\nyou're getting on there and\n\n160\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.240\nyou're playing a couple of small games,\nthat's probably perfect for you.\n\n161\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.650\nWell, now we get down in,\nagain to that slim line case,\n\n162\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.260\nwhat is the benefit of the slim line case?\n\n163\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.430\nWell one of the big benefits is, more\nthan anything, is space saving, right.\n\n164\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.290\nThere's not a lot of customization\nthat you can do, but there again,\n\n165\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.600\nthe demographic is typically for\nthings like institutions, schools,\n\n166\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.910\nhospitals if you will, banks, because they\ndon't need a lot of extra functionality.\n\n167\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.650\nWhat they need to be able to do,\nis pull up a line of business\n\n168\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.220\napplication that connects to\na certain amount of information, and\n\n169\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.120\nthat's all they need to do.\n\n170\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.540\nThey're not worried about taking\nthat latest and greatest video game,\n\n171\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.070\nmaxing out the settings, and\nrunning the processor until it melts.\n\n172\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.220\nSo, again, there are benefits to each one.\n\n173\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.160\nThere's a place and application for\neach one, but then again,\n\n174\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.720\nthere are also pros and cons,\nso the cons come along with it.\n\n175\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.130\nThat there are limitations to\nthe different size of the towers or\n\n176\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.010\nthe type of computer that you get.\n\n177\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:49.080\nSo do your research, make sure you know\nfor one if you are purchasing a computer,\n\n178\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.570\nwhat functionality you need,\nwhat functionality do you expect to get.\n\n179\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:57.060\nAnd we talk about the life cycle of the\ncomputer that you might be supporting or\n\n180\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.130\nmight be building,\n\n181\n00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.210\nhow long do you do expect it to last might\ndictate which one of these cases you get.\n\n182\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.310\nSo, do keep that in mind when it\ncomes down to your desktop PCs.\n\n183\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.720\nNow, the other one,\nI've talked about PC as well.\n\n184\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.000\nWe'll take a second here because it's not\nthe only type of computer platform that we\n\n185\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.860\nhave out there.\n\n186\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.330\nI wouldn't be doing you any justice\nif I didn't talk about Mac,\n\n187\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.390\nMacintosh has been out there as well.\n\n188\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:25.290\nAnd again, they have their own line and\nmost of it's proprietary to Apple.\n\n189\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.670\nBut, it also has its place\non a market as well.\n\n190\n00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.910\nSo, we do have to mentioned that,\nlikewise.\n\n191\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.265\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n192\n00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:35.931\nEven though we've taken a look at this\nidea of desktop computing and where it\n\n193\n00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:40.015\nactually limits us, at least to that one\nlocation and we have different varieties.\n\n194\n00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:43.039\nWe still have one more factor\nthat's actually the same, but\n\n195\n00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:46.194\nit really has nothing to do with\nthe size or the expandability.\n\n196\n00:10:46.194 --> 00:10:48.390\nWes, what are we actually\nlooking at at that point?\n\n197\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.522\n>> We do have another one.\n\n198\n00:10:49.522 --> 00:10:54.398\nI did mention the slim line case and\nthat's being in things like institutions,\n\n199\n00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:57.690\nright, things like hospitals,\nthings like banks.\n\n200\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.430\nWell, if it's just connecting\nto an application and\n\n201\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.030\nyou're not worried about all of\nthat power that we'll talk about,\n\n202\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.410\nall that horsepower, like we said\nin one of the old muscle cars.\n\n203\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.210\nWe also have what are known as thin line,\nor excuse me, thin clients.\n\n204\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.165\nAnd I actually have one\npulled up right here, and\n\n205\n00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:18.566\nthe thin client,\nif we'll get this in the camera here.\n\n206\n00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:19.519\nThere we go.\n\n207\n00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:23.923\nNotice, Ronnie can you take a guess as to\nwhy they would call that a thin client?\n\n208\n00:11:23.923 --> 00:11:24.737\n>> I think it's cuz it's thin.\n\n209\n00:11:24.737 --> 00:11:26.350\n>> [LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n210\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.850\nNotice that there isn't much\nspace here at all, right.\n\n211\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.090\nWe don't have barely anything.\n\n212\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.380\nIf we were to open this up,\n\n213\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.900\ninside of this there'd be a very limited\namount of memory, if much at all.\n\n214\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.110\nThere'd be a very small processor and\n\n215\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.900\nyou can see here that Ronnie's\nshowing us the back side of it.\n\n216\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.247\nIt really gives us the ability to connect\ninput devices, right, keyboard and mouse,\n\n217\n00:11:48.247 --> 00:11:49.680\nif you will.\n\n218\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.290\nOne monitor, this one look's like it's\ngot a couple different monitor types.\n\n219\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.650\nAnd then that network connection that's\nthere is very, very important because,\n\n220\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.300\nwith the thin clients, all they're\nreally doing is connecting to another\n\n221\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.090\nmassive computer, and that massive\ncomputer is doing all the work for us.\n\n222\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.250\nSo if we're in a bank\nsituation where again,\n\n223\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.900\nall the end user really needs is just\nthat screen in front of them and\n\n224\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.260\nto be able type in just a little\nbit of input and see some output,\n\n225\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.080\nbut they don't really need much\nmore functionality than that.\n\n226\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.130\nThen what this does is\nit gives your more so\n\n227\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.075\nyour IT staff the ability that\nthey don't have to go and\n\n228\n00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:32.370\ntroubleshoot these self contained systems\none by one, and what do I mean by that?\n\n229\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.638\nWhat's the difference between\na slim line case and a thin client?\n\n230\n00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:40.360\nA slim line client, if you will,\nit's still again what we call the client.\n\n231\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.750\nI kinda throw that word out there thinking\nyou would know what that word is.\n\n232\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.876\nLet me talk about what that means.\n\n233\n00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:48.770\nA client means it's self contained\noperating system that has all its own\n\n234\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.030\nprocessing capability and local storage.\n\n235\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.080\nWith the thin client however,\nnothing is local.\n\n236\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.380\nNothing is in the device,\nthe storage or the hard drive,\n\n237\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.110\nit's all being saved on another location.\n\n238\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.990\nSo, it does have its benefits,\n\n239\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.290\nand it has its drawbacks like all\nthe other ones that we've talked about.\n\n240\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.610\nWhat's the first drawback?\n\n241\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.630\nAll right, we'll go ahead and\nbe pessimistic here.\n\n242\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.940\nWhat's the first drawback?\n\n243\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.330\nI really can't upgrade these too much,\nexcept for maybe adding a little bit of\n\n244\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.270\nsystem memory, which again,\nwe're gonna discuss coming up.\n\n245\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.550\nI might be able to do that.\n\n246\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.980\nBut we don't have very, if any,\nlocal storage at all, right?\n\n247\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.950\nSo you don't have the ability\nto customize it too much.\n\n248\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.380\nOnce you buy one of these devices,\n\n249\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.466\nyou're pretty much locked into\nthe device that you have.\n\n250\n00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:36.670\nThe slim line case, even though it\ndoesn't have much upgradability,\n\n251\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.500\nit still does have a limited amount\nthat you might be able to do and\n\n252\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.370\nit's still a self contained machine\nthat's doing all of its own processing.\n\n253\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.870\nSo, the thin clients,\na lot of times what you'll see those is,\n\n254\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.050\nare in things like schools and\ninstitutions.\n\n255\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.030\nAnd maybe even businesses where what\nthey don't wanna have to do is,\n\n256\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.480\nthey don't wanna have to go to machine\nto machine to machine servicing\n\n257\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.610\nlocally stored information.\n\n258\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.210\nThese give an alternative\n\n259\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.080\nto where people can centrally manage\nall of that with the thin client.\n\n260\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.540\nAll the thin client's doing is\nit's using network communications\n\n261\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.990\nto connect to a larger computer.\n\n262\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:16.510\nSo again, it does have its place\ninside of our industry here.\n\n263\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.210\n>> All right Wes, so let's talk about some\nof the other types of hardware that's\n\n264\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.690\nactually available to us.\n\n265\n00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.410\nThe desktop computing, like we said,\n\n266\n00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.710\nreally does help us out when we need\nto actually work with computers.\n\n267\n00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.190\nAnd most of us that are going to\nbe entering into the industry,\n\n268\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.850\nwhere we're gonna be working\nwith computers on a daily basis,\n\n269\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.510\nall these that Wes describe are kind\nof the ones we'll end up seeing.\n\n270\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.240\nBut in today's world as we actually\nmove into modern computing as well,\n\n271\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.790\nyou're gonna see that we\nare no longer going to be tied\n\n272\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.520\ndirectly just to a single cubicle or\neven to an office anymore.\n\n273\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.940\nAnd this is where we need to\nmove into the realm of mobility.\n\n274\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.600\nWe talked about portability at\nthe beginning here which allows us to move\n\n275\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.410\nfrom one location to the other, but during\nthat time we're actually disconnected from\n\n276\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:03.315\npower, we don't really have anything, but\nwe do have the ability to very compactly\n\n277\n00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:07.975\nand to have essentially in a single box\nour entire unit, where we can move it.\n\n278\n00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:12.862\nBut now what we're talking about though\nis how do we do computing on the go?\n\n279\n00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:17.052\nWhat type of hardware do we need\nthat if I am actually moving around\n\n280\n00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:19.882\ncan I still maintain my connection?\n\n281\n00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:22.207\nCan I still actually do\nthe computing that I need to?\n\n282\n00:15:22.207 --> 00:15:26.012\nAnd Wes is about to tell us about some\nof the devices that we can actually see.\n\n283\n00:15:26.012 --> 00:15:27.412\nSo Wes what are we gonna start with?\n\n284\n00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:27.942\n>> Very good.\n\n285\n00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:31.732\nOne of the first ones that we're really\ngonna look at is something known\n\n286\n00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:33.189\nas a tablet.\n\n287\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.190\nThere is a great necessity like Ronnie is\n\n288\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.100\nsaying to be able to move\nfrom location to location.\n\n289\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.910\nOr even if you're in the same location you\ndon't want to be tied down to your desk.\n\n290\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.565\nAnd that's where a tablet's functionality\ncomes in to play for us, right?\n\n291\n00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:53.206\nThe tablet functionality what it allows\nus to do is it allows us to still have\n\n292\n00:15:53.206 --> 00:15:56.906\naccess to all of our computing\ndocuments if we so choose to.\n\n293\n00:15:56.906 --> 00:16:00.998\nBut we have the ability to transport this\ndevice pretty much anywhere we want.\n\n294\n00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:05.615\nAbout the only limitation you might have\nis the fact that if you move it too far\n\n295\n00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:09.310\nfrom a network,\nyou might lose network connectivity.\n\n296\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.110\nBut then they also have things\nlike cellular communications.\n\n297\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.730\nOn a previous episode we talked\nabout mobile communications.\n\n298\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.110\nWell, one of the great things about\nthis is you can go to the same type of\n\n299\n00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.450\nproviders that you do for\nyour cell phones.\n\n300\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.340\nAnd you can actually get what\nare known as broadband cards.\n\n301\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.810\nAnd they allow you to continue\nnetworking even when you're on the move.\n\n302\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.780\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n303\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.230\nWe actually got a Surface tablet here and\n\n304\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.190\nyou can see that we\nhave a touch interface.\n\n305\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.120\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more\nabout these interfaces coming up.\n\n306\n00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.390\nSo I don't want you to worry about that.\n\n307\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.330\nJust know that how I\ninteract with the machine is\n\n308\n00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.760\nreally just swiping across the keyboard.\n\n309\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.430\nAnd then I have the ability that if\nI wanna launch different things,\n\n310\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.860\nI can launch things just\nby touching the screen.\n\n311\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.580\nI touch the screen here, you can see\nWindows or File Explorer's open.\n\n312\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.620\nAnd you can notice that if I want to,\nI can move this window\n\n313\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.760\naround the entire screen here, or\nwhat would be typically the desktop.\n\n314\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.520\nRight, notice that I get the ability\nto work with it here, you can see that,\n\n315\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.880\nhow thin it is, very, very thin.\n\n316\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.490\nSo again, we do get that ability,\n\n317\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.390\nmore than anything else it's just\nthe mobility aspect of this.\n\n318\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.799\nTo be able to continually work\nwith your computing systems but\n\n319\n00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.018\ndo it while you're on the run.\n\n320\n00:17:19.018 --> 00:17:22.861\nRight, these are beneficial if maybe\nyou're a business person, right, and\n\n321\n00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:24.270\nyou're on a business trip.\n\n322\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.340\nI know that I've gotten stuck in\nthe airport before waiting for\n\n323\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.630\na connecting flight.\n\n324\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.230\nWell I need to get to my information.\n\n325\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.410\nYeah, sure, I've got my cellphone but\nif I need a little bit more functionality,\n\n326\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.100\nI also have one of these tablets.\n\n327\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.490\nNow, I say functionality, let me be\nhonest here about the smartphones.\n\n328\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.880\nI know they've got plenty\nof functionality, but\n\n329\n00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.370\nthese give me a greater viewing surface.\n\n330\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.750\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat make these, for\n\n331\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.010\nsome people, a little bit better than\nconstantly using their cellphone.\n\n332\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.160\nIs the fact that you get a little\nbit more screen real estate here.\n\n333\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.510\nAnd you can also get things like, for\n\n334\n00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.990\ninstance, in some of these tablets\nyou get full blown applications.\n\n335\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.331\nAnd the applications, software if you\nwill, that allows us to work with\n\n336\n00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:07.028\ninformation really isn't any different\nthan what we would see on a computer or\n\n337\n00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:07.895\na desktop PC.\n\n338\n00:18:07.895 --> 00:18:10.762\nAnd now what you're working with\nis a familiar environment and\n\n339\n00:18:10.762 --> 00:18:14.020\nthat's another way that these kinda\ncan benefit over the cellphones.\n\n340\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.070\nBecause the cellphones typically\nhave mobile versions of whatever\n\n341\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.150\nthe software is.\n\n342\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.030\nAnd if I was the one launched up,\nlet's say Word here, what I'm gonna end up\n\n343\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.450\nseeing is that this isn't like a mobile\nversion of Word, if it'll launch there.\n\n344\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.420\nNotice that it's the full blown\nOffice application, right?\n\n345\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.410\nAnd this really isn't about Word or\napplications in general but\n\n346\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.370\nif I'm on a cellphone, I might get\na stripped down version of this.\n\n347\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.870\nOr right, like a mobile version that\nhas a reduced functionality set\n\n348\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.180\nversus what would be here on the tablet.\n\n349\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.040\nSo the tablet kind of bridges\nthat gap there, if you will,\n\n350\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.850\nbetween what we would see on our cellphone\nand what we would see on our desktop.\n\n351\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.965\nGives us the ability to maintain that\nfunctionality in a familiar environment so\n\n352\n00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:04.595\nthat you can seamlessly, if you need to,\n\n353\n00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:07.396\nmove from maybe your\ncubicle at the office.\n\n354\n00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:12.087\nYou're working on you desktop, you decide,\nyou know what, I need to turn around,\n\n355\n00:19:12.087 --> 00:19:15.393\nI need to continue working on\nthose marketing figures, but\n\n356\n00:19:15.393 --> 00:19:17.830\nwe're going to a 3PM presentation.\n\n357\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.120\nI've got a deadline, whatever it maybe,\nwell now I'm still working in that\n\n358\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.010\nsame type of application\nthat was on my desktop.\n\n359\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.700\nAnd I don't have to worry\nabout sitting there and,\n\n360\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.660\nlike Wes does with his fat fingers,\nfat fingering the keyboard.\n\n361\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.620\nHe can't actually work with the device.\n\n362\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.200\nSo the tablets really do have their place.\n\n363\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.420\nSome of the major ones out there,\n\n364\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.700\nthis just happens to be\nthe Windows Surface tablet.\n\n365\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.540\nOne of the ones that kinda revolutionized\nthe industry was the iPad, right?\n\n366\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.320\nThe iPad pretty much shattered\nthe world when it came to,\n\n367\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.820\nwhen it was first introduced, right?\n\n368\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.390\nAnd then we have things like your\nAndroid devices, your Android tablets,\n\n369\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.750\nthey follow suit as well.\n\n370\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.920\nAnd then you finally have\nthe Windows Surface tablet.\n\n371\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.410\nSo those are three of the common\ntablets that you'll see out there.\n\n372\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.694\nAnd again, just keep in mind that they\nhave their place just like a cellphone has\n\n373\n00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:03.194\nits place.\n\n374\n00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:05.946\nBut it's kinda like that bridge gap,\nif you will,\n\n375\n00:20:05.946 --> 00:20:10.490\nbetween the full blown desktop computing\nexperience and something that's a little\n\n376\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.210\nbit smaller like your mobile device and\nsuch as a cellphone.\n\n377\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.419\nThe other one, I mean,\nin fact we can show you here,\n\n378\n00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:17.988\nwe also have another one right here.\n\n379\n00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:21.170\nAnd this one just happens to be,\nif we can get it in the screen there.\n\n380\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.288\nThis just happens to be\nan ASUS Android tablet.\n\n381\n00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:28.211\nSo you could see, same functionality, even\nlooks pretty close to the same phone and\n\n382\n00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:30.825\nthe locked pin that you would\nhave to type in, in order.\n\n383\n00:20:30.825 --> 00:20:32.805\nAnd again, it is touch interface so\n\n384\n00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:36.720\nyou can see basically working\nwith it without a keyboard.\n\n385\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.580\nThe other cool thing about these\ndevices is maybe you do want that\n\n386\n00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.750\nfunctionality, right.\n\n387\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.830\nMaybe you want the functionality of\nbeing able to add something like\n\n388\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.750\na keyboard to this.\n\n389\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.143\nWell, one of the great things is,\nthese things do have detachable keyboards.\n\n390\n00:20:49.143 --> 00:20:52.690\nAnd if I need a keyboard, it's basically\njust a, thank you there, Ronnie,\n\n391\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.690\nit's basically just a simple\naccessory that you can add.\n\n392\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.420\nAnd now, like I said, really bridging\nthat gap between the desktop computing\n\n393\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.280\nexperience and, very good too,\nit snapped right in, and the cellphone.\n\n394\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.930\nNow, if I need that full QWERTY keyboard,\nright,\n\n395\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.480\nI have the ability to be\neven more productive.\n\n396\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.050\nAnd if I'm sitting down at that\npresentation like I was telling you that's\n\n397\n00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.510\nat 3 PM there,\nI could still be typing out.\n\n398\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.570\nHopefully, not getting in trouble and\n\n399\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.600\nignoring whoever the presenter is but\nRonnie, there we go.\n\n400\n00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.470\nWhen it comes down to it,\nwe've got those tablets as well.\n\n401\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.150\nThey help us out tremendously when it\ncomes to maintaining productivity.\n\n402\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.010\nNow, what are some of\nthe characteristics of the tablets?\n\n403\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.000\nUsually the processors in them, right,\nthe processor, we call them the CPU,\n\n404\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.920\nthat's the brains behind\nthe whole operation.\n\n405\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.920\nThey're typically low powered, right, and\nreduced heat, it's one of the benefits.\n\n406\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.330\nThe mobility, one of the things we have to\nworry about with mobility is the fact that\n\n407\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.097\nthey can get very hot, they can overheat.\n\n408\n00:21:48.097 --> 00:21:53.589\nSo one of the things they design\nthem to do is to be less heat and\n\n409\n00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:57.050\nrun a little bit cooler, basically.\n\n410\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.040\nSometimes they can have less\nprocessing power than your desktops but\n\n411\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.850\nthat line has been drawn and\nblurred a lot in modern technology,\n\n412\n00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.150\nthat some of them can\nalso be very powerful.\n\n413\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.690\nNow when we talk about mobility,\n\n414\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.720\nthe other thing that we also need\nto mention is the fact that we\n\n415\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.380\nhave another form factor that I would\nbe aware of, and that is a laptop.\n\n416\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.800\nAll right, and you can see here on\nthe ITProTV set that we are using laptops.\n\n417\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.840\nHere is an older laptop.\n\n418\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.796\nThis is one, and I don't know if this\nis Lenovo or Lenova, yeah it is Lenova.\n\n419\n00:22:30.796 --> 00:22:33.976\nAnd it's [LAUGH] I go back\nto when IBM owned these and\n\n420\n00:22:33.976 --> 00:22:35.956\nthese were the IBM thinkpads.\n\n421\n00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:38.672\nI could see that this is actually\nthe Lenovo or Lenova however,\n\n422\n00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:39.550\nyou might say that.\n\n423\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.450\nNow see, the laptop is another portable\ndevice that was actually around prior to\n\n424\n00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.070\nthe tablets being here, right.\n\n425\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.260\nThe tablet's kinda like\nthe culmination and\n\n426\n00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.960\nblending of the best functionalities\nof a desktop and the laptop combined.\n\n427\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.660\nNow the laptop, if you will,\nthis has got more of the functionality of\n\n428\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.160\nthe traditional desktop, but\nthe portability that you get,\n\n429\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.970\nbeing able to take this pretty much on the\nroad, if you will, take it room to room.\n\n430\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.001\nEven if you're talking about the same\nbuilding, right, floor to floor.\n\n431\n00:23:09.001 --> 00:23:13.452\nAnd again, with these devices\nyou typically have a lower\n\n432\n00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:17.820\nperforming processor for\nreduced power consumption.\n\n433\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.950\nA big thing is the power consumption\nas well as overheating too.\n\n434\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.630\nYou could see that the interface right\nhere is something called a touch pad where\n\n435\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.720\nwe interact just with a touch sensor.\n\n436\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.486\nAnd then your input devices,\nright and left-click.\n\n437\n00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:34.638\nAnd we'll see all of this stuff,\nwe'll talk more about the types of\n\n438\n00:23:34.638 --> 00:23:37.590\ninput devices here, but\nyou got a track point as well.\n\n439\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:42.374\nAnd then you get, again,\nthis is more of the functionality that\n\n440\n00:23:42.374 --> 00:23:45.664\nyou would see inside of\na full size desktop.\n\n441\n00:23:45.664 --> 00:23:49.715\nAll right, so that being said,\nthose are some of the,\n\n442\n00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:55.002\nI would say computing devices that you\nwould see more in a residential or\n\n443\n00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:58.703\nfrom the client aspect,\nthe end-user aspect but\n\n444\n00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:02.958\nThat isn't the only device\ntypes that we have out there.\n\n445\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:05.220\nWe also have what are known as servers.\n\n446\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.021\nNow when we look at servers,\nservers can come in all shapes and sizes.\n\n447\n00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:13.013\nIn fact, Ronnie, to kind of give us an\nidea the slim line case that I was telling\n\n448\n00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:16.582\nyou about, far left side of that\npicture would be a slim line case, but\n\n449\n00:24:16.582 --> 00:24:20.840\ninterestingly enough we wouldn't be doing\njustice if I called that a slim line PC.\n\n450\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.270\nIt is PC design, but\nthat is actually a small server.\n\n451\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:25.980\nBelieve it or not.\n\n452\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.680\nAnd you can see that these\nlook no different than any\n\n453\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.620\ntraditional desktop., right?\n\n454\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.990\nNow to the trained eye, one of the things\nthat might be noticeable is, boy,\n\n455\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.470\nthese things are stacked with\nsome hard drives in them, right?\n\n456\n00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.050\nSo what is the difference between this and\nwhat we were looking at earlier?\n\n457\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.000\nThe mid or even microsized desktop?\n\n458\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.100\nNot really much.\n\n459\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.180\nA computer is a computer.\n\n460\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.230\nThe difference here though is\nthe power behind the computer, right?\n\n461\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.890\nWhen I need to fire up Word,\n\n462\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:59.090\nwhen I need to work with a graphics\npiece of software to modify multimedia,\n\n463\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:03.690\na lot of times I don't need\nan extreme amount of power.\n\n464\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.880\nNow there's always\nan exception to the rule.\n\n465\n00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.430\nThat's not written in stone, for sure.\n\n466\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:14.620\nBut when you need to provide services to\n50 computers, to 100 computers, right?\n\n467\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.610\nWe have resources that these computers\nrely on to do their day to day business.\n\n468\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.430\nInside of an enterprise level environment,\nyou need a little bit more power than\n\n469\n00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:28.010\nthe traditional desktop pc has, and that's\nwhere servers come into play, right?\n\n470\n00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.810\nWell what do we mean\nwhen we say more power?\n\n471\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.790\nWell we're talking about\nmore processing power.\n\n472\n00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:37.070\nWe're not talking about just one\nmassive brain or chip on a motherboard,\n\n473\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.960\non a circuit board in there.\n\n474\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.410\nNow we're talking about the potential\nto have 2, 4, 8, 16, 64 processors.\n\n475\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.400\nAll working together to make one\nmassive calculator, if you will.\n\n476\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.680\nOne massive calculating device.\n\n477\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.910\nThe other thing that we have\ntoo is a lot of system memory.\n\n478\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.630\nWhere again, like I said,\n\n479\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.990\nwe'll talk about this coming up, but\nthey have a lot more components in them.\n\n480\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.030\nAnd it's typically because these\nare in business environments, and\n\n481\n00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.590\nwhat they're doing is helping maintain\nbusiness information based systems.\n\n482\n00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.160\nSo they're more expensive.\n\n483\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.700\nAgain, they do come in different sizes.\n\n484\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.650\nWe also have, here is an example of what's\nknown as a rack mount server, right?\n\n485\n00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.710\nSame concepts guys.\n\n486\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.500\nDon't let the concept fool you.\n\n487\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.570\nJust because the size or\nthe shape of this device changed.\n\n488\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.990\nIt's just because now we can put\nthese in individual racks and\n\n489\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.410\nthey're easier to maintain that way.\n\n490\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.810\nWe can collect them that way.\n\n491\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:38.640\nWe can put them in specially\ndesigned rooms that make sure\n\n492\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.920\nthe temperature doesn't overheat, and\nmake sure we don't get dust in there.\n\n493\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.120\nSo these are called\nthe rack mount servers, and\n\n494\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.660\nthey also have their place too.\n\n495\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.950\nNow there's a couple of other types of\ndevices that are out there, and, again,\n\n496\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.540\nthese are not gonna be residential\nbased devices in your homes.\n\n497\n00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.670\nSometimes you might not even find\nthem in many enterprises cuz\n\n498\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.250\nthey typically cost a lot of money.\n\n499\n00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.980\nAnd these are things like supercomputers,\nright?\n\n500\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.310\nWe have supercomputers.\n\n501\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.160\nYou might have heard of Cray out there.\n\n502\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.820\nIf you haven't, go out and\ntake a look at Cray.\n\n503\n00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.340\nYou can see, now what is this?\n\n504\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.530\nThis is a bunch of devices collectively\nbuilt together in these closet type\n\n505\n00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.730\nboxes, if you will.\n\n506\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.270\nAnd all of these individual pieces\ncollectively make up what we know\n\n507\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.830\nas a supercomputer.\n\n508\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.890\nOne of the first types of\ncomputers was the mainframe.\n\n509\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.748\nAnd it's kind of hard to see here,\nbut we have a mainframe computer, IBM,\n\n510\n00:27:31.748 --> 00:27:33.660\nInternational Business Machines.\n\n511\n00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.170\nThese are big machines,\nand what they do is,\n\n512\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:41.420\nthey don't compute information just for,\nlet's say a user like Ronnie and myself.\n\n513\n00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.980\nWhat they do is,\nthey compute information for hundreds,\n\n514\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.490\nthousands, of different\nend users potentially.\n\n515\n00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.980\nMapping out things like\nthe human circulatory system,\n\n516\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.810\nweather patterns, calculating big data.\n\n517\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.920\nSo they also have their place\ninside of the computing industry.\n\n518\n00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.980\n>> So what we're taking a look at here,\nright, when we start to see the idea\n\n519\n00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.910\nof what Wes is presenting When you\nstart talking about desktops and\n\n520\n00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.250\nthe mobile types of devices that we're\ntalking, about such as laptops and\n\n521\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:18.720\nthese tablets, it is directly for, really,\none person to interact with that computer.\n\n522\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.220\nIn other words, an end user's always at\nthe end of the input of those devices.\n\n523\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.320\nAnd then that computer\ngenerates some output, and\n\n524\n00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.950\nthat output comes directly to whoever's\nsitting behind that computer.\n\n525\n00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.660\nAnd so that's what we normally see when\nwe talk about the mobile devices, or\n\n526\n00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.630\nthe regular desktops.\n\n527\n00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.760\nWhen we start moving into the other\ntypes of machines we are talking about,\n\n528\n00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.610\nthis is different in\na couple of senses here.\n\n529\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.100\nThe server that Wes was talking about, and\n\n530\n00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:50.040\nyou might also hear a term like daemon as\nwell, those have special meanings to it.\n\n531\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.970\n>> The server is not different in terms\nof the types of components that you'll\n\n532\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.840\nsee in them in a regular desktop.\n\n533\n00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.520\nThey are higher performance.\n\n534\n00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.960\nThere is a lot more of them\nto actually do a lot more.\n\n535\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.420\nBut the difference is\nthe nature in what they do.\n\n536\n00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.206\nThey are not designed for\nan individual end user to sit down and\n\n537\n00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:11.930\ngo, I need to do this, I need to do this.\n\n538\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.910\nThey're designed to handle the capacity\nof multiple users needing access to\n\n539\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:22.100\nwhatever services that that server\ncan get without human interaction.\n\n540\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.070\nIn other words I don't need to tell it,\nyes, give this file to Wes.\n\n541\n00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.680\nIt, essentially, knows that when Wes\nconnects and a bunch other things that\n\n542\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.990\nare set up in the background,\nif it will give that file to Wes or not.\n\n543\n00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.880\nIf I need to get an email sent,\nI don't have to say, send this email from\n\n544\n00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:44.060\nthis Wes out to, well Ronnie, the server\nitself has software on it that will allow\n\n545\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.060\nme to connect, that will Wes to connect,\nwill allow our entire company to connect.\n\n546\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.510\nAnd it can handle all that email\n\n547\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.880\nWithout needing me to actually\ndo any of the interaction to it.\n\n548\n00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.040\nSo it is designed to be much more powerful\nin that sense when you start talking about\n\n549\n00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.250\nits functionality.\n\n550\n00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.850\nOn a day to day basis,\ncomputer users like you and\n\n551\n00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:06.700\nme, we may never see this server, but\nin the background they're working.\n\n552\n00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.290\nThen you can talk about those\npurpose-build types of computers.\n\n553\n00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.940\nThese super computers that\nWes was talking about,\n\n554\n00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.000\nwhere they are used to actually map entire\ngenomes, the entire genetic sequence of\n\n555\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.980\nthe human being,\nto be able to crunch numbers like that.\n\n556\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.480\nAnd so those particular computers are not\ndesigned for me to run Word on it,\n\n557\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.590\nMicrosoft Word.\n\n558\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.540\nCan I do it?\n\n559\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.870\nProbably, but they're not really\ndesigned for me to do that.\n\n560\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:37.690\nThey are designed to do a whole bunch\nof computing that they need to,\n\n561\n00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.250\nin terms of mathematics to generate\nthe output that they need,\n\n562\n00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.600\nbecause of how insanely large these\ncalculations actually are going to be.\n\n563\n00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.003\nAnd then, of course,\nthe old main frame is designed for\n\n564\n00:30:49.003 --> 00:30:51.750\nmultiple connections into\na centralized device.\n\n565\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:57.040\nAnd, once again, no human interaction is\nreally needed for its day to day working.\n\n566\n00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.770\nThere is, of course, all the input\nwhere the super computers and\n\n567\n00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.450\nthose main frames get a ton of input\nfrom multiple input devices, and\n\n568\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.440\nthen they generate maybe one output or\nmaybe 10,000 outputs.\n\n569\n00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.970\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n570\n00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.390\nBut that's the whole goal and\nidea when we start taking a look.\n\n571\n00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.160\nNow, Wes, there's still one more category\nas we've now moved into the second\n\n572\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.280\ndecade of the 21st century.\n\n573\n00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.710\nWes, what is that last component\nthat we're talking about?\n\n574\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.360\n>> That's right.\n\n575\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.050\nI felt like we should put this\none in here because of how\n\n576\n00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.820\nmuch you find this out there today.\n\n577\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.910\nAnd if you have never heard\nabout this term, it's IOT.\n\n578\n00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.050\nThey call it the Internet of Things.\n\n579\n00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.290\nYou also hear this blended with\nthings like embedded technologies.\n\n580\n00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.741\nI actually got a little\ndemonstration here.\n\n581\n00:31:42.741 --> 00:31:46.263\nI just want you to know as Internet\nof Things just being the fact\n\n582\n00:31:46.263 --> 00:31:51.077\nthat a computing device isn't limited to\nwhat we been talking about the traditional\n\n583\n00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:52.327\ncomputing devices.\n\n584\n00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:56.534\nNow we have the way that we can control\nand you can see Things like health\n\n585\n00:31:56.534 --> 00:32:00.599\nmonitors here, Google Glass,\nexperience based devices as well,\n\n586\n00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:04.160\nenvironmental systems,\ncontrol systems if you will.\n\n587\n00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.457\nThese have embedded chips and\nthey take a programming, if you will,\n\n588\n00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:10.841\na language to be able to control them.\n\n589\n00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:14.920\nBut there are certainly not\nfull blown desktop machines.\n\n590\n00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.450\nThey're not the, they do have their place\nbut their not the same thing as laptops.\n\n591\n00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.830\nAgain, very small, very stripped\ndown devices that allow the end user\n\n592\n00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.730\nthe ability to do things like develop and\ndesign.\n\n593\n00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.460\nThey're very,\n\n594\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.880\nvery common today to provide young\nkids with a way to get into computing.\n\n595\n00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.330\nAnd they typically have a lowered expense.\n\n596\n00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.660\nThat doesn't mean that\nthey can't get expensive.\n\n597\n00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.120\nBut, pretty much,\n\n598\n00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.120\nyou have computing power that can control\njust about any aspect of your life today.\n\n599\n00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.600\nLike I said, health monitoring devices,\nif you will, embedded in your cars.\n\n600\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.350\nThat's the other thing.\n\n601\n00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.900\nYou have a lot of computing systems\nthat are bedded right in your\n\n602\n00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.520\ncars that are controlling things\nlike machinery and factory.\n\n603\n00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.260\nSo we do have to bring those up.\n\n604\n00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.370\nKeep in mind that term IOT, just Internet\nof Things just means that it's bringing\n\n605\n00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.240\neverything online and connecting\nit to the network so that we can\n\n606\n00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.370\ncontrol various systems throughout\nour day to day goings on in life.\n\n607\n00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.330\n>> There's no doubt that there's a lot of\ndifferent types of hardware that's out\n\n608\n00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.300\nthere for us and available to us.\n\n609\n00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.240\nAnd if we're just entering\ninto the computing world,\n\n610\n00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.200\nit can be a little bit overwhelming.\n\n611\n00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.920\nBut hopefully we've put into context\nof when you're gonna normally encounter\n\n612\n00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.950\nsome of these things.\n\n613\n00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.390\nMore than likely today as\na person getting started,\n\n614\n00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.680\nthe desktop computer's gonna\nbe our day to day environment,\n\n615\n00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.300\nwhether that's gonna be something\nlike a laptop that's mobile or\n\n616\n00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.590\nwhether it's a desktop computer in which\nwe are tethered to that one location.\n\n617\n00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.220\nYou will also encounter the use of\nservers, but in the background.\n\n618\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.420\nIn other words,\nyou don't have to go ahead and do it,\n\n619\n00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.680\nyou'll connect to them through software\nand then the software handle exchange and\n\n620\n00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.988\nthe communication process and\neverything else that we need.\n\n621\n00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:56.320\nAnd at times, you may encounter\na super computer or even a mainframe.\n\n622\n00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.480\nThose are normally purpose built or\n\n623\n00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.700\npurpose driven in terms of\nwhat they end up doing.\n\n624\n00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.020\nAnd, of course, if you are driving\nnow in a relatively a modern vehicle\n\n625\n00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.800\nthat has the backup display,\nthat has the ability to for\n\n626\n00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.430\nyou connect your Bluetooth devices so\nthey can play through your systems,\n\n627\n00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.640\nthat allow you to connect your\ncell phone or your mobile phone,\n\n628\n00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.230\nsmart phone, to be able to connect out and\nalso connect it to network and\n\n629\n00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.230\ndo GPS, that's part of that\ninternet of things option as well.\n\n630\n00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:30.440\nOne day if you don't already have it, even\nyour toaster oven inside of your home,\n\n631\n00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.290\nmay end up with one of these devices,\nthat will help it to connect and control.\n\n632\n00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.300\nAnd that way as Wes is driving home and\nhe wants it to pop a pizza in that toaster\n\n633\n00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.410\noven, he can pop a piece of\npizza in that toaster oven and\n\n634\n00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.480\nhave it begin to warm and then he walks\nthrough the door and there it is.\n\n635\n00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.380\nIt is nice and ready for him to go.\n\n636\n00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.870\nSo just kind of realize you are gonna\nencounter this type of technology.\n\n637\n00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.590\nJust being familiar with the idea is\nactually gonna be part of the benefit that\n\n638\n00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.520\nyou'll understand as you continue to\nwork more and more with these devices.\n\n639\n00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.760\nWes, any last words?\n\n640\n00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.310\n>> No, I pretty much think you go it.\n\n641\n00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.580\nThat's what I was gonna say is\nthat the desktops, laptops,\n\n642\n00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.790\ntablets, those are really gonna be\nthe ones that you're gonna focus on.\n\n643\n00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.610\nWe just mentioned some of the other\nones in the background for\n\n644\n00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.530\nthe sake of completion.\n\n645\n00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.700\nSo that if you do get in an environment\nwhere maybe they are using one of those\n\n646\n00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.640\npurpose driven servers,\nyou're not like, my gosh, what is this?\n\n647\n00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.380\nIt’s just a computer that has\na different purpose, if you will, and\n\n648\n00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.750\nmore power but definitely pay attention\nto the desktops, the laptops, and\n\n649\n00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.090\nthe tablets because you only going\nto see more and more of them.\n\n650\n00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.500\n>> All right well that's a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode then.\n\n651\n00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.870\nSigning off for

here in ITPro.Tv.\n\n4\n00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.930\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.310\nyou're watching the IC3 Computing\nFundamental Show where we're about to dive\n\n6\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.340\ninto the hardware that we find\ninside of a computer system.\n\n7\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.080\nAnd we have our hardware expert\nwith us today, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.230\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.140\n>> Thanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.700\nThat's right, we're going to be\ntalking about hardware today.\n\n11\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.090\nAnd to start us off here, we're going\nto talk a little bit about platform,\n\n12\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.450\nif you will, and compatibility,\nbecause it is important to understand\n\n13\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.720\nbefore you even attempt to start\nworking on your devices here,\n\n14\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.150\nyou really have to know what\nkind of platform you have.\n\n15\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.250\nSo I wanna take a little\nbit of time here and\n\n16\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.460\njust talk about the two main platform\ntypes that we have out there and\n\n17\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.640\nthat is the IBM slash Intel base that we\ntypically call a PC, you might have heard\n\n18\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.660\nit called PC market and just real\nbriefly wanna mention Macintosh as well.\n\n19\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.430\nWe're gonna be focusing in on the PC\nside of things but we do wanna mention\n\n20\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.020\nboth of those platforms because we\nwouldn't really be doing you any justice\n\n21\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.720\nif we just mention PC so we do wanna\nmention out there that the Macintosh\n\n22\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.650\nplatform has been around there\njust about as long as PC has been.\n\n23\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.960\nIn fact, they've both been around\nabout the same amount of time.\n\n24\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.310\nPrimarily though, when we talk about\nIntel base, we talk about PC based,\n\n25\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.390\nwhat we're really looking at when\nwe start to build a machine,\n\n26\n00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.190\nthere's another component that we've\ngot to consider and that really is\n\n27\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.570\nwhether your system is 32-bit or\nwhether it's 64-bit.\n\n28\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.730\nAnd what this means for\n\n29\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.180\nus really is just the amount of\ninformation that the processor can chew.\n\n30\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.030\nNow the processor we'll get to in a bit,\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.640\nmention a couple of terms here and\n\n32\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.270\nI'll try to set the stage before we\nactually show you what the processor is.\n\n33\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.570\nJust for now if you will, think of it\nas the brains of the entire operation.\n\n34\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.238\nIt what does all the arithmetic and\nthe calculations if you will.\n\n35\n00:02:03.238 --> 00:02:08.430\nAnd the 32-bit if you will,\nthere's 32 bits\n\n36\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.010\nof information that gets shoved in to\nthe CPU for it to calculate, all right.\n\n37\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.385\nSo these 32 bit chunks if you will.\n\n38\n00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:19.990\n64-bit doubles the width of that\namount of that information,\n\n39\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.580\nand there's 64 bits that can be\nchewed off at a single time.\n\n40\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.400\nNow when we say this, please understand\nthat when we say 32 bits it doesn't take\n\n41\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.060\nlong to calculate that information\nbecause our modern CPUs can do\n\n42\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.220\nbillions of calculations in a second, so\nthink about it as eating a whole bunch\n\n43\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.410\nof food really quick and you guys can\nprobably see I can eat some food here.\n\n44\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.310\nIf I can eat more food than\nthe person next to me that would\n\n45\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.850\nbe kind of the comparison, if you will,\nfrom the 32-bit to the 64-bit system.\n\n46\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.700\nAnd you might say well why wouldn't\nI just get a 64-bit system?\n\n47\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.950\nWell, that's up to you.\n\n48\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.815\nAnd again it does It really hinges on what\ndo you actually need in your systems.\n\n49\n00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:07.770\n32-bit still has it's benefit inside\nof things like smaller systems, smaller\n\n50\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.600\nnotebooks, if you will, that don't need\na lot of processing power if you will.\n\n51\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.030\nJust really basic devices.\n\n52\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.980\nBut the main thing we really look\nat when we look at 32-bit and\n\n53\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.730\nwe look at 64-bit is the amount\nof something known as memory.\n\n54\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.970\nAnd again,\nwe're gonna talk more about memory.\n\n55\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.620\nAgain, let me kinda set the stage for\nthat so as I mention these terms,\n\n56\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.810\nit doesn't sound foreign to you.\n\n57\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.650\nI just want you to think about as memory\nas a temporary place that we put data\n\n58\n00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.950\nbefore or\nafter the CPU needs to work with it.\n\n59\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.105\nSo the amount of that memory,\nthat staging area where we can store\n\n60\n00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:47.778\ndata temporarily for the CPU to work with\nit, the amount of memory is limited.\n\n61\n00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:54.100\nIn a 32-bit system, we have a maximum of\nwhat's known as 4GB of system memory.\n\n62\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.720\nNow in the 64-bit, theoretically\nthere is a limit, but I don't think\n\n63\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.280\nthat we're gonna see a system with\nthe upper limit of that memory.\n\n64\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.860\nIt's just a massive amount of memory,\nwe don't have systems\n\n65\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.660\nright now that really support that\namount of memory in a system,\n\n66\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.925\nso we want you to know that\ngoing out the gate first.\n\n67\n00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:20.440\nKnow that 32-bit versus 64-bit is really\ngoing to dictate what kind of pieces,\n\n68\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.648\nwhat kind of motherboard you're gonna\nget and then ultimately what we're gonna\n\n69\n00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:30.952\nlead up to what you're gonna talk about is\nthe software that you run on the system.\n\n70\n00:04:30.952 --> 00:04:33.698\nSo it is important before\nyou start any kind of build,\n\n71\n00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:37.909\nbefore you start working on the computers\nis knowing what the platform is that your\n\n72\n00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.998\nsupporting so that you can make sure that\nyou get the right components if you ever\n\n73\n00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.134\nneed to replace anything,\nif you need to service anything.\n\n74\n00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:50.634\nAnd nobody would wanna have to spend money\non a whole bunch of that system memory and\n\n75\n00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:55.830\nthen realize that when you put it in\nthe system you're only seeing four gigs.\n\n76\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.880\nYou might be wasting your money,\nso those are good things to know.\n\n77\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.590\nThe other one I might just briefly mention\nhere is ARM, ARM based processors if you\n\n78\n00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.580\nwill, because of how many\nmobile devices are out there.\n\n79\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.800\nOkay, this is not something you're\ngonna find in one of your desktop PCs.\n\n80\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.170\nIt's typically something you're\ngonna find in a cell phone.\n\n81\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.090\nIt's something you're\ngonna find in a tablet.\n\n82\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.150\nAnd I just wanna mention them here,\n\n83\n00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.710\nbecause it's the other architecture that's\nout there and it's important to know that.\n\n84\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.450\nAgain, you're not gonna find these inside\nof these bigger systems like that.\n\n85\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.340\nThey're low powered, they're low heat, and\n\n86\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.080\nthey're typically in\nthings like cell phones.\n\n87\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.780\nAnd it does lend itself to mentioning it.\n\n88\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.920\nNow the other thing I'll tell\nyou that you have to know,\n\n89\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.750\nI mentioned briefly about compatibility.\n\n90\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.450\nI mentioned the chipset, all right, well,\n\n91\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.730\nthere's other things that are involved\nwith that chipset, and drivers.\n\n92\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.110\nNow, what is a driver,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n93\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.590\nAre we talking about something\nout there on a golf course that\n\n94\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.570\nwe hit a golf ball 300 yards?\n\n95\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.680\nNot really, what we're talking\nabout is a piece of software.\n\n96\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.930\nAnd I know we haven't gotten into software\nyet but this is a very important piece of\n\n97\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.090\nsoftware that really dictates whether\nyou can use your hardware at all.\n\n98\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.180\nAnd that is basically a component within\nthe operating system that takes a language\n\n99\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.480\nthat our operating system is written in,\nthe software that runs the machine, right.\n\n100\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.500\nWell it can't run the machine because\nit's speaking a foreign language\n\n101\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.410\nas opposed to what our\nhardware is speaking, right?\n\n102\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.060\nOur hardware speaks a completely different\nmachine dependent type of lingo, right?\n\n103\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.890\nAnd if we want these two to interact,\nwe want them to communicate,\n\n104\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.860\nwell we've got to put like a translator,\nright in the middle of it, right?\n\n105\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.290\nIf I don't speak Spanish and\nI wanna have a conversation with somebody\n\n106\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.990\nthat speaks Spanish, well I would love\nto know Spanish but I don't speak it.\n\n107\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.850\nI would have to get a translator, right?\n\n108\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.920\nIf you take the translator out then we're\nnot really making much sense between\n\n109\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.170\nthe conversation and likewise somebody\ntalking back to me trying to understand\n\n110\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.400\nthe English that I'm speaking and it's\njust gonna sound like nothing to them.\n\n111\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.330\nYou put the translator in the way, right,\nand now you've got communication and\n\n112\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.740\nthat's what the driver does, so it's\nimportant getting back to 32 and 64 bit,\n\n113\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.160\nyou'll see that it all hinges\non those decisions that you make\n\n114\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.720\nwhen you first get your computer or when\nyou're buying, repairing or building one.\n\n115\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.180\nSo 32-bit drivers go with 32-bit systems.\n\n116\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.640\n64-bit drivers go with 64-bit systems.\n\n117\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.450\nLet's go ahead and step back.\n\n118\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.280\nRemember, those drivers,\n32-bit translators, if you will,\n\n119\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.050\nallow the operating system,\non a 32-bit machine,\n\n120\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.050\nto talk to the hardware on the 32-bit\nmachine, and likewise with 64-bit.\n\n121\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.920\nNow, I also mentioned a component\ncalled the chipset right?\n\n122\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.700\nWell, that has to do with another\ncomponent, that we're gonna talk about,\n\n123\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.950\ncoming up known as a motherboard,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.040\nAnd it is what really\nhandles a lot of the majority\n\n125\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.190\nof the communication between the operating\nsystem and its drivers and the hardware.\n\n126\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.100\nLet me go ahead and show you.\n\n127\n00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.756\nI pulled up a web site.\n\n128\n00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:57.461\nThere's only really two chipsets that\nwe have to worry about in today's\n\n129\n00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.137\nday and age.\n\n130\n00:07:58.137 --> 00:07:59.609\nAnd, I'm up on Intel's site.\n\n131\n00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:04.892\nI know it's kind of hard to see here; but,\nthis is actually Intel chipset software\n\n132\n00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:09.890\ninstallation makes it very easy if you're\nnot sure you know have Intel board.\n\n133\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.530\nYou find out the specifications\nof your system unit and\n\n134\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.420\nyou say okay, you know it's Intel,\nI need this chipset drivers.\n\n135\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.930\nNow what does that mean, all right?\n\n136\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.570\nIn your system there is a crucial\ncollection of these little,\n\n137\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.580\nlittle computing chips that really\ngovern all the traffic that goes\n\n138\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.970\nacross this motherboard and\nallows the communication there.\n\n139\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.530\nSo we need to make sure that\nthe chipset is right as well.\n\n140\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.910\nThat we have those drivers present.\n\n141\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.050\nThe other one is AMD and\nI mentioned I've got AMD's pulled up here.\n\n142\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.680\nNotice, those are the two big competitors.\n\n143\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.880\nAnd you'll see a lot of this stuff\nall intertwines together, right?\n\n144\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.815\nWe talk about 32 bit and 64 bit,\nwe talk about Intel-based platforms,\n\n145\n00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:52.905\nright, we talk about Macintosh.\n\n146\n00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:57.295\nWe need to make sure that we understand\nthat when you are supporting a system,\n\n147\n00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:00.932\nyou know whether you have an Intel-based\nsystem or you have an AMD-based system.\n\n148\n00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:06.197\nAll right, and I've showed you a little\nbit of the manufacturer's websites here.\n\n149\n00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:07.985\nRemember that if you're not sure,\n\n150\n00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:12.290\nyou can always look up your information\nfrom manufacturer's websites.\n\n151\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.170\nNow, that talks a little bit\nabout the platform itself,\n\n152\n00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.720\nbut the next thing I'd like to show you is\nsomething known as the system unit, right?\n\n153\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.390\nAs we start to dive into\nthe components that we use,\n\n154\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.850\nwe have to know a little\nbit about those components.\n\n155\n00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.550\nIn order to not only understand\nthem in general, but\n\n156\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.660\nalso to help support them and\nhelp to repair them if necessary.\n\n157\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.169\nNow, I'm actually,\nRonnie, I've got a case.\n\n158\n00:09:36.169 --> 00:09:38.807\nThe first thing that we talked\nabout in a system unit, well,\n\n159\n00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:40.640\nlet me step back for a second.\n\n160\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.540\nWhat do we mean when we say system unit?\n\n161\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.420\nWell, when you look in a desktop, right?\n\n162\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.580\nYou see that little tower,\n\n163\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.740\nthat little box, well, that box\nisn't the only thing that's there.\n\n164\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.440\nIt is essentially holding together a bunch\nof components that are working in tandem.\n\n165\n00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.300\nWorking together to ensure that you have\nsome kind of computing experience, right?\n\n166\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.430\nAnd what holds and\n\n167\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.140\nbrings all of the components together\nin any system is the tower, right?\n\n168\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.030\nNow you will hear many different terms,\nI know that Ronnie and I,\n\n169\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.100\nwe use them interchangeably.\n\n170\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.930\nWe might say computer case,\nwe might say computer tower.\n\n171\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.796\nYou might even hear some people\ncall it a chassis, all right?\n\n172\n00:10:16.796 --> 00:10:19.280\nBut those are the common ones,\ncomputer tower, computer case.\n\n173\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.690\nIn fact, we've got one right here if we\ncan go ahead and take a look at that one.\n\n174\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.590\nAnd there's nothing really\ntoo special about it, right?\n\n175\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.190\nSo if I kind of zoom out here, you can\nsee if I lift up the front of this.\n\n176\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.330\nWell, this is a computer case right?\n\n177\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.180\nYou can see that we don't have\nanything in this at all and\n\n178\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.965\nit is really nothing more\nthan a metal box, right?\n\n179\n00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:43.560\nIt's a metal box that brings all\nof these components together.\n\n180\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.028\nNow if I go ahead and\nturn this back on its side,\n\n181\n00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:52.240\nnotice that we've got different\nhousings in here, right?\n\n182\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.240\nIf we get in here a little bit,\none of the things that we can see up here.\n\n183\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.740\nWell, down here I should say,\n\n184\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.638\nis we can see things like where\nour optical drives would go.\n\n185\n00:11:00.638 --> 00:11:04.695\nExtra storage bays for our hard drives.\n\n186\n00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.825\nThen on here we also have hard drive\nbase and this is one of the things that\n\n187\n00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:10.765\nholds where our storage,\nwhere we store that information, right.\n\n188\n00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:13.705\nIt's so important, that's the whole\nreason we're in computing anyway,\n\n189\n00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:16.335\nwe need to deal with data,\nwhere is the data gets stored.\n\n190\n00:11:16.335 --> 00:11:20.835\nInside the case you could see right here,\nthis is where the housing is for\n\n191\n00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:21.620\nour hard drives.\n\n192\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.970\nNow, if any of these components\ndon't make sense yet\n\n193\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.940\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout them, so just bear with me here.\n\n194\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.575\nNotice that we also have mounting points,\nright, for the motherboard.\n\n195\n00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:37.257\nNow here's what's important in any\nsystem unit you have whats known as form\n\n196\n00:11:37.257 --> 00:11:38.290\nfactor, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.385\nNow form factor sounds\nlike this technical term,\n\n198\n00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:45.200\nit's not really that technical, all right.\n\n199\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.415\nA form factor just means the size,\nthe shape and\n\n200\n00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:52.905\nin certain aspects,\ncharacteristics of the device.\n\n201\n00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:56.445\nFor instance, when we talk about our\nhard drives, right, our form factor.\n\n202\n00:11:56.445 --> 00:12:00.115\nWe say typical hard drives,\nour storage device here,\n\n203\n00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:05.102\nis going to be a 3.5 inch hard drive,\nthat's its form factor.\n\n204\n00:12:05.102 --> 00:12:07.352\nAll right, well, what does that mean?\n\n205\n00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:13.542\nIn this aspect, what that means is\nthat it is 3.5 inches across, right?\n\n206\n00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:16.742\nBut that's typically all\nthat form factor means.\n\n207\n00:12:16.742 --> 00:12:21.070\nWith motherboards and case,\nit's a little bit different, right?\n\n208\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.590\nWhen you say a form factor,\nnot only does that talk about the size\n\n209\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.750\nof whatever it is, in this case,\nthe tower but also its arrangements.\n\n210\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.640\nCertain components arrangements\ninside of the case and\n\n211\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.460\nhow they relate to one another.\n\n212\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.490\nSo it is important to understand that\nif you are supporting a machine,\n\n213\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.590\nwhether you're replacing,\nbuilding a machine from scratch.\n\n214\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.020\nThat there are a couple of form factors\nthat always have to match in order\n\n215\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.360\nto build or service a computer, right?\n\n216\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.150\nIt starts here with the case, the chassis\nif you will or the tower, so it's very,\n\n217\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.010\nvery important.\n\n218\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.930\nNow, on the backside of the case\nif I lift this up here,\n\n219\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.150\nyou can see that it’s got some areas for\n\n220\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.160\nthe motherboard and what we'll talk about,\nsome connection interfaces in the ports.\n\n221\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.420\nNow, here's where the form\nfactor comes into play again.\n\n222\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.050\nIf you are following the form factor,\n\n223\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.160\nthe motherboard is one of\nthe things that also has to match.\n\n224\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.920\nAnd this area right here, all right.\n\n225\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.640\nIn these type of cases,\nit's always in the same spot, right?\n\n226\n00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.580\nAnd why is that?\n\n227\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.500\nWell, we need consistency and that's\none of the things that form factors do.\n\n228\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.070\nIt's a standardization or a consistency\nthat says, if Ronnie says Wes,\n\n229\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.270\ntomorrow I need you to buy such and\nsuch form factor case.\n\n230\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.320\nHe knows that if he's got a motherboard\nthat he needs to put into that case.\n\n231\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.600\nAll I have to do is deliver\nhim the case itself and\n\n232\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.840\nhe really doesn't have to check it.\n\n233\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.810\nHe knows that it's consistent,\nthe form factor is a standardization and\n\n234\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.500\nthat motherboard's gonna fit.\n\n235\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.480\nYou can also see that we have\nsome blanking plates back here.\n\n236\n00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.690\nNow what do those do?\n\n237\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.940\nThey're basically when you want to expand\nthe functionality of your computer,\n\n238\n00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.460\nyou add more components to it.\n\n239\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.100\nWell, if the components\naren't in there at first,\n\n240\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.130\nthey've got these little covers here.\n\n241\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.400\nAs you add expandability or\nfunctionality, you can take this off and\n\n242\n00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.940\nyou can add those cartridge.\n\n243\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.255\nYou can also see up here is where our\npower supply goes, we got some various\n\n244\n00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:20.168\ncomponents here that I just decided\nnot to take off of the machine.\n\n245\n00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:25.460\nSo that essentially is our system or\nour case, right?\n\n246\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.930\nUnderstand that there's different types\nwe've talked about in previous episodes.\n\n247\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.260\nWe've got full size, this happens to be\nprobably more of a mid size/micro size,\n\n248\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.650\nit's kind of in the middle.\n\n249\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.200\nYou have the micro case and\nthen you have the slimline case.\n\n250\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.860\nSo again,\nkeep in mind form factor is important.\n\n251\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.320\nAll right, so\nthat is a little bit about the case.\n\n252\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.670\nNow the next component since we're\ntalking about form factors, Ronnie,\n\n253\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.570\nI think what we'll do is we'll\nkeep going along that line here.\n\n254\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.554\nAnd then the next thing that we're\ngonna look at are power supplies.\n\n255\n00:14:56.554 --> 00:14:58.831\nSo, when it comes to a power supply,\n\n256\n00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:03.180\nthis is another thing that needs to\nmatch the form factor of the case.\n\n257\n00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.210\nIn order to be able to fit in it and\nprovide the right power for\n\n258\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.580\nthe components that you're\ngonna put in the machine.\n\n259\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.920\nSo we got our power supply ready.\n\n260\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.490\nLet's go ahead and let's switch over and\nwe'll check this out.\n\n261\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.990\nNow, the power supply doesn't really\nlook like anything fascinating.\n\n262\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.570\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n263\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.890\nIt just looks like a box here.\n\n264\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.380\nBut this thing, I'll tell you, so\n\n265\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.650\nmany of the components, every\ncomponent is important in the system.\n\n266\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.840\nA very important component.\n\n267\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.250\nYou have no power, doesn't matter\nhow awesome your machine is.\n\n268\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.670\nIt's really not gonna do anything,\nso if you don't have good power.\n\n269\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.440\nSo, power supply again,\n\n270\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.265\nthis is another thing that the form\nfactor has to match and why is that?\n\n271\n00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:43.365\nWell, there are certain\ntypes of these plugs,\n\n272\n00:15:43.365 --> 00:15:47.295\nthese connectors that also\nmatch with form factors.\n\n273\n00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:50.415\nRemember I told you, form factors are not\njust about the shape of something,\n\n274\n00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:52.055\nit's also about the characteristic.\n\n275\n00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:55.256\nThere are times when form factor\nis just about the shape, right?\n\n276\n00:15:55.256 --> 00:15:58.149\nTypically in hard drives, three and\na half inch, two and a half inch.\n\n277\n00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:02.354\nOptical drives, three and a half inch, all\nwe're talking about is how wide they are.\n\n278\n00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:06.394\nWhen we talk about form factor with power\nsupply, one of the things that's very\n\n279\n00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:09.773\nimportant is the power plug itself\nthat goes to the motherboard and\n\n280\n00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:11.123\nwe'll show you that now.\n\n281\n00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:14.050\nThis is just a regular power supply.\n\n282\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.310\nYou can get all different kinds.\n\n283\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.345\nYou can get some that you won't even\nsee the connectors here at all, right?\n\n284\n00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.195\nThis is a fixed connecting system or\n\n285\n00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:24.555\nconnectors if you will, these rails\nas they call them they're fixed.\n\n286\n00:16:24.555 --> 00:16:25.565\nI can't take these out.\n\n287\n00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:28.565\nI take them out and power supply might as\nwell throw it in the garbage it's done.\n\n288\n00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:31.780\nBut you do have what are known\nas modular power supplies.\n\n289\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.890\nGuys, all that means is that\nthe plugs are on the back and\n\n290\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.700\nwhat you need you plug in and\nwhat you don't need, you don't, right?\n\n291\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.550\nSo there's times, and like I said\nwe'll show you one of these plugs,\n\n292\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.040\nyou might not ever use one of these plugs.\n\n293\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.260\nIn fact, one of them is legacy and\nyou really don't use it for much anymore.\n\n294\n00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.060\nSo, on this type of power supply,\nwe just gotta do good cable management and\n\n295\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.850\nmake sure that it's just not dangling down\ninto the computer itself in the system.\n\n296\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.030\nThen you have various other plugs\nthat we'll look at coming up.\n\n297\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.670\nAll right?\nNow,\n\n298\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.340\nit's important to understand\nyour power supply.\n\n299\n00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.770\nThat it has enough wattage to power\nall the components that you have\n\n300\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.320\nin the system.\n\n301\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.340\nSo do your research.\n\n302\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.150\nMake sure that as you add components,\nyou know what the wattages and\n\n303\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:18.260\nmake sure that your wattage typically\nexceeds the amount that you need.\n\n304\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.170\nIf you have more wattage\nthan what you need,\n\n305\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.710\nyour computer can only draw all\nthe wattage that it needs, no more.\n\n306\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.350\nSo it's better to have more,\nif you have just enough or\n\n307\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.530\nless, then you run the chance\nof ruining the system or\n\n308\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.780\nhurting the system cuz\nyou're under-powering it.\n\n309\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.980\nNow the other thing I might mention that\nis characteristic on some of these power\n\n310\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.350\nsupplies, in fact it's interesting.\n\n311\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.150\nThis one got a reset.\n\n312\n00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.260\nThis got a little reset button.\n\n313\n00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.080\nSome of them don't have this anymore.\n\n314\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.550\nBut you might see a little selector\nswitch, sometimes it's red on here.\n\n315\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.440\nAnd all that does of you're were in\nthe states here, so we're using the a 110\n\n316\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.550\nVoltage if you will that comes from\nthe outlet but in Europe, they use 220 so\n\n317\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.915\nif you're in European countries and\nstuff, you're gonna switch that, right?\n\n318\n00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:03.975\nThat's what's known as\na fixed input power supply.\n\n319\n00:18:03.975 --> 00:18:07.726\nAnd all that means is that I'm gonna fix\nthe input on the switch it to what I need\n\n320\n00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:11.595\nand if I move it to, let's say another\ncountry whether using a different type of\n\n321\n00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:14.976\nvoltage, I need to come in here and\nfix that voltage and switch that.\n\n322\n00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:21.810\nIf I don't, I either run the risk of under\npowering or over powering our system here.\n\n323\n00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.092\nNow notice that this one.\n\n324\n00:18:24.765 --> 00:18:26.620\nI don't see that switch anywhere.\n\n325\n00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.660\nWhy is that?\n\n326\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.050\nWell, as the technology advanced,\n\n327\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.320\nthey had what are known as\nauto-switching power supplies and\n\n328\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.090\nthey can detect the voltage that you're\non and they'll handle that for you.\n\n329\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.900\nYou might even see an actual\npower button here.\n\n330\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.030\nWe've had for a long time our, remember\nthe software we were talking about that\n\n331\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.660\noperating system that\ncontrols our hardware.\n\n332\n00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.180\nIt's able to control the power there.\n\n333\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.460\nSo you might not see an on\noff switch on these.\n\n334\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.780\nAnd if you don't, that's okay,\nit's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n335\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.520\nSo that is our power supply.\n\n336\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.070\nNow I do have a couple of\nthe connectors that I want to show you,\n\n337\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.590\nmake it a little bit easier for\nyou to see what we're talking about.\n\n338\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.030\nSpecially when it comes to form factor.\n\n339\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.620\nOne of the biggest things in form factor\nof the power supply, not only size,\n\n340\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.400\nis that power connector that is the main\npower connector as they call it.\n\n341\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.010\nNow, what does that mean\nby main power connector?\n\n342\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.350\nIt's what you're going to plug\ndirectly into the motherboard.\n\n343\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.710\nIt gives all the power, if you will,\nthe juice, to the motherboard.\n\n344\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.810\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what am talking about here.\n\n345\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.780\nThis is actually got three different\ntypes of standards all built into one,\n\n346\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.870\nin earliest days,\nwe just need this one pin here and\n\n347\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.170\nyou would just see that little,\nthat 20 Pin connector.\n\n348\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.100\nBut as the motherboards or the requirement\nfor more power came we got,\n\n349\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.610\nstronger devices, well this little\n20 pin it just wouldn't do its job.\n\n350\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.660\nSo what they did is they\nadded four extra pins.\n\n351\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.540\nNow originally this would be\nadditional power for the CPU.\n\n352\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.880\nThose processors, the brains of\nthe operation started to get stronger and\n\n353\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.410\nthey started to need their own power,\nas well.\n\n354\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.520\nSo they added those.\n\n355\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.640\nNow, today what you have\nis this system where And\n\n356\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.390\nthat's what this one is that's down here.\n\n357\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.590\nThe one that's down here is a 24 pin.\n\n358\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.330\nNow, that 24 pin is commonly\nwhat you're gonna see today.\n\n359\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.810\nThat's the standard today.\n\n360\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.699\nIt's the main connector that\npowers the motherboard itself.\n\n361\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.490\nNow couple of other connectors,\n\n362\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.630\nin fact this is the female version here,\nthis is called a molex connector.\n\n363\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.220\nNow this connector can be used for\nmany different things.\n\n364\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.330\nIn the earlier days, it was used for\nsome of the earlier hard drives.\n\n365\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.760\nEarlier hard drives stands as a power\nsupply connector if you will.\n\n366\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.870\nToday, with the older hard drive system,\n\n367\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.520\nthat we're not really using too much any\nmore, you might still see it out there.\n\n368\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.710\nIt isn't much of a necessity for that.\n\n369\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.960\nHowever, what you can do is you can take,\nwe need cooling in our systems, right?\n\n370\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.635\nTo make sure that they don't overheat.\n\n371\n00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:55.085\nWell because of that,\n\n372\n00:20:55.085 --> 00:21:01.085\nyou can use that connector on this\npower supply for system fans.\n\n373\n00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:04.115\nSo keep in mind, this is the Molex\nconnector, a little four pin connector\n\n374\n00:21:04.115 --> 00:21:06.659\nthat you can use,\ntypically today with your system fans.\n\n375\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.440\nNow, remember how I told I said that\nsome of these power supplies don't or\n\n376\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.800\nit'll have a connector that\nyou might use any more.\n\n377\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.620\nThis remember always reminds me\nof like the old space invaders or\n\n378\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.040\nsomething like that.\n\n379\n00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.340\nThis little four pin connector\nis called a bird connector.\n\n380\n00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.810\nThat is for your floppy disks.\n\n381\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.460\nI know some of you out there maybe\nyou still see floppies,,but for\n\n382\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.770\nmost part this is considered more\nof a legacy connector in general.\n\n383\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.300\nAgain, not to say that you couldn't see it\nout there but we do put it here because\n\n384\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.550\nyou can still see your power supplies\nthat they have those on them.\n\n385\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.560\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of some of the connectors.\n\n386\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.810\nWe do have one other that I'll save for\nthe hard drives themselves, and\n\n387\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:53.530\nthat is the serial ATA,\nanother hard drive technology.\n\n388\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.250\nBut, it does look like Ronnie's got\nsomething that he wants to throw in there.\n\n389\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.110\nRonnie, what you got sir?\n\n390\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.020\n>> Well, when we start taking\na look at a power supply,\n\n391\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.290\nalso a key thing that we wanna understand\nas I start to take a look at it, and\n\n392\n00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.650\nI was making sure that we saw this.\n\n393\n00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.950\nRemember that when we do connect\na computer to be able to run,\n\n394\n00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.540\nwe have this connector right here that\ngoes to where our power supply is actually\n\n395\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.500\ngonna get power from.\n\n396\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.055\nThat is alternating current.\n\n397\n00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:20.280\nNow,I know that sounds strange.\n\n398\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:20.900\nIf you already know.\nGreg,\n\n399\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.870\nyou're telling me that there's alternating\ncurrent coming into the power supply.\n\n400\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.940\nAnd why in the world is that important?\n\n401\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.610\nIt is important because every\ncomponent inside of the system\n\n402\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.580\nunit itself runs off of\ndirect current instead.\n\n403\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.040\nSo the power supply not only plays\nthe function to provide different power\n\n404\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.770\nto all those components that Wes was\nmentioning, the motherboard as well as\n\n405\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.390\nthe different devices that are inside,\nbut it also does a conversion, right?\n\n406\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.230\nIt takes whatever the outlet power is\nfrom your wall, whether it's actually\n\n407\n00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.660\nthe 240 or 220 or 110, 120 whatever it is,\nan alternating current.\n\n408\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.130\nAnd then, out each of these pigtail types\nof connections that you see regardless of\n\n409\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:10.060\nwhichever one it is, it supplies a lower\nvoltage that is also a direct current.\n\n410\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.760\nSo at its heart, at its basic function\nof what it does it is a power converter.\n\n411\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:23.050\nConverts alternating current into direct\ncurrent and when it does it it takes\n\n412\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:28.640\nthings 220 volts and it may convert\nit down to 5 volts, or 12 volts,\n\n413\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.520\nor even 3 volts of power, and so\nit does a lot of things for us.\n\n414\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.900\nAnd if you're not ever sure,\nmake sure that when you take a look at,\n\n415\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.190\ntake a look at the label on the side, and\n\n416\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:45.410\nit will normally tell you the overall\nwattage in what you need as well.\n\n417\n00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.860\nAnd if you're having to replace\none because one has died.\n\n418\n00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.000\nMake sure you get one that's equal to or\n\n419\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.060\ngreater than the number that's\nlisted here on this label.\n\n420\n00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.360\nAnd that's the key.\n\n421\n00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.340\nNever get one that is\nlower than that as well.\n\n422\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.870\nSo make sure you get one that's\nequal to or greater than that.\n\n423\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.570\nMost of the time we're not gonna\nhave to worry about this too much.\n\n424\n00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:11.510\nBut every once in a while you will run\nacross broken or dead power supplies, and\n\n425\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.710\nthese things must come out of the system.\n\n426\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.240\nIt's always best to get one that at\nleast matches, but normally they die.\n\n427\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.520\nIt's probably two or three years,\nand technology has improved, so\n\n428\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.600\nyou'll probably get one that ends up\ngiving you more wattage, as well.\n\n429\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.440\nBut do remember that conversion process.\n\n430\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.220\nIt's very important that we\nget that concept locked down,\n\n431\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.085\nand that's why we need it.\n\n432\n00:24:30.085 --> 00:24:33.570\nIt'd be very interesting if all our\ncomponents would run off of alternating\n\n433\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.420\ncurrent, but\nnone of them inside the computer does, and\n\n434\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.915\nthat's why this is also important.\n\n435\n00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:40.910\n>> Yeah, we definitely don't have\nthe case taking your components and\n\n436\n00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:46.000\ntrying to powering them to a 110 volts or\n210 volts like Ronnie said,\n\n437\n00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.640\nit's gonna do that power stepping down,\nthat power inversion, and it is important.\n\n438\n00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.300\nIt's one of the things that make that\npower supply just such an important\n\n439\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.290\ncomponent inside of our machines.\n\n440\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.110\nWell, Ronnie,\nI've got a lot more to talk about, man.\n\n441\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.670\nBut it looks like you've\nlet me talk a lot here, so\n\n442\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.410\nit looks like we are going to\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n443\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.620\n>> Sounds like a great idea,\n\n444\n00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.170\nremember that we took a look at some\nof the very basic components here.\n\n445\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.520\nWhen you talk about the individual\ncomponents within the computer system,\n\n446\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.400\nwe took a look at the case,\nwe also briefly talked about\n\n447\n00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.390\nhow that case fits in there,\ndo to something called form factors.\n\n448\n00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.930\nAnd, if you're deciding that you're gonna\nbuild your own computer, and you're gonna\n\n449\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.910\ndo something like that, and you got to\nremember that those things have to match.\n\n450\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.660\nIn form factor.\n\n451\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.770\nAt least the power supply,\nthe motherboard, and\n\n452\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.510\nthe case at the very beginning,\nat the bare minimum, those are what\n\n453\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.740\nhas to be able to match cuz they're\ngonna all go in the same case together.\n\n454\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.370\nAnd then of course,\nrealizing that we have to have enough\n\n455\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.760\npower to power up those\ncomponents as well.\n\n456\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.510\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you understand that.\n\n457\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.480\nAnd we talked about of course,\njust really one unit so\n\n458\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.380\nfar of what we normally find inside,\nwhich is a power supply itself.\n\n459\n00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.230\nAnd that is kinda one of the most\nimportant units because without it,\n\n460\n00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.770\nwell there is no raw computer\nsystem that functions and\n\n461\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.848\nall you really have is well\na very big gigantic paper weight.\n\n462\n00:25:58.848 --> 00:26:01.110\n>> That's right.\n>> It's what we have here.\n\n463\n00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.020\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n464\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.070\nSigning off our ITProTV.\n\n465\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.540\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n466\n00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.590\n>> And I'm Wes

00:00:20.080\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the IC3 Computing Fundamental\n\n4\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.270\nshow where we're about to continue on to a\npart two on different hardware components.\n\n5\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.390\nWe've already taken a look at the system\ncase and the power supply and\n\n6\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.350\ntalked about form factors a little bit and\n\n7\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.040\neven some of the platform\ndifferences that are out there.\n\n8\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.570\nAnd now we're actually moving\non to some other things, and\n\n9\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.950\nour hardware guy is with us again,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.959\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.220\n>> Thanks for having me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.140\nIt's great to be with the ITProTV crew.\n\n13\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.330\nThat's right, we are gonna be continuing\non with more of those hardware components\n\n14\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.940\nbecause, well,\nI talked a lot in the first episode and\n\n15\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.980\nwe just couldn't get all\nof those components in.\n\n16\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.510\nSo let's go ahead and dive right back in.\n\n17\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.700\nIn the first episode we looked at\nthe system unit right, or the case.\n\n18\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.980\nRemember system unit is collectively the\nwhole thing with all of its components in\n\n19\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.620\nthere, the case is one\npart of the system unit.\n\n20\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.200\nWe also looked at the power supply and\n\n21\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.520\nkeep in mind form factor,\nform factor, form factor.\n\n22\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.390\nWhen it comes down to it, three things\nthat you need to make sure match in their\n\n23\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.930\nform factor and that's the case,\nthe motherboard, and the power supply.\n\n24\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive in here.\n\n25\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.450\nThe first thing that we're gonna talk\nabout is well let's talk a little bit\n\n26\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.190\nabout motherboards right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.370\nWhat is a motherboard?\n\n28\n00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.412\nWell if the case is the exoskeleton,\nthe skin that brings everything and\n\n29\n00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.076\nholds everything together.\n\n30\n00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.770\nWell the motherboard is definitely\nthe backbone of the computing system.\n\n31\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.290\nIt's where everything connects,\nif you will.\n\n32\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.610\nAnd it is very,\n\n33\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.440\nvery important to understand what is this\nbig circuit board even doing for us.\n\n34\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.784\nWell, the circuit board itself is made\nup of a lot of different components.\n\n35\n00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:56.526\nAnd when we look at a motherboard, let's\ngo ahead, I'll tell you what, let's go\n\n36\n00:01:56.526 --> 00:02:00.330\nahead and look at a motherboard and we'll\ntalk about some of these components here.\n\n37\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.530\nI've pulled up this motherboard here,\nand you can see man,\n\n38\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.070\nwe've got all kinds of things\ngoing on on this thing.\n\n39\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.170\nRemember when we showed you the case?\n\n40\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.270\nWe did look at the back of the case,\nit had this rectangular pattern.\n\n41\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.950\nNow what's interesting,\nnotice that pattern.\n\n42\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.810\nI would almost be willing to bet that\nif I was to measure the pattern there\n\n43\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.941\nthat rectangular pattern where\nall of those connectors go,\n\n44\n00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.616\nmatches the case that we have, right?\n\n45\n00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:30.452\nNow, it doesn't match the arrangements of\nall these little openings that are called\n\n46\n00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:34.820\nconnection ports, but the square,\nthat rectangular pattern does match and\n\n47\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.010\nthat's part of that form factor standard,\nthat's where we get that consistency.\n\n48\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.913\nNow we've got other components, now all\nright, now, keep in mind that it's always,\n\n49\n00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.684\nwhen we talk about computers in general,\nit's always about information, right?\n\n50\n00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:49.450\nIt's an information system.\n\n51\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.880\nSo, what is our information doing here,\nwhen it comes to this motherboard?\n\n52\n00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.500\nWell, we have these little highways,\nthese copper highways, if you will.\n\n53\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.656\nThink of them as,\nthe road that cars travel upon, right?\n\n54\n00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:03.670\nIf I want to get from point A to point B,\nI've got to get in my car.\n\n55\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.110\nI've got to get on the highway, and I've\ngot to drive down that road, if you will,\n\n56\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.830\nto get from point A to point B.\n\n57\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.320\nWell when your information,\nwhen you need to retrieve or\n\n58\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.300\nwork with information,\nthat's basically what it's doing along\n\n59\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.070\nthese little copper conductors\nthat are on the motherboard.\n\n60\n00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.070\nWe call them buses, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.230\nAnd it's nothing more than a pathway,\na highway that the data moves\n\n62\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.350\nalong and you can see right here in\nthe middle, we have the processor, right?\n\n63\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.020\nAnd that's where the processor sits.\n\n64\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.270\nWe've got area where the memory sits and\nthen we also got some spots here for what\n\n65\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.300\nare known as expansion cards and we'll\nlook at those coming up a little bit more.\n\n66\n00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.910\nNow, We do wanna keep in mind that one\nof the things that we talked about in\n\n67\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.360\nthe first part of this was the chip set,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.300\nWell, the chip set and the CPU itself is\nsomething you really have to consider\n\n69\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.230\nwhen you look at a system in general\nbecause it defines what type of system,\n\n70\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.310\nthe DNA if you will,\nthat the system written in.\n\n71\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.220\nIf you have an Intel motherboard,\n\n72\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.990\nit's written in the language, the DNA if\nyou will of Intel, and you have to make\n\n73\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.040\nsure you have an Intel CPU that\nfits in an Intel board, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.630\nNow the other thing that you gotta keep in\nmind too is that AMD is out there as well.\n\n75\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.410\nSo AMD is another major manufacturer,\nand you don't mix and match.\n\n76\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.750\nIf you have an AMD board,\n\n77\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.450\nyou don't put an Intel processor in it,\nyou put an AMD processor in it.\n\n78\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.830\nSo it's very important.\n\n79\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.360\nI do want you to keep in mind that when\nit comes to the platform in general,\n\n80\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.020\nthe motherboard's form factor matches\nthe case, which matches the power supply.\n\n81\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.780\nIt's a little difficult on\nthis one to see here, but\n\n82\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.350\nif we look all the way\nback there at the back,\n\n83\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.620\nthere's that power connector that\nI was telling you about, right?\n\n84\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.800\nRemember the power connector we seen in\nPart I of this episode that was on that\n\n85\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.570\npower supply.\n\n86\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.440\nIt matches the power connector for\nthis motherboard, so\n\n87\n00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.470\nit is important to keep that in mind.\n\n88\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.760\nAll right, now the next thing\nthat we have to worry about is\n\n89\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.470\nintegrated components versus\nnon-integrated components.\n\n90\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.150\nThis is important because\nit really boils down to\n\n91\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.510\nrepair versus replace, all right,\nsee this little box back here?\n\n92\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.480\nYou don't really have to worry about\ntoo much, but let me just go ahead and\n\n93\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.560\nmention what that is.\n\n94\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.720\nThat's called,\nthat's part of the chip set, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.600\nAnd that is kind of like a processor,\na controller if you will.\n\n96\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.190\nIt's like a traffic controller\nsaying hey data you come,\n\n97\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.070\nyou can go from point A to point B.\n\n98\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.170\nOkay you stop hey data go on from C to D,\nyou can go ahead and move right?\n\n99\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.040\nThat is integrated in the motherboard.\n\n100\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.230\nThey soldered that into the motherboard\nat the factory, if that breaks,\n\n101\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.930\nthe motherboard has to be replaced, right?\n\n102\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.180\nThat's an integrated component,\nit can't be replaced, however,\n\n103\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.240\nnotice these empty slots here all over\nthis thing, including the CPU, right.\n\n104\n00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.974\nSocket as they call it,\nwhere the CPU's mounted.\n\n105\n00:05:55.974 --> 00:06:00.602\nThese are non-integrated components,\nthe non-integrated components,\n\n106\n00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:03.600\non the other hand,\nthey can be replaced, right?\n\n107\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.605\nIf I have a memory module or a little\nmemory stick that goes bad, I can isolate\n\n108\n00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:11.735\nit down, I can find out which one's wrong,\nI can go up to my favorite vendor and\n\n109\n00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:15.770\nI can match them up and say okay,\nI need to buy another memory stick, right?\n\n110\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.040\nI can replace it.\n\n111\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.320\nIf that fails, then yes, that day or\n\n112\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.080\nfor however long that you\ncan't afford to replace it.\n\n113\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.371\nSure you're going to have a bad day, but\nyou can at least have the ability to\n\n114\n00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:30.000\nreplace it, and you can move on\nin your computing experience.\n\n115\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.195\nNow, motherboards come in all\ndifferent shapes and sizes.\n\n116\n00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:37.628\nThat's why I say as just a last word\non motherboards, make sure you match\n\n117\n00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:42.460\nthe motherboard with the case and\nthen also pay attention to that CPU.\n\n118\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.500\nNow with all that talk about Intel and\nAMD, I guess our next subject\n\n119\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.470\nhas to be a little bit about\nthe brains behind the operation and\n\n120\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.910\nthat's something known\nas the processor itself.\n\n121\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.590\nCouple of different processors, we wanna\nkeep in mind that the CPU, if you will,\n\n122\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.890\nit's the brains of the operation, it's\nwhat handles all the computational power,\n\n123\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.790\nall the arithmetic, if you will,\nthe calculations, it comes from the CPU.\n\n124\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.510\nCouple different types of CPUs\nthat we've had over the years.\n\n125\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.575\nThey want you to pay attention to this\nbecause the one great thing is Intel\n\n126\n00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:16.820\nversus AMD, each one has stuck with\ntheir own type that they like and\n\n127\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.500\nthat's great, they're not really\nmixing and matching them.\n\n128\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.060\nThis one that you see right here,\nnotice it has pins on it, right.\n\n129\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.960\nThey call these PGA based sockets,\npin grid array.\n\n130\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.570\nJust understand, that's AMD today.\n\n131\n00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.800\nAMD is the one that if you look at it,\n\n132\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.940\nit's gonna have the pins\non the bottom of the CPU.\n\n133\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.110\nAnd that's important, because it's\ndirectly related to the mounting type\n\n134\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.120\nthat the socket has on\nthe motherboard itself.\n\n135\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.020\nNow when it comes to Intel on the other\nhand Intel uses a little bit different,\n\n136\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.291\nwell I guess a lot of bit different if you\nwill, [LAUGH] of connecting points, right?\n\n137\n00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:56.027\nThese connecting points are just when\nyou will see to hear in the second\n\n138\n00:07:56.027 --> 00:08:00.041\nwhen you mount that CPU and\nyou take this little armature and\n\n139\n00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.909\nyou pull it down it presses\nthe CPU Down into that socket.\n\n140\n00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:05.792\nAgain, if it's AMD, it's got the pins.\n\n141\n00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:10.060\nIf it's Intel, it's gonna have\nthese little flat raised surfaces.\n\n142\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.550\nThese little electrical contacts\nare just called land grid array,\n\n143\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.200\nyou might hear the term, LGA.\n\n144\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.230\nJust keep in mind that's Intel.\n\n145\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.896\nSo AMD has pin-based and\n\n146\n00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:22.430\nthe Intel-based just has these\nlittle flat electrical contacts.\n\n147\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.620\nNow we've actually got a motherboard here\ntoo and I'd like to take a second here and\n\n148\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.260\nshow you.\n\n149\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.300\nThis board that we have over here,\n\n150\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.440\nit's an Intel-based board and I told you\na little bit about that armature, right.\n\n151\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.870\nYou could see that arm right there.\n\n152\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:41.000\nAnd if I decide that I'm going to bring\nthat armature down, I just push down,\n\n153\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.840\nright, and I just pulled it out and\nnotice that the arm is coming up.\n\n154\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.590\nAll right,\nif this is an Intel board like this,\n\n155\n00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.410\nthis little plate cover,\nif you will, comes up.\n\n156\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.960\nNotice that it releases, and\n\n157\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.740\nthen it is simply just a matter\nof pulling up the CPU.\n\n158\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.612\nAnd you can see under here,\n\n159\n00:09:02.612 --> 00:09:07.262\nyou can see the fact that it's got\nthose grids, that flat contact.\n\n160\n00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:10.038\nThe other thing that I want you to,\nit's kind of hard to see right here,\n\n161\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:11.870\nis a little dot on the bottom of the CPU.\n\n162\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.480\nThat lets me know where to line it\nup inside of the socket itself.\n\n163\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:23.250\nNow if this is an AMD-based socket,\nit isn't going to have that look.\n\n164\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.560\nWhat it's gonna have is the pins,\nand when it comes down to it,\n\n165\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.860\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nmake sure that the pins are lined up.\n\n166\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.540\nThe good thing about this is this has\na notch in it, so it's kinda hard,\n\n167\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.680\nyou can break it, don't get me wrong.\n\n168\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.224\nBut it's kinda difficult and\nI can see where it lines up.\n\n169\n00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.460\nAnd the notch lines up here.\n\n170\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.670\nAnd it's just a flat cover that's using\npressure in order to hold this down.\n\n171\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.490\nAnd then all we do is we\npush this clip back down and\n\n172\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.720\nit forces that cover back down.\n\n173\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.100\nNow if you have one of the AMD-based\nsockets, then what you're gonna end up\n\n174\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.330\nhaving here and it looks like I did\nnot get that socket down there.\n\n175\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.820\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n176\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.160\nThere's a little raised groove in the wire\nhere and you gotta make sure that\n\n177\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.180\nwhen I fold that down,\nit's kind of hard to see on camera here,\n\n178\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.820\nbut that groove there should be some\ntension here, a little bit of tension.\n\n179\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.190\nAnd we push it down and it closes.\n\n180\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.200\nIf this a AMD-based board then what you're\ngonna end up seeing is that that is what\n\n181\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.560\nis known as a zero insertion force socket,\nright.\n\n182\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.880\nAnd what that is doing is just making\nsure that through all the heat and\n\n183\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.580\ncooling down and heat and\ncooling down that that\n\n184\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.070\nchip doesn't grow legs literally and\nwalk right outside of its mounting point.\n\n185\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.540\nSo a couple different applications\nwhether you're talking about Intel or\n\n186\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.300\nwhether you're talking about AMD.\n\n187\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.020\nNow what is the very,\n\n188\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.490\nvery important thing that we wanna\nremember when it comes to your CPU?\n\n189\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.570\nIntel boards, Intel CPUs, AMD CPUs,\n\n190\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.220\nAMD boards, then also pay\nattention to the chipset cuz every\n\n191\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.402\nboard could potentially have\na different type of chipset.\n\n192\n00:11:01.402 --> 00:11:04.820\n>> So Wes, taking a look at\nthe motherboard I also saw some different\n\n193\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.570\nslots on the motherboard itself and\nwe wanna talk about the idea of\n\n194\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.520\nRAM because that's an important part,\nor memory.\n\n195\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.630\nSo take us through that a little bit.\n\n196\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.290\n>> Ronnie, that's right.\n\n197\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.080\nWe've got main memory, we've got RAM.\n\n198\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.620\nRight, well, I'm calling it out like\nthree different types of RAM here\n\n199\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.920\nmore generically.\n\n200\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.130\nYou heard Ronnie mention RAM,\nthat is our system memory.\n\n201\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.670\nThat's our main memory, and\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n202\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.680\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n203\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.726\nWe've got system memory or\nRAM that we'll talk about,\n\n204\n00:11:31.726 --> 00:11:35.180\nand we've also got BIOS-based memory,\nand then we've got device memory.\n\n205\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.330\nWe're gonna wanna kinda work\nthrough each of these now.\n\n206\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.370\nOne of the things on the motherboard\nthat Ronnie's talking about\n\n207\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.110\nis a slot that allows you to\nput main memory, system memory.\n\n208\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.730\nNow when we look at system memory,\nwhat that means for\n\n209\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.740\nus is essentially just these modules,\nif you will, right?\n\n210\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.820\nThey, for the most part, they could have\ndifferent colors and on the outside you'll\n\n211\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.660\nsee some of these metal things\nwe'll talk about a little bit here.\n\n212\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:08.270\nBut this is the main type of\nmemory that the CPU utilizes\n\n213\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.910\nin order to work with your data.\n\n214\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.764\nAll right, and\nwhat happens here is the CPU uses memory,\n\n215\n00:12:13.764 --> 00:12:18.418\nthis main memory, RAM,\nas it's called as well, as a staging area,\n\n216\n00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:22.059\na temporary workbench,\nif you will, for your data.\n\n217\n00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:27.306\nAnd the reason it's temporary\nis because it requires a voltage\n\n218\n00:12:27.306 --> 00:12:32.270\nin order to maintain the data\nthat's in it, all right.\n\n219\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.750\nIt's cheaper that way because we do\nhave other types of memory that do\n\n220\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.210\nretain data and we'll get into that in a\nsecond here even after the power is gone,\n\n221\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.470\nbut it's very expensive\nin just small quantities.\n\n222\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.890\nSo for performance reasons,\nwhy do we use this as a staging area,\n\n223\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.550\nrather than other traditional storage?\n\n224\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.570\nIt's because we need to keep\nthe performance of the CPU up.\n\n225\n00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.750\nThe performance of the CPU,\nit works in nanoseconds, right?\n\n226\n00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:02.640\nAnd even faster, it's just lightning quick\nto everything else that's on the computer.\n\n227\n00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.470\nSo if we were using traditional things\nlike optical mediam right, USB drives.\n\n228\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.210\nIf we were using your traditional hard\ndrives that we'll talk about coming up,\n\n229\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.440\nwell, guess what?\n\n230\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.660\nThe CPU would never be\nable to get anything done.\n\n231\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:20.330\nSo we used main system memory here\nas a way to work with our data.\n\n232\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.600\nNow what we have here, these modules,\nI keep talking about that term RAM.\n\n233\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.660\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n234\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.800\nThat's an acronym that essentially three\nletters stands for random access memory.\n\n235\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.340\nIt's the type of memory\nthat we use in main memory.\n\n236\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.390\nIn fact, if we can look at\nthe motherboard here, we can show you.\n\n237\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.770\nWe've got some of these set up here.\n\n238\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.100\nThis is more of a traditional\nolder style RAM module.\n\n239\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.640\nYou could see it has a series\nof chips on here and\n\n240\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.056\nif we turn it over you can see a series\nof chips on the other side, too.\n\n241\n00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:52.790\nNow what Ronnie was mentioning here\nis the fact that if we wanna insert\n\n242\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.560\nthis we put this in on the motherboard,\nright.\n\n243\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.880\nAnd then we will push it down\nwhere we hear our clicks and\n\n244\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.220\nit would be sitting there\non the motherboard, right.\n\n245\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.945\nNow you might have seen in\nthe picture that I showed you, and\n\n246\n00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.629\nas well on this one,\nthat this is a little bit fancier here,\n\n247\n00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.476\nit's got a little more flashy, right.\n\n248\n00:14:09.476 --> 00:14:11.380\nWell, what is that about?\n\n249\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.060\nJust keep in mind that RAM, like anything\nelse in the system, gets very hot.\n\n250\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.610\nThese chips, if you will,\n\n251\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:21.020\nthese little modules, they have a lot of\nelectrical current running through them.\n\n252\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.006\nSo what these metal covers do is they\njust kinda spread that heat out,\n\n253\n00:14:26.006 --> 00:14:28.070\nand they're called heat spreaders,\nbut that's what they're doing.\n\n254\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.890\nThey're trying to help\nkeep these chips cool, and\n\n255\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:36.520\nas you get higher performing memory, you\nprobably are gonna find this more common.\n\n256\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.590\nNow I want you to notice that there isn't\nany color coordination inside of these RAM\n\n257\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.020\nslots, as they're called.\n\n258\n00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.610\nWell, what is that slot?\n\n259\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.720\nWell, that slot is also a form\nfactor that we have to understand.\n\n260\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.010\nForm factor, in this case, means, DIMM.\n\n261\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.710\nThat's a Dual Inline Memory Module.\n\n262\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.320\nThat's the type, the size and\nif you will, the shape, I should say,\n\n263\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.710\nreally just the shape of the socket here.\n\n264\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.840\nWe had older ones that we\nno longer use anymore, but\n\n265\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.710\nthe current model that we\nuse are called the DIMMs.\n\n266\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.990\nNow you also have some that are half\nthis size that are in laptops, and\n\n267\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.098\nif they were half of this size\nthey would be called SO-DIMMs,\n\n268\n00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:15.010\nor SO-DIMMs,\ndepending on how you'd like to say that.\n\n269\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.680\nAnd that's a small outline\ndual inline memory module,\n\n270\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.490\ntypically found inside of your laptops.\n\n271\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.670\nNow I'll go ahead and\nleave this here for now.\n\n272\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.540\nIf we could jump back\nover to the computer,\n\n273\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.270\nwe wanna talk about what's going\non here with these modules.\n\n274\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.360\nNotice that we have a series\nof pins right here.\n\n275\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.550\nAll right, now these pins are what make\nthe electrical contact to the motherboard.\n\n276\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.870\nAnd they send that information in and\n\n277\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.160\nout of RAM over those highways that we\nwere talking about, those buses, right?\n\n278\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.970\nWhen the computer or the CPU says, hey,\nI need this piece of data and it's located\n\n279\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.570\nsomewhere in this region here, it fires\noff a signal and lets a controller know.\n\n280\n00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.993\nGet me that data, and it pulls it through\nthese pins that are making electrical\n\n281\n00:15:57.993 --> 00:16:00.080\ncontact in the motherboard itself.\n\n282\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.233\nNow notice the color\ncoordination that we have here.\n\n283\n00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:05.825\nNot every motherboard is gonna\nhave the color coordination.\n\n284\n00:16:05.825 --> 00:16:07.766\nIn fact, and\nwe've got one here that doesn't.\n\n285\n00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.019\nNow, what does this mean?\n\n286\n00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.330\nAll right, well you have to\ncheck with your manufacturer.\n\n287\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.013\nAnd even if it doesn't have the color,\n\n288\n00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:15.720\nyou still have to check with\nthe manufacturer specification.\n\n289\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.610\nCuz when you install system memory,\nall right,\n\n290\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.430\nwe have what's known as\nmulti-channel architecture, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.800\nAnd guys, really simple,\nwhat we're talking about is\n\n292\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.720\nmore than one collection of highways to\nsend that information into the CPU, right?\n\n293\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.660\nWe're trying to keep the CPU busy and\n\n294\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.880\nthe problem is, everything in\nthe computer is slower than the CPU.\n\n295\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.745\nSo if we have these separate little\nhighways that are all bundled together,\n\n296\n00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:44.800\nthat can send the information\nin simultaneously then\n\n297\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.390\nthat CPU could be rifling off that data.\n\n298\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.650\nAnd depending on how you\ninstall the memory modules\n\n299\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.180\nwill really dictate whether you're\ngonna take advantage of that.\n\n300\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.580\nWill they work if you don't\ninstall them in the right order?\n\n301\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.200\nWell, they will but\nthey're gonna slow the system down.\n\n302\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.760\nSo I wish I could tell you that you\ninstall them and the blue one's here and\n\n303\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.780\nthen you install.\n\n304\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.880\nIf you're not gonna use all of them, then\nuse the blue ones, not the white ones.\n\n305\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.390\nYou have to pay attention\nto the manufacturer itself.\n\n306\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.470\nNow, if you're populating all of\nthe memory modules slots here,\n\n307\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.550\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n308\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.290\nWhat does matter though is make sure that\nyour memory is consistent, all right?\n\n309\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.525\nYou have different speeds of memory\nwhich means they can operate faster,\n\n310\n00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:30.700\nhigher speeds, think about a car\ngoing down the highway, right.\n\n311\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.203\nIf it's a higher speed then on\nthe speedometer that means you're\n\n312\n00:17:34.203 --> 00:17:34.970\nmoving faster.\n\n313\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.869\nYou can move yourself from\npoint A to point B faster.\n\n314\n00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:41.361\nWell, in the case of memory what it means,\n\n315\n00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:47.088\nfaster means we can get more memory in and\nout of main memory in the CPU.\n\n316\n00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:49.978\nSo if you put, let's say for instance,\n\n317\n00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:56.390\nthree memory modules are running at a high\nspeed and one is running at a lower speed.\n\n318\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.996\nWell, I want you to think of\na couple of cars here, right.\n\n319\n00:17:57.996 --> 00:18:01.384\nIf I have a car that can\ndo 200 miles an hour, and\n\n320\n00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:05.033\nI've got a car that can go\n55 miles an hour, right.\n\n321\n00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:09.926\nThe 200 mile an hour car can do 50\nmiles an hour, 55 miles an hour,\n\n322\n00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:14.890\nbut the lower end car can't do 210,\n200 miles an hour, right?\n\n323\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.220\nIt's not a high performance engine.\n\n324\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.030\nSo what is it gonna do?\n\n325\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.910\nIt's only gonna run at 55.\n\n326\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:25.190\nSo RAM, what it does is it will back\nitself down to the slowest common speed.\n\n327\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.580\nSo if you have 800 megahertz mixed in\nwith, let's say, 1066, which is just\n\n328\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.630\na speed rating, it means everything\nis gonna throttle itself back down.\n\n329\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.030\nThrottling means reducing the speed\nback down to the lowest memory module.\n\n330\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.230\nAll right, now, I did mention.\n\n331\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.650\nSo what's important, right?\n\n332\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.190\nOut of all this talk and\nout of all this jargon,\n\n333\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.970\nwhat is really important when it comes\nto memory and your system board?\n\n334\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.970\nReally, it boils down to what does\nthe manufacturer say that the motherboard\n\n335\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.570\nneeds, all right?\n\n336\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.920\nWhat type of memory does it need,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.400\nAnd then, what type of memory\ndoes the memory say that it is?\n\n338\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.410\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n339\n00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.320\nYou can see these little markings on here,\nright?\n\n340\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.893\nAnd the marking tells you, hey,\nthis is what type of memory.\n\n341\n00:19:09.893 --> 00:19:11.471\nI could see it's a two gig stick, right?\n\n342\n00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:12.609\nI could see it's PC3.\n\n343\n00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.875\nJust some standardized information,\nif you will,\n\n344\n00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:18.030\nmost commonly what that will be\nconsidered is something known as DDR3.\n\n345\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.320\nAll right, now what does that term mean?\n\n346\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.210\nWell, you have different\ntypes of memory and\n\n347\n00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.200\nfrom older to newer they generally can do\nthings more faster and more efficiently.\n\n348\n00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.320\nLower power.\n\n349\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.620\nAll right, so we have DDR.\n\n350\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.140\nThat's called a Double Data Rate.\n\n351\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.880\nWe have, two, three and now four.\n\n352\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.870\nDDR2, DDR3, DDR4.\n\n353\n00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.370\nAnd just keep in mind that,\nthat means slower to faster.\n\n354\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.023\nAll right, more modern is DDR4.\n\n355\n00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:47.042\nNow again, what do I need to know if\nI'm going to work on a computer or\n\n356\n00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:49.381\nI'm gonna try to service some memory?\n\n357\n00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:52.210\nI need to read the specification\nof the motherboard.\n\n358\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:59.190\nAnd if it says it supports\na maximum of 16GB of DDR3 RAM, and\n\n359\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:07.030\nI've got 4 slots, that means that I have\nto find 4 4GB DDR3 memory modules, right?\n\n360\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.169\nSo you're just matching it.\n\n361\n00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:12.220\nAll right, now that's a little\nbit about your system memory.\n\n362\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.860\nKeep in mind that when it's\ninstalled it looks like this.\n\n363\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.333\nAnd you can see that they did not populate\nall of the RAM slots that are on this\n\n364\n00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:21.258\nmotherboard.\n\n365\n00:20:21.258 --> 00:20:22.376\nNotice how they're using two?\n\n366\n00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:25.930\nAnd notice that they're not just\none right next to each other.\n\n367\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.420\nThis is where you can see that they've\ninstalled those in those pairs in that\n\n368\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.050\nright order that the manufacturer\nsaid that they should.\n\n369\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.100\nAll right, now,\n\n370\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.670\nthat takes us into another type of\nmemory that's important on the machine.\n\n371\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.307\nIt's called BIOS memory, and\nI use the term generically,\n\n372\n00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.904\nbecause you might hear of\ndifferent firmwares out there.\n\n373\n00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:46.250\nBut when it comes down to it,\nthis is a set of instructions\n\n374\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.250\nthat tells the computing system\nhow to start the hardware, right?\n\n375\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.020\nAnd it's something that\nthe manufacturer programs.\n\n376\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.970\nNow this is a form of non-volatile memory.\n\n377\n00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.150\nRAM is volatile, which means,\nthat if Ronnie's working on something, and\n\n378\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.550\nI play a joke on him, and I reach over and\npull the power on his machine,\n\n379\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.050\nall that work that he's got stored,\nand RAM is lost, it's gone, all right.\n\n380\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.140\nHowever, with BIOS memory,\nor non-volatile memory,\n\n381\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.845\nit doesn't require an electrical current\nto retain the data in it, all right?\n\n382\n00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:20.015\nMore specifically in BIOS memory,\nit's something known as EEPROM.\n\n383\n00:21:20.015 --> 00:21:24.045\nIt's electrically programmable,\nwhich means through software we can send\n\n384\n00:21:24.045 --> 00:21:28.105\nsome electricity over the motherboard and\nwe can manipulate the data in it and\n\n385\n00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:33.055\nthen when we power off the machine,\nit retains those settings, okay.\n\n386\n00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:34.795\nSo that's another form of memory.\n\n387\n00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:35.925\nWhat does it look like?\n\n388\n00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:37.225\nWell, it doesn't look like much.\n\n389\n00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:39.420\nIt comes in all different shapes and\nsizes.\n\n390\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.810\nThis just happens to be a proprietary\ntype non-volatile memory.\n\n391\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.780\nYou can see some other ones.\n\n392\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.060\nHere's some older type\nnon-volatile memory chips.\n\n393\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.250\nAgain, notice that this\ncomes back to that term\n\n394\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.840\nintegrated versus non-integrated that\nwe talked about on the motherboard.\n\n395\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.710\nIf my BIOS chip fails,\nchances are we can't replace it.\n\n396\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.350\nAll right, now,\n\n397\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.000\nin the case of something like this,\nyou might be able to replace it, but\n\n398\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.310\nin something like this it's integrated and\nit's basically the motherboard is ruined.\n\n399\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.390\nThere's one other type of memory\nthat I'd like to mention and\n\n400\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.840\nthat's a device-based memory.\n\n401\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.890\nIt can use volatile and\nit can use non-volatile, but\n\n402\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.950\nit's used in things like your hard drives.\n\n403\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.690\nIt's used in things like\nyour network adapters.\n\n404\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.120\nRemember one of the things that we said\nis that the CPU uses the memory to stage\n\n405\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.480\ninformation so\nthat it can work with it, right?\n\n406\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.610\nWell sometimes you have devices such as,\nwell, hard drives, and\n\n407\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.670\nhard drives need to\nmaintain their performance.\n\n408\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.650\nSo they'll have these little\nchips on them as well\n\n409\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.440\nthat store little bits of information.\n\n410\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.394\nSo, again, it's just another\none that I call out just so\n\n411\n00:22:40.394 --> 00:22:43.239\nyou'll know that there's\nmemory all over the place.\n\n412\n00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:46.173\nThe two main ones that you wanna remember,\nthough,\n\n413\n00:22:46.173 --> 00:22:49.784\nis the system memory,\nknow it's different types, all right.\n\n414\n00:22:49.784 --> 00:22:52.869\nAnd then I would also know the fact\nthat we have non-volatile memory, and\n\n415\n00:22:52.869 --> 00:22:55.231\nthat's what we're storing\nour BIOS instructions in.\n\n416\n00:22:55.231 --> 00:22:58.406\n>> [LAUGH] Wes, can we go back to\nthe one that you just showed us, there?\n\n417\n00:22:58.406 --> 00:22:58.921\n>> Yeah.\n\n418\n00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.241\n>> I think you just, it's just the last\none that you have, used as a CPU cash.\n\n419\n00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:04.495\n>> Cache, there we go!\n\n420\n00:23:04.495 --> 00:23:06.324\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, just wanted to point that out.\n\n421\n00:23:06.324 --> 00:23:08.020\n>> So, let me show you what\n[LAUGH] Ronnie's looking at.\n\n422\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.389\nI said cash in the traditional sense,\n\n423\n00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:13.506\nwe're not talking about\nRonnie giving me money.\n\n424\n00:23:13.506 --> 00:23:17.599\nLet me go ahead and\ndo a typo, clear a typo.\n\n425\n00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:18.633\nWell, we're gonna clear the cache right?\n\n426\n00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:19.792\n>> There you go.\n\n427\n00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:21.780\n>> All right, [LAUGH] well,\nI didn't mention this one.\n\n428\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.610\nAnd thanks for catching that and\nmy typo here on camera.\n\n429\n00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.960\nAir ball right there on camera.\n\n430\n00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.880\nSo, what is a cache?\n\n431\n00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.075\nInside of your CPUs, right?\n\n432\n00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:35.018\nYour CPUs are so fast that they need\na common area that they can get\n\n433\n00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:39.150\nto instructions that are commonly used,\nright.\n\n434\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.770\nWell, I want you to think of a highway.\n\n435\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.840\nIf I'm asking for\ninstructions I've got a couple of options.\n\n436\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.850\nI could leave the stage here and\nI could go out and\n\n437\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.690\nI could find one of our other\nhosts that are working.\n\n438\n00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.480\nI could say okay, Mike or Dan,\nhow do I get to this location?\n\n439\n00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.160\nHow do I get to this gas\nstation on some road, right?\n\n440\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.287\nWell they could tell me.\n\n441\n00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:02.488\nWell, notice I had to get up,\naway from the presentation,\n\n442\n00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:05.701\nwalk out the door, go down the hallway and\nI had to ask them.\n\n443\n00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:08.728\nWell, that's like what your CPU\ndoes when it uses main memory.\n\n444\n00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:11.267\nIt has to put that data\nexternally on that highway and\n\n445\n00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:14.280\nit has travel around the motherboard and\ngo into main memory.\n\n446\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.370\nAnd then, likewise,\ncome back when it needs to work on it.\n\n447\n00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:22.210\nAll right, now, the analogy to cache is,\nwhy would I go ask another host for\n\n448\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.390\nthe instructions when I have\ngot Ronnie sitting right here?\n\n449\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.768\nI can just turn to Ronnie and\nI can say Ronnie,\n\n450\n00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:26.908\nyou know how to get to that location?\n\n451\n00:24:26.908 --> 00:24:28.940\nRonnie can answer me immediately.\n\n452\n00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.233\nWell, that's what the caching\nsystem does in a CPU.\n\n453\n00:24:31.233 --> 00:24:37.695\nIt's a non-volatile memory, very\nexpensive, at best, sizes are megabytes.\n\n454\n00:24:37.695 --> 00:24:41.914\nAnd what it does is commonly used\ninstructions are set on the CPU so\n\n455\n00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:46.518\nthat it doesn't have to waste time\nsending it along the motherboard and\n\n456\n00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.300\nwaiting for the response.\n\n457\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.837\nAll right, so those are some things.\n\n458\n00:24:51.837 --> 00:24:55.613\nOne other thing that I do wanna\nmention too, that I didn't mention,\n\n459\n00:24:55.613 --> 00:24:57.970\nis error correcting memory, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.420\nWhen we talk about compatibility,\nyou have two major types of memory.\n\n461\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.580\nYou have one that allows for error\ncorrection and one that doesn't allow for\n\n462\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.740\nerror correction.\n\n463\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.170\nOkay, the one that allows for error\ncorrection, if you're only in a desktop\n\n464\n00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.140\nenvironment, chances are it's\nthe one you won't see, right?\n\n465\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.060\nIt's inside of our servers,\nif you remember our device types,\n\n466\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.000\nbecause it allows for correcting of\ndata so it doesn't get corrupted.\n\n467\n00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.430\nIn a business environment, we need that.\n\n468\n00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.490\nBut the business environment can also\njustify the cost because of how important\n\n469\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.580\nthat data is.\n\n470\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.010\nIn a home environment, in a small office\nenvironment, if you've got traditional\n\n471\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.840\ndesktops, you're gonna see what's\nknown as non-error correcting memory.\n\n472\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.850\nSo keep that in mind, they are not\nsomething that is interchangeable.\n\n473\n00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.848\nSo that's another thing for\ncompatibility's sake,\n\n474\n00:25:43.848 --> 00:25:46.660\nthat you wanna make sure\nthat you pay attention to.\n\n475\n00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.293\nAll right, so, one of the last things that\nI want to kind of touch base with on is,\n\n476\n00:25:51.293 --> 00:25:55.610\nwell, what are some of these other\nslots that are on the motherboard here?\n\n477\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.270\nSo, if we go back to the motherboard,\n\n478\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.780\nI actually got a couple of cards\nright here that I'm gonna grab.\n\n479\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:05.370\nI want to talk about the ability to expand\nthe functionality of your motherboard.\n\n480\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.370\nSee, the manufacturers, they get the\nability, if they want, that they could put\n\n481\n00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.680\na certain amount of functionality and vary\nthe price point of their motherboards.\n\n482\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.870\nYou want the functionality and\nyou want them to build it for you?\n\n483\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.290\nYou pay a heavy price.\n\n484\n00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.310\nYou need something more economical,\nyou might get something like this,\n\n485\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:25.870\nwhere these individual, what we call\nslots, expansion slots, are empty.\n\n486\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.680\nWell, why?\n\n487\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.580\nBecause maybe you don't need that\nfunctionality right now as a customer and\n\n488\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.290\nas a manufacturer they can\nkeep the price point low.\n\n489\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.510\nAnd then if you do need\nextended functionality,\n\n490\n00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.080\nthat's where these cards come into play.\n\n491\n00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.740\nAll right, this is a little FireWire card.\n\n492\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.638\nWe're gonna talk about\nconnection types coming up guys.\n\n493\n00:26:40.638 --> 00:26:44.566\nSo just understand, kind of like USB\nports that you plug devices into,\n\n494\n00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:46.080\nthat's what this allows.\n\n495\n00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.370\nBut more importantly for us,\n\n496\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:52.500\nwhat I want us to know is that,\nlook at the pins right here.\n\n497\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.621\nWhat we'd do if we were\nto install one of these,\n\n498\n00:26:54.621 --> 00:26:57.966\nwe could expand it's functionality by\nbringing FireWire to a motherboard\n\n499\n00:26:57.966 --> 00:27:00.689\nthat otherwise doesn't have\nthat functionality, right?\n\n500\n00:27:00.689 --> 00:27:04.500\nAnd all I have to do is install\nit right here in this slot.\n\n501\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.487\nNow, I'm not going to push down this.\n\n502\n00:27:05.487 --> 00:27:08.936\nBut this is what's known as a PCI card,\nokay?\n\n503\n00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:12.510\nIt's a little bit older of a technology,\nbut not so old that you won't see it.\n\n504\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.180\nAll right, it's one of\nthe reasons I mention it there.\n\n505\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.590\nAnd there's some that go even\nfarther back that I highly doubt,\n\n506\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.740\nunless you're in a museum,\nyou're really gonna see.\n\n507\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.580\nOr you're like me and you're a geek,\nmaybe you're doing retro computing or\n\n508\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.870\nsomething like that.\n\n509\n00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.730\nAnother one that's very common,\nthis is a video card, right?\n\n510\n00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.440\nThe point of this is that\n\n511\n00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.600\nthere is some functionality that's\nintegrated into the motherboard.\n\n512\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.360\nSome of these chips here\ncan handle your video.\n\n513\n00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.420\nThey can perform all the video\ngraphics you need, but\n\n514\n00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.410\nthey'll do it on an average functionality.\n\n515\n00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.720\nBut what if you need more functionality,\nright?\n\n516\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.560\nHence the term expansion card.\n\n517\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.240\nWe can expand the functionality,\nin this case,\n\n518\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.400\nby putting one of these cards in here and\nthis card is called a PCIE card.\n\n519\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.550\nAll right, and\nnotice that this slot if different.\n\n520\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.336\nAll right, color, yes.\n\n521\n00:27:59.336 --> 00:28:02.414\nBut, I don't always go with color\nbecause manufacturers change the color.\n\n522\n00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:08.930\nThese could be both green and black or\nblue and white, or red and black.\n\n523\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.830\nYou wouldn't know so,\nyou need to look at the size.\n\n524\n00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.070\nYou need to pay attention\nto the specification.\n\n525\n00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:19.096\nPCIE is a newer interface,\nrelatively newer in terms of computing.\n\n526\n00:28:19.096 --> 00:28:20.877\nAnd it is a faster interface, and\n\n527\n00:28:20.877 --> 00:28:24.590\nit provides just about the best\nperformance that you'll get.\n\n528\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.030\nNow, I will tell you that these\ncome in different sizes, all right?\n\n529\n00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.320\nEven though it doesn't look like it,\nyou'll see this small one back here.\n\n530\n00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.000\nIt's very hard to see here, but\nthat's also a PCI slot like this one is.\n\n531\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.090\nSo, there are different sizes and\n\n532\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.680\nit's for the different levels of\nperformance that you might need.\n\n533\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.956\nSo, pay attention.\n\n534\n00:28:40.956 --> 00:28:44.790\nPCI, it’s gonna be the same all\naway across the board, right?\n\n535\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.260\nThere's not different mix and matches,\nyou don't have to worry about that one.\n\n536\n00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.086\nBut with PCIE,\nyou're expanding the functionality.\n\n537\n00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:52.591\nPay attention to what\ntype of card you need,\n\n538\n00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:55.784\nin order to make sure that\nyou don't buy the wrong card.\n\n539\n00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:56.732\nAnd unfortunately,\n\n540\n00:28:56.732 --> 00:29:00.221\nyou have to see if the manufacturer will\nlet you get your money back in a refund.\n\n541\n00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:03.465\nSo, that's it, Ronnie,\nfor the expansion cards.\n\n542\n00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:05.995\nI think I covered everything,\nlet me just make sure.\n\n543\n00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:06.805\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n544\n00:29:06.805 --> 00:29:13.050\nJust keep in mind that if you don't need\nthe functionality, buy a cheaper computer.\n\n545\n00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.888\nIf you don't need the functionality right\naway and you want to maybe go that route\n\n546\n00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:20.284\nin the future, you can buy one that\nhas the available expansion cards.\n\n547\n00:29:20.284 --> 00:29:23.170\nAnd then, as you need the functionality,\nyou can always upgrade later.\n\n548\n00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.840\n>> All right, well, there's a lot of\ninformation for us to consider as we start\n\n549\n00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.090\nto work in the world of computing and\ndealing with the components inside.\n\n550\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.360\nMost of us are probably not gonna see\nthe majority of these components if we're\n\n551\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.890\nactually just working at\na machine at a company.\n\n552\n00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.818\nBut we will use them\non a day to day basis.\n\n553\n00:29:40.818 --> 00:29:44.840\nAnd the only thing that we want to ensure\nat this point is that you at least have\n\n554\n00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.530\nan idea and an understanding of what\nis going on inside of that system and\n\n555\n00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.520\nthose different components\nthat are in there.\n\n556\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.000\nIf you're having to build your own,\n\n557\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.960\nif you're actually purchasing one,\nyou also now understand some of\n\n558\n00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.850\nthe different complexities that\nare also inside that system as well.\n\n559\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.040\nSo that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n560\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.250\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n561\n00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.280\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n562\n00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.543\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing

00:00:17.830\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\nand you're watching\n\n4\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.696\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals show, where\nwe're about to take a look at some of\n\n5\n00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:27.351\nthe different peripheral components that\nwe can attach to our motherboard and\n\n6\n00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:30.740\nto our computer to make it\nwork the way they want to.\n\n7\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.740\nAnd here to help us understand\nthat interaction and\n\n8\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.030\nsome of those different components,\nMr. Wes Brian.\n\n9\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.130\nWes, welcome back to our studio.\n\n10\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.960\n>> Thanks for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.440\nThat's right, it's great to be\nhere with the ITProTV crew.\n\n12\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.620\nWe are looking at, well,\nperipherals, like Ronnie said.\n\n13\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.990\nAnd what is the main peripheral\nwe'll be talking about first?\n\n14\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.160\nThat's gonna be something\nknown as our monitors.\n\n15\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.070\nAnd a monitor's a very important\naspect of a computing system.\n\n16\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.970\nOtherwise, how could we tell that we're\neven working with a computing system?\n\n17\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.450\nSo, monitors are very important, and\n\n18\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.430\nthey've definitely gone through some\ndifferent technologies over the years.\n\n19\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.310\nAnd we just wanna kinda hopefully\nbring you up to speed on some of\n\n20\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.640\nthose technologies, and\nkinda show you what's under the hood here,\n\n21\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630\nso that maybe if you are going\nto be using these devices,\n\n22\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.400\nyou can make the choice on\nwhich one is adequate for you.\n\n23\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.390\nBecause some of them are old and\n\n24\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.750\ngoing by the wayside,\nsome of them you still see today.\n\n25\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.290\nAnd you might need to know the pros and\ncons over each.\n\n26\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.280\n>> Now, Wes, as I take a look\nat the idea of peripherals here,\n\n27\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.070\nit looks like that we're actually\nhitting that categorization, or\n\n28\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.470\nthe classification, of peripherals that we\ncall different types of output devices.\n\n29\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.320\nSo, can you just give a little\nbit of explanation here.\n\n30\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.889\nOutput versus input devices,\n\n31\n00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.275\nwhat do we need here when we\nstart working with our computers?\n\n32\n00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:42.769\n>> That's a great question.\n\n33\n00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.021\nSo, if we are going to interact\nwith a machine, right, and\n\n34\n00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.597\nwe have to enter commands,\nwe have to have a way that we can input,\n\n35\n00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:52.218\nwe can send commands into the machine,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:56.320\nAnd we do that through some of the\nperipherals that we'll look at a little\n\n37\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.830\nbit later.\n\n38\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.618\nThe keyboard, right?\n\n39\n00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.170\nAnd the mouse.\n\n40\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.450\nThat's how we send\ninstructions into the machine.\n\n41\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.080\nBut we need to get the results\nof those instructions back,\n\n42\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.340\nwhatever the instruction might be.\n\n43\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.510\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be like\nyour telling computer show me something.\n\n44\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.950\nWe see the results of those\ninstructions back through\n\n45\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.890\nan output device known as a monitor.\n\n46\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.200\nSo, output devices allow us to\nsee the results of whatever it is\n\n47\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.680\nthat we're sending into the machine,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.500\nSo, for instance, by click, with a mouse,\nand I point and click on a video, right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.300\nWell, I'm sending an instruction,\ninput, into the machine, and\n\n50\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.070\ntelling it to, well, play that video.\n\n51\n00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.312\nBut then I have to see the video,\nso what does the computer do?\n\n52\n00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:39.256\nIt responds to my input by\ngiving me an outbound signal.\n\n53\n00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.410\nIn this case, it'll be, the results\nwill be viewing the machine, or\n\n54\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.980\nreviewing that video.\n\n55\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.760\nAgain, input could be\njust sending information.\n\n56\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.470\nWe talk a lot about, I mean,\nthat's what computer is about, about data.\n\n57\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.710\nMaybe you're just sending information into\nlike a spreadsheet or a document, right?\n\n58\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.140\nYou're typing the information in, you're\nsending a command through the keyboard,\n\n59\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.450\nthrough its cable into\nthe computer itself, and\n\n60\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.530\nthen you see the output, the results of\nthat input, inside of the document there.\n\n61\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.750\nThat primary output interface\nbeing a monitor display.\n\n62\n00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.780\nAnd there are a few different\ntechnologies that we're gonna look at.\n\n63\n00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.360\n>> All right.\n\n64\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.990\nSo, Wes, describe for us some of these\ndifferent types of displays that we're\n\n65\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.560\ntalking about, and normally what\nare the components or devices,\n\n66\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.860\nI should say,\nthat we'll normally see these in.\n\n67\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.950\n>> Definitely, one of the first ones that\nwe talk about is, it's relatively old now.\n\n68\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790\nSome of you out there maybe watching\nthis have seen these before.\n\n69\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.350\nMaybe some of you have seen them, maybe\neven worked on them and didn't even know.\n\n70\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.160\nAnd that first one's the old\ncathode ray tube, right?\n\n71\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.830\nThese are the heavy monitors,\nif you will, right?\n\n72\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.930\nThe size of a freight train.\n\n73\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.530\nJust kidding, not really the size of\na freight train, but very, very heavy and\n\n74\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.060\nvery hard to move around.\n\n75\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.210\nNow, the CRT, cathode ray tube monitors,\nthey had some drawbacks.\n\n76\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.410\nOne of them being how heavy they were,\nthe other one being the fact\n\n77\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.130\nthat they didn't help you in\nthe space aspect, if you will.\n\n78\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.970\nBut they also were very power hungry.\n\n79\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.590\nAnd you also have to know maybe\na little bit about how they work.\n\n80\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.890\nWhen it comes to a cathode ray tube,\nessentially,\n\n81\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.100\nwhat you're doing is you're\nusing these electron beams.\n\n82\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.680\nJust call it a ray gun, if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.320\nAnd it sends three\ndifferent primary colors.\n\n84\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.340\nThe red, the green, the blue,\nI believe, down a tube.\n\n85\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.130\nAnd then what you end up seeing\nis a magnetic spreader that kinda\n\n86\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.860\npaints the image on the machine.\n\n87\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.940\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here.\n\n88\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.640\nAll right.\n\n89\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.270\nAnd what we're doing is we're just\nessentially sending three different colors\n\n90\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.300\ndown through these anodes.\n\n91\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.900\nAnd this deflection magnet, what it does\nis it bends the light to our will, right?\n\n92\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.410\nLove that, bending the light to our will.\n\n93\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.400\nWe have the power.\n\n94\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.020\nNo, really,\nit's the monitor that's doing that.\n\n95\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.430\nRemember, Ronnie said, input, right?\n\n96\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.480\nSo if I want to type a piece\nof text on the screen,\n\n97\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.850\nwe're controlling the output, right?\n\n98\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.200\nReally, it's the monitor\nthat's doing this for me, but\n\n99\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.550\nwhat we're telling it through the system\nis, hey, I wanna see this picture here.\n\n100\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.520\nI wanna see this color here, if you will.\n\n101\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.560\nI wanna see this image right here.\n\n102\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.120\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n103\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.070\nthe deflection magnets inside of it is\nwhat paints the image across the screen.\n\n104\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.290\nNow, in that same line of thought,\nI'm gonna go ahead, Ronnie,\n\n105\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.380\nand I'm gonna jump ahead\njust a little bit.\n\n106\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.150\nWhen we talk about painting\nthe image across the screen.\n\n107\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.850\nIt's interesting that\nwhat we're seeing here,\n\n108\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.630\neven though it looks like a static image\nto us, isn't really a static image.\n\n109\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.040\nIt's the fact that it is being repainted.\n\n110\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.900\nAnd what I mean by that is the image is\ngoing up on the screen and disappearing.\n\n111\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.330\nAnd then going up on the screen and\ndisappearing.\n\n112\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.596\nAnd so, that's the repainting it.\n\n113\n00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:40.110\nAgain, it dissipates, if you will.\n\n114\n00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.910\nAnd then it comes back, and\nthat's something known as a refresh rate.\n\n115\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.574\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:49.234\nNow, refresh rate is important, especially\nin some of these older CRT monitors cuz\n\n117\n00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:54.270\nrefresh rate is how many times per\nsecond that image is repainted, right?\n\n118\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.700\nSo, and\nwhat happens is at a certain level rate,\n\n119\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.830\nour optical nerves get tricked, and\nour eyes, into believing what we see\n\n120\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.060\nis a static image when really it's nothing\nmore than an image that's blinking on and\n\n121\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.670\noff so fast that it gives\nthe illusion of a static image.\n\n122\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.630\nAnd the reason I mention refresh rate\nis cuz it might be a setting that you\n\n123\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.680\nconfigure in the operating\nsystem on warning your monitors.\n\n124\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.281\nThere might a fixed refresh rate,\nyou might not be able to set anything.\n\n125\n00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.712\nAnd in that case,\nit's usually gonna be set for you,\n\n126\n00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:23.431\nyou don't have to worry about this.\n\n127\n00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:27.620\nBut in the case of the older monitors,\nyou could maybe set it below like a 60\n\n128\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.370\nHertz level, which just happens to be the\nlevel where it looks like a static image.\n\n129\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.950\nAnd if you misconfigured it, and\nyou set it a little bit lower,\n\n130\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.140\nyou start to give yourself headaches.\n\n131\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.770\nAnd the reason being is because now your\neye can pick up on the fact that that's no\n\n132\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.230\nlonger a static image, it's actually being\nrepainted, and it can cause problems.\n\n133\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.620\nNow, these are older monitors.\n\n134\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.340\nI put them in here for\nthe sake of completion.\n\n135\n00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.410\nWe wanna be consistent with something,\nnever say never.\n\n136\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.090\nThe fact that you might\nsee these out there.\n\n137\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.100\nSome people might still have them.\n\n138\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.400\nOne of the other things that was\ncharacteristic about these monitors.\n\n139\n00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.230\nNotice that we talk about\ndeflection magnets, and\n\n140\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.370\nI don't really want you to worry too\nmuch about the inner workings of it.\n\n141\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.630\nWe want you to see it here, but\nnotice that's a magnet, right?\n\n142\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.410\nThat's a magnetic spreader, if you will.\n\n143\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.085\nAnd that means that these type of monitors\n\n144\n00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:22.130\nare susceptible to magnetic fields,\nto interference.\n\n145\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.500\nSo you do have to worry about that, and\nthat's one of the things I wanna bring up.\n\n146\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.110\nOne of the drawbacks to these\nmonitors is that if you had a,\n\n147\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.310\nmaybe you had a desk fan that was sitting\nnext to the monitor that had a very,\n\n148\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.470\nvery powerful electromagnetic\nmotor in the background.\n\n149\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.270\nYou might notice, as you slide that\nfan closer and closer to the monitor,\n\n150\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.820\nyou start getting these distortions in it.\n\n151\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.440\nSo it does have that tendency\nthat it could get distorted.\n\n152\n00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.801\nNow, you also have settings on there\nthat could help you de-magnetize these\n\n153\n00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:50.764\nmonitors.\n\n154\n00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:52.540\nNow, backing up just a step.\n\n155\n00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.072\nLet's go a little bit more basic.\n\n156\n00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:54.631\nAll right?\n\n157\n00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:58.682\nIf I have a monitor, what is something\nthat I need to worry about, right?\n\n158\n00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:02.876\nWell, what I need to worry about is the\ntype of connector that we have going from\n\n159\n00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:06.392\nthe back of the monitor Into\nthe back of the computer, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:08.764\nNow we're gonna talk more about some\nof these connections coming up.\n\n161\n00:08:08.764 --> 00:08:13.180\nBut I wanna mention today what VCRT\nmonitors would use what is known as a VGA\n\n162\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.045\nconnection.\n\n163\n00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:17.584\nSo definitely pay attention to\nthat little blue connector and\n\n164\n00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.600\nI want you to be aware of that.\n\n165\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.440\nSo the CRT been around for a long time.\n\n166\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.400\nWhether you see them or\nnot is really dependent on\n\n167\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.780\nhow old is the technology that\nyou're gonna be supporting.\n\n168\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.240\nI can't rule out the fact that\nyou might see one of these.\n\n169\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.210\nBut more commonly what you're gonna\nsee is the next type of monitor\n\n170\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.420\nthat we're gonna talk about and\nthat is something known as an LCD screen.\n\n171\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.960\nNow LCD screens, these have some\nbenefits over the older CRT monitors.\n\n172\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.240\nAnd what I mean by that is with the older\nCRT monitors, again they were very,\n\n173\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.300\nvery power hungry and\nthey were not space savers.\n\n174\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.937\nIf you had to carry them around for\nany length of time,\n\n175\n00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:56.996\nyou probably wanna be using a back brace.\n\n176\n00:08:56.996 --> 00:09:01.320\nWell, the LCD monitor, yeah,\nI know another acronym, right?\n\n177\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.734\nWe're never shy of our acronyms.\n\n178\n00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:04.490\nWhat does that mean?\n\n179\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.090\nWell, instead of a cathode ray, right?\n\n180\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.923\nLike that ray gun that\nwe were talking about.\n\n181\n00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.320\nNow this uses something known\nas liquid crystals, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.070\nAnd it gives, these monitors have the\nability to be very, very thin, all right?\n\n183\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:23.150\nAnd also they can produce\na very good quality image.\n\n184\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.890\nLet's go ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.900\nlook at some of the different things\nthat you'll see in here, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.820\nThey have different layers\ninside of these monitors.\n\n187\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.920\nAnd essentially it's like a wafer.\n\n188\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.930\nThat's all it really is with a whole\nbunch of layers compacted together.\n\n189\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.190\nBut the reason I make\nmention of all these, not so\n\n190\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.120\nthat you know all these individual layers.\n\n191\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.450\nI really just want you to pay\nattention to a couple of the layers\n\n192\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.050\nthat are important, right?\n\n193\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.560\nWe have that liquid crystal layer\nthat we were talking about, right?\n\n194\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.030\nThat's how we form, if you will,\nthe image within the monitor itself.\n\n195\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.261\nThe other thing is something known as\nTFT and I mentioned TFT as thin-film\n\n196\n00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:02.460\ntransistor because you might\nhear it called a TFT screen.\n\n197\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.900\nAnd what this is is it's known\nas a thin-film transistor and\n\n198\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.730\nessentially what it does is it allows.\n\n199\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:15.600\nEvery single one of the pixels in\nthe screen to have its own light source,\n\n200\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.570\nall right?\n\n201\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.290\nThe last thing that I would\nknow when it comes to your LCD\n\n202\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.145\nmonitors is the backlight source,\nall right?\n\n203\n00:10:24.145 --> 00:10:27.040\nBecause we're gonna talk about\na couple of more kinds coming up here.\n\n204\n00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.330\nNotice that it's a CCFL backlight that's\ncold cathode fluorescent lamp and\n\n205\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.270\nI just want you to know the backlight.\n\n206\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.100\nWe've got a couple of different types\nof lightings that you might have seen.\n\n207\n00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.165\nWe have what's known as backlighting and\nwe have what's sidelighting.\n\n208\n00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:45.230\nSidelighting is when you,\nif you've ever had like a small oldor mp3\n\n209\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.230\nplayer maybe and you turn it on and\nthe light literally is on the side\n\n210\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.010\nilluminating the screen from\nthe side that's side lighting right?\n\n211\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.190\nMost of our modern day monitors\nare backlit if you will.\n\n212\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.130\nWhat really differentiates them from\nanother technology that we are gonna talk\n\n213\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.610\nabout is that backlighting source,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n214\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.970\nNow that's the liquid crystal display.\n\n215\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:14.100\nWe also have what's known as, well,\nLED, the light emitting diode, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.490\nSo what is the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n217\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.820\nLCD I got on the left and\nLED I have on the right.\n\n218\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.540\nWell, we back out here,\njust look at the color coordination here.\n\n219\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.970\nThere isn't a difference, all right?\n\n220\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.550\nBut the exception of one thing.\n\n221\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.030\nYou'll notice it still uses\na liquid crystal layer.\n\n222\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.210\nIt still has that little\nthin-film transistor in there.\n\n223\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.070\nBut I want you to notice\nthe backlighting source, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.340\nNotice that the difference is that\nthe source of the backlighting is a light\n\n225\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.480\nemitting diode.\n\n226\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.605\nSo essentially, your LCD screens and your\nLED screens are using the same technology.\n\n227\n00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:53.815\nHowever, the LEDs are lower power\n\n228\n00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:57.735\nthan the backlighting source\nin the earlier LCD screens.\n\n229\n00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:04.580\nNow one of the things to also keep\nin mind is matrix types here too.\n\n230\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.230\nThe older screens used to be known\nas what's known as passive matrix.\n\n231\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.900\nAnd that basically means that you have a\nsingle or maybe a couple of light sources.\n\n232\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.440\nAnd then all the other pixels within it\n\n233\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.130\nrely on the ambient lighting\nfrom a single light source.\n\n234\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.040\nSo what does that mean for\nus in functionality?\n\n235\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.170\nWell, it means that it's\ngoing to use more power.\n\n236\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.910\nBecause whatever is lit in a passive\nmatrix, you have to provide a lot of\n\n237\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.510\npower, so that you can illuminate what\nisn't powered in the monitor, all right?\n\n238\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.470\nSo LCD screens compared to\nLED screens use more power.\n\n239\n00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.260\nLED screens use less power\n\n240\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.110\nbecause of the LED backlight as\nit requires much power, too.\n\n241\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.380\nNow LCD also use and\n\n242\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.470\neven LEDs today use another technology\nthat's known as active matrix.\n\n243\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.010\nAnd when we talk about active matrix,\nthat's saying that every single\n\n244\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.270\npixel is lit inside of the monitor itself.\n\n245\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.028\nNow why do I make mention of that?\n\n246\n00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:08.900\nBecause you're gonna hear all of these\ncrazy terms out there that just don't make\n\n247\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.630\nsense when you're trying to figure out\nwhat darn monitor do I even want, right?\n\n248\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.960\nWe have another one.\n\n249\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.280\nYes, just when you thought you were\nsafe and we've got that settled.\n\n250\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.595\nAgain keep in mind, LCD, LED,\npretty much same the technologies.\n\n251\n00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:30.330\nThe backlighting source differs and the\npower requirements for LED are a lot less.\n\n252\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.210\nSo if you're worried\nabout power consumption,\n\n253\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.260\nLED is definitely your benefit.\n\n254\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.877\nNow we've got something that's been\naround for actually technology\n\n255\n00:13:37.877 --> 00:13:41.744\nthat goes way back and you can notice\nthat we've got a lot less layers here.\n\n256\n00:13:41.744 --> 00:13:43.227\nSo what are we talking about?\n\n257\n00:13:43.227 --> 00:13:45.089\nWe're talking about OLED.\n\n258\n00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:50.070\nNow, why [LAUGH] do we add the O in there,\nit wasn't good enough that we had LED,\n\n259\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.520\nnow we have to add an O?\n\n260\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.533\nWell, that's organic light emitting diode,\nnotice everything's the same.\n\n261\n00:13:57.533 --> 00:14:01.986\nLiquid crystal layer, the difference\nis it's an organic liquid, right?\n\n262\n00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:04.734\nAnd this technology goes all\nthe way back to the 50s.\n\n263\n00:14:04.734 --> 00:14:09.329\nWhen the military was first starting\nby taking a couple of electrodes and\n\n264\n00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:14.617\napplying it to like a a citric acid and it\nwould make this phosphorous glow, right?\n\n265\n00:14:14.617 --> 00:14:18.844\nWell, it's been revolutionized now [LAUGH]\nthat it can produce some of the best\n\n266\n00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:19.816\nquality output.\n\n267\n00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:21.820\nWhere would we find these?\n\n268\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.020\nLCDs and LEDs,\nyou typically find in larger monitors.\n\n269\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.100\nAnd I say larger monitors,\n\n270\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.250\nthey can be 19-inch all the way up\nto the high definition TVs, right?\n\n271\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.755\nWhere do you find the OLEDs?\n\n272\n00:14:31.755 --> 00:14:36.497\nWell, these are great for\nvery small devices, right?\n\n273\n00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:39.293\nBecause they use the organic\nlight emitting diode,\n\n274\n00:14:39.293 --> 00:14:41.208\nthey're less power consumption.\n\n275\n00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:44.267\nThey don't have a lot heat in them and\n\n276\n00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:48.320\nit makes them ideal for\nvery small form factors.\n\n277\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.240\nCell phones,\ntablets if you will heads-up displays,\n\n278\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.630\nyou could see them in a lot of different,\na lot of different areas.\n\n279\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.120\nSo that leads us to a slew of\nletters that it's gonna combine\n\n280\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.710\ntwo of the technologies that\nwe have already talked about.\n\n281\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.750\nWhen you see AMOLED, active matrix, right?\n\n282\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.830\nIt means that it is gonna be\na bright screen, all right?\n\n283\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.250\nThe active matrix and\nsomething that I didn't mention,\n\n284\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.490\nRonnie, the active matrix has\na better viewing angle, right?\n\n285\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.290\nActive matrix,\n\n286\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.960\nI could stand off to the side here and\nI could still see the screen, all right?\n\n287\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.911\nIf I did that in the earlier\npassive matrix screens and\n\n288\n00:15:26.911 --> 00:15:30.856\neven in some of the small OLEDs,\nit doesn't have a wide viewing angle.\n\n289\n00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:33.272\nYou might have noticed that when\nyou stepped off to the side, right?\n\n290\n00:15:33.272 --> 00:15:35.507\nIt starts to dim out a little bit.\n\n291\n00:15:35.507 --> 00:15:38.616\nWell, that's one of the things\nthat the active matrix and\n\n292\n00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:43.005\nalso another technology that you might\nsee IPS out there, in-plane switching.\n\n293\n00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:47.622\nI just want you to know that if a monitor\nsupports these functionalities,\n\n294\n00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:49.938\nit's gonna be a very bright screen.\n\n295\n00:15:49.938 --> 00:15:53.939\nAnd it's not gonna be something that you\nhave to sit right in the middle of to make\n\n296\n00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:55.745\nsure that you get the best viewing.\n\n297\n00:15:55.745 --> 00:16:00.253\nNow I didn't mark it down, but\nI'll make mention of one other one and\n\n298\n00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:04.609\nthat's plasma I don't really have\nany diagrams here for plasma,\n\n299\n00:16:04.609 --> 00:16:09.610\njust keep in mind that these do have\na little bit of a reflection to them.\n\n300\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.980\nOne thing I will tell you is they're very,\nvery power hungry, and the technology,\n\n301\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.680\nnow that we have OLED, the technology is\ntypically a lot more expensive than OLED.\n\n302\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.290\nAnd when you start getting into these very\nlarge screens chances are they're gonna be\n\n303\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.420\nusing LED-based technologies.\n\n304\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.910\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nabout the monitors themselves.\n\n305\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.370\nLet's take a little bit of time and let's\ntalk about some of the characteristics of\n\n306\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.140\nthe monitor that are very important,\n\n307\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.010\nand one of the things that we talked\nabout is something known as resolution.\n\n308\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:45.020\nNow, with resolution I want you to\nknow that it's the amount of pixels,\n\n309\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.230\nthe little points of light\nthat you see on the monitor.\n\n310\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.850\nHow, how many pixels does\nthat monitor support.\n\n311\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.260\nI've actually got a diagram\nhere that we can look at.\n\n312\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.890\nAnd some of you guys might see\nthis resolution out there,\n\n313\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.740\nnow there's all different\ntypes of resolutions.\n\n314\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.620\nAnd we could spend an hour or so\njust talking about the different types of\n\n315\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.620\nresolution, so I didn't put any in\nthe common resolutions up here.\n\n316\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.340\nYou guys can do your research, you got old\nones going all the way back to like 800 by\n\n317\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:18.690\n600 right up to the 1920x1080 and 1200.\n\n318\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.960\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n319\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:28.310\nWell, the first number, if you will, is\nthe horizontal measurement of the monitor.\n\n320\n00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:34.850\nSo if I say 1920,\nwe're talking about 1,920 wide,\n\n321\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.260\nversus 1080 in this case\nmeans the vertical access.\n\n322\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.390\nNow, if I was to take this number\nto find out roughly how many\n\n323\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.370\npixels this monitor would support, all\nwe have to do is multiply 1920 by 1080.\n\n324\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:55.450\nAnd since my math is impeccable, I went\nahead and wrote it down here because\n\n325\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.520\nthere's no way in heck I could remember\nthat number off the top of my head.\n\n326\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.530\nYou can see that we're right out around\n2.3 million pixels that a monitor that\n\n327\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.310\nsupports 1920x1080 sits at.\n\n328\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.140\nWhat does that big number really mean for\nus?\n\n329\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.510\nWhat does it mean for you, the viewer?\n\n330\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.410\nWell, that means that you as the viewer\nare going to get a better visual output,\n\n331\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.150\nall the way back to Ronnie said,\nlet's make it basic, output.\n\n332\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.740\nWell this means the output is gonna be\nhigh quality versus something that is\n\n333\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.910\nolder like SVGA resolution based\nwhere it's something like 800x600.\n\n334\n00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.600\nSo that's half as wide and\n\n335\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.810\nit's almost half as tall [LAUGH] as well.\n\n336\n00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.900\nSo you can see a lot less pixels in\nthere means a lower quality output,\n\n337\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.910\nso that is important.\n\n338\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:51.540\nThe other thing that we wanna look at is\nwhat is something known as aspect ratio.\n\n339\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.910\nI mentioned that here just so you can see,\nwhen you're making a purchase\n\n340\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.660\non a monitor you might want to\nfind out what its aspect ratio is.\n\n341\n00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.890\nHow wide is the monitor in relation,\nif you will, to its viewing so\n\n342\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.240\nits proportional relationship\nbetween the width and the height.\n\n343\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.610\nAnd think of the shape of your monitor,\n\n344\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.660\nthat's one of the things that\nyou really gotta think of.\n\n345\n00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.030\nIf you've got a square monitor, chances\nare it's a four to three aspect ratio.\n\n346\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.730\n19 by 20, this is a 16:9,\n\n347\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.640\nthese are two of the common types, and\nI only mention it so you know what it is,\n\n348\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.210\nif they tell you what the aspect ratio is,\nand maybe they ask you about it.\n\n349\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.900\nYou can see that right here.\n\n350\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.330\nAgain, it's an image, the relationship\nbetween the width to the height and\n\n351\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.900\nyou can see some of the common\nones that are in here.\n\n352\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.820\nNow in an earlier episode,\nwe talked about power supplies.\n\n353\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.970\nAnd one of the things you might\nremember Ronnie mentioning,\n\n354\n00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.230\nwas something known as an inverter.\n\n355\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.950\nWell he didn't call it out, but\nhe said it takes alternating current and\n\n356\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.130\nit transforms it into direct current.\n\n357\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.010\nNow I use this in the context\nof laptop monitors.\n\n358\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.930\nBecause when we're talking about LCD,\nwe're talking about LED screens,\n\n359\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.040\nthey work off of alternating current.\n\n360\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.680\nAll right, there's a problem with that,\nif they're in a laptop,\n\n361\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.310\nour laptop components don't\noperate on alternating current.\n\n362\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.530\nLike Ronnie mentioned in\nthat previous episode,\n\n363\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.030\nall computers rely on direct current.\n\n364\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.090\nSo I do wanna just mention that as\na component that could maybe fail and\n\n365\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.280\ncost you a couple of problems\ninside of your laptop monitors.\n\n366\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.840\nIt's the component known as an inverter.\n\n367\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.718\nAll right, it's kinda like the computer\nelectricity can't make up its mind.\n\n368\n00:20:34.718 --> 00:20:38.400\nIt takes AC power coming out of\nthe adapter into the battery,\n\n369\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.570\nturns it into direct current.\n\n370\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.240\nDirect current hits the inverter and\n\n371\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.760\nconverts it back to alternating\ncurrent to power the monitor itself.\n\n372\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.480\nWhen the inverter itself maybe fails,\nyou typically get a dim screen,\n\n373\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.410\nyou could just barely see anything on the\nscreen and sometimes you can replace it,\n\n374\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.530\nsometimes they're embedded and\nyou cannot replace them.\n\n375\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.200\nNow, what type of monitor\nyou have is always\n\n376\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.129\nbased on the video adapter that you have,\nI do want you to keep that in mind.\n\n377\n00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.660\nBecause different monitors\nsupport different standards,\n\n378\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.790\none is the video graphics array standard.\n\n379\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.500\nThe other one that we're gonna have,\nand again, we'll look at these and\n\n380\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.200\nthe connectors and connection\npoints here so you can see those.\n\n381\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.690\nBut the other one is the DVI,\nthe digital video or visual interface.\n\n382\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:32.210\nAnd then more commonly today two of\nthe high definitions that we use is HDMI,\n\n383\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.290\nand it's display port as well.\n\n384\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.320\nAgain, I make mention of them now, prior\nto actually showing you what they look\n\n385\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.780\nlike, because you need to know\nthat that directly relates to\n\n386\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.250\nthe monitors themselves, and\nwhat kind of output you're gonna get.\n\n387\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.208\nI'm not gonna take a VGA connection,\nand expect a 1920x1200.\n\n388\n00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:55.148\nI'm gonna need something that's high\ndefinition, hence, something like HDMI or\n\n389\n00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.690\ndisplay port.\n\n390\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.970\n>> You also have to remember that\nas you take a look at these types\n\n391\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.720\nof output devices,\nespecially monitors here.\n\n392\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.240\nWhen you purchase one you need to\nunderstand what these aspect ratios are as\n\n393\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.310\nwell as the resolution, and\n\n394\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.060\nyou wanna pick the best one that\nyou are going to be able to afford.\n\n395\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.970\nBecause when you pick one that is less\nthan what you feel like is necessary,\n\n396\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.280\nyou're not gonna get\nthe picture you hope to get.\n\n397\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.070\nSo, a lot of times companies will get\nwhatever one that they're essentially\n\n398\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.540\ngiven when they buy the package deal for\n50 computers, but you might find out it's\n\n399\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.570\nnot as high quality as one\nthat you would end up picking.\n\n400\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.770\nBut if you're the one\nthat's making the decision,\n\n401\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.845\ntake a look at those things that\nwe've been talking about here.\n\n402\n00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:41.165\n\\And as far as where you see\nsome of these components,\n\n403\n00:22:41.165 --> 00:22:43.185\nyou also need to understand those as well.\n\n404\n00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:45.775\nThat most of the time today,\n\n405\n00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:48.765\nyou won't see the regular CRT\nmonitors anymore, hopefully.\n\n406\n00:22:48.765 --> 00:22:51.455\nI don't even know where you'd\ntend to see those anymore.\n\n407\n00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:54.735\nBut they do have their particular\napplication that you're doing, but\n\n408\n00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:57.575\nmost of them are gonna be flat\npanel monitors, if not for\n\n409\n00:22:57.575 --> 00:23:02.500\nlike the LCDs here,\nif not those big flat screen TVs as well.\n\n410\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.640\nAnd also that idea of the inverter.\n\n411\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.100\nNow earlier like Wes said,\nI mentioned the term converter.\n\n412\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.688\nSo make sure you understand\nthe difference here.\n\n413\n00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:15.410\nConverter takes AC power and\nswitches it over to DC, direct current.\n\n414\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.270\nAn inverter though does the opposite,\n\n415\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.630\nit takes direct current over\nof course to the AC as well.\n\n416\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.250\nSo there's a lot of different peripherals\nhere but as far as the big one goes,\n\n417\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.570\nthe most impact,\nis gonna be some type of display monitor.\n\n418\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.110\nNow the other one of course is when\nwe actually have printers so Wes,\n\n419\n00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.490\nwhat do we need to know about printers?\n\n420\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.600\n>> You know, I'm going to move\ninto printers, Ronnie, but\n\n421\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.580\nI did forget something that's very\nimportant when it comes to the monitors.\n\n422\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.230\nRonnie, how many resolutions\ndoes your LCD monitor support?\n\n423\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.740\n>> It's supposed to only support one.\n\n424\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.250\n>> That's right.\n\n425\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.580\nSee, I can't trick this guy up.\n\n426\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.540\nI was gonna try to trick him and see\nif he would tell me all these different\n\n427\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.657\nresolutions, but he's in the know.\n\n428\n00:23:51.657 --> 00:23:54.614\nLCD and\nLED monitors only support one resolution,\n\n429\n00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.823\nthat's known as native resolution.\n\n430\n00:23:56.823 --> 00:24:01.152\nI didn't mention it and I should mention\nit And the earlier CRT monitors you could\n\n431\n00:24:01.152 --> 00:24:04.990\nchange resolution and\npotentially get a better quality output.\n\n432\n00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.880\nLCD and LED monitors only\nsupport one resolution and\n\n433\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.030\nthat's their fixed native resolution.\n\n434\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.836\nYou can try to change the settings, but\n\n435\n00:24:11.836 --> 00:24:15.024\nall you're going to do is get\nbigger icons, smaller icons, right?\n\n436\n00:24:15.024 --> 00:24:18.760\nYou are not necessarily going\nto get a better picture.\n\n437\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.623\nSo, I did want to throw that one in there.\n\n438\n00:24:20.623 --> 00:24:25.391\nNow, moving into printers, we really have\nthree major classes of printers that I\n\n439\n00:24:25.391 --> 00:24:27.410\nwanna take the time to look at.\n\n440\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.660\nI do want you to keep in mind that you\ndon't have to know the intricacies\n\n441\n00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.620\nin order to support these printers.\n\n442\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.087\nBut it is good to know this information if\nyou want to have a little bit more know\n\n443\n00:24:39.087 --> 00:24:40.685\nhow of the inner workings.\n\n444\n00:24:40.685 --> 00:24:43.740\nSo the very first one that I'm gonna\nlook at, I've actually got a diagram.\n\n445\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.300\nThis is called a thermal printer,\nand you might be asking yourself,\n\n446\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.010\nwell thermal printer, that's got\nsomething to do with heat right, thermal.\n\n447\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.861\nAnd that is exactly what it is,\njust think of the term thermal.\n\n448\n00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:59.796\nThermal printer means that the way that\nwe create the output is by applying\n\n449\n00:24:59.796 --> 00:25:03.720\nheat to the media, all right,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n450\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.050\nYou might say to yourself, well I have\nnever seen one of these thermal printers.\n\n451\n00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.234\nI bet you see one every day and\nyou just never realize it.\n\n452\n00:25:11.234 --> 00:25:15.869\nIf you've ever paid gas at the pump,\nif you've ever bought something and\n\n453\n00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:17.990\nhad a receipt given to you.\n\n454\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.920\nThose are thermal printers and\nwhat are they doing?\n\n455\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.504\nAll right, well there is one, a common one\nthat is called a direct thermal printer\n\n456\n00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:28.568\nand this is one that uses\na series of heating elements.\n\n457\n00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:31.890\nHeating pins if you will, and\nwhat they do is they press,\n\n458\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.226\nwe will have our heating\nelement right here, all right.\n\n459\n00:25:35.226 --> 00:25:40.569\nAnd our heating element, what it's going\nto do is it's going to make contact,\n\n460\n00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:43.540\nit's going to heat up this thermal ribbon.\n\n461\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.757\nThis is where our ink, I don't want\nto call it ink, if you will, but\n\n462\n00:25:46.757 --> 00:25:47.850\nour thermal ribbon.\n\n463\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.990\nAnd it's going to press and\nheat that up, and\n\n464\n00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.770\npress it into the paper, and\nthat's how we get the output.\n\n465\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.220\nNow, historically these have really\nonly been black as far as the color,\n\n466\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.120\nbut they've done something that's\nkind of interesting today.\n\n467\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.810\nThey can get a black, a red, and a blue.\n\n468\n00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.450\nAnd what I think's kind of fascinating\non these is just the fact that it uses\n\n469\n00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.530\ndifferent temperatures.\n\n470\n00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.070\nIt creates the color by applying\ndifferent temperatures.\n\n471\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:18.120\nThe other thing that you might notice is\nthat when you have to use a special paper.\n\n472\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.230\nSo, our thermal paper, there's a reason\nI call it thermal paper because\n\n473\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:28.300\nit's not a paper that's gonna go into\nother types of printers, all right?\n\n474\n00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.021\nIf you've ever seen where the receipt\nthat maybe you've got and held for\n\n475\n00:26:32.021 --> 00:26:33.859\na couple of years and it fades away.\n\n476\n00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:38.575\nWell, that's because it's returning\nto it's original state and\n\n477\n00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:41.150\nit will lose the color after a while.\n\n478\n00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.000\nAnd all you'd have to do really is you can\nprobably press some heat on it again and\n\n479\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.250\nyou'd see it'd change color.\n\n480\n00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.480\nSo that's the thermal printer,\nagain keep in mind,\n\n481\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.280\nit's a heating element that applies heat\nto the media to create the printed output.\n\n482\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.430\nNow the next one that we have here is,\nhas been around for a while and\n\n483\n00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.420\nthis has got several components in it that\nI want to just take a second here, and\n\n484\n00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.090\nI want to talk about.\n\n485\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.340\nThis is called the laser printer.\n\n486\n00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.810\nIt's probably one of the best\nprinters that are out there\n\n487\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.850\nas far as the quality of the image goes.\n\n488\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.110\nThere's another one, but\nwe wont really go into that.\n\n489\n00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.904\nThere's one called a dye\nsublimation printer, but\n\n490\n00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:18.420\nthis is one of the ones that's the most\ncommon in the average office space, and\n\n491\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.930\nthat's why we want to mention it here.\n\n492\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.840\nSo, what we end up having here,\n\n493\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.480\nis we have what's known as the laser unit,\nthis is where it gets its name from.\n\n494\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.290\nThe laser unit is exactly that,\nit sends a beam, and\n\n495\n00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.950\nthat beam is shot over here, to what's\nknown as a scanning mirror, all right?\n\n496\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.354\nAnd the scanning mirror\nreflects based on your input,\n\n497\n00:27:38.354 --> 00:27:43.101\nremember we're talking about input,\nback down to this centralized drum.\n\n498\n00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:47.325\nAll right, the centralized drum we can\nabbreviate and just call it an EP drum,\n\n499\n00:27:47.325 --> 00:27:49.570\nit's an electrostatic photoreceptor.\n\n500\n00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.350\nAnd what it does is it responds\nto electrical current, and\n\n501\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.790\nit also responds to light.\n\n502\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.840\nWe have a couple more\ncomponents in here too.\n\n503\n00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.960\nYou have what's known as a discharge lamp.\n\n504\n00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.680\nI want you to keep in mind that\nthis drum is constantly spinning.\n\n505\n00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.970\nEvery process that you see here is\nhappening each time a piece of paper\n\n506\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.850\nruns through this printer\nfrom your paper source.\n\n507\n00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.255\nYou have a couple of other components too,\nyou have what's known as a discharge lamp.\n\n508\n00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:19.216\nBecause we're electrifying, we're\nputting a static charge to this drum,\n\n509\n00:28:19.216 --> 00:28:23.900\nthis discharge lamp removes that,\nand it neutralizes the drum.\n\n510\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.640\nWe've got a couple of corona wires,\nand here's a technician.\n\n511\n00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.740\nIf you are going to get into this and\nmaybe support this,\n\n512\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.110\nthis might be something that you have\nto figure out if it's working right.\n\n513\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.060\nAnd the corona wires,\nthey do a couple of things.\n\n514\n00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.530\nThey charge the drum, and\nthey charge the paper, all right?\n\n515\n00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.670\nSo there are a couple of a different\nthings that are happening here.\n\n516\n00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.200\nWe've got your toner hopper,\nthat's where your toner is and\n\n517\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.918\nyou have a developing roller as well.\n\n518\n00:28:44.918 --> 00:28:49.895\nAll right, so all of these components,\nbasically send the paper through,\n\n519\n00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:52.942\nthey charge the paper,\nthey charge the drum.\n\n520\n00:28:52.942 --> 00:28:56.857\nAnd what happens is the toner is attracted\ndown to the paper as it rolls through\n\n521\n00:28:56.857 --> 00:28:57.473\nthis drum.\n\n522\n00:28:57.473 --> 00:29:02.603\nAnd then the last process that we\nsee is a fusing assembly, all right.\n\n523\n00:29:02.603 --> 00:29:06.059\nThe fusing assembly,\nwhat it does is it takes that toner,\n\n524\n00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:09.797\nwhich is nothing more than a mixture\nof plastics and resin, and\n\n525\n00:29:09.797 --> 00:29:14.120\nit heats it up enough to cook a turkey\n[LAUGH] and it fuses, hence the name.\n\n526\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.760\nIt adheres that toner to the paper.\n\n527\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.610\nIf you've ever picked up a piece of paper,\na printed output that comes out of a laser\n\n528\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.820\nprinter really quick,\nyou've probably noticed that it's warm.\n\n529\n00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.330\nWell that's because it just\npassed the fusing process.\n\n530\n00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.990\nHere's a couple of things I\nwant you to keep in mind if\n\n531\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.715\nyou start to have to\ntroubleshoot these out there.\n\n532\n00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:35.415\nIf you get, your image can smear off,\nyou might have the fact that this\n\n533\n00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:38.175\nfusing assembly has warped\nbecause of the heat in it.\n\n534\n00:29:38.175 --> 00:29:39.605\nAnd what happens is as it rolls,\n\n535\n00:29:39.605 --> 00:29:42.385\nit doesn't make complete\ncontact fusing all the toner.\n\n536\n00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:47.105\nThe other thing that might happen here\nto your laser printer is that drum\n\n537\n00:29:47.105 --> 00:29:52.320\nitself might get damaged and\nin this place, it will have to replaced.\n\n538\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.790\nSo, just want to keep that in mind there.\n\n539\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.700\nThat's another one of the common printers.\n\n540\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.990\nNow, in a home environment\nthe last one that we have,\n\n541\n00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.555\nthe most major one I would say,\nprobably is the inkjet printer.\n\n542\n00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:08.330\nAll right, and the inkjet printer\nis a fascinating printer in and\n\n543\n00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.100\nof itself and you've got a couple\nof things that go on here.\n\n544\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.650\nIn fact, let me grab this,\npull that down there and\n\n545\n00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.540\nwe'll look at these individually.\n\n546\n00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.700\nAll right, we have what's known\nas a drive belt stepper motor.\n\n547\n00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.510\nAll right, what is that responsible for?\n\n548\n00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.290\nWell, that actually helps in\ncombination with the drive belt.\n\n549\n00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.670\nIt pulls the ink cartridge head back and\n\n550\n00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:31.560\nforth across the media\nthat you're printing to.\n\n551\n00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.741\nNow, the main thing centers around this\nink cartridge and a print Head Assembly,\n\n552\n00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:36.356\nall right.\n\n553\n00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:39.828\nThe print head assembly, it's responsible\nfor the printed output that you see.\n\n554\n00:30:39.828 --> 00:30:43.260\nAnd what we use is well, a couple of\ndifferent things, we either use heat or\n\n555\n00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.550\nwe use electrical current, and\nit forces that ink out of those nozzles,\n\n556\n00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.700\nand it sprays them right on to the paper.\n\n557\n00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.090\nWhat's interesting is the first\ntwo printers that we looked at,\n\n558\n00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.640\nthey actually make contact with the media.\n\n559\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.890\nThis one, doesn't make contact\nwith the media at all.\n\n560\n00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.420\nIt actually sprays the liquid or\nthe ink out of the cartridge, and\n\n561\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.660\nyou typically have different cartridges.\n\n562\n00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.220\nYou'll have your four different cartridges\nthere and I've got the colors up here too.\n\n563\n00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.800\nThe next thing you have\nis the guiding rod.\n\n564\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.160\nThe guiding rod is what the print\ncartridge moves along as it goes back and\n\n565\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.590\nforth with the drive belt\nstepper motor there, all right.\n\n566\n00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.000\nNext thing you have and\nthese could be a couple of different ways,\n\n567\n00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.680\na lot of times they are friction feed.\n\n568\n00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.469\nYou have how the paper advances,\nall right, and\n\n569\n00:31:30.469 --> 00:31:33.159\nthe paper advances out of the machine\nthrough these rollers that grab it.\n\n570\n00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:36.420\nYou could have a friction feed, which is\ntwo rollers that are pressing down on\n\n571\n00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.920\nthat paper, and they are turning it and\npulling it out of the machine.\n\n572\n00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.954\nOne of the things that I would keep in\nmind on this one is that if you don't\n\n573\n00:31:44.954 --> 00:31:49.392\nprint often enough on these printers,\nthe ink nozzles could get clogged up and\n\n574\n00:31:49.392 --> 00:31:53.112\nif that's the case,\nthe printer isn't gonna print correctly.\n\n575\n00:31:53.112 --> 00:31:56.241\nSo just keep in mind those\nare the three major types of printers\n\n576\n00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:57.272\nthat you might see.\n\n577\n00:31:57.272 --> 00:32:02.000\nAgain, the thermal printer, the laser\nprinter as well as the ink printer.\n\n578\n00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.122\nI do wanna take a second and\n\n579\n00:32:03.122 --> 00:32:05.730\ntalk about some of the connections\nhere that you could have.\n\n580\n00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.610\nHow do we actually\nconnect to these devices?\n\n581\n00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.200\nWell, there's a couple of old ones that\nI don't really know that you'll see,\n\n582\n00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.030\nbut I do still,\nI mention them here just so you're aware.\n\n583\n00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.430\nThere's the old serial based printers,\nright?\n\n584\n00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.330\nThe serial connection, there's something\nknown as the parallel connection,\n\n585\n00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.179\nagain, those are more legacy today.\n\n586\n00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:26.071\nI highly doubt that you're gonna,\nreally you never say never, but\n\n587\n00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:28.364\nI highly doubt you'll come\ninto contact with those.\n\n588\n00:32:28.364 --> 00:32:31.665\nBut, more common today we\nhave USB-based printers,\n\n589\n00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:36.548\nwe have printers that also connect through\nthings like wireless and Bluetooth,\n\n590\n00:32:36.548 --> 00:32:41.010\nas well as potentially Thunderbolt\nconnections, likewise, too.\n\n591\n00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.430\nYou're seeing this commonly,\nwhere probably one of the most common for\n\n592\n00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.770\na long time have been the USB connections,\nright?\n\n593\n00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.326\nMore common or even more common today is\nnow wireless printing, where in fact,\n\n594\n00:32:52.326 --> 00:32:55.590\nI don't have to have a direct\nconnection to the printer,\n\n595\n00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.174\nwe can print to it over\nthe wireless network.\n\n596\n00:32:58.174 --> 00:33:01.225\nNow I didn't put this in the notes,\nthere's another technology out there\n\n597\n00:33:01.225 --> 00:33:03.752\ncalled NFC printing,\nwhich is near-field communication.\n\n598\n00:33:03.752 --> 00:33:07.212\nAnd, essentially, if you've got it set up,\nit means I could take a mobile phone,\n\n599\n00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:10.490\ntouch it right to the printer, and it\nsends the print job right to the printer.\n\n600\n00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.630\nA little eccentric, love it, but\nmore commonly USB and wireless.\n\n601\n00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.290\nThe last thing I want to mention\nin this are the consumables.\n\n602\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.350\nWhat is it that we have to pay for?\n\n603\n00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.690\nInk cartridges, all right?\n\n604\n00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.510\nYou're gonna have to replace\nyour ink cartridges.\n\n605\n00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.150\nI know they're expensive,\nI know that's usually the burden.\n\n606\n00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.710\nThat's usually the point you\nthrow away the printer and\n\n607\n00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.730\nbuy a new one cuz the cartridges\nare more expensive, but just kidding.\n\n608\n00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.670\nDon't really do that,\n\n609\n00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.610\nbut that's one of the things that you\nhave to replace in the inkjet printers.\n\n610\n00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.840\nIn the laser printer,\nit's the toner cartridge,\n\n611\n00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.730\ntypically that has to be replaced.\n\n612\n00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.690\nIn a thermal printer,\na lot of times it's just a ribbon and\n\n613\n00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.760\nthe paper, but there might be a case and\n\n614\n00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.460\nscenario where you have to clean the\nthermal, the heating elements in there.\n\n615\n00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.890\nAt worst case scenario, they might be\nreplaceable, but they can get clogged up\n\n616\n00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:58.080\nwith little debris, so potentially those,\nand then last is just your paper, right?\n\n617\n00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.670\nLabels, cardstock, envelopes, again,\n\n618\n00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.570\nnormal printing paper, that's all gonna\nbe stuff that we're gonna have to buy.\n\n619\n00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.240\nIt's gonna be stuff that\nwe're gonna have to replace.\n\n620\n00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.920\nI do want to make mention though, keep\nin mind that thermal paper is a special\n\n621\n00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.350\npaper, and you can't just put an average\npaper inside of a thermal printer, or,\n\n622\n00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.950\nwell, you're gonna cause a fire.\n\n623\n00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.400\nThat's not a good day at the office cuz,\n\n624\n00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.870\nkeep in mind, everything else\nin the office can go wrong, but\n\n625\n00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.368\nif you have a printer up and running,\nat least you could print your resume.\n\n626\n00:34:24.368 --> 00:34:28.074\n>> All right, Wes, well, thank you for\nintroducing us to some of this different\n\n627\n00:34:28.074 --> 00:34:31.670\ntypes of output peripherals that we're\nmore than likely to encounter, and\n\n628\n00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.350\nalso taking a look at the technologies\nthat help us to connect them together.\n\n629\n00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.110\nWhether we are using, of course,\n\n630\n00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.070\na cable or whether we are using something\nlike a wireless connection to do so.\n\n631\n00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.080\nWell, that's great place for\nus to also in this episode then.\n\n632\n00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.503\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n633\n00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:48.579\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n634\n00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:53.058\n>> And you wanna stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n635\n00:34:54.412 --> 00:35:00.895\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.090\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n4\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.900\nand you're watching\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals Show,\n\n5\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.370\nwhere we are about to take a look at\na part two in terms of peripherals.\n\n6\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.110\nAnd we've already been talking about some\nof the different output devices that we\n\n7\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.730\nhave been able to understand that\nwe're gonna use with our computers.\n\n8\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.480\nAnd this time, we're actually turning\nour focus, well, toward the input.\n\n9\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.330\nAnd who better to help us to\nunderstand how to get more information\n\n10\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.360\ninto the computer?\n\n11\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.460\nWell, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.540\nSo, Wes, welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.200\n>> Thank you, and hopefully that\ninformation that comes out is actually\n\n14\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.629\nsomething that's intelligible, for sure.\n\n15\n00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully.\n\n16\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.880\n>> That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.438\nSo, we're gonna be looking at some of\nthe devices that we use to interact with\n\n18\n00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:53.807\ncomputer versus some of the,\n\n19\n00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:57.340\nin the first episode we talked about\nthings like our printers, if you will.\n\n20\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.840\nWe talked about display devices.\n\n21\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.520\nRemember that the printers\nwe talked about,\n\n22\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.440\nwe talked about some of the major ones.\n\n23\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.700\nThe thermal printer, common to see\nthose inside of things like your\n\n24\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.720\npoint of sale systems and\nyour gas stations, right?\n\n25\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.490\nGrocery stores will\nprint you out receipts.\n\n26\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.130\nThe laser printer,\nwe talked about as well.\n\n27\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.570\nKeep in mind, it's a very fast and\nefficient printer.\n\n28\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.490\nIt also has a good little expense\nthat comes along with it.\n\n29\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.670\nSo, it's perfect for\nsomething like the enterprise environment.\n\n30\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.790\nNow, please don't get me wrong.\n\n31\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.400\nYou can certainly get a laser printer for\nyour house, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.410\nmore power to you if you've\ngot the money to spend that.\n\n33\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.120\nBut you primarily can find those, and\n\n34\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.110\nvery big laser printers,\ninside of corporate environments.\n\n35\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.820\nThe one that's most common inside of your\nhome environment's pretty much the inkjet,\n\n36\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.300\nand it's just a common printer\nthat you can see in there.\n\n37\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.920\nWe talked about some of the display\ndevices, remember, too.\n\n38\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.620\nThe old CRTs, we talked about LCD,\nLED, and even OLED.\n\n39\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.990\nAnd if that slew of alphabet soup\ndoesn't make sense to you, go back and\n\n40\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.960\nwatch part one, and\nthen we'll see you back here in part two.\n\n41\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.580\nNow, what we're gonna look at\nare some of the input devices.\n\n42\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.920\nMore specifically,\nhow do we interact with the machine?\n\n43\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.820\nWe've talked about we see some\nof the output coming back,\n\n44\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.660\ntypically through your display devices.\n\n45\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.480\nBut how do we enter\ncommands into the machine?\n\n46\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.370\nRemember, in the computing environment,\nit's an interactive environment, right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.350\nAnd what I mean by interactive is\nyou have to interact with it to get\n\n48\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.400\nany of that output back.\n\n49\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.720\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n50\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.670\none of the first things we wanna talk\nabout is the idea of the keyboard.\n\n51\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.790\nKeyboards have been around for\na very long time.\n\n52\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.680\nYou might say, well,\nthe keyboard only goes back to the 60s.\n\n53\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.930\nWell, no, it actually goes back to\nthe 1800s if you really think about it.\n\n54\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.383\nIt's one of the closest things that we\nhave today to the traditional typewriter.\n\n55\n00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:35.885\nAnd it's a familiar interface, and\n\n56\n00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.000\nthat's what makes it a really\ncommon interface, even for\n\n57\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.340\npeople that maybe remember the typewriter\nwhen that is what you actually typed on.\n\n58\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.340\nYou didn't have a keyboard.\n\n59\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.975\nSo, one of the great things about that\nis it doesn't matter if you are old or\n\n60\n00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:51.280\nyou're young, it does give you a familiar\nway to interact with the machine.\n\n61\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.230\nSo, I'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead, and\n\n62\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.380\nI have got a couple of these devices\nthat I would like to talk about.\n\n63\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.710\nHere is your traditional keyboard, and\n\n64\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.460\nthere are few different\ntypes of keyboards.\n\n65\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.770\nWhat we're talking about, the standard\nthat's out there, is called AT enhanced.\n\n66\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.860\nAnd this one that's pretty much\nbeen the standard for a while.\n\n67\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.030\nNow, I do make mention of a standard.\n\n68\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.210\nI will tell you this a Windows\nbased keyboard, Windows centric.\n\n69\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.050\nSo, it's got a few extra keys that\nare really just gonna be here,\n\n70\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.010\na couple of extra keys, that are gonna\nbe specific to the Windows environment.\n\n71\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.910\nYou also have Mac based keyboards,\nthey're different for\n\n72\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.560\nthe most part a little bit in some\nof the extra keys that they have.\n\n73\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.000\nBut this basic part that you see in\nhere is pretty much the same across\n\n74\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.430\nmost of your touch, even your\ntouch interfaces are fairly close.\n\n75\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.499\nThat's the QWERTY keyboard.\n\n76\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.350\nNow, we basically type input in this,\nright?\n\n77\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.863\nWe're very basic, we, what you type into\neither a text document, if you're typing\n\n78\n00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:48.080\nin commands, we'll look at the operating\nsystem coming up a little bit later.\n\n79\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.980\nThis is the way you interact\nwith the operating system.\n\n80\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.040\nNow, in the earlier days,\n\n81\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.208\nthis would be the only way you would\ninteract with the operating system.\n\n82\n00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:59.060\nPretty much back in those days you\nalmost had to be a programmer in\n\n83\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.300\norder to even work with a computer.\n\n84\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.570\nThank goodness today we've got some\ntechnologies that we've mentioned\n\n85\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.900\ninside of the operating system\nepisode called point and click.\n\n86\n00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.430\nWell, with point and click that brings\nin new functionalities that we have.\n\n87\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.790\nWe have, for instance,\nthings like our optical mice.\n\n88\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.730\nNow, this is actually\na wireless mouse here, too.\n\n89\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.010\nAnd if I turn that on you might be\nable to see that little red dot.\n\n90\n00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.950\nBarely get that in the camera here.\n\n91\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.940\nTurn that back off and on,\nand just barely see it there.\n\n92\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.440\nThat's an optical mouse.\n\n93\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.970\nNow, they do have the older roller\nball mouse, mechanical mouse, and\n\n94\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.990\nit would have the little\nball bearing in here.\n\n95\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.360\nYou might see those still.\n\n96\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.170\nAgain, they're kind of legacy today.\n\n97\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.850\nThey're out there, by all means.\n\n98\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.040\nDon't think that just because it's not the\nnewest technology that you won't see it.\n\n99\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.150\nBut this is really common.\n\n100\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.380\nAnd this is the wireless mouse.\n\n101\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.100\nAnd one of the things you have to keep in\nmind with these is these take batteries.\n\n102\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.770\nUnlike a cord,\n\n103\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.230\na wired mouse is typically a USB plug or\nmaybe the old PS2 ports.\n\n104\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.210\nWe'll look at those ports and those\nconnections coming up in another episode.\n\n105\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.350\nBut do be aware of that.\n\n106\n00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.880\nAnd also, keep in mind that that's\none of the things with wireless.\n\n107\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.160\nWhat are the benefits of wireless\nversus wired when it comes to these\n\n108\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.880\ninput devices?\n\n109\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.640\nAnd the same thing goes with keyboards.\n\n110\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.470\nWell, with a wired device, one of\nthe things that you have is you do have\n\n111\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.920\na limitation in the fact that you're gonna\nbe tied down to your system unit, right?\n\n112\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.900\nAnd for some people,\nif you're in a cubicle at your office,\n\n113\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.250\nif you've got your desk,\nsome people, that is perfectly fine.\n\n114\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.950\nWell, the wired mouse,\n\n115\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.820\nwhere it comes in, actually wireless\nkeyboards excuse me, wireless mouse.\n\n116\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.580\nWhat they allow us to do is they allow\nus to free some of those limitations,\n\n117\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.810\nthose bonds that keep us\nattached right to our desk.\n\n118\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.440\nLike I said, for\n\n119\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.280\nsome people it's not really a big deal\nbecause they don't move that far.\n\n120\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.740\nMe personally,\nI like the wired mouse cuz it can\n\n121\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.000\nalso free up things like the rats nest\nthat I call it behind the computer, right?\n\n122\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.510\nAll of the cables being plugged in,\nthey can cause, if you're like me, and\n\n123\n00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.300\nyou got Ronald McDonald sized feet,\nyou can kick the cable\n\n124\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.820\nout of the back of the computer, and\nthen you're not using it adequately.\n\n125\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.420\nBut those are the two primary interfaces,\nand\n\n126\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.370\nI wanna kinda step back a little bit and\ntalk a little bit more about the keyboard.\n\n127\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.630\nThere are some different types of\nkeyboards that they have out there.\n\n128\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.920\nThe primary one that we've shown\nyou here was the most common, but\n\n129\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.470\nthere's also ones for more of\na posturepedic type, resting, if you will.\n\n130\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.580\nPeople that are worried about\nthings like rheumatoid arthritis,\n\n131\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.400\nmaybe some tendonitis in their hands, do\na lot of data entry, are constantly just\n\n132\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.310\ntyping, they might wanna rest their\nhands in a more comfortable position.\n\n133\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.040\nSo that's where things like ergonomics\ncome into play, an ergonomic keyboard.\n\n134\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.900\nPersonally, I don't really\nlike the ergonomic keyboard,\n\n135\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.870\nI can't get used to it.\n\n136\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.200\nBut I have seen people that swear by them.\n\n137\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.740\nAnd again, what they do is\nthey break up the keyboard and\n\n138\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.860\narrangement to where you're sitting\nin a more comfortable position, and\n\n139\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.360\nthen rest your arm, your hands,\nin a better position.\n\n140\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.170\nSo, if you are one of those ones\nthat do a lot of data entry,\n\n141\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.940\nkeep in mind that in computing,\nrepetitive strain injury can happen.\n\n142\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.280\nI know it sounds kinda funny, well,\nyou're just typing on the keyboard.\n\n143\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.660\nBut if you're typing on a keyboard for\n\n144\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.620\neight hours a day, five days a week,\nyou can definitely see where maybe\n\n145\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.552\nthe ergonomic keyboard might\ncome into play for us.\n\n146\n00:07:19.552 --> 00:07:20.070\n>> All right.\n\n147\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.230\nSo, what Wes was talking about is kind\nof an unusual position of your hands\n\n148\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.755\nversus the way that keyboards\nwere normally designed.\n\n149\n00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:30.830\nAnd the keyboard that Wes showed us on\nthe screen was just a rectangle in which\n\n150\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.160\nthe keys are right there.\n\n151\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.740\nAnd if you have that sitting in front of\nyou and you go to type, well, your hands\n\n152\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.790\nare actually resting in an unnatural\nposition compared to where your arms are.\n\n153\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.120\nAnd if I tilt my hand down,\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n154\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.363\nSo now, you actually see where my hand is\nalmost pointing directly towards you, and\n\n155\n00:07:47.363 --> 00:07:50.072\nnotice how my arm is not,\nit's actually at an angle.\n\n156\n00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:54.165\nWell, both hands, if I keep them like\nthat, essentially like that, and\n\n157\n00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:58.059\ntyping then, well, that puts a lot\nof strain on your wrist muscles and\n\n158\n00:07:58.059 --> 00:07:59.328\non the tendons there.\n\n159\n00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:04.156\nAnd maybe even cause a little bit of bone\nkind of rubbing together just a little bit\n\n160\n00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:07.210\nto where it becomes hurtful\nafter a period of time.\n\n161\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.090\nAnd you will end up with some repetitive\nstress injuries that can end up happening.\n\n162\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.190\nSo instead, at some point in time,\nsomebody developed a keyboard\n\n163\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.860\nthat allows you, instead, to have your\nhands in a more natural position.\n\n164\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.650\nSo if you think about sitting down at\na table and you put your hands on or\n\n165\n00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.550\nyour arms on the table like this,\nwell now that's what you're looking at.\n\n166\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.870\nAnd like I said if I show you,\nnow my hands are actually in this way.\n\n167\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.850\nAnd so the keyboard is also split\nwhere it's actually like that.\n\n168\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.080\nSo now I'm kind of typing in\na more natural position, and\n\n169\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.000\na lot less stress on these.\n\n170\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.580\nNow I believe Wes actually has an image\nof an ergonomic keyboard for us.\n\n171\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.460\n>> That's right, if we take a look at my\ncomputer here we've actually got one up on\n\n172\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.130\nthe screen here.\n\n173\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.040\nAnd you can see exactly\nwhat Ronnie is saying.\n\n174\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.190\nNotice that the positioning is\ndifferent on that keyboard.\n\n175\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.340\nThey all differ by the way to this\njust happens to be an example of one.\n\n176\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.090\nCheck out if you are going\nto use ergonomics.\n\n177\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.244\nMake sure you test the keyboard out if\nyou're going down this might be something\n\n178\n00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.141\nthat you don't want to\nbuy on line maybe you do.\n\n179\n00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.847\nBut I would say that if you are going to\nbe in the ergonomic keyboard or supporting\n\n180\n00:09:02.847 --> 00:09:07.552\nsomebody that uses one, try to keep in\nmind that you definitely wanna be using or\n\n181\n00:09:07.552 --> 00:09:10.040\ntesting it out beforehand.\n\n182\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.790\nNow, the next thing that I wanna\ntalk about is a little bit about\n\n183\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.400\nthe connections.\n\n184\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.380\nI mentioned USB and I say that we were\ngonna say that but let's go ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.740\nI think it does do us benefit here to talk\nabout the connections that you can find\n\n186\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.350\nfor your wire based keyboard and\nyour wire based mouse.\n\n187\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.610\nThe first one that I have pulled\nup here is an oldie but goodie.\n\n188\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.240\nGoes back very a long ways but\nyou'll still see it today.\n\n189\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.210\nIt's still used in those thin clients\nwe were talking about as well\n\n190\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.820\nwhen we were talking about device types.\n\n191\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.000\nThis is something known as the PS2 port.\n\n192\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.850\nKeep in mind, you can see a little\nsix-pinned connector here.\n\n193\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.110\nNow this has, and this is common\nin more modern motherboards;\n\n194\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.510\nBecause the color coordination\nis really just for us humans,\n\n195\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:51.640\nit doesn't really matter both of the ports\nif you will, control the same aspect.\n\n196\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.880\nThey'll either control the mouse,\nor control the keyboard.\n\n197\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.570\nThis one just happens to have both\nof those colors together today\n\n198\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.130\ncuz they're saying you can plug\nin a PS2 based keyboard or\n\n199\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.260\nyou can plug in a PS2 based mouse.\n\n200\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.190\nHowever, if you do see them separated,\nand they're green and they're purple.\n\n201\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.910\nTraditionally, green has been for\nthe mouse and\n\n202\n00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.530\npurple has been for the keyboard.\n\n203\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.460\nHowever, like you see here and\nthe reason that they combine them is\n\n204\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.230\nbecause the color\ncoordination is exactly that.\n\n205\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.700\nIt's just the color, it doesn't change\nthe functionality of the port itself.\n\n206\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.630\nHowever, most common today if you're using\na wired keyboard is probably going to be\n\n207\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.630\nthis guy here, and\nthat is your USB connection.\n\n208\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.500\nRemember it's just as simple as plugging\nthe keyboard into the computer.\n\n209\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.340\nNow that being said,\nI just wanna recap as well.\n\n210\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.260\nRemember optical mice as far as\nwhen we talk about optical mice,\n\n211\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.950\nwe talk about a better tracking.\n\n212\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.320\nIt's using an optical laser and\n\n213\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.830\nas you move your mouse around that laser\npicks up and it senses the motion and\n\n214\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.930\nit adjust something called\nthe cursor on your screen.\n\n215\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.410\nNow, remember the cursor is just\nthat little arrow that you see,\n\n216\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.190\nsometimes it's called pointer, right?\n\n217\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.070\nThat's one of the benefits today of not\nhaving to type everything out in your\n\n218\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.460\nkeyboard and being able to use that mouse,\nthat's called point and click technology.\n\n219\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.980\nYou probably hear that term come\nup a little bit more when we\n\n220\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.010\ntalk about computing architecture.\n\n221\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.070\nNow, there's still more\nto go believe it or not,\n\n222\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.270\nwe still have more ways that we\ncan interact with our devices.\n\n223\n00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.730\nOne of the one's that I can\ntell you honestly Ronnie,\n\n224\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.370\nI've never really like this one\nit's called the tract point.\n\n225\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.830\nThe track point started,\n\n226\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.170\nactually I can't tell you exactly what\ncomputer had started this, I have an idea\n\n227\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.400\nthat was on the IBM think pad but I'm\nnot really sure that was the first one.\n\n228\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.750\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n>> And it is true, yeah.\n\n229\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:33.350\nI did still continue today IBM got\nout of the PC market so it's Lenovo,\n\n230\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.770\nbut it's still the same\nexact design pretty much.\n\n231\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.720\nAnd the track point, I've actually\npulled up here, I always joke around and\n\n232\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.310\nI call it the little pencil eraser head\nright in the middle of the keyboard.\n\n233\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.360\nNow this is actually akin to an optical\nmouse or a mouse if you will.\n\n234\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.540\nThey also call it a pointing stick at\ntimes too, so if you hear those two terms\n\n235\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.700\nare using they're synonymous,\nthey're interchangeable.\n\n236\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.790\nAnd basically what I do is\nthat I press my finger down,\n\n237\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.050\nkinda like we do on a touch pad.\n\n238\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.140\nWe'll talk a little bit more\ntouch interface face coming up.\n\n239\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.210\nAnd I could manipulate the cursor just\nby leaning the track point back and\n\n240\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.540\nforth up and down and\nit'll sense the motion on the display,\n\n241\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.080\nthe monitor the output that you receive so\nyou could do your point and\n\n242\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.040\nclick and click on different things as you\nnavigate your way through the interface.\n\n243\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.820\nThe other thing that we have as well,\nwe have touchpads.\n\n244\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.560\nTouchpads is a common interface.\n\n245\n00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.650\nYou find them on a lot\nof your lap Laptops.\n\n246\n00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.680\nWe did talk about them just briefly in\na previous episode when we mentioned\n\n247\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.260\nlaptops.\n\n248\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.390\nAnd again remember they sense the movement\nif you will by making contact,\n\n249\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.610\nphysical contact with the touchpad itself.\n\n250\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.380\nAnd there's all different\nvariations of them.\n\n251\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.510\nHowever they're common to the fact\nthat they got just a little square\n\n252\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.830\ninterface if you will\nthat can be stand alone.\n\n253\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.500\nYou do find them on things like sometimes\nsome point of sales systems where they\n\n254\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.240\nactually, the touch interface can be used\nto sign your name in agreements and it's\n\n255\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.390\njust done with a stylus but essentially\nit's nothing more than a touch pad.\n\n256\n00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.415\nLet's see here, what else do we have?\n\n257\n00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:06.305\nThe next one that we have is well\ntouch screen and touch screen,\n\n258\n00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:07.575\nwe've actually got a tablet here.\n\n259\n00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:12.575\nTouch screen is a, I don't wanna\nsay completely new interface, but\n\n260\n00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:15.845\nwe are talking about some technologies\nthat have been around here.\n\n261\n00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:18.525\nAnd let me show everybody on camera\n\n262\n00:13:18.525 --> 00:13:22.119\nmy super secret password because\nthat is safe right guys?\n\n263\n00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.600\nJust kidding,\ndon't ever do this in real life.\n\n264\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.880\nBut notice that basically how I'm\ninteracting with this is exactly like I\n\n265\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.950\nsaid, we're using the touch interface.\n\n266\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.610\nWe can press things to bring up,\nopen applications.\n\n267\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.490\nI can do a single tap right,\n\n268\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.620\ndepending on where you're at,\na single tap can select an item.\n\n269\n00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.280\nIn this case it selected\nthe maximize option on the window.\n\n270\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.060\nYou can press and hold, and\nwhen you press and hold,\n\n271\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.940\nyou can drag things around\nthe interface if you need to.\n\n272\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.090\nThere's also, and\nlet me see if this one will do this, yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:03.970\nThere's a way that you can do basically\na pinch kinda gesture or motion,\n\n274\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:09.450\nif you will and if you're on a,\nin this case I'm in Windows/File Explorer,\n\n275\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.600\nand what it's doing is it's\nadjusting the size of the icons.\n\n276\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.100\nIf I happen to be in like for instance\na browser, one of the great things is\n\n277\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.100\nthe pinch actually will zoom the browser,\nit will increase the font\n\n278\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.080\nsize in the browser and you pinch and\nyou can basically zoom in and zoom out.\n\n279\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.730\nSo that's a really good\nthing to have as well.\n\n280\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.710\nThe other type of ways that you\ncan interact with a device is\n\n281\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.410\nthe swipe motion.\n\n282\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.950\nLet's try that again here.\n\n283\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.680\nThere we go.\n\n284\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.170\nThe swipe motion, and again that sometimes\nwill change different interfaces.\n\n285\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.780\nIn fact, if we can bring it back\nto my screen here real quick,\n\n286\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.700\nI'll show you what we can do here.\n\n287\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.460\nWe can do swipe motions as well, and\nagain, it's exactly what it sounds.\n\n288\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.470\nIt can be two or three fingers on\nthe board, and you just swipe to the side.\n\n289\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.590\nIn this case, on our little\ntablet here that we're showing,\n\n290\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.270\nthe tablet itself,\nit's just one finger, right?\n\n291\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.670\nAnd again, it really is dependent\nupon the device that you have.\n\n292\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.530\nNow there's also tap and\nhold gestures that you can do.\n\n293\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.200\nIf I press the button,\n\n294\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.650\nlet's see if I say this-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.880\n>> And it's not gonna do it, right?\n\n296\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.960\nThere we go.\n\n297\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.510\nAnd notice how it gave me this little\nsquare because I'm tapping and holding?\n\n298\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.190\nAnd when I let go it's\nessentially the right click.\n\n299\n00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.200\nAnd now I have the ability to do\nanything that I would do with a track or\n\n300\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.070\na mouse,\nI can do here with a right-click as well.\n\n301\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.140\nAnd then I can turn around and\nif I wanted to, for instance,\n\n302\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.940\nI can select something on\nthat right-click screen.\n\n303\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.520\nIn this case,\nI just happened to maybe closed it down.\n\n304\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.860\nI thought I brought up task manager,\nbut it's thinking about it there.\n\n305\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.771\nSo, couple different ways that you could\ninteract with these touchscreens there\n\n306\n00:15:44.771 --> 00:15:48.635\ntoo, and again, keep in mind some of the\nbasics that we have been talking about.\n\n307\n00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:53.249\nWhen it comes to these screens\nI just wanna really briefly\n\n308\n00:15:53.249 --> 00:15:56.527\nmention the technologies behind them.\n\n309\n00:15:56.527 --> 00:16:00.735\nYou have two major technologies\nwhen it comes to Touchscreens.\n\n310\n00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:03.266\nYou have what is known\nas capacitive touch and\n\n311\n00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:06.110\nyou have what's known as resistive touch.\n\n312\n00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.540\nAgain, so\njust different types of touchscreens.\n\n313\n00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.407\nFor the most part when we interact with\nthem, when you're interacting with them,\n\n314\n00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.120\nwhen you're supporting somebody,\n\n315\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.230\nmost likely that's not really\ngonna make much difference to you.\n\n316\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.350\nYou just need to know the basics\non how to function and\n\n317\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.430\nwork your way through if you do\nhappen to have a touchscreen.\n\n318\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.010\n>> All right, well so\n\n319\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.120\neven though we do have things like what\nyou've just shown us on the touchscreen.\n\n320\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.390\nAnd of course the touch\npad as well as the mouse,\n\n321\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.540\nthere are other types of input devices\nout there that you may end up using.\n\n322\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.590\nNow, when you take a look\nat the idea of the mouse,\n\n323\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.400\nthat's probably the most prolific one\nthat you'll see out there in the world,\n\n324\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.860\nespecially connected to desktops.\n\n325\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.130\nThe limitation that you have there is that\nyou need a surface area to be able to\n\n326\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.880\nmove that mouse so it can do what it needs\nto do if you're doing the point and click.\n\n327\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.921\nBut sometimes you're limited by the space\nthat you have available to you and\n\n328\n00:16:56.921 --> 00:17:01.093\nthen that's when those other ones come\ninto play such as your touchscreens and\n\n329\n00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:02.752\nyour touch pads that you have.\n\n330\n00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:06.686\nThat really does limit you to what\nyou see right in front of you.\n\n331\n00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:10.670\nBut Wes, if I'm on a desktop computer\nthough and I still have that limitation of\n\n332\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.150\nspace, there is another device\nthat we could use, right?\n\n333\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.880\n>> That's right, and in fact,\nwe've already got that set up here.\n\n334\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.610\nLet's show you what\nRonnie's talking about.\n\n335\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.880\nIt's here on the desk and\n\n336\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.140\nwhat's interesting is this is\nessentially a rollerball mouse that\n\n337\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.930\nsomebody decided they were going\nto turn upside down, right.\n\n338\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.846\nYou end up having,\nthis is called a trackball and\n\n339\n00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:32.135\nwhat you have is basically just this.\n\n340\n00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.825\n>> Ball?\n\n341\n00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:35.553\n[LAUGH]\n>> The sphere, if you will, the ball.\n\n342\n00:17:35.553 --> 00:17:40.177\nAnd what it does is it has these actuator\nmotors inside that track your motion and\n\n343\n00:17:40.177 --> 00:17:42.260\nyou don't have to move your hands.\n\n344\n00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.018\nNow, I'm left handed so\nthat I couldn't use this even if it was\n\n345\n00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:50.550\na left-handed trackball but\nthis is a right-handed trackball.\n\n346\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.280\nAnd you can see that there are extra\nbuttons here for implementing things like\n\n347\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.900\nyour right clicks which bring up\noption menus on the interface.\n\n348\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.410\nThe desktop that you might be working\nwith, and again it's got also a few\n\n349\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.970\ncouple other programmable buttons\nthat might be specific to this one.\n\n350\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.187\nHowever, what is common between all\nof them is that they typically have\n\n351\n00:18:10.187 --> 00:18:14.000\nthese buttons there so\nthat you don't have to move around a lot.\n\n352\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.470\nOne of the benefits to these things,\nnow personally, I don't find a benefit.\n\n353\n00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.520\nI can't use these to save my life,\nI'm just not coordinated enough.\n\n354\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.320\nIs the fact that you don't have\nto move the mouse all around.\n\n355\n00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.855\nSo I have a friend that uses one these,\nswears by one of these\n\n356\n00:18:28.855 --> 00:18:32.790\ncuz he's got a degenerate disease in\nhis eye so he can't see very well.\n\n357\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.590\nAnd he's like, Wes, I don't have\ntime to be moving the mouse around.\n\n358\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.240\nHe goes I just need to be able to find\nmy mouse and do exactly what I need to,\n\n359\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.630\nso it benefits him in the fact that\nhe can put his hand on the mouse.\n\n360\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.360\nOr in this case the trackball and\n\n361\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.940\nas you can see you can move\nthrough the interface this way.\n\n362\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.960\nNow I keep mentioning that mechanical\nroller ball mouse and it's legacy.\n\n363\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.900\nSo I didn't know if I was really\ngonna bring it up here, but\n\n364\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.460\nsince we talked it about it enough,\nI figure we'll go ahead and show it.\n\n365\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.990\nSo this is on my computer here, and\n\n366\n00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.010\nyou can see the case of\nthe old roller ball mouse.\n\n367\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.290\nAnd Ronnie, I know that you've\nprobably had to clean one or\n\n368\n00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.980\ntwo of these in your lifetime here.\n\n369\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.420\nThese, you can see the roller\nball in the middle, right?\n\n370\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.920\nAnd that's what I was saying how you\ncan see that the trackball is probably,\n\n371\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.280\nkind of like taking that and\nturning it upside down.\n\n372\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.760\nAnd the principle is now that what you're\ndoing is you're actually using that\n\n373\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.880\nball to manipulate the movement\nversus grabbing the mouse and\n\n374\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.410\nthe ball rolls as you move the mouse.\n\n375\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.510\nAnd you can see these motors in here,\nin fact right there you can see one of\n\n376\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.840\nthe motors and it tracks the scroll wheel\nfor scrolling through web pages and stuff.\n\n377\n00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.360\nDepending on what\ninterface you might be in.\n\n378\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:43.750\nSo couple of different ways that you\ncan interact with your machine here.\n\n379\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.006\nBut we do got a couple other things\nthat we want to look at as it\n\n380\n00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:50.802\ncomes to peripherals that I do believe,\nI think that are important.\n\n381\n00:19:50.802 --> 00:19:52.566\nAnd Ronnie, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n382\n00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.610\nI'm going to kind of change up\nthe order here a little bit.\n\n383\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.980\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ntalk about the fax and\n\n384\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.210\nthe scanners because we did\ntalk about the printers.\n\n385\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.790\nAnd I probably should have put this\nin with the printers here, guys.\n\n386\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.220\nBut printers is one of\nthe most common things here.\n\n387\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.820\nLet's go ahead and let's take a second and\n\n388\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.340\nlet's talk a little bit about\nanother oldie but goodie.\n\n389\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.730\nThat's been around for awhile, and\nthat's called the fax machine.\n\n390\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.190\nAnd it could be something that's\nconnected externally to a computer.\n\n391\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.610\nIt might be something that it's not\nconnected to the computer at all.\n\n392\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.840\nIt could be just connected to a straight\nphone line but, let's go ahead and\n\n393\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.640\nbring that up too.\n\n394\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.830\nSo, you could have one of\nthese old fax machines.\n\n395\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.940\nI'll tell you,\nmore common than not today, is an MFD.\n\n396\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.850\nSorry for the alphabet soup here, again,\nthat's called, a multi-functioning device,\n\n397\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.350\nthat just really blends the printer,\nthe scanner and the fax all in one.\n\n398\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.850\nBut you can't really say in computing\nnever because you might come across these.\n\n399\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.230\nThis is a way that you can\nsend electronic messages.\n\n400\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.700\nKind of like we do in texting,\n\n401\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.020\na little bit different though because\nit combines kind of like a text.\n\n402\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.910\nAnd a printer all in one, and you can send\nit over a telephone line if you will.\n\n403\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.520\nThe next one we have is the scanner, and\n\n404\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.260\nscanner this is one of the old flatbed\nscanners with the old flatbed scanner now.\n\n405\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:12.280\nThis is a device, again another input\ndevice, that allows you to create,\n\n406\n00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.920\nphotographic copies,\nduplicates if you will.\n\n407\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.010\nHigh resolution copies of\npretty much any document.\n\n408\n00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:26.800\nAnd you lay your media that you need\nto get scanned, down on this flat bed.\n\n409\n00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.530\nIt's got a light and\nit's got these stepper motors much like\n\n410\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.400\nan inkjet printer does,\nwhere it pulls a light and\n\n411\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.070\nscans the entirety of the media that\nis presented on that flatbed there.\n\n412\n00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:42.940\nSo definitely want to mention that\none as something that you might see.\n\n413\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.040\nNow, we do have a couple other ones that\nwe want to look at a little bit here that\n\n414\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.020\nyou are probably going to run into today.\n\n415\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.910\nSpecially if you're in\nan environment where you know\n\n416\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.830\ninstant messaging and\nteleconferencing is important.\n\n417\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.570\nSo we do wanna make you aware of these two\nand I have actually got one right here and\n\n418\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.190\nthis is a web cam.\n\n419\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.860\nLet me get that into the screen there and\n\n420\n00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.640\nyou can see that this is a USB based\nweb cam, see the USB plug there.\n\n421\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.860\nAnd this is one that again\ngives you the video input.\n\n422\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.950\nVideo in, audio input for that matter,\nthere's a little microphone.\n\n423\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.820\nGoing on these and again, you can use\nthese for things like teleconferencing,\n\n424\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.000\nif you're doing Skype calls out there.\n\n425\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.750\nAgain, this is something that can\nallow you that functionality,\n\n426\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.350\nit might be something\nthat you're supporting.\n\n427\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.090\nBut it would definitely be something\nthat I would be aware of in any kind of\n\n428\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.000\ncomputing industry cuz you never know when\nyou might have to support one of these.\n\n429\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.340\nKeep in mind that there are,\n\n430\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.940\neveryone is unique to itself,\neven within the same manufacturer.\n\n431\n00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.760\nThis just happens to be a Logitech brand\nand they make many, many different\n\n432\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.180\nkinds and you need different software and\ndrivers for each one.\n\n433\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.770\nSo pay attention to these\nbecause of the fact that they\n\n434\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.180\nmost likely are gonna need a driver.\n\n435\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.640\nAnd I didn't mention the fact, Ronnie,\n\n436\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.830\nthat probably the trackball\nmight need a driver as well.\n\n437\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.730\nGood thing today, with us today is we got\na technology called Plug and Play, and\n\n438\n00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.870\nwith these external peripherals that\nwe've been talking about a lot of times.\n\n439\n00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.520\nEspecially we need this USB and\nyou plug them into the computer,\n\n440\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.060\na lot of times the computers are good\nto recognize them, their cells.\n\n441\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.240\nNow the other one that I kinda wanna\nmention here as well, one of the last ones\n\n442\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.360\nthat we have to actually show\nhere is the fingerprint scanner.\n\n443\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.970\nYou never know when you might be\nsupporting things like security, and\n\n444\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.230\nthat's what this boils down to.\n\n445\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.770\nThis makes your computer or\n\n446\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.910\nyour device that you're using it with\na little bit more secure because rather\n\n447\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.530\nthan having to type in some characters\non your keyboard and hit Enter.\n\n448\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.070\nTo get into the machine you can use\njust by swiping your finger across this.\n\n449\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.170\nYou can use what is known as biometrics.\n\n450\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.246\nYou can just think of it as a security\nprecaution that uses your fingerprint and\n\n451\n00:23:48.246 --> 00:23:50.670\nI can actually get into\nmy computer like that.\n\n452\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.155\nAnd if somebody else is sitting at my\ncomputer, well hopefully they haven't gone\n\n453\n00:23:55.155 --> 00:23:59.260\nMission Impossible and got like wax\nprints of my fingerprints if you will.\n\n454\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.018\nThey can't get in here, so\nit does strengthen the security,\n\n455\n00:24:02.018 --> 00:24:04.310\nit is something that you\nmight see as a peripheral.\n\n456\n00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.680\nCouple more, let's see Ronnie,\nwhat else do we got?\n\n457\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.030\nI do wanna mention audio.\n\n458\n00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.100\nAudio, this is a little bit different than\nwhat we've been talking about because\n\n459\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.890\nof the fact that we've been\ntalking about input devices.\n\n460\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.270\nIn the first part of this episode\nwe talked about output devices.\n\n461\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.210\nWell, this is one that could\nprobably be along that same line.\n\n462\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.880\nSpeakers are audio output devices.\n\n463\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.697\nAnd when we get into looking\nat more of the connections,\n\n464\n00:24:31.697 --> 00:24:36.923\nwe'll show you just a little\nbit of that and we'll basically\n\n465\n00:24:36.923 --> 00:24:42.887\nshow you the connectors,\nthe TRS jacks that connect to the machine.\n\n466\n00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:47.011\nBasically, guys, speakers, they come in\nall different shapes and sizes and colors.\n\n467\n00:24:47.011 --> 00:24:51.001\nIt is nothing more than a device that\nallows you to listen to the audio\n\n468\n00:24:51.001 --> 00:24:53.670\noutput that's coming out of your computer.\n\n469\n00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.180\nOne last one that I might mention, again,\n\n470\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.970\nis microphones and joy sticks,\nright, joy sticks for games.\n\n471\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.730\nAgain, they can have different connections\ntoday, especially in the PC market,\n\n472\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.910\nthey're gonna be USB based.\n\n473\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.280\nYou plug them in, might be wireless.\n\n474\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.030\nHowever, with gaming,\ntake my advice on this.\n\n475\n00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.530\nGaming, a lot of times they like wired\nconnections because they have a lot less\n\n476\n00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.325\ndelay, so they give a better performance.\n\n477\n00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:24.240\nYeah, I think that has just about got it.\n\n478\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.780\nThere are a couple other things\nthat I want you to keep in mind,\n\n479\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.900\nand just as a recap,\nremember the connections.\n\n480\n00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.120\nPrimary connections with\nthis is gonna be wireless,\n\n481\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.170\nUSB, PS2, and\njust know where those connections are.\n\n482\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:42.310\nYou usually find them on the front of\na computer, the system unit that we were\n\n483\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.040\ntalking about, the tower, or\nyou could find them on the back.\n\n484\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.932\nA lot of times you could find both of\nthem,depending on your motherboard itself.\n\n485\n00:25:48.932 --> 00:25:51.953\nBut that is a big thing to keep in\nmind that when you're gonna use\n\n486\n00:25:51.953 --> 00:25:56.171\nthese input devices, if you're supporting\nthe end user, it's about their choice and\n\n487\n00:25:56.171 --> 00:25:59.249\ntheir preference,\nnot about your choice and your preference,\n\n488\n00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:01.600\ncuz remember it's not\nyou using that computer.\n\n489\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.151\nFor instance,\nI can't stand the trackball but\n\n490\n00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:07.738\nwe've got some people around here\nthat love the trackball right.\n\n491\n00:26:07.738 --> 00:26:09.815\nAnd there's nothing wrong with\nthat because that's why we\n\n492\n00:26:09.815 --> 00:26:11.310\ncall it personal computing.\n\n493\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:15.050\nSo keep in mind the connections, keep\nin mind the batteries if it's wireless,\n\n494\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.130\nkeep in mind specialty\ndrivers if you need them.\n\n495\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.670\nRemember the driver if you,\nfirst time you've heard that and\n\n496\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.660\nyou haven't watched some of the other\nepisodes, that component that allows our\n\n497\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.130\noperating system to talk to that device,\nit is important.\n\n498\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.590\nSo those are some of the things that\nyou should probably be aware of\n\n499\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.210\nwhen you have to maybe either support or\ntroubleshoot these.\n\n500\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.160\n>> When we start taking a look at\ndifferent types of peripherals\n\n501\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.540\nthat we have been talking about, remember\nto keep it in the context that you need.\n\n502\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.340\nA lot of times in the work environment,\n\n503\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.370\nmore than likely it's\ngonna be that keyboard and\n\n504\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.950\nthat mouse that you need to be familiar\nwith and feel comfortable with in using.\n\n505\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.490\nSo make sure you do pay attention there\nand learn how to actually use those.\n\n506\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.470\nTyping is a great skill that I\ndo recommend that you have if\n\n507\n00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.530\nyou're doing this.\n\n508\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.740\nBut you might be wondering when am I gonna\nactually ever encounter some of these\n\n509\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.460\nother types of devices?\n\n510\n00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.010\nWell, it depends on the situation.\n\n511\n00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.290\nIf you are in a laptop situation\nwhere somebody has said,\n\n512\n00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.460\nhere is what you're gonna work from which\nis a notebook or a laptop, it might be\n\n513\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.310\na touchscreen, it might be that idea of\nthat touchpad or even that TrackPoint.\n\n514\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.486\nOr they may even give you just a very\nsmall area in which they give you\n\n515\n00:27:16.486 --> 00:27:19.294\na trackball,\nyou should become familiar with those too.\n\n516\n00:27:19.294 --> 00:27:22.577\nBut there are highly specialized\ntypes of application that\n\n517\n00:27:22.577 --> 00:27:24.939\nyou might end up using\nthat do require you,\n\n518\n00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:29.419\nalso, to be able to use the webcam, as\nwell as the speakers and the microphones.\n\n519\n00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:32.955\nThe great thing about those is most of\nthe time, you don't have to set them up,\n\n520\n00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:34.530\nespecially on a laptop.\n\n521\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.580\nThey're pre-built into\nthe actual device itself and\n\n522\n00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.860\nnormally, if you need to use\nthose to get them set up,\n\n523\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.610\nwhatever program you're using\nwill have a configuration wizard.\n\n524\n00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.060\nIn other words, it will guide you\nthrough step-by-step to ensure\n\n525\n00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.700\nthat you have set it up correctly\nto use that program as well.\n\n526\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.699\nSo if you feel like that this is a bit\noverwhelming because there's a ton of\n\n527\n00:27:56.699 --> 00:28:00.829\ndifferent things, the great thing is\ncomputing has come to this point where\n\n528\n00:28:00.829 --> 00:28:04.401\nthey realize that and that they\ncan actually help you out as well.\n\n529\n00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:07.221\n>> One of the last things that I do wanna\nmention is I do wanna take just a couple\n\n530\n00:28:07.221 --> 00:28:09.605\nminutes here and show you some\nof the different connections.\n\n531\n00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:12.664\nSince we're talking about peripherals and\nwe're talking about displays,\n\n532\n00:28:12.664 --> 00:28:13.369\nlet me go ahead and\n\n533\n00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:15.970\nshow you some of this connections\non our machine here real quick.\n\n534\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.255\nNow, I know my head's kinda\ncovering up one of them there but\n\n535\n00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:21.040\nthese are the primary interfaces\nthat we see today, the cords,\n\n536\n00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.530\nthe cables that you plug from the back\nof your computer into the monitors.\n\n537\n00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.590\nYou could see an older one here,\nVGA, and its connector there.\n\n538\n00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.230\nThis is an analog signal,\nbasically a lower quality signal and\n\n539\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.310\nthen as time went on,\nwe got the what's known as DVI cable So\n\n540\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.840\npay attention to those,\nagain, this is important.\n\n541\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.560\nWe also have the HDMI connector there.\n\n542\n00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.860\nThe HDMI connector is for\nhigh definition, in fact, it stands for\n\n543\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.690\nhigh definition multimedia interface.\n\n544\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.800\nSo it's a very high quality, high\nresolution that's capable of producing\n\n545\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.960\nsound and video, or sending sound and\nvideo over the same cable.\n\n546\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.140\nSo that's one of the great\nthings about it.\n\n547\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.100\nCouple of the other ones that we\nhave that I wanna go ahead and\n\n548\n00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.760\njust mention here since we're\ntalking about peripherals.\n\n549\n00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.400\nWe have display port,\nyou could see that one as well.\n\n550\n00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.100\nAnd it looks a lot like that SATA\nconnector that we'll talk about when\n\n551\n00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.030\nit comes up, when we talk\nabout storage and hard drives.\n\n552\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.670\nAnd then Thunderbolt,\nThunderbolt's out there as well\n\n553\n00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.175\nand one of the things that I think\nis interesting is be careful with\n\n554\n00:29:19.175 --> 00:29:23.750\nthese because that is also a mini-display\nport that I have right here.\n\n555\n00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.580\nAnd if you'll notice up here this\nis the Thunderbolt connector and\n\n556\n00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.889\nthey look a lot alike.\n\n557\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.800\nThey do work with each other but\ntechnically they are different,\n\n558\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.790\nso keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.410\nSo we do have a couple of those.\n\n560\n00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.410\nAll right, and here are the various\nconnectors that I had mentioned earlier.\n\n561\n00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.430\nThese are some of the connectors\nyou can see in peripheral devices,\n\n562\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.510\nyour FireWire connector here, that big box\nthere, that's an older one, that was for\n\n563\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.730\nthe older FireWire 800 standard.\n\n564\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.530\nAnd then these are more of your common\nFireWire standards that you'll see in\n\n565\n00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.330\nthe back of the machine.\n\n566\n00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.650\nSee a little bullet shaped\nconnector there and\n\n567\n00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.250\nyou'll also see a little\nsquare box connector.\n\n568\n00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.860\nAnd then a slew and I can't tell you how\nmany of them, in fact, six of them to\n\n569\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:10.020\nbe exact, there are when it comes to USB\nand there's different standards here.\n\n570\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.960\nAll the way on the left you\nhave the micro standards.\n\n571\n00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.575\nI'm not sure exactly what this one right\nhere is but then you have the mini so\n\n572\n00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:19.976\nwe got micro and mini.\n\n573\n00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:24.795\nYou see the micros, our charging\ncables for phones commonly as well,\n\n574\n00:30:24.795 --> 00:30:27.664\nbut they also plug in different devices.\n\n575\n00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:31.067\nAnd then you have A devices and\nwe have a female and a male version here,\n\n576\n00:30:31.067 --> 00:30:34.600\nthe male version with the post,\nthe female with the port there.\n\n577\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.840\nAnd then last but not least, you have\na what's known as a type B connector which\n\n578\n00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.160\nis commonly associated\nwith USB-based printers.\n\n579\n00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.689\nSo we definitely want to know that.\n\n580\n00:30:42.689 --> 00:30:45.478\nBut those are a couple of the peripheral\nconnections that I did wanna show in\n\n581\n00:30:45.478 --> 00:30:46.150\nthere, Ronnie.\n\n582\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.162\nI thought we might save them for another\nepisode but this is a great place since\n\n583\n00:30:49.162 --> 00:30:52.330\nwe're talking about displays and\nwe're talking about external connections.\n\n584\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.057\nIt is good to know what connections\nyou need when you're gonna support\n\n585\n00:30:55.057 --> 00:30:56.180\nthose devices.\n\n586\n00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.240\n>> All right, well that's a great place\nfor us to also end this episode then.\n\n587\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.030\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wang.\n\n588\n00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.120\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n589\n00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.211\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n590\n00:31:10.211 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.055\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:21.522\nyou're watching the IC 3\ncomputing fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.074\nWhere we're about to take a look\ninto the realm of storage.\n\n6\n00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:28.080\nNow, Wes actually hasn't described\nanything else to me except for\n\n7\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570\nthe title of the episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.600\nSo Wes, what are we taking a look at\ntoday and welcome back to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.630\n>> Well, thanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.165\nThat's right.\n\n11\n00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:37.887\nWe're gonna talk about,\nwe've been talking about data, right?\n\n12\n00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:42.715\nData, and that's the purpose of our\nentire computing experience, right?\n\n13\n00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:43.825\nInformation systems.\n\n14\n00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:46.055\nBeing able to move data\nfrom point A to point B,\n\n15\n00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.980\nwhen we talk about it at\nthe hardware level, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.550\nWell, where does that data end up?\n\n17\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.230\nWe've talked in an earlier episode\nthat if it was in memory volatile,\n\n18\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.720\nvolatile memory it needs\nan electrical current.\n\n19\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.400\nAnd if we pull the plug,\nthat unfortunately that data's gone.\n\n20\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.420\nSo we need a place in where\nwe can store our data.\n\n21\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.040\nAnd the type of storage mediums that\nwe've been using over the last 20,\n\n22\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.020\n30 years has definitely changed.\n\n23\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.960\nSo we're gonna be looking at some\nof the storage devices that you can\n\n24\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.330\nsee inside of your systems, and\nmaybe even outside of your systems,\n\n25\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.855\nwhen it comes to what's most important.\n\n26\n00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:24.090\nThe data that you need to\nmake sure that you preserve.\n\n27\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.380\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntalk a little bit about that.\n\n28\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.400\nWe've got a few different\ntypes of storage.\n\n29\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.500\nOne of the big ones that is very,\nvery common inside of systems today,\n\n30\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.550\nis what's known as a hard disk drive.\n\n31\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.910\nNow, hard disk drive,\nwhat does that mean for us?\n\n32\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.060\nWell, that is a place that\nallows us to store our data and\n\n33\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.340\nretain that data for use at a later time,\neven if the computer has been powered off.\n\n34\n00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550\nAnd we have a few different\ntypes that we wanna look at.\n\n35\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.790\nBut before we look at the different types,\n\n36\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.360\nthere is a commonality to\nthese different types.\n\n37\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.820\nAnd that is the internal\nnature of these drives.\n\n38\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.920\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n39\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.970\nIf we look at what the drive consists of,\nright.\n\n40\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.870\nIf we were to pop one of these open here,\n\n41\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.010\nyou could see that it contains\na series of platters right.\n\n42\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.900\nYou can see this arm, kind of like\nthe old record player needle, right.\n\n43\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.380\nAs you would play a record, right,\n\n44\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.690\nthat needle would go farther and\nfarther and farther across the record.\n\n45\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.220\nWhile it's really not too much different\nin concept when you look at the internal\n\n46\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.050\nworkings of a hard disk drive.\n\n47\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.620\nRight, when I decide that inside of\nthe operating system I wanna click save.\n\n48\n00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.670\nWell, depending on where I save it,\na lot of times,\n\n49\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.590\ncommonly it's gonna be\non one of these drives.\n\n50\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.930\nNow what happens when we need\nto find that information?\n\n51\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040\nWell this armature and these planners\nis what helps us retrieve, and\n\n52\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.260\nnot only retrieve but store,\nthat information likewise too.\n\n53\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.670\nAnd that actuator arm as it's called,\nthat little arm that looks like,\n\n54\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.630\nkinda like,\nagain kinda like a record player needle.\n\n55\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.440\nAnd you could see that it's very, very\nclose to the surface of those platters,\n\n56\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.810\nand it uses magnets if you will.\n\n57\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.820\nIt's what's known as a magnetic media,\n\n58\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.210\nit uses electromagnetic pulses to\nstore and retrieve the information.\n\n59\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.140\nSo that's one of the things you gotta keep\nin mind with these hard drives is they\n\n60\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.440\nare sensitive to magnetic shock,\nif you will.\n\n61\n00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.370\nYou certainly don't wanna\nbe putting magnets over,\n\n62\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.200\nin fact that's the way they erase a lot\nof the storage data that's on them.\n\n63\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.932\nSo again, as the technology has\nprogressed, you can get more and\n\n64\n00:03:21.932 --> 00:03:23.147\nmore platters.\n\n65\n00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:27.610\nWhat the traditional trend has been is\nyou start to see the fact that these\n\n66\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820\ncapacities get larger and larger.\n\n67\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.760\nWhat I mean by capacities is,\nthink of a basket, right.\n\n68\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.694\nThe bigger the basket, the more stuff\nI can put in the basket, right.\n\n69\n00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:39.127\nWell as the capacity grows\nwithin these hard disk drives,\n\n70\n00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:41.800\nI get the ability to\nstore more information.\n\n71\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.450\nAnd we're gonna look, coming up, at some\nof the different types of those drives.\n\n72\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.810\n>> So Wes, let's talk about that\nidea of capacity just for a moment.\n\n73\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.600\nSo when somebody goes and picks up a hard\ndrive or they tell me that they have a 500\n\n74\n00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.110\ngig hard drive, I really don't\nknow what that ends up meaning.\n\n75\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.640\nSo, what do we normally talk\nabout when we start talking about\n\n76\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.090\nthe term like gigabytes or\nmegabytes or anything like that.\n\n77\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.380\n>> Sure, that's a measurement right.\n\n78\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.230\nIt's no different than if we\nwere to say inches, feet, miles,\n\n79\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.960\nright, it's how we measure distance.\n\n80\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.590\nWell, there's a way that we measure how\nmuch we have in that basket, right.\n\n81\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.150\nI need to know that something's\nthe size of an apple,\n\n82\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.460\nhow many apples can I get in there right,\nversus I can get one watermelon, right?\n\n83\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.190\nSo there's different size\nof what can be in there.\n\n84\n00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210\nSo let's talk about those measurements\nthat we use inside of storage, right?\n\n85\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.730\nOne of the smaller ones, smallest ones\nwhat we have are what is known as bytes,\n\n86\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.360\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.970\nAnd when we look at a byte of data, right?\n\n88\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.640\nThat's broken up to even smaller\namounts of data called bits, right?\n\n89\n00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.017\nBit by bit, you might have heard that\nterm, if you haven't well now you have.\n\n90\n00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:48.230\nAnd eight bits of data\nbecome a byte right.\n\n91\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.408\nThen we go up in to megabytes,\nthat's the next if you will,\n\n92\n00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:55.762\na thousand bits I believe it is,\nis a megabyte.\n\n93\n00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:56.790\n>> Kilobyte.\n\n94\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.430\n>> Kilobyte, that's right,\nI've completely forgot about kilobytes.\n\n95\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.211\nA kilobyte, megabyte and\nthen gigabyte, and\n\n96\n00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:04.570\nwhat you see is the amount of capacity.\n\n97\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.120\nOnce you get into gigabytes, right,\n\n98\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.320\nnow we're talking about 1\ngigabyte is 1000 megabytes right?\n\n99\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.380\nIf we talk about 1000 kilobytes,\nthat's 1 megabyte.\n\n100\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.097\nAnd it goes on and on and on up the scale\nuntil you eventually you get in to what\n\n101\n00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:21.755\nare known as terabytes, right?\n\n102\n00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:23.280\nWell what's a terabyte?\n\n103\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.460\nWell that is 1,000 gigabytes.\n\n104\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.900\nSo when you look at\nthe capacity of the drive,\n\n105\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.980\nyou have to make a choice if\nyou're gonna be supporting it,\n\n106\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.590\nsupporting somebody on how\nthey're gonna use their system.\n\n107\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.682\nSo those measurements and that concept\nthat Ronnie's mentioning here is very\n\n108\n00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:42.841\nimportant to understand if I have a lot\nof high definition files today, right.\n\n109\n00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.350\nLet's talk about video.\n\n110\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.820\nWell, if you're storing stuff in very,\n\n111\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.270\nvery high resolution, that's like putting\none of the watermelons in the basket.\n\n112\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.857\nYou might not be able to get so\nmuch in there, right.\n\n113\n00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:56.930\nVersus something that\nlet's say is just text.\n\n114\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.240\nText would be like taking,\nI don't know like a peanut, and\n\n115\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.420\nthrowing it in the basket.\n\n116\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.490\nWell, you can probably get a lot\nof peanuts in those baskets.\n\n117\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.064\nSo the different measurements\nfrom bit to byte, to kilobyte,\n\n118\n00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:10.850\n[LAUGH] thank you,\nto megabyte, then gigabyte, and\n\n119\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.040\nthen terabyte is just how much\ninformation you can store.\n\n120\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.820\nRonnie mentioned 500 gigs.\n\n121\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.420\n500 we say gigs sometimes.\n\n122\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.145\nGigabyte.\n\n123\n00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.695\nThat is a common drive size today.\n\n124\n00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:22.785\nAnd it's kinda interesting.\n\n125\n00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:27.625\nThat's actually considered almost on\nthe small end today for drive sizes.\n\n126\n00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:29.662\nUnless you're talking\nabout little laptops and\n\n127\n00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:33.210\nstuff where there's not a lot of space\nto put very big drives in there.\n\n128\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.840\nYou're seeing today commonly is\nterabyte drives and that's 1,000 gigs.\n\n129\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.954\nSo, what you want to keep in mind\nis that if you're purchasing or\n\n130\n00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:44.241\nyou're replacing a drive,\nlook at what the specification says and\n\n131\n00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.927\nthen look at what the capacity is.\n\n132\n00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:50.382\nCuz those are two things that are gonna\nbe your dealbreakers as to whether you're\n\n133\n00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:54.182\ngoing to buy an efficient drive,\none that's gonna suit the needs for\n\n134\n00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:54.980\na little bit.\n\n135\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.369\nIf I go out and I was to buy, let's say,\none of the older 250 gig drives,\n\n136\n00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.646\nwell just in a certain folder\nthat I have on my computer,\n\n137\n00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.693\nI could fill it up with one folder.\n\n138\n00:07:04.693 --> 00:07:09.599\nVersus something that's larger in size\nlike a terabyte which is a thousand gigs,\n\n139\n00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.809\nI could definitely put a lot more\ninformation in one of those devices.\n\n140\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.540\nAll right, now, if you're ever having\nto work with some of these devices,\n\n141\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.020\nif you have to work with\nthe hard disk drives,\n\n142\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.650\nyou might come,\nencounter a couple of different types.\n\n143\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.736\nAnd now we're not so much talking\nabout the capacity of the drive, but\n\n144\n00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.800\nwe're talking about at the physical level.\n\n145\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.330\nIf I was to break the drive out, or\nif I was to open up the computer case,\n\n146\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.560\nwhat am I gonna see?\n\n147\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.210\nWhat am I gonna need to know if\nI need to replace that drive?\n\n148\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.420\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n149\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.460\nWe've got two of the common\ndrives that you'll see today.\n\n150\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.660\nAnd I say common, this first one is\na little bit older of a drive, right?\n\n151\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.989\nThis is what's known as\nthe earlier parallel ATA drives.\n\n152\n00:07:53.989 --> 00:07:58.923\nAnd I put them in here because you\ncan't say that you won't see them.\n\n153\n00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:02.764\nJust because we've moved on to this next\none that we'll talk about, Serial ATA,\n\n154\n00:08:02.764 --> 00:08:05.548\nand that's become really\nthe dominant technology today,\n\n155\n00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:08.180\ndoesn't mean that you won't\nstill see these old ones.\n\n156\n00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.740\nNow I kinda wanna look at\nthis drive a little bit, so\n\n157\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.430\nyou can get an idea what's going on.\n\n158\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.533\nIf we zoom in here, you'll see that\nthis is the back of the drive, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:20.044\nAnd there's a series of pins on this side,\nthere's some pins here, and\n\n160\n00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:21.550\nthen there's four pins here.\n\n161\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.940\nWell what are all those pins about?\n\n162\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.179\nWell, this is actually where\nsomething known as a data cable goes.\n\n163\n00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:31.448\nRemember, when we're talking about\nwanting to put something in the basket or\n\n164\n00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:33.981\nwanting to put something\non the drive itself?\n\n165\n00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.701\nWell, we need a way and\nwe need a pipeline if you will,\n\n166\n00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:42.252\nwe need a highway to store that\ninformation in the drive itself and\n\n167\n00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:47.740\nthese series of pins that you have here\nare all relative to this cable, right?\n\n168\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.800\nThis is one of those drives cables, right?\n\n169\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.090\nThe PATA drive you might hear it called,\nparallel ATA drive.\n\n170\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.122\nAnd again, it's just the technology and\nthe type of interface.\n\n171\n00:08:57.122 --> 00:09:00.898\nIt's a relatively older technology,\nit's been around for a while so\n\n172\n00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:02.930\nit does have some limitations.\n\n173\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.040\nThe drive sizes can't get very large\nlike they can the newer interface\n\n174\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.660\nthat we'll look at.\n\n175\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.570\nBut I do put it here for\n\n176\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.130\nthe sake that just in case you see them,\nyou will be aware of them.\n\n177\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.730\nTheir power cable, that little four\npin connector that I was showing here,\n\n178\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.690\nwell, we've seen this in another episode.\n\n179\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.230\nThis is the Molex connector and\nthis is where you would plug it in,\n\n180\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.700\nyou plug it into those\nfour pins right there.\n\n181\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.980\nNow, not only do these drives\nhave certain limitations,\n\n182\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.880\nthere's a reason that technology advanced\nand we kind of abandoned this technology,\n\n183\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.550\nis because it took a lot of configuration.\n\n184\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.910\nYou had to know something about\nthe configuration when you put a couple of\n\n185\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.970\nthese drives in, and\nif you didn't know the configuration,\n\n186\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.390\nthe drives weren't gonna work.\n\n187\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.380\nAnd that configuration was what that\nlittle block that you see right there,\n\n188\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.570\nlooks like a little fuse, and I would just\npull that off and I'd have to put this in\n\n189\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.520\na certain arrangement in order to make\nmultiple drives communicate together.\n\n190\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.090\nSo again, it did have its limitations,\n\n191\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.300\nit did have some drawbacks in the fact\nthat if you didn't configure it right,\n\n192\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.360\nunfortunately you wouldn't be having\na good day at the office, all right.\n\n193\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.110\nThere's also limitation on\nthe size of those cables as well.\n\n194\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd again that fat ribbon\ncable that you see and wide,\n\n195\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.550\nthey're very hard to deal with inside\nof the case, can cause things like\n\n196\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.480\nair obstructions if you will,\nthe airflow inside of the case so.\n\n197\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.490\nThe next one that came along and\n\n198\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.970\nessentially the replacement is what's\nknown at the serial ATA or SATA drive.\n\n199\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.540\nAnd these are the ones that are common\nthat you're going to find today.\n\n200\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.500\nAnd I went ahead and put both formats.\n\n201\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.070\nRemember we've been talking just on and\noff about form factor.\n\n202\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.790\nWell, with the hard drives guys,\n\n203\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.380\nit's not as complex as like\nmotherboard form factors.\n\n204\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.600\nThat means a whole bunch of things, right.\n\n205\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.920\nForm factors on the drives just\nmean how wide the drive is.\n\n206\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.690\nSo in this case, you'll notice that\nthe connectors are a little bit different.\n\n207\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.920\nAnd we can zoom in here really good,\nand we can see these connectors.\n\n208\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.860\nNotice that they've got a blade\nsized connector, right?\n\n209\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.180\nYou can see two right here,\n\n210\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.480\nwell this big, large one right there,\nthat's your power connector, right?\n\n211\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.720\nThat's what's actually powering the drive.\n\n212\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.450\nAnd it's considerably different than\nthe earlier technologies we see that have\n\n213\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.110\nthose four pins on them.\n\n214\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.460\nAnd then the smaller L type\nblade here if you will,\n\n215\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.680\nthat's gonna be connected\nto our data cable.\n\n216\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.010\nYou'll notice right here,\nnotice this blade type, right.\n\n217\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.020\nIf I'm gonna use one of these\nserial ATA or SATA drives,\n\n218\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.580\nthe data cable has to be plugged into the\nsame kind of connector on the motherboard,\n\n219\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.380\nand on the back of the storage device,\nor in this case, the hard drive itself.\n\n220\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.660\nNow how about that bigger power\ncable that I was telling you about?\n\n221\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.850\nWell here's the power cable right?\n\n222\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.860\nAnd you could see one of the great\nthings about this as you don't\n\n223\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.880\nreally have to worry.\n\n224\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.880\nNo, I say that you could probably mess\nthis up, but it would take some doing,\n\n225\n00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.590\nbecause of the way the L shape is,\nit's kind of got an arrangement.\n\n226\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:12:00.320\nSo, it's not too easy to put this on or,\nhow do I wanna say this?\n\n227\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.640\nIt's, you don't have to worry\nabout getting them crossed or\n\n228\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.620\nbackwards if you will.\n\n229\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.390\nNow that being said, I just wanted to\ngo ahead and show you a comparison.\n\n230\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.570\nNow, with these being,\nlooking like the same size,\n\n231\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.840\nthis is actually a 2.5 inch drive,\nall right.\n\n232\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.160\nAnd one of the things\nthat you might notice,\n\n233\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.550\nis that the connectors\nare pretty much the same.\n\n234\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.210\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.020\nWhen it comes to connecting\nthese in the machines.\n\n236\n00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.560\nNow the two inch drives are found in\nsome common scenarios, all right.\n\n237\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.130\nThe smaller drive is found in laptops,\nwhere we still need the same technology,\n\n238\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.330\nget all the same benefits,\nfaster speeds, higher drive capacities,\n\n239\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.050\nkinda like Ronnie was mentioning\nwith the measurements there.\n\n240\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.720\nThis is where we started getting into\nhundreds of gigabytes, thousands of\n\n241\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.690\ngigabytes, which is a terrabyte, and\neven on, and so on, and so forth.\n\n242\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.100\nThey get,\nsome of them are getting very large today.\n\n243\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.250\nSo you get the benefits of speed,\nyou get the benefits of capacity.\n\n244\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.610\nNow I will tell you that with both\nof these drives there's another\n\n245\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.740\ncharacteristic of them\nthat they both share.\n\n246\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.260\nAnd that is what's known as\na mechanical drive, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.670\nMechanical drive just basically means\nthat it's got moving components in it.\n\n248\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.860\nAnd you're gonna want to make sure that\nthese drives stay stationary and certainly\n\n249\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.640\nyou're not dropping them on the ground\ncuz they don't really do well with drops.\n\n250\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.750\nThe other one that I mentioned I don't\nknow that too much that you're gonna see\n\n251\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.280\nthis in normal computing,\n\n252\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.060\nif you get into the server environment\nmaybe like we talked about some of\n\n253\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.270\nthe device types it’s rare that you're\ngonna see this in the desktops.\n\n254\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.240\nBut, I do want to just mention it, because\nit's out there, and, it's called Scuzzy.\n\n255\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.260\nIt's a fast, expensive interface,\n\n256\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.180\na lot of times you'd find it in\nenterprise-based environments.\n\n257\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.750\nAnd, there's all different\ntypes of connectors for it.\n\n258\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.120\nI didn't put in here just because\nof the fact that it's not a really\n\n259\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.520\nelementary type drive.\n\n260\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.840\nIt's something that's more advanced and\n\n261\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.000\nit's something that you'll typically\nsee inside of business, all right.\n\n262\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.050\nNow, the other that is legacy here and\nI know Ronnie,\n\n263\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.810\nI kinda jump the order here is\nfloppy disk or floppy drive.\n\n264\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.030\nI wanted to go ahead and mention it, it's\nbeen around for a while, I don't know,\n\n265\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.060\nit's considered legacy.\n\n266\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.630\nAnd I know, guys, I kinda throw that\nterm legacy out there without ever\n\n267\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.590\neven defining it to you or for you and\nthat you just assuming that you know it.\n\n268\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.420\nLegacy just means something\nthat we don't use anymore and\n\n269\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.290\nwe rarely see,\ndoesn't mean that it doesn't exist.\n\n270\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.320\nIt doesn't mean that you might not,\nyou might have a system that's old.\n\n271\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.640\nIt's only running one piece of software\nthat doesn't need to get updated.\n\n272\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.770\nAnd in that aspect,\nyou might see one of these.\n\n273\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.390\nBut outside of maybe a history museum,\n\n274\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.370\nI don't know too much that you're going\nto be working with these anymore.\n\n275\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.820\nAnd these are for the older three and\na half inch floppy disks.\n\n276\n00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.840\nAgain, another storage medium and I just\nput it here for the sake of completion.\n\n277\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.510\nNow, these all are, these drives\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n278\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.040\nthese storage device if you will.\n\n279\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.050\nThese have another characteristic\nthat they share as well,\n\n280\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.790\nthese are called internal drives,\nwell, what does that mean?\n\n281\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.930\nWhat does it mean to be\nan internal drive right?\n\n282\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.720\nIt's not in my body, what does that mean?\n\n283\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.480\nWell that means if I take and\nI put that case up here on\n\n284\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.680\nthe table that we were looking at\nwhen we were looking at the towers.\n\n285\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.460\nI have to open the case, open the tower,\n\n286\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.363\nif you will, get into the computer and\nunattach these.\n\n287\n00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:25.985\nOr detach these from the motherboard and\npull them out of the case,\n\n288\n00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:26.845\nthat's what it means.\n\n289\n00:15:26.845 --> 00:15:30.785\nIt's internal to the system unit,\nreally is what your point of reference\n\n290\n00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:35.255\nshould be there but that isn't the only\ntype of storage device we have.\n\n291\n00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:37.995\nWe also have external storage.\n\n292\n00:15:37.995 --> 00:15:40.215\nNow, what do I mean when\nI say external storage.\n\n293\n00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:43.045\nWell, again I want you to\nlook at it from the point and\n\n294\n00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:46.930\nthe perspective of the system case itself,\nright.\n\n295\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.090\nThe system unit, if it's internal drive,\n\n296\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.630\nmeans I have to open the case\nto get to the storage device.\n\n297\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.198\nAn external drive means I\ndon't have to open the case.\n\n298\n00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:59.937\nI can leave the case the way it is and\nthere should be some kind of port.\n\n299\n00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:02.662\nLittle hole if you will,\nan interface, a plug.\n\n300\n00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.913\nThat you can plug these devices into, and\n\n301\n00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:08.590\nthat's where some of these external\ndevices come into play for us.\n\n302\n00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:13.530\nI went ahead and just mentioned two\nof the most common types of external\n\n303\n00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.590\nstorage that are out there there's a third\none here, we'll see it in a second here.\n\n304\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.100\nAnd, this is what's known as\nan external USB drive, all right, and\n\n305\n00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.660\nyou also have the small\nlittle thumb drives.\n\n306\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.880\nWhat are the benefits of these?\n\n307\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.550\nWell, just like the internal drives,\n\n308\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.820\nI get the ability that if I need to create\na file and I need to drag and drop it,\n\n309\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.700\nI can put it on that thumb drive or I can\nput it on that USB external drive and\n\n310\n00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.830\nthen I can unplug it, cuz it's external,\nI don't have to open the case or anything.\n\n311\n00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.242\nI don't have to go through all that\ntrouble, I can unplug it from the machine\n\n312\n00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:46.780\nand then I can say, hey Ronnie, that\ndocument that you needed, here you go.\n\n313\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.150\nThe drivers that you needed weren't too\nbig, I put them on a thumb drive, Ronnie,\n\n314\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.800\nhere you go, or vice versa.\n\n315\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.900\nIf Ronnie says, hey Wes,\nI've got a task I need you to do,\n\n316\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.991\nI've got a mother board that needs\nits chip-set drivers, right.\n\n317\n00:16:55.991 --> 00:16:59.180\nWell I say, well Ronnie,\nI don't have anything,\n\n318\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.600\nyou want me to write them\ndown on a piece of paper?\n\n319\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.740\nRonnie says, no I got a thumb drive.\n\n320\n00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.780\nI need you to put them on there and\ngive them back to me by noon today.\n\n321\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.598\nI can do that, right.\n\n322\n00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:09.156\nThe external storage has the benefit\nof being plug and play and\n\n323\n00:17:09.156 --> 00:17:11.970\nI know I use that term,\nyou might hear that term.\n\n324\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.760\nRemember plug and\n\n325\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.990\nplay simply means when I plug the device\nin the computer should recognize it and\n\n326\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.690\nit should configure everything for me and\nI don't have to worry about going out and\n\n327\n00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.530\ninstalling drivers, and that's a good\nbenefit of these devices as well.\n\n328\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.360\nAll right,\nwhat else do we need to look at?\n\n329\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.820\nThe other common external storage\ndevice that I want you to be aware\n\n330\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.660\nof are different memory cards, and\nthere are a slew of them guys and\n\n331\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.070\nwe certainly don't wanna go\ninto all the different ones.\n\n332\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.550\nI did go ahead and take the time\nto talk about a common one here,\n\n333\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.880\nbut these just happen to be,\nyou can see on the left hand side,\n\n334\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.150\nthese are older ones,\nthese are MMC multimedia cards and\n\n335\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.700\nyou can see guys they come in all\ndifferent shapes and sizes and formats.\n\n336\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.110\nThere's other ones out there called\ncompact flash, CF cards as well.\n\n337\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.750\nAgain, they're pretty much the same,\n\n338\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.830\nthe one exception to the compact\nflash card is it's just a square box.\n\n339\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.240\nThat's really the only thing that differs,\nthe concept is identical.\n\n340\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.120\nI did go ahead and\ntake the time to mention these,\n\n341\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.230\nand I do wanna talk about this one\nbecause this is a common one that is not\n\n342\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.450\nonly used in your traditional desktop and\nlaptop systems,\n\n343\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.660\nit is also commonly used in IoT based\ndevices as well as your cell phones.\n\n344\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.630\nAnd since we have to know about all of\nthose, that's why I felt that this one was\n\n345\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.260\na good thing to just take a second here\nand talk about this external storage here.\n\n346\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.100\nAnd you can see, and I love this picture\ntoo because if we really look at it,\n\n347\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.130\nit tells you the different\nformats that they come in.\n\n348\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.080\nAll right, and as far as the communication\ntype goes, these are called secure digital\n\n349\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.020\ncards, they're SD cards, and you can see\nthe three different formats right there.\n\n350\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.969\nYou can see the bigger card\nis what's known as the mini,\n\n351\n00:18:49.969 --> 00:18:55.040\nthe mini SD card, you've got the micro SD\ncard which is a little bit smaller, and\n\n352\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.000\nthen, that's the little guy right here,\nthis one is the one that is\n\n353\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.410\nprobably the most common and\nwhere you find that one a lot.\n\n354\n00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.870\nIn fact, I can almost guarantee if we were\nto take the back of Ronnie's cellphone off\n\n355\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.200\nand my cellphone off we'd probably mind\none of these micro SD cards in there.\n\n356\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.670\nAgain, they are also common on things like\na Raspberry Pi, which is a very small IoT\n\n357\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:20.170\nbased type computer, I do wanna take\ntime so that you guys can see that.\n\n358\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.110\n>> All right, Wes, so\n\n359\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.680\ntalking about the different types of\nstorage that we have available here,\n\n360\n00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.500\nwhat makes this different from the hard\ndrives you were describing earlier?\n\n361\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.680\nThe idea of whether we're talking\nabout the USB flash drive or\n\n362\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.760\nwhether we're talking about\nthese types of cards here versus\n\n363\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.080\nthe hard drives you were showing us.\n\n364\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.483\n>> That is a great question.\n\n365\n00:19:37.483 --> 00:19:42.675\nThe first two that we talked about\nare mechanical drives, right and these,\n\n366\n00:19:42.675 --> 00:19:48.106\nin fact if we could go back to the SD card\nor just the memory cards in general here,\n\n367\n00:19:48.106 --> 00:19:52.100\nthese are a completely different\ntype of storage medium.\n\n368\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.497\nThese are what is known as\nelectrical storage, all right.\n\n369\n00:19:54.497 --> 00:19:59.033\nAnd electrical storage means exactly that,\nwe're not using magnets, if you will,\n\n370\n00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.550\nmagnetic storage, right.\n\n371\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.050\nWhat we're doing is sending electronical\nsignals into what are known as flash\n\n372\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.630\nmemory chips and these memory chips\nare much like the chips that you see on\n\n373\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.980\nthe RAM modules that we were showing you,\nthe system memory.\n\n374\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.520\nBut the difference is, they're non\nvolatile, which means, if you remember\n\n375\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.530\nback, if not, go check that video out,\nmeans when I shut the computer down,\n\n376\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.900\nany information that I put on these\ndevices should still be there, so\n\n377\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.760\nthat's one of the major things is\nthat they're an electrical storage.\n\n378\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.830\nThe other thing is that\nthey are non-mechanical.\n\n379\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.190\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n380\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.600\nWell remember how I told you things like\nyour parallel drives, the older parallel\n\n381\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.240\ndrives, I told you the serial ATA drives,\nif I drop them they aren't shock proof.\n\n382\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.350\nNow, understand if you drop these\nthings off a ten story building,\n\n383\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.130\nI can't tell you that\nthey're gonna survive.\n\n384\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.390\n[LAUGH] But these do a little bit better\nrattling around in your backpack if you're\n\n385\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.330\nat school, and you happen to have one of\nthese in your backpack and it's rattling\n\n386\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.570\naround, it's gonna do a lot better than\nif you have that mechanical drive,\n\n387\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.640\nlike that external USB drive in your\nbackpack and it's rattling around.\n\n388\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.982\nDon't ask me how I know that.\n\n389\n00:21:02.982 --> 00:21:05.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've actually got a USB drive that when\n\n390\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.870\nI plug it in it sounds like\na helicopter taking off,\n\n391\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.340\nit's probably about ready to die on me.\n\n392\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.630\nAnd that makes the point that these are\na better type of storage when it comes to\n\n393\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.530\nworrying about being shock proof or not.\n\n394\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.080\n>> When we start also\ntaking a look at this,\n\n395\n00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.050\nremember that the idea\nhere is fairly simple.\n\n396\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.590\nOne has moving parts, right?\n\n397\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.933\nThe mechanical drives,\nthere's moving parts, there's spinning,\n\n398\n00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:28.590\nI'm gonna say splinning.\n\n399\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.940\nSpinning platters in them, and\nthere's an actuator arm in there,\n\n400\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.660\nan armature, whatever we call it,\n\n401\n00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:41.050\nthat actually physically locates\ndata on those different platters.\n\n402\n00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.870\nIn these types of\nelectronic storage though,\n\n403\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.760\neverything is stored electronically\non those chips and so\n\n404\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.900\nthere is no need for actually moving\nthe internal parts to locate it.\n\n405\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.250\nIt can be electronically located by\nactually pointing the software to say\n\n406\n00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.880\nyou're retrieving it from here, and\nit pulls it up instantaneously.\n\n407\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.520\nA lot of times these types of devices and\nit depends on the interface on these\n\n408\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.420\ntypes of electronic storage here you'll\nprobably get faster performance,\n\n409\n00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.310\nespecially since the majorities,\nthe majority of these,\n\n410\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.510\nexcuse me,\nare going to be external types of devices.\n\n411\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.840\nThey do sell internal types of\nsolid state devices out there for\n\n412\n00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.750\nstorage but capacity is kind of\nthe key right now in the marketplace.\n\n413\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.778\nIn other words the more capacity that you\nwant,t he more cost it's gonna be and\n\n414\n00:22:30.778 --> 00:22:34.931\nthat's true a mechanical drives but the\ncost actually even goes a bit higher when\n\n415\n00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:38.229\nyou start talking about solid\nstate storage for performance and\n\n416\n00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:39.662\ncapacity at the same time.\n\n417\n00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:43.897\nAll right, Wes now that we have taken\na look at those things it seems like it's\n\n418\n00:22:43.897 --> 00:22:48.480\na no brainer, I need some type of storage,\nnow I'm ready to store data on it right?\n\n419\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.611\n>> Unfortunately no.\n\n420\n00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:54.014\nWe've got a little bit more leg\nwork to do, let's go ahead and\n\n421\n00:22:54.014 --> 00:22:55.720\ntake you down a scenario here.\n\n422\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.580\nYou're a technician or maybe you're\nhelping support somebody you've replaced\n\n423\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.040\na hard drive for him, right?\n\n424\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.270\nWe plugged our data cable into the\nappropriate location on the motherboard,\n\n425\n00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.910\nwe've plugged that data cable into\nthe appropriate location on the back of\n\n426\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.310\nthe hard drive, and likewise with\nthe power cable, the same thing goes.\n\n427\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.220\nWe've taken the power cable off\nthe back of the power supply, and\n\n428\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.410\nwe've plugged the appropriate\ncable into the back of the drive.\n\n429\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.510\nNow we put the case back on, and we power\nup the machine, and like Ronnie said,\n\n430\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.450\nwe're ready to store, right?\n\n431\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.800\nNo, that's half of the leg work, the other\nleg work is making the operating system\n\n432\n00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.570\naware of the drive, and\nnow to start to be able to work with it.\n\n433\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.310\nNow, we're gonna talk about the operating\nsystem in another episode, we really show\n\n434\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.120\nthe interface and if this is the first\ntime you've ever seen a computer or\n\n435\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.280\nused an interface, I would recommend\ngoing and jumping to that episode and\n\n436\n00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.160\nthen coming back here to look and see\nwhat we're doing but, let's go ahead and\n\n437\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.280\njust show you the basics on how you\nwould get one of this drives that you\n\n438\n00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.280\njust installed,\nready to go in online to store data.\n\n439\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.689\nI've got my Windows 7\nmachine pulled up here and\n\n440\n00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:58.640\nwe've just installed our hard drive.\n\n441\n00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.680\nThe next thing I have to do is I have\nto find a utility that allows me to\n\n442\n00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:09.712\narrange or to start to Design, if you\nwill, apply a structure to the platters,\n\n443\n00:24:09.712 --> 00:24:13.944\nthey physical platters if you will,\non the hard drive so\n\n444\n00:24:13.944 --> 00:24:18.110\nthat the operating systems\nsays I know that it is.\n\n445\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.580\nI can see it and I can use that hard\ndrive, so let's go and do that.\n\n446\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.890\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna drop down to our Start Menu.\n\n447\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:31.220\nAnd I'm gonna open up a common utility\nthat we use inside of Windows 7,\n\n448\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.690\nhere, when we need to\nwork with our hard drive.\n\n449\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.440\nSo that's gonna be a software\ncalled Disk Management.\n\n450\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.680\nAll right now, when this launches up\nnext thing that we're gonna do is we\n\n451\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.050\nhave to start applying a structure,\nlike I said, to the hard drive itself.\n\n452\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.480\nI want you to think of a hard drive\nas nothing more than a box, right?\n\n453\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.420\nBut we need to use it kind of\nlike a filing cabinet, right?\n\n454\n00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.040\nThat's very important for us if we're\ngoing to store something in it, right?\n\n455\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.700\nWe can't just, I guess you could, you\ncould take a box and just throw stuff in\n\n456\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:11.240\nit but we wanna make this look like a\nfiling cabinet more than just a metal tin.\n\n457\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.600\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n458\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.580\nWe're gonna first apply a structure\nto this that allow us like for\n\n459\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.150\ninstance like I said to start making\nthis filing cabinet, all right?\n\n460\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.720\nSo we're gonna check Disk Management,\nall right, and\n\n461\n00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.740\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna\ncontact that drive, right?\n\n462\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.510\nAnd so your data cables have to be there,\nyour power cables, for\n\n463\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.160\nit to understand that hey,\nthat disk is there.\n\n464\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.040\nThen the first thing it says is hey,\nwe gotta bring this disk online, right?\n\n465\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.240\nSo that's what we're gonna do, all right?\n\n466\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.700\nAnd now the operating system says\nokay I understand the starting point.\n\n467\n00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.570\nAll right, I understand that\nyou wanna create, essentially,\n\n468\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.070\nthis metal filing cabinet, but\nall it is, is really just the shell.\n\n469\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.290\nAll right, now what we have to do is,\nwe have to put some shelves.\n\n470\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.870\nWe have to divide it up the way we want,\nright?\n\n471\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.490\nSo, what we're gonna do is, we're\ngonna take, and we're gonna make this,\n\n472\n00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:05.050\nlet's say, a four shelf filing cabinets.\n\n473\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.500\nAll right, our hard drive if you will.\n\n474\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.750\nSo if you'll notice,\nI've got my disk down here.\n\n475\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.890\nAll right, and unallocated just\nmeans we can't use it, right?\n\n476\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.430\nLet's take the jargon out of that one.\n\n477\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.120\nIt says unallocated,\nwe can't really do anything with it.\n\n478\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.100\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n479\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.030\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna start\nto divide that filing cabinet up, right?\n\n480\n00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.160\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nright-click here and\n\n481\n00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.700\nwhat I'm doing here is something\nknown as partitioning, all right?\n\n482\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.100\nWhat it's gonna do is, I want you to\nthink of a partition as a way to apply,\n\n483\n00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.660\nlet's say,\nmultiple rooms in a single house.\n\n484\n00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.340\nIf I'm looking at\nthe house from the outside,\n\n485\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.400\nit just looks like one house, right?\n\n486\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.030\nI'm looking at the drive from an outside,\nit just looks like a single drive right.\n\n487\n00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.970\nI want you to think of this as a way\nthat I'm gonna put like in a house.\n\n488\n00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.100\nAs a designer, I'm gonna say,\n\n489\n00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.660\nyou know what I'm gonna have four\nrooms in this house, all right.\n\n490\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.960\nSo let's go ahead and do that, all right.\n\n491\n00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:04.000\nWe're gonna start with one room first, all\nright, and I'll just reduce the size here.\n\n492\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.600\nBasically we're telling\nthe operating system,\n\n493\n00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.240\nthis is the size of the room we want.\n\n494\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.560\nAnd we'll just walk through this and\nI'll call this Room1, all right.\n\n495\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.320\nAgain, keep in mind this is a partition.\n\n496\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.970\nAnd then,\nthe next thing that we have to do is,\n\n497\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.830\nwe have to apply something known\nas a filing system, all right?\n\n498\n00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:28.290\nI want you to think about it,\nif I was to take and put that drawer,\n\n499\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.160\nin that filing cabinet, right?\n\n500\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.450\nBut, it was just a single drawer,\nthat's all.\n\n501\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.860\nWell, could you put files and\nfolders in there?\n\n502\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.270\nI mean, I guess you could.\n\n503\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.540\nBut wouldn't it be nice to\nhave rails to put folders, and\n\n504\n00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.110\nthen put these files in folders,\nso that when you open it up,\n\n505\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.750\nyou've got a logical structure to it,\nand it makes sense?\n\n506\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.800\nYour operating system needs\nto work that way too.\n\n507\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.420\nIt says, okay, now I've got this container\nbut I can't do anything with a container.\n\n508\n00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.030\nI need to apply something that\nI understand to allow me to\n\n509\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.340\nuse that container and that's what\nthe file system is doing here too.\n\n510\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.740\nWe'll talk more about file\nsystems in another episode and\n\n511\n00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.490\nthen we'll choose Finish, all right.\n\n512\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.920\nAnd it'll take a second here and\nwhat it's doing is it's saying, okay.\n\n513\n00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.590\nLet me go ahead and I'll put\nthe rails in that cabinet for you.\n\n514\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.500\nAnd now you're able to start to use and\nput files and folders in there.\n\n515\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.700\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n516\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.990\nNow that we've got that,\nnotice I kind of just named it Room1.\n\n517\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.480\nKeep with the analogy of the house, right?\n\n518\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.450\nWell, if I go down here,\n\n519\n00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.480\nyou can see that all the sudden I've\ngot this folder is blinking, right?\n\n520\n00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.720\nAnd say, hey, pay attention to me,\npay attention to me.\n\n521\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.538\nWell let's see what it's\ntelling me to pay attention to.\n\n522\n00:28:33.538 --> 00:28:36.820\nWell, there's Room1,\nwell what does that mean?\n\n523\n00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:42.010\nWell, that means, this partition, this\ndraw, this room is now open for business.\n\n524\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.510\nAnd it's up to me if I want to,\nI could start to use it,\n\n525\n00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.780\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n526\n00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.568\nBasically in here, I could say,\nyou know what, I wanna create a folder.\n\n527\n00:28:56.435 --> 00:29:00.806\nMaybe Zoom out there a little bit,\n\n528\n00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:06.110\nthere we go and I'll call this my folder.\n\n529\n00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.270\nNotice that I can start to use this,\nall right?\n\n530\n00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.630\nI cannot use this information,\nany of this space over here, right.\n\n531\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.430\nI haven't made a room out of it yet,\nright.\n\n532\n00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.580\nI haven't divided it up,\n\n533\n00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.250\nI haven't said that at this point I've\ngot a house with one room, right?\n\n534\n00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.060\nBut now I've said okay,\nthis is a living room.\n\n535\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.500\nI've applied a structure to it,\nnow I know what it is and in this case for\n\n536\n00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.950\nthe operating system's sake\nwe can now start to use it.\n\n537\n00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.930\nThat shows you how to get this\nstorage device, as they call it,\n\n538\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.890\npartitioned, formatted and now it's\nactually a storage device that we can use.\n\n539\n00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.030\nBeforehand it's just a physical device,\nthat's like Ronnie's made mention in other\n\n540\n00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.440\nepisodes, it's an expensive paperweight,\nreally doesn't do anything.\n\n541\n00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.810\nWe've applied that structure to it,\n\n542\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.880\nwe told the operating system this\nis what we're gonna do with it.\n\n543\n00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.480\nSo we've formatted it and\nnow we can use it as a storage device.\n\n544\n00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.670\n>> This is, no doubt, the understanding\nthat data cannot go on a drive,\n\n545\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.590\nregardless of whether its a solid\nstate drive or flash drive.\n\n546\n00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.410\nOr mechanical drives without\neither the partitioning or\n\n547\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.990\nthe actual formatting on there.\n\n548\n00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:10.120\nBecause if we do try to put data on to\na drive like that, there's no way for\n\n549\n00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.170\nthat system to be able to locate\ndata on that drive as well So\n\n550\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.630\nwe do need that understanding.\n\n551\n00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.710\nNow, Wes we already talked\nabout hard drives and\n\n552\n00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.990\nthe core to formatting fairly well.\n\n553\n00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.100\nWhat other types of drives do we need\nto think about in terms of storage?\n\n554\n00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.260\n>> One of the last things that I'd like to\ntackle in this episode is optical drives.\n\n555\n00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.470\nIt's one of the things that we need to\nknow, it's another storage device that is\n\n556\n00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.960\nout there and I know that we might\nsee it disappear eventually.\n\n557\n00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.440\nBut it's still very prevalent and\n\n558\n00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.210\nit's gonna be something that\nyou're gonna encounter.\n\n559\n00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.660\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n560\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.160\nOptical drive,\nwe've got one here that you can see.\n\n561\n00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.630\nNotice that we've got another mechanical,\nmagnetic based media unlike the one that\n\n562\n00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.390\nRonnie and I were talking about earlier,\nlike solid state's electrical, right?\n\n563\n00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.400\nYour memory cards,\nthis is a mechanical drive.\n\n564\n00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.740\nAnd we put these optical disks\ninside the tray, we push our button,\n\n565\n00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.370\nhopefully we push the button and it\ninserts that disk into the optical drive.\n\n566\n00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:12.050\nAnd it uses a laser in order to read and\nwrite information on that disk.\n\n567\n00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.860\nAnd essentially what it's doing\nis it's burning the disk, really.\n\n568\n00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.000\nIt's either reading from it, right,\nwhich isn't doing anything to the disk,\n\n569\n00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.160\nother than the laser is interpreting\nlittle raised areas and\n\n570\n00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.750\nlowered areas on the disk surface.\n\n571\n00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.440\nOr the laser is actually burning and\nmelting the plastic in the disk.\n\n572\n00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.000\nAnd what that does is, that's essentially\nwriting the data to the disk.\n\n573\n00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.460\nNow that being said, there are different\nformats over the years and\n\n574\n00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.770\nI kinda wanna just look at these.\n\n575\n00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.400\nAnd you really can make these fairly easy.\n\n576\n00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.940\nI know it looks like a slew\nof letters up here, guys,\n\n577\n00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.530\nwe'll see if we can break it down,\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n578\n00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.388\nThree of the ones that we\nreally need to look at,\n\n579\n00:31:48.388 --> 00:31:49.897\nthat have become the industry standard.\n\n580\n00:31:49.897 --> 00:31:54.668\nThere's an older one, CDs,\nDVDs and blue ray disk and\n\n581\n00:31:54.668 --> 00:31:57.800\nlook at the different variations.\n\n582\n00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.132\nAnd man, like I said, this looks\nlike it could be very confusing.\n\n583\n00:32:01.132 --> 00:32:02.546\nWe got ROM, we got.\n\n584\n00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:06.282\nR, we've got RW,\nwell what does that mean for us?\n\n585\n00:32:06.282 --> 00:32:10.159\nWell let's take a look at what\nthat means for us, all right?\n\n586\n00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:14.901\nWhen we look at ROM, all right,\nI want you to notice something about ROM.\n\n587\n00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:18.501\nROM, and apparently I've got\na random text box there.\n\n588\n00:32:18.501 --> 00:32:25.590\n[LAUGH] ROM is one in which you\ncan only read, you cannot write.\n\n589\n00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.430\nAll right, and\nthat is important to understand.\n\n590\n00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.250\nSo notice that I don't have\nthe ability to write to it.\n\n591\n00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.296\nThat means the manufacturer, whoever made\nthat disk, they put the data on it and\n\n592\n00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:40.643\nthey sealed it in a way that you\ncan't do anything else to the disk.\n\n593\n00:32:40.643 --> 00:32:45.448\nYour, video games are like this,\nyour audio CDs are like this.\n\n594\n00:32:45.448 --> 00:32:49.280\nI can't put additional\ninformation onto there.\n\n595\n00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.820\nThe R is what's known as writable.\n\n596\n00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.440\nNow, if we look at this one, R writable\nmeans I can write to the disk one time,\n\n597\n00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.330\nbut then after that,\nI don't have the ability to write again.\n\n598\n00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.380\nNow, from them on out, it's read only.\n\n599\n00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.590\nSo write once, read multiple times.\n\n600\n00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.970\nNow, the other ones here are,\nthey're unique in a way.\n\n601\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.050\nWell, not this one, but\nthe RE definitely is.\n\n602\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:20.390\nThe reason I have them together is because\nessentially even though the letters\n\n603\n00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.950\ndiffer, and the format differs,\nthey're doing the same thing.\n\n604\n00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.540\nRW, and\nI don't care if these are CDs or DVDs.\n\n605\n00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.490\nR, ROM, R, and RW mean the same thing.\n\n606\n00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.760\nSo RW basically means rewritable.\n\n607\n00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.290\nNotice that I have multiple writes.\n\n608\n00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.340\nWrite many times, read as much as\nyou want, but write many times.\n\n609\n00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.550\nRE is what they call in Blu-ray\nessentially a writable disk,\n\n610\n00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:49.293\nrewritable disk, it's called recordable or\nerasable, that's specific to Blue-ray.\n\n611\n00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:54.510\nFinally, lets, I put the carriage\nright in front of the horse there,\n\n612\n00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.805\nso we could take away all\nof those crazy letterings.\n\n613\n00:33:57.805 --> 00:34:02.657\nCuz now we only have three different sets\nof letters to worry about CD, DVD and\n\n614\n00:34:02.657 --> 00:34:03.420\nBlu-ray.\n\n615\n00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.970\nWell what does that mean for us?\n\n616\n00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.882\nWell, lets take a look at that.\n\n617\n00:34:06.882 --> 00:34:13.766\nWhen it comes to CDs and DVDs and Blu-ray.\n\n618\n00:34:13.766 --> 00:34:18.250\nI really want you to think about\nthe capacity of information that can be\n\n619\n00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.165\nstored on it.\n\n620\n00:34:19.165 --> 00:34:21.236\nAnd also want you to\nthink about the speed.\n\n621\n00:34:21.236 --> 00:34:24.893\nCDs around 700 megs, I know they vary,\nI know there's variations on it,\n\n622\n00:34:24.893 --> 00:34:26.600\nthe most common one is 700 megs.\n\n623\n00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.520\nSo what is it good for?\n\n624\n00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.030\nWell, what I didn't put up here is data,\nit's good for data as well.\n\n625\n00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.930\nBut it's also common in things for\naudio files, it's,\n\n626\n00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:39.120\nI think about 80 minutes of audio\nfiles that can be put in to it.\n\n627\n00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.700\nIt's not really too good for video.\n\n628\n00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.890\nAlthough you will see older disk out there\nthat might still have some video want it.\n\n629\n00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:50.190\nThe common one that used video is DVD.\n\n630\n00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.720\nNotice the difference here\nbetween the CD and the DVD.\n\n631\n00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.120\nThe DVD gives me up to around 17 gigs,\n\n632\n00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.110\nI'll tell you most commonly is\ngonna be either 4.7 or 9.4 gigs.\n\n633\n00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:04.200\nBut, again it's about the compacity also\nthe quality of the playback if you will.\n\n634\n00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.738\nSo, it's very good for movies this is why\nDVD was so common to find movies on it.\n\n635\n00:35:10.738 --> 00:35:14.353\nBlu-ray on the other hand,\nit's still movies and keep in mind,\n\n636\n00:35:14.353 --> 00:35:16.400\nyou could use these for data as well.\n\n637\n00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.090\nIt's still movies but\nnow it's the quality of that movie.\n\n638\n00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.630\nHigh definition, remember we told you\nthat's a big watermelon of basket.\n\n639\n00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.375\nThat's a lot of capacity on that drive\nwell Blu-ray could scale up to about a 128\n\n640\n00:35:28.375 --> 00:35:31.010\ngigs depending on what\nkind of disc you have.\n\n641\n00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.530\nWhich makes them ideal for high definition\nvideo and high definition playback.\n\n642\n00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.170\nSo you also see those commonly.\n\n643\n00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.540\nSo those are the three.\n\n644\n00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.310\nAnd like I said, don't make all of those\njumbling of letters confuse you there.\n\n645\n00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.708\nIt doesn't have to be confusing.\n\n646\n00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:47.560\nR, RW, and RE in this case.\n\n647\n00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.690\nIt depends on, do you want to write to it\nand do you want to write multiple times?\n\n648\n00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.650\nWhen it comes to CD, DVD and\nBlu-ray it's about the capacity.\n\n649\n00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.420\nQuality and the speed of the output.\n\n650\n00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.370\nSo, that is the other storage media\nthat we want you to take a look at.\n\n651\n00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.920\nWe definitely want you to know because\nit is one that you're gonna come across\n\n652\n00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.440\nwhen you decide that you're\ngonna support computing.\n\n653\n00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.170\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n654\n00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.120\nWell, thank you for introducing us to\nsome of those different storage devices\n\n655\n00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.900\nthat we are gonna encounter\nas users out there.\n\n656\n00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.400\nRemember that a lot of these, of course,\n\n657\n00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.720\nare based around that\nidea of capacity as well.\n\n658\n00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.580\nAnd you need to get the type of storage\nfor your computer that's gonna actually\n\n659\n00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.830\nsupport how much stuff that you would need\nto store on those types of drives as well.\n\n660\n00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.870\nAnd then, from that point,\nyou just select the right type of media.\n\n661\n00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.480\nWhether you're going for a solid state or\nsome type of flash drive or\n\n662\n00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.130\nwhether you're going for\nmechanical or even optical.\n\n663\n00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.830\nThose are some of the different\nselections that you have ahead of you.\n\n664\n00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.780\n>> Well, and that's a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n665\n00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.960\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n666\n00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.980\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n667\n00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.125\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n668\n00:36:52.125 --> 00:37:01.920\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.700\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n4\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.920\nWe are about to actually take a look into,\n\n5\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.360\nwell, the operating system side of\nthings and software side of things.\n\n6\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.950\nAnd here to help us out to understand this\nintegration of ideas is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.160\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n8\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.048\n>> Thanks for having me here.\n\n9\n00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:35.607\nThat's right,\nit's great to be here with ITProTV crew.\n\n10\n00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:39.193\nThat's right, we're gonna be diving\ninto the operating system now and\n\n11\n00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:42.013\nwe've been talking so\nfar about a lot of hardware here but\n\n12\n00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:45.267\nwe haven't really touched base\non is what drives that hardware.\n\n13\n00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:49.426\nAnd what is the basic interface\ninto the computing environment,\n\n14\n00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:51.850\ninto the computing system as a whole.\n\n15\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.830\nSo we definitely wanna start looking\nat the operating system architecture.\n\n16\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.780\nSo what is an operating system and\nwhy do we even need one?\n\n17\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.990\nWell an operating system\nessentially allows us to work\n\n18\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.650\nwith an information system.\n\n19\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.610\nWithout it, we wouldn't be able to\nwork with information systems at all.\n\n20\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.060\nAnd even more basically than that,\n\n21\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.030\nan operating system allows\nus to control our hardware.\n\n22\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.050\nSo it is important, very important,\n\n23\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.630\nthat we have an operating system on our\nmachines so that we can use these systems.\n\n24\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.725\nBecause keep in mind, it's the hardware\nthat needs to run, and it's the operating\n\n25\n00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:27.415\nsystem that communicates to\nthat hardware to make it run.\n\n26\n00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:32.015\nI've actually got a little diagram\nhere that just to bring up abstractly\n\n27\n00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:36.452\nthe different layers here that we have,\nso if we could pull up the computer here.\n\n28\n00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:40.082\nWhen we look at it, there's a few\ndifferent layers that we have, right.\n\n29\n00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:43.232\nThe user,\nwhat does the user interact with?\n\n30\n00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:44.862\nRemember, it all boils\ndown to the hardware and\n\n31\n00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:47.182\nwe're trying to get that\nhardware to do what we want so\n\n32\n00:01:47.182 --> 00:01:49.222\nthat we can work with\nan information system.\n\n33\n00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:51.832\nWell, the primary interface\n\n34\n00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.762\ninto the machine is gonna\nbe a couple different ways.\n\n35\n00:01:54.762 --> 00:01:59.150\nWe have this term of what's known as\na GUI, that's a Graphical User Interface.\n\n36\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.900\nAnd the graphical user interface is where\nwe can use like our mouse if you will.\n\n37\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.650\nAnd we've got a cursor an arrow on\n\n38\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.400\nthe screen typically where we can do\nsomething known as point and click.\n\n39\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.500\nAnd it makes it fairly easy to work\nwith your operating system once you\n\n40\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.720\nknow some of the basics in\nhow to navigate through\n\n41\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.430\nthe different locations inside\nof the operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.310\nThe other thing that we have is\nwhat's known as a command line\n\n43\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.260\ninterpreter, right?\n\n44\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.510\nAnd a command line interpreter is where\nwe can essentially take the mouse and\n\n45\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.230\nthrow it away.\n\n46\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.820\nNo, don't do that, don't throw\nyour mouse away, I was kidding.\n\n47\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.860\nAnd we basically are going to type text\nbased information into a dialogue box and\n\n48\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.020\nthat is how we are going to interact\ninside of the operating system.\n\n49\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.500\nNow, the next thing that we have, the next\nlayer below that are the applications that\n\n50\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.130\nwe use to get the output that we want,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.320\nWe have all different types of\napplications and software out there.\n\n52\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.110\nAnd these actually run on top of\nthe operating system if you will.\n\n53\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.690\nAnd we have things like our productivity\napps, we have utilities and\n\n54\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.360\ndifferent multi media applications where\nwe can do things like watching video.\n\n55\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.030\nSo what is the layer below that?\n\n56\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.630\nWell here is where we start to get to\nthe actual operating system and the core\n\n57\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.680\nfunctionality that's really helping us\ncommunicate with our hardware, right?\n\n58\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.160\nAnd there's all different\ntypes that we have out there.\n\n59\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.910\nAnd these are by far definitely\nthe most popular that we have in there.\n\n60\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140\nAnd we've got Windows and we'll talk a\nlittle more about these operating systems.\n\n61\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.690\nWe have Unix that's been around for\na long time.\n\n62\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.870\nSome of you might be familiar with Mac,\nthe OS X operating system is out there and\n\n63\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.880\nthen we have Linux.\n\n64\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.110\nAnd inside of that operating\nsystem we have different\n\n65\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.830\ncomponents that help us to\ninteract with the hardware.\n\n66\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.540\nWe have things like background\nprocesses that go on.\n\n67\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.170\nNow, what is a background process?\n\n68\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.275\nNotice that it's not in\nthe application section.\n\n69\n00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:50.805\nBecause a background process,\n\n70\n00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:54.815\nunlike an application usually\nisn't triggered by an end user.\n\n71\n00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:57.825\nMeaning, quite literally, looking at\nan icon and double clicking it and\n\n72\n00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:00.792\nmaybe a dialogue box comes up or\na notepad comes up.\n\n73\n00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.382\nSo your operating system\nhave these services and\n\n74\n00:04:03.382 --> 00:04:07.972\nprocesses in the background that are\nconstantly running, that we probably, for\n\n75\n00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:09.982\nthe most part, don't even see.\n\n76\n00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:15.432\nAnd you can probably put somewhere down\nhere a layer in between if you will.\n\n77\n00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:19.820\nThat's our drivers and that allows\nus to interact with the hardware.\n\n78\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.150\nSo when we, and then finally at the bottom\nwe have the hardware as well too.\n\n79\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.910\nWe zoom back out here, I want you to\nthink of the user being at the top.\n\n80\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.560\nThe user is going to interact basically\nwith one of these two interfaces.\n\n81\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.380\nAnd then what happens is the commands that\nthey send are based on the applications.\n\n82\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.350\nThe application talks to\nthe operating system and\n\n83\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.920\nI know we can't see\nthat arrow right there.\n\n84\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.390\nAnd then finally through the driver's and\nthe services that we have going on in\n\n85\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.400\nthe background, at the operating\nsystem talks to the hardware.\n\n86\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.209\nAnd then finally back through all\nof that stack we get our output\n\n87\n00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.329\ndisplayed on the monitor\nwhatever it might be.\n\n88\n00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.869\nIt might not be the fact that\nyou're trying to display anything,\n\n89\n00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.143\nit could be the fact that you're\njust trying to save data.\n\n90\n00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:09.730\nSo basically,\nthe interaction kind of works that way.\n\n91\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.340\nAll right, so an operating system in its\n\n92\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.530\nvery basic functionality allows\nus to control the hardware.\n\n93\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.300\nWithout an operating system,\n\n94\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.560\nunfortunately our hardware is just gonna\nbe sitting there doing absolutely nothing.\n\n95\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.450\nWe're not gonna have an information system\nand we're not gonna be able to use it.\n\n96\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.410\nSo the operating system is a very,\n\n97\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.830\nvery key point to the entire\ncomputing environment.\n\n98\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.610\n>> A lot of times, when you are actually\nworking inside of a business office,\n\n99\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.760\nsomewhere, more than likely, the operating\nsystem you're gonna encounter is, really,\n\n100\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.900\ngoing to be one operating system.\n\n101\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.080\nWhich is, probably, gonna be some\noperating system that's known as\n\n102\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.240\na Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\n103\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.645\nSo, you might see Windows 7, you might see\nWindows 8.1, you might even see Windows\n\n104\n00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:56.290\n10 but that's the most prolific\noperating system in existence out there,\n\n105\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.170\nespecially in the business world.\n\n106\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.910\nThe reason why is that there's so many\ndifferent controls that a company can put\n\n107\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.490\non to it, but that's not the only\noperating system that's out there.\n\n108\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.550\nAnd Wes is gonna help us to understand\nsome of the different types of operating\n\n109\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.510\nsystems that you may also encounter\nout there besides Windows as well.\n\n110\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.380\n>> That's right, wow we are gonna talk\nabout a few other operating systems, but\n\n111\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.210\nI have to agree with Ronnie, the one that\nyou're gonna see most common out of all of\n\n112\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.950\nthese operating systems are Windows.\n\n113\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.470\nAnd we put them in here just for the sake\nof completion, so that you know if you\n\n114\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.901\nare using Windows you don't randomly\none day hear of something else and\n\n115\n00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:32.420\nsay wait a second, there's another\noperating system other than Windows?\n\n116\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.550\nSo that's why we mention them here.\n\n117\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.220\nI've got a little diagram\ndrawn up here and\n\n118\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.180\nyou can see the common operating systems.\n\n119\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.790\nWe have Unix, Linux, OS X,\nand then Windows and\n\n120\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.510\nlets just kinda talk about each one\nthese just briefly, each one here.\n\n121\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.320\nNow Unix was one of the very first\noperating systems invented if you will.\n\n122\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.630\nLike I said there's other variations,\nthere's all different types of operating\n\n123\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.800\nsystems that came along in the early days\nbut this is one that became popular.\n\n124\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.400\nIt started out back in the late 60s,\n\n125\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.630\nearly 70s and it was a very machine\ndependent operating system.\n\n126\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.280\nWhen it was first written it mean it\ncould only run on one type of machine,\n\n127\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.580\nso unfortunately you were stuck.\n\n128\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.280\nI believe the old system was one of the,\nthey were called PP7's,\n\n129\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.880\nout there at\nDeck Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\n130\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.520\nAnd it operates on that kernel shell\narchitecture that we talked about\n\n131\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.110\nwhere the shell, if you will,\n\n132\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.470\nis an environment that allows the user\nto interface with the operating system.\n\n133\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.220\nIt is largely command driven,\nthis is not an easy operating\n\n134\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.050\nsystem if you're a beginner, like I said,\nwe mention it here so you're aware of it.\n\n135\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.180\nCertainly it takes a lot of work,\na lot of research, and\n\n136\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.280\nit could be a little bit of\na learning curve for some people.\n\n137\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.862\nBut we do mention it out there.\n\n138\n00:07:51.862 --> 00:07:54.911\nI do wanna mention the term,\nwhen we talk about operating system,\n\n139\n00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:58.558\nwe have to think about license, and\nhow license work, and there's two types of\n\n140\n00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:02.263\nlicense, proprietary and there's what's\nknown as open source proprietary,\n\n141\n00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:05.480\nmeans you control the code,\nyour company makes the money off of it.\n\n142\n00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.580\nAnd let's say if it's my company and\nRonnie decides well that's great code,\n\n143\n00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.300\nI wanna copy it and I wanna distribute it\nmyself, well I could, if I wanted to in\n\n144\n00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.150\nthis case, bring some kind of legality,\nbecause again, I own the software.\n\n145\n00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.890\nOpen source, on the other hand, that's\ngonna be something that's gonna be free.\n\n146\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.500\nIt's freely distributable.\n\n147\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.530\nYour code is out there.\n\n148\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.030\nPeople can modify it and\nthey can redistribute it.\n\n149\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.930\nUnix is one that, for the most part,\nis a closed source operating system.\n\n150\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.645\nHowever there are some open source\nalternatives like for instance FreeBSD.\n\n151\n00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:40.345\nThis is a multi user operating system.\n\n152\n00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:44.712\nAnd what that means is Ronnie and I could\nboth at the same be connected to a single\n\n153\n00:08:44.712 --> 00:08:48.022\nsystem unit, a physical device\nthat we're talking about.\n\n154\n00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:52.352\nBoth him and I could be operating it\non that same machine at one time and\n\n155\n00:08:52.352 --> 00:08:55.032\nwe wouldn't be interfering\nwith each other's environment.\n\n156\n00:08:55.032 --> 00:08:58.315\nSo it's kind of interesting, a little bit\ndifferent than maybe what you're used to.\n\n157\n00:08:58.315 --> 00:09:00.830\nBut if you haven't been familiar with\n\n158\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.950\ncomputers maybe it's\nnew to you all around.\n\n159\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.170\nNow a variation.\n\n160\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.170\nI say a variation of Unix.\n\n161\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.810\nYou gotta be careful with this\none because this is Linux.\n\n162\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.340\nAnd Linux is not Unix.\n\n163\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:18.630\nThis was one that came out In the early\n90s and it is an open source code.\n\n164\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.020\nIt's another operating system.\n\n165\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.300\nI want you to understand the layered\nabstract layers are gonna be the same.\n\n166\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.620\nIt's open source code which means\nthat you can download the code,\n\n167\n00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.700\nyou can download that\ninformation if you want.\n\n168\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.560\nYou can see it,\nyou can make modifications to it.\n\n169\n00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.360\nAnd then you can redistribute\nit to others, so\n\n170\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.340\nit is a free operating\nsystem that is out there.\n\n171\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.960\nAnd there are many different kinds,\nmany different flavors.\n\n172\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.430\nOne of the most common ones that I\njust might mention here is Ubuntu.\n\n173\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.665\nIt's one that maybe\nyou've heard of before.\n\n174\n00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:49.115\nFor the most part in the earlier days,\n\n175\n00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:51.965\nthis is another one that was\na learning curve for a lot of people.\n\n176\n00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:54.815\nYou would see people that were very,\nvery intelligent in the computers\n\n177\n00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:57.805\nusing it cuz it was largely command\ndriven, text based commands.\n\n178\n00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.735\nHowever, today they've changed that,\nthere's all different types of\n\n179\n00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:06.455\nwhat we said the graphical user interface,\nthe point and click technology.\n\n180\n00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:10.350\nSo even somebody like Wes can get in\nthere, who maybe is more Windows centric\n\n181\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.350\nI can work around in a familiar point and\nclick type of environment.\n\n182\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.300\nThis is also a multi-user operating system\nin the fact that two or three multiple\n\n183\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.030\npeople can be connected to a single\nmachine and using it simultaneously\n\n184\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.720\nwithout interfering with the other\nperson's work or what they're doing, or\n\n185\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.810\neven knowing really that they're,\nthat they are using machine currently.\n\n186\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:39.670\nWhich brings us to also to Mac, all right,\nand when we say that Macintosh,\n\n187\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.590\nwe're talking about current operating\nsystem and its derivatives.\n\n188\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:48.350\nIts got many different versions here and\nthat's OS X this is the Apple-based\n\n189\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.860\noperating system for Macintosh today,\nit was released in the early 2000s, 2001.\n\n190\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.760\nIt is a closed source and\nit's proprietary right?\n\n191\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.060\nJust like we were talking about with Unix.\n\n192\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.960\nThis is one where you're not\nallowed to see the code.\n\n193\n00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.510\nApple keeps the code wrapped up.\n\n194\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.060\nIt's not something that you can copy.\n\n195\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.870\nYou certainly can't redistribute it or\n\n196\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.000\nyou're going to have\na legality charge to you.\n\n197\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.380\nIt is a Unix derivative which\nis kind of interesting.\n\n198\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.430\nIt's started all the way back in the days\nwhen they were using code that was\n\n199\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.300\nfamiliar, that was a kin to Linux.\n\n200\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.430\nIt does have a limited amount of hardware.\n\n201\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.190\nHere's one thing that I didn't mention.\n\n202\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.210\nLinux is very portable to\ndifferent PC environments.\n\n203\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.730\nUp until recently,\nIit is very limited hardware,\n\n204\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.830\nApple controls the hardware, you can't\njust put this on any PC based machine.\n\n205\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.860\nAnd again, so they control even\nthe hardware aspect of this, so\n\n206\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.190\nvery closed source and very proprietary,\na good operating system as well.\n\n207\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.200\nAnd that brings us to the one that we're\ngoing to spend the most time in because\n\n208\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.950\nlike you've already heard Ronnie say, it\nis the one that is most common out there.\n\n209\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.270\nAnd it is the one not only in the home\nenvironment in the enterprise environment,\n\n210\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.940\nyou're probably going\nto see the majority of.\n\n211\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.480\nSo, Windows, what we got about Windows?\n\n212\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.010\nWell, Windows started out,\nbelieve it or not, released in 1985.\n\n213\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.250\nIt is closed source and\nproprietary as well,\n\n214\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.810\nwhich means you're not gonna be copying\nthe code there again because you could be\n\n215\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.740\ncharged with copyright violations.\n\n216\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.210\nSo what is it that made Windows so\npopular?\n\n217\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.310\nWhy is it today that there are so\nmany Windows devices out there?\n\n218\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.070\nWell remember I was telling you some\nof these earlier operating systems,\n\n219\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.630\nmaybe Mac not being one of them OS X but\nthese earlier operating systems were\n\n220\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.810\nlargely command line driven and they\nwere really based around the program or\n\n221\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.340\nthe person that really knew the code and\nstuff.\n\n222\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.460\nAnd they had to enter\nall text based commands.\n\n223\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:42.550\nWell what Windows did and Microsoft if\nyou will is the creator of Windows.\n\n224\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:48.290\nWhat they did is they found a way\nto take that text based Interface.\n\n225\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:53.030\nAnd wrap a graphical user interface\naround it so that you didn't\n\n226\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.245\nneed to know all of these text based\ncommands in order to work with a computer.\n\n227\n00:12:58.245 --> 00:12:59.110\nCuz in those days,\n\n228\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.150\nwhat would be very, very frustrating is\nthat you spent $1,000 on your computer,\n\n229\n00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.380\nyou'd spend another $300 on your operating\nsystem, and you'd have a book about\n\n230\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.760\nthis big that would teach you how to\neven work with the operating system.\n\n231\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.940\nSo what they said is like, hey,\nlet's throw that book out and\n\n232\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.360\nlet's take something that makes it easier.\n\n233\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.200\nWe'll put that graphical point and click\ninterface over this text based interface,\n\n234\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.325\nand then you don't even have\nto work with it that way.\n\n235\n00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:28.325\nSo as graphical user interfaces\nbecame more of the norm, more of\n\n236\n00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:33.365\nthe popular interface type, made it easier\nfor people to interact with computers.\n\n237\n00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:36.345\nYou didn't have to have\na degree at Berkley in order to\n\n238\n00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:38.125\nbe able use your computer.\n\n239\n00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:41.135\nThat's one of the reasons that\nmade Windows pretty much take off,\n\n240\n00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:44.315\nthey kind of revolutionized the point and\nclick technology.\n\n241\n00:13:44.315 --> 00:13:49.480\nNow unlike some of the other operating\nsystems, and specifically OS X,\n\n242\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.800\nthis has a wide variety of device support.\n\n243\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.090\nSo, a lot of device support.\n\n244\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.260\nA lot of manufactures support Windows,\nso you do have that as well.\n\n245\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.200\n>> RIght, Wes, what you just\nsubscribed as primate remote users\n\n246\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.920\nare going to encounter\nonto their desktop PCs.\n\n247\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.810\nOr something very similar on a laptop,\nwhether its Mac OS X or\n\n248\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.820\nwhether we're talking about some\nversion of Windows or Linux, or\n\n249\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.270\neven Unix, that's what we are normally\ngoing to encounter when we start\n\n250\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.600\nto deal with computers on a daily basis.\n\n251\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.800\nBut, there are other operating systems\nthat are out there, that allow us to,\n\n252\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.290\nactually, have more productivity,\nthat don't really, necessarily,\n\n253\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.760\nneed a user sitting at it every day,\nright?\n\n254\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.550\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, we do.\n\n255\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.660\nWe have other types of operating\nsystems that are, pretty,\n\n256\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.360\nmuch, the same manufacturer,\nif you will, but\n\n257\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.830\nthey're gonna be something that you're\ngonna see in a corporate environment\n\n258\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.250\nWe don't expect you at a fundamental level\nto really be working with these, but\n\n259\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.280\nit is good to at least have some\nkind of knowledge that they exist.\n\n260\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.310\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here,\nkinda show you about those.\n\n261\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.030\nAnd it really looks like a recap,\na repeat of what we've just seen, right?\n\n262\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.996\nUnix, that's what it really started on,\nbig machines, right.\n\n263\n00:15:02.996 --> 00:15:05.119\nMany users on them.\n\n264\n00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:07.815\nYou have what are known as\na server operating system and\n\n265\n00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:11.620\nwill talk a little bit more about what\nthat means in a second coming up.\n\n266\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.190\nLinux also has server based\noperating systems and\n\n267\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.990\nagain what you don't have somebody\nnecessarily sitting at these computers all\n\n268\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.980\nthe time because what they're typically\ndoing is providing a service for\n\n269\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.600\nmany other of the computers\nthat you will be sitting at.\n\n270\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.550\nWindows also has their server operating\nsystem, as well as OS X likewise.\n\n271\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.270\nSo those are some of the operating\nsystems that you might see in a corporate\n\n272\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.420\nenvironment.\n\n273\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.130\nNow that doesn't mean, lets talk a little,\njust briefly about what\n\n274\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.930\nwe mean when we say a client operating\nsystem versus a server operating system.\n\n275\n00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.721\nThe first ones that we showed you\nwe described were clients right.\n\n276\n00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:49.599\nWell a client is the computer that\nI'm sitting at my desk with right and\n\n277\n00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:53.147\nI'm doing most of my day to day work\nall my day to day tasks whether\n\n278\n00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:55.960\nI'm creating files or manipulating data.\n\n279\n00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.668\nBut then Ronnie's got a file that I need.\n\n280\n00:15:58.668 --> 00:15:59.520\nAll right?\n\n281\n00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.944\nSo, that file isn't on my computer,\nright, that file is out there.\n\n282\n00:16:03.944 --> 00:16:06.673\nRemember those computers that we\ntold you you're not sitting at, and\n\n283\n00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:08.260\nyou're not interacting with?\n\n284\n00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.680\nWell now they're going\nto provide a service.\n\n285\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.410\nSo my computer, as a client, is going to\nrequest a service, it's going to say,\n\n286\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.310\nhey out there!\n\n287\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.540\nAnybody on the network,\na computer out there?\n\n288\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.550\nDo you have that file that\nI need to get from Ronnie?\n\n289\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:25.310\nRight and a server operating system says\nyeah actually I can give you that file,\n\n290\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.310\nI've got that located right here on me.\n\n291\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.410\nSo a client is one that is\na fully self sufficient computer.\n\n292\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.670\nWe could unplug it from a network,\nwe could put it in a home environment,\n\n293\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.290\nit has nothing to do with the enterprise\nand do everything that we need it to do.\n\n294\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.440\nHowever in an enterprise environment,\n\n295\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.820\na lot of times we need to request\nservices that come from other computers.\n\n296\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.380\nAnd this is where the server\noperating system comes into play,\n\n297\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.840\nit's a fully self-sufficient machine,\ngot a lot of power in it,\n\n298\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.260\nlot of hardware like we talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n299\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.420\nBut what it's doing, is it's providing the\nservices that are being requested right.\n\n300\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.750\nYou say well what's requested,\nI need that file.\n\n301\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.640\nWell we've got a file server out there\nthat's running the same type of server or\n\n302\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.380\noperating system.\n\n303\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.600\nAnd it says you can find that file,\nhere's the file it's right here.\n\n304\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.640\nSo that's what we talk about when we\nsay a client operating system versus\n\n305\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.110\na server operating system, and you can see\nkind of an aspect of that right there too.\n\n306\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.950\nClient01 says, hey I need this file or\nI need to send an email,\n\n307\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.520\nwhere do I send the email?\n\n308\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.480\nI sent it to an operating system\nthat's running on a machine\n\n309\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.300\nthat just handles email,\nand it handles that for me.\n\n310\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.070\nSo those are the couple of different\ntypes of the operating systems that you\n\n311\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.720\nmight see.\n\n312\n00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.820\nHowever, that's not the only\noperating system that we have.\n\n313\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.816\nWe also have mobile operating systems\ntoo and I just label three of these,\n\n314\n00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:44.871\nremember iOS.\n\n315\n00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:49.055\nThis is one that runs on your iPhones,\nyour iPad if you will and\n\n316\n00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:51.210\nI believe even your iPods.\n\n317\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.310\nI'm not actually sure, I think it might\nrun on iPod but I know it runs on iPads,\n\n318\n00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.980\nI know it runs on iPhones.\n\n319\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.270\nWe also have the Android operating system\nlikewise so we wanna be aware now.\n\n320\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.170\nWhat's the difference between these?\n\n321\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.650\nThese typically are not the full\nblown desktop operating systems.\n\n322\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.260\nWhat these are typically running\non our mobile devices again right?\n\n323\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.210\nThey are running on hardware that\ndoesn't consume a lot of power and\n\n324\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.460\ndoesn't generate a lot of heat all right.\n\n325\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.420\nSo, definitely know a little about\nyour mobile operating systems.\n\n326\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.960\nNow the next thing that we have to talk\nabout, and I don't have a slide for\n\n327\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.340\nthis one is just\nthe different architecture.\n\n328\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.970\nNow, we've made mention of it when\nwe talked about the hardware.\n\n329\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.290\nWe talked about the system unit.\n\n330\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.880\nWe said you had to know\nthe difference between 32 bit and\n\n331\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.650\n64 bit in the architecture.\n\n332\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.530\nOne of the things Ronnie and\n\n333\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.580\nI mentioned is that's directly\nrelated to the software as well.\n\n334\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.460\nWell now we come back to that\nsame aspect and remember you\n\n335\n00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.020\nhave a 32 bit operating system, and you\nhave 64 bit operating systems, and that is\n\n336\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.200\nnot contingent on whether it's going\nto be a server or just a client, right?\n\n337\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.810\nWhat it really means for a, say, 32-bit\noperating system has a memory limitation.\n\n338\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.450\nIt means if I'm running a 32-bit OS,\nabbreviation for operating system,\n\n339\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.390\nI'm limited to the amount of RAM\nthat I can use the system memory,\n\n340\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.180\nthat temporary work space, right.\n\n341\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.470\nSo I'm limited to an amount of maybe\napplications I can have open at the same\n\n342\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.980\ntime, and we're limited to around 4 gigs.\n\n343\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.830\nThe 64 bit operating system doesn't\nhave that memory limitation\n\n344\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.740\nin the fact that we can use,\nI've seen boards now,\n\n345\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.610\nmotherboards now that go\nup to 64 gigs easily.\n\n346\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.490\nAs far as the amount of RAM they have,\nthey're very expensive, but\n\n347\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.110\nthey do have that ability.\n\n348\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.940\nI do mention one other one here because we\ndid talk about mobile operating systems.\n\n349\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.070\nAnd one of the things that common in\nthe mobile operating systems is another\n\n350\n00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.360\narchitecture called ARM.\n\n351\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.990\nJust understand that that's what the\nplatform base is for your iOS device is,\n\n352\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.520\nyour Android based operating system and\neven your Windows mobile\n\n353\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.570\noperating system likewise, so\ndefinitely know your architecture.\n\n354\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.910\nNow, I did mention the interface types but\nI haven't really shown you anything.\n\n355\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.180\nI showed you, I told you\nthe graphical user interface, right,\n\n356\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.760\nGUI, that crazy acronym.\n\n357\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.720\nI told you that there's\ntext based entrance,\n\n358\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.160\na text base that you can interact\nwith the operating system.\n\n359\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.740\nLet's go ahead and just take a second\nhere and show you what I mean.\n\n360\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.480\nHere we have them side by side,\nyou can see my cursor right here and\n\n361\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.360\nmy cursor's right there.\n\n362\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.250\nThat's the point and\nclick technology, right.\n\n363\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.420\nI could point anywhere\non this interface and\n\n364\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.640\nI get this nice little graphical readout.\n\n365\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.500\nBut that's not the only way I can\ninteract with the operating system, and\n\n366\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.080\nthis is the language,\n\n367\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.150\nthe way you type these in are different\nbetween the operating system, but\n\n368\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.480\nthe concept is still the same and\nthe fact that they are text-based entries.\n\n369\n00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:53.080\nSo for instance here, if I decided that\nmaybe I wanted to work on the desktop,\n\n370\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.390\nlike we're doing now, and I didn't wanna\ndo it in a graphical user interface.\n\n371\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.400\nWell, now, believe it or not,\njust through a couple of text based\n\n372\n00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.230\ncommands that we throw in here, I'm now\non the desktop and I'm working with it.\n\n373\n00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.420\nYou say, I don't believe you,\nthat's not really what's happening,\n\n374\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.700\nwell let me show you\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n375\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.630\nIf I decided to right click here, choose\nnew, and I decided to create a folder, and\n\n376\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.470\nI would say maybe we call this GUI folder.\n\n377\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.650\nRight?\nYou can see that there's a nice icon, and\n\n378\n00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.740\nI can open it up if I decide to.\n\n379\n00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.140\nI can right click in here, and\nI can choose maybe a new text document.\n\n380\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.910\nHere's my test text document.\n\n381\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.230\nAll right?\n\n382\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.950\nI can see that.\n\n383\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:38.720\nI can work with it.\n\n384\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.370\nI can see these icons.\n\n385\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:46.230\nWell, I can do the same thing\ninside of the text based interface,\n\n386\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.770\nif you will,\nknown as a command line in this case.\n\n387\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.840\nAnd I can do something like\nmaking a folder as well here.\n\n388\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.900\nMaybe I wanna do make a folder,\nand I say this is my CMB folder.\n\n389\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.040\nWhen I hit Enter, Look what happens\nunder the little icon that I have here,\n\n390\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.110\nI can now see that yes\nI did create a folder.\n\n391\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.900\nSo, notice that I am working with\nthe operating system even though it's text\n\n392\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.380\nbased, I can also see that yeah I got\nboth of those folders right there.\n\n393\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.970\nAll right?\n\n394\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.920\nAnd if I decided to, if I wanted to,\n\n395\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.770\nI could go a little bit farther here,\nand I could go in there, and I could,\n\n396\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.830\neven if I wanted to see that text\ndocument that we just created.\n\n397\n00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:29.490\nNotice that it looks like it just\ndisappeared there let's try that again.\n\n398\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:37.870\nNotice that it's right there test.r RTF,\nso those are a couple of the interfaces.\n\n399\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.710\nAgain pretty straight forward\nas far as what they are,\n\n400\n00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:45.220\nthe command line you can probably see\nwhy Windows started to become so famous,\n\n401\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.470\nbecause you have to know the syntax,\nhas to be just right, or\n\n402\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.150\nyou're not gonna be\nworking with the machine.\n\n403\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:56.310\nLet me show you something here,\nif I say, I'll just type Command.\n\n404\n00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.710\nAll right, notice that it says\ncommand is not recognized.\n\n405\n00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.770\nWell that tells me that I'm not typing it\nright, and that's one of the things that\n\n406\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.220\nmakes it difficult to work with one\nof these type of interfaces here.\n\n407\n00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.390\nSo definitely be careful on that one, and\n\n408\n00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.170\ndon't be scared of it for sure, but\ndo keep in mind that it is there.\n\n409\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.000\nThe other thing I wanna talk about is\njust a little bit of what's going on in\n\n410\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.820\nthe background, remember,\nnotice that I'm launching applications.\n\n411\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.660\nIn this case when I launch an application,\n\n412\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.710\nI'm telling Windows to launch\nWindows Explorer, all right.\n\n413\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.840\nWell you also have things that go on in\nthe background that are called processes,\n\n414\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.860\nyou have things like services, and\nwhat they allow, they run in the back row.\n\n415\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.990\nTypically we don't do anything with them,\nand they allow the operating system to do\n\n416\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.070\nits functionality, cuz there's a lot going\non in an operating system, much more than\n\n417\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.640\nwe have time for, or that you even need\nto know about in an episode like this.\n\n418\n00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.480\nBut I will give you an example of\nwhat I mean here just real briefly.\n\n419\n00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.070\nNotice that I've got\napplications running right here,\n\n420\n00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.520\nand application is something\nthat the user launches.\n\n421\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.522\nThat something that I,\nsay I wanted to run.\n\n422\n00:24:02.522 --> 00:24:06.590\nHowever processes,\nI didn't launch any of these.\n\n423\n00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.276\nThese are somethings that\ngo on in the background.\n\n424\n00:24:09.276 --> 00:24:12.613\nThis is the operating system\ntalking to the hardware and\n\n425\n00:24:12.613 --> 00:24:17.157\ndoing what it needs to do, in order to\nprovide me the functionality that I see\n\n426\n00:24:17.157 --> 00:24:20.310\nright here that allows\nme to use the computer.\n\n427\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.490\nAll right, we also have services as well.\n\n428\n00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.100\nAnother type of process if you will,\nthat's going on in the background.\n\n429\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.171\nAnd all of these things\nblend together to eventually\n\n430\n00:24:29.171 --> 00:24:33.301\nmake what we see as the interface that\nwe use to work with the computer.\n\n431\n00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:37.952\nSo keep in mind, kind of as a recap that\nyou've got two different interfaces,\n\n432\n00:24:37.952 --> 00:24:39.510\ncommonly and computing.\n\n433\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.370\nYou've got these text based interfaces,\nyou also\n\n434\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.210\nhave the graphical user interface,\nwhich we'll go much more in depth.\n\n435\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.340\nI'm not gonna leave you there and say,\n\n436\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.520\nokay now you guys know\nhow to work with Windows.\n\n437\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.740\nFor sure, but just know the basics.\n\n438\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.650\nThere we have the graphical\nuser interface,\n\n439\n00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.000\nI get the ability that\nI can use the cursor.\n\n440\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.140\nI can highlight things and I can see\nthese nice pretty little icons, right?\n\n441\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.600\nA little more visually rich interface,\nif you will,\n\n442\n00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.510\nversus something like this over here that\nwe see that is really just text based.\n\n443\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.230\nAnd you have to know what the text\nis in order to work with it.\n\n444\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.634\nIf you don't know what those\ntext based commands are, then,\n\n445\n00:25:15.634 --> 00:25:20.083\nwell, it's going to make is a little bit\nmore difficult, which is why you can see\n\n446\n00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:23.697\nthe graphical user interface\nbecoming a little bit more secure.\n\n447\n00:25:23.697 --> 00:25:26.893\nMaybe the last thing I will mention,\nI know I mention these all through and\n\n448\n00:25:26.893 --> 00:25:29.540\nwe are going to probably\nhear about them again.\n\n449\n00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.440\nI wanna mention drivers because it is\nimportant in your operating system,\n\n450\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.900\nit's another critical component.\n\n451\n00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.810\nRemember that the operating system needs\nto know how to talk to the hardware.\n\n452\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.880\nSo we need a component that\ntranslates the operating system,\n\n453\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.270\nwhat it's saying,\nto what the hardware responds to, right.\n\n454\n00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.755\nAnd that's where your driver sits there it\nsits down there in the kernel there and\n\n455\n00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:51.769\nit talks and\ncommunicates with the hardware.\n\n456\n00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:54.398\nAnd it basically is nothing more\nthan a translator that says okay\n\n457\n00:25:54.398 --> 00:25:56.780\noperating system what\nare you telling me you need.\n\n458\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.070\nOkay let me go ahead I'll go back here and\nI'll talk to the hardware and\n\n459\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.250\nthen I'll give you your output back and\nthen we can display that on the monitor.\n\n460\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.890\nSo another crucial component just\nlike those services, applications and\n\n461\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.390\nprocesses that are running\nthat you should be aware of.\n\n462\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.510\nKeep in mind that one of the things\nthat you wanna remember is that\n\n463\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.870\nthose drivers are there.\n\n464\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.213\nSo Ronnie, that's pretty much got\nit unless you can think of anything\n\n465\n00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:21.924\nelse that you might wanna throw in.\n\n466\n00:26:21.924 --> 00:26:25.373\nJust remember the interface, one of the\neasiest interfaces to work with typically\n\n467\n00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:26.852\nis the graphical user interface and\n\n468\n00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:30.750\nthat's pretty much where you're gonna\nfind yourself most of the time.\n\n469\n00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.645\n>> Just take a moment here and remember\nthat regardless of the device that you're\n\n470\n00:26:34.645 --> 00:26:38.067\non, whether you're on a smart phone,\nwhether you're on a tablet,\n\n471\n00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:42.219\nwhether you're working with desktops or\nlaptops or even working with computers.\n\n472\n00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:46.485\nThat you do not see on a daily basis,\nthere's gonna be some type of operating\n\n473\n00:26:46.485 --> 00:26:50.390\nsystem working in the background\nto ensure that it happens.\n\n474\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.110\nWe use desktop operating systems so\nthat we can interact\n\n475\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.550\nwith the computer in front of us and\ndo the things that we need to.\n\n476\n00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.712\nBut there may be information that you and\nI do not have direct contact with, but\n\n477\n00:27:00.712 --> 00:27:02.780\nwe still need that information.\n\n478\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.700\nAnd that's when we would\nend up connecting to,\n\n479\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.250\nwell, something like\na server operating system.\n\n480\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.590\nAnd the difference there between that\ndesktop and that server operating system.\n\n481\n00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.590\nWell one needs human\ninteraction which is a desktop.\n\n482\n00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.010\nAnd the server operating system,\n\n483\n00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.710\nsince it's also running software, it can\nhandle commands when I request a file.\n\n484\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.030\nIt doesn't have to stop and wait for\na user to say yes you can have it.\n\n485\n00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.430\nIt knows how to handle that for us and so\n\n486\n00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.340\nthat type doesn't need\na direct human interaction.\n\n487\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.740\nBut if you're on your smartphone,\nif you're on your tablet they all have\n\n488\n00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.960\ndifferent operating systems on them and\nthey also need to be maintained as well.\n\n489\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.370\nAnd actually some things especially\nif we connect in multiple peripherals\n\n490\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.400\nwe have to deal with drivers too.\n\n491\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.329\nSo just kind of realize that there's a lot\nmore coming up specifically on dealing\n\n492\n00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:47.487\nwith an operating system but\nat least here.\n\n493\n00:27:47.487 --> 00:27:50.827\nYou do understand that there are many\ndifferent types and that we will be\n\n494\n00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:54.750\nencountering them just about everyday\nof our working life with computing.\n\n495\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.910\n>> Well that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n496\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.330\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n497\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.330\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n498\n00:28:02.330 -->

host\n\n3\n00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.916\nRonnie Wong, and you're watching\nthe IC3 computing fundamental show,\n\n4\n00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:24.317\nwhere we're about to get a little bit more\nin depth into operating systems, and talk\n\n5\n00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:28.560\nsome of the ways that we can customize\nit and also work with a little bit more.\n\n6\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.070\nAnd who better help us and Mr.\nWindows himself Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.240\nWes welcome back with us.\n\n8\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.450\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, that's right\ngreat to be here with the ITProTV crew.\n\n9\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.210\nThat's right we're gonna be looking at the\noperating system, we been talking about.\n\n10\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.380\nWhat an operating system is, we've been\ntalking about our hardware, and mentioning\n\n11\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.200\nthat collectively the two of those\ntogether makes an information system,\n\n12\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.720\nbut we really haven't shown too much\n\n13\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.190\ninformation inside of\nthe operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.930\nSo let's go ahead and dive in here.\n\n15\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.210\nThe first primary interface that we deal\nwith, especially in a Windows world,\n\n16\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.300\nis what's known as the desktop, and\nthis is the graphical user interface.\n\n17\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.610\nKeep in mind, guys,\nthat we're gonna be talking about,\n\n18\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.100\nthere's plenty of information about\ndealing with the command line interface.\n\n19\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.180\nKeep in mind it's a little bit more\nadvanced, it's probably not something that\n\n20\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.760\nif you're just starting out that you're\nreally gonna wanna dive into, it is there.\n\n21\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.530\nBut we definitely want to look a the\ngraphical user interface,and pretty much\n\n22\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.420\nwhat the majority of people who are in\nthe computing environment deal with.\n\n23\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Well wen we start taking a look at the\nidea here of talking about the desktop and\n\n24\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.760\ngetting used to this, most of us, if we\nhave actually been switching careers from\n\n25\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.960\none career to another, now we're\nactually dealing with a computer system.\n\n26\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930\nIt may be a little bit overwhelming\nto realize where things are and\n\n27\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.150\nwhere they're laid out.\n\n28\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.110\nWhat Wes is gonna do, is he's going to\nhelp us to feel a bit more comfortable in\n\n29\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.700\nthe interface, and then show us some of\nthe details that we may actually need to\n\n30\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170\nchange, or want to change to make\nit suit us a little bit better.\n\n31\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.450\nIn most environments, even though they\ngive us a static or, I shouldn't say\n\n32\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.370\nstatic, a preconfigured interface and\nwe might think it has to be that way.\n\n33\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.740\nThere's a lot of customization that\nyou can do To make it fill or,\n\n34\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.980\nI should say feel or\nfit better to what you're actually doing.\n\n35\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.130\nAnd so West is gonna help us out just in\ncase we get a little bit overwhelmed,\n\n36\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.230\nwith some of us just, just change this and\nthis, we don't know exactly what to do.\n\n37\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.598\nWell, West is gonna help us to do that.\n\n38\n00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:24.990\nAll right, and let's go ahead and dive in.\n\n39\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.550\nAnd the first thing, let me go ahead and\n\n40\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.300\nshow you what Ronnie was talking about\nwhen he said preconfigured interface.\n\n41\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940\nHe said well I didn't configure anything.\n\n42\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.930\nWell when you do a normal\ninstallation of an operating system,\n\n43\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.880\nit starts up those preconfigurations\nare commonly what we consider defaults.\n\n44\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.060\nAnd you gotta keep in mind\nthat the default nature,\n\n45\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.550\ndefault nature of any operating system or\napplication could be good for some but\n\n46\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.470\nnot might be good for everybody.\n\n47\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890\nKeep in mind this also this\ncalled personal computing, so\n\n48\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.390\nwhatever is personal computing\nexperience that makes it better\n\n49\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.740\nis gonna be right option for you.\n\n50\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.650\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n51\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.450\nSo the desktop, this is what he was\ntalking about when he said default, right?\n\n52\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.440\nThis is the standard preconfigured\ninterface, this is the primary enter,\n\n53\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.910\nor entrance point if you will into your\nwhole entire computing environment.\n\n54\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.700\nOne of the great things about the desktop,\nis that there's a lot of information that\n\n55\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.980\nyou don't see here, but you can find\nout Just by simply hovering over icons.\n\n56\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.020\nNow what we see up here in the upper left\nhand corner is what's known as an icon,\n\n57\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.890\nall right, icons can be changed in size.\n\n58\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.330\nThey can really, any application you want\nyou can make an icon on the desktop.\n\n59\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.250\nYou can create files and\nfolders, which will look at but\n\n60\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.680\nthe icons generally tell you\na little bit about the application.\n\n61\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.410\nAnd as you can see here, if I really zoom\nin there I haven't done anything I just\n\n62\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.700\nhovered over that little icon, and\nin this case it let's me know it says hey,\n\n63\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.760\nif I delete anything it's\ngonna go to this location.\n\n64\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600\nSo, when you do delete something\nlet me show you what I mean\n\n65\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490\nI walk you through exactly what I'm doing\nstep by step here In just a second.\n\n66\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.170\nI won't leave you hanging on this guys,\nbut let me just show you that\n\n67\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.710\nfirst icon and how it, when you're\nhovering over it it tells you something.\n\n68\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.080\nLet's go ahead and we'll just call this\na test and you just make another icon.\n\n69\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.425\nNotice that,\nhere's the second icon that we got.\n\n70\n00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:14.065\nIn this case it tells me that\nit is a text document and look,\n\n71\n00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:17.365\nI'm harboring over it and\nit gives me a lot of information about it.\n\n72\n00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:20.075\nSo that's the great thing, is this\nthe first time that you've ever done this?\n\n73\n00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:22.380\nAnd the first time you've even ever,\nseen a desktop?\n\n74\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.370\nThere giving you a lot of information\nright out the gate just by simply\n\n75\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970\ntaking what's known as\nthe cursor right here.\n\n76\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.210\nThis little guy here,\nthis is called the cursor, and\n\n77\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.180\nit's the way that we can manipulate and\nwork with the operating system.\n\n78\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.330\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nwhat I'm gonna do is,\n\n79\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.660\nthis is called a right click what\nI'm doing now here on the desktop.\n\n80\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.140\nAnd when you do a right click, you get\nwhat's known as an options menu here.\n\n81\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.490\nIn this option menu, you can see\nwe've got quite a few options here.\n\n82\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.550\nIn this case we'll go through\nthese here in a second guys.\n\n83\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.420\nWhat I want to show you is just\nI'm going to delete this file.\n\n84\n00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.440\nIt's asking me hey are you\nsure you want to do this,\n\n85\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.880\nbecause remember delete operation you\nmight not be able to get it back, but\n\n86\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.100\nnow if we jump back here notice\nthat the icon itself has changed.\n\n87\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.890\nIt's got something in it, and now I can\nsee that I've definitely got something in\n\n88\n00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.650\nthis case what's known as the recycle bin\nwhere you delete files all right, and\n\n89\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.620\nif I decide to, again another right click.\n\n90\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.740\nNow notice how the right\nclick options change.\n\n91\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.870\nDid you see that?\n\n92\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.860\nVersus if I'm out here on a desktop and\nI decide that, hey, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n93\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.430\nright click, I do get a set of options,\nbut they are different.\n\n94\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.560\nNow that means that the context in which\nthese options are available really\n\n95\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.390\nchange depending on where you're\nclicking along your desktop.\n\n96\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.280\nSo you do have to pay attention to that,\nbut again\n\n97\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.500\nnotice that just by hovering over an icon\nI can get a little bit of information.\n\n98\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.260\nIf I right click and I choose Empty and\n\n99\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.140\ngive it just a second there,\nmaybe I didn't click.\n\n100\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.370\nAnd you know what, it's warning me,\n\n101\n00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.010\nit's saying hey are you sure you\nwanna permanently delete this file?\n\n102\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.430\nSo these are what is known\nas dialog boxes, and\n\n103\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.480\nwe'll take a second here just\nto kinda look at a dialog box.\n\n104\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.420\nYou can get these all over the place,\nand in many different contexts too,\n\n105\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.260\nan application that you're doing something\nyou might say hey are you sure you wanna\n\n106\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.400\ndo this and it gives you a dialog box.\n\n107\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.020\nNotice that in the upper right\nhand corner you've got this red x.\n\n108\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.770\nWell the red x basically says\nhey we can close that out or\n\n109\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.180\nwe can yes or we can say no.\n\n110\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.950\nBut keep in mind that the yes and\n\n111\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.010\nno always depends on the information\nit's giving you in the dialog box.\n\n112\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.360\nAcross the top of the dialog box here\nis what's known as the title bar.\n\n113\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.650\nTitle bar tells you what application or\n\n114\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.750\nwhat operation you're\nkinda performing here.\n\n115\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.040\nAnd we'll go ahead and these buttons\ndown here now, these buttons,\n\n116\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.400\noops, get it there.\n\n117\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.820\nThere we go.\nThese buttons right here are clickable and\n\n118\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.580\nthey can change in what they are as\nwell depending on the application\n\n119\n00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.140\nthat you're running.\n\n120\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.820\nI'm gonna go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n121\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.320\nWe'll back out and you'll notice now\nthat this icon up here has changed.\n\n122\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.820\nIt's letting me know, for\nus that it is now empty.\n\n123\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.080\nSo, a little bit about the desktop\nis the fact that you can do\n\n124\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.180\na lot of stuff right here, without every\neven getting into the operating system.\n\n125\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.710\nIf you're aware of what's going on.\n\n126\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.570\nNow, I do want to take a second look\na little bit more at the desktop and\n\n127\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.590\nshow you some of these options here.\n\n128\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.210\nNow these options, like I said,\ndepending on where you right click,\n\n129\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.270\nthey will change, in this case,\nthese are the options that are available\n\n130\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.435\nfrom the desktop itself, and\nyou can see that View here.\n\n131\n00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:14.865\nHere, notice that I have medium icons.\n\n132\n00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:18.765\nThis is more of what Ronnie was talking\nabout, the preconfigured nature of this,\n\n133\n00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:20.225\nthat these are the defaults.\n\n134\n00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:22.635\nWell, if you're like me and\nyou've got four eyes,\n\n135\n00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:26.965\nmaybe [LAUGH] you need those icons to\nbe a little bit bigger, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:26.965 --> 00:07:29.605\nSo you can switch that, and\nnotice what you're doing here.\n\n137\n00:07:29.605 --> 00:07:32.185\nNotice that the size of\nthe icon has changed.\n\n138\n00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:36.970\nIn fact, let me do that again here so\nyou can see that it does change, and\n\n139\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.780\nif I choose medium,\nnotice how the icon changes there as well.\n\n140\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.200\nSo if you're somebody again\nthat may be has a little bit\n\n141\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.220\nhard of a time seeing this icon,\nyou can make them a little bit bigger.\n\n142\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.980\nYou can arrange icons too.\n\n143\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.575\nSo let me show you some\nmore of the options.\n\n144\n00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:57.186\nI'll tell you what Since we're gonna do\na Sort By and a View, let's go ahead,\n\n145\n00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:59.181\nand we're gonna create a couple of files.\n\n146\n00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.196\nSo, I'm just scrolling\ndown to the New option.\n\n147\n00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.295\nWe'll talk about what some\nof these options are.\n\n148\n00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.173\nI'm not gonna name any of these files but\n\n149\n00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.503\nI'm gonna kinda put them\nall over the place here.\n\n150\n00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:11.773\nWe'll choose New,\nlet's see, what will we do?\n\n151\n00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:14.590\nWe'll do another type of document.\n\n152\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:22.840\nI'm not even gonna name them, I'll talk\nabout naming files in a second here too.\n\n153\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.610\nAll right, so\nnow notice that I've got these, and\n\n154\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.050\nthese are all kinda all over the place,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.461\nNow, if I choose that right-click again,\nand I decide that I wanna View by,\n\n156\n00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:38.909\nI wanna do things like arrange to grid,\nI wanna do auto arrange, I can do this.\n\n157\n00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.218\nAnd when I select this,\n\n158\n00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:44.682\nit's basically gonna arrange the items\naccording to what the option says here.\n\n159\n00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:47.640\nNotice that you get this\na little arrow next to View.\n\n160\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.580\nThat arrow lets you know that\nthere's another sub-menu.\n\n161\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.680\nWe got the Options menu here, and\nthen we have what are known as sub-menus.\n\n162\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.365\nAnd sometimes the sub-menus can get very,\n\n163\n00:08:56.365 --> 00:09:01.175\nyou can end up having an Option\nmenu that's taking up\n\n164\n00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:04.615\nthe majority of the screen depending\non how many sub-menus you have here.\n\n165\n00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:08.711\nNow, if we back out a little bit and\nI decide that I wanna do an auto arrange,\n\n166\n00:09:08.711 --> 00:09:11.718\nnotice it looks like my icons\ndisappear from the view.\n\n167\n00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:16.720\nBut if I back out here, notice that\nit's got them in a column, right.\n\n168\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.744\nAnd if I look at them,\nit just basically arranged them for me.\n\n169\n00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:23.960\nNow here's the thing, with an auto\narrange, when I move them out and\n\n170\n00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.829\nI try to put them in a weird spot,\nright, they snap right back.\n\n171\n00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:31.196\nAnd that's just to help to keep your\ndesktop a little more organized if\n\n172\n00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.030\nyou want.\n\n173\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.350\nYou can also do things like, for instance,\n\n174\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.980\nif you wanna do some sorting here,\nyou could do a Sort by.\n\n175\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.680\nAnd if I do a Sort by, you can see\nthe different options here, right?\n\n176\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.340\nWe're gonna do Name here.\n\n177\n00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.570\nAnd if I go over here and\nI look the name, all right,\n\n178\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.890\nit's kinda [LAUGH] interesting on this.\n\n179\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.550\nNotice how it's arranged them, right?\n\n180\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.910\nAnd there again, look at me hovering\nme over this and it's telling me what\n\n181\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.500\nthe information about the file and, in\nthis case, the icon that's on the desktop.\n\n182\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.730\nIt's giving me a little bit of\ninformation about that icon in general.\n\n183\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.830\nNow, the other thing that you can do,\nyou might have noticed, and\n\n184\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.030\nlet me take that auto\narrange off of there.\n\n185\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.120\nI personally,\nI don't really like that here, but\n\n186\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.320\nnotice that I'm moving the icons\nalong the desktop, right?\n\n187\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.340\nWell, what is that doing for,\nhow am I doing that?\n\n188\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.540\nWell that is a left-click and hold.\n\n189\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.680\nAnd while you're holding that left-click,\n\n190\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.250\nyou can drag this around where\nyou want on the desktop itself.\n\n191\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:34.580\nYou can also do things like moving\nmultiple items at the same time.\n\n192\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.760\nI can do a left-click and\nI can hold here on the desktop, right?\n\n193\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.870\nAnd see how it's\nhighlighting all of those?\n\n194\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.450\nNow these are in what's called a grouping,\nright?\n\n195\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.759\nAnd when they're selected here in\na grouping, now if I left-click, drag and\n\n196\n00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.958\nhold, I want you to notice\nthat I'm actually dragging and\n\n197\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.587\nmoving every single item\nthat I selected here.\n\n198\n00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:55.207\nAnd we can do that.\n\n199\n00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:59.464\nNow, you also have to be careful too\nbecause when you right-click now on an,\n\n200\n00:10:59.464 --> 00:11:01.918\nlet me go ahead and re-select those there.\n\n201\n00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:05.253\nAnd you right-click on a grouping\nthat has been selected,\n\n202\n00:11:05.253 --> 00:11:10.004\nyou get some other options here like\nRotate clockwise, Rotate counterclockwise.\n\n203\n00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:14.814\nBut you probably noticed that we've seen\nthree different Options menus here by\n\n204\n00:11:14.814 --> 00:11:16.968\nright-clicking on the desktop and\n\n205\n00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:20.211\nwe've really just selected\nthree different icons.\n\n206\n00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:21.753\nRight, the desktop itself,\n\n207\n00:11:21.753 --> 00:11:25.590\nwe've looked at the one of the icons\nknown as the Recycling Bin and a file.\n\n208\n00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.560\nAnd they're all three\ndifferent Option menus.\n\n209\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.260\nSo again, it's contextually sensitive\nbased on what it is that you're selecting.\n\n210\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.790\nNow be careful when you select\nall of these items like this,\n\n211\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.040\ncuz notice the Delete option.\n\n212\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.390\nWhen I choose Delete, and back out here,\nnotice the dialog box changes.\n\n213\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.990\nSo again,\nwe've got another type of dialog box and\n\n214\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.320\nyou can see that it's telling you\nyou're deleting multiple items.\n\n215\n00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.410\nThat is something to understand.\n\n216\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.800\nAnd again, we can say Yes or No.\n\n217\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.260\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose Yes to\nthis and I want you to see that I can,\n\n218\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:03.510\nnow I have deleted every single one\nof those files all in one Delete.\n\n219\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.380\nOkay, so be careful when you\ngroup these together and\n\n220\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.560\nyou decide to delete all of those files.\n\n221\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.870\nSo that kinda shows you a little\nbit around the desktop.\n\n222\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.720\nThere's some other things,\nRonnie, that we wanna check out.\n\n223\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.480\nBecause I have said that this\nis your first entry point into\n\n224\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.430\nthe operating system,\nit's the first thing you see.\n\n225\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.810\nBut we can go even more in depth with\nthe operating system as well, too.\n\n226\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what we wanna take a look\nat next is that there's a few other\n\n227\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.450\noptions that you normally\nencounter on that desktop.\n\n228\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.390\nWhich is not only\nthe background that you see and\n\n229\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.960\nhow to arrange things on that desktop like\nyou had a physical desktop environment.\n\n230\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.580\nBut also how do you begin to launch\nthings like applications and\n\n231\n00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.030\nother utilities that are there.\n\n232\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.010\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe're going to cover those.\n\n233\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.650\nAnd then there's actually the bar across\nthe bottom that has a lot of information.\n\n234\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.580\nSo Wes, what do we need to\nknow about those things?\n\n235\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.886\n&gt;&gt; The first one has been labelled,\nit's been around since 1995,\n\n236\n00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:56.527\nway back in Windows 95.\n\n237\n00:12:56.527 --> 00:13:00.245\nThis is something that kinda\nrevolutionized how we look at graphical\n\n238\n00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:01.279\nuser interfaces.\n\n239\n00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:04.797\nAnd it doesn't say it anymore but\nif we take a look at my screen, again,\n\n240\n00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:07.770\nwe're just kinda doing a little\nbit of a hover, right?\n\n241\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.640\nWe haven't clicked on anything.\n\n242\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.434\nAnd you might notice that if I do hover,\nI'll tell you what, give me a second here,\n\n243\n00:13:14.434 --> 00:13:17.395\nI probably should've had\nthis setup before hand.\n\n244\n00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:21.307\nAnd I wanna go ahead and take a second\nhere and just adjust my mouse real quick\n\n245\n00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:24.925\nand then we'll get into some of\nthe fun stuff that we're doing here.\n\n246\n00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:28.410\nBut let me go ahead and do that real\nquick and now I can highlight a little\n\n247\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.750\nbit easier and show you guys\nwhat I am talking about here.\n\n248\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.810\nAll right, notice that when I hover\nover this little button here, right?\n\n249\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.400\nNotice that it says Start.\n\n250\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.350\nWell that might be a key indicator\nit's the first place on the desktop\n\n251\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.480\nthat you might wanna go.\n\n252\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.670\nAnd this is what's known as the Start\nbutton that leads you to the Start menu.\n\n253\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.620\nNow in earlier versions of the operating\nsystem, you might have seen a button,\n\n254\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.880\ngoing back to like maybe XP and\nXP's no longer supported.\n\n255\n00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.550\nBut there was an actual Start button and\nit said Start on it.\n\n256\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.270\nNow, today, it's an icon and\neven today in Windows 10,\n\n257\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.450\nwhich we're not really gonna\ndeal with too much here,\n\n258\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.400\nyou'll see it's actually like a four pane,\nlittle window pane.\n\n259\n00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.590\nBut notice this is what is\nknown as the Start menu.\n\n260\n00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.390\nAnd it is, like Ronnie said,\n\n261\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.120\nit's kinda like the launching point for\napplications and the utilities.\n\n262\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.360\nAnd even locating your own personal files\nthat you maybe have stored on the machine.\n\n263\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:29.290\nSo it's a good entry point into Windows\noutside of just the basic desktop.\n\n264\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.501\nNow, on this left-hand side,\nthis is actually configurable,\n\n265\n00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:37.639\nyou can modify in this white area here.\n\n266\n00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:41.285\nAnd the colors could change, we're gonna\nshow you a little bit about customization\n\n267\n00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:42.580\nof the desktop too coming up.\n\n268\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.420\nBut this is, you're able to modify this,\nthe user is.\n\n269\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.640\nHowever, this side,\nthere's not a lot that you can customize.\n\n270\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.260\nYou'll see some options here like,\nfor instance,\n\n271\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.570\nI can see the username\nthat's currently logged in.\n\n272\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.200\nAnd notice that, again, hovering over\nthis, I'm not clicking anything.\n\n273\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.220\nIt says open your personal folder.\n\n274\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.120\nSo that might tell me that if I want to\ngo where my documents might be stored,\n\n275\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.110\nwell it's telling me this.\n\n276\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.310\nThat's what it's gonna do.\n\n277\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.670\nAnd again, if I open up Documents,\nnotice that it says just more information,\n\n278\n00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.295\nletting me know where it's gonna take me.\n\n279\n00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:20.430\nBut this side, this right-hand side\nof what's called the Start menu,\n\n280\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.840\nhas a very limited\nconfiguration that you can do.\n\n281\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.680\nI will tell you that there are some\ntools that you can add to this for\n\n282\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.220\npeople like administrators that wanna\nget to them a little bit easier.\n\n283\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.320\nBut outside of that,\nthat's really all you can do.\n\n284\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.800\nHowever, if I want to,\n\n285\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.180\nI can launch applications from either\nside really, when it comes down to it.\n\n286\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.560\nBut on the left-hand side, I can\nlaunch the applications that I want to\n\n287\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.890\njust by hovering over them and\ndoing a left-click with your mouse.\n\n288\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.001\nYou could see here I\nlaunched up the calculator.\n\n289\n00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:56.316\nAnd as Ronnie is very familiar with,\nand maybe you're not,\n\n290\n00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:59.826\nI need one of these things because\nof my impeccable math skills.\n\n291\n00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:02.167\nSo that is a very good utility [LAUGH] for\nme.\n\n292\n00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:03.523\nBut notice that I did launch that.\n\n293\n00:16:03.523 --> 00:16:07.336\nNow what if I'm What if I\ndon't need the calculator,\n\n294\n00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:10.150\nwhat if I'm like an Einstein, maybe?\n\n295\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.950\nI don't need the calculator.\n\n296\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.860\nDoes that mean that I have to\nkeep it on the Start menu?\n\n297\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.370\nRemember, I told you this\nside is customizable.\n\n298\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.580\nHere we go with the right-click again,\nand again, this is an options menu, and\n\n299\n00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.470\nnotice how it's changed.\n\n300\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.660\nNow we're up to our fourth option\nmenu that completely different.\n\n301\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.630\nLike I said it's really based on what\nit is that you are right-clicking on.\n\n302\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:35.660\nNoticed that it says Pin to the Taskbar\nand it says Pin to the Start Menu,\n\n303\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.070\nwe're gonna talk about that in a second.\n\n304\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.990\nBut it also says Remove from this list.\n\n305\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.100\nSo if I not using the calculator,\nI just remove from the list and\n\n306\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.030\nlook here, it is gone.\n\n307\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.760\nWell, what did it mean when it said pin\nto the Start menu, what does that mean?\n\n308\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.590\nWell let me show you.\n\n309\n00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.370\nLet's take another application here.\n\n310\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.000\nThis is a basic application\nthat's inside of Windows,\n\n311\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.450\nbeen inside of Windows for a while.\n\n312\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.120\nThis is the Paint application.\n\n313\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.320\nAnd if I decide to do a right-click,\nI can pin it to the Start menu.\n\n314\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.840\nWell, it disappeared, you say, well Wes,\n\n315\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.980\nI thought you were pinning that to\nthe Start menu, where did it go?\n\n316\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.190\nWell, if I zoom it back up here,\nnotice it's up here at the top.\n\n317\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.320\nNow, this is a little bit different, this\nis interesting, it's kind of hard to see,\n\n318\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.930\nif I zoom in here, notice, how there's\nthis little line right here, now,\n\n319\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.310\nthis is a dividing line between\nGetting Started here and Paint.\n\n320\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.600\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n321\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.850\nWell that means that if I decide that\nI wanna clear this whole entire list,\n\n322\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.180\nwhich you can do.\n\n323\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.956\nI decide I don't want any recently used,\nby the way I should mention,\n\n324\n00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:35.665\nthese are the recently used programs and\nI don't want to see this.\n\n325\n00:17:35.665 --> 00:17:40.034\nWell, I can clear this whole entire list,\nbut\n\n326\n00:17:40.034 --> 00:17:44.976\nsince I have pinned Paint,\nit's gonna stay there.\n\n327\n00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:49.369\nSo, this is a good way to get to maybe\nsome of the applications you used all\n\n328\n00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:50.025\nthe time.\n\n329\n00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:53.345\nI'll show you what\nthe alternative would be.\n\n330\n00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:57.220\nLet say we remove this\nfrom the list completely.\n\n331\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.340\nNow it's gone, and I've still recently\nused it so it's still in the list but\n\n332\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.550\nnotice what happens when I\ncompletely remove it from the list.\n\n333\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.070\nNow I have to go find it.\n\n334\n00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.170\nNotice there it's not in that list,\nso now you have to\n\n335\n00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.380\nhave a working knowledge of where\nit is within the operating system.\n\n336\n00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.315\nAnd I have to go to All Programs,\nlet's see here.\n\n337\n00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:19.690\nI'm putting myself on the spot Ronnie,\nlet me see if I can remember.\n\n338\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.650\nAccessories and there is Paint.\n\n339\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.450\nNow, that is not really too difficult,\nI do understand that.\n\n340\n00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.320\nBut if you are starting out for\nthe first time, or\n\n341\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.860\nyou are supporting somebody that\nis computer illiterate, and\n\n342\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.720\nthat is not talking down to anybody,\nyou can learn this.\n\n343\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.115\nThat could be a very,\nvery frustrating thing.\n\n344\n00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.350\nWhere'd my application go,\nI'm used to seeing it.\n\n345\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.600\nAll I have to do is push this\nlittle button on the desktop and\n\n346\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.620\nit is right there.\n\n347\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.420\nWell, fear not cuz we can bring it back.\n\n348\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.750\nIf we right click on it again,\nI've got this Pin to the Start Menu.\n\n349\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.510\nAnd we don't have a 2\nAM fire alarm going off\n\n350\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:19:00.490\nanymore because we can't find our\nPaint option, and it is right there.\n\n351\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.950\nSo you can customize this side,\nthese are operating system\n\n352\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:11.130\ndefined locations that you can go into,\nand again you can launch different areas.\n\n353\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.900\nDo wanna show you one other one here too,\n\n354\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.842\nwe're gonna get more into some\nof these technologies coming up.\n\n355\n00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:18.790\nBut maybe need to know how\nto shut the machine down.\n\n356\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.050\nThat might be something that you need to\ndo from time to time, well you're gonna\n\n357\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.930\nhave to know how to do this and like I've\ntold you the context menu does change.\n\n358\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.730\nAnd you'll notice that it's telling me\nI can Switch user, Log off, Lock or\n\n359\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.220\nRestart the machine or put it into\na low power mode known as Sleep.\n\n360\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.290\nMight save me some energy.\n\n361\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.440\nSo, Ronnie that's the Start Menu that's\nthe first big entry point in there.\n\n362\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.820\nUse it know that you can customize it,\nthis a little bit more advanced but\n\n363\n00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.720\nI do wanna just take a second and\nshow you this.\n\n364\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.180\nIf I right click on that Start Menu I\ncan choose Properties, and then from\n\n365\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.840\nthe Properties here we get the ability\nto do a lot more customization here.\n\n366\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.770\nNotice that it says Store and\n\n367\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.880\ndisplay recently opened\nprograms in the Start menu?\n\n368\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.820\nIf I clear that,\n\n369\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.220\nthis might put the pinning the application\nto the Start menu in context for us.\n\n370\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.920\nLet's go ahead and choose OK to that.\n\n371\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.200\nGo back to our start menu and\nvoila, look at that,\n\n372\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.750\nwe have a blank start menu\non the left hand side.\n\n373\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.970\nBut even though I said\nclear those applications,\n\n374\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.260\nnotice that paint is still here at the top\nbecause I pinned it to the start menu.\n\n375\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.055\nSo very good way, good entry point,\n\n376\n00:20:24.055 --> 00:20:26.900\nwe'll talk about some more of these coming\nup because there are some additional\n\n377\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.840\nconfigurations that you can do that\nare all launched from the start menu.\n\n378\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.560\nNow, Wes we also have of course\nthe idea of the task bar.\n\n379\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.100\nWhich is that bar down at the bottom\nthat not only houses the Start menu, but\n\n380\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.450\nI saw several icons and then over on\nthe right hand side of the screen\n\n381\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.950\nI saw some different things there to.\n\n382\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so what are those about?\n\n383\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.560\nWell let's start from our left and\nwe'll work to the right here.\n\n384\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.140\nNotice, well we've already looked\nat the start menu or itself.\n\n385\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.850\nThe little icon there that allows\nme to launch that start menu.\n\n386\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.350\nWhat are these about?\n\n387\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.940\nAll right, well these are different\napplications that I've decided, well I say\n\n388\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.450\nI've decided, let me back up here, Windows\nhave decided during its installation,\n\n389\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.970\nits default, that these are things\nthat you're gonna be using a lot, so\n\n390\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.490\nthey put them here as what\nare known as quick launch icons.\n\n391\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.720\nnotice that I had to, even if I\nhave something on the Start menu,\n\n392\n00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.790\nI still got one click, then two clicks,\nand I could open up paint.\n\n393\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.330\nHowever, if I decide to\nuse the other option\n\n394\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.800\nYou'll see it right there Pin to Taskbar.\n\n395\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.150\nNotice that I'm gonna get now\na fourth icon on the taskbar.\n\n396\n00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.280\nYou see that there?\n\n397\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.510\nOops, that's the Windows Taskbar or\nMac taskbar, we don't need that.\n\n398\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.350\nNotice that I now have this\nlittle color pallet that's there.\n\n399\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.280\nWhy is that?\n\n400\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.780\nWell I can do a quick launch of Paint now.\n\n401\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.020\nSo if I decide that I want\nto get to something quicker,\n\n402\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.780\nhence the name quick launch,\nI can launch it from this icon.\n\n403\n00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.720\nAnd when it opens up, notice that\nI didn't have push the Start menu.\n\n404\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.030\nI certainly didn't have to go down there\nand do Accessories, where just seen me go.\n\n405\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.460\nSo this is a quick launch icon.\n\n406\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.460\nAnd you can move these around,\nyou can modify them, you can remove them.\n\n407\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:18.598\nAgain, remember the right-click, notice\nthat we can unpin this from the taskbar.\n\n408\n00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:22.690\nYou say well, wait a second I don't\nreally use Window's Media Player,\n\n409\n00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.100\nI know that Windows put that on there by\ndefault, can I take that off of there?\n\n410\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.620\nWell, you can, I can unpin it and\nI can customize it.\n\n411\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.680\nRemember, every aspect\nof this is customizable.\n\n412\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.180\nNow the other thing that\nwe can do is we can also\n\n413\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.330\ngo over here to the right-hand side.\n\n414\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.930\nAnd I know my head's kinda covering it up\nthere, but if we check out the right-hand\n\n415\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.510\nside, this has gone through many\ndifferent names in its lifetime and\n\n416\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust go with the one that I know.\n\n417\n00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.890\nThis is called the notification area.\n\n418\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:53.279\nYou might hear it sometimes going back to\nthe older days called the system tray,\n\n419\n00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:56.630\nall good, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n420\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.110\nBut it does give us notifications of\nsome interesting information right here.\n\n421\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.510\nIt shows me my current network status.\n\n422\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.560\nI can see that I have internet access and\n\n423\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.790\nthat I am connected to\nthe network right here.\n\n424\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.880\nThat's your little monitor icon with\nthe little trident, pitchfork, and again,\n\n425\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.450\nit let's you know whether or\nnot you have internet access.\n\n426\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.940\nAnd if I right-click on this,\nI see a little bit more of a dialogue box,\n\n427\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.150\njust a little bit more,\n\n428\n00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:26.500\nsay a little bit more prettier of\na right-click context box here.\n\n429\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.690\nBut I can also go into the Network and\nSharing Center, and\n\n430\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.090\nwe'll worry more about the network\ncoming up in our later episode here.\n\n431\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.500\nAt least know that you can launch\ninto your network settings, and\n\n432\n00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:43.890\nget a heads-up view of just your\nnetwork connectivity in general.\n\n433\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.169\nNow there's an arrow here, we'll talk\nabout some of these other ones here, but\n\n434\n00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:49.676\nthere's an arrow here, and\nwhat that's letting me know is,\n\n435\n00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:51.191\nit's letting me know hidden icons.\n\n436\n00:23:51.191 --> 00:23:55.460\nI have enough notifications here that what\nit's doing is that it's just collapsing\n\n437\n00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.126\nthem on themselves to save a little\nbit of real estate along the taskbar,\n\n438\n00:23:59.126 --> 00:24:00.770\nso it doesn't get bogged down.\n\n439\n00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.159\nAnd you can see, if I hit that Up arrow,\n\n440\n00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:07.080\nnotice that I also have the ability\nto look at additional icons.\n\n441\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.010\nI could customize this if I wanted,\nlet me back out here.\n\n442\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.890\nAnd I could, if I want,\n\n443\n00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.410\nI could pick, notice that Action Center is\nShow the icon and the notification area.\n\n444\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.970\nWe've got the Volume and\nthere's Bluetooth there.\n\n445\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.180\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that if I wanted to,\n\n446\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.580\njust by a simple right-click\nhere on that triangle,\n\n447\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.140\nI do get the ability to make\ncustomizations if I want.\n\n448\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.340\nNow each one of these, like I've showed\nyou with the network icon in general,\n\n449\n00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.690\nis configurable.\n\n450\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.037\nI can right-click on this and it's\nalso got a context options menu there,\n\n451\n00:24:40.037 --> 00:24:41.624\ncontextual options menu,\n\n452\n00:24:41.624 --> 00:24:45.590\nthat will allow you to do what\nit is that you might need to do.\n\n453\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.127\nA really fun one and a really important\none, I'll just hover over this one so\n\n454\n00:24:49.127 --> 00:24:51.850\nyou guys [LAUGH] know this if\nyou've never dealt with this.\n\n455\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.610\nIf you are using USB drives,\nyou've got something plugged in,\n\n456\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.630\nyou wanna make sure that you don't\ncorrupt the data that's on it.\n\n457\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.950\nYou can always right-click\non this like we've done and\n\n458\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.860\nyou can safely remove any of the items\nthat are plug and play here.\n\n459\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.665\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthose too much for now.\n\n460\n00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:12.406\nA couple other things that I would say,\nwith the notification\n\n461\n00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:16.090\narea you also have your time and\nyou could bring up your calendar here.\n\n462\n00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:20.190\nAnd then, again with these, now these\nlittle blue links, I kinda clicked on them\n\n463\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.550\nand I just assumed that you know what they\nare without actually explaining them.\n\n464\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.400\nThese are little hyperlinks,\nthey're task links, if you will.\n\n465\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.650\nAnd they work much the same way,\nif you've ever been in a web\n\n466\n00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.040\nbrowser where you've clicked a little blue\nlink and it opens up another web page.\n\n467\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.520\nWell, these are task links and they work\nkinda the same in the fact that if I click\n\n468\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.795\non this, it brings me up to\nan additional dialog box.\n\n469\n00:25:42.795 --> 00:25:47.690\nAnd Microsoft has just made it easier\nto use these hyperlinks as a launch\n\n470\n00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.280\npad to basically take you\ninto different locations.\n\n471\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.070\nNow, the other one I\nwant to mention here is,\n\n472\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.960\nthis is a gem that's in\nthe Windows 7 operating system.\n\n473\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.922\nI wanna kinda bring up a couple of\ndifferent applications here and\n\n474\n00:26:01.922 --> 00:26:04.740\njust kinda show you that last one there.\n\n475\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.460\nNotice that I have two windows open here.\n\n476\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.810\nAnd if I go back down there to\nthe lower right hand corner again,\n\n477\n00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.160\nwhere my head's at.\n\n478\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.400\nAnd if I hover over there,\nnotice that it says Show desktop.\n\n479\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.040\nAnd if I click this, notice that\nevery one of those applications or\n\n480\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.050\nwindows that I have open are gone.\n\n481\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.890\nWell, where did they go?\n\n482\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.120\nDid it close them down?\n\n483\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.430\nIt did something known as minimize.\n\n484\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.830\nAll right, minimize in is\nanother option that you have.\n\n485\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.270\nIf you decide that you wanna\nkeep an application open, but\n\n486\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:38.800\nyou don't want to have it on your desktop,\nyou can choose the Show desktop icon and\n\n487\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.370\nit minimizes all applications.\n\n488\n00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.630\nOr we can come up here and\nchoose this underscore option and\n\n489\n00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.860\nit does the same thing.\n\n490\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.280\nSo it's basically like saying, hey,\nI wanna minimize all of your applications.\n\n491\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.160\nOne of the last things I\nmight show you here, and\n\n492\n00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.488\nagain, a little bit more advanced,\nbut just so you know where it is.\n\n493\n00:26:57.488 --> 00:27:01.780\nIf I right-click on the taskbar, I've got\na set of Properties that I can configure.\n\n494\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.440\nNow, it's gonna be a lot like the same\ndialog box that you've seen before\n\n495\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.620\nwhen we were on the Start menu.\n\n496\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.190\nBut the difference is the tabs,\nokay, see these are tabs,\n\n497\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.540\nI also take a second to\nshow you what these are.\n\n498\n00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.560\nAnd you could switch between the different\ntabs offering different options.\n\n499\n00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.370\nThe Taskbar here, keep in mind,\n\n500\n00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:24.270\nin the Taskbar properties I do get the\noption to modify the taskbar a little bit.\n\n501\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:28.320\nIncluding things like Auto-hide which\nwould make the taskbar disappear.\n\n502\n00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.280\nI don't personally like that setting, but\n\n503\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.510\nyou can also modify different aspects\nof the taskbar if you want to.\n\n504\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.290\nNow, that being said too,\nmaybe one of the true last\n\n505\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.008\nthings I will say about the taskbar,\nnotice how it says it's locked?\n\n506\n00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:42.890\nWell, the taskbar is customizable as well.\n\n507\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.394\nIf I choose to choose that option,\nbasically,\n\n508\n00:27:45.394 --> 00:27:47.846\nyou'll see that the check\nmark is gone there.\n\n509\n00:27:47.846 --> 00:27:51.351\nAnd I do have the ability,\nif I want now, I can,\n\n510\n00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:55.170\nlet's see if it'll let me do it,\nthere we go.\n\n511\n00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.170\nI can move the taskbar to the different\nsides of the desktop if I want.\n\n512\n00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.940\nPersonally, I just keep it right there,\nand I do lock it.\n\n513\n00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.990\nAll right, Ronnie, so\nthat's a couple of things\n\n514\n00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.970\nthat we have as far as the basic\nentrance into the interface.\n\n515\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.860\nKeep in mind, hover,\nright, hover over things.\n\n516\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.270\nIf you're not exactly sure what it does,\nand\n\n517\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.610\nthere's an icon on your desktop,\nhover over it, find out what it says.\n\n518\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.879\nA lot of times you can get information\njust by taking that cursor,\n\n519\n00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:26.551\nand just hovering right over it.\n\n520\n00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:28.812\nAnd it'll give you the chance to\nsee a little bit of information,\n\n521\n00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:30.800\neven if you don't know what it does.\n\n522\n00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, I know that we're a little\nbit short on time but I think we have\n\n523\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.460\nenough time to cover the idea of just\ncustomization a little bit more.\n\n524\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.690\nAnd that is, I know that people can change\nit from that default background and\n\n525\n00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.350\nactually make the style look\na little bit different.\n\n526\n00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.690\nWes, can you show us how to do that?\n\n527\n00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, great question here.\n\n528\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.210\nLet's go back to our desktop and\nthis time remember that the right-click,\n\n529\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.360\nthe context,\nthe right-click on the desktop.\n\n530\n00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.020\nAnd you gotta be careful with that too so\nlet me show you here on my desktop.\n\n531\n00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.270\nNow here's what I wanna,\njust real quick, I wanna show you here.\n\n532\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.230\nNotice that when I right-click here,\nnotice there's a set of options.\n\n533\n00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.930\nWe'll get to those,\nexactly what Ronnie was asking.\n\n534\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.240\nBut the moment I come down here,\n\n535\n00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.110\nI get a completely different\nset of right-click options.\n\n536\n00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.960\nSo what I'm gonna tell you now\nis to do what Ronnie's saying.\n\n537\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.320\nMake sure you're on the desktop, you\nclick the desktop when you right-click.\n\n538\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.940\nAnd you're gonna notice something,\nan option that says, Personalize, right?\n\n539\n00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.928\nWell, we're gonna look in how\nwe can change that background.\n\n540\n00:29:27.928 --> 00:29:31.088\nWe'll select Personalize, all right.\n\n541\n00:29:31.088 --> 00:29:33.310\nAnd then the option that we have here,\nif we want,\n\n542\n00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.220\nis to change what\nbackground we might want.\n\n543\n00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.306\nAll right, and if I decide I can\nchange the desktop background.\n\n544\n00:29:41.306 --> 00:29:44.740\nAnd looks like I'm getting out of\nthe area there where you can see that.\n\n545\n00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.390\nNotice, it says Desktop Background?\n\n546\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.670\nI've got the option,\nI can click that, all right?\n\n547\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.575\nAnd we'll scroll back out here and\nI've got the chance that I can pick,\n\n548\n00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:58.045\nin this case, I can select this\nnext picture that's in the list.\n\n549\n00:29:58.045 --> 00:30:01.655\nYou can download one of you want and\nyou can use your own pictures.\n\n550\n00:30:01.655 --> 00:30:03.785\nIf you like your favorite\ncomic book character,\n\n551\n00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:05.345\nyou put your comic book character there.\n\n552\n00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:07.825\nIn this case,\nI'm just gonna use the defaults.\n\n553\n00:30:07.825 --> 00:30:11.355\nAnd then we have the option to change\nhow the picture is positioned.\n\n554\n00:30:11.355 --> 00:30:14.325\nIf we wanna tile it, personally\nthat's a little distracting for me so\n\n555\n00:30:14.325 --> 00:30:17.140\nI just let it fill\nthe whole entire screen.\n\n556\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.010\nAnd notice that I can save the changes.\n\n557\n00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.940\nAnd when I close this down, I now have\nbeautiful picture of a sunset or maybe\n\n558\n00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.880\na sunrise, and I don't know, some lavender\nand a lake, makes me wanna go fishing.\n\n559\n00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.050\nSo you can [LAUGH] change\nyour background as well.\n\n560\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.300\nRemember that you don't have to\nstick with the defaults either.\n\n561\n00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.220\nYou can load up your own pictures and\nload them into that area and\n\n562\n00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.850\nyou can customize it even more.\n\n563\n00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Wes, for showing\nus at least some of those basics there.\n\n564\n00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.000\nAnd a lot of times in a work environment,\nin a corporate environment,\n\n565\n00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.128\nas you go to work on\ncomputers on a daily basis,\n\n566\n00:30:49.128 --> 00:30:51.764\nit is possible that you can\nchange some of these options.\n\n567\n00:30:51.764 --> 00:30:56.465\nIncluding the size of the mouse itself and\nthere's a few other things, but\n\n568\n00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:59.533\nto customize it,\nto make it fit what you need to.\n\n569\n00:30:59.533 --> 00:31:04.167\nBut you might also end up finding out\nthat you can't change any of it either\n\n570\n00:31:04.167 --> 00:31:06.960\nbecause that environment may lock it down.\n\n571\n00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.730\nHopefully it won't be, but if that\nenvironment locks it down to the point\n\n572\n00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:15.030\nwhere when you right-click on something\nand you don't have that option available,\n\n573\n00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.170\nor the option looks like it's\ngrayed out and you can't select it.\n\n574\n00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.810\nIt could be that it is being\ncontrolled somewhere else.\n\n575\n00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.066\nSo even though you might have it,\nyou may not as well.\n\n576\n00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:26.276\nJust kinda realize that those are our\noptions that you'll be facing.\n\n577\n00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:29.942\nNow, Wes has showed us a lot of great\nthings and helping us to at least get used\n\n578\n00:31:29.942 --> 00:31:33.420\nto the interface that we'll be\nseeing on day-to-day basis.\n\n579\n00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.930\nBut there's actually even more that\nwe're actually going to talk about.\n\n580\n00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.405\nBut we're gonna come back for\nthat in a part two.\n\n581\n00:31:39.405 --> 00:31:42.600\nSo that you get a full benefit of\nunderstanding things like user\n\n582\n00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.550\naccounts and a few other settings there\n\n583\n00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.381\nthat will really help you\nas a computer user as well.\n\n584\n00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:51.540\nWell, it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n585\n00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.047\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n586\n00:31:55.047 --> 00:31:56.183\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n587\n00:31:56.183 --> 00:32:00.808\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned for\nmore IC3 Computing

00:00:19.850\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and you're\nwatching the IC3 Computing Fundamentals\n\n4\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.340\nshow where we are about to go into\nthe part two of configurations and\n\n5\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.500\nsome of the different types of\npreferences that we have available.\n\n6\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.230\nWe've already taken a look at\nsome of the customizations.\n\n7\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.030\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthat a little bit more.\n\n8\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.310\nBut then there are some other features\nthat you need to know about as you\n\n9\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.340\nuse the computer.\n\n10\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.840\nAnd who better to help us than, well, Mr.\nWindows himself, Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.990\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n12\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.020\n>> Thanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.227\nThat's right.\nI talked way too much on the first one, so\n\n14\n00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:46.808\nwe're coming back with a part two.\n\n15\n00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:47.359\nThat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.697\nThere are a couple of things that we wanna\nlook at that we didn't touch base on in\n\n17\n00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:53.492\nthe first part of this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:55.950\nFirst part of the segment,\nI guess I should say.\n\n19\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.660\nAnd we looked at the desktop, right.\n\n20\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.590\nWe looked at the task bar,\nsome of the configurations but\n\n21\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.770\nthere are other configurations that\nyou might have to take into account\n\n22\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.720\nwhen you are supporting a computer, or\nmaybe you're not supporting a computer,\n\n23\n00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.820\nmaybe you're just using the computer.\n\n24\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.340\nYou might want to understand\nsome of these next topics.\n\n25\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.900\nAnd one of the first ones I want to\ntalk about are user accounts, and\n\n26\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.710\nyou might say well a user account, that's\njust a person that logs into the machine.\n\n27\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.400\nAnd you would be right, that is true,\nbut the type of user account you\n\n28\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.950\nhave is going to drastically\nchange the computing experience,\n\n29\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.260\nwhat you can and\ncannot do within the machine.\n\n30\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.020\nSo one of the very first types\nof user accounts that we\n\n31\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.440\nwanna talk about is something\nknown as the administrator.\n\n32\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.110\nOr the administrative account.\n\n33\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840\nNow the administrator accounts.\n\n34\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.950\nThese are the accounts that allow\nyou to pretty much have your\n\n35\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.180\nrun of the operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.540\nYou can do things like\ninstalling software.\n\n37\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.020\nYou can run most of your utilities.\n\n38\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.970\nIn fact some of the utilities that you\nhave inside of Windows that keeps that\n\n39\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.090\nenvironment running to its tip-top shape,\nrequiring you to\n\n40\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530\nbe this type of user before you can\neven see or launch those utilities.\n\n41\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.830\nSo it is important to understand\nthat the administrator\n\n42\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.290\nis not only a powerful account,\nbut it does present, potentially,\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.910\nsecurity concerns, because of the fact,\nand what I mean by security is\n\n44\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.620\ndon't think that I'm talking about the CIA\ncoming in a grabbing your computer.\n\n45\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.400\nI don't mean those kind\nof security concerns.\n\n46\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.010\nI mean the stability of the operating\nsystem because you can make configuration\n\n47\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.400\nchanges that could change the core\nfunctionality of the operating system or\n\n48\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.250\nkey system settings.\n\n49\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.315\nYou also have the potential to\nmisconfigure some settings and\n\n50\n00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:36.830\nyou could cause some problems too.\n\n51\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.610\nSo that's why if you're an administrator\nyou wanna protect that account, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.460\nNow if we are talking true security you\ngonna wanna protect that account just\n\n53\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.408\nbecause of the privileges that it has.\n\n54\n00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:52.510\nIt's what we'd call a privileged account\nhas more privileges then the other types\n\n55\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.440\nof accounts that we're gonna talk about\nwhich is what's known as a standard user.\n\n56\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.120\nNow the standard user, they can perform\nmost of their day to day tasks.\n\n57\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.070\nThey can launch most of the applications\nthat, line of business type applications,\n\n58\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.980\na lot of the software that's on\nthe machine, things like Notepad and\n\n59\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.280\nPaint and Calculator that\nwe've already kinda looked at.\n\n60\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.330\nSo far they can launch those applications.\n\n61\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.100\nHowever, but\n\n62\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.270\nwhen they go to launch an application\nthat requires the other context.\n\n63\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.169\nRight.\nThe administrator.\n\n64\n00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.470\nSomethings going to change.\n\n65\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.140\nAll right?\n\n66\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.210\nNow, what does that change gonna be?\n\n67\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.320\nThat's a little technology that's\nbeen inside of the windows,\n\n68\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.080\na little dialogue box that pops up and\nit could potentially blocks somebody\n\n69\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.320\nfrom launching certain applications,\ncertainly installing applications and\n\n70\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.030\nmaking key security settings\nchanges if you will.\n\n71\n00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.340\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n72\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.710\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n73\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.440\nWhen we talk about the user account,\n\n74\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.850\nremember that I told you there\nare two different types of users and\n\n75\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.600\nagain they have different things\nthat they can do on the computer.\n\n76\n00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.240\nNow any time somebody logs in they get\nwhat's known as this little electronic\n\n77\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.200\npiece of information called a token.\n\n78\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.650\nAnd just understand that\nthat tells the computer,\n\n79\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.360\nthe system,\nthe context of who you're logging into.\n\n80\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.090\nWhat I mean is are you logging\nin as a standard user?\n\n81\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.400\nOr are you logging in as an administrator?\n\n82\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.870\nNow, if you are a standard user and\nyou log in, you get the standard users,\n\n83\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.270\nlet's just call it a standard user badge,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.110\nAnd it let's you know that you\nhave restricted privileges.\n\n85\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.920\nWhen you decide that you are going to\nlaunch an application, a utility, or\n\n86\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.280\na setting,\nthat requires that administrative badge.\n\n87\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.320\nWell, that's where the user\naccount control comes in to play.\n\n88\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.990\nYou might see these little user account\ncontrol icons, these little four colored,\n\n89\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.560\nalmost looks like the UNO colors,\nthere, in a shield.\n\n90\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.670\nThat's letting you know,\nany time you see that icon,\n\n91\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.730\nthat you have to be an administrator\nto perform whatever functionality\n\n92\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.610\nthat it is that application performs.\n\n93\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.890\nWhat it's doing here is it's\nactually protecting your account.\n\n94\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.200\nIt's saying, I'm not gonna let you do\nthose things unless you can prove to me\n\n95\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.660\nthat you're an administrator.\n\n96\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.080\nNow, what if you already\nare an administrator?\n\n97\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.040\nWell this is kind of interesting,\nto protect the operating system,\n\n98\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340\nyou're also running as a standard user.\n\n99\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.300\nBut the cool thing is, you have two badges\nyou don't just have one badge that says\n\n100\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.910\nhey I'm a standard user or in this\ncase you're an administrator, you have\n\n101\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.700\na standard user badge and you also have\nan administrator badge, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.730\nAnd this is kinda like showing your,\nmaybe you've got a security card,\n\n103\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.625\nthe security clearance and\nyou say well here's what it says I am,\n\n104\n00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:38.050\nI am West Bryan here but\nmy security card gets me through the door.\n\n105\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.260\nWell, what happens is your operating\nsystem looks at that administrator badge,\n\n106\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.190\nin this case a token.\n\n107\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.330\nAnd says okay, we could see\nthat you are the administrator.\n\n108\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.230\nSo what you have to do when this\nlittle dialogue that's gonna pop up\n\n109\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.110\nis you have to press, yes to continue\nthe operation or no to cancel it.\n\n110\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.900\nAll right, if you're a standard user,\nand that's all you are, right,\n\n111\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.320\nyou're not wearing both badges,\nlike administrator.\n\n112\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.770\nYou're a standard user, you don't get\nthe yes to continue the operation,\n\n113\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.540\nyou still get the no for sure.\n\n114\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.940\nBut what you get is a username and\npassword dialog box, and what it's saying\n\n115\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.220\nis, prove to me that you know\nan administrator's username and password.\n\n116\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.560\nSo that I can give you the ability,\nthe privilege to perform this function.\n\n117\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.820\nAnd if you don't have that, well it's\ngonna shut that operation down and\n\n118\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.210\nit's a way that the Windows operating\nsystem tries to protect itself\n\n119\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.530\nagainst things like attacks if\nyou get viruses on your computer.\n\n120\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.540\nRight?\nWe don't want just things running\n\n121\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.600\nin the context if you will\nwith all those privileges and\n\n122\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.220\nwe don't know anything about it.\n\n123\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.370\nNo, what this does is it's\na security platform that says\n\n124\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.420\nthe moment something like that happens,\nwe're gonna make you aware of it and\n\n125\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.050\nyou're gonna have to interact with it.\n\n126\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.790\nNow that being said let's show you\n\n127\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.440\na little bit about where you can\nconfigure those user accounts.\n\n128\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.000\nSo over here on my Windows 10 machine\nall right let me go ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.610\nI think I'm gonna change that\nbackground a little bit Ronnie.\n\n130\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.145\nThat's really.\n>> It looks like a Windows 7 machine.\n\n131\n00:07:04.145 --> 00:07:07.005\n>> Our Windows 7 machine we better\nmake sure that we're on the right\n\n132\n00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:07.793\nmachine as well.\n\n133\n00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:11.923\nSo it's changing here I like more of\na plain background let's hope it actually\n\n134\n00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:12.496\nchanges.\n\n135\n00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:16.206\nIt takes a second there and it's saying\nIt's letting me know that it's changing it\n\n136\n00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:18.160\nback to the original desktop here.\n\n137\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.288\nNow when you create these accounts\nyou have to kind of understand before\n\n138\n00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:28.002\nyou create them what level of\nprivilege you wanna give somebody.\n\n139\n00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:29.110\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n140\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.190\nWe're gonna go back to our start menu and\nthere's an area that I'm looking for\n\n141\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.050\nand we haven't really\ntalked about this yet.\n\n142\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.840\nIt's called the control panel.\n\n143\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.570\nNow we're gonna launch the control panel\nand I'm just gonna kinda show you just\n\n144\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.630\na little bit about what we've\ngot going on here, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.128\nThe control panel is the interface\nthat allows you to configure a lot of\n\n146\n00:07:47.128 --> 00:07:48.800\nthe settings inside of Windows.\n\n147\n00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.496\nSome of the settings you will configure,\nsome of the settings you might\n\n148\n00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:55.278\nnot ever look at at all in\nyour computing experience.\n\n149\n00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:59.568\nBut the ones that I'm really\nconcerned about In the context of\n\n150\n00:07:59.568 --> 00:08:01.228\nUser Accounts as well.\n\n151\n00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:01.757\nLook at this.\n\n152\n00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:04.390\nIt's a User Accounts and Family Safety.\n\n153\n00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.410\nAnd what they have done, is they've\ngrouped these together by category so\n\n154\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.600\nyou can kinda get an idea of\nwhere they're gonna take you.\n\n155\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.250\nRemember I told you there are task links,\n\n156\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.010\nnotice how it kinda looks maybe like a\nlittle clickable link that if you've ever\n\n157\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.330\nbrowsed out on the internet on a web page.\n\n158\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.940\nWell if I click this,\ntakes me to a different location.\n\n159\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.240\nNow this gives me a series of\noptions that are directly related to\n\n160\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.220\na category known as User Accounts.\n\n161\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.580\nAll right, but what I want specifically,\nremember more of that hover to discover?\n\n162\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.360\nLet me show you how\nawesome that really is.\n\n163\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.310\nI really like this.\n\n164\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.060\nSo it says User Accounts and\nif I hover over it, notice what it says.\n\n165\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.980\nChange user account settings and passwords\nfor people who share this computer.\n\n166\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.940\nChances are, that's where we wanna be if\nwe're gonna be modifying user accounts, so\n\n167\n00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.902\nwe'll go ahead and click that.\n\n168\n00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:54.765\nAll right,\nlet me back out here a little bit.\n\n169\n00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:57.855\nTry not to make you guys sea sick\nout there, and we'll go ahead and\n\n170\n00:08:57.855 --> 00:08:59.385\nlook here, all right?\n\n171\n00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:02.375\nNotice it makes changes to\nyour user account, right?\n\n172\n00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:06.845\nI can modify my own,\naspects of my own account.\n\n173\n00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.825\nNotice that I can change my account type.\n\n174\n00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:11.645\nNow, I'm not gonna do that yet, but I will\nshow you that setting here when it comes\n\n175\n00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:14.610\nto managing your users on these machines.\n\n176\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.690\nNotice it says Manage another account.\n\n177\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.620\nThat's where we wanna be right here,\nmanaging other accounts.\n\n178\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.100\nWe'll go ahead and\nclick this task link, and\n\n179\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.934\nwe'll give it a second\nhere to open that up.\n\n180\n00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.535\nAll right, wait for it.\n\n181\n00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:34.785\nI tell you, as fast as computers are,\nthe faster they get,\n\n182\n00:09:34.785 --> 00:09:37.555\nthe more impatient I get,\nI can tell you that.\n\n183\n00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:39.465\nAnd now notice here at the bottom.\n\n184\n00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:43.675\nIf you don't know what a user account is,\nyou got a hyperlink right here that's\n\n185\n00:09:43.675 --> 00:09:45.705\ngonna tell you,\nhey this is what a user account is.\n\n186\n00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:48.685\nAnd then you can click on that, and\nit's gonna bring up the help menu.\n\n187\n00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:52.280\nAnd the help menu has a lot of\ndocumentation in here that can help you\n\n188\n00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.760\nwith the basics of getting\ninformation about the user account.\n\n189\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.990\nNotice it says here,\nwhat is a user account?\n\n190\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.750\nA collection of information\nthat tells Windows which files,\n\n191\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.790\nwhich folders you can access.\n\n192\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.630\nRemember what I talked about,\nchanging information?\n\n193\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.385\nWhat changes you can make to the computer.\n\n194\n00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:15.800\nSo that's important to understand\nwhat the user account is doing here.\n\n195\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.700\nNot only just using the computer,\nbut also configuring it.\n\n196\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.760\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n197\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.200\nLet's create and account real quick.\n\n198\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.270\nAnd we'll choose Create a new account.\n\n199\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.170\nThe first thing that we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna figure out what we're gonna\n\n200\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.670\nname the user account, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.415\nNow you can name it after the end user,\nyou can name it first and last name.\n\n202\n00:10:35.415 --> 00:10:37.365\nKeep it simplistic though.\n\n203\n00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:40.828\nYou certainly don't want to\nname it Wes is the Greatest or\n\n204\n00:10:40.828 --> 00:10:44.990\nsomething like that because it gets\na little bit harder to type in.\n\n205\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.310\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm just gonna say, you know what?\n\n206\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.170\nWe'll just call this USER, and\nI think I have to do USER02\n\n207\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.030\nbecause I've already got a USER01\nas I'm practicing and stuff.\n\n208\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.220\nAnd I like to stay familiar here too.\n\n209\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.865\nSo we're gonna call this USER02.\n\n210\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.550\nApparently I had the caps lock on there.\n\n211\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.790\nNothing like yelling at your own computer.\n\n212\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.560\nAll right, and then the next thing that\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n213\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.760\nnotice the accounts here.\n\n214\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.560\nI want you to take a second here and\n\n215\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.480\nlook at the different types\nof accounts that we have.\n\n216\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.400\nStandard user, most software they can use,\nbut system settings that\n\n217\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.340\ndon't affect other users, just themselves,\nlike customizing the desktop like we've\n\n218\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.960\nseen in the first part of this episode\nwhere Ronnie had me change the background.\n\n219\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.160\nThat only affects me so I can change\nthat if we're a standard user.\n\n220\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.355\nIf Ronnie's a standard user,\nhe can change his background.\n\n221\n00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:37.015\nIt only affects him.\n\n222\n00:11:37.015 --> 00:11:40.795\nBut we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna say that this is a standard user,\n\n223\n00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:41.615\nwe'll call it User01,\n\n224\n00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:45.575\nI'm gonna leave it a standard user\nbecause I'm an administrator.\n\n225\n00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:48.160\nWe can show you the difference\nbetween the two.\n\n226\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.040\nAll right, and we'll choose create an\naccount and we'll let it do exactly that.\n\n227\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.232\nIt'll create the account, and the next\nthing that we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n228\n00:11:58.232 --> 00:12:01.023\nlook a little bit at that user account\ncontrol that I was talking about.\n\n229\n00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:05.728\nSometimes it is just, and you know what?\n\n230\n00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:07.740\nIt looks like I did name it there.\n\n231\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.850\nI tried to name it twice.\n\n232\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.380\nIt's probably already there.\n\n233\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.800\nIf we give it just a second here.\n\n234\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.550\nAnd there it is, User02.\n\n235\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.730\nI clicked twice and it was saying wait\na second, the first click was enough.\n\n236\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.670\nYou click twice and\nit's trying to create it a second time.\n\n237\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.270\nNow I can see the standard user and I\ncould login as this person if I wanted to.\n\n238\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.230\nI can also click their icon here and if I\nwanted, I could manage their account from\n\n239\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:35.790\nhere if that's something that is in maybe\nmy job function or just your interaction.\n\n240\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.960\nMaybe you've even got kids out there.\n\n241\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.970\nMaybe you need to create them an account,\nand I could change the account name,\n\n242\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.590\nI could create a password and\npassword protect it here.\n\n243\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.960\nSo you can see some of the various\noptions that you could do, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.820\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a password here real quick.\n\n245\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.620\nThat is always important to have\na password here, all right?\n\n246\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.450\nAnd I'm gonna just put here, guys,\nhonestly a really generic password.\n\n247\n00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.520\nNot probably one that you\nshould really wanna use.\n\n248\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.440\nBut let me go ahead and\nwe'll put up a password hint.\n\n249\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.730\nAnd we'll say I'll call it weak [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.450\nIt is a weak password.\n\n251\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.075\nAnd we'll choose Create.\n\n252\n00:13:14.075 --> 00:13:16.119\nAnd we'll let that go ahead and\ncreate, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:21.404\nNow, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna log out as myself,\n\n254\n00:13:21.404 --> 00:13:24.223\nthat's the administrator.\n\n255\n00:13:27.992 --> 00:13:35.450\nAll right, and I tell you what, to make\nit a little bit easier, There we go.\n\n256\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.800\nWe'll let it go ahead and log out.\n\n257\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.240\nHopefully I didn't restart the machine.\n\n258\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.360\nIf not we're gonna be waiting for\na reboot, right?\n\n259\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.040\nReboots fix everything.\n\n260\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.100\nAnd let me go ahead and\njust cancel this real quick.\n\n261\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.010\nSee if I can cancel it\nbefore it actually does.\n\n262\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.970\nSometimes you can cancel it,\nsometimes you can't.\n\n263\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.732\nThere it is,\nit's actually logging off here.\n\n264\n00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:53.220\nAll right, so we have logged off the user.\n\n265\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.540\nI can see icons here.\n\n266\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.360\nWell what do these icons mean for me?\n\n267\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.580\nWell these are the user accounts\nthat are available on the machine.\n\n268\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.000\nAll right, if you don't see an icon here,\n\n269\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.240\nit isn't a user that's\ncreated on this machine.\n\n270\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.090\nSo we're gonna go ahead and log in as\nUser02, we got a nice little robot there.\n\n271\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.930\nAnd we're gonna see what a standard\nuser can do, all right, and\n\n272\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.390\nI'll show you the context of the UAC.\n\n273\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.420\nUser account control, and\nthen we'll look back along and\n\n274\n00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.070\nwe'll see the difference of\nwhat the administrator does.\n\n275\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.638\nNow when you first log in to a machine,\n\n276\n00:14:22.638 --> 00:14:24.941\nyou might see that it takes\na little bit of time, right?\n\n277\n00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:28.497\nRemember we talked about like for\ninstance, the user name in the Start\n\n278\n00:14:28.497 --> 00:14:32.669\nmenu and it says where your personal files\nare stored, where you can access them?\n\n279\n00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:33.877\nWell that's what it's doing.\n\n280\n00:14:33.877 --> 00:14:36.589\nIt's saying, okay,\nnow we gotta new user here,\n\n281\n00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:40.013\nlet's set a little portion of\nthis operating system aside just\n\n282\n00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:43.710\nspecifically for that user,\nsomething known as the user profile.\n\n283\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.340\nSo it's building that up and I'll have all\nthose places that are unique to this user\n\n284\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.950\nwhere they can store their information.\n\n285\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.411\nThat being said, what we're gonna do in\nthe first thing is we're gonna launch\n\n286\n00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:59.537\na regular application versus\nan administrative application just to see\n\n287\n00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:04.021\nwhat the, what an end user would see when\nit comes to the user account control.\n\n288\n00:15:04.021 --> 00:15:07.981\nSo we'll give it a second here,\nhopefully it doesn't take too long there.\n\n289\n00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:12.618\nIt's chugging along and\nit is preparing, and like I said,\n\n290\n00:15:12.618 --> 00:15:17.942\nthe more the faster these computers get,\nthe more impatient I get.\n\n291\n00:15:17.942 --> 00:15:21.900\n>> So Wes, let's go ahead and review some\nof these concepts that you just talk even\n\n292\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.630\nthough I just logged in here to\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n293\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.890\nRemember that when you first log in,\nwhen you're going to work,\n\n294\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.680\nit's probably going to require you\nto have a username and a password.\n\n295\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.660\nAnd it doesn't mean that you've actually\ngot everything set up on the computer.\n\n296\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.060\nFirst time you log in it's gonna\ntake a little bit of time, and\n\n297\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.394\nwhat it's doing in the background is\nbuilding your particular containers\n\n298\n00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:46.660\nthat only your information\ngoing to go into.\n\n299\n00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.561\nAnd the reason behind that is because\nthere could be multiple user using\n\n300\n00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:51.936\nthe very same computer.\n\n301\n00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:56.820\nLet say you work 24 hours a day shop,\nand even you there for eight hours a day\n\n302\n00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.420\nthe next shift comes on, and\nsomebody also uses that computer as well.\n\n303\n00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.383\nWell they're gonna log on.\n\n304\n00:16:02.383 --> 00:16:07.057\nInstead of your files co-mingling with\ntheirs, they're gonna actually get\n\n305\n00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:11.020\nseparate file structures that\nwill look exactly the same.\n\n306\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.834\nSo think about a filing cabinet for\nyou and a filing cabinet for\n\n307\n00:16:14.834 --> 00:16:20.025\nwhoever that other user's going to be,\nwhoever that user's gonna be.\n\n308\n00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:23.470\nWell, when you access it,\nyou're only accessing your files and\n\n309\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.140\nthen when they're accessing it, they're\nonly accessing their files as well.\n\n310\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.230\nLet's also mention this idea of the UAC,\nthe user account control and\n\n311\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.000\nthe administrative as well as\nthe standard user account too.\n\n312\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.410\nMost of the time when that\naccount is created by default,\n\n313\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.470\nyou will be a standard user.\n\n314\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.670\nAnd that is for the protection\nof the computer system itself.\n\n315\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:49.110\nAnd what does that actually really\nonly prevent you from doing?\n\n316\n00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.600\nWell, if you accidentally download\nsomething from the Internet and you go,\n\n317\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.040\nI wonder if this will run on my computer.\n\n318\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.529\nBeing that standard\nuser will prevent that.\n\n319\n00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:01.188\nAnd what it will do is when you go and\ntry and run that,\n\n320\n00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:04.180\nit's gonna say,\nyou're not allowed to do that.\n\n321\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.250\nPlease enter in as somebody that\nhas an administrative credentials\n\n322\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.060\nto be able to run this program.\n\n323\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.700\nAnd that means you don't have it,\nyou won't be able to run it unless you can\n\n324\n00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.650\ntalk somebody into allowing\nyou to run this program.\n\n325\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.130\nWhen you go and ask them they're gonna\nsay where did you get this program from,\n\n326\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.891\nit's gonna be the Internet.\n\n327\n00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:21.017\nThey're gonna say no,\nwe're not gnna run that program.\n\n328\n00:17:21.017 --> 00:17:24.827\nAnd it will stop you from accidentally\ndoing something to your computer that\n\n329\n00:17:24.827 --> 00:17:26.410\ncould cause harm.\n\n330\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.720\nSo that is kind of the key that\nwe're actually going to see and\n\n331\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.500\nWes is about to display that to us.\n\n332\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.392\n>> All right Ronnie,\nlet's do that very thing here.\n\n333\n00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:36.350\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna drop back down to our desktop.\n\n334\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.590\nAnd we'll see what happens to\nthe user account control as this user\n\n335\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.920\nthat we're logged in, it's just a standard\nuser, it doesn't have those privileges.\n\n336\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.190\nSo I'm gonna go to the Start button here.\n\n337\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.092\nWe're gonna go to the Control Panel.\n\n338\n00:17:47.092 --> 00:17:49.480\nWe go back to that same location,\nUser Accounts and\n\n339\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.850\nFamily Safety > User Accounts again.\n\n340\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.080\nAnd notice that we have several options\nhere that have the shield on them.\n\n341\n00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.370\nNotice there's\nChange User Account Control settings.\n\n342\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.300\nMaybe I don't like the fact that\nRonnie's made me a standard user and\n\n343\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.670\nI want to be able to install what I want,\nright?\n\n344\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.100\nWell, let's see if we can change that.\n\n345\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.760\nI'll go ahead and I'll click that,\nand notice what we get,\n\n346\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.160\nnotice the option that we get.\n\n347\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.820\nIt's telling me,\ntype an administrator password.\n\n348\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:19.107\nRemember the account that I was logged\nin as was an administrative account.\n\n349\n00:18:19.107 --> 00:18:22.872\nSo what it's saying is, no,\nyou don't have these privileges but\n\n350\n00:18:22.872 --> 00:18:26.920\nyou need to type in a password of\na user that does have those privileges.\n\n351\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.940\nSo that's the User Account Control.\n\n352\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.970\nAnd it is, just like Ronnie's saying,\nit's protecting your computer from\n\n353\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.670\nrunning things you otherwise wouldn't\neven know are on your computer.\n\n354\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.260\nSo let me go ahead,\nI'll do a switch user this time,\n\n355\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.990\nmake it a little bit faster, and\nI'll log back in as our Administrator.\n\n356\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.470\nAnd we'll see if there's a difference\nin the user experience that\n\n357\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.680\nan administrator has versus the standard\nuser when they got locked out there\n\n358\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.350\nby that User Account Control.\n\n359\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:57.050\nWe're going to the same place again guys,\nno different, Start > Control Panel.\n\n360\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.490\nOnce Control Panel launches,\nupper right hand corner,\n\n361\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.512\nwe're going to User Accounts and\nFamily Safety > User Accounts.\n\n362\n00:19:04.512 --> 00:19:08.533\nAnd then we're gonna change\nUser Account Control settings.\n\n363\n00:19:08.533 --> 00:19:11.320\nNow, as an administrator,\nwhen I decide that hey,\n\n364\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.490\nI wanna change these settings,\nI get the User Account dialog box, right?\n\n365\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.390\nNotice that it didn't warn me,\nright, didn't do anything.\n\n366\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.080\nNow I will tell you that if you\ninstall software as an administrator,\n\n367\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.170\nyou will trigger the User Account Control.\n\n368\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.810\nBut you notice that how we did that before\nas a standard user it gave the yes and no?\n\n369\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.274\nThe difference would be is that\nthe password dialog box is not there.\n\n370\n00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:37.130\nIt isn't there and\nwe could just click Yes.\n\n371\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.980\nAll right, so we've got a couple of,\n\n372\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.440\nthat's the difference\nbetween the user accounts.\n\n373\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.290\nCouple other things that you might\nhave to set up occasionally,\n\n374\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.910\nyou might have to adjust the date and\ntime.\n\n375\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.050\nNow I know my head's kinda\ncovering up this over here but\n\n376\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.740\nwe kinda showed you that task link\nearlier but we really didn't click on it.\n\n377\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.510\nIf I want to I can click this right there,\njust click right on the date and\n\n378\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:04.058\ntime there and I can choose change\ndate and time setting hyperlink.\n\n379\n00:20:04.058 --> 00:20:07.556\nAnd if we come up here towards the top,\nwe could see that we have the ability,\n\n380\n00:20:07.556 --> 00:20:10.550\nif we want,\nnow notice something that's interesting.\n\n381\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.970\nStandard users can't do this,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n382\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.420\nI could change the time\nzone if I wanted to.\n\n383\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.780\nI could change the date and time as well.\n\n384\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.910\nNow we also have the ability,\nif we need to,\n\n385\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.880\nto change things like the keyboard layout.\n\n386\n00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.000\nAnd the keyboard layout for me is the US,\nif you will, keyboard layout.\n\n387\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.700\nBut if I go back to the Start menu and\nI go to Control Panel,\n\n388\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.870\nthere's a lot of things that\nyou can do in Control Panel.\n\n389\n00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.420\nWe're gonna go to Clock,\nLanguage, and Region.\n\n390\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.042\nAll right, and notice Date and\nTime settings I can do here.\n\n391\n00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.190\nSo there's a lot of different\nplaces that you can do those.\n\n392\n00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.520\nRegion and Language,\nI have the ability to set Formats,\n\n393\n00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.850\nLocation, I could set the keyboard\narrangement if I want.\n\n394\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.610\nSo it is another good way to customize it.\n\n395\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.220\nI would say, Ronnie,\nthe final thing I'll show you is how\n\n396\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.775\nto do a little bit of personalization of\nthe theme that you have in Windows 7.\n\n397\n00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:04.670\nIt's a collection of visual settings here.\n\n398\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.770\nNice way to change this is just\nto right-click on the desktop,\n\n399\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.130\nchoose Personalize.\n\n400\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.790\nAnd you'll see that you the ability,\nif you want, to change the themes.\n\n401\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:20.620\nIf I change the theme it's gonna\nchange a lot of the banners,\n\n402\n00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.560\nif you will, around the different\ninterfaces if we want.\n\n403\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.210\nWe can also change the desktop icons and I\ncan also change the mouse pointer as well.\n\n404\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.020\nYou notice I just got this basic mouse,\nor cursor here.\n\n405\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.440\nIf I decided to, we could change\nthe cursor, we can change the button.\n\n406\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.250\nSo a little bit more\ncustomization that you can do,\n\n407\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.100\nsome of the pointer options if you want to\nincrease the speed or slow the speed down.\n\n408\n00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.300\nSo you do have the ability to fully\ncustomize the user experience,\n\n409\n00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.801\nthe user environment.\n\n410\n00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:53.264\nAnd also pay attention to the types\nof user accounts that you might be\n\n411\n00:21:53.264 --> 00:21:54.292\nlogging into.\n\n412\n00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:58.612\nCuz it could restrict your ability\nto do certain functions inside of\n\n413\n00:21:58.612 --> 00:22:00.136\nthe operating system.\n\n414\n00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:03.478\n>> There's no doubt that the majority\nof the features that we've seen here\n\n415\n00:22:03.478 --> 00:22:04.847\nare really gonna be helpful,\n\n416\n00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:08.170\nespecially if you're working\ninside of a business setting.\n\n417\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:12.020\nThere are some personalized home settings\nthat are also available out there\n\n418\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.650\nfor us too.\n\n419\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.320\nWhat they call the parental\nsafety types of settings as well,\n\n420\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.120\nthat allow you to control other\naccounts that you create.\n\n421\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.980\nAnd you can limit them by\nseveral different things.\n\n422\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.680\nOne, of course, is a time limit.\n\n423\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.850\nYou have a child on your machine,\nyou can also say look,\n\n424\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.870\nI don't want them spending all day.\n\n425\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.040\nYou can limit the amount of time that\nthey can gain access through that\n\n426\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.888\nWindows 7 machine.\n\n427\n00:22:32.888 --> 00:22:35.720\nIf they are playing video games,\n\n428\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.900\nyou also have the ability through\na voluntarily rating system to say,\n\n429\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.200\nI don't want these ratings or\nabove to be allowed there as well.\n\n430\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.493\nAnd then of course, they actually\ndo have a little bit more filtering\n\n431\n00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:52.946\nthat you can do by content that is\nalso available to you right there too.\n\n432\n00:22:52.946 --> 00:22:56.726\nAnd all that is just to help you\nout in the home setting as well.\n\n433\n00:22:56.726 --> 00:23:00.030\nSo we wanna mention those but\na lot of times those configurations don't\n\n434\n00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.080\nnecessarily need to go\nthrough all of them.\n\n435\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.240\nBecause, well, those are there for\nyou to try to explore and take a look at.\n\n436\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.020\nBut just realize that they are there for\nyou, no need to buy a third party set,\n\n437\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.740\nat least that's what Microsoft would say,\nunless you really want to.\n\n438\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.310\nBut just kinda realize that there's a lot\nof customization, a lot of configuration\n\n439\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:23.190\nfor an end user who is just getting used\nto working with the computer to deal with.\n\n440\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.430\nBut probably by far the most challenging\none, if you start off, right,\n\n441\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.270\nis understanding that you need to make\nsure you have your own user account, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.850\nAnd you need to understand why you're not\ngonna be able to launch certain programs,\n\n443\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.650\nand that might be because you are a\nstandard user versus the administrative\n\n444\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.820\nuser as well.\n\n445\n00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.780\nBut keeping those things separated out,\n\n446\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.200\nespecially in the work environment,\nis gonna be very helpful for you.\n\n447\n00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.760\nAnd hopefully will also help protect you,\nas well.\n\n448\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.910\nSo that actually is a lot of information,\nWes,\n\n449\n00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.800\nthat we have available right there for\nthe user to actually deal with.\n\n450\n00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.936\n>> That's right, when it comes down to it,\npassword protect your operating systems.\n\n451\n00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:03.600\nRemember that it is PC, it is a personal\ncomputer, personal computing experience,\n\n452\n00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.475\nmake sure you configure it\naccording to your needs.\n\n453\n00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:08.905\nAnd then also, if you happen\ngonna be supporting an end user,\n\n454\n00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:10.185\nlisten to their needs, right.\n\n455\n00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:12.952\nIf you configure your\ncomputer at a certain way,\n\n456\n00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.726\nthat might not be the way\nsomebody else wants it.\n\n457\n00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:19.312\nThere's no right way or wrong way,\ncustomize it, get in there,\n\n458\n00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:23.767\nwork with the settings and make sure that\nyou have the best experience possible.\n\n459\n00:24:23.767 --> 00:24:25.377\nAnd then if you're supporting somebody,\n\n460\n00:24:25.377 --> 00:24:28.620\nthat you help to make their experience\nthe best it can be as well.\n\n461\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.290\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n462\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.890\nWell, thank you again for helping us to\nunderstand at least the basics in terms of\n\n463\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.110\nthe Windows 7 interface that we're gonna\nbe encountering on a day-to-day basis.\n\n464\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.070\nAnd also thank you for watching.\n\n465\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.900\nGreat place for us to sign off.\n\n466\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.580\nSo for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n467\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.710\n>> And I'm West Bryan.\n\n468\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.012\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 Computing Fundamentals.\n\n469\n00:24:48.012 --> 00:24:55.471\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.790\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.310\nyou're watching\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.580\nWhere we're about to take look in\nto the realm of file management.\n\n6\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.710\nNow, when it comes down to the idea\nof using data onto your computer,\n\n7\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.270\nyou're going to realize that they do\nhave to be managed at some point.\n\n8\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.650\nAnd we need to actually\nunderstand the basics of that.\n\n9\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.930\nAnd who better to help us to\ndo that than Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.250\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n11\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.420\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ronnie for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.750\nThat's right.\nIt's great to be with\n\n13\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.340\nhere with the ITProTV crew.\n\n14\n00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.260\nWe're going to dive right in here and,\njust like Ronnie said,\n\n15\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.850\nwe are gonna be looking\nat file management.\n\n16\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.551\nThe first thing that I wanna do is,\nI wanna talk a little bit about\n\n17\n00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.570\nthe interface that you're gonna use\nto manage your folders and files.\n\n18\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.109\nWe're gonna kinda group\nboth of these together,\n\n19\n00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.990\neven though we say file management.\n\n20\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.552\nAgain, we're also gonna talk\na little bit about folders or\n\n21\n00:00:59.552 --> 00:01:02.176\nmaybe some of you have heard\nthe term directories out there.\n\n22\n00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:03.260\nSo we need to look at that.\n\n23\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.676\nBut we also need to talk about what is the\ninterface that's gonna be used to view and\n\n24\n00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:09.470\nmanage these files and folders.\n\n25\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.746\nSo that as we go through this\ndemonstration describing what a file and\n\n26\n00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:15.350\nfolder is,\nyou'll know that interface pretty well.\n\n27\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.951\nAnd what interface are we talking about?\n\n28\n00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.800\nWell, we're talking about one that's\nbeen around for a little while now.\n\n29\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.340\nAnd it's called Windows Explorer.\n\n30\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.130\nMaybe some of you guys have a newer\noperating system, like Windows 7.\n\n31\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.060\nYou might know it as File Explorer.\n\n32\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.593\nUnderstand guys, it's just a name change.\n\n33\n00:01:27.593 --> 00:01:31.996\nWhat we're talking about is the primary\ngraphical user interface that allows you\n\n34\n00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:33.920\nto manage those files and folders.\n\n35\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.250\nLet's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n36\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.725\nI've got a Windows 7 machine here up\non our screen there, Mister Ronnie.\n\n37\n00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:41.769\nAnd we're gonna launch\nthis little folder icon,\n\n38\n00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:45.547\ndown there at the bottom of our,\nwe talked about our task bar.\n\n39\n00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:49.370\nAnd one of the default icons\nis your Windows Explorer.\n\n40\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.718\nNow when we look at Windows Explorer,\nyou'll see that there's all these\n\n41\n00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:54.938\ndifferent boxes here,\non the left-hand side.\n\n42\n00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:58.490\nYou have what's known as\nthe tree hierarchy, if you will.\n\n43\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.600\nThe context pane is on\nthe right-hand side.\n\n44\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.640\nExcuse me a minute,\nmake sure I get that right.\n\n45\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.050\nAnd notice that we have all\nthese different locations.\n\n46\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.160\nKinda zoom in here.\n\n47\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.460\nWell, this is what's known as a file\nhierarchy or a directory hierarchy.\n\n48\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.040\nAnd if I happen to open one\nof these locations up, well,\n\n49\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.090\nyou're gonna see that there\nare a series of folders here.\n\n50\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.079\nIf I happen to, let's say,\nmaybe get to the desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.033\nWell, I can create this little,\nwe'll just call it an icon for now,\n\n52\n00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:33.121\nI can create this little icon.\n\n53\n00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:35.410\nWe'll call it Test.doc, if you will.\n\n54\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.879\nSo notice, oop, or I'll say dco.\n\n55\n00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.905\nIf you can help me out there\nwith my spelling on doc,\n\n56\n00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.381\nthat would be great there, Ronnie.\n\n57\n00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:44.575\n[LAUGH] I'll go ahead and\nrename that to what it's supposed to be.\n\n58\n00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:48.707\nSo you can see that even though,\nwhen we talk about managing files and\n\n59\n00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:52.781\nfolders we talk about it being\nthe Windows Explorer that we do this.\n\n60\n00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.170\nUnderstand that you can also\ndo this to the desktop.\n\n61\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.550\nNow, that being said, we'll look\na little bit more into Windows Explorer,\n\n62\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.990\ncoming up, as we work through this.\n\n63\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.379\nBecause we wanna talk about,\nbasically, what is a file?\n\n64\n00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.310\nWhy do we even need a file?\n\n65\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.560\nWell, a file is really nothing more\nthan an object within your computer that\n\n66\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.700\nstores data.\n\n67\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.490\nNow when we say storing data,\nit can store different types of data.\n\n68\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.690\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be\na file that just contains textual\n\n69\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.540\ninformation that we're gonna read.\n\n70\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.000\nIt could contain textual information that\nthe operating system needs to read as\n\n71\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.530\npart of it's functionality.\n\n72\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.240\nIt could be a video file, if you will,\nthat contains some kind of graphical data.\n\n73\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.630\nBut one of the things that we wanna make\nsure is that we really do understand\n\n74\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.160\nthe file itself and\nhow we apply it to our storage.\n\n75\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920\nIf you remember,\nwe were talking about our storage.\n\n76\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.871\nAnd one of the things that we had\nmentioned in our storage episode\n\n77\n00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:46.761\nwas a little bit about partitioning and\nformatting with file systems, if you will.\n\n78\n00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:48.025\nAnd then, finally,\n\n79\n00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:52.247\nusing that storage once we had everything\nset up the way we wanted to go.\n\n80\n00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:55.820\nWe'll talk a little briefly here\nabout what a folder is, as well.\n\n81\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.720\nIf a file contains an object that\ncontains data, what is a folder?\n\n82\n00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.738\nWell, a folder can contain data, as well.\n\n83\n00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:06.399\nBut typically what it does is it's used to\ngroup your data together based on however\n\n84\n00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.010\nit is that you wanna find it.\n\n85\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.890\nMakes it easier to find your data\nwhen you can group it together in\n\n86\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.150\na single location.\n\n87\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.590\nAnd that's essentially what a folder is.\n\n88\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.160\nA folder is really an object\nthat stores multiple files,\n\n89\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.830\nand even other folders, too.\n\n90\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.980\nNow let me show you this real quick here\nin our interface, as we continue through.\n\n91\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.806\nI can also make a folder on the desktop,\nas well.\n\n92\n00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:30.549\nAnd we'll just call this, again, Test,\nbecause I'm very creative here for\n\n93\n00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:31.790\nsure today.\n\n94\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.550\nNotice that I have this icon,\nthis pretty little icon.\n\n95\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.940\nLooks like a little manila envelope there.\n\n96\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.090\nWell, that's what we get inside\nof the graphical user interface.\n\n97\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.940\nAnd we see it as a way that I can\nturn around, and take this file, and\n\n98\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.390\nI could group it together, right?\n\n99\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.567\nAnd it now is inside of that test folder.\n\n100\n00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:51.670\nSo keep in mind, files contain the data\ninside of them and folders can group that\n\n101\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.970\ndata together in a way that makes it\neasier and more efficient to manage.\n\n102\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nwhen we start taking a look at this,\n\n103\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.740\nyou might be wondering what's the big deal\nthat Wes moved a file inside of a folder.\n\n104\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.880\nWell, it is all about the idea of location\nand the computer being able to find it.\n\n105\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.783\nAnd what we're normally talking about\nthen is what we call a file path.\n\n106\n00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:16.652\nA file path is part of that\nhierarchy that Wes was showing us.\n\n107\n00:05:16.652 --> 00:05:20.842\nIn which if we find a larger object, we\ncan always go into that larger object and\n\n108\n00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:23.940\nbe able to find additional\ninformation within it.\n\n109\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.330\nAnd then we may even find other\nfolders inside of that as well, and\n\n110\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.390\ncontinue to do that.\n\n111\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.620\nWes, if you'll bring up\nthat File Explorer again.\n\n112\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n113\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.780\n&gt;&gt; On your computer and that way\nwe'll actually be able to see that.\n\n114\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.440\nNotice that right up there\nat the top of the screen,\n\n115\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.430\nthat is what we call that file path,\nand Wes, point that out for us here.\n\n116\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.300\nAnd if you'll notice\nthat the naming of that.\n\n117\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.320\nFrom left to right,\n\n118\n00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.620\nyour actually seeing a very generic,\nthe largest unit that we saved data on.\n\n119\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.210\nAnd then as you move to the right\nit becomes more specific.\n\n120\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.920\nSo you might be wondering, well,\nwhy do I need to know that?\n\n121\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.610\nBecause very easy,\nwhen you're first working with computers,\n\n122\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.420\nto simply say I need to save this file,\nand then go, you wanna know something?\n\n123\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.620\nI saved the file but I don't remember\nexactly where that file went.\n\n124\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.450\nWell, this is how you can always tell\nwhere you can locate your files.\n\n125\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.240\nAnd so when you start moving objects\nthat are on your desktop into folders,\n\n126\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.410\nit means you also have to actually know\nwhere the path of that is going to be or\n\n127\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.290\nthe location so\nthat your operating system can find it.\n\n128\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.700\nMost of the time we just click on it and\nyou can find it but\n\n129\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.810\nif you happen to need it, it's right here.\n\n130\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.140\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely Ronnie.\n\n131\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.380\nYou know, in fact, keep in mind that what\nwe see on our graphical user interface,\n\n132\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.550\nwe call it a folder.\n\n133\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.290\nWell, you might ask yourself,\nI've heard maybe this term directory, or\n\n134\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.480\nif you haven't, maybe that's\nthe first time you've heard it.\n\n135\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.605\nI don't want you guys to worry about\nthat term, directory versus folder,\n\n136\n00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.795\nbecause really they're interchangeable.\n\n137\n00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:49.715\nKeep in mind that in the earlier days, for\ninstance, if we had a command prompt open\n\n138\n00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:53.705\nand I wanted to look and\nsee at what folders were available.\n\n139\n00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.931\nNotice that it calls them DIRs, here?\n\n140\n00:06:55.931 --> 00:07:00.417\nWell, that's because I don't have this\ngraphical icon to represent these.\n\n141\n00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:04.022\nSo they're called directories here inside\nthe command prompt and command line.\n\n142\n00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:07.700\nAnd this isn't really anything new to\njust Windows or specific to Windows,\n\n143\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.007\nit's also in the other\noperating systems too.\n\n144\n00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:13.913\nWhen we're largely in our text-based\ninterface, they were called directories.\n\n145\n00:07:13.913 --> 00:07:16.059\nJust know that if we say directories or\nfolders here,\n\n146\n00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:19.030\nwe're gonna use that term probably\ninterchangeably a little bit.\n\n147\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.660\nJust know, don't let it confuse you and\nthink that there's something else here.\n\n148\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.500\nThey're both one and the same.\n\n149\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.470\nNow that being said, we see these\nin the graphical user interface.\n\n150\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.750\nWe've seen these also in this way, the\ncommand or the text-based interface, too.\n\n151\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.210\nNow how is it the we actually apply?\n\n152\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.185\nHow do we get a file on our storage?\n\n153\n00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.952\nI gonna kinda back up and\nrecap what we did on our storage episode,\n\n154\n00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:42.080\nlike I mentioned in\nthe beginning of the episode.\n\n155\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.060\nRemember what we did as we partitioned,\nwe sectioned off,\n\n156\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.950\nwe divided up that hard drive in\na format that was to our liking.\n\n157\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.020\nAnd then what did we do?\n\n158\n00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.102\nWe applied a file system.\n\n159\n00:07:52.102 --> 00:07:55.452\nI did it really quick because I wanted to\nshow you guys here a little bit more about\n\n160\n00:07:55.452 --> 00:07:56.213\nthe file system.\n\n161\n00:07:56.213 --> 00:07:58.988\nSee, the file system is very,\nvery important, right?\n\n162\n00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:01.936\nWhen you are building a house,\nyou put the walls in the house,\n\n163\n00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:04.995\nbut a lot of times it is up to\nthe homeowner to come in and say okay,\n\n164\n00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:07.460\nwell this is going to be\nthe kids' bedrooms right?\n\n165\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.376\nOr maybe you have two bedrooms for\nyour kids.\n\n166\n00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:12.180\nThis is going to be my son's bedroom and\nmaybe my daughter's bedroom, and\n\n167\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.800\nthis is going to be my wife and\nmy bedroom right there.\n\n168\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.320\nBut that's really up to\nthe homeowner to say, okay,\n\n169\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.320\nnow that we've got these containers,\nthese divisions within the house,\n\n170\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.900\nwe tell maybe the architect or\nthe builder what we want that room to be.\n\n171\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.180\nWell, it's not really much different\nby analogy to a hard drive.\n\n172\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.100\nWhen you divide it up,\nyou put the walls in the hard drive,\n\n173\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.020\nthese are the partitions, but\nnow you have an empty container and it\n\n174\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.430\nreally doesn't do you any good, and that's\nwhere the file systems come into play.\n\n175\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.970\nBecause what you're going to be doing\nthere is you're going to be taking and\n\n176\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.190\napplying a logical structure and now\nthe operating system can work with that.\n\n177\n00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.220\nNow see, I do that inside of here.\n\n178\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.300\nYou'll see there's a file here.\n\n179\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.230\nBut what you don't see underneath\nthe hood is a file system, and\n\n180\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.040\nwe want to take a little bit here and\njust kind of talk about file systems.\n\n181\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.239\nAnd we'll talk about some of these\nother characteristics here in a second.\n\n182\n00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.775\nBut what I really want\nto just talk about for\n\n183\n00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:07.400\nnow is some of the file systems\nthat we have available to us.\n\n184\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.790\nKeep in mind,\nsome of these you might not encounter.\n\n185\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.280\nI just put them up here because.\n\n186\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.050\nWe figured we want you\nto be aware of them.\n\n187\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.900\nPrimarily, the one right there in\nthe middle NTFS is going to be\n\n188\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.430\nthe one that we're\ndealing with in Windows.\n\n189\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.310\nBut going back to the hold\ndays right we have what's\n\n190\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.280\nknown as the file allocation table FAT.\n\n191\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.380\nAnd this was when drives, for\n\n192\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.520\na day and age when drives didn't\nhave a very large capacity.\n\n193\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.140\nSo it was a file system again that\nlogical structure that was applied\n\n194\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.840\nto the physical media, but it did have\ndrawbacks, right, fat being one of those.\n\n195\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.290\nOlder file systems, it really,\nit had some limitations.\n\n196\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.830\nAnd again, one of the things that it\nhad was, you didn't have security.\n\n197\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.560\nIt didn't have a recovery\nfunction built in,\n\n198\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.390\nwhich some of the later file systems that\nwe'll just brief over here, will have.\n\n199\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.420\nSo It was really restrictive in\nthe fact that as the capacities of\n\n200\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.830\ndrives started to get larger and\nlarger and definitely well beyond 4 gigs,\n\n201\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.480\nlike we have files that are 15\ntimes the size of that alone today.\n\n202\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.440\nWe had to find something different that\nwould scale up a little bit better and\n\n203\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.670\nthat's where FAT32 comes in.\n\n204\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:16.190\nFAT32 actually scales up to partition\nsizes of around two terabytes.\n\n205\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.530\nIf you remember, one of the things that\nRonnie had pointed out in a prior episode,\n\n206\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.780\nwe talked a little bit about\nwhat does that even mean?\n\n207\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.820\nTerabyte, what are you even talking about?\n\n208\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.805\nLet's recap that so\nyou understand that too.\n\n209\n00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:27.765\nRemember we have one bit.\n\n210\n00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:31.055\nIt's the smallest measurement of our data.\n\n211\n00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:34.245\nAnd then we have bytes,\nthat's a grouping of eight bits.\n\n212\n00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:36.555\nAnd then from bytes we get to kilobytes.\n\n213\n00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:37.965\nThat's 1,000 bytes.\n\n214\n00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:40.655\nMegabytes is 1,000 kilobytes.\n\n215\n00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:42.865\nAgain, one gigabyte is 1,000 megabytes.\n\n216\n00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:46.600\nAll the way up to a terabyte,\nwhich is 1000 gigabytes.\n\n217\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.260\nSo when we say that FAT32 scales up\nto a 2 terabyte partition we want\n\n218\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.940\nyou to know that also you could\nsay that a 1000 or 2000 gigs.\n\n219\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.160\nNow, because of this,\nit made it better for\n\n220\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.240\nlarger drives that were coming\non the scene but There's\n\n221\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.020\na problem with FAT32 when it comes down to\nit we don't have security that we can do.\n\n222\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.710\nAnd when I say by security, right?\n\n223\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.580\nI've got a file that I need to protect for\nRonnie because it's got\n\n224\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.680\npatented trade secrets, and maybe Ronnie,\nmaybe I don't even have access to that.\n\n225\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.190\nRonnie's the only one that should.\n\n226\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:22.130\nWell the problem is with FAT32 we didn't\nreally have a way that I could lock,\n\n227\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.200\nthat to where only Ronnie could see it.\n\n228\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.840\nWe could use passwords\nin our computers and\n\n229\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.580\nthen just hope that it's stored on the\ncomputer that nobody share the password.\n\n230\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.900\nSo, that's where we get the one that\nwe're going to spend the most time in and\n\n231\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.770\nthe one that we're demonstrating\non screen comes to play, and\n\n232\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.420\nthat's NTFS,\nthe new technology Filesystem.\n\n233\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.820\nEven though it says new technology, it's\nan old technology, it's been around for\n\n234\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.860\na while,\ngoes back to the days of Windows NT,\n\n235\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.000\nthe one of the predecessors to Windows 95,\nand in those days\n\n236\n00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.090\nwhere operating systems were starting\nto require a little bit more security.\n\n237\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.230\nAnd that's what NTFS bring in, not only\ndoes it scale up to larger drives than\n\n238\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.580\nFAT, but it also, it has the same\nlimitation of FAT 32 and the fact that you\n\n239\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:11.900\ncan only have a 2 terabyte partition,\nbut now I input some security features.\n\n240\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.490\nSomething called permissions.\n\n241\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.660\nWhere I can give somebody a level\nof access that I want them to have.\n\n242\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.920\nRonny says hey nobody can see this,\nthis is a patented trade secret.\n\n243\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.800\nLet's say I'm the administrator\nI'm not privy to that information.\n\n244\n00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.520\nRonnie can mark it as read only and\nonly on his account.\n\n245\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.810\nCan he give us security control\nthat says he can access it.\n\n246\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.220\nA couple of these other ones here guys.\n\n247\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.820\nI just throw them out here for\nyou guys just so\n\n248\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.750\nyou're aware of them, because we've\nbeen briefly mentioning Unix, Linux,\n\n249\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.200\nwe Mentioned a little bit of Mac here,\nthe OS10.\n\n250\n00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.110\nSo inside of your Linux systems,\n\n251\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.090\nyou're gonna use things like\nEXT the extended file system.\n\n252\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.600\nEXT 2, 3, and 4.\n\n253\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.050\nAnd they have their different benefits.\n\n254\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.600\n3 being a little bit better\nrecovery if you will and then 4.\n\n255\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.470\nBeing more current.\n\n256\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.040\nAnd then you have a higher article\nsystem plus which is also called\n\n257\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.100\nsometimes the MacJournal,\nOS Journal file system I believe and\n\n258\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.340\nthis is something that you're\ngonna see inside of OS10.\n\n259\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.960\nNow let's step back from all of\nthat overwhelming information and\n\n260\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.270\nunderstand again why we\neven went through that.\n\n261\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.420\nKeep in mind that file systems\ncome in different flavors and\n\n262\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.650\nthey have their benefits and drawbacks.\n\n263\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.770\nYou have to consider which\none you're gonna use.\n\n264\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.730\nYou might say well, if I'm in the Windows\nenvironment am I only gonna use NTFS?\n\n265\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.290\nWell for the most part yes but\n\n266\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.170\nyou have to keep in mid that there's still\nreasons that you might use fat 32 because\n\n267\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.110\nit still does have its place\nhere in this day and age.\n\n268\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.510\nSo with that being said, knowing\na little bit about those file sizes,\n\n269\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.410\nhopefully that will help make it a little\n\n270\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.850\neasier when you need to choose maybe\nwhich one you're going to use.\n\n271\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.320\nI'll tell you what.\n\n272\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.850\nYou might find yourself\nformatting like these little\n\n273\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.380\nthumb drives like we've been mentioning.\n\n274\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.710\nYou might find that you need to format\nthem with something like FAT 32 because\n\n275\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.140\na piece of application\ncan only be seen on that.\n\n276\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.240\nBut that means you can still\nplug it into a Windows machine,\n\n277\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.980\nyou could plug it into an OS X machine.\n\n278\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.000\nYou could even plug it into a Linux\nmachine and it can be read, but\n\n279\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.680\nit does lose some of those abilities and\nsome of the security abilities.\n\n280\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we really want to\nemphasize here between the different types\n\n281\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.970\nof file systems, even though the majority\nof the time if you're working with\n\n282\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.430\na Windows computer you'll probably\nrun into the Windows NT or the NTFS\n\n283\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.980\n&gt;&gt; Type of files system.\n\n284\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.890\nBut if you are working in an environment\nwhich there are going to be\n\n285\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.090\nmultiple different types of\noperating systems out there,\n\n286\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.080\nyou may also consider using FAT as well\nand the reason why is that you tend to\n\n287\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.740\nactually move files between those\ntypes of systems if you do so.\n\n288\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.040\nAnd if you don't, in other words,\nif you go on format something like that,\n\n289\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.640\nthumbdrive with NTFS\n&gt;&gt; Is very difficult if you happen to move\n\n290\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.040\nover to a Linux machine to be\nable to read a file on there, or\n\n291\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.800\neven to that MAC OS 10.\n\n292\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.410\nSo smaller drives and thumb drives,\nnormally when you end up buying them,\n\n293\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.720\nthose flash drives.\n\n294\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.980\nThey're normally formatted with\nthe FAT 32 file system on it anyways.\n\n295\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.060\n&gt;&gt; Does it mean you can't change it?\n\n296\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.160\nNo, you definitely can, but if you're not\nsure whether you're going to be using\n\n297\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.150\nthis between Mac and Windows,\nwell keep it at FAT32 and\n\n298\n00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.420\nthat way some of the files will\nbe able to be read between them.\n\n299\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.350\nThe limitation again is gonna be\nthe file size more than anything else.\n\n300\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.470\nWhen you start moving them.\n\n301\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.550\nBut overall though, that's the key.\n\n302\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.610\nIf you happen to format\nthis only with NTFS,\n\n303\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.730\nyou try to put it into a MAC machine.\n\n304\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.100\nIt's just not going to be able to,\n\n305\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.750\nwell you won't be able to\nwrite to it I should say.\n\n306\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.990\nYou can actually perfectly read off of\nthis to actually pull data from it.\n\n307\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.100\nOnto your Mac.\n\n308\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.750\nBut if you try and copy stuff onto it,\n\n309\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.261\nit's going to say I don't\nrecognize that file system.\n\n310\n00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:46.235\nSo, you will run into some issues there.\n\n311\n00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:47.317\nBut for the majority of us,\n\n312\n00:15:47.317 --> 00:15:50.438\nthat's what we really think about when\nwe start thinking about file systems.\n\n313\n00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:55.276\nSo that is kind of a key when you start\nto understand about why these file\n\n314\n00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:57.150\nsystems are important.\n\n315\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.150\n&gt;&gt; You know, Ronnie, you made a good\nmention of something that I forgot\n\n316\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.100\nto talk about,\nis what is the limitation of file sizes.\n\n317\n00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.835\nIn fact they're 32 so\nI'm glad you brought that up.\n\n318\n00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:08.465\nRemember, what Ronnie's talking about,\nthat limitation it's four gigs.\n\n319\n00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:11.145\nIt means I have a file size and\nit can only be four gigs.\n\n320\n00:16:11.145 --> 00:16:13.405\nNow, if any of you out there,\nmaybe not into computers but\n\n321\n00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:14.695\nmaybe you're into digital photography.\n\n322\n00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:17.660\nYou'll know that high definition\nvideos a four gig file.\n\n323\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.230\nThat's gonna chew up a video.\n\n324\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.567\nRight, a video could be two or\nthree times the size of that today.\n\n325\n00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:25.639\nSo again,\nknow that it does have it's limitations.\n\n326\n00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:26.820\nI'll give you another example.\n\n327\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.140\nIf you're installing an operating system,\nyou have the ability to load\n\n328\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.700\nthis software that we've been using\non one of these thumb drives but If\n\n329\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.870\nthat software happens to be over the size\nof four gigs, well FAT32 is not an option.\n\n330\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.228\nSo just like Ronnie said,\ndo a little bit of research first and\n\n331\n00:16:41.228 --> 00:16:43.887\nmake sure that you choose\nthe right file system.\n\n332\n00:16:43.887 --> 00:16:46.020\nSo enough talking about the file systems.\n\n333\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.450\nLet's show you how you apply\none of the file systems.\n\n334\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.530\nAs we're talking about files and folders.\n\n335\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.990\nI got my Windows 7 machine here.\n\n336\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.650\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n337\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.390\nplug one of these USB drives into\nthe USB port on the machine.\n\n338\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.320\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at it.\n\n339\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.660\nNow it's all ready been formatted.\n\n340\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.340\nThis is one that I had prior to this show.\n\n341\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.100\nBut I want to take you to the process\nof just formatting and applying,\n\n342\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.786\nor picking and choosing a file system.\n\n343\n00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:13.600\nSo that you're gonna be aware of it in\ncase that you decide to use this yourself.\n\n344\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.145\nIf we look over here I can see\nthat underneath Local Disk\n\n345\n00:17:17.145 --> 00:17:20.860\n(C:) if I was to choose Local Disk,\nactually let me choose Computer so\n\n346\n00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.060\nyou guys can see it\na little bit better there.\n\n347\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.425\nNotice that I've got a series\nof drives here, right?\n\n348\n00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:31.280\nI've got a couple of drives, and\nI've also got this USB data drive here.\n\n349\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.770\nI went ahead and named it so we can see\nwhich one it is that we're formatting.\n\n350\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.380\nIf I decide that I want to format this,\nI can right click on this.\n\n351\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.280\nAnd you'll see an option right here\nthat lets me format if I want to.\n\n352\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.340\nNow when I choose Format,\nwhich is what we're gonna do,\n\n353\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.090\nlet me back out of here and make it\na little easier to see for you guys.\n\n354\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.300\nAs it disappears, there we go.\n\n355\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.790\nThis is our format screen, guys.\n\n356\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.320\nVery basic, there are other\nways that you could do this.\n\n357\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.160\nYes, if you wanted more advanced approach,\n\n358\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.070\nyou could drop down with\nthe command-line and do this.\n\n359\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.810\nYou can also do this in a component\ncalled Disk Management.\n\n360\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.980\nOne of the great things is you don't\nhave to know how to do those other more\n\n361\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.980\nadvanced methods of formatting.\n\n362\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.810\nYou can do it right here.\n\n363\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.320\nJust right-click on the drive and\nsay okay I wanna format it.\n\n364\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.200\nNotice that we have the default as fat 32,\n\n365\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.710\nif I choose a drop down there's\na couple of options here.\n\n366\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.930\nNTFS, there's another one\nin here called exfat and\n\n367\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.610\nexfat is just one that'll\nallow you to do rights.\n\n368\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.500\nRemember what Ronnie said,\n\n369\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.310\nif you plug this NTFS drive into a MAC\nyou can read but you can't write to it\n\n370\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.780\nX fat is one Microsoft and both Mac can\nuse so they can do interchangeable.\n\n371\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.400\nYou can plug this into a Mac and\nyou could still write and read from it.\n\n372\n00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.300\nSo just mention that one there too.\n\n373\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.010\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose NTFS.\n\n374\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:42.810\nAll right.\n\n375\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.490\nAnd the difference between a Quick Format,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n376\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:46.730\ndo a Quick Format.\n\n377\n00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.170\nA Quick Format just means just go ahead\nand do a high-level formatting and\n\n378\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.550\nget on with the show.\n\n379\n00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.390\nIf I uncheck this, then what's gonna do is\nit's gonna check every little location on\n\n380\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.980\nthat drive, making sure that it\ndoesn't have any errors in it.\n\n381\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.040\nSo for the sake of our show [LAUGH] so\n\n382\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.960\nwe don't wait 30 minutes on a 14 gig\ndrive, maybe to potentially format.\n\n383\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.390\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo the quick format.\n\n384\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.180\nHonestly I've never had\na problem with this,\n\n385\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:15.045\nif they start out NTFS a lot of times\nI do find with the quick format.\n\n386\n00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:18.580\nAnd we'll choose start, and it is letting\nyou know, remember when you format\n\n387\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.980\na drive, please guys back up the data\nthat's on it cuz you're gonna lose it.\n\n388\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.470\nAnd if it's important information and you\nslap it in there, you don't look at it,\n\n389\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.730\nand you format it, you could have\ndocuments, maybe your family photos,\n\n390\n00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.480\nthat you're gonna completely erase.\n\n391\n00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.650\nAnd it can be very difficult\nto ever get those back.\n\n392\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.359\nNot saying that you can't, but\n\n393\n00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:39.849\na lot of times you'll have to pay a pretty\ngood price to recover that information, so\n\n394\n00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:43.473\nbe careful on that and I won't tell\nyou how I know that either [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:45.369\nAll right so it grays out a little bit and\n\n396\n00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:48.082\nwhat it's doing you can't\nsee it right here on camera.\n\n397\n00:19:48.082 --> 00:19:51.854\nBut you'll just have to take my word for\nit right that you can see the little light\n\n398\n00:19:51.854 --> 00:19:55.289\nthe activity light just like you would\nlook on the front of a computer when\n\n399\n00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:59.233\nthe hard drive internally in your machine\nIs going crazy doing reads and writes well\n\n400\n00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:03.151\nthat's what's going on in this machine\nhere, this little USB thumb drive here.\n\n401\n00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:06.902\nAll right and you can see let's me\nknow that the formatting is complete,\n\n402\n00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:07.590\nwe are done.\n\n403\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.870\nSo we can back out of there.\n\n404\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.890\nAnd we can close the format option down.\n\n405\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.130\nNow I'm going to go back\nto Windows Explorer.\n\n406\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.480\nNotice that I told you you launch Windows\nexplorer down there from the task bar.\n\n407\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.530\nWell any folder that you click\non I just want you to know\n\n408\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.700\nthat also launches Windows\nexplorer here too.\n\n409\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.200\nSo you can see that we now have our data\n\n410\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.510\ndrive it's got a format that\nwe want to apply to it.\n\n411\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:35.520\nAnd if I decide here that I want to create\na new text document I can do that now and\n\n412\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.160\nI can say my Text doc.\n\n413\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.450\nRight, so now we have something\nthat the operating system sees,\n\n414\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.040\nit can work with it, and it can use it.\n\n415\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.170\nOne of the last thing I would like to\ntalk about here is in this episode is,\n\n416\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.970\nhow is it that the operating\nsystem is associating this file,\n\n417\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.780\nnotice how it has a little notepad,\nlike a sheet paper with some lines here?\n\n418\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.060\nWhy is it doing that?\n\n419\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.020\nWell, that's there is\nsomething known as extensions.\n\n420\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.220\nAnd very basically guys extensions all\nthey do is they tell the Operating System\n\n421\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.230\nhey this is the type of file this is.\n\n422\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.350\nRemember I told you there is a video\nfile sometimes files contains textural\n\n423\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.450\ninformation that tell the Operating System\noperate in this fashion.\n\n424\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.980\nWell it does that by looking at\nthat extension and saying okay,\n\n425\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.050\nI can see this is a .txt,\na text document and\n\n426\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.430\nit looks at a portion of the operating\nsystem and it's got a list.\n\n427\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.000\nThink of it as a check list.\n\n428\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.605\nI've got this TXT, what does it say\nthat I should do with this right?\n\n429\n00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:40.860\nOkay, I see that a text document\nshouldn't be associated or\n\n430\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:46.080\nopen with an application called note pad\nand it makes that, draws that connection.\n\n431\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.930\nNow there are all different kinds of\nextensions that we could go into but\n\n432\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.550\nI just wanna kinda go into\nsome of the basics ones.\n\n433\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.660\nThat you guys might see.\n\n434\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.740\nThere's a whole bunch of them.\n\n435\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.520\nI mean thousands of them\nmore than this right here.\n\n436\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.410\nThe top two that we have the .exe and\n.msi files that you see.\n\n437\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.600\nThose are your installer files.\n\n438\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.310\nWhen I need to install a piece of software\n\n439\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.590\nthat lets the operating system know that\nthis is an application installer, or\n\n440\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:17.050\nsometimes executables are stand alone\napplications and it tells the operating\n\n441\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.630\nsystem this is a piece of software\nthat you need to launch in interface.\n\n442\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.919\nYou need to perform some kind\nof action to get that running.\n\n443\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.360\nThe second line here.\n\n444\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:32.306\nYou could see, again slew of\nacronyms .doc, .ppt, .mdb and .slx.\n\n445\n00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:34.775\nThese are all part of the office suite.\n\n446\n00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:39.179\nSo, if you're, if you're using Microsoft\nOffice you're going to see these little x\n\n447\n00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:42.557\nnext to them just means at a certain\npoint in Office's lifecycle,\n\n448\n00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:45.890\nthey decided that they would\nuse a different type of format.\n\n449\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.050\nSo, today you can also see.\n\n450\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.580\nAnd most likely,\nwe'll see the x extension right there.\n\n451\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.240\nSo it used to be in the earlier days,\nthese were three letter extensions,\n\n452\n00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.032\nthat rule has been broken, there's\nthree and four letter extensions now.\n\n453\n00:22:58.032 --> 00:23:01.717\nRemember what I told you that the files\n[LAUGH] could contain textual information\n\n454\n00:23:01.717 --> 00:23:04.965\nto tell the operating system, hey man,\nthis is what you are gonna do?\n\n455\n00:23:04.965 --> 00:23:06.207\nWell, that's the third line here.\n\n456\n00:23:06.207 --> 00:23:09.451\nThe third line are just\nsome common system files.\n\n457\n00:23:09.451 --> 00:23:13.484\nBe careful with these files because system\nfiles are not like your typical text\n\n458\n00:23:13.484 --> 00:23:17.850\ndocuments in the fact that you should\nnot be opening them and modifying them.\n\n459\n00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.542\nThey tell the operating system how\nto function and when you modify or\n\n460\n00:23:21.542 --> 00:23:26.271\nchange any of these files, you could ruin\nthe functionality of the operating system,\n\n461\n00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:30.090\nbut we do make mention of them here,\nyou've got .sys file and .dll,\n\n462\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.726\n.com .ini and again .bat files .inf files.\n\n463\n00:23:32.726 --> 00:23:35.378\nSo just know that those are kind\nof system files if you will and\n\n464\n00:23:35.378 --> 00:23:38.498\na lot of times we can't see these by\ndefault in Windows explorer because\n\n465\n00:23:38.498 --> 00:23:40.227\nthey don't want us messing with them.\n\n466\n00:23:40.227 --> 00:23:44.859\nThe last line of files here are just some\nof the common multimedia files that you'll\n\n467\n00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:49.373\njust see out there .gif, .jpeg it's\ntwo different flavors there and .tiff.\n\n468\n00:23:49.373 --> 00:23:52.298\nThese are just common graphics files.\n\n469\n00:23:52.298 --> 00:23:54.149\nNow, that being said,\n\n470\n00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:59.160\nthat tells the operating system\nwhat kind of file it is, right?\n\n471\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.910\nIs it a data file, is it a system file,\nis it a graphics file?\n\n472\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:07.000\nDo I launch something like PowerPoint\nwhen you click it, all right?\n\n473\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.750\nBut there's another set\nof characteristics,\n\n474\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.370\nthe last characteristic that I\nthink I'd like to talk about.\n\n475\n00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.710\nAnd it tells the operating system,\nregardless of the application or\n\n476\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.350\nprogram, what do I do with this file,\nand how do I treat it.\n\n477\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.780\nAnd that is something\nknown as an attribute.\n\n478\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.810\nAttributes are a characteristic\n\n479\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.420\nof a file that tell the operating system,\nput this in a read-only state.\n\n480\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.670\nYou know what, take this file and\nhide it from plain view.\n\n481\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.940\nWhy, because the average\nuser doesn't need to see it.\n\n482\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.340\nAnd we're gonna protect Windows [LAUGH] so\nwe're gonna take that out of your view.\n\n483\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.950\nSome of the other things that you could\ndo, the attribute tells when you run\n\n484\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.480\na backup, now we haven't talked\nabout backups, and we will.\n\n485\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.950\nBut when you run a backup, one of the\nthings that it does is it tells you hey,\n\n486\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.410\ninclude this file in your backup.\n\n487\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.340\nYou don't have a copy of him,\n\n488\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.020\nright now if I was to crash,\nyou're gonna lose that file.\n\n489\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.180\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n490\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:02.240\njust show you that real quick, some of\nthose attributes that we have, all right?\n\n491\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.750\nThese are the common ones, there are some\nother ones here that we don't really need\n\n492\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.045\nto get into, but\nthese are the major ones, right?\n\n493\n00:25:09.045 --> 00:25:14.000\nRead-only attribute tells the operating\nsystem, do not let anybody or\n\n494\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.400\nanything, application, program,\nmodify this file in any way.\n\n495\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.890\nCan't make changes to it.\n\n496\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.700\nArchive, that's one of the attributes\nthat tells the Windows backup system,\n\n497\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.500\nhey man, do you have a copy of this?\n\n498\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.050\nNo, you need to keep it in the back,\n\n499\n00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.570\nyou need to include it next\ntime your run your backup.\n\n500\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.070\nSystem, keep in mind,\nsystem denotes it is a system file.\n\n501\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.217\nAnd keep in mind that these\ntrump extensions, all right,\n\n502\n00:25:35.217 --> 00:25:38.958\nI could have a txt document,\nwhich is normally just a text document.\n\n503\n00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:42.402\nAnd if I decide that I put\na system attribute on it,\n\n504\n00:25:42.402 --> 00:25:45.354\neven if it's just my banana bread recipe,\n\n505\n00:25:45.354 --> 00:25:51.094\nbecause it's got the system attribute on\nit, Windows now sees it and protects it.\n\n506\n00:25:51.094 --> 00:25:55.518\nRight, it's protecting itself cuz now it\nsays, hey, this is part of my DNA and\n\n507\n00:25:55.518 --> 00:25:59.850\nif I mess with this, I could cause myself\nsome major harm, so it protects it.\n\n508\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.170\nI'm gonna skip over hidden,\n\n509\n00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.290\nI'll come back to that in a second,\nand the last one is index.\n\n510\n00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.460\nIndexing attribute helps\nthe Windows search functionality\n\n511\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.710\nfind the file quicker.\n\n512\n00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.636\nNow you might say well, you know what,\nwe're gonna speed up Windows, and\n\n513\n00:26:12.636 --> 00:26:14.690\nwe're gonna index everything.\n\n514\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.610\nYou will not speed up Windows.\n\n515\n00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.690\nRemember, indexing is really supposed\nto be done on commonly used files.\n\n516\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.917\nIf you index everything,\nit's kind of a catch 22,\n\n517\n00:26:23.917 --> 00:26:26.365\nyou haven't really indexed anything.\n\n518\n00:26:26.365 --> 00:26:30.371\nSo index does help the search\nfunctionality when you're searching\n\n519\n00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:31.220\nfor a file.\n\n520\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.600\nThe last one there is\nthe hidden attribute.\n\n521\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.130\nAnd that does exactly what I said,\n\n522\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.590\nthat hides it from the view of our file\nmanagement software like Windows Explorer.\n\n523\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.570\nBecause what Windows believes,\nor Microsoft believes is,\n\n524\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.730\nthe average person doesn't need to see\nthese in their day-to-day happenings.\n\n525\n00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.800\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n526\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:57.870\nNotice that if I, on my desktop, you're\ngonna see just a couple of icons, right?\n\n527\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.600\nI've got the Recycle Bin over here,\nand I've got the Test folder here.\n\n528\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.290\nNow, if I decide that maybe I want to see\nsome of these hidden files or folders,\n\n529\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:13.460\nwhat I can do is I can come in here and\nI can choose Organize in\n\n530\n00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:20.010\nWindows Explorer &gt; Folder in Search\noptions, and then this View tab.\n\n531\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:24.770\nAnd I want you to see what happens\nwhen I decide that I'm going to\n\n532\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.800\nuncheck Hide protected\noperating system files.\n\n533\n00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.640\nNow, notice the warning here, guys.\n\n534\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.768\nYou shouldn't be doing this unless you,\nagain,\n\n535\n00:27:32.768 --> 00:27:34.560\nunless you know exactly what you're doing.\n\n536\n00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.260\nAnd I tell you,\nI know a little bit about Windows, and\n\n537\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.300\nI don't change a setting like this,\nso just as a heads up.\n\n538\n00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:45.020\nAnd if I choose Yes,\nthe attribute has changed a little bit,\n\n539\n00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.070\nand and you know what?\n\n540\n00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.050\nI forgot one setting too.\n\n541\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:54.760\nThere's also a setting here that\nsays Keep hidden files out of view.\n\n542\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.690\nAnd that's what I also got to figure.\n\n543\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.175\nNotice that it says I'm gonna uncheck that\nHide protected operating system files.\n\n544\n00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:04.504\nAnd notice this Show hidden files,\nfolders, and drives.\n\n545\n00:28:04.504 --> 00:28:08.443\nI'm gonna go ahead and uncheck that,\nchange the radio button, I should say.\n\n546\n00:28:08.443 --> 00:28:10.570\nWe'll apply that, we'll say OK.\n\n547\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.380\nAnd now I want you to notice that there\nare more files on my desktop than what\n\n548\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.600\nhas been shown by default.\n\n549\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.830\nWe have some configuration files,\nremember I told you system files?\n\n550\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.870\nWell, here's an INI file, all right?\n\n551\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.110\nHere's one of those INI files\nthat we were talking about.\n\n552\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.170\nAnd Windows says,\nlet's keep this out of view here,\n\n553\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.700\nbecause you don't need\nto mess with this file.\n\n554\n00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.690\nWhat does it contain?\n\n555\n00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.030\nI'm not even gonna open it,\nbut just trust me on this one.\n\n556\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.950\nIt contains the current settings,\nmy background settings, my theme settings,\n\n557\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.610\nwhat icons I have on my desktop,\nhow I have the taskbar arranged.\n\n558\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.110\nAnd it saves that for me so\n\n559\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.180\nthat the next time I log into\nthe computer, that whole environment is\n\n560\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.370\nconfigured the way I configured it\nprior to logging out of the machine.\n\n561\n00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.910\nSo that's a couple things there, Ronnie,\nI think the last thing I do wanna mention,\n\n562\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.730\nI know we're running on time,\nis file sharing.\n\n563\n00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.550\nWhen it comes to file sharing, keep in\nmind that file sharing is a way that if\n\n564\n00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:06.630\nsomebody is on another computer,\nthey can connect over a network connection\n\n565\n00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:11.880\nback into your computer, and\nthey can look at those files.\n\n566\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.600\nTypically, we do this by\ncreating a shared folder.\n\n567\n00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.470\nAnd inside of that folder, remember we're\ngrouping those file objects together.\n\n568\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.430\nWhen I share that folder out,\nit now becomes available to\n\n569\n00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.240\nother people on the network so\nthat they can connect to it.\n\n570\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.710\nAnd they can share that resource as well.\n\n571\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.405\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times,\n\n572\n00:29:27.405 --> 00:29:30.435\nthe idea of the file system is not\nlimited to just hard drives then.\n\n573\n00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.800\nWhat we also have to\nrealize in today's world,\n\n574\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.313\nespecially when we are working in a\ncomputer network at a business somewhere.\n\n575\n00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:41.995\nEven though we might be able to transfer\nfiles using things like the flash drive as\n\n576\n00:29:41.995 --> 00:29:45.825\nwell, and\neven larger external types of drives.\n\n577\n00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:48.595\nThe overall nature though,\ninside a business system,\n\n578\n00:29:48.595 --> 00:29:52.555\nis probably going to be that type of file\nsharing that Wes was just mentioning.\n\n579\n00:29:52.555 --> 00:29:56.018\nThe idea here is fairly simple, is that\nit will be all stored in a location.\n\n580\n00:29:56.018 --> 00:30:00.349\nAnd then everybody can gain access to it\nwithout us having to actually pass around\n\n581\n00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:01.870\nmedia at some point.\n\n582\n00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:06.450\nAnd that way we can control a single,\ncentralized storage share instead, and\n\n583\n00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.460\nactually have all those\nfeatures available.\n\n584\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.900\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n585\n00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.460\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n586\n00:30:15.460

00:00:17.210\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.620\nyou're watching\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.420\nWhere we are about to jump into\nthe world of networking and\n\n6\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880\nthe introduction to that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.110\nJust enough to get us comfortable in\nunderstanding the environment that\n\n8\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.650\nwe'll generally be working\nin with computing.\n\n9\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.580\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nWes Bryan?\n\n10\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.730\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.400\nIt's great to be with the ITProTV crew.\n\n13\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.560\nThat's right,\nwe're diving into the world of networking.\n\n14\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.910\nAnd one of the reasons really,\n\n15\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.850\nwe're in a computing environment\nin general anymore today.\n\n16\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.363\nMaybe in the earlier days,\nyou would've been connected to a network.\n\n17\n00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:53.344\nBut it's almost unrealistic to think\nthat your computers today at some point,\n\n18\n00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:56.110\naren't going to be connected to a network.\n\n19\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.391\nSo that's why it's important to understand\neven some of the basics when it comes\n\n20\n00:00:59.391 --> 00:00:59.979\nto networks.\n\n21\n00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.340\nAnd so, let's go ahead and\nstart right there.\n\n22\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.890\nWhy is it that we would even\nwanna have a network at all?\n\n23\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.450\nWell, I want you to think of it as base.\n\n24\n00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.899\nOn a very basic level it's\nabout sharing resources.\n\n25\n00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.960\nSo I'm not sharing anything with anybody.\n\n26\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.130\nI don't believe in file sharing.\n\n27\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280\nWell, that's not really\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n28\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.130\nWhen you make a connection out\nthere to the good old Internet and\n\n29\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.550\nyou, maybe view, maybe Facebook or\nsomething like that.\n\n30\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.300\nMaybe you check your emails.\n\n31\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.120\nThat's all information and guess what?\n\n32\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.270\nYou're connecting to somebody else's\nnetwork in order to get access to that\n\n33\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.220\ninformation.\n\n34\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.993\nAnd even let's just take the Internet and\njust leave it alone for now.\n\n35\n00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:38.847\nLet's just talk about inside\nof our home networks, right.\n\n36\n00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.310\nWe've got a little diagram here.\n\n37\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.030\nWe're going to explain what\nthis means at the top.\n\n38\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.220\nThis local area network\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n39\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.660\nAll right, let's just take\nan average home network, right.\n\n40\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.800\nYou guys, maybe you've seen this,\nmaybe you haven't.\n\n41\n00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.741\nBut a lot of times in just\na home network right,\n\n42\n00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:56.120\nyou're gonna have maybe a desktop, laptop.\n\n43\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.860\nWe're gonna have our mobile phone, right.\n\n44\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.650\nWe might have some gaming consoles there\nand today we've got the smart TVs right.\n\n45\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.082\nWell, all of those things\nare communicating together and\n\n46\n00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:09.032\nif we don't see it on the surface,\nthat's okay.\n\n47\n00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:12.620\nBut understand under the hood, we open\nup that hood and look at the engine.\n\n48\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.720\nThey are all communicating\neither if not with one another,\n\n49\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.998\nthey're at least communicating with a\nsingle device that allows them to do that,\n\n50\n00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.860\nso it's important to understand.\n\n51\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.690\nThat's one of the main reasons\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n52\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.760\nthat we wanna know about\nnetworking in general,\n\n53\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.100\nis just that sharing resources and\nthe communication between devices.\n\n54\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.040\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that networking is\none of these concepts that you have to\n\n55\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.540\nat least understand.\n\n56\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.610\nAnd even though in a work environment,\n\n57\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.790\nyou may not see all of the details\nbehind networking, more than likely,\n\n58\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.690\nyou are going to be part of a network\nwhen you're sitting down at a computer.\n\n59\n00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.370\nAnd even though you might\nbe thinking right now,\n\n60\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.120\nthis is your first forray\ninto working with computers.\n\n61\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.170\nWhy do I really need this?\n\n62\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.634\nIt is about getting access to resources\nthat are beyond what your computer\n\n63\n00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:02.964\ncan have access to at any one point\nin time, if you're isolated alone.\n\n64\n00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:05.610\nAnd so we need to understand\nat least the fundamentals.\n\n65\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.950\nSo when we start talking about this\nidea of the fundamentals then,\n\n66\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.950\nlet's go ahead and break it down\na little bit farther for us, Wes.\n\n67\n00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.900\n&gt;&gt; What is really the difference then,\nbetween my home\n\n68\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.525\nnetwork that you were just showing and\nlet's say a working business network then?\n\n69\n00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:20.495\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n70\n00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.055\nAbsolutely, so\nif we look at a home network,\n\n71\n00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:26.035\na home network is typically\na very small network.\n\n72\n00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:29.195\nNow, if you're one of these people\nthat live in the life of luxury.\n\n73\n00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:33.787\nMaybe you do happen to have a huge\nhome network but for the most part,\n\n74\n00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:38.862\nit is a self contained environment,\nif you will, that is, a lot of times,\n\n75\n00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:43.070\nmost often, it's restricted\nto a single location, right.\n\n76\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.600\nAnd when we talk about that\nsingle location, a lot of times,\n\n77\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.360\nwhat we have is that you\nare in control of it.\n\n78\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.210\nYou have just a handful of devices and\n\n79\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.890\nthose devices communicate\namongst each other.\n\n80\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.910\nVersus something like a corporate,\nnetwork, which could be a series of\n\n81\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.450\nnetworks alttogether,\ncommunicating together with these.\n\n82\n00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.300\nWe've talked about servers in the past,\nproviding resources and\n\n83\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.580\nwe've got these big computers.\n\n84\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.450\nAgain, I call them servers but just\nunderstand, they're just big computers and\n\n85\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.690\nthey're providing resources.\n\n86\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.430\nWell, that communication leads\nto things like productivity,\n\n87\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.320\nleads to things like us having\nthe ability to get our job done.\n\n88\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.270\nBut one of the big differences when it\ncomes to a home network versus a corporate\n\n89\n00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.860\nnetwork is,\nwhat we call scalability, right.\n\n90\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.770\nIn a home network,\nthey're relatively small.\n\n91\n00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.540\nLike I said,\neven if you have a 15-room mansion,\n\n92\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.420\nyou're talking about\na relatively small network.\n\n93\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.920\nWhen you look at a work environment,\n\n94\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.910\na corporate environment,\nthese networks can scale up.\n\n95\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.010\nAnd when I say scale up, I'm not just\ntalking about ten computers, right, Max.\n\n96\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.440\nI'm talking about beyond that,\nmaybe even up to the thousands, right and\n\n97\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.910\nthey usually cost a pretty penny,\nif you will.\n\n98\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.060\nPardon the pun here,\nif you're not in the States,\n\n99\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.470\nbut they cost a lot of money to maintain.\n\n100\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.560\nAnd you typically have dedicated\nteams that manage these networks,\n\n101\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.590\nversus your home network.\n\n102\n00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.110\nUnless you're paying somebody else to\ndo it, like a technician to come in and\n\n103\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.590\nhelp you, for the most part,\nyou're in control of your network.\n\n104\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.210\nYou're the one that's\ngoing to be servicing it.\n\n105\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.360\nYou're gonna be the one that has to\npay for things to get fixed, and\n\n106\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.830\nagain, it's just one of the things is\nabout scale more than anything else.\n\n107\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.360\nNow that being said,\nI do wanna talk about,\n\n108\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.850\nI mentioned just briefly\nthe geographical regions, right.\n\n109\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.450\nAnd I mentioned something known,\nas if we go back to the slide here,\n\n110\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.010\nI talked about a local area network.\n\n111\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.820\nMaybe you've never heard this term before.\n\n112\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.250\nLet's call it LAN right?\n\n113\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.050\nA local area network is one\nthat is self-contained and\n\n114\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.910\nit's a private network right?\n\n115\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.120\nAnd it's just a single\ngeographical location.\n\n116\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.800\nWhen I say that it could a home network,\nit could be a building right?\n\n117\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.160\nEven corporate networks right?\n\n118\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.890\nSo this doesn't lend itself to just\ncorporate networks or just home networks.\n\n119\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.420\nUnderstand that it's an isolated\nnetwork that's self-contained and\n\n120\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.340\nit's in a single location.\n\n121\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.460\nNow, the location in this\ncase could be a building.\n\n122\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.550\nYou could have a couple of floors.\n\n123\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.470\nIt could be the whole\nbuilding the company owns.\n\n124\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.100\nIt could be a house if you will.\n\n125\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.930\nThat's what's known as\na local area network.\n\n126\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.814\nHowever, when you start taking\nsome of these networks here,\n\n127\n00:06:09.814 --> 00:06:12.208\nlet me get out here and\nfind out what I did with that.\n\n128\n00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:16.570\nThere we go, there's one, and\nyou start taking multitudes.\n\n129\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.030\nLet's say that these houses here,\nare each their own individual network.\n\n130\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.180\nAnd their different Internet service\nproviders, that's what an ISP is.\n\n131\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.067\nAn Internet service provider's what\nprovides you your Internet connection,\n\n132\n00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:30.584\nwe'll come back to that in a second here.\n\n133\n00:06:30.584 --> 00:06:34.770\nBut notice, that we have all of these\nlittle networks scattered all over.\n\n134\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.665\nLet's say,\nthey can be all over United States.\n\n135\n00:06:36.665 --> 00:06:38.840\nThey could be across the world, right.\n\n136\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.834\nWell, they're essentially a bunch of local\narea networks inter-networked together\n\n137\n00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:47.216\nthat make a larger network that\nwe call a wide area network.\n\n138\n00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:51.257\nAnd a wide area network by definition,\nin opposite to a LAN,\n\n139\n00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:56.930\nis one that is basically a group of LANs\nthat span multiple geographical locations.\n\n140\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.680\nAnd when we think about geographical, it\ndoesn't have to be necessarily worldwide,\n\n141\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.890\nso it doesn't have to be\nthat large of a scale.\n\n142\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.160\nIt could be the fact that maybe we've\ngot a network here in Gainesville.\n\n143\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.910\nMaybe we've got a network\nthat's over in Atlanta.\n\n144\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.580\nMaybe there's one out on California.\n\n145\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.505\nMaybe somewhere in Los Angeles,\nif you will, San Francisco.\n\n146\n00:07:14.505 --> 00:07:20.117\nWell the collection of those two,\nthat larger perspective if you will,\n\n147\n00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:23.100\nis what makes a wide area network.\n\n148\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.410\nFor the average home user and\nsomebody just getting into computers,\n\n149\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.366\nyou probably will never see one of these\nunless you go onto more advanced studies.\n\n150\n00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.064\nBut for the most part, that's what\nyour ISP is allowing you to do,\n\n151\n00:07:34.064 --> 00:07:36.060\ncommunicate with other networks.\n\n152\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.790\nThat if you back up and you look into\nthem like we're doing right here,\n\n153\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.910\nyou can see it's a larger network\nspanning multiple geographical location.\n\n154\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.044\nSo that is a couple of the terms\nthat you might wanna be aware of,\n\n155\n00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:53.521\njust in basic networking is, the local\narea network versus the wide area network.\n\n156\n00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:57.229\n&gt;&gt; Another one of these terms is what\nwe call personal area network as well.\n\n157\n00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.436\nAnd usually, this is just a small realm of\ndevices that you're probably in control\n\n158\n00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:05.181\nof and a lot of times even though you and\nI don't think about it very often.\n\n159\n00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:09.103\nBut if you have a smartphone on you,\nif you have a laptop on you,\n\n160\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:13.469\nif you're working at home and\nyou really only have just a few devices,\n\n161\n00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:17.761\nthat is your personal local area\nnetwork that normally fits inside of\n\n162\n00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:21.120\nthe context of that local\narea network as well.\n\n163\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.030\nSo those terms that we're really\ntalking about are all about the idea of\n\n164\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.290\ngeographical location with\nthose devices to one another.\n\n165\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.038\nThe smallest of course then would be\nthe personal area network verses the local\n\n166\n00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:36.953\narea network, which is all in one location\nbut probably in the span of a building or\n\n167\n00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:40.444\na single location that in which all\nof the wires are directly connected.\n\n168\n00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:44.785\nAnd then WAN's of course might be your\nconnection from the main office that you\n\n169\n00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:48.732\nmight be working with to branch offices\nthat your company also has maybe\n\n170\n00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:52.910\nthroughout the city or\nmaybe even throughout the country as well.\n\n171\n00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.180\nThese particular types of\nclassifications are not so\n\n172\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.980\nimportant that we have to\nunderstand every detail about them.\n\n173\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.660\nBut we do need to understand them if we're\ngonna be working those companies and\n\n174\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.220\nthey talk about sending you out to\na branch office to work from there.\n\n175\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.460\nAnd you're wondering well,\nhow am I gonna get my files?\n\n176\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.060\nIt's because of this networking stuff that\nwe're actually talking about right now.\n\n177\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.860\nSo Wes, what are some of the details\nthat we need to understand about\n\n178\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.240\nwhat we were talking about here?\n\n179\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Sure, let's go ahead and one of\nthe things it we'll do is we'll dive in on\n\n180\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.080\nsome of the components and aspects that\nyou use in order to tell whether you're\n\n181\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.670\nconnected to a network and where you\nwould go to find that information.\n\n182\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.400\nI'm on my Windows 7 machine here that\nwe've been using throughout this\n\n183\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.500\nseries here, and\nhere's what you're not gonna see.\n\n184\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.190\nYou're not gonna see the wire or\nthe network icon cuz my head is in the way\n\n185\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.860\nright now, but if we were to zoom in down\nhere in the lower right hand corner.\n\n186\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.530\nWe mentioned this when we are talking\nabout the taskbar very briefly.\n\n187\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.080\nThat little monitor icon with\nthe trident pitchfork there if you will,\n\n188\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.800\nthat is our network icon.\n\n189\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.750\nAnd you can see that it tells me that\nI have network access right now.\n\n190\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.680\nIf I was to right-click on this\nwe have a couple of options here.\n\n191\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.410\nThis first option guys,\nit's very basic and it is a big help.\n\n192\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.628\nThis is the Windows Network Diagnostic,\nas they will.\n\n193\n00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:14.020\nIt's a fancy,\n\n194\n00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.230\nfancy term that basically says if you have\ngot a problem with your network and you\n\n195\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.850\nwant some assistance in figuring out what\nis wrong with it, you can launch that.\n\n196\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.060\nHowever the main interface\nthat we go to when we do\n\n197\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.780\nanything with networking typically\nis the second option right here.\n\n198\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.410\nAnd this is something known as\nthe Network and Sharing Center.\n\n199\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.630\nAnd I'll go ahead and open this.\n\n200\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.820\nAnd let me just tell you this\neven though we've been focused\n\n201\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.590\npretty much in Windows 7, I want you\nguys to know that the Network and\n\n202\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.990\nSharing Center has been around for\na little bit.\n\n203\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.030\nIt's something that you can\nsee inside of Windows Vista,\n\n204\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.270\neven though we're not really maybe using\nWindows Vista here, and it looks like\n\n205\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.920\nit's taking a little bit to definitely\nshow me this Network and Sharing Center.\n\n206\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.770\nSo we'll give it a second there.\n\n207\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.630\nLike I said, a little impatient\non how long it took there.\n\n208\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.480\nBut you see that Windows 7, and for those\nof you that maybe have newer operating\n\n209\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.350\nsystems, you also see it in Windows 8,\n8.1, and Windows 10.\n\n210\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.520\nSo that's a great thing,\nyou learn Windows 7 here and\n\n211\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.680\nyou look at what the Network and\nSharing Center is doing.\n\n212\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.800\nAnd you're really ready\nto look at networking and\n\n213\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.190\nsome of the different Windows editions.\n\n214\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.620\nNow very basically here,\nyou can get a pretty quick heads up here.\n\n215\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.110\nYou can see whether you're\nconnected to the internet or not.\n\n216\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.910\nI can see that I'm connected\nto the network here and\n\n217\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.890\nI can see that icon lets\nme know that I have,\n\n218\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.400\nremember we were talking about the LAN,\nthe local area network.\n\n219\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.440\nIt says that I've got connectivity\nin the local network and\n\n220\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.440\nfor me that means the device that manages\nthe information going around the network,\n\n221\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.260\nI do have connection to it.\n\n222\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.660\nNow I can also reach past my local area\nnetwork out there to another network and\n\n223\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.510\nthat's where the internet connection\ncomes into play here too.\n\n224\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.790\nNow you can see what\nactive networks you have.\n\n225\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.865\nIf you If you happen to have a wireless\nnetwork communication as well,\n\n226\n00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.480\nin which a lot of laptops today do.\n\n227\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.875\nThey'll have a wired connection\nthat plugs them into a port\n\n228\n00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:04.615\non the machine if you will, and they'll\nhave a wireless, what they call a network\n\n229\n00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:08.895\nadaptor that uses the radiated energy\nthat doesn't tie it down to your desktop.\n\n230\n00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.085\nYou can move your desk,\nyou can move if you need to.\n\n231\n00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:14.030\nYou might say that one here as well.\n\n232\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.470\nAnd if you do one of the great things is\nthe configuration is just about the same.\n\n233\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.150\nNow I want you to look at this\nlocal area connection here.\n\n234\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.110\nSee we've got another\none of those task links.\n\n235\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.171\nWell, what is that about?\n\n236\n00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:25.630\nLet's go ahead and find out.\n\n237\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.210\nWe'll go ahead and we'll launch this up.\n\n238\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.510\nAnd this takes us to our local area\nconnections status dialogue box.\n\n239\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.290\nI can see and\nwe'll talk a little bit about what this\n\n240\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.490\nstring of characters\nmeans here in a second.\n\n241\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.730\nBut I could see that I've got\nconnectivity to the internet.\n\n242\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.510\nI can see that the media state,\nwhat does that mean, the media state?\n\n243\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.210\nWell that means my network adapter,\nthe card like we've talked about expansion\n\n244\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.330\ncards that handles these communications\non behalf of this computer and\n\n245\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.958\nsending information to other\ncomputers on behalf of this computer.\n\n246\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.760\nThat's the hardware component in there,\nand\n\n247\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.120\nit's letting me know that\nthat connection is turned on.\n\n248\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.060\nWe could turn it off if we wanted to.\n\n249\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.150\nMaybe we wanted to\ndisconnect from the network,\n\n250\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.320\nwe really don't have a reason for that.\n\n251\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.600\nI can also see some other things here.\n\n252\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.320\nI could see how much information\nis going out of my computer,\n\n253\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.960\nmaybe the other computers versus\nwhat's being sent into my computer.\n\n254\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.220\nAnd than we can get more details\nabout the network connections too.\n\n255\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.560\nIf I choose network here it gives us\na little bit more advanced information\n\n256\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.045\nletting me know different characteristics\nof the network connection.\n\n257\n00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:36.625\nAnd one of those is something\nknown as an IP address.\n\n258\n00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:39.265\nNow you can see that we have\nIP address right here, and\n\n259\n00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:43.755\nit's a crazy string of numbers\nhere separated by dots.\n\n260\n00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:46.315\nAnd what does that really mean for us?\n\n261\n00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:50.420\nWell, at very basics,\nif we have network communications,\n\n262\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.830\nwe have to have a way to talk with\nthe network and talk and send.\n\n263\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.350\nRemember I told you it's sending\ninformation and receiving information.\n\n264\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.950\nWell how do we send information and\n\n265\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.150\nhow do we receive that information\nat the appropriate location.\n\n266\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.980\nIf I'm gonna send something to Ronnie's\ncomputer what do I do just call out and\n\n267\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.660\nsay, hey Ronnie.\n\n268\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.450\nWhere's your computer man, I really\nneed to send you some information?\n\n269\n00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.820\nWell, it doesn't quite work that way.\n\n270\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.970\nMuch like if you're gonna have to use\na cellphone, you have to have a number,\n\n271\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:22.120\nit has to be active obviously\nto be able to make a call.\n\n272\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.140\nWell, how about another thing, let's\ncompare it to, well, a street address.\n\n273\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.670\nYou have to understand that these\nIP addresses as they're called,\n\n274\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.520\nit stands for Internet Protocol,\nguys, for the acronym there.\n\n275\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.940\nIt is the way we send and\n\n276\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.960\nreceive communication across our\nnetworks like we were talking about.\n\n277\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.410\nAnd again it works much\nlike a street address.\n\n278\n00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.970\nEvery computer on your network has to be\nunique in what that numerical number is.\n\n279\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.720\nAnd you can think of a certain\nportion of that number is identical to\n\n280\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.250\nevery computer within the network.\n\n281\n00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.730\nAnd then there's another portion\nof that number that is unique to\n\n282\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.380\neach individual computer, so\nlet me make sure I said that right.\n\n283\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.940\nThere's a portion of it that\nall the computers share and\n\n284\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.450\nthere's a portion of it that has\nto be unique between computers.\n\n285\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.960\nYou say well boy that really\ndoesn't make too much sense.\n\n286\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.120\nWell let's go ahead,\nlet me talk about a street address.\n\n287\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.460\nYou guys have seen street\naddresses before right?\n\n288\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.130\nWell, I want you to think about all\nthe houses that are on this street.\n\n289\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.990\nIf we look at this house right,\nthis house is on NW 4th Blvd,\n\n290\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.640\nright, 6933 NW 4th Blvd here.\n\n291\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.960\nAnd what is the street address made up of?\n\n292\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.690\nWell, it's made up of\na unique street name.\n\n293\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.840\nAnd just like an IP address as you have\na portion of an IP address that is unique\n\n294\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.670\nto the network that you're on.\n\n295\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.554\nNow the uniqueness in a street\naddress is between the houses.\n\n296\n00:15:58.554 --> 00:16:02.532\nWe can't have a street name and\njust say to the mail carrier,\n\n297\n00:16:02.532 --> 00:16:04.099\nsend it to NW 4th Blvd.\n\n298\n00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:07.639\nThe poor mail carrier gets to that\nstreet and says, there's 15 houses,\n\n299\n00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:08.999\n16 houses on this street.\n\n300\n00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:11.490\nHow do I know which house to\nsend that information to?\n\n301\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.560\nWell, what does the mail carrier do?\n\n302\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.320\nHe or she, they look at the unique\ninformation on that street.\n\n303\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.695\nAnd in this case,\nit happens to be the house number.\n\n304\n00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:21.670\nNotice how the house numbers are unique.\n\n305\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.579\nSo when I send information to Ronnie,\nright,\n\n306\n00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:27.489\nI wanna send information\nto Ronnie's house,\n\n307\n00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:32.432\nthe mail carrier says, okay,\nRonnie lives at 6933 NW 4th Blvd, right.\n\n308\n00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:34.688\nNow I found the street that he's on.\n\n309\n00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:40.350\nAll right, it's 4th Blvd, and all of these\nhouses uniquely share that information.\n\n310\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.999\nNow I need to find which house is\nunique from the rest, and in that case,\n\n311\n00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.869\nI'm gonna use that number.\n\n312\n00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:52.008\nIf I happen to be on another street,\nright, let say that we're on 6th Blvd.\n\n313\n00:16:52.008 --> 00:16:54.490\nLet's just move this\ndown here a little bit.\n\n314\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.283\nNow I'm on 6th Blvd.\n\n315\n00:16:56.283 --> 00:17:00.015\nWell, 6th Blvd, what is it that\nall the houses share, all right?\n\n316\n00:17:00.015 --> 00:17:04.590\nNotice that all of these house numbers\nare identical to the first street.\n\n317\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:09.767\nAll right, now why is it that these\nnumbers are unique to the mail carrier?\n\n318\n00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:12.630\nWell, it's because of that 6th Blvd,\nright.\n\n319\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.680\nAgain, that first portion or\nthat portion of the address that says\n\n320\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.180\nall of these houses are a part\nof the same street.\n\n321\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.200\nGuess what, let's go ahead and\ntranslate that over to IP addresses.\n\n322\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.947\nAll right, let's just take\nsomething simple like we seen\n\n323\n00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:33.990\nin our IP address that we had\nconnectivity on the Windows 7 machine.\n\n324\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.830\nNotice that I have a series\nof IP addresses here, and\n\n325\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.930\nthese computers are gonna use this\ninformation to send information back and\n\n326\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.610\nforth between each other.\n\n327\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.970\nAll right, I want you to pay\nattention to the numbers themselves.\n\n328\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.970\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and go back\nto the street analogy here, all right?\n\n329\n00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:57.270\nNow just like the street name, and\n\n330\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:03.860\nif a computer is gonna be considered on\nthe same network, it has to have a value\n\n331\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.250\nthat says all these computers share this\nsame value, just like that street name.\n\n332\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:16.297\nSo for us, notice that this portion\nof the address we have, 192.168.0,\n\n333\n00:18:16.297 --> 00:18:21.745\nthen if we look at this computer,\nwe have 192.168.0.\n\n334\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:24.284\nWell, that would essentially\nbe like our street name.\n\n335\n00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:28.129\nAnd that tells us that's a network name,\nif you will, for\n\n336\n00:18:28.129 --> 00:18:31.277\nlack of a better word,\nthat names the network.\n\n337\n00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:36.252\nBut there's another portion\nthat has to be unique to every\n\n338\n00:18:36.252 --> 00:18:40.414\ncomputer on the network,\njust like on a street,\n\n339\n00:18:40.414 --> 00:18:45.100\nnotice that we have 10, .20, .30, .40.\n\n340\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.766\nSo if we break this down,\nevery one of those computers are sharing\n\n341\n00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:52.967\nthe same network name, street name if\nyou will, but each of them have their\n\n342\n00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:57.390\nown unique house number, or in this case,\nthe computer number, we'll say.\n\n343\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.716\nIf we were to be on another network,\n\n344\n00:19:00.716 --> 00:19:04.428\nwhat is it that identifies us\nas being on another network?\n\n345\n00:19:04.428 --> 00:19:07.000\nWell, let's go ahead and\ntake the same analogy.\n\n346\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.438\nNotice that this unique\nnumber is 192.168.1.\n\n347\n00:19:11.438 --> 00:19:12.800\nNotice how they're different?\n\n348\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.558\nWell, if I go to these computers, I want\nyou to see that with these computers,\n\n349\n00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:22.154\nnotice what they share, 192.168.1.\n\n350\n00:19:22.154 --> 00:19:25.495\nAnd again, I won't bore you\nwith the repetition, right?\n\n351\n00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:30.780\nNotice how each one shares those\nfirst three sets of numbers.\n\n352\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.700\nBut when we come back and we look at\nthe last portion of this address,\n\n353\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.150\nit is unique to each one of these\ncomputers, we have 10, 20, 30, and\n\n354\n00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.160\n40, those are like your house number.\n\n355\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.970\nSo when you think of networking,\nyou have to remember that you have to have\n\n356\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.580\none of these type of addresses\nto be able to send information.\n\n357\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.030\nIf Ronnie's computer, I need to send him\ninformation, and I don't have one of these\n\n358\n00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.900\nnumbers, sorry, you can't communicate,\nright, it's just how it's built.\n\n359\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.860\nSo with that being said,\nwhere would we find these numbers, and\n\n360\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.318\nhow would modify them if we needed to?\n\n361\n00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:06.650\nWell, I'm gonna take a second here,\n\n362\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.360\nand let's go back to our Windows\n10 machine, or excuse me,\n\n363\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.900\nWindows 7 machine, and notice that we\nhave a series of numbers right here.\n\n364\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.540\nAll right, so there is my, in this case,\nit's called an IP address and\n\n365\n00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.300\nsome additional information.\n\n366\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.370\nNow I can see that,\nI'm gonna close that down.\n\n367\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.910\nWhat if I need to modify that information?\n\n368\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.090\nAll right, to modify the information,\n\n369\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.830\nwe go to the Properties button,\nback that out just a little bit there.\n\n370\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.451\nAnd from the Properties option, this is\nwhere we get the ability, if we need to,\n\n371\n00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:44.897\nto modify that information, and\nit does look like this machine's chugging.\n\n372\n00:20:44.897 --> 00:20:48.900\nThere we go, took a second there,\npoor old machine is just thinking about.\n\n373\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.209\nAnd notice that we've got\nthat information right there.\n\n374\n00:20:53.209 --> 00:20:58.730\nSo this is where we could modify it if\nwe needed to by choosing Properties.\n\n375\n00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.153\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nyour networking and why you would\n\n376\n00:21:03.153 --> 00:21:07.809\nneed the networks, and a little bit about\nwhat the networks are doing for us.\n\n377\n00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:11.716\nThey're allowing us to connect and\nshare those resources, and\n\n378\n00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:13.681\nthat is very, very important.\n\n379\n00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:16.640\nThe other thing obviously is\ncommunication, I didn't mention it.\n\n380\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000\nI said two big factors,\n\n381\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.052\nthe only thing I've been talking about\nis sharing resources, boils down to it.\n\n382\n00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:26.090\nYou wanna take all the jargon,\nall the technicalities out of it.\n\n383\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.460\nI connect to networks to share resources\nand to communicate, and I do mean not\n\n384\n00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.750\nnecessarily just through social media,\nbut to communicate with other computers.\n\n385\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.860\nNow, so far what we've been talking\nabout are just the network itself.\n\n386\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.500\nThere is another type of media that I want\nyou to be aware of that we communicate,\n\n387\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.108\nand it has been for a while.\n\n388\n00:21:46.108 --> 00:21:50.400\nBut it's becoming even more prevalent\nwith the fact that we have more of these\n\n389\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.326\nmobile-based devices, right.\n\n390\n00:21:52.326 --> 00:21:56.673\nAnd that is something known as WiFi,\nmaybe you've never heard that term before,\n\n391\n00:21:56.673 --> 00:21:57.559\nmaybe you have.\n\n392\n00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:00.475\nI know that a lot of us\nhave heard that name,\n\n393\n00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:04.210\nbut WiFi is a wireless\nnetworking technology.\n\n394\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.639\nAnd what it allows us to do is when\nwe have physical limitations on\n\n395\n00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:11.000\nsetting media, right,\nI've got cable that I need to run, but\n\n396\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.315\nthe problem is I'm trying to run it in\na building that's a historical building,\n\n397\n00:22:15.315 --> 00:22:17.814\nit's been historically protected, right.\n\n398\n00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:21.199\nWell, a building like that I can't just\ngo in and start knocking down walls and\n\n399\n00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:22.920\nrunning cable, all right.\n\n400\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.161\nWell, maybe I don't even have\nthe ability to run cable at all,\n\n401\n00:22:26.161 --> 00:22:28.560\nmaybe there's just\na limitation in general.\n\n402\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.947\nWell, wireless gives us that ability that\nwhere we have the limitations to wired\n\n403\n00:22:33.947 --> 00:22:39.746\nmedia, wired cables, we can't put those\nin there, we can't use those, whatever.\n\n404\n00:22:39.746 --> 00:22:44.110\nThere's obstructions, this allows\nus to bring network connections,\n\n405\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.060\nthe same concept but\nthrough radiated energy.\n\n406\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.430\nIt breaks the bonds of having to be\njust stuck with the limitation to wire.\n\n407\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.045\nNow I do wanna mention just briefly\na little bit of the technologies behind\n\n408\n00:22:57.045 --> 00:23:01.523\nwireless, and it is important that\nyou guys are aware of some of these.\n\n409\n00:23:01.523 --> 00:23:05.742\nI got a little chart here that\nI'd like to show you guys.\n\n410\n00:23:05.742 --> 00:23:08.265\nAll right,\nthere is a standard out there, and\n\n411\n00:23:08.265 --> 00:23:12.341\nwe're not gonna go too much into the\nstandard, other than I want you to know\n\n412\n00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.576\nwhat some of these letters that\nmight be on if you decide that\n\n413\n00:23:15.576 --> 00:23:21.020\nyou're gonna purchase a device that allows\nyou to make wireless connections, right.\n\n414\n00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.187\nYou might see, and maybe not, so I just\nput it in here for sake of completion,\n\n415\n00:23:25.187 --> 00:23:26.870\nan older technology called a.\n\n416\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.974\nThen we have a technology and\nthese letters designations are as this\n\n417\n00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:35.654\nwireless technology progressed,\nas it advanced, as it got more features,\n\n418\n00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:39.977\nthey have these different letter\ndesignations at the end, all right.\n\n419\n00:23:39.977 --> 00:23:44.980\nSo we have commonly,\nwe have the a, b, g, n, and ac.\n\n420\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.495\nAnd I just wanted to show you\nguys what that really means for\n\n421\n00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:50.214\nyou as far as an end user, and\n\n422\n00:23:50.214 --> 00:23:55.046\nas far as maybe somebody that's gonna go\ninto a network and maybe help them out.\n\n423\n00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:59.345\nAll right, with the a devices, and\nthis is the wireless network adaptors,\n\n424\n00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:03.577\nthe expansion cards as well as the\nconnectivity device that would be in your\n\n425\n00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:07.677\nhome that you would use to communicate\nA devices are devices that you're\n\n426\n00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:11.870\nprobably not gonna see too much of\nanymore because they've been around.\n\n427\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.230\nIt's one of the very first wireless\nstandards that was out there so it's old.\n\n428\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.090\nB might still see some B devices and\ncould see D devices.\n\n429\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.870\nWhen it comes to the performance of\nthese devices they're average right.\n\n430\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.780\nBut we have a newer technology, two newer\ntechnologies and even one of them is been\n\n431\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:34.230\naround for a little bit now, which is kind\nof scary how time flies, is an n device.\n\n432\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.810\nI have to say n device was one\nof the best of them so far, and\n\n433\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.220\nthey're getting better, but I really\nlike n because it has great performance.\n\n434\n00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.270\nAll right.\n\n435\n00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.080\nNow when we talk about the best\nperformance right now,\n\n436\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.441\nwe've got devices that end in a little ac,\nAlpha Charlie there,\n\n437\n00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:52.208\nthe ac devices and\nthey have excellent performance.\n\n438\n00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:56.363\nThat's some of the best performance on\nthe market right now because it is some of\n\n439\n00:24:56.363 --> 00:24:58.360\nthe latest and greatest technology.\n\n440\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.510\nThe next thing that I'd like to\ntalk about is the range, right.\n\n441\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.130\nHow much coverage area,\nit's wireless think about it,\n\n442\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.150\nso how much coverage area do we get?\n\n443\n00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.850\nHow wireless are we truly, if you will?\n\n444\n00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.360\nOr how truly wireless are we, I guess\nI could say with better English there.\n\n445\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.400\nThe range, A devices they were short,\nand again they're legacy,\n\n446\n00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.880\nthey're older I don't expect you to\ndeal with them too much if at all.\n\n447\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.030\nB devices and g devices you\ncould still see out there, and\n\n448\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.430\nthey have a pretty long range.\n\n449\n00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.090\nThe n devices have two separate ranges,\nbecause they operate in two different\n\n450\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.270\nways, two different,\nwe'll just call it frequencies for now.\n\n451\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.140\nThey essentially can have a short distance\nor they can have a long distance,\n\n452\n00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.430\ndepending on, so they're kind\nof a middle ground, if you will.\n\n453\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.760\nThe AC devices right now\nhave the best range.\n\n454\n00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.730\nNow the last thing I'd like to talk about.\n\n455\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.030\nAll right, when it comes to your\nwireless devices is compatibility,\n\n456\n00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.490\nbecause some of these\ndevices play nice together.\n\n457\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.460\nThey work well,\neven if they're older devices,\n\n458\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.060\nthey'll work on the newer technology.\n\n459\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.770\nHowever, some of them do not,\n\n460\n00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.490\nand that's why we need to understand,\nwhat we need to understand.\n\n461\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:12.070\nThe A devices, they are and I don't know\nwhy I put that, that is absolutely wrong.\n\n462\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.810\nLet me go ahead and\ncorrect my notes there.\n\n463\n00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.810\nI had all of them in the spectrum\nthere and that's not true.\n\n464\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:25.880\nA devices are also compatible\nwith n devices, but that's it.\n\n465\n00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.850\nIt's A and n, before there was a typo.\n\n466\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.170\nNow, what's really,\nreally cool is that B devices,\n\n467\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.110\nthey're not compatible with the older\nA devices, which is fine for us, but\n\n468\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.670\nthey are forward compatible with g and\nthe n devices.\n\n469\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.870\nSo there's a little, where they place\nnice together, they can shake hands.\n\n470\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:50.100\nIf I've got an n home access device that's\ndoing this wireless communication for\n\n471\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.880\nme but I have a very old b\nnetwork adaptor well guess what,\n\n472\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.700\nit's gonna work on n as well.\n\n473\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.970\nSo that's what we mean by compatibility.\n\n474\n00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:04.910\nG, it's backward compatible with b and\nit's also compatible with n.\n\n475\n00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.928\nNow as we start getting forward here,\nhere's where n,\n\n476\n00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:11.990\nanother one of the reasons I like n is\ncuz it's compatible with all of them.\n\n477\n00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.940\nEven forward compatible with ac, which is\nkinda interesting there that we have a, b,\n\n478\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.590\ng, n.\n\n479\n00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.500\nWell of course it's compatible\nwith itself, I hope so, and ac.\n\n480\n00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.840\nNow the last one here is only\nbackwards compatible as far as n.\n\n481\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.460\nAc is compatible with n, but it isn't\ncompatible with anything farther back than\n\n482\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.500\nthat and that's just due to\nthe frequencies that it's working on.\n\n483\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.700\nSo understand that you do\nhave some compatibility,\n\n484\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.530\nif you don't get communications maybe in\ntroubleshooting aspect it could be because\n\n485\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.410\nyour devices don't play nice together.\n\n486\n00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:49.620\nSo just keep in mind compatibility\nwhen you're thinking about wireless.\n\n487\n00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.070\n&gt;&gt; When we start thinking\nabout these wireless devices,\n\n488\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.080\nthere is clearly a lot of\ntechnicality behind it.\n\n489\n00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.700\nBut the key thing that you want to ensure,\nif you can of course,\n\n490\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.284\nis that the device that you're using to\nconnect into wireless, also of course,\n\n491\n00:28:02.284 --> 00:28:06.110\nwill connect to the wireless access\npoint that you have purchased.\n\n492\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.329\nIf it doesn't, in other words,\nif there's incompatibility there,\n\n493\n00:28:09.329 --> 00:28:11.190\nthey will not end up working.\n\n494\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.470\nThe other thing that we also\nhave to think about of course,\n\n495\n00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.440\nis that wireless by its nature is\nnot secure and you also need to\n\n496\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.050\nimplement some security protocols if your\nalso gonna be using wireless as well.\n\n497\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.080\nAnd so both the devices, as well as the\naccess point that you end up purchasing,\n\n498\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.640\nwill also need to support the same\ntype of wireless standard and\n\n499\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.560\nsecurity standards, as well.\n\n500\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.980\nSo it's kind of key for us, and we're\njust really starting out in computing and\n\n501\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.700\nunderstanding, that if we're\nconnecting into wireless networks that\n\n502\n00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.620\nyou might find out that\nyou have an older device.\n\n503\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.410\nAnd now whatever access point you're\nconnecting to, you find out something.\n\n504\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.120\nThat even though you keep entering\nin the password, it won't connect.\n\n505\n00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.430\nIt could be an encryption\nissue at that point and\n\n506\n00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.310\nthe very fact that your older\ndevice may not support that.\n\n507\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.030\nOr you may find out that you just don't\neven know what the password is to get in,\n\n508\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.450\nyou can do that as well, but\n\n509\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.120\njust kinda realize that that's\nreally where we tend to focus in.\n\n510\n00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.560\nMost of us at this particular site here,\nwe turn on the wireless and\n\n511\n00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.010\nwe're just ready to go.\n\n512\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.680\nAnd most of our devices, even Windows 7,\nif we have a wireless adapter card on our\n\n513\n00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.780\ncomputers, it would generally\nshow the wireless network for us.\n\n514\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.420\nWe just need a passcode, or\nif it's wide open we're ready to connect.\n\n515\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.700\nWe just need to be careful, if it's\nwide open, because that's exactly what\n\n516\n00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.245\nit means, is that somebody can\ngain access to your data too.\n\n517\n00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:26.980\nOkay.\nSo wireless is probably one\n\n518\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.150\nof the most popular methods\nto be able to connect in, but\n\n519\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.855\nwe also need to talk about\nthe internet a little bit too.\n\n520\n00:29:32.855 --> 00:29:34.160\nWes, what do we need to understand?\n\n521\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, the internet, a bunch of\nlocal area networks all holding hands and\n\n522\n00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.000\nsinging Kumbaya.\n\n523\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.290\nNo, that's not exactly what\nwe're talking about, but\n\n524\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.810\nthe internet has been around for a while.\n\n525\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.410\nIt goes back to earlier days of\nthe military doing research and\n\n526\n00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.120\nwanting computers to communicate and\nshare resources as well.\n\n527\n00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.060\nThe Internet, if you will, is something\nthat allows us to take our devices and\n\n528\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.495\nconnect to other networks.\n\n529\n00:29:58.495 --> 00:29:59.090\nOkay.\n\n530\n00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:03.440\nTo connect not just to our local\nnetwork but to connect out there and\n\n531\n00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.330\nget all the various resources\nthat we can have access to.\n\n532\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.420\nNow, let me go ahead and show you a little\nbit about what's going on because I\n\n533\n00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.490\nmentioned a term that I wanted\nto define a little bit more.\n\n534\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.230\nI told you I'd come back and define it.\n\n535\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.610\nSo we have our home network right, and\n\n536\n00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:21.160\nif we don't have connectivity off of this\nlocal area network or off of this home\n\n537\n00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.730\nnetwork, then we're really just\ncommunicating and talking to ourselves.\n\n538\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.965\nNow, there's something known as an ISP.\n\n539\n00:30:27.965 --> 00:30:30.655\nAll right,\nan ISP is an Internet Service Provider.\n\n540\n00:30:30.655 --> 00:30:32.005\nThere's many of them out there.\n\n541\n00:30:32.005 --> 00:30:36.267\nYou've probably seen\nadvertisements on TV for them.\n\n542\n00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:40.655\nAll right, Internet Service Provider\nis a business company, if you will,\n\n543\n00:30:40.655 --> 00:30:45.425\nthat provides either residential,\nresidential and\n\n544\n00:30:45.425 --> 00:30:49.775\ncommercial access to the network and\nalso, additional resources, too.\n\n545\n00:30:49.775 --> 00:30:53.530\nSometimes they provide things\nlike voicemail and, if you will,\n\n546\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:58.310\nemail services too, but the main thing\nis they allow you to connect outbound to\n\n547\n00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:03.510\na massively global network and\nit's various resources.\n\n548\n00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.520\nSo let's go ahead and say that\n\n549\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.620\non your network you're gonna have what's\nknown as a connection point, all right?\n\n550\n00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.970\nThis connection point, if you will, is\ngoing to lead you out to the ISP's network\n\n551\n00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:19.010\nwhich you usually never see, all you\nknow is that when you open up a web\n\n552\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:23.420\nbrowser you can actually get to places\nlike Google, places like Facebook, right?\n\n553\n00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.651\nBut what's going on here is your internet\nservice provider will provide you with\n\n554\n00:31:27.651 --> 00:31:31.458\nsome kind of connectivity device,\nand I've mention some of them here.\n\n555\n00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:35.357\nDialup Modems are relatively old, but\nthey're still out there, Cable modem,\n\n556\n00:31:35.357 --> 00:31:39.081\nDSL modem or even like the wireless\nrouter, like we've been talking about,\n\n557\n00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:42.030\nwireless device if you\nhave a wireless network.\n\n558\n00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.855\nAnd then what you're doing is you're\nconnecting to the ISP's network and\n\n559\n00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:51.757\nthen from their network they allow you\nthe access and the level of access that\n\n560\n00:31:51.757 --> 00:31:56.066\nyou need, according to your subscription,\nout to the internet.\n\n561\n00:31:56.066 --> 00:32:00.553\nNow, the other thing that I would like\nto mention about your subscription or\n\n562\n00:32:00.553 --> 00:32:04.280\nthe service that they provide you\nis something known as an SLA.\n\n563\n00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.913\nA service level agreement.\n\n564\n00:32:05.913 --> 00:32:08.794\nSo if you are having a bad connection and\n\n565\n00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:13.150\nyou think it might be your\ninternet service provider.\n\n566\n00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.820\nUnderstand that when you\nenter into that agreement,\n\n567\n00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:22.690\nthey do have a certain level of acceptable\nperformance that they're gonna offer you.\n\n568\n00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.772\nAnd they're also gonna tell you what that\nminimum level is, that they're gonna be\n\n569\n00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:30.990\nresponsible for, and that's what's known\nas a service level agreement, an SLAs.\n\n570\n00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.972\nMore of the bureaucratic white\npaper that we don't see.\n\n571\n00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:38.012\nBut when you do start the subscription,\nkeep in mind that you're\n\n572\n00:32:38.012 --> 00:32:42.273\ninternet servers provider provide\nthat service does have written in\n\n573\n00:32:42.273 --> 00:32:47.061\na statement somewhere what the acceptable\nminimum level of performance is.\n\n574\n00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:49.740\nAnd again, that's always gonna\nbe based on your subscription.\n\n575\n00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.590\nIf you have a higher tier which\nmeans you pay more money,\n\n576\n00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.080\nyou might have a lot more information that\nyou can send and receive off your network.\n\n577\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.520\nIf you got a medium level,\nmaybe it's less.\n\n578\n00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.320\nAnd if you're really restricted, maybe\nyou don't really have a good connection,\n\n579\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.860\nmaybe you don't have\na very fast connection.\n\n580\n00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.240\nBut again, that's all gonna be\nhindering on that contract and\n\n581\n00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.170\nthat subscription price that you pay.\n\n582\n00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.330\nInternet service providers essentially\ngive you access to the internet\n\n583\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.690\nthrough their networks.\n\n584\n00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:19.210\n&gt;&gt; When we start dealing\nwith these types of terms,\n\n585\n00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.750\nespecially that service level agreement\nand your internet service provider.\n\n586\n00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.860\nJust think about it in this way\nthat the internet service provider,\n\n587\n00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.890\nthis is what they are willing to guarantee\nwhen you connect to their service.\n\n588\n00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.536\nSo you might ask for more, but they might\npoint you to the service level agreement\n\n589\n00:33:33.536 --> 00:33:37.040\nand say, hey here it is,\nthis is as much as we are willing to do.\n\n590\n00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.970\nOr it also protects you in the sense\nwhen you do not actually feel like\n\n591\n00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.740\nthat you're getting that particular\nlevel of support that you need.\n\n592\n00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.000\nYou can always point out their\nservice level agreement and\n\n593\n00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.220\nsay, hey, this is part of\nour service level agreement.\n\n594\n00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.490\nI do not believe I'm getting what\nI believe is happening here.\n\n595\n00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.473\nSo it protects both parties when\nentering into that agreement.\n\n596\n00:33:56.473 --> 00:34:00.291\nIn networking today, especially in\nthis age that we're living in, and\n\n597\n00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:04.309\nyou might be thinking like, well,\nit's only 2016, what do you mean?\n\n598\n00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:08.473\nWell, this is the second\ndecade of the 21st century.\n\n599\n00:34:08.473 --> 00:34:11.528\nAnd what you've got to\nrealize here is that more and\n\n600\n00:34:11.528 --> 00:34:16.007\nmore things that we connect to, that\nwe are accessing today are not gonna be\n\n601\n00:34:16.007 --> 00:34:18.912\nbecause we have purchased them outright.\n\n602\n00:34:18.912 --> 00:34:23.310\nIt's gonna be due to some type of\nan agreement that we signed to use their\n\n603\n00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.910\nparticular services.\n\n604\n00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:27.820\nWhich means, we will be dealing\nwith service level agreements.\n\n605\n00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.551\nSo it could be that you,\ninstead of buying software outright.\n\n606\n00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:33.855\nIt might be that you say, hey, here it is,\n\n607\n00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:36.297\nthis company's software\nthat I need to use.\n\n608\n00:34:36.297 --> 00:34:37.453\nI need to purchase that but\n\n609\n00:34:37.453 --> 00:34:40.990\nthey're telling me that I'm gonna pay\na monthly subscription for it instead.\n\n610\n00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.620\nAnd you'll probably see that's\ngonna be more of the norm.\n\n611\n00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.410\nThe same thing even for\nstorage of information as well.\n\n612\n00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:53.240\nSo, places like Dropbox and OneDrive,\nand a few others that are out there.\n\n613\n00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.760\nThey can offer you a tremendous amounts\nof storage and you just pay a fee for\n\n614\n00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.740\nit as well.\n\n615\n00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.964\nAnd even right here in ITProTV studios,\nwe end up using Office 365.\n\n616\n00:35:02.964 --> 00:35:05.577\nI do not have to have\nthose applications for\n\n617\n00:35:05.577 --> 00:35:09.292\noffice productivity applications\nrunning on my computer.\n\n618\n00:35:09.292 --> 00:35:12.746\nI pay a subscription or\nour company pays a subscription, and\n\n619\n00:35:12.746 --> 00:35:15.537\nwe access them through\nare web browsers as well.\n\n620\n00:35:15.537 --> 00:35:16.752\nIn that way, we have use of that.\n\n621\n00:35:16.752 --> 00:35:20.427\nSo all of these involved those\nservice level type of agreement, and\n\n622\n00:35:20.427 --> 00:35:24.633\nthe same thing between you an your ISP,\nwill also have the same thing as well.\n\n623\n00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:28.007\nSo here in this episode, what we took\na look at in basic networking, right?\n\n624\n00:35:28.007 --> 00:35:32.514\nIs kind of the over all categorization\nhere between the geographically\n\n625\n00:35:32.514 --> 00:35:34.326\nlocated types of networks.\n\n626\n00:35:34.326 --> 00:35:38.552\nIn which we'll generally talk about in\nbusiness demarcation a lot of times.\n\n627\n00:35:38.552 --> 00:35:39.182\nBut then,\n\n628\n00:35:39.182 --> 00:35:43.889\nwe also talked about some of the different\ntypes of networks in terms of access.\n\n629\n00:35:43.889 --> 00:35:47.867\nWireless networks, the idea of LANs and\nwhat we generally see there, and\n\n630\n00:35:47.867 --> 00:35:51.733\nalso of course, the idea here of\nconnecting out to the internet, too.\n\n631\n00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:53.433\nAnd just remember that you will see that.\n\n632\n00:35:53.433 --> 00:35:57.696\nThat the idea of all these things do kind\nof merge together, but at the same time,\n\n633\n00:35:57.696 --> 00:36:00.344\nthey do have concepts that\nwe have to understand.\n\n634\n00:36:00.344 --> 00:36:04.160\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode then.\n\n635\n00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.260\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your hose Ronnie Wong.\n\n636\n00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm West Bryan.\n\n637\n00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.878\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here, for\nmore IC3

00:00:16.770\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.950\nyou're watching the IC3\ncomputing fundamental show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.400\nAnd where we're about to take a look into\nthe realm of back ups and restoration.\n\n6\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.030\nNow, it's one of the most important things\nthat we can actually do to help us prevent\n\n7\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.230\ndata loss, so it's something we\ndefinitely need to at least touch on and\n\n8\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.920\nget a basic understanding of.\n\n9\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.400\nAnd here to help us to actually\nunderstand those details, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.590\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n11\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.880\n>> Thanks for having me Ronnie,\nas always, great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.960\nThat's right,\nwe're gonna be looking at what should be\n\n13\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100\npart of normal system maintenance now.\n\n14\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.950\nYou heard Ronnie say\npreventive maintenance,\n\n15\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.550\nwhat is it that we're trying to prevent?\n\n16\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.970\nWell, data loss, you have important, we're\ntalking about information system right.\n\n17\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.760\nAnd the information that is on those\nsystem is just crucial to us and\n\n18\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.680\nimportant to us.\n\n19\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.750\nSo one of the things we wanna make\nsure that we can do is that we can\n\n20\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.400\nprotect our system for\nwhat might be an inevitable failure.\n\n21\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.760\nDevices fail all the time, and it's\nnot a matter of if they're gonna fail,\n\n22\n00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.280\nit's just a matter of\nwhen they're gonna fail.\n\n23\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.490\nSometimes we're lucky enough, right, that\nwe don't have any problems with a machine.\n\n24\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.370\nI know I've got a little Compaq that I've\nhad jeez, I admit, seems like now it\n\n25\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.880\nmust be ten years, almost, that it's\ngoing on since I first bought it.\n\n26\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.160\nSo, have I had any problems with it?\n\n27\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.760\nWell, not as far as the data's\nconcerned but I'm lucky.\n\n28\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.260\nAnd one of the things that\nyou don't want to do is play\n\n29\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.730\na gamble with what's\nimportant in your systems.\n\n30\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.460\nNow, what is important to you?\n\n31\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.810\nThat's going to differ from\nthe next person, right?\n\n32\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.420\nSo for instance in a home environment,\nmaybe some of your documents\n\n33\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.010\nthat you have on your computer maybe,\nmaybe they are important,\n\n34\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.680\nmaybe they're not important, but maybe you\nhave things like a family pictures, right?\n\n35\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.710\nAs far as I'm concerned, there isn't\nreally a piece of software that I cannot\n\n36\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.610\nafford to lose, and just completely, don't\nworry about the drive fail, just throw\n\n37\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.910\nthe drive out and get a new one and\nreinstall the software and that's fine.\n\n38\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.790\nHowever, you know for me I can't get\nthose pictures of my family back,\n\n39\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.380\nthey're just you can't replace them.\n\n40\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.480\nSo that's what we're gonna\nbe talking about here is,\n\n41\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.760\nhow we can ensure that not only the system\ncan be restored if necessary but\n\n42\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.090\nalso the data itself can be too.\n\n43\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.220\nAll right so\n\n44\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.600\nthe first thing that we're gonna look at\nwe're gonna look at the system itself.\n\n45\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.470\nAnd this is a technology that is inside\nof Windows, it's been inside Windows for\n\n46\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.960\na while now it's called System Restore.\n\n47\n00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.430\nNow one of the things that we're gonna\nkeep in mind here is that what system\n\n48\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.070\nrestore doesn't do all right.\n\n49\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.030\nCuz remember we're looking\nat system restoration here,\n\n50\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.660\nwhat this doesn't do is\nrestore the user data.\n\n51\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.410\nSo we're gonna kind of combine\ntwo different things here.\n\n52\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.390\nWe'll talk about the data\nrestoration here coming up but\n\n53\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.960\nwe're gonna start here\nwith our system itself.\n\n54\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.570\nNow, there are a couple of happenings or\ngoing ons, if your will,\n\n55\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.370\nin your computing experience that might\ncause problems that would need you to use\n\n56\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490\nthis software known as System Restore.\n\n57\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.760\nAnd some of the common things,\nfirst of all it could be malware.\n\n58\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970\nWe always talk about malware\ncould infect a system.\n\n59\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.210\nAnd it might require you to rebuild\nthings like system files, right.\n\n60\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.920\nThe other thing too, that might happen is\ninstalling drivers that maybe the driver\n\n61\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.700\nis corrupt, this could cause\nproblems with your system.\n\n62\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.130\nMaybe for whatever reason it locks\nyou out of your machine, well,\n\n63\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.630\nthat's another thing that could happen.\n\n64\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.580\nYou can install an application, an\napplication could cause problems as well.\n\n65\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.470\nOr how about this,\nyou might even delete an application and\n\n66\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.810\nsometimes you can bring that\nback with system restore too.\n\n67\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.250\nBut the main thing we want to know about\nsystem restore is it's a way that you can\n\n68\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.560\nreturn your configuration on your\nmachine to an earlier point in time,\n\n69\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.530\nshould today be the day that things\ngo wrong with that computer.\n\n70\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.120\n>> Now Wes before we go on any further and\n\n71\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.350\nyou show us exactly what's going on here,\nlet's talk about the need for\n\n72\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.150\nsystem restore just a little bit more on\na basic side for some of our users, right?\n\n73\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.950\nThe very fact is, your computer operating\nsystem is really just software.\n\n74\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.150\nThe more often you use it,\nyou're gonna find out something and\n\n75\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.760\nwe're gonna talk about this in\nprobably a little bit of time as well.\n\n76\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.520\nIt's gonna start to change and\nit's gonna start to add files in,\n\n77\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.630\nsometimes what can end up happening,\nright?\n\n78\n00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.590\nIs that you download something and\nyou add it into your computer system, and\n\n79\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.685\nnow all the sudden, the computer doesn't\nrespond the way that you think it should.\n\n80\n00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.235\nAnd so now, you might have gone two or\n\n81\n00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:27.105\nthree days just thinking well, I'll fix\nit at some point, and you just don't.\n\n82\n00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:30.695\nAnd after a while you start realizing\nit's getting worse and worse, and\n\n83\n00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:34.715\nnow you're actually in trouble because\nyou're wondering I don't know what I did.\n\n84\n00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:36.835\nI thought I actually had removed it but\n\n85\n00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:40.250\nI didn't really remove it,\nI still see some things happening.\n\n86\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.200\nWell what can you do?\n\n87\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.460\nWell that's where System Restore helps us\nout, is in those situations in which when\n\n88\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.810\nsomebody says look, it was working fine\ntwo days ago and now it's not working.\n\n89\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.270\nThis is something you may want to try\nthat will help us to recover at least\n\n90\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.870\nthe files as they were during that day\nbefore you actually had some changes.\n\n91\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.770\nSo in the background what's going on\nthere in the System Restore, right.\n\n92\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.420\nIt is actually going to say, look, Ronnie\nyou decided to install some software.\n\n93\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.300\nBut before you do that which looks\nlike it's gonna make a major change in\n\n94\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.520\nthe operating system,\nlet me go ahead and do this.\n\n95\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.250\nLet me take a picture of the operating\nsystem files, as they are right now.\n\n96\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.215\nAnd in that way, when Ronnie you\ninstall that and it changes something,\n\n97\n00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:25.043\nyou'll be very happy that I did.\n\n98\n00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:28.479\nAnd the reason why is because\nwe can always go back to that\n\n99\n00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.187\ntime right before I\ninstalled something and\n\n100\n00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:35.301\nthat will make all those files appear\nas it were a snapshot in time.\n\n101\n00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:40.198\nSo hopefully rolling back those\nchanges the day before I actually made\n\n102\n00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:45.267\nthat change, and then, maybe getting\nrid of the problem that I caused.\n\n103\n00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:47.930\nNow Wes,\nhave you ever had to use System Restore?\n\n104\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.180\n>> Absolutely, on many occasions I've had\nto use it and it's usually because of\n\n105\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320\nthe errors that I have made not\nthe errors that others have made.\n\n106\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.170\nSo one of the things that we'll do.\n\n107\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.100\nSystem restore, we're gonna check\nfirst of all to see if it's enabled.\n\n108\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.070\nOne of the things that you need to pay\nattention to is wherever it is that you're\n\n109\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.270\ntrying to bring these configurations\nto that earlier point in time.\n\n110\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.200\nYou have to make sure that the drive\nthat associated with those files\n\n111\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.350\nthat it does have system\nrestore turned on.\n\n112\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.890\nAnd that's the basic right there is\nmaking sure that this is enabled.\n\n113\n00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.620\nLet me show what I mean here,\nwe got a Windows 7 machine and\n\n114\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.950\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive right in.\n\n115\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.580\nGet into the Start Menu, and\non this one here, the interesting thing\n\n116\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.020\nis we're gonna right click on our\ncomputer icon on the Start Menu.\n\n117\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.800\nWe're gonna drop down to\nwhat is known as Properties.\n\n118\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.330\nLet me go ahead and\nzoom in there right there, and\n\n119\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.020\nyou can see that we're\ngoing to Properties.\n\n120\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.900\nNow when we go to Properties this is\nwhat's known as the System Control Panel\n\n121\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.690\nall right?\n\n122\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.550\nAnd the System Control Panel is gonna\nbe where we can look at System Restore.\n\n123\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.770\nAnd on the left-hand side here you'll\nsee that there is this System protection\n\n124\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.540\noption, we're going to go ahead and\nwe gonna launch that.\n\n125\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.490\nNow, this launches us from the System\nControl Panel into what's known as\n\n126\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.920\nthe System Properties.\n\n127\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.570\nAnd from the System Properties you can see\n\n128\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.310\nwe have what's known as\nSystem Protection here.\n\n129\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.560\nNow, with the System Protection,\nnotice that it says, what it tells us.\n\n130\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.430\nUse the system protection to\nundo unwanted system changes and\n\n131\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.020\nrestore previous versions of files.\n\n132\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.000\nNow, the focus that we're\ngoing to be looking at is\n\n133\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000\nrestoring those unwanted system\nchanges that you've made, and\n\n134\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.900\nnow you want to go back to that earlier\npoint, that's what we're going to do.\n\n135\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.500\nLet's find out if\nSystem Restore is turned on.\n\n136\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.968\nNow with my Local Disk (C:), right?\n\n137\n00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:35.060\nLocal Disk (C:) being where all your\noperating system files are on by default.\n\n138\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.270\nNotice that it does say\nthat it is turned on.\n\n139\n00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.770\nSo that's good,\nwe know that System Restore is already on,\n\n140\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.110\nour primary hardware, our primary storage\ncontainer that we need to focus on.\n\n141\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.380\nNow, the next thing that we\nhave to do is we have to create\n\n142\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.230\nsomething that Ronnie was kind\nof alluding to here earlier.\n\n143\n00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.440\nAnd that's something\nknown as a restore point.\n\n144\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.567\nNow, that's the first thing.\n\n145\n00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:01.793\nNow there are a couple of things\nthat trigger restore points, but\n\n146\n00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:05.148\nlet's talk about what the restore\npoint is before the triggering.\n\n147\n00:08:05.148 --> 00:08:09.497\nThe restore point is a point in time\nsnapshot of the configuration of your\n\n148\n00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:15.050\ncomputer as it was the moment, well,\nyou create that checkpoint, if you will.\n\n149\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.400\nNow, what happens is as you go and make\nchanges, if you make an unwanted change,\n\n150\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.480\nif you get a virus on your computer that\nmakes changes to your operating system or\n\n151\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.940\nmaybe even install a driver\nthat causes a problem.\n\n152\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.690\nAnd you decide that you're\ngoing to go back to this\n\n153\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:33.250\npoint in time configuration\nsnapshot called the restore point.\n\n154\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.140\nWhat it supposed to do\nis undo those changes.\n\n155\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.680\nNow, I talked about triggering,\n\n156\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.570\nthere are a couple of things in here\nthat trigger these restore points.\n\n157\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.650\nIn fact, let's see here,\n\n158\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.410\nthere's a way that you can see if\nyou've already got restore points made.\n\n159\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.020\nThis is something that\nI like to make sure.\n\n160\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.380\nDon't wait til you need a restore point to\nfigure out if the restore points are being\n\n161\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.000\ncreated.\n\n162\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.940\nOtherwise, this software really\nisn't doing you any good.\n\n163\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.590\nSo if I decide that I'm gonna\ndo a system restore, right?\n\n164\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.310\nI can do the System Restore and\nwe're not actually doing the restore,\n\n165\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.080\nI'm using this to find out if I\nalready have those restore points.\n\n166\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.610\nSo notice that it says Restore\nsystem files and settings.\n\n167\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.010\nI'm gonna choose Next in this wizard.\n\n168\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.320\nAnd here we go,\nwe can see that we do have some\n\n169\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.020\nautomatically created\npoint in time snapshots.\n\n170\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.440\nAll right, now like I was saying earlier,\none of the things that triggers this,\n\n171\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.880\napplication installations,\ndriver installations, right?\n\n172\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.450\nWindows Update,\nit applies updates to a machine,\n\n173\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.110\nright before that happens\nit creates a checkpoint.\n\n174\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.990\nSo that let's say if\nWindows Update is downloaded, and\n\n175\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.540\nmaybe there's some kinda communication\nbreakdown and it corrupts the file and\n\n176\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.500\nit causes problems in your computer.\n\n177\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.530\nYou can always roll back, restore\nback to that earlier point in time.\n\n178\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.150\nSame thing goes with applications,\nwhen it comes to applications,\n\n179\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.120\nif you install an application, it becomes\nproblematic, you need to get rid of it.\n\n180\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.470\nWell, you can come in here and\nyou can use your restore point and\n\n181\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.730\nyou can restore to that\nearlier point in time.\n\n182\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.320\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel out of this wizard.\n\n183\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.500\nOne of the things I wanted to do is just\nsee if I had any restore points available\n\n184\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.330\nbefore we do the next one.\n\n185\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.990\nOkay, so if I was to install\nlet's say an application,\n\n186\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.340\nit would trigger one automatically.\n\n187\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.610\nBut I wanna show you how to\ncreate one manually as well.\n\n188\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.360\nAll right,\nnotice we have this Create button here.\n\n189\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.430\nThe Create button allows me to\nmanually define a restore point.\n\n190\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.476\nAll right and\nwhat we're gonna do we call this Demo.\n\n191\n00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:26.600\nYou can name it what you want,\n\n192\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.700\nname it as far you're naming can mention\nmake sure that it's easily identifiable.\n\n193\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.090\nMaybe, you're installing like a graphics\ncard, drivers something you might call it\n\n194\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.640\ngraphics card driver install or\ndriver install and that's up to you.\n\n195\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.510\nJust make sure that it's\neasily recognizable so\n\n196\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.940\nthat you know where to restore back to.\n\n197\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.400\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll choose Create.\n\n198\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.505\nNow in manually creating\nthat restore point,\n\n199\n00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:56.265\nIs doing the same identical thing that\nthe automatic restore point was doing.\n\n200\n00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:59.145\nNotice it says the restore\npoint was created successfully.\n\n201\n00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:01.335\nNow we're gonna do a couple of things.\n\n202\n00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:05.735\nWe're gonna do some things and we're gonna\nsee how the system restoration works for\n\n203\n00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:08.585\nus and if it works successfully.\n\n204\n00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.275\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n205\n00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:15.350\nclose these down and I'm gonna\ninstall a driver here real quick.\n\n206\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.880\nAnd I'm gonna purposely,\nif I can get to the right location,\n\n207\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.370\nI'm gonna purposely install\nthe wrong driver, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.120\nAnd we do this from Device Manager,\n\n209\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.190\nremember we were talking about some of the\ncomponents, Device Manager is where you\n\n210\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.770\nmanage your devices and\nthe drivers associated with them.\n\n211\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:36.460\nI'm gonna go in here and what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go to our keyboards.\n\n212\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.100\nActually let's see mouse, there we go\nwe'll do mouse and pointing devices.\n\n213\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.690\nAnd I've got a mouse already\na driver already in here but\n\n214\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.030\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsay update driver software.\n\n215\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.460\nAnd I'm gonna browse my computer for\n\n216\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.160\na list of drivers that Microsoft already\nhas baked into the operating system.\n\n217\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.780\nAnd notice this check mark\nsays show compatible hardware,\n\n218\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.640\nI'm gonna uncheck this.\n\n219\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.130\nAll right, now I'll just grab one\nof these, any one here that is not,\n\n220\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.720\nit isn't for this device so\nit might cause problems.\n\n221\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.120\nNotice that it's telling me that\ninstalling these drivers not recommended.\n\n222\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.990\nWe're gonna go ahead and say Yes, so\n\n223\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.750\nwe're creating the scenario in which maybe\na network transmission you've downloaded\n\n224\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.200\nthat drivers that's got corrupted even if\nit is the right driver we'll choose close.\n\n225\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.830\nAnd what its gonna do is\nit's gonna say alright,\n\n226\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.640\nyou're gonna restart your computer so\nthis is part of it.\n\n227\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.380\nNow as this computer\nrestarts what have we done.\n\n228\n00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.450\nWe've done a driver installation and\n\n229\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.570\nit really wouldn't be any different if\nyou were to pull a third party's piece of\n\n230\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.710\nsoftware off the manufacturer's website\nand decide that you're gonna install it.\n\n231\n00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.655\nWe're hoping that according to just normal\nfunctionality and a lot of times you don't\n\n232\n00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:46.155\nhave to worry about this but\nit might be sometimes you do.\n\n233\n00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:49.765\nNormally your driver installations today,\nthey're really easy.\n\n234\n00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:52.645\nA lot of times they got an executable but\nthe manufacturer.\n\n235\n00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:56.875\nRemember the executables and application\nthat installs that software for us and\n\n236\n00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:57.945\nwe don't need to worry about it.\n\n237\n00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:01.045\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll dive back in here.\n\n238\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.760\nAll right that's one\nthing that I wanna do.\n\n239\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.910\nThe next thing that I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n240\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.830\nI'm gonna install some software as well.\n\n241\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.500\nSo let's go ahead and\nbring a piece of software over here and\n\n242\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.475\nwe are going to just walk through\nthe installation wizard on this and\n\n243\n00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:19.155\ngo ahead and install a piece of software.\n\n244\n00:13:19.155 --> 00:13:24.115\nNow, imagine again, in setting up\nthis scenario, you can do both.\n\n245\n00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:26.965\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncombine two in this demonstration so\n\n246\n00:13:26.965 --> 00:13:31.095\nyou can see how it works with the software\nas well as system configuration.\n\n247\n00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:33.095\nYou'll say, well Wes,\nyou didn't configure the system.\n\n248\n00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:35.637\nWell, technically I did when\nI installed a new driver.\n\n249\n00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:38.760\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe will just do the Next, Next,\n\n250\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.020\nNext, we'll accept the evil A there,\nthat license agreement.\n\n251\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.620\nWe will test Ronnie on it in\nthe end of the episode here if\n\n252\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.720\nhe read all the information there.\n\n253\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720\nJust kidding, we won't do that.\n\n254\n00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.190\nAnd, again we will just go ahead.\n\n255\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.820\nThere is our user account control,\nletting me know hey you\n\n256\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.330\nare about to install something,\ndo you want to continue?\n\n257\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.350\nWe'll go ahead and finish.\n\n258\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.160\nAnd wow, look at that,\n\n259\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.330\nwe have got on our desktop now, we've\ngot a new application that's installed.\n\n260\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.240\nI'm gonna go back to our Device Manager.\n\n261\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.030\nAnd there's a reason I'm doing this,\nI want to look and\n\n262\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.950\nsee what we might be\nseeing if a driver fails.\n\n263\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.750\nAll right, now the first thing I notice is\nthat right under the mouse and pointing\n\n264\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.740\ndevices that we changed the driver notice\nthere's a little exclamation point.\n\n265\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.080\nIf I double-click on that, notice that\nit tells me that the device can't start.\n\n266\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.040\nSo basically we have a problem right,\nthat we need to solve.\n\n267\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.070\nThere's you could uninstall the driver,\nyou could reinstall it.\n\n268\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.270\nBut again for the purposes of system\nrestore demonstration, that would take us\n\n269\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.950\noff on to another journey and\nthat's not the journey we wanna be on.\n\n270\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.375\nSo now I've got a problem,\nnow I need to restore my computer,\n\n271\n00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:42.590\nwell with System Restore.\n\n272\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.320\nRemember, like Ronnie said that point and\ntime, checkpoints,\n\n273\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.775\nsnapshot of the configuration is should be\nthere for us and were crossed our fingers.\n\n274\n00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:54.055\nWe will hope that that will actually\ntake us back to that point in time.\n\n275\n00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:56.955\nWe are going to drive 88.5 miles\nan hour in our DeLorean here.\n\n276\n00:14:56.955 --> 00:14:59.262\nSo we will go ahead and push Start,\n\n277\n00:14:59.262 --> 00:15:03.891\nwe will right-click on the Computer\nhere choose Properties again.\n\n278\n00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.528\nAnd then we're gonna go into\nSystem Protection on the left-hand side of\n\n279\n00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:09.566\nthe task link, third down from the top.\n\n280\n00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:13.125\nAnd now like I checked\nthe restore points earlier,\n\n281\n00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:16.862\nnow I'm going to actually\nuse those restore points.\n\n282\n00:15:16.862 --> 00:15:20.652\nAnd that's why I say don't wait to\nfind out if System Restore is making\n\n283\n00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:21.712\nrestore points.\n\n284\n00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.792\nBecause you never want to wait\nuntil you need them to find out you\n\n285\n00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:30.290\ndidn't configure System Restore to ensure\nthat those restore points are there.\n\n286\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.990\nNow I will tell you,\nWindows is fairly smart, and\n\n287\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.570\nit's own operations, it's brilliant.\n\n288\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:41.410\nIt knows which restore point to\ncheck that you should pick but\n\n289\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.030\nwell that wouldn't be easy, right?\n\n290\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.820\nWe wanna actually see\nthis stuff in action.\n\n291\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.006\nSo I'm gonna kinda do this\na little different way,\n\n292\n00:15:49.006 --> 00:15:51.609\nI would recommend exactly what they say.\n\n293\n00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:55.808\nMicrosoft, or no, Windows is built where\nit knows when a driver was installed,\n\n294\n00:15:55.808 --> 00:15:58.174\nit knows when an application\nwas installed.\n\n295\n00:15:58.174 --> 00:16:02.741\nSo if you're going to System Restore\nright after you've done things like that,\n\n296\n00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:07.443\noperations or actions like that it knows\nthat's probably where you want to restore\n\n297\n00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:09.811\nback to, prior to that event happening.\n\n298\n00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:12.834\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsay choose different, all right.\n\n299\n00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:13.724\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n300\n00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:16.820\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.074\nNotice here, remember what I told you,\nautomatically installed through software\n\n302\n00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:26.744\napplication installations,\nnotice that it automatically created one.\n\n303\n00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:28.682\nI am still going to chose demo,\n\n304\n00:16:28.682 --> 00:16:32.860\nbecause even though it created one\non the installation of the app,\n\n305\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.530\nit did not create one in\nthe driver installation, right?\n\n306\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.482\nAnd I have a problem now.\n\n307\n00:16:37.482 --> 00:16:40.331\nSo that's not going to help\nme as far as the driver goes.\n\n308\n00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:43.295\nAnd that is why I wanted to kind\nof compound these together so\n\n309\n00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:46.914\nyou can see that not all restore points\nare really going to be adequate for\n\n310\n00:16:46.914 --> 00:16:49.246\nthe recovery that you're\ntrying to perform.\n\n311\n00:16:49.246 --> 00:16:52.920\nAnd we'll choose Next and\nwe'll choose Finish.\n\n312\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.640\nNow just like it says here on\nthe screen you gotta be careful.\n\n313\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.910\nI'm gonna go ahead and click yes to\nthat so we can get this started.\n\n314\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.000\nAnd what that was saying?\n\n315\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.173\nIt was saying once you start\nthe system restoration,\n\n316\n00:17:02.173 --> 00:17:04.369\nthat's actually pretty fast here.\n\n317\n00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:05.940\nI don't expect it to be that fast.\n\n318\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.020\nYeah, we're gonna have to\nwait here just for a second.\n\n319\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.570\nSo what it is saying is that.\n\n320\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.620\nKind of like an update\n\n321\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.650\nthat's actually installing inside\nof your operating system, right?\n\n322\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.260\nWe don't wanna interrupt this,\n\n323\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.510\nwe don't want to lose power in\nthe middle of the system restoration.\n\n324\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.110\nOr the restoration process\nitself gets corrupted, right?\n\n325\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.250\nAnd now we really have\na bad day at the office and\n\n326\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:33.280\nwe gotta try to figure out if we can\nreinitiate that restore process.\n\n327\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.300\nSo, that would be kind of a gamble.\n\n328\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.340\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe'll get logged back in here.\n\n329\n00:17:38.962 --> 00:17:41.120\nAll right, and\nwait to get back to the desktop.\n\n330\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.614\nThe first thing I notice right away and\nRonnie I know caught it right away there\n\n331\n00:17:44.614 --> 00:17:46.615\nis the application is\ngone off the desktop.\n\n332\n00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:47.784\nIt's the first thing I can see, right?\n\n333\n00:17:47.784 --> 00:17:50.700\nNotice what it's telling me here.\n\n334\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.180\nThe restore is completely successful.\n\n335\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.050\nAll right.\n\n336\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.815\nIt tells me that it's been restored and\nit's been restored at the date,\n\n337\n00:17:57.815 --> 00:17:59.866\nhence the restore point that I picked.\n\n338\n00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:02.820\nAll right, your documents, and\nhere's the big thing guys.\n\n339\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.480\nThat's why I've got to show you\nanother type of backup because\n\n340\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.430\nthis has nothing to your documents.\n\n341\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.164\nYour documents stay where they are.\n\n342\n00:18:11.164 --> 00:18:11.710\nAll right?\n\n343\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.766\nThat's why you need other technologies\nto backup your personal information.\n\n344\n00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:17.279\nSo we'll go ahead and choose close.\n\n345\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.530\nAnd let's go ahead.\n\n346\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.690\nWe'll go back to device manager and we'll\nsee if we still got those warnings and\n\n347\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.800\nthe I took you to the wrong place here,\nlet's try that again.\n\n348\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.500\nGo back to the mouse there and\nfind out if we got any warnings here.\n\n349\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.430\nAnd when I choose device manager one of\nthe first things you're gonna notice here\n\n350\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.910\nis that well my mice and\nother pointing devices isn't expanded.\n\n351\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.240\nRight, anytime you have a problem with\na device, whatever the category it is, it\n\n352\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.593\nautomatically expands and puts a warning\nsign, some kind of warning flag there.\n\n353\n00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.830\nThere's a few different kinds, but\nwe can see that that's not the case here.\n\n354\n00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.720\nAnd you'll notice that I don't\nhave that weird driver installed.\n\n355\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.850\nNow I have the one that\nwas installed beforehand.\n\n356\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.380\nSo Ronnie, very cool way, very easy way.\n\n357\n00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.849\nIf you know just a couple of steps how we\ncan uninstall a problematic application,\n\n358\n00:19:04.849 --> 00:19:07.439\nreturning it to that\nearlier point in time, and\n\n359\n00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.644\nthe same thing that we've seen\nwith the driver, as well.\n\n360\n00:19:10.644 --> 00:19:12.376\nIf that driver becomes problematic,\n\n361\n00:19:12.376 --> 00:19:16.290\nyou can use your restore point to\nrestore it to an earlier point in time.\n\n362\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.990\n>> It really is a great feature built\ninto the Windows operating system itself.\n\n363\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.440\nThat allows us to get out of\ntrouble relatively quickly.\n\n364\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.475\nSo remember what West just showed us here,\nthe ability to manually create one, or\n\n365\n00:19:28.475 --> 00:19:30.824\nthe automatic things\nthat trigger one as well.\n\n366\n00:19:30.824 --> 00:19:35.053\nYou maybe wondering, when would I ever\nreally choose to manually create one?\n\n367\n00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:39.410\nWell if you know that you're going to be\nmaking big changes to the computer system\n\n368\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.638\nor a setting and you're not sure what\nthe effect of that setting is going to be,\n\n369\n00:19:43.638 --> 00:19:48.010\nyou might want to go ahead and\nrun that idea, that system restore point.\n\n370\n00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:53.070\nThat way if you do happen to now notice\nthat the system is not responding and\n\n371\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.420\nyou can't remember\nexactly what you changed.\n\n372\n00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.050\nWell this gives you that ability then\nright before you made the change and\n\n373\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.060\nyou go ahead and you name it, and you name\nit something that's fairly descriptive\n\n374\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.510\nlike, before major change\nto computer system.\n\n375\n00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.530\nAnd that way you'll know,\nyou can launch the operating system again,\n\n376\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.730\nchoose that restore point and\nnow everything will be brought back to\n\n377\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.780\nthat point in time,\nas far as the system's files go.\n\n378\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.950\nNow, we also need to talk then about\nthe idea of backup and the idea of\n\n379\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.770\nrestoration of our data files as well and\nWes is gonna help us out with that too.\n\n380\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.730\n>> Definitely, there's a component\nthat's inside of your Windows 7\n\n381\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.750\nmachines called backup and restore.\n\n382\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.450\nNow, I want you to understand\nsomething that with backups\n\n383\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.390\nyou do have a choice in\nwhat you can backup.\n\n384\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.990\nIf you can backup kinda like restore like\nour restore point did, you can back up\n\n385\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.570\nentire system configuration, you can\nalso back up if you want, user data.\n\n386\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.170\nBut the first thing I want to talk about\nare the types of backups that we have just\n\n387\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.295\nto kind of make you aware of them so you\nknow what they are actually doing here.\n\n388\n00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:59.365\nSo, one of the things that I,\nlet me see if I can find it here.\n\n389\n00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:02.325\nOne of the things that I have,\nI have got a diagram that I brought up and\n\n390\n00:21:02.325 --> 00:21:04.985\nlet's talk a little bit about those\nbackups and let's look at this diagram.\n\n391\n00:21:04.985 --> 00:21:08.265\nSo, backup types,\nwe have a few different backup types.\n\n392\n00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:11.025\nI see my head is kind of\ncovering this up here.\n\n393\n00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:13.635\nWe have what is known\nas a full backup type.\n\n394\n00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:18.340\nAnd understand that what that\nmeans is we are going to backup\n\n395\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.640\nevery single bit of your\nentire operating system and\n\n396\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.730\ndata on a day by day basis,\neverything gets backed up.\n\n397\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.230\nNow you might say well wait Wes, so\n\n398\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:33.430\nif Monday you have a file on your\nmachine and you backup your machine and\n\n399\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.320\nthat file stays the same are you\nstill gonna back it up on Friday?\n\n400\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.420\nAnd the answer is yes, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.200\nUnderstand that when you back up data, we\ntalked in another episode we talked about\n\n402\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.200\nattributes, there's archive attribute,\nright?\n\n403\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.960\nAnd what it is it's just let the Windows\nsub system know that hey, if you see that\n\n404\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.420\narchive attribute that means you need to\ninclude this file in the back up, right?\n\n405\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.710\nIt means you don't have\na back up of this file.\n\n406\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.850\nWhat with full back ups, it doesn't\neven care about these archive bits.\n\n407\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.730\nIt says, you know what,\n\n408\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.590\nI'm gonna make a back up even\nif I already have a copy of it.\n\n409\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:10.540\nSo you can see every single day\nwe're backing up the entire machine.\n\n410\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.311\nNow there's a benefit to this and\nthat comes down to restoration, right.\n\n411\n00:22:13.311 --> 00:22:15.299\nNow first part of it is that\nthe backup could take a while, right,\n\n412\n00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:16.326\nyou're backing up everything.\n\n413\n00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:20.770\nBut then the restoration that you do,\nright?\n\n414\n00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:25.630\nIs a little bit easier cuz I can take\nanyone of these days prior to you know\n\n415\n00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.000\na failure and I can just choose that\none media that we've backed up to and\n\n416\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.670\nthat could be the back-up set and\n\n417\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.410\nI'll talk about that coming up that\nwe used to restore the machine.\n\n418\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.310\nThen there's another type of backup, and\n\n419\n00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.240\nthis backup is what's known\nas a differential backup.\n\n420\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.940\nNow the differential backup is a little\nbit different in the fact, let's see if I\n\n421\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.550\ncan get that in the screen there,\nis a little bit different in the fact that\n\n422\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.470\nthis one has to start with a week\nprior to that full backup, all right?\n\n423\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.950\nUnderstand that you have to have all\nthe data prior from the prior week,\n\n424\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.780\nin order to start backing up the new week.\n\n425\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.970\nBut the major difference between\nthe full backup and this differential,\n\n426\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.910\nyou'll notice that the backups\nare starting to slowly increase in size.\n\n427\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.140\nWell why is that?\n\n428\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.866\nThat's because on Monday,\nif I make changes to documents, right,\n\n429\n00:23:12.866 --> 00:23:14.890\nthey're gonna have those\narchived bits present.\n\n430\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.550\nThat means the backup subsystem\ngoes all of these files?\n\n431\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.820\nI need to back up.\n\n432\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.710\nI'm just backing up the changes, though.\n\n433\n00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.765\nAnd it's a little bit different.\n\n434\n00:23:23.765 --> 00:23:25.060\nWe're not backing up everything.\n\n435\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.120\nIt says well I have got a full backup so\nlet me look on Monday and\n\n436\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.060\njust see what's changed.\n\n437\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.300\nThen when Tuesday comes in we're\ngonna make some changes as well.\n\n438\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.850\nBut then when we run the backup system\nit's also gonna see those changes that\n\n439\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.050\nhappened back on Monday as well.\n\n440\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.060\nSo that it is gonna\nback up those likewise.\n\n441\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.230\nAnd then so on and so forth.\n\n442\n00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.640\nOn Wednesday we're gonna make our new,\nunique changes that\n\n443\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.220\nweren't there on Tuesday and weren't\nthere on Monday, the red disk here.\n\n444\n00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.523\nBut then it sees all of the changes\nthat have been made for\n\n445\n00:23:59.523 --> 00:24:02.557\nthe past two days and it includes that.\n\n446\n00:24:02.557 --> 00:24:07.703\nAnd then it does it for Thursday, and by\nFriday, we've got a pretty large backup.\n\n447\n00:24:07.703 --> 00:24:10.707\nNow what is the benefit and\ndrawbacks to this one?\n\n448\n00:24:10.707 --> 00:24:14.089\nWell, let's talk about the drawback first.\n\n449\n00:24:14.089 --> 00:24:16.950\nThe drawback is that the backup set.\n\n450\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.920\nAnd again I'm gonna tell you\nwhat the backup set means.\n\n451\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.700\nThe data that you need to restore\ngets larger and larger and\n\n452\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.730\nlarger as you go through the week.\n\n453\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:28.060\nThe benefit to that over\nthe full backup is that it's not\n\n454\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.010\nquite as full as a full backup,\nso it doesn't take quite as long.\n\n455\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.940\nNow, one of the great, one of the other\ndrawbacks I would say to that is the fact\n\n456\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.970\nthat when you restore, all right,\nwhen you do your restoration.\n\n457\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.720\nYou need this full backup\nbecause that contains all\n\n458\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.220\nof the data that you had the prior week.\n\n459\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.030\nAnd then let's say if\nit fails on Thursday,\n\n460\n00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:55.230\nI need that full backup, and I also\nneed the backup set for the prior day.\n\n461\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:00.640\nAnd then when I do my\nrestoration those two components\n\n462\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.670\nthe two different amounts of information\nmake up a total restoration.\n\n463\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.170\nBut again this backup doesn't take quite\nas long as the full backup to do, but\n\n464\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.589\nit does start to progressively get larger.\n\n465\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:18.211\nThe last one we'll talk about is\ncalled the incremental back-up, and\n\n466\n00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:21.440\nthe incremental back-up,\nif I could say that right,\n\n467\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.030\ndoes something a little bit\ndifferent than the differential.\n\n468\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.910\nIt says I only care about\nwhat has changed today, and\n\n469\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.430\nthat's all I am going to back up.\n\n470\n00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.840\nI am gonna look at the full backup, right?\n\n471\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.510\nI am gonna see, well on Monday we're\nmaking some unique files, unique changes,\n\n472\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.020\nI'll back that up.\n\n473\n00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.280\nBut then on Tuesday, I don't care\nabout what happened on Monday,\n\n474\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.540\nI just wanna know what happened on Tuesday\nand I'm gonna back that data up, and\n\n475\n00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.120\nthen likewise Wednesday,\nThursday and Friday.\n\n476\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.780\nNotice it doesn't care about the prior\ndays and the backups stays small,\n\n477\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.700\nthat's the benefit to it.\n\n478\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.210\nIt doesn't take too long\nto backup your data.\n\n479\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.010\nThe drawback is let's say that\nsame analogy that on Thursday,\n\n480\n00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.720\nI lose my machine.\n\n481\n00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.000\nI come in on Thursday and\neverything's gone.\n\n482\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.980\nRight, with a full backup I just need the\ntape from Wednesday I just need the backup\n\n483\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.730\nset from Wednesday and I'm good.\n\n484\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:15.360\nIf its differential I need the full\nbackup and Wednesday, unfortunately\n\n485\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.940\non the incremental backup because they\nare incremental I need Wednesday,\n\n486\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.580\nI need Tuesday, I need Monday and\nI need that full backup.\n\n487\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.160\nAnd you can see by putting\nall of those together,\n\n488\n00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.460\nthat ends up being the full\nrestoration that's needed.\n\n489\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.980\nSo the backup process\ntakes a little bit longer.\n\n490\n00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.330\nNow that being said I've\ntalked about a backup set low.\n\n491\n00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.540\nWhat do you say Ronnie we\nactually see this in action,\n\n492\n00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.900\nno more theory let's jump in and\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n493\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.530\nI'm gonna drop back down to control panel,\nremember that's through the start menu.\n\n494\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.160\nWe'll bring up the control panel.\n\n495\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.990\nWe're gonna go to system and security,\n\n496\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.980\nand right down here is back up and\nrestore right.\n\n497\n00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.625\nWe're going to use that utility.\n\n498\n00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:01.245\nNow the first thing you You have to do\nis what's known as backup scheduling.\n\n499\n00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:05.685\nI can't do a backup if I don't\nfirst turn the software on and\n\n500\n00:27:05.685 --> 00:27:10.765\nsay at this date at this time,\nI'm gonna perform a backup.\n\n501\n00:27:10.765 --> 00:27:12.230\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n502\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.780\nWe're gonna set our backup and\nit's gonna start the Windows backup,\n\n503\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.260\nbut it's not actually running\nthe backup process yet.\n\n504\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.390\nIt's saying okay, well,\nwhat do you want to back up, all right?\n\n505\n00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.450\nNow what we have to do\n\n506\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:31.080\nis we have to ensure that the disk\nthat we have has enough space on it.\n\n507\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.070\nAnd I can tell you that if I\ntry to back up on this drive,\n\n508\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.980\nwell guess what it's not gonna allow\nme to do that, it says only four Gigs.\n\n509\n00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.670\nSo let's go ahead and real quick,\nlet me change that and\n\n510\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.630\nmake it big enough as that I can use that.\n\n511\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.600\nSo should have hand that,\nshould have thought about that before, but\n\n512\n00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.080\nwe can go ahead and\nwe can change that real quick.\n\n513\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.270\nSo let me make that volume\ncapable to be backed up to\n\n514\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.680\nand we will,\nlet's start that process one more time,\n\n515\n00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.120\nand we should see that\nwe have enough space.\n\n516\n00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.530\nNotice that it says recommended.\n\n517\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.800\nWhy did it change from not allowing me to,\nto recommended?\n\n518\n00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.340\nWherever you back up to you have to have\nenough space to fit the information in\n\n519\n00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.800\nthere, so we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n520\n00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.642\nWe'll choose next.\n\n521\n00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:25.330\nAnd again, you can let Windows\nchoose what it needs to back up, and\n\n522\n00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.900\nit'll know what it needs to do, but we're\ngonna go ahead and say just let me choose.\n\n523\n00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.680\nWe'll choose next, and here are all the\ndifferent locations that you can back up.\n\n524\n00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.840\nYou can also include\na complete system image,\n\n525\n00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.540\nwhich is just a full snapshot of your hard\ndrive right now, we're not gonna do that.\n\n526\n00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and uncheck this.\n\n527\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:43.900\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n528\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.330\nuncheck all these other files just to\nmake it a little bit faster here for us.\n\n529\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.405\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\nmake sure that it backs up my documents.\n\n530\n00:28:53.405 --> 00:28:56.780\nNow that being said what\ndocuments do I have to backup?\n\n531\n00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.990\nLet's go ahead and create a document\nreally quick, and we'll call this test.\n\n532\n00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:06.500\nAnd we are gonna go ahead and we are gonna\nput another test file really quick\n\n533\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:12.640\ninside of our Documents location, and\nwe'll call this test2, and let's go ahead.\n\n534\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.160\nNow that we set the schedule.\n\n535\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.580\nNotice that it tells me,\nwhat is backed up?\n\n536\n00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.210\nAnd if I needed to change the schedule,\nI could.\n\n537\n00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.550\nNotice that by default,\nthis is what we have.\n\n538\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.200\nAll right, I'm not gonna change it,\nbut it is part of,\n\n539\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.260\nif you are gonna head do the scheduling.\n\n540\n00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.580\nYou should know how to modify the schedule\nif the default doesn't work for you.\n\n541\n00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.380\nNow you can see that the backup\nis in process right here.\n\n542\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.330\nAnd we will go ahead, notice we\ncould view the details if we want,\n\n543\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.630\nit says creating a shadow copy and\nthat really didn't take too long.\n\n544\n00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.330\nSo it looks like the backup has\nHappened like we want it to.\n\n545\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.010\nSo Ronnie what do you say\nwe simulate an error here?\n\n546\n00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:56.980\nWe'll go ahead, we'll delete this file,\nand I'll delete it from the,\n\n547\n00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.970\nlet me select the right thing here so\nI get the appropriate right-click options.\n\n548\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.839\nWe'll go into our folder here,\nDocuments folder that we just used.\n\n549\n00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.680\nThere's our test file, and\nwe're gonna go ahead and delete this, and\n\n550\n00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.660\nwe'll make sure that it isn't any smoke\nand mirrors here, you know there's nothing\n\n551\n00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.870\nup my sleeves like you can probably\nsee that, because it's short sleeves.\n\n552\n00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.030\nAll right, now we've got a failure.\n\n553\n00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.330\nI need to get this data\nback how do I do it.\n\n554\n00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:29.440\nWell here's how we perform the restoration\nlet's go ahead and show you guys that.\n\n555\n00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.790\nAll right, so we're gonna go back\nto Control Panel > System and\n\n556\n00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.150\nSecurity, back to Backup and Restore,\n\n557\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.750\nI know that's a little redundant there,\nand notice this Restore My Files.\n\n558\n00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.450\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna say Restore My Files and\n\n559\n00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.980\nit gives me the option to search for\nindividual files.\n\n560\n00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.530\nIf you happen to know what the file is\nit's in what's known as the backup set.\n\n561\n00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.900\nNow, I mentioned a backup set earlier but\nI would take a second here real quick and\n\n562\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.270\nshow you what I mean.\n\n563\n00:30:55.270 --> 00:31:00.900\nIf I dropdown the Windows Explorer and\nI go to the location, in which I stored\n\n564\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.520\nthat backup information, notice I have\na file here, that's what a backup set is.\n\n565\n00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.940\nA backup set is the data that you are\nkeeping on hand in case of a failure so\n\n566\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.270\nthat you can restore.\n\n567\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.030\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nlet's let this Wizard.\n\n568\n00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.670\nWe'll browse for folders, make sure\nthat I said, I said, browse for files.\n\n569\n00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.590\nHow about we browse for folders.\n\n570\n00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.290\nI'll select the backup of the C drive\nthat we just created, I'll choose,\n\n571\n00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:30.370\nadd the folder, as you can see here, we'll\nchoose, next, and it asks me if I wanna\n\n572\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.400\nback it up to a different location,\nor to the original location?\n\n573\n00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.330\nWe'll go ahead and keep the original\nlocation, and we're gonna perform\n\n574\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:40.760\nthe restore, and it's telling me,\ndo you wanna copy and replace these files?\n\n575\n00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.600\nI'm just gonna go ahead and say,\nI want to copy and replace.\n\n576\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.548\nThere is one file that it can't do, and\nI'll tell you what this error is about.\n\n577\n00:31:48.548 --> 00:31:52.120\nThat's the desktop.ini file,\ncuz it's also backing up that, and\n\n578\n00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.720\nthat's a configuration file, and\nit's saying hey there's a conflict there.\n\n579\n00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.652\nI'm not worried about that file cuz I\nalready have one on the desktop, and\n\n580\n00:31:59.652 --> 00:32:00.930\nwe'll choose Finish.\n\n581\n00:32:03.142 --> 00:32:10.140\nAnd I'm gonna go to my Documents folder\nand sure enough there is my test document.\n\n582\n00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.420\nNow, one of the reasons I\nleft out the desktop is,\n\n583\n00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.640\nto show you the fact that you have to\nchoose the right locations, right?\n\n584\n00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.940\nAll I chose, in the backup, was documents.\n\n585\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.060\nI didn't choose the desktop.\n\n586\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.030\nSo, you notice what isn't on my desktop,\nmy file.\n\n587\n00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.780\nSo, that's just an example of making sure,\nthat, when you do the restoration,\n\n588\n00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:36.540\nthat you've selected the right locations\nin your backup scheduling to begin with.\n\n589\n00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.350\nBecause you don't wanna wait until you\nneed a backup to make sure that you've got\n\n590\n00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.150\nthese configurations right.\n\n591\n00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.800\nWhy?\n\n592\n00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.670\nBecause exactly what happened there.\n\n593\n00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:49.230\nNotice I do have what I included,\ntest two is there, but what I don't have\n\n594\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:53.240\nis a misconfiguration of the settings,\nand that's the one on the Desktop.\n\n595\n00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.170\nBackup and restoration, not too hard\nas long as you know what to do,\n\n596\n00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.450\njust make sure that you perform\nbackups and you test them.\n\n597\n00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.080\nDon't wait till you need them in order\nto figure out if they worked or not.\n\n598\n00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:09.250\n>> When you're a regular computer\nuser on a daily basis at a business,\n\n599\n00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.110\nyou might not be asked to backup at all.\n\n600\n00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.200\nSo don't assume that you have to do any\nof this that we've just showed you.\n\n601\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.980\nBut in a home environment,\n\n602\n00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.840\nespecially if you do have data that you\nwant to ensure that's going to be kept,\n\n603\n00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.720\nyou need to make sure you have\na plan to backup your system.\n\n604\n00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.160\nAnd even though we showed you the way\nthat's included inside of Windows 7\n\n605\n00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.930\nitself, there are utilities out there\nthat will do the same thing for\n\n606\n00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.450\nyou that Wes has shown you.\n\n607\n00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.540\nFor example the other day I ended up\nwith a nice little USB hard drive,\n\n608\n00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.540\nand when I plugged it directly into my\ncomputer it asked me if I wanted to\n\n609\n00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.280\ngo ahead and make a backup of\nthe entire computing system right then.\n\n610\n00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.780\nAnd all I had to do was\nfollow the menu system along.\n\n611\n00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.670\nWell that's another example of a backup\nthat you can have, that allows for\n\n612\n00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.410\nif something were to happen on\nthe following day after I backed it up,\n\n613\n00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.200\nI should be able to just plug that device\nin there, and rerun that software,\n\n614\n00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.660\nand follow the instructions for\nthe restoration.\n\n615\n00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.210\nWes showed us the manual process for\nbeing able to inside of Windows, so\n\n616\n00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.680\njust kind of understand that\nthere are those things available\n\n617\n00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.380\nto help ensure we won't lose the data.\n\n618\n00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.230\nAlso when we take a look at the idea of\nsystem restore, well not both of these,\n\n619\n00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.160\nmight not be something that you'll ever do\ninside of that workplace environment, but\n\n620\n00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.010\nit could be that they\nasked you to do that,\n\n621\n00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.500\nso you need at least know where some\nof this is gonna be located as well.\n\n622\n00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.010\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode as well.\n\n623\n00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.310\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n624\n00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.230\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n625\n00:34:35.230 -->

00:00:17.282\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:20.062\nyou're watching\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:24.274\nWhere we are about to take a look at\nwhat the realm of cloud computing.\n\n6\n00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:29.147\nNow we've really been sticking to\nthe desktop environment talking about\n\n7\n00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:33.800\nthe PC itself, the system unit and\nreally a microcosm of itself.\n\n8\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.210\nBut now when we start getting into the\nrealm of computing it extends beyond us.\n\n9\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.390\nAnd we are now going to float into\nthe clouds with Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.860\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.330\n>> Thanks man, I mean who better to have\ntheir head in the clouds for you than me.\n\n12\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.051\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:49.325\n>> Everybody knows my\nhead is in the clouds.\n\n14\n00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:50.498\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n15\n00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:54.020\nSo we're gonna look at some of the\nconcepts here that we need to understand.\n\n16\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.440\nAgain, keep in mind there are many\ndifferent cloud technologies there, and\n\n17\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.170\nthey can go many different ways.\n\n18\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.040\nGuys, we're barely gonna\nscratch the surface.\n\n19\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.240\nThis can get to be a very complex topic,\n\n20\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.730\nbut what we're gonna try to do is make\nit a little bit more simple for you.\n\n21\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.600\nAnd kind of break down some of\nthe different components that you see, and\n\n22\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.490\narchitecture that you would see inside\nof a cloud computing type environment.\n\n23\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.710\nSo what are we talking about\nwhen we say the cloud?\n\n24\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.780\nAll right, well when we talk about\nthe cloud we're talking about,\n\n25\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.800\nRonnie kind of hinted on it.\n\n26\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.928\nWe've been talking about just the desktop,\n\n27\n00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:26.356\neverything that's locally on my\nmachine that's stored on my machine.\n\n28\n00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:29.581\nWell, when we talk about the cloud\nwe're talking about, essentially,\n\n29\n00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.255\nout there on the Internet somewhere.\n\n30\n00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:36.085\nSomebody else has a network with all of\nthis hardware, and all of these resources,\n\n31\n00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:38.820\nand a bunch of memory, big old computers.\n\n32\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.710\nAnd what they're gonna do is,\n\n33\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.570\nthey're gonna let you use\na portion of their network\n\n34\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.660\nin order to get certain functionality,\nand in order to support your environment.\n\n35\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.790\n>> Now Wes, let's talk about the reason\nwhy this is such an important topic today.\n\n36\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.210\nMost of us, if we've just started\nworking with computing system.\n\n37\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.400\nIt really is getting the challenge\nof understanding and\n\n38\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.940\nworking with applications,\nand keyboards, and mice.\n\n39\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.810\nAnd just even\n\n40\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.860\nsome of the basic things that we have\nto know about the computer is enough.\n\n41\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.820\nBut this idea of cloud computing\nseems a little bit more foreign.\n\n42\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.220\nBut why is it so important if all\nI'm doing is working with this?\n\n43\n00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.340\n>> That's right, well let's look\nat the support model, right?\n\n44\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.650\nLet's just start with support, right.\n\n45\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.680\nIf we have an application and\n\n46\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.560\nthat application is something that we're\ngonna install on our computers, right?\n\n47\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360\nRonnie or myself, we would have to go to\nthe computer, we'd have to install that\n\n48\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.190\nsoftware, and maybe go to another\ncomputer and install that software.\n\n49\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.030\nAnd even if you had a process that would\nallow you to install this software,\n\n50\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.320\nlet's say many times, in many different\nlocations, many computers at once.\n\n51\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.110\nWhen you look at the support model\nbehind just typical computing.\n\n52\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.920\nThat means if somebody has a problem,\nif the application gets corrupted,\n\n53\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.710\nI have to go to a computer,\nto computer, to computer basis.\n\n54\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.640\nIn order to manage it, and\nhelp support the end users.\n\n55\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.250\nThe other thing that we have to do,\nis we have to acquire the software,\n\n56\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.440\nand before we can even install it, right.\n\n57\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.850\nWe have to acquire that software,\n\n58\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.570\nthen we gotta figure out how it is that\nwe're gonna get it on the computer.\n\n59\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.310\nThe other thing that we gotta\nkeep in mind as well is that,\n\n60\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.040\nthat support model,\nit costs more money, right?\n\n61\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.822\nIt costs money, you're gonna\nhave to have more man hours in\n\n62\n00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:21.756\norder to support\nthe infrastructure behind it.\n\n63\n00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.644\nOne of the great things about the cloud,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.413\none of the reasons back to what\nRonnie's initial question was.\n\n65\n00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:29.198\nWhy is it so becoming more and\nmore important today?\n\n66\n00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:33.389\nIs because we can take some of\nthat headache of the management of\n\n67\n00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.185\nthese applications and\nwe can let somebody else do this,\n\n68\n00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:40.850\nas long as we meet\na couple of prerequisites.\n\n69\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.080\n>> So let's talk about those,\n\n70\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.820\nthat idea of what you mean by\nletting somebody else do it.\n\n71\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.370\nA lot of times when we start to\nthink about the idea here of\n\n72\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.400\nwhat's on our machines.\n\n73\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.058\nRemember where your limitation\nis on that machine.\n\n74\n00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:57.630\nSo what Wes' example of, of taking just\na piece of software and installing it.\n\n75\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.490\nLet's say it's a very expensive piece of\nsoftware that you install on this machine\n\n76\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.220\nthat you are working on on a daily basis.\n\n77\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.810\nWell now you go home, and once you\nactually get home you realize that\n\n78\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.720\nthere was something that you needed to\ndo on that piece of software, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.460\nAnd then you have really, well one choice.\n\n80\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.920\nYou can go back to the office and\nthen continue to work from there.\n\n81\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.040\nOr you can maybe talk your boss into\nletting you take that computer system\n\n82\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.070\nhome with you so that you can work.\n\n83\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.390\nWell, neither of those two are gonna\nseem very much attractive.\n\n84\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.540\nOne to you, nor to your boss.\n\n85\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.049\nIn that particular instance is he gonna\nlet you take home company equipment\n\n86\n00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:37.613\nto do that?\n\n87\n00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:41.892\nSo in this sense, when we start talking\nabout the idea of cloud computing.\n\n88\n00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:44.727\nWhat Wes is really\nstressing is that instead,\n\n89\n00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:48.970\nit could be that that application\ncan be accessed from online.\n\n90\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.990\nAnd if it can be,\nthat means it's stored somewhere else and\n\n91\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.800\nwhat you're gonna do you're gonna\naccess it from any computer system.\n\n92\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.630\nYou're gonna normally pay a fee for it\nsomewhere, and then once you do that you\n\n93\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.760\ncan access it just about from\nany device that you want to.\n\n94\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.870\nSo for example I have\nan Office 365 online account.\n\n95\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.590\nAnd so what this means is regardless\nof where I go and travel in this world.\n\n96\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.180\nIf I need access to my EML, or\nto Word, or to PowerPoint, or\n\n97\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.840\nto Excel, one of those\nproductivity types of programs.\n\n98\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.990\nI don't necessarily have to\nhave my computer with me.\n\n99\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.100\nAll I need is a web browser,\nsomebody else's computer, and\n\n100\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.890\nI need my account that\nwill link me up to that.\n\n101\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.840\nAnd once I have that I have everything\nahead of me that I can actually use and\n\n102\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.770\nnot worry about whether or\nnot I have my own system.\n\n103\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.280\nYou might be wondering why is\nthis attractive to the business.\n\n104\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.630\nIt's attractive because it does allow\nus to be freed from the tethering\n\n105\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.280\nright there to that one\nindividual computer.\n\n106\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.470\nAnd now that company doesn't have\nto manage that software anymore.\n\n107\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.930\nThey don't have to worry about licensing\nrequirements that are also out there.\n\n108\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.710\nThey don't have to worry if Ronnie is\ngonna steal that software by making a copy\n\n109\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.130\nof it and then taking it home and putting\nit onto his computer at home as well.\n\n110\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.520\nSo there's a lot of benefits behind\ndoing this and you're gonna see more and\n\n111\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.340\nmore as you continue to work\nin the computing world.\n\n112\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.820\nThat this is what it's\ngoing to be as more and\n\n113\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.200\nmore companies are going to\nstart moving or off-shoring,\n\n114\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.875\nwhatever you want to call it in the terms\nthat you and I might understand.\n\n115\n00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:24.940\nOff-loading a lot of the heavy work on the\ninfrastructure side, on the software side,\n\n116\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.120\ninto a subscription based service\nlike what I was just talking about.\n\n117\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.550\nSo there's a lot of concepts here that\nwe have to actually start to understand.\n\n118\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.830\nBut that's the beginning and\nthe base of it.\n\n119\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.810\nSo Wes, what are some of the other\nconcepts we need to understand here?\n\n120\n00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.210\n>> Well there's a few different layers,\nright.\n\n121\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.090\nAnd like Ronnie said,\nit comes down to flexibility, right.\n\n122\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.700\nAnd the other thing I might add\nto do that is scalability, right?\n\n123\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.400\nWhen Ronnie was talking about licenses and\nthe software being installed.\n\n124\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.510\nScalability is the fact that what\nhappens if we just hired 50 new people?\n\n125\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.410\nRight, now we need 50 new\napplication instances, right?\n\n126\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.690\nWell it's easy if it is in\nthe cloud that we can just say,\n\n127\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.430\nthrough that web browser,\nnow we need to expand our license.\n\n128\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.940\nBut the components that we need to look\nat is, and there are many different ones.\n\n129\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.830\nBut there's really three primary\ncomponents that we have to look at.\n\n130\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.430\nWe have to look at something known\nas infrastructure as a service,\n\n131\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.120\nand we have to look at something\nknown as platform as a service.\n\n132\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.740\nWe also have to look at one that you're\nprobably gonna deal with more than\n\n133\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.030\nanything at a fundamental level.\n\n134\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.200\nThe ones that you probably even deal\nwith on a daily basis maybe and\n\n135\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.320\nyou don't even know it.\n\n136\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.960\nAnd that's software as a service and\nthat's the one that we're really gonna\n\n137\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.450\nlook at the most here, but\nwe are gonna explain all of them.\n\n138\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.930\nSo let's go ahead and coin a term,\nnot coin a term, this term is out there.\n\n139\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.015\nNow let's talk about something\nknown as on-premise, right?\n\n140\n00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:40.359\nIf we can go to my slide\nthat I got right here.\n\n141\n00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:44.295\nIf it is inside of your network,\nif it's inside of your home environment,\n\n142\n00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:48.041\nyou have to pay for all of these\ndevices to provide things like storage,\n\n143\n00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.609\nthe different services that you need\nin order to get your work done.\n\n144\n00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:56.458\nAs well as the applications,\nyou have to maintain it internally, so\n\n145\n00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:59.396\nit does require some upkeep, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:04.003\nHowever, what if you do need\nthose services, that storage,\n\n147\n00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:08.270\nthat information needs to\nbe stored somewhere, right.\n\n148\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.290\nYou need applications.\n\n149\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.390\nWell, we could start with something\nknown as infrastructure as a service.\n\n150\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.430\nAnd when we look at\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n151\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.180\nI want you to understand this is stored\nup there on somebody else's servers.\n\n152\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.070\nWhat does it give us access to?\n\n153\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.560\nWell, it gives us the access to things\nlike, computing, computers right?\n\n154\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.490\nI can log in, believe it or not,\nto a desktop through my web browser.\n\n155\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.080\nWhat's great about it is,\n\n156\n00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.070\nI don't even have to be sitting in\nthe physical location of that machine.\n\n157\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.650\nRight?\nWe can expand it like getting things,\n\n158\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.630\nlike more memory, more computing power.\n\n159\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.642\nNetwork communications and\nthings like, operating systems, right?\n\n160\n00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:49.364\nAnd again, I wouldn't worry too much about\nthese, especially at the fundamental\n\n161\n00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:52.608\nlevel, because of the fact that you're\nprobably not gonna see these and\n\n162\n00:08:52.608 --> 00:08:53.900\nnot deal with them.\n\n163\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.560\nBut it is good to know\nthese architectures.\n\n164\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.080\nNow, the next one here is something\nknown as platform as a service.\n\n165\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.096\nAnd if we can make this really simple,\n\n166\n00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:05.574\nimagine somebody is developing\na piece of software, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:05.574 --> 00:09:08.850\nWell when software developers\nstart to build their software,\n\n168\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.767\nthey need an environment that\nthey can work in, right?\n\n169\n00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:16.765\nAnd on our traditional old models that\nmeant that somebody in your IT department\n\n170\n00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:22.286\nwas gonna have to maintain the hardware,\nthe computers, the software that's running\n\n171\n00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:27.136\non those computers to give application\ndevelopers and programmers access to\n\n172\n00:09:27.136 --> 00:09:32.610\nthat layer that they need to work in,\nso they can start to build applications.\n\n173\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.550\nPlatform as a services says,\nyou know what?\n\n174\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.800\nAll those things that have to be\nmanaged by my internal IT staff,\n\n175\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.070\nlet's go ahead, pay that subscription\nlike Ronnie was mentioning and\n\n176\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.880\nlet's let them deal with that.\n\n177\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.008\nAnd then our application programmers,\nall they have to do, log in with a web\n\n178\n00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:53.332\nbrowser, and that whole environment that\nthey work in is already ready to go and\n\n179\n00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:57.331\nset up for them, and if it isn't\nthe availability to get that environment\n\n180\n00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:01.459\nready, really is just a click of a couple\nof buttons inside of a web browser,\n\n181\n00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:05.393\nversus me saying, hey, or Ronnie,\nmaybe Ronnie telling me, hey Wes,\n\n182\n00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:08.100\nI need you to put that\nserver in the server closet,\n\n183\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.681\nI need you to put this computer over here\nnext to the application developer's desk,\n\n184\n00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:16.889\nwe need you to get all this configured,\nI need you to install this software.\n\n185\n00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:19.798\nNo, we just go to a web browser\nwe make a few clicks and\n\n186\n00:10:19.798 --> 00:10:23.767\nthe whole thing is ready to go for, so\nplatform as a service is about that\n\n187\n00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:28.530\nenvironment, that area, that workbench,\nif you will, that developers work in.\n\n188\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.300\nAnd they need access to it and\nthey can get that through the cloud,\n\n189\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.940\nthrough the web browser.\n\n190\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.864\nNow this is the primary goal here.\n\n191\n00:10:35.864 --> 00:10:39.561\nThis is the one pretty much that\nwe've been talking about so far, and\n\n192\n00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:44.215\nit's probably the one you're going to deal\nwith more, more commonly, and like I said\n\n193\n00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:48.512\nsome of you out there might not be dealing\nwith this and he might not even know it.\n\n194\n00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:51.029\nThis is called software as a service,\nall right?\n\n195\n00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:54.704\nRonnie mentioned one, and that's the one\nwe actually we have in our diagram,\n\n196\n00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:55.774\nOffice 365 right?\n\n197\n00:10:55.774 --> 00:10:56.775\nThere are other examples,\n\n198\n00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:59.200\nthe one we're going to show\nyou is Google Docs coming up.\n\n199\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.180\nBut in an aspect like office, right?\n\n200\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.820\nIf I'm gonna install the office\napplication suite, right?\n\n201\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.760\nA series of productivity software, that's\na lot of installation that has to go on on\n\n202\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.250\neach machine that you want to\nbe able to use this software.\n\n203\n00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.060\nAll right, and\nthe same thing with the support.\n\n204\n00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.570\nIf somebody has a problem with their\ncomputer, right, now you have to go down\n\n205\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.799\nand you have to fix their computer before\nthey can even be productive in their work.\n\n206\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.090\nThen there's the expense of\nthe individual software as well.\n\n207\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.240\nBut imagine that software that is running,\n\n208\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.580\nis now running on somebody\nelse's computer, right?\n\n209\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.908\nAnd they tell you, open your web browser\nand go ahead and connect right to it.\n\n210\n00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:40.709\nAnd if you connect right to it,\n\n211\n00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:44.605\nnow the provider is gonna do things\nlike the maintenance, right?\n\n212\n00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.810\nThe provider provides\nthe software platform.\n\n213\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.190\nThe applications are no longer\nstored on your local hard drive.\n\n214\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.180\nWhich means, you don't have to worry\nabout local support on this one.\n\n215\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.250\nNot too much.\nJust you'll still have to worry about\n\n216\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.530\nend users for sure.\n\n217\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.524\nThe maintenance on the applications.\n\n218\n00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:06.040\nIt's all done by the person that\nyou're paying the subscriptions to.\n\n219\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.280\nSo all of that becomes kind of like\nthe Wizard of Oz, if you will.\n\n220\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.560\nThat's behind the curtain.\n\n221\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.680\nYou don't need to see it.\n\n222\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.180\nAll you need to see is in front of\nthe curtain, what you want access to.\n\n223\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.740\nAnd in this case, it's the software\nthat you use on a daily basis.\n\n224\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.970\nNow, this does require something,\nkeep in mind.\n\n225\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.440\nIt does require, Ronnie,\nhanded out in here, the web browser.\n\n226\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.920\nThat's one of the things to keep in mind,\n\n227\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.040\nyou access this software\nthrough the web browser.\n\n228\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.010\nBut one of the great things about this is,\nthere's different applications, right?\n\n229\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.590\nThat in office, in general, right,\nwe have what runs on our desktops,\n\n230\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.920\nwe have some that run on our tablets,\nwe have completely different suite that\n\n231\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.460\nprobably runs on our mobile devices,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.540\nWell imagine the ability to connect\nall those devices to the internet,\n\n233\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.440\nto the cloud and you can run them and\nyou don't have to worry about\n\n234\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.000\nthe inconsistencies on the background or\nthe diversity,\n\n235\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.810\nI should say of all the different\ndevices that you have to support.\n\n236\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.150\nSo that's where some more of that\nflexibility comes into play for us.\n\n237\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:08.150\nNow that being said, part of software,\nwell the majority of software as\n\n238\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.000\na service is based on what are known\nas web applications, all right.\n\n239\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.810\nThese web applications are what\nyou're actually connecting to and\n\n240\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.930\nare running on somebody else's network.\n\n241\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.000\nAgain, like Wizard of Oz, they're\nbehind the curtain that you don't see.\n\n242\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.999\nAll you need to see is the interface to\napplication that you use on a daily basis.\n\n243\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.320\nYou get to work with it.\n\n244\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.140\nYou get to use the application.\n\n245\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.150\nYou get to use and\n\n246\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.150\nstore the data, and your IT staff\ndoesn't have to worry about this.\n\n247\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.560\nNow, it all costs money.\n\n248\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.470\nIt doesn't matter if you're doing\nthis locally on machines or\n\n249\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.460\nyou're using the cloud.\n\n250\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.220\nIt's still gonna cost you money, but\nit's a totality of the money that it\n\n251\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.440\ncosts to maintain and\ndistribute the applications.\n\n252\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.120\nMakes it a lot easier.\n\n253\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.203\nHow about a small business?\n\n254\n00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:52.059\nMaybe a small business doesn't want to\napply for very expensive license and\n\n255\n00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:56.070\nthe software, again running at this\nstage depends on the licensing cost.\n\n256\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.070\nWell if I run a small business\nthat might put me under,\n\n257\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.670\nbefore I can even start business.\n\n258\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.150\nI haven't gained the collateral to\neven purchase the software to make\n\n259\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.810\nmy business successful.\n\n260\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.580\nWell that's okay, right?\n\n261\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.770\nMany of these providers out there\nallow you to be a small business and\n\n262\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.720\nyou pay them a reduced cost only for\n\n263\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.630\nthe functionality that you want, which\nis another thing that it's very modular.\n\n264\n00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.290\nI can pay for what I need.\n\n265\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.630\nI don't have to buy the expensive computer\nthat I'm not using all of its resources,\n\n266\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.390\nI went ahead and bought it, but\nI'm still not using all of its resources.\n\n267\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.140\nBut, hey, at least I can send\nan email very fast, right?\n\n268\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.480\nSo you're wasting money sometimes\nin that locally supported software.\n\n269\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.280\nNow I can say, I'm not wasting money\nbecause I'm only gonna pay for\n\n270\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.570\nthe subscription of the services\nthat I need at the time.\n\n271\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.891\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:44.122\nSo, Ronnie, again I've talked a lot, bud.\n\n273\n00:14:44.122 --> 00:14:46.875\nWhat do you say that we go ahead and\nwe see this in action here?\n\n274\n00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:48.114\n>> Sounds like a great idea.\n\n275\n00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:50.860\n>> All right, so\nI've gone ahead and what I've done,\n\n276\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.270\nI told you guys we were gonna look\na little bit at the Google Docs, right?\n\n277\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.410\nWe've mentioned and we've kinda talked\nabout the Office 365, I understand.\n\n278\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.080\nHopefully we're not\nlicensed violation here.\n\n279\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.390\nCoke versus Pepsi.\n\n280\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.450\nAgain, they're both sodas.\n\n281\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.790\nIt's what is your flavor?\n\n282\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.378\nThey both have their purposes, right?\n\n283\n00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:10.960\nAnd what we're talking about here is,\nagain that kind of aspect.\n\n284\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.001\nThis is Gmail, all right?\n\n285\n00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:16.440\nIf you use an email provider,\nlike we see right here.\n\n286\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.180\nGuess what?\n\n287\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.574\nYou didn't realize that you're using\nsoftware is a service before these terms\n\n288\n00:15:21.574 --> 00:15:23.225\neven became famous,right?\n\n289\n00:15:23.225 --> 00:15:25.262\nIf you've been using Gmail,\n\n290\n00:15:25.262 --> 00:15:30.242\ngoing back to the days when Yahoo was\nfirst starting out and AOL, right?\n\n291\n00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:34.515\nWhen you were using their email system,\nyou are seeing the beginnings of\n\n292\n00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:39.495\nwhat would later become and diversify\na little bit into software as a service.\n\n293\n00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:45.030\nSo, now we have the ability not only\nto use traditional things like email.\n\n294\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.790\nRight?\nWe can go over here and\n\n295\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.800\nlet me find out where that is.\n\n296\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:57.285\nSo for instance, in Gmail here, you'll see\nthis little, looks almost like a dial pad.\n\n297\n00:15:57.285 --> 00:15:59.820\n[LAUGH] If you will for a, on a cellphone.\n\n298\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.073\nAnd if I scroll down,\nmy head's kind of covering it up,\n\n299\n00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:06.137\nyou'll see that there are these,\nthe More option.\n\n300\n00:16:06.137 --> 00:16:06.759\nRight?\n\n301\n00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:09.824\nAnd notice that we have this\nthing called Docs, Google Docs.\n\n302\n00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:13.177\nAnd for the most part, most of these are\ngonna be software of the service because\n\n303\n00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:14.820\nthey are managing everything.\n\n304\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.024\nAll I have to do if I wanna use these\ndifferent pieces of software is I\n\n305\n00:16:18.024 --> 00:16:20.842\njust have to click on them, so\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n306\n00:16:20.842 --> 00:16:23.717\nLet's click on Google Docs.\n\n307\n00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:26.550\nAll right, now Google Docs.\n\n308\n00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.350\nI need a word processor, right?\n\n309\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.010\nI don't wanna download and\ninstall one locally.\n\n310\n00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.300\nMaybe I don't have that capability,\nmaybe that's, I don't know,\n\n311\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.490\nthat's not in our company's budget or\nplan.\n\n312\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:42.056\nWell, now I've got Google Docs and\nif I need to create a document, well,\n\n313\n00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:42.801\nhere it is.\n\n314\n00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.363\nI got a word processor, all right?\n\n315\n00:16:45.363 --> 00:16:48.210\nAnd we'll say no thanks to\nsome of the pop ups there,\n\n316\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.146\nvery nice of them to lead me\nthrough this wizard here.\n\n317\n00:16:51.146 --> 00:16:53.910\nWe'll say, okay,\n\n318\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.793\nthis is my cloud based doc, right?\n\n319\n00:16:58.793 --> 00:17:01.380\nAnd I can save this, all right?\n\n320\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.087\nNotice it says right here All\nchanges are saved in Drive.\n\n321\n00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:07.391\nWell, what's the drive?\n\n322\n00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:07.913\nWell see,\n\n323\n00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:11.510\nthat's part of the other services\nthat you get with the cloud, right?\n\n324\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.720\nRonnie mentioned Dropbox,\n\n325\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.150\nthis is going to Google Drive,\nconcepts are exactly the same.\n\n326\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.830\nThey're providing the storage for\nyou, right?\n\n327\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.390\nIf my hard drive on this computer fails,\n\n328\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.680\nthat's another thing too that we\nreally haven't touched base on.\n\n329\n00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.230\nIf the hard drive on this computer fails,\nwhat happens to this document?\n\n330\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.464\nWell, we could tell you what happens to\nthe documents that are on the hard drive\n\n331\n00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:31.059\nthemselves.\n\n332\n00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:33.912\nUnless we got a very\ngood recovery software,\n\n333\n00:17:33.912 --> 00:17:36.776\nwe're probably not gonna see them anymore.\n\n334\n00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:41.319\nBut this document is now stored\non somebody else's machine.\n\n335\n00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:47.323\nIn this case, it's Google's machines\nthat are providing me with the service,\n\n336\n00:17:47.323 --> 00:17:49.543\nhence software as a service.\n\n337\n00:17:49.543 --> 00:17:51.334\nBut is that all I have access to?\n\n338\n00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:52.330\nNo, not really.\n\n339\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.390\nIf I go over to here to this\nlittle documents home button here,\n\n340\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.970\nand again it's gonna be a little\nbit different in every one of\n\n341\n00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.840\nthe online offerings that they have.\n\n342\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.800\nIn this case,\nI hit documents home and notice here.\n\n343\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.320\nWe've got some, we've got Documents,\nwe've got Sheets, we've got Slides, right?\n\n344\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.920\nI need to give a presentation now,\nwell, I've got access to that.\n\n345\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.920\nI can create presentations in here,\nRonnie mentioned the Office Suite earlier.\n\n346\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.610\nWell, think about things like PowerPoint,\n\n347\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.970\nthis is just their equivalent\nof a presentation-type software.\n\n348\n00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:31.590\nAnd now I can create all of\nmy presentation documents.\n\n349\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.842\nGo back to home here and then,\nwhat if I need to enter data?\n\n350\n00:18:34.842 --> 00:18:36.252\nWell guess what?\n\n351\n00:18:36.252 --> 00:18:42.539\nThey've got an Excel-type spreadsheet\nplatform that's just called Sheets, right?\n\n352\n00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.762\nAnd what this does is it allows\nyou to create a spreadsheet\n\n353\n00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:48.540\nthat you can enter information.\n\n354\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.920\nNow how much of this did Ronnie and\n\n355\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.200\nmyself have to set up to\ndemonstrate beforehand to you?\n\n356\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.438\nDid we have to go out and grab the\nsoftware, install it on the local machine,\n\n357\n00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:02.546\npotentially configure license just to\nbe able to launch this software and\n\n358\n00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:03.752\nshow you in the demo?\n\n359\n00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:07.199\nNot at all, not at all,\nit just took me signing up for an account,\n\n360\n00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:10.612\nsometimes they're free of charge,\nsometimes you have to pay.\n\n361\n00:19:10.612 --> 00:19:14.490\nEither way, all I had to do was create an\naccount and either pay my subscription or\n\n362\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.642\nif it's free of charge,\nlog into the service and start to use it.\n\n363\n00:19:17.642 --> 00:19:21.720\nAnd now I've got a fully functional\npiece of software, an application,\n\n364\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.895\nin this case productivity application,\nthat I can use.\n\n365\n00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:28.730\nAnd when it comes to support behind\nthe scene, all I have to make sure is\n\n366\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.164\nthat I understand how to use this and\nthey've got plenty of help documentation.\n\n367\n00:19:33.164 --> 00:19:36.829\nBut when it comes to the hardware\nitself in the hard drives.\n\n368\n00:19:36.829 --> 00:19:38.134\nIf the provider is good,\n\n369\n00:19:38.134 --> 00:19:41.690\nchances are it's gonna be completely\ntransparent to the end user.\n\n370\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.227\nAnd what I mean about that\nis if there are problems,\n\n371\n00:19:44.227 --> 00:19:46.183\nyou most likely will not be aware of it.\n\n372\n00:19:46.183 --> 00:19:49.313\nNow we talked in other episodes\nof service level agreements.\n\n373\n00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.983\nKeep in mind that there is\na little bit of room for error.\n\n374\n00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:58.723\nBut for the most part, these systems\nare so good that in day-to-day operations,\n\n375\n00:19:58.723 --> 00:20:02.004\nyou might not see anything,\nyou might miss it.\n\n376\n00:20:02.004 --> 00:20:04.983\nYou'll never be aware that it's actually\nhappening, which is a great thing.\n\n377\n00:20:04.983 --> 00:20:09.476\nSo keep in mind some of the benefits\nthat we have in this software or\n\n378\n00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:14.314\nin software as a service is that you\ndon't have to install it locally.\n\n379\n00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:16.208\nRonnie's already mentioned mobility,\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:20.768\nI get the flexibility that if I'm at work,\nI can login to a web browser, I can use\n\n381\n00:20:20.768 --> 00:20:25.487\nthis application, I can turn around,\nsave this documentation, close it down.\n\n382\n00:20:25.487 --> 00:20:29.333\nI could travel to my house and\nall I need is a web browser, right?\n\n383\n00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:32.427\nMy IT staff that maybe\nworks I don't work for\n\n384\n00:20:32.427 --> 00:20:36.370\nthem, but maybe the IT staff\nneeds to handle security.\n\n385\n00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.566\nWell, in this case, they don't need to\nworry about the security aspect of it\n\n386\n00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.937\nbecause it's being managed\nin the background, right?\n\n387\n00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:45.247\nThey don't have to do the updates that's\nanother thing that I didn't stress too.\n\n388\n00:20:45.247 --> 00:20:46.139\nHow about updating?\n\n389\n00:20:46.139 --> 00:20:48.827\nThe maintenance I kinda mentioned,\nkinda hinted to it,\n\n390\n00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:50.955\nthe maintenance of an application, right?\n\n391\n00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:55.323\nYou have 50 computers that you need to\nnow update and roll out these updates.\n\n392\n00:20:55.323 --> 00:20:57.896\nNow you gotta get,\nhow am I gonna manage the updates?\n\n393\n00:20:57.896 --> 00:21:02.249\nWhat happens if these additions to\nthe software cause it to crash, right?\n\n394\n00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:07.281\nWell, we've got a plan for that that takes\nadditional resources, additional expense.\n\n395\n00:21:07.281 --> 00:21:11.391\nThey have maintenance cycles that go on\nwith these softwares of service that we're\n\n396\n00:21:11.391 --> 00:21:14.102\nwarned of it if it's gonna\ncause an initial downtime.\n\n397\n00:21:14.102 --> 00:21:18.982\nSo that we can plan and prepare for it,\nbut it doesn't charge us an extra expense,\n\n398\n00:21:18.982 --> 00:21:19.930\nright?\n\n399\n00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.664\nThey're maintaining it,\nthey do the updates, the running updates.\n\n400\n00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:27.202\nThey maintain the software and they\nmaintain the hardware that runs of it.\n\n401\n00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:31.807\n>> Wes, there's no doubt that there's\na lot more that there is to the idea of\n\n402\n00:21:31.807 --> 00:21:35.917\ncloud computing that you and\nI will never end up actually seeing.\n\n403\n00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:38.434\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nwow, is there really more?\n\n404\n00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:39.599\nThere really is.\n\n405\n00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:43.408\nThe very fact that you and I as an end\nuser we'll probably see things,\n\n406\n00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:46.900\nlike what Wes showed us,\nthe Google docs or the Office 365.\n\n407\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.036\nBut companies used a lot of these\nservices in the background and\n\n408\n00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:52.401\nit may not be something\nyou will encounter, but\n\n409\n00:21:52.401 --> 00:21:55.390\nyou you'll need to know that\nthey're actually out there.\n\n410\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.549\nAnd you might be actually wondering\nwhat's the benefit overall?\n\n411\n00:21:58.549 --> 00:22:03.068\nWell, they don't have to worry again about\nthe outlay of the expenses up front,\n\n412\n00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:06.862\nabout keeping things,\nlike storage devices and storage systems.\n\n413\n00:22:06.862 --> 00:22:10.812\nEven backups that we talked about\nin the previous episode for\n\n414\n00:22:10.812 --> 00:22:15.236\na single computer and we may not\nstore it up in the cloud, but we can.\n\n415\n00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:19.262\nBut a lot of companies are beginning\nto actually have their data backed up\n\n416\n00:22:19.262 --> 00:22:20.850\ndirectly to cloud storage.\n\n417\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.598\nIn other words,\nhand it off to another company and\n\n418\n00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:26.419\nallow the actual storage\nto be done there instead.\n\n419\n00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:30.437\nAnd any time you actually hear about\nsomething like that where you know that\n\n420\n00:22:30.437 --> 00:22:33.115\na company is paying a subscription for\na service,\n\n421\n00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:36.463\nyou are probably talking about\nsome form of cloud computing.\n\n422\n00:22:36.463 --> 00:22:40.103\nThis is true whether we're talking\nabout infrastructure as a service,\n\n423\n00:22:40.103 --> 00:22:42.977\nplatform as a service, or\nsoftware as a service as well.\n\n424\n00:22:42.977 --> 00:22:46.983\nMake sure you understand that those are\nexamples that we gave that you're gonna\n\n425\n00:22:46.983 --> 00:22:47.820\nencounter, but\n\n426\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.434\nthere are a lot of other ones that\nare out there that are available to us.\n\n427\n00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:55.619\nEven ITProTV uses a lot of these\nservices in the background as well.\n\n428\n00:22:55.619 --> 00:23:00.328\nAnd the whole goal is fairly simple, it's\nto provide the best experience possible\n\n429\n00:23:00.328 --> 00:23:04.447\nfor our users, so that we don't have\nto worry about equipment failure.\n\n430\n00:23:04.447 --> 00:23:06.607\nIf you're watching this live,\n\n431\n00:23:06.607 --> 00:23:10.528\nwe're streaming this through\na cloud service provider.\n\n432\n00:23:10.528 --> 00:23:14.930\nSo our content is leaving our studios and\nactually going out to the Internet and\n\n433\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.340\ncoming directly to you.\n\n434\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.863\nAt the same time,\nIf you're actually on our website and\n\n435\n00:23:18.863 --> 00:23:22.678\nthose files that you're downloading, if\nyou happen to be downloading from there or\n\n436\n00:23:22.678 --> 00:23:23.929\neven watching from there.\n\n437\n00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:27.610\nThose things are also coming\nfrom a cloud provider as well.\n\n438\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.190\nWhat that means is Wes doesn't\nhave to stay up 24 hours a day,\n\n439\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.720\nmaking sure that those servers are up and\noperating.\n\n440\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.380\nIf so, he'd probably go psychotic by now.\n\n441\n00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.300\nBut overall though,\nit means we don't have to worry about it.\n\n442\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.580\nIt means we offload that\nconcern by simply saying,\n\n443\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.240\nwe're gonna pay this\namount of money to do so.\n\n444\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.200\nAnd then those providers will ensure\nthat our servers are kept up and\n\n445\n00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.750\nthat we're actually uploading\nthe content that's up to us to do.\n\n446\n00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.750\nBut that way,\n\n447\n00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.870\nanybody going to ITPro.TV's website should\nbe able to access ITPro.TV 24 hours a day,\n\n448\n00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.070\n7 days a week without Wes going\npsychotic is pretty much what we have.\n\n449\n00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.930\nAnd that's because we're willing\nto pay the expense of that.\n\n450\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.442\nAnd that means we don't worry about\na 10-year-old server sitting behind me\n\n451\n00:24:13.442 --> 00:24:16.620\nthat's waiting to fail at any\none point in time as well.\n\n452\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.507\nSo you gotta realize that that's\nwhy you're starting to see more and\n\n453\n00:24:19.507 --> 00:24:20.116\nmore of this.\n\n454\n00:24:20.116 --> 00:24:23.712\nAnd if you do have a smart phone\nyou're probably already connected to\n\n455\n00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.890\na cloud service and\nyou just don't even realize it, right?\n\n456\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.590\nThe very fact that you\nhave a smart phone and\n\n457\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.630\nyou might have had an Android device or\nan Apple device.\n\n458\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.190\nWell, remember that if\nyou're getting email,\n\n459\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.160\nthat's from a server\nthat's actually not yours.\n\n460\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.380\nYou didn't pay for that server,\nI didn't pay for that server.\n\n461\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.070\nSomebody else is paying for that server,\nbut yet I still get the use of it.\n\n462\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.770\nYou and I are actually using\nthe cloud service as well,\n\n463\n00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.440\neven when we didn't\nrealize we were doing so.\n\n464\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.594\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n465\n00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:58.343\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n466\n00:24:58.343 --> 00:24:59.428\n>> And I'm Wes Ryan.\n\n467\n00:24:59.428 -->

00:00:16.860\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.850\nyou're watching\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.160\nWhere we're about to take a look at\nsome of the basic types of security\n\n6\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.400\nthat we need to actually understand and\n\n7\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.530\nwe're gonna probably encounter\nin the world of computing today.\n\n8\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.220\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.250\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n10\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.540\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.780\nAs always great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.420\nThat's right,\nwe're gonna dive into some security.\n\n13\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.790\nAnd again, we're not gonna get too\nin depth on security cuz security is\n\n14\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.060\na major topic in and of itself.\n\n15\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.650\nIn fact, it really isn't\na destination to be reached.\n\n16\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.150\nIt's a journey to be traveled upon,\nas I heard one security guru say.\n\n17\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.270\nSo a lot of different components in here,\n\n18\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.100\nbut we do wanna look\nat some of the basics.\n\n19\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.500\nWell, we started when we talk\nabout securing our computers.\n\n20\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.700\nSecuring our computing environment,\nwhat is it that we start with?\n\n21\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.750\nWell first and foremost, I want you to\nthink of it as, well, if we want to keep\n\n22\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.860\nour house safe, the first thing we have\nto do is at least lock the front door.\n\n23\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.560\nAnd potentially, the back door too.\n\n24\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.980\nBut with our computing systems,\n\n25\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.850\nthe way we lock the front is by\ncreating what is known as a password.\n\n26\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.600\nA password is probably the most\ncommon security implementation.\n\n27\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.770\nFirst step, if you will,\n\n28\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.440\nsecurity implementation in\nthe computing world in general.\n\n29\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.990\nNow, it doesn't just have to\ndo with our computers, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.220\nOur computers, we definitely want\nto password protect them, but\n\n31\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.180\nI want you to think of your bank account,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.980\nMaybe the computer doesn't\nsound that important to you,\n\n33\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.100\nbecause maybe you're dealing\nwith it in a home environment.\n\n34\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.195\nYou say, well, I'm at home,\nthat's not that important to me.\n\n35\n00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:47.130\nWell, lets go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.020\ntalk about passwords from\nthe perspective of your bank account.\n\n37\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.240\nNow, you might wanna think about\nyour password when it comes to\n\n38\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910\nlogging in maybe online.\n\n39\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.510\nYou browse to your bank's website,\n\n40\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.698\nyou're probably gonna wanna make\nsure that your money stays secure.\n\n41\n00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:04.540\nSo when you start talking about money,\nall of a sudden,\n\n42\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.200\nsecurity starts to become important.\n\n43\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.420\nBut I want you to understand that\nit's just as important and it's\n\n44\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.730\nimperative that you implement this inside\nof your computing environment as well.\n\n45\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.200\nEspecially, if you're\ndealing with sensitive data\n\n46\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.540\nthat you don't want anybody\nelse to have access to.\n\n47\n00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.470\nSo that's what we're\ngonna talk about Ronnie.\n\n48\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.320\nWe're gonna start by talking about\na concept known as secure passwords.\n\n49\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.248\n&gt;&gt; Whenever we start talking about this\nidea of overall security, we wanna make\n\n50\n00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:31.850\nsure that we mention the idea and\nthe goal behind all computer security.\n\n51\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.760\nAnd that means that every single\nimplementation that Wes is about\n\n52\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.950\nto talk about helps us to meet\none of three security goals.\n\n53\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.578\nThat's either gonna be data\nconfidentiality, data integrity, or\n\n54\n00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.410\ndata availability.\n\n55\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.598\nData confidentially means that we\ncan hide the data from people that\n\n56\n00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:52.090\nare unauthorized to be able to see\nthe data itself or to access that data.\n\n57\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.470\nData integrity prevents\nthe data from being corrupted,\n\n58\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.180\nI can't say what I wanted to say there.\n\n59\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.220\nFrom being able to be corrupted\nis what I wanted to say.\n\n60\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.870\nAnd in that sense, it allows me to be\nable to check, that the original data,\n\n61\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.080\nif I now transfer it from one machine\nto another, I can then go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.580\nalso verify that nothing has changed.\n\n63\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.750\nThereby saying, the data that\nexisted as the original source,\n\n64\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.220\nthe copy that I have are exactly the same.\n\n65\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.480\nAnd then, of course, data availability.\n\n66\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.090\nMaking sure that my data is available\nto those that are authorized to be\n\n67\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.970\nable to access that data.\n\n68\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.620\nAnd that way we keep it open and we need\nit actually available for those users or\n\n69\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.590\nour data becomes useless.\n\n70\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.360\nAny security measure that we put in\nplace that does not help us to do that\n\n71\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.090\nis not really a security measure as\nmuch as it's just another chain or\n\n72\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.910\nanother thing that we add in thinking\nthat it's security, but it is not.\n\n73\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.750\nAnd so the best place for\nus to begin is that most simple concept\n\n74\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.902\nof the idea of using passwords or\nsetting up credentials.\n\n75\n00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:56.420\nSo, Wes,\nwhen we talk about setting up a password,\n\n76\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.830\nit doesn't seem like\nit's really a big deal.\n\n77\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.630\nI know what password I would use,\nwhich is fairly simple, and so\n\n78\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.510\nthat's all I need, right?\n\n79\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.500\nI just need a simple password,\nand I should be ready to go.\n\n80\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what,\nthat will lock your computer.\n\n81\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.640\nBut a lot of times what it\ndoes is the only thing that'll\n\n82\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.190\nkeep people out is the legitimate\npeople that should be in the computer.\n\n83\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.780\nYou know, it'll keep them out but\n\n84\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.160\nit doesn't really stop the bad guys,\nthat's right.\n\n85\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.170\nSo for instance, if I decided\nthat my suitcase to my luggage,\n\n86\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.520\nI wanna make the password 123456,\nwell, is that secure?\n\n87\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.950\nI've locked it for sure, but\nultimately, if I forget it,\n\n88\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.870\nthat's really just gonna keep me out\nof it, it's not gonna keep the bad guys\n\n89\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.780\nout of it cuz they can go through\nthings like guessing these passwords.\n\n90\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.450\nWe also have software out there\nthat helps the guessing process,\n\n91\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.170\ntake some of the legwork out of it.\n\n92\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.760\nAnd we can transfer that over to a piece\nof software that can do all these magic\n\n93\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.910\nthings to actually guess your password.\n\n94\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.670\nSo that's why we wanna implement\nsomething known as password complexity.\n\n95\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.550\nWhat does that mean?\n\n96\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.390\nWell, we'll start out with the basics\nof password complexity, right?\n\n97\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.390\nYou have four character sets on\nyou keyboard, and what this says\n\n98\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.350\nis you should use a combination\nof all of those character sets.\n\n99\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.520\nWell, what is a character set?\n\n100\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.620\nWell, I want you to think of\nthe alphabet to start with, right?\n\n101\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.140\nIf I use lower case letters,\nright, I have A to Z.\n\n102\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.900\nThat's one of the character sets.\n\n103\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.360\nHowever, I can also capitalize, right?\n\n104\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.230\nThat's one thing that we\nalso have to step back.\n\n105\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.040\nAnd I do wanna make sure that I mention,\nRonnie, not just assume you know.\n\n106\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.600\nPasswords are case-sensitive.\n\n107\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.220\nSo a case sensitivity means there's\na difference between a lowercase a and\n\n108\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.930\nan uppercase A.\n\n109\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.302\nNow in writing this,\nwe obviously know that.\n\n110\n00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:38.740\nBut understand, to the computer,\nit means something completely different.\n\n111\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.380\nSo those are two of the character sets.\n\n112\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.440\nWhen you look at your alphabet and\nyou say lowercase and you say uppercase.\n\n113\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.010\nWell, what are the other two character\nsets that we have, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.640\nI want you to think of\nthe numbers zero through nine.\n\n115\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.640\nNow, we have a third character\nset that we're adding in there.\n\n116\n00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.250\nLast but not least, and\nI'm not going to mention all of them,\n\n117\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.850\nwe'll mention just what they are and\nthat's the special characters.\n\n118\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.850\nThat is four different character sets.\n\n119\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.170\nAnd if you implement something\nknown as password complexity,\n\n120\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.480\nthen what that means is,\nyour gonna use all of those.\n\n121\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.990\nI tell you what, let me go ahead and\nI'll create a text document here.\n\n122\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.440\nAnd I'll kinda show you what I mean here.\n\n123\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.830\nLet me go ahead and bump up the size\na little bit so we can see this.\n\n124\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.220\nExamples of a password using\nall of the four character sets.\n\n125\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.860\nRemember, we have a through z,\nwe have A through Z.\n\n126\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.090\nWe have 0 through 9 and then we have,\nand again, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n127\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.690\nwrite it out,\nwe've got our special characters.\n\n128\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.550\nSo if I'm gonna create a strong password,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.790\nshow you an example of\none that isn't strong.\n\n130\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.640\nIf I say, password is that strong?\n\n131\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.820\nWell no, unfortunately it isn't,\n\n132\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.160\nbecause of the fact that it's only\nusing a single character set.\n\n133\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.250\nWell you say, okay, let's go ahead and\nwe'll throw in 2, right?\n\n134\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.040\nWe'll do something like maybe like this,\nwe'll do Passw0rd.\n\n135\n00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:10.910\nAll right, let's go ahead, and\nwe'll keep some of those up.\n\n136\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.790\nAnd you know what, I am so used to doing\nthis, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n137\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.710\nHere, let's not put a 0 in there yet.\n\n138\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.260\nAll right,\nnotice that I have an uppercase here.\n\n139\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.430\nWell what does the uppercase do?\n\n140\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.260\nWell, that now gets me the ability\nto use two of those character sets,\n\n141\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.420\nwe've got the lowercase letters and\nwe've got the uppercase letters.\n\n142\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.650\nBut that still doesn't meet what\nwe call a complex password, right?\n\n143\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.111\nNow, if I go a little bit farther than\nthis, and I had three character sets,\n\n144\n00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:48.250\nwell, now I am creating a little\nbit more of a complex password.\n\n145\n00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:54.472\nMaybe I do something like this,\nwhere I do capital P-a-s-s-w-0-r-d.\n\n146\n00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:59.106\nAll right, now that is getting\nmore complex because now I've got\n\n147\n00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:01.811\nthree of the character sets in there.\n\n148\n00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:06.101\nNow, any time you add a character\nset to this what you have is this\n\n149\n00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:08.400\nexponential curve.\n\n150\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.650\nAnd the power that it takes a CPU to try\nto rifle through that software that I was\n\n151\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.830\ntelling you, they can try to\nfind out what this password is,\n\n152\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.560\nanytime you start adding character sets\nan additional characters themselves.\n\n153\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.170\nWhich we'll get into you,\nyou make that password harder and\n\n154\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.730\nharder to crack,\nwhich means finding out what it is.\n\n155\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:33.019\nSo if I take something finally like this,\nour fourth example and\n\n156\n00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:38.607\nI do P@ ssw0rd or\nmaybe I change it around a little bit and\n\n157\n00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:43.267\nI do Pa$$w0rd, or\nI do something like this,\n\n158\n00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:47.945\nI can even go as far\nas doing an !Pass1234.\n\n159\n00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:51.520\nNow, these are just some examples,\nthese last few.\n\n160\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.607\nThey use all the character sets.\n\n161\n00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:59.280\nNow, these are common passwords,\nthat does not make them strong.\n\n162\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.060\nThe concept here is to understand by\nutilizing all of the character sets,\n\n163\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.640\nyou make it harder and harder,\none for people to guess, and\n\n164\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.029\nfor software that's gonna\nassist people in doing this.\n\n165\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.150\nThe other thing is what we know as\ncharacter limit, or how many characters.\n\n166\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.480\nAs you add additional characters you're\nmaking it harder, and harder to guess.\n\n167\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.490\nAnd harder for\nthe software that the hackers,\n\n168\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.610\nyou these attackers\nare using in the background.\n\n169\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.890\nSo that essentially makes\na complex password.\n\n170\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.760\nAnd by using one of these types of\npasswords, again because it says password,\n\n171\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.655\nplease don't take that as\nsomething you should use.\n\n172\n00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:43.245\nWhen you formulate your password,\nmake it unique to you.\n\n173\n00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:48.285\nIf I love guitars, I love music, well,\nRonnie could start profiling and\n\n174\n00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:52.703\nguessing maybe a password based on some\nof the things that he hears me say.\n\n175\n00:09:52.703 --> 00:09:56.445\nSo I wanna make something that's unique to\nme, but at the same time, I don't wanna\n\n176\n00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:59.475\nmake it something that maybe somebody\ncan guess based on my personality,\n\n177\n00:09:59.475 --> 00:10:01.570\nbased on my traits\nare something that I like.\n\n178\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.901\nNow, that being said, there are a couple\nof password no noes, very basically\n\n179\n00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:14.150\nthat we wanna kinda take care of here,\nand that is writing passwords down.\n\n180\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.319\nYou do run the risk, Ronnie was telling\nyou about the metrics the we kinda\n\n181\n00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:25.410\ngauge ourselves with as to make sure that\nif it is secure is it meeting this goals.\n\n182\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.560\nConfidentiality, he mention data\nintegrity and data availability.\n\n183\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.290\nWell, here is the problem I can make this\nso complex that even I can't remember it.\n\n184\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.880\nSo now we've done the first two that\nhe talked about confidentiality,\n\n185\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.850\nnobody can get into my computer.\n\n186\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.400\nIntegrity, since no one can get into\nthe computer they can’t modify the data.\n\n187\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.820\nSo we met the first two.\n\n188\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.140\nThe problem is now that\nI can't remember it,\n\n189\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.450\nthe availability is completely hindered.\n\n190\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.210\nSo what will I do?\n\n191\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.120\nAs you start to make this\na little bit too complex or a lot\n\n192\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.000\nof characters you might have the idea that\nlet me just go ahead and write that down.\n\n193\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.980\nWell, now here's the problem.\n\n194\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.680\nYou've got it in a written format that if\npeople can get access to that information,\n\n195\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.240\nthey can get into your computer and\n\n196\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.730\nnow it doesn't matter that\nyou've got this 15, 16, 20, 40,\n\n197\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.979\n80 character password because now somebody\ncould potentially have access to it.\n\n198\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.220\nHow about this?\n\n199\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.539\nThe other thing that is\na big password no-no,\n\n200\n00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:27.889\nme writing that password down and\nsending it over to Ronnie.\n\n201\n00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.350\nNow, you're sharing passwords.\n\n202\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.010\nAnd there are applications or\n\n203\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.650\nimplementations inside of\na corporate network where maybe they\n\n204\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.240\nmight wanna do that but\nthat is a major security vulnerability.\n\n205\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.320\nSharing passwords is something\nthat we shouldn't do.\n\n206\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.948\nNow, reusing passwords is\nanother one that's a big no-no.\n\n207\n00:11:45.948 --> 00:11:50.468\nAnd there's a couple of different ways or\nreasons that we might reuse a password or\n\n208\n00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:52.379\nmight lead us to reuse a password.\n\n209\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.660\nFirst and foremost we're gonna say if\nyou're in a company that is implementing\n\n210\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.840\npassword complexity,\n\n211\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.790\nthey say you don't have a choice, our\nsystems in here are gonna stay secure and\n\n212\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.130\nyou're gonna have to create a password\nthat has those four character sets and\n\n213\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.939\nhas this character, how many\nadditional characters do you have?\n\n214\n00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.770\nThey will also implement something\nknown as password history.\n\n215\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.600\nAnd this is an implementation,\nthis is a rule, if you will.\n\n216\n00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.370\nWe call it policies, but think of it as\na rule that says, okay, once you've used,\n\n217\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.790\nin fact, we can go back to my screen here.\n\n218\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.620\nOnce you've used this password,\nright here.\n\n219\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.010\nI don't want you to reuse this password.\n\n220\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.640\nI'm gonna require you to\nchange this password.\n\n221\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.130\nSo we'll use some of\nthe other examples here.\n\n222\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.550\nNow what, if I could type it.\n\n223\n00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.640\nI can't even type my own password\nwhich would hinder availability too.\n\n224\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.530\nNow, the problem with a password that\nnever changes is the fact that it\n\n225\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.980\ngives anyone who might want to\nget access to your computer,\n\n226\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.960\nyour bank account, your email information,\nyour social media an account.\n\n227\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.850\nIt give them all the time they need\nto perform some of these evil things,\n\n228\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.170\nthese nasty things that go on against\na password to try to get that information.\n\n229\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.390\nTry to break that password.\n\n230\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.850\nSo what your company might do is say,\n\n231\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.230\nyou know what, once you use that first\npassword now you've gotta change it.\n\n232\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.310\nAnd you can only use that password for\nthis length of time.\n\n233\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.240\nAnd then, you've gotta change it again.\n\n234\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.840\nNow, that being said,\nthe other situation and scenario in\n\n235\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.339\nwhich you might reuse a password is\nwhen you have multiple accounts.\n\n236\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.640\nI have to be honest here,\n\n237\n00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.860\nI've got a couple of accounts\nthat have the same password.\n\n238\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.260\nNow, should I be doing that?\n\n239\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.940\nNo.\nTechnically I shouldn't,\n\n240\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.810\nbecause I want you to imagine.\n\n241\n00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.520\nThis might have happened, you might\nhave seen this happen, but all the time,\n\n242\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.650\nbig social media and big companies,\n\n243\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:57.340\nyou'll get a security report that says\n500,000 accounts were compromised.\n\n244\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.070\nAnd sometimes they force you\nto change your password.\n\n245\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.430\nWell, here's a problem with that.\n\n246\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.840\nIf these thieves can get your account\ninformation, can get your name and\n\n247\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.900\ncan get your password,\n\n248\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.810\nthey can use that information to go to\nother accounts that you might have.\n\n249\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.240\nTo see, hey, let me try that password on\nthe next account and see if it works.\n\n250\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.930\nAnd if it happens to be that maybe you\nhave the same password that you have on\n\n251\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.129\nyour social media as you\ndo your bank account.\n\n252\n00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.070\nWell, now you've just given somebody\npotential access to your bank account,\n\n253\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.260\nnot only your social media.\n\n254\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.910\nSo that's why reusing passwords\nreally isn't a good idea.\n\n255\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.860\nSo what is one of the ways\nthat we can get around this?\n\n256\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.630\nWell, one of the ways that we can do\nthat is through something known as\n\n257\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.720\na single sign-on.\n\n258\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.130\nNow, the single sign-on for us, that's\nsomething that is a little bit different.\n\n259\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.530\nWhat this does very basically is\nthis allows me to log in one time.\n\n260\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:55.970\nAnd I can, basically it's like saving the\npassword in a location that allows me to\n\n261\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.840\nbasically log into other services and\nI don't have to re-enter the password.\n\n262\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.770\nNow, that's a single sign\non method right there.\n\n263\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.170\nSSO as you might hear it called.\n\n264\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.590\nMakes it a lot easier for the user and\nspecially when you have one password for\n\n265\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.450\nall these different services\nthat you might need.\n\n266\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.300\nMakes it easier on you as well.\n\n267\n00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.370\nSo for instance,\nI'm logged in to Gmail here.\n\n268\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.790\nAnd if I decide, hey,\nI wanna go to another service they have.\n\n269\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.200\nAnd I decide hey I'm gonna go over to,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n270\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.330\nhit the more button here,\nI'm gonna go to my Google Docs.\n\n271\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.280\nWe shown that in another episode.\n\n272\n00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.300\nWell, I didn't have to turn around and\nlog back in.\n\n273\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.570\nNotice that it said okay, you're logged in\nto Gmail, we see your valid credentials,\n\n274\n00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.870\nwhich we're talking about username and\npassword.\n\n275\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.075\nWell, since there the same here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n276\n00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:46.309\nwe'll [SOUND] apply those username and\npassword credentials to the account and\n\n277\n00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:48.175\nthe service that you're\ntrying to log in to.\n\n278\n00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:51.970\nSo it makes a lot easier on the end user.\n\n279\n00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.110\nNow, what are some other things you can\ndo with your passwords to make them\n\n280\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.770\na little bit safer?\n\n281\n00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.671\nThat's something known\nas password managers.\n\n282\n00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:03.629\nNow, you got a few different types of\npassword managers you can have in fact\n\n283\n00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:06.872\nyou do have one that is\nbuilt right in to Windows.\n\n284\n00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:08.759\nWe can actually show you that right here.\n\n285\n00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:12.923\nYou have for instance, something in\nWindows called the Credential Manager.\n\n286\n00:16:12.923 --> 00:16:15.467\nAnd if I go to Control Panel\nlike we've been lately, and\n\n287\n00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:17.020\nI go to System and Security.\n\n288\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.510\nAnd you know I went to the wrong place.\n\n289\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.640\nJust a bit outside, go on.\n\n290\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.732\nHow about User Accounts and Family Safety\nand then we got this Credential Manager.\n\n291\n00:16:24.732 --> 00:16:28.800\nAll right, well it stores the credentials\nfor me and keeps them in a safe location\n\n292\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.250\nthat I can also use them, and\nallow the machine to log in for\n\n293\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.540\nme to the different services and\nplaces that I visit.\n\n294\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.050\nNow, that all goes back to\nthe front door being locked, right?\n\n295\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.110\nBecause if somebody gains your\npassword to your computer,\n\n296\n00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.780\nthey potentially have\naccess to this information.\n\n297\n00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.200\nNow, what's more common out there today\nis to have a password manager and\n\n298\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.750\nwe'll go ahead and\nkinda show you this, too.\n\n299\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.050\nIf I decided that I wanted\na company to manage this for me and\n\n300\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.430\nI didn't have to worry about it,\nit would stay in a secure environment.\n\n301\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.220\nI could do something like LastPass.\n\n302\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.370\nThat's one that I use out here.\n\n303\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.280\nAnd you can see LastPass here,\nit's a password manager.\n\n304\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.920\nIt allows me to remember one password and\n\n305\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.550\nwhat I can do is I can log\nin with that one password.\n\n306\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.527\nAnd like a single sign on as I visit\ndifferent sites that I've saved\n\n307\n00:17:13.527 --> 00:17:17.519\nthe password here in the password\nmanager it instantly logs me in.\n\n308\n00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:21.984\nWhat's also good about some of these\npasswords is it gives you the ability to\n\n309\n00:17:21.984 --> 00:17:24.845\ngenerate a strong password\nwith a little meter,\n\n310\n00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:28.195\na little application built\ninto the software that says,\n\n311\n00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:32.284\nif you want a 17 character password,\ngo ahead and generate me one.\n\n312\n00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:34.575\nAnd it shows you the strength level right?\n\n313\n00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:37.695\nMaybe you wanna bump it up a little bit,\nyou wanna make it a 20 character password.\n\n314\n00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:41.059\nWell, you can generate one and\nit shows you what the password is, and\n\n315\n00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.965\nthen you can implement that on\nwhatever your logging into.\n\n316\n00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:47.285\nBut the great thing is they\nmanage the password for you.\n\n317\n00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:52.140\nSo, protect your systems,\nprotect your accounts.\n\n318\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.870\nUse complex passwords.\n\n319\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.840\nDon't reuse passwords.\n\n320\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.950\nMake sure that you're\nlogging into the systems.\n\n321\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.870\nMake sure that you're keeping them secure.\n\n322\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.968\nYou might not think that that computer\nthat you're using has any sensitive\n\n323\n00:18:03.968 --> 00:18:06.908\ninformation because all you\ndo is check your emails.\n\n324\n00:18:06.908 --> 00:18:09.358\nWell, I can tell you right now,\nif you use a web browser and\n\n325\n00:18:09.358 --> 00:18:12.410\nyou log in to your bank account and\ncheck your bank account information.\n\n326\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.850\nThere's a potential that the browser that\nyou're using stores that information.\n\n327\n00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.570\nAnd if somebody attacks your computer,\nsince you don't have it\n\n328\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.640\npassword protected,\nthey could get that information.\n\n329\n00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.185\nAnd now they do have access\nto sensitive information.\n\n330\n00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:29.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's also talk about the idea of\n\n331\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.070\nconnecting securely to\nwebsites that are out there.\n\n332\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.450\nWe know that our browser has that ability.\n\n333\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.240\nBut what else do we need to know?\n\n334\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.190\n&gt;&gt; There is a type of\ncommunication out there and\n\n335\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.870\nin networks we have\nrules of communication.\n\n336\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.730\nThey are called protocols,\nnow there is one protocol.\n\n337\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.770\nThere is one service\nthat's provided out there\n\n338\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.920\nthat allows you to make\na secure connection between,\n\n339\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.860\nlet's say my machine right here and\nwherever that website is being stored.\n\n340\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.980\nLet me give you an example of this,\nin fact, I can already see\n\n341\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.780\nin Google Docs here,\nthis protocol that I'm talking about.\n\n342\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.640\nYou can see https,\nnow what does that mean?\n\n343\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.870\nThat means that this is\na secure web communication.\n\n344\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.850\nWhat do you mean by secure?\n\n345\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.590\nYou say Wes what do you mean by secure?\n\n346\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.820\nWell that means before and,\nwe didn't see this,\n\n347\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.610\nyou notice I just launched up\nGoogle Docs and it went right there.\n\n348\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.270\nWhat that means for me is that\nthis web browser, this software,\n\n349\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.580\nthis application went to\nconnect to Google's servers and\n\n350\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.790\nbefore that happened they both showed\neach other their driver's license.\n\n351\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.390\nIf you think about,\nif I go into a bank physically and\n\n352\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.020\nI wanna gain access to my resources.\n\n353\n00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.090\nYou say what resources\nyou're talking about?\n\n354\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:51.880\nMoney, right?\n\n355\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.060\nOr lack there of.\n\n356\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.630\nIf I go to the bank,\nwhat are they doing to do?\n\n357\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.790\nThey're going to ask me for\n\n358\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.560\na form of identification before they\neven let me see the banking information.\n\n359\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.720\nAll right, and they could ask me to\nuse two forms of authentication,\n\n360\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.620\nbut most of the time\nthey're good with one.\n\n361\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.050\nWell, guess what?\n\n362\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.810\nWhen you connect to another\ncomputer that is gonna\n\n363\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:20.550\ncreate this what we call HTTPS,\na secure web connection,\n\n364\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.010\nthe very first thing that it does is\nit says, here's my driver's license.\n\n365\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.820\nYou can see who I am.\n\n366\n00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.740\nYou know that in making a connection,\nI am who I say I am.\n\n367\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.990\nWell how do you know that, right?\n\n368\n00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.030\nI can sit here right now and I could go\nover to the printer right and I could\n\n369\n00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:44.070\nprint off something that looks liked\na photo ID that had my face on it but Mr.\n\n370\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.490\nRonny Wong's name on it, all right.\n\n371\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.830\nNow what's gonna happen when I go and\n\n372\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.910\npresent that to the bank, well the bank's\ngonna say, that's just a piece of paper.\n\n373\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.470\nWhat is that?\n\n374\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.500\nWhy don't they trust it?\n\n375\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.100\nWhy do they sit there and laugh at you and\nmaybe call the cops on you?\n\n376\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.500\nThat's because i printed\nthis from a printer.\n\n377\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.875\nThe paper that it's on Is not trusted,\nbecause they don't trust the person\n\n378\n00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:08.525\nthat made and\ncreated this identification form, me.\n\n379\n00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:12.105\nHowever, if I pull out my ID, and\nI hand them my drivers license,\n\n380\n00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:16.630\nthey trust my drivers license because\nin this case I live in Florida.\n\n381\n00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.940\nThey trust the authority that\ngave me that drivers licence.\n\n382\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:25.320\nAnd the process you have to go through to\nobtain that ID or that drivers license.\n\n383\n00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.140\nWell these servers out there that\nwanna be publicly trusted are legit\n\n384\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.870\ncompanies like Google.\n\n385\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.840\nBank of America is one out there\ntoo that I use all the time.\n\n386\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.640\nThey go through a pretty strict process to\n\n387\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.840\nensure that they their servers\nare who say there are.\n\n388\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.030\nAnd what happens is that driver license\nit's a little it's called a digital\n\n389\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.000\ncertificate but\njust think of it as a driver license.\n\n390\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.100\nThe identification that is\ngiven to them is signed by\n\n391\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.653\nsomebody that everybody\nin the world trust.\n\n392\n00:21:54.653 --> 00:21:58.633\nAll right, so that's the other\npart of establishing that trusted\n\n393\n00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:02.640\ncommunication knowing who it\nis you're talking to first.\n\n394\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.290\nAll right, now the next thing that happens\nwhen you use this type of service or\n\n395\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.800\nthis communication between your\nsoftware on your computer and\n\n396\n00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.870\nconnecting to that website.\n\n397\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.900\nIf you will, is going to be the fact\nthat the information itself\n\n398\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.010\nis scrambled in a way that if somebody\nelse is trying to see that conversation,\n\n399\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.360\nthey really don't know what it is.\n\n400\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.350\nThey can't really tell what that\ninformation is because it provides\n\n401\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.500\nsomething known as encryption.\n\n402\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.150\nJust think about it as a way to take\nyour communication between you and\n\n403\n00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.360\nmyself and we scramble it up, and\n\n404\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.520\nwe jumble it up in a way that only you and\nI can understand it.\n\n405\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.130\nIf anybody else is looking at that\ncommunication what I'm talking which\n\n406\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.775\nmight be still the case anyways,\n\n407\n00:22:46.775 --> 00:22:50.610\n[LAUGH] here's the fact that it just\nlooks like a bunch of noise to them.\n\n408\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.277\nWell, that's the benefit of\nthis communications style.\n\n409\n00:22:53.277 --> 00:22:57.266\nSo, if you are connecting to\nsomething important when you're\n\n410\n00:22:57.266 --> 00:23:01.493\nbrowsing I highly recommend making\nsure that websites are HTTPS.\n\n411\n00:23:01.493 --> 00:23:04.880\nLet me give you an example\nhere of this very aspect.\n\n412\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.140\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nlaunch up Bank of Americas website.\n\n413\n00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.140\nThis is just one I happen to use all the\ntime and I would really like to show you.\n\n414\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.110\nAll right, notice that it tells me right\nhere Bank of America Corporation it\n\n415\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.990\nsays your connection to\nthis site is private.\n\n416\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.740\nRemember that I told you that that's just\na communication now between my computer,\n\n417\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.920\nmyself, if you will.\n\n418\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.627\nAnd their web server,\nessentially, their computer.\n\n419\n00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:29.880\nWell how do I know it's safe?\n\n420\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.880\nWell if I choose details, all right,\nit's gonna tell me, remember I told you\n\n421\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.090\nabout that identification, that driver's\nlicense it's telling me that It's valid.\n\n422\n00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.172\nAgain, that's like saying that my drivers\nlicense isn't suspended, it isn't revoked,\n\n423\n00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:47.622\nit hasn't expired, but It's good and valid\nand if I happen to have to give it to\n\n424\n00:23:47.622 --> 00:23:51.340\na representative as a identification of\nlaw enforcement as well, they trust it.\n\n425\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.100\nWell, it's the same thing\nwith this identifier here.\n\n426\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.834\nThis little certificate that I've been\ncalling a drivers license, really,\n\n427\n00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:01.751\nis a little digital code that identifies\nthat this is Bank of America's website.\n\n428\n00:24:01.751 --> 00:24:07.288\nAnd if I need to see if I can trust that\nidentity, that driver's license, right?\n\n429\n00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:10.111\nAll I got to do, is view it.\n\n430\n00:24:10.111 --> 00:24:12.822\nVery easy way, that you can keep in mind,\n\n431\n00:24:12.822 --> 00:24:15.850\non how you can find out\nif you really wanted to.\n\n432\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.770\nYou don't have to.\n\n433\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.900\nYou can make it as simple as possible.\n\n434\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.727\nJust make sure that when you connect,\nup there in that web browser,\n\n435\n00:24:23.727 --> 00:24:26.447\nlike we did over here, it says HTTPS.\n\n436\n00:24:26.447 --> 00:24:28.920\nAll right, so that's one of the ways.\n\n437\n00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.052\nThe other thing that you can do very\nbasically is implementing things\n\n438\n00:24:32.052 --> 00:24:33.084\nlike pop up blockers.\n\n439\n00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:37.240\nPop up blockers, as your browsing,\nthey like to put advertisements.\n\n440\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.930\nAnd even clicking on these\nadvertisements trying to close them out,\n\n441\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.850\nmight redirect you to other locations.\n\n442\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.435\nOne of the good things you can also do is\nmake sure that the websites that you go\n\n443\n00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:47.229\nto are trusted.\n\n444\n00:24:47.229 --> 00:24:50.330\nAll right,\nI know that I'm going to Google's website.\n\n445\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.830\nI trust them.\n\n446\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.340\nI don't know what's going on in\nthe background but I can see https.\n\n447\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.200\nI know in combination with that\nthat this is a valid website and\n\n448\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.840\nit's a website that I trust.\n\n449\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.370\nNow, if it's a website that\ndoesn't have HTTPS, and\n\n450\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.370\nI don't know what it is,\nI do run a risk of\n\n451\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.270\nit potentially being something that\ncould cause me a security issue.\n\n452\n00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.355\nSo we can do that as well.\n\n453\n00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:12.371\nAnd that's really, I would say Ronnie,\n\n454\n00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.200\nsome of the big things we need\nto worry bout with browsing.\n\n455\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.720\nTrust the sites that you're going to.\n\n456\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.640\nMake sure they're using\nsecure communications.\n\n457\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, Wes.\n\n458\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.565\nWe also need to talk What about\nthe different types of anti-viruses\n\n459\n00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:24.205\nthat are out there.\n\n460\n00:25:24.205 --> 00:25:27.365\nWhat does it really help us to do\non our computers as far as basic\n\n461\n00:25:27.365 --> 00:25:28.595\ncomputing security?\n\n462\n00:25:28.595 --> 00:25:33.495\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so when I talk about\nmalicious websites, we'll use that,\n\n463\n00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:35.865\nsince we're already in that realm anyways.\n\n464\n00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:38.795\nIf I go to a website,\nthere's nothing that says,\n\n465\n00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:44.360\nthat when they deliver,\nwhen I see that webpage in the browser but\n\n466\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:49.800\nthat information that's being sent back\nto my computer has to be legitimate.\n\n467\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.360\nIt can be unauthorized\nmalicious information.\n\n468\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.580\nAnd because of that, this malicious\ninformation, this little bit of software\n\n469\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.210\nprogramming, could get and make its way\nonto my computer through my browser.\n\n470\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.680\nAnd it can start to corrupt my files.\n\n471\n00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.060\nThat's basically kinda\nlike what a virus is.\n\n472\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.900\nIt finds a method to\nget into your computer.\n\n473\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.550\nLike a virus needs a host to survive,\nso do viruses out there on the web.\n\n474\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.080\nThey can come in many different forms.\n\n475\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.507\nThey can come in many different avenues.\n\n476\n00:26:20.507 --> 00:26:22.170\nHow you get them.\n\n477\n00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.710\nSo that's why it is important to\n\n478\n00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.470\nhave a pretty good what's\nknown as antivirus software.\n\n479\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.860\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you that right here.\n\n480\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.320\nWe've got one built in to Windows,\nbeen around there for a while.\n\n481\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.360\nThere's also third-party ones there,\nand those third-party ones are great.\n\n482\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.730\nJust happen to show you that most of your\noperating systems today, including Windows\n\n483\n00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.210\nbeing one of them, come with some level\nof defense built right into them.\n\n484\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:48.710\nTo handle some of these viruses so\nI'm gonna change the view up here and\n\n485\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.018\nwe're gonna go to.\n\n486\n00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:52.240\nLet me see,\nI know that's hard to see that there guys.\n\n487\n00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.863\nIf you can see that right there,\nWindows Defender.\n\n488\n00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:58.050\nAll right, Windows Defender is\na form of anti-virus if you will.\n\n489\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:02.140\nAnti-malware, let me just clarify some\nterms that I keep throwing out thinking\n\n490\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.900\nyou guys might understand them,\nlet me explain it.\n\n491\n00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.480\nViruses are under an umbrella\nterm called malware.\n\n492\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.850\nMalware is just code that causes some\nundesired effect on your machine,\n\n493\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.430\nand unauthorized.\n\n494\n00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.480\nA virus happens to be a form of malware.\n\n495\n00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.030\nAnd there's all different kinds.\n\n496\n00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.770\nWe could go into a whole two\nhours on the different kinds.\n\n497\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.250\nBut we just want to focus on\nthe viruses here right now.\n\n498\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.840\nNow, an antivirus software.\n\n499\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.850\nWhat is does is it uses\na Series of definitions.\n\n500\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.850\nWhat's a definition?\n\n501\n00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.320\nI want you to think of your dictionary.\n\n502\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.640\nOr even more so,\nlet's think of a picture book.\n\n503\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.920\nI love books with a lot of pictures.\n\n504\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.965\nIt's easier for me to read.\n\n505\n00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:49.230\n[LAUGH] And I need to know\nwhat an elephant looks like.\n\n506\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.600\nI need to know what a dog or\nwhat a cat looks like or\n\n507\n00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.600\nwhat an exotic type of bird looks like and\nI have no clue, I've never seen it.\n\n508\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.900\nWell, what do I gotta do?\n\n509\n00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.120\nI gotta go find a place for a definition\nof that let's say exotic bird or\n\n510\n00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.640\nI need to find a picture.\n\n511\n00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.780\nAnd what is the definition and\n\n512\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.550\nthe picture maybe even two\nof those combined do for me?\n\n513\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.209\nIt identifies what I'm looking for.\n\n514\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.360\nAny virus is the same way, so\nwhen I say these definitions and\n\n515\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.940\nit's telling me that there are new and\nI know there are new definitions,\n\n516\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.970\nI just wanted you guys to see\nthis because it's also important,\n\n517\n00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:27.660\na definition defines exactly\nwhat a virus looks like.\n\n518\n00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.220\nSo when we run an anti virus scan,\nessentially what we are doing is saying,\n\n519\n00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.950\nlook in the areas across\nthe computing platform.\n\n520\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.070\nFor these pieces of unauthorized software\nthat have now potentially made their\n\n521\n00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.670\nway on our computer and are causing\nsome kinda, again I say unauthorized,\n\n522\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.630\nundesired effect, and could corrupt our\nsystems and cause a lot of problems.\n\n523\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.790\nSo remember that with\nyour antivirus software,\n\n524\n00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.390\nyou have some that are built in,\nyou have third-party.\n\n525\n00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.800\nBut what you really wanna make sure\nis that they have what I believe,\n\n526\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.620\nif I remember right,\nlet me get into the options here.\n\n527\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.860\nYeah, there we go.\n\n528\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.890\nAnd administrator.\n\n529\n00:29:07.072 --> 00:29:12.260\nLet's see, real time protection,\nright there, all most bit me.\n\n530\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.470\nIs make sure that it has this right here.\n\n531\n00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:19.590\nReal time protection, cuz that's means\nit's actively searching your computer.\n\n532\n00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.610\nJust like it says, in real time,\nit's running in the background right now.\n\n533\n00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.503\nIt's trying to check to see if\nI have anything on my computer.\n\n534\n00:29:26.503 --> 00:29:30.688\nAll right, the other thing that\nI will tell you to is run scans.\n\n535\n00:29:30.688 --> 00:29:31.407\nAll right?\n\n536\n00:29:31.407 --> 00:29:33.010\nScan your computers.\n\n537\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.920\nThey have a few different\ntypes of scans here.\n\n538\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.310\nYou can see Quick, Full, and Custom.\n\n539\n00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.497\nI’ll take a second here and\ntell you what those are,\n\n540\n00:29:39.497 --> 00:29:44.796\nQuick common locations that Microsoft has\nstudied and know that viruses are located.\n\n541\n00:29:44.796 --> 00:29:48.800\nFull scan, guys exactly what it sounds\nlike you guys are very bright out there.\n\n542\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.410\nFull scan means let’s\nlook at the whole system.\n\n543\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.080\nThe custom scan is kinda tricky here.\n\n544\n00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.867\nThe custom scan says,\nlet's perform a quick scan, and\n\n545\n00:29:56.867 --> 00:29:59.076\nthen any additional place that you choose.\n\n546\n00:29:59.076 --> 00:29:59.679\nRight?\n\n547\n00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:02.430\nSo you don't have to do the full scan, and\nthat's why they call it a custom scan.\n\n548\n00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.200\nKeep in mind, it still does a quick scan.\n\n549\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.770\nThose commonalities, those common places\nthat these pieces of bugs, if you will,\n\n550\n00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:09.770\nviruses live.\n\n551\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.853\nAnd then anything else\nthat you might check.\n\n552\n00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:16.555\nAll right Ronnie, so you know when\nit comes down to, again I said this,\n\n553\n00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:19.480\nbut remember that there\nare also third party software.\n\n554\n00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.750\nWhen you get a third party software,\n\n555\n00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.385\na lot of times that company's focused on\nthat one thing, when you get them built\n\n556\n00:30:26.385 --> 00:30:29.695\ninto the operating system it is just nice\nto have something going out the gate so\n\n557\n00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:32.885\nyou're not left wide open with these\nsecurity vulnerabilities the moment\n\n558\n00:30:32.885 --> 00:30:34.735\nyou turn your computer on\nthe first time you get it.\n\n559\n00:30:34.735 --> 00:30:38.960\nSo it is good to have them built into the\noperating system but there's nothing wrong\n\n560\n00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.790\nwith going out and purchasing\na subscription based antivirus software.\n\n561\n00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.650\nMake sure you're running one,\nand make sure it's turned on.\n\n562\n00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.619\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nwe have a few minutes left, but\n\n563\n00:30:48.619 --> 00:30:51.450\nlets talk about the idea\nof just the firewall.\n\n564\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.880\nMost people that are going to use\ncomputers are going to hear about\n\n565\n00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.310\nthe idea of a firewall protection.\n\n566\n00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.550\nWhat does that really mean for\na company and a user in particular?\n\n567\n00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n568\n00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.450\nThis is kinda like\nthe gatekeeper to communications\n\n569\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.560\nfrom your computer and to your computer.\n\n570\n00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:15.230\nThere's no guarantee that any\ncommunication, when you visit a website,\n\n571\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.180\nwhen you transfer a file,\nthere really isn't any guarantee, or\n\n572\n00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.940\nwhen a program talks and\nyou don't even know it's happening.\n\n573\n00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.580\nWhen it receives a communication back,\nthere's no guarantee.\n\n574\n00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:31.240\nThere isn't a guarantee that that isn't\ngonna be some type of malicious activity.\n\n575\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.275\nSo wouldn't it be nice to put\na gate keeper right in the middle\n\n576\n00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:41.827\nthat says only the things that I\ntell you can talk to me are allowed?\n\n577\n00:31:41.827 --> 00:31:44.500\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat a firewall does.\n\n578\n00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:51.120\nIt blocks the communications coming into\nto your computer unless you say kinda\n\n579\n00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.360\nlike maybe the bouncer, if you will, says,\nyep that's good, you can go on through.\n\n580\n00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.861\nSo the firewall blocks communications\ncoming into your computer and it says,\n\n581\n00:32:00.861 --> 00:32:04.215\nnope, you don't get through\nunless you gotta hall pass.\n\n582\n00:32:04.215 --> 00:32:06.750\nAnd the hall pass is what\nwe call an exception.\n\n583\n00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:12.084\nI want to think of exceptions as being\nthe rule says nobody gets through.\n\n584\n00:32:12.084 --> 00:32:15.276\nExcept whatever is on the list, right?\n\n585\n00:32:15.276 --> 00:32:18.786\nLet me show you the firewall here\nif we go into system and security,\n\n586\n00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:20.300\ngo to the Windows firewall.\n\n587\n00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.680\nNot network location,\nlet's try that again.\n\n588\n00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.910\nJust a bit outside ball one, there we go.\n\n589\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.270\nThis is our Windows firewall,\nall right, and\n\n590\n00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.810\nnotice that we have an option\nto allow a program or\n\n591\n00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:37.240\nfeature through the firewall and\nthese are some of the built in programs.\n\n592\n00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.640\nNotice that we don't have\ncheck marks in all of these\n\n593\n00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.870\nbecause this says only what you allow.\n\n594\n00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:50.150\nNow, by default, Windows says what we need\nto keep the operating system functional,\n\n595\n00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.550\nis going to be allowed.\n\n596\n00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.579\nBut then, anything outside\nof that basic functionality,\n\n597\n00:32:54.579 --> 00:32:58.152\nyou're gonna have to get in here,\nand you're gonna have to say okay,\n\n598\n00:32:58.152 --> 00:33:02.269\nwell I want somebody to be able to connect\nto this machine from an Olo location, so\n\n599\n00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:06.142\nI need to allow, I need a gatekeeper,\nI need to make that gatekeeper aware,\n\n600\n00:33:06.142 --> 00:33:09.860\nput him in the list, if you see\nthis come in, I wanna talk to it.\n\n601\n00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.260\nAnd we go ahead and\nenable something like remote desktop, and\n\n602\n00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.510\nnow in that piece of software, here is\ncommunication coming in to your computer,\n\n603\n00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.400\nit says yep, let it by, I see it's\nright here on the list, it's allowed.\n\n604\n00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.050\nBut what happens if the attacker out there\nis trying to send information that's not\n\n605\n00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.380\non this list?\n\n606\n00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.905\nIt means the firewall says I see\nthat information, is it on the list?\n\n607\n00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:32.640\nNow let's go ahead and\n\n608\n00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.290\ncompletely discard access tonight and\nit helps to protect your computer.\n\n609\n00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.140\nSo, that in a nutshell is it\njust remember the exceptions\n\n610\n00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.360\nno communications except\nwhat you see in the list.\n\n611\n00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.190\nAll right Wes, so any last minute\ncomments here on the basics of security.\n\n612\n00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.930\n&gt;&gt; There's one other thing\nthat I do want to mention.\n\n613\n00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.140\nAnd we've already pretty\nmuch touch based on it but\n\n614\n00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.316\nI do want to mention in\nthe context of e-commerce.\n\n615\n00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:59.550\nE-commerce is the worldwide\nbusiness that we are a part of.\n\n616\n00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.630\nThings like selling and buying and even,\nif you will, logging into things like your\n\n617\n00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.330\nbank accounts and they want you\nto know how to keep that secure.\n\n618\n00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.470\nWell, the same thing we talked\nabout in our browsing habits,\n\n619\n00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:15.360\nmaking them secure using HTTPS so\nyou know who you're communicating with\n\n620\n00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.990\nis the way that you can keep\ne-commerce safe as well.\n\n621\n00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.590\nKeep in mind it scrambles that\ninformation, you can validate who it is\n\n622\n00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.540\nthat you're talking to so you can ensure\nthat people on the outside, if they're not\n\n623\n00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.630\nsupposed to have information, they\ndon't have access to that information.\n\n624\n00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.977\nSo again remember, e-commerce,\nHTTPS, secure communications,\n\n625\n00:34:33.977 --> 00:34:36.190\nthat's the way you go.\n\n626\n00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:40.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great place\nfor us to also end this episode then.\n\n627\n00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:44.220\nSigning off from ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n628\n00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.182\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n629\n00:34:45.182 --> 00:34:49.303\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore IC3 computing fundamentals.\n\n630\n00:34:49.303 --> 00:34:56.289\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode Episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:17.526\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:22.670\nin today's episode we're moving forward\nwith our IC3 computer fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.620\nJoining me in the studio today is our\ngood friend, our mentor mister Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.030\nWes welcome back sir how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here.\n\n9\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.160\nThat's right in computing fundamentals\none of the things we still have yet\n\n10\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.660\nto tackle is troubleshooting and\n\n11\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about the\ntroubleshooting inside of Windows when it\n\n12\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.780\ncomes to different software situations\nthat you might come across.\n\n13\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.010\nThen, I'm also going to mix in\na little bit of hardware as well.\n\n14\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.900\nKeep in mind that if you are going\nobjective by objective for\n\n15\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.850\nthe IC3 computing fundamentals exam,\nit does technically fall under software.\n\n16\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.980\nBut when it comes down to it, what\nare we troubleshooting a lot of times in\n\n17\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.760\nsoftware, is none than\nour our hardware too.\n\n18\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.500\nSo, you're gonna see that there's really\ngonna be a blending of the two and\n\n19\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.870\nwe're just gonna look at some of\nthe common things that you might face\n\n20\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230\ninside of your environment when\nit comes to trouble shooting.\n\n21\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.631\nSo, got a list here and\nwe're gonna kinda talk about this list.\n\n22\n00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:13.332\nWhen it comes to trouble shooting these\nare some of the things that you could\n\n23\n00:01:13.332 --> 00:01:15.165\npotentially see and let's make it.\n\n24\n00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.520\nAnd speaking of seeing,\nlet's make it a little bit easier to see.\n\n25\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.359\nUAC settings, we talked about in prior\nepisodes of the User Account Control,\n\n26\n00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.684\nwe will mention some things might\nhappen here, but let's go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:28.730\ngo to this list.\n\n28\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.700\nCompatibility, compatibility in general,\nwhen it comes to\n\n29\n00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.680\nyour operating system versus the software\nthat runs on the operating system, and\n\n30\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.980\nthere are certain things that\nyou have to be aware of there.\n\n31\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.670\nArchitecture, right?\n\n32\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.720\nWe talked about the fact\nthat there's 32 bit, 64 bit,\n\n33\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.250\nand even ARM based technologies for\nlike your mobile devices.\n\n34\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.500\nAnd that this might be something\nthat you have to consider as well.\n\n35\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.670\nAnd really, I could've probably lumped\nthat under compatibility too because it\n\n36\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.470\nreally boils down to architecture.\n\n37\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.550\nArchitecture might not be compatible\nwith the operating system that you have\n\n38\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.700\ncurrently installed on your machine.\n\n39\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.740\nBackup and restore.\n\n40\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.880\nWe're gonna talk about some of the things\nthat you need to make sure that you verify\n\n41\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.460\nthat we did have an episode\nabout backup and restoration.\n\n42\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.390\nIf you haven't seen that episode jump\nback and take a look at that and\n\n43\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.930\nthen you can come back here and\n\n44\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.730\nwe'll talk about some of the things\nthat you just need to be aware of\n\n45\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.900\nwhen it comes to backup and restoration or\nbackup and restore in this case.\n\n46\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.980\nAnd then everybody's favorite topic\nuntil they have to deal with it,\n\n47\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.860\nthe legendary BSOD or\nthe blue screen of death.\n\n48\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.404\nI won't talk about a couple of\nthe things that might come up if\n\n49\n00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:38.316\nyou should have the luxury of\nseeing one of those fun adventures.\n\n50\n00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:42.350\nCouple other things that I wanna talk\nabout, too slow application response times\n\n51\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.269\nbecause you've probably had an application\nthat you tried to launch before and\n\n52\n00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:46.870\nwho knows?\n\n53\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.586\nMaybe when you launch the application,\nyou decided,\n\n54\n00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.713\nhey I can get a cup of coffee,\ncome back and then when I get back,\n\n55\n00:02:52.713 --> 00:02:55.992\nwhatever I've clicked on will\nactually be open and ready for me.\n\n56\n00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:57.510\nWe'll also talk about that,\n\n57\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.520\nwe'll also talk about an application\nmaybe that is unresponsive.\n\n58\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.750\nSome of the utilities that you guys have\ninside of your operating system that\n\n59\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.808\nwe want to make you aware of,\nthere's a few of them here.\n\n60\n00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:14.010\nOne of the very first ones, again and\nyou guys have probably seen\n\n61\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.300\nof these in our configuration episode,\nthe task manager.\n\n62\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.780\nReliability Monitor,\n\n63\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.360\nPerformance Monitor is in there,\nResource Monitor, Backup and Restore.\n\n64\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.799\nAnd yes, I did put Windows Explorer\nin there for the fact that, well,\n\n65\n00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.966\nthings like Chkdisk and\n\n66\n00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:31.836\nDisk Cleanup, we can actually launch\nthose from inside of Windows Explorer.\n\n67\n00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.452\nRemember that your file and\n\n68\n00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:37.746\nfolder management utility that we've\ntalked about in prior episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:43.661\nMS config this is good for the purposes\nof diagnosing a start up problems.\n\n70\n00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.216\nSo, it is a good thing to have on\nthe list as well and then we also have\n\n71\n00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:51.490\ndevice manager and you know am gonna go\nahead and am gonna put an extra one there.\n\n72\n00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.081\nDan I notice that I did kinda\nleave one out that is very,\n\n73\n00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:59.844\nvery good to have too and that's\nsomething known as the Event Viewer, so\n\n74\n00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:02.830\nwe'll go ahead and\nput that one up there too.\n\n75\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.260\nI didn't miss that one.\n\n76\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.490\nBut we wouldn't be doing you any justice\nif we didn't talk about Event Viewer cuz\n\n77\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.570\nthat can be one of the starting points\nthat you go to if you will when it comes\n\n78\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.590\nto utilities to find out other things\nthat are going on inside of your system.\n\n79\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.690\nSo, that being said, let's go ahead and we\nwill start back over from the beginning.\n\n80\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.440\nNo, just kidding.\n\n81\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.340\nBut we are gonna talk about some of\nthe things that you might encounter and\n\n82\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.400\nlet's start with the User Account Control.\n\n83\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.530\nAll right, now, if you'll remember in some\nof the things, or in the previous episode,\n\n84\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.680\nwe talked about User Account Control\nbeing a security implementation\n\n85\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.740\nthat started back in Vista.\n\n86\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.380\nThings like Apple operating systems and\nLinux had already been using this type of\n\n87\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.860\nsecurity model before Windows ever started\nto employ it in their, or Microsoft,\n\n88\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.650\nI guess I should say, started to employ\nit into implement it inside of windows.\n\n89\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.180\nAnd this is the fact that you\nhave an administrative user and\n\n90\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.070\nyou have standard users, right?\n\n91\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.800\nAnd like I said in the Unix world,\nNix world, Linux,\n\n92\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.590\nthey've had root user versus\na standard user for a long time.\n\n93\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.900\nBut in that transition from Vista\nto Windows 7 this became more and\n\n94\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.500\nmore popular in the Windows environment\nthat it could cause problems and\n\n95\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.510\nwe wanna know a little bit about that.\n\n96\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.180\nAll right, so let me go ahead, I'm gonna\ndrop down to my Windows machine here.\n\n97\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.400\nAnd I wanna show you what I'm\ntalking about, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.440\nNow when we talk about for instance\nthe User Account Control, let's see,\n\n99\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.510\nI believe I'm in\nthe administrative account.\n\n100\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.370\nTell you what, let me go and\nlog off here real quick,\n\n101\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.680\nI wanna show you this from the perspective\nof a standard user and you see just like\n\n102\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.010\nin past episodes, we got a couple of\nusers here and we're gonna go head.\n\n103\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.785\nWe're gonna use User02 here cuz I believe,\nif I remember right,\n\n104\n00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.252\nthat was a standard user.\n\n105\n00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:44.966\nWe'll let it go ahead and\nprepare our desktop and boom, there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:49.848\nAll right, now, with a standard users,\nthere are some limitations\n\n107\n00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:54.070\nsome of the things that the UAC\nwill effect you, all right?\n\n108\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.620\nAnd what I mean by that is\nstandard users can't install\n\n109\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.610\ncertain types of applications.\n\n110\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.408\nApplications that only affect their\nuser themselves, they can install and\n\n111\n00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:04.545\nthey can run, right?\n\n112\n00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:09.986\nSo, if I have an application and\nDan's also got an account on this system.\n\n113\n00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:13.862\nI install it and it doesn't do anything\nto his settings, doesn't do anything to\n\n114\n00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:17.900\nthe core functionality of the operating\nsystem or key security settings.\n\n115\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.760\nI can run it just fine.\n\n116\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.280\nHowever, if it's an application that\ncan make changes to core functionality.\n\n117\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.240\nAnd when I say that I'm\ntalking about that registry,\n\n118\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.112\nstart modifying settings and stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:31.040\nYou're gonna have to be\nan administrative user,\n\n120\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.750\nso that could be\nthe end-user's experience.\n\n121\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.850\nI also mentioned that it also effects\nthe standard user's ability to run certain\n\n122\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.420\napplications.\n\n123\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.530\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n124\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.640\nWe're gonna go ahead we're\ngonna to the Start button.\n\n125\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.690\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel,\nwe're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n126\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.690\nWe're gonna drop down here, guys,\nto Administrative Tools, and\n\n127\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.930\nwe're gonna launch one of these\nAdministrative Tools here.\n\n128\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.463\nAnd let me see if I could find the one\nthat I think might trigger the UAC.\n\n129\n00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:58.480\nThis might not trigger the UAC,\nthe Local Security.\n\n130\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.529\nBut I tell you what, there's couple\nother places that I know that it will,\n\n131\n00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.940\nnotice that it's says we got system for\ninstance here.\n\n132\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.430\nNotice this little shield that's\nnext to Allow Remote Access,\n\n133\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.930\nall right it's a standard user, if I\nclick that, notice what's happening here,\n\n134\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.030\nthe User Account Control is coming up,\nit's completely blocking my\n\n135\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.920\nability as a standard user to even do that\nunless I have an administrator password.\n\n136\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.720\nNow in this case,\nguys let's open up the curtains there, so\n\n137\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.420\nyou could see the man that's running\nall the gears behind the scene.\n\n138\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.080\nI could put the administrator password,\nI know in here, but if you had a standard\n\n139\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.530\nuser that didn't know that password,\nessentially they can't run this software.\n\n140\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.320\nSo, there are certain types of security\nsoftware that this can cause problems.\n\n141\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.790\nSo, how do we troubleshoot this?\n\n142\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.435\nLog in as an administrator and\nsee if you can run that software.\n\n143\n00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:48.158\nIf you can run that software as an\nadministrator, then chances are depending\n\n144\n00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:51.421\non the role that the user,\nthe standard user plays in your company,\n\n145\n00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:54.304\nyou might not want them using\nthat software or maybe you do.\n\n146\n00:07:54.304 --> 00:07:57.361\nSo, if you do want them to use that\nsoftware How do we go about and\n\n147\n00:07:57.361 --> 00:07:59.633\nchange that so\nthey can get into that setting?\n\n148\n00:07:59.633 --> 00:08:04.444\nWell, that's a place that we go and that's\ntypically if we back out of our control\n\n149\n00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:08.210\npanel here, we can go over the user\naccount and family safety and\n\n150\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.630\nwhen we get into here, there's another\nlocation and it's kind of funny.\n\n151\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.000\nI don't think it's gonna let me see\nthis so I'll be to go ahead and\n\n152\n00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.838\nput in my administrative credentials again\ncuz anywhere you see a shield In these\n\n153\n00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:24.310\nhyper-links that we've talked about\nbefore, these little task links, requires\n\n154\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.442\nan administrative password in order to\nreally work with that functionality.\n\n155\n00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust elevate myself here, my privileges.\n\n156\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.960\nNow, here's something\nthat I want you to see.\n\n157\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.620\nThis is the user account control.\n\n158\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.840\nIf I didn't want people to have\nthis problem, standard users,\n\n159\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.550\nI could also, I can say never notify.\n\n160\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:50.250\nNow, I want you to be careful on this one\nthough because the UAC has some good,\n\n161\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.480\ngood purposes.\n\n162\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.420\nIf you're in Linux, if you're\ngonna run a command that requires\n\n163\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.720\nadministrative level or root privileges\nas they call it, super user privileges,\n\n164\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.090\nyou don't just run the command inside\nof the terminal and it just executes.\n\n165\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.480\nWhat happens and it says you get either\nlike an access denied or you don't\n\n166\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.560\nhave the user doesn't have the sufficient\nprivileges but it does block you.\n\n167\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.920\nAnd that's a good thing because you don't\nwanna make it these inadvertent changes\n\n168\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.350\nthat causes a system instability and\nit's the same thing here in Windows.\n\n169\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.590\nIf I turn this off I'm essentially\ncrippling Windows Security.\n\n170\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.570\nSo whether you do that or\nwant to do that or not is up to you.\n\n171\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.460\nBut if you're ever troubleshooting that,\nmaybe you're on a home environment,\n\n172\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.110\nyou've got somebody that you wanna be\nable to use a certain piece of software.\n\n173\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.100\nThis is one of the places\nthat you could do that.\n\n174\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.990\nSo keep in mind if the user\naccount control becomes a problem,\n\n175\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.030\ntypically what the issue is gonna be\nis that it's a non administrative or\n\n176\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.390\nwhat we call standard user inside of\nthe Windows environment that doesn't have\n\n177\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.970\nthose privileges and it's blocking them\nfrom completed in the functionality.\n\n178\n00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.890\nLikewise, if he was\nan administrator install a piece of\n\n179\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.830\nsoftware make it available to everybody\nand they try to run it, it's available.\n\n180\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.030\nThey can see it on the start menu and\nit tries to make like a change down into\n\n181\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.200\nthe settings of Windows or into a security\nsetting, it's gonna stop running for\n\n182\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.770\nthem and it's gonna give them\nthat same dialog box, in there.\n\n183\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.980\nIt's just something that you have to plan\nout, kind of have a strategy in place for\n\n184\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.940\nif you're gonna allow non administrative\nversus administrative users.\n\n185\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.660\nThe next one I wanna mention here\non the list is well compatibility.\n\n186\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.920\nAnd I meant to put\ncompatibility in general.\n\n187\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.140\nI'll tell you why I ended up\ntyping compatibility mode.\n\n188\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.460\nBecause that's actually the fix.\n\n189\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.215\nI gave you the problem and\nthe solution all in one line.\n\n190\n00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:36.310\n[LAUGH] Compatibility.\n\n191\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.770\nThis is becoming less and\nless of an issue today because this was\n\n192\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.300\nreally something that was\non the break of XP and\n\n193\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.860\nVista coming up well in the days\nof XP their security model.\n\n194\n00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.430\nIf you well didn't have\nthis administrative verses\n\n195\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.000\nnon administrative user in fact let me\na little more specific they did have it.\n\n196\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.090\nBut the problem is very few people ever\nused it right it was until Vista and\n\n197\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.540\nthen here in Windows seven\nthat they enforced it and\n\n198\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.080\nthey said now you will\nfollow this security model.\n\n199\n00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.600\nSo what does that have\nto do with the software?\n\n200\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.230\nYou got to understand that certain pieces\nof software might have compatibility\n\n201\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.320\nissues because they might not understand\nwhat the user account control even is.\n\n202\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.280\nThey're expecting to make a certain\nmodification to the operating system and\n\n203\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.120\nwhen they don't get that ability,\nit breaks the program causes some\n\n204\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.132\nkind of runtime effect that just we don't,\nmaybe breaks the functionality.\n\n205\n00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:38.800\nSo again, with the compatibility like\nthis that's directly related to the UAC.\n\n206\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.161\nKeep in mind that it can affect\nprograms ability to run.\n\n207\n00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:46.182\nNow, when it comes to\nthe software in general,\n\n208\n00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:52.020\nhere's I want you to keep in mind,\nupdate your software.\n\n209\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.390\nRun updated software.\n\n210\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.250\nIf you think you might have\na compatibility problem,\n\n211\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.560\na lot of times the vendors,\nthey want their software to be running\n\n212\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.100\non operating system so\npeople either purchase it or download it.\n\n213\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.130\nSo a lot of times,\nthey work with the manufacturers.\n\n214\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.250\nThey work with the software providers to\nensure that their software does work.\n\n215\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.440\nSo make sure that you update it.\n\n216\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.423\nYou might have roll ups.\n\n217\n00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:13.980\nAnd I'm not talking about fruited\ncandy here guys, sorry about that.\n\n218\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.890\nThe roll up I'm talking about is a set\n\n219\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.110\nof cumulative updates that\nare applied to a piece of software.\n\n220\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.770\nAnd it might give you\nthe functionality that was\n\n221\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.340\nmaybe lacking when it was first deployed\nto the new instance of that software or\n\n222\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.000\nthat operating system\nthat it's running on.\n\n223\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.754\nCheck your manufacturer's website for\ncompatibility.\n\n224\n00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:39.573\nIf I wanna find out if a piece of software\nwill run on an operating system that I'm\n\n225\n00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:43.960\ncurrently using I can typically go the\nmanufacturer's website and I can find out.\n\n226\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.960\nWell, this is available for Windows.\n\n227\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.398\nNot only just is it available for\nWindows, it is available for Windows,\n\n228\n00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:54.716\nmaybe Windows 7, Windows 8,\n8.1 and now today in Windows 10.\n\n229\n00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:57.828\nIt's also available for\nLinux it might say.\n\n230\n00:12:57.828 --> 00:12:59.890\nIs it available for Mac?\n\n231\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.990\nIs it available for\n64 bit versus 32 bit which kind of\n\n232\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.840\nlends itself to architecture, so We'll\nprobably get a blend notice together.\n\n233\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.130\nAgain, keep in mind that a 32 bit piece\nof software can run on a 64 bit machine,\n\n234\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.900\nbut you try to reverse those roles and\n\n235\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.040\nput a 64 bit application on a 32\nbit machine, no food for you.\n\n236\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.690\nDon't got, well it's not gonna work.\n\n237\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.100\nIt just won't work that way.\n\n238\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.370\nSo the other thing you can do,\nI know it's kinda obvious guys so\n\n239\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.320\nwe're not trying to insult\nanybody's intelligence.\n\n240\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.760\nRun a compatible application.\n\n241\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.040\nI know that seems obvious guys, but\nto some people it might not be so obvious.\n\n242\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.130\nI've been running this\npiece of software and\n\n243\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.460\nworked fine on XP,\nwhy should I have to change it?\n\n244\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.130\nWell, you might have to change it,\nyou might have to adapt with the new.\n\n245\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.270\nAnd I know by now you\nshouldn't be on XP anymore.\n\n246\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.784\nBut again, these issues still come\nup because some of the older systems\n\n247\n00:13:51.784 --> 00:13:54.870\nare still widely supported or\nused I should say,\n\n248\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.746\nregardless of whether there support forum.\n\n249\n00:13:57.746 --> 00:14:00.623\nLet me show you another thing,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n250\n00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:03.310\nwe'll go back down to our machine here.\n\n251\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.810\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead real quick\njust to a fast switch user because\n\n252\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.890\nI'm bit annoyed with UAC\ndepartment administrator.\n\n253\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.531\nI really don't wanna see it and it has\nit's purposes I understand that completely\n\n254\n00:14:15.531 --> 00:14:19.836\nbut when I wanna get to some of these\nadministrative utilities I don't wanna\n\n255\n00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:22.795\nhave to keep entering my password and\nconvenient and\n\n256\n00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:25.507\nsecurity sometimes don't\nlay nice together.\n\n257\n00:14:25.507 --> 00:14:28.157\nSo I'm gonna go down to\nthe Administrative Tools and\n\n258\n00:14:28.157 --> 00:14:31.350\nin the administrative tools\nthere's this guy right here that I\n\n259\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.707\nwanna talk about when it comes to software\ncompatibility that's your Event Viewer.\n\n260\n00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:38.270\nSo check event viewer for errors.\n\n261\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.385\nWhen you're looking for compatibility\noption you can always fire up event\n\n262\n00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:46.695\nviewer, and you can get into the Windows\nlogs and I wanna kinda be specific with\n\n263\n00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:50.831\nthis one because you can see there\nare a lot of different types of logs here.\n\n264\n00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:54.601\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna open\nthis one up and I want you to see what I\n\n265\n00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:58.900\ncall really the important three here,\napplication, security and system.\n\n266\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.350\nSystem should be obvious that it is about\nsystem events that are happening within\n\n267\n00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.560\nthe operating system and sometimes\neven related to the hardware failure.\n\n268\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.390\nAs well, or just daily interactions\nbetween the operating system and\n\n269\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.460\nthe hardware.\n\n270\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.860\nHowever, this one I do wanna see.\n\n271\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.910\nAnd I can see that there\nare some warnings here.\n\n272\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.070\nSo I do get the ability that if I go into\nEvent Viewer and I look at the application\n\n273\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.880\nlog, I can look through here and\nmaybe find information that's related.\n\n274\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.760\nHere we got an error.\n\n275\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.900\nLet's see, wmi.\n\n276\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.750\nGod, I love\nWindows Management Instrumentation here.\n\n277\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.821\nThere's all kinds of\nproblems with that and\n\n278\n00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:42.391\nI'm not gonna even try to give you the\nindication that I know what this is about.\n\n279\n00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:46.796\nBut again, I can see that there\nare some issues that are going on.\n\n280\n00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:51.280\nI can see things like volume shadow\ncopy and application notice that it says\n\n281\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.268\nthat shutting down to an I/O time out,\nso I can see\n\n282\n00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:58.991\na lot of information about applications\nincluding errors that might come up.\n\n283\n00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:04.780\nThe other place that you might go,\nand this is also in Windows 7 as well.\n\n284\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.710\nLet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n285\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.220\nIf we go to the Action Center,\nall right, and\n\n286\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.070\nI scroll down and it isn't collapsed\nhere or it's collapsed on itself,\n\n287\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.800\nbut notice there's this\nmaintenance option.\n\n288\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.140\nAnd if I choose this little arrow here\nyou'll see that I can expand that out,\n\n289\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.569\nand then notice this\nview reliability history.\n\n290\n00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:28.947\nThat's very important too when you're\ntalking about software errors, and there's\n\n291\n00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:32.153\nother things that are here to and you will\nprobably see this come up more than once.\n\n292\n00:16:32.153 --> 00:16:36.470\nAgain sometimes this utility can be\nused for more than one application.\n\n293\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.780\nWe view the reliability history and\n\n294\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.670\nI want you to notice that yes I do,\nI can see right here.\n\n295\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.910\nNotice application failures?\n\n296\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.061\nAnd if I look I see application failures,\n\n297\n00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:49.869\nand then if I follow this graph over I\ncan see that I got a couple of errors and\n\n298\n00:16:49.869 --> 00:16:52.838\nI can see their respective\ndates at which they happened.\n\n299\n00:16:52.838 --> 00:16:56.446\nAnd if I decide that I want\nto maybe select one of these,\n\n300\n00:16:56.446 --> 00:17:01.880\nyou can get some information about what\nwas it that actually went on here.\n\n301\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.140\nDan, you have any idea what that\napplication might be there, bud?\n\n302\n00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.330\n&gt;&gt; That's the command prompt right there,\nmy man.\n\n303\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.390\n&gt;&gt; And look at that right there.\n\n304\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.450\nDan just right away, boom.\n\n305\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.480\nI know what application it is in case,\nthis one's kinda easily identifiable.\n\n306\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.790\nSometimes they might have\na more cryptographic name,\n\n307\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.490\nand I'm not talking security, so you\nmight have to do a little bit of research\n\n308\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.090\non what the application is,\nbut he's exactly right.\n\n309\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.865\nThere was something that went on in the\ncommand prompt and it stopped responding.\n\n310\n00:17:26.865 --> 00:17:30.540\nSo this wouldn't I would say necessarily\nbe a compatibility issue but\n\n311\n00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.800\nit is an application issue.\n\n312\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.200\nAnd when we do have things\nlike compatibility issues,\n\n313\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.440\nthese are a couple places you can go.\n\n314\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.540\nNow the other thing that I wanna show\nyou too is what was on the slide or what\n\n315\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.140\nwas on this little diagram that we had and\nthat was called compatibility mode.\n\n316\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.280\nNow Chrome doesn't have a compatibility\nissue with Windows 7 so\n\n317\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.540\nlet me go ahead and preface that.\n\n318\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.560\nBut I do want to show you\nthat if I decided to,\n\n319\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.000\nif I have a program that\nwasn't running appropriately,\n\n320\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.880\nI could always choose this option right\nhere, Troubleshoot compatibility.\n\n321\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.540\nIt might solve the problem,\nit might not solve the problem, but\n\n322\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.700\nat least you have some kind\nof automated approach.\n\n323\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.720\nThat it can gather some information\nabout it, it could put this together and\n\n324\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.720\nsee if it can find a solution for you.\n\n325\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.150\nThe other thing I wanna show you about\ncompatibility is directly related to\n\n326\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.030\nthe Properties option here\non the right-click menu.\n\n327\n00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.910\nYou will notice that there\nis this Compatibility tab.\n\n328\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.560\nAnd let's go ahead and just take\na second and look at that right there.\n\n329\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.299\nWe look at this, maybe,\ncan you see it now?\n\n330\n00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:31.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's see it, Wesley.\n\n331\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n332\n00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:38.865\nSo notice that we have Run this program\nin compatibility mode for such and such.\n\n333\n00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:42.185\nAnd if I put a check mark\non here depending on what\n\n334\n00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:45.320\nthe application is you can say,\nI've actually seen these, believe it or\n\n335\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.839\nnot Dan, go back to Windows 95 and 98, so.\n\n336\n00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:49.582\n&gt;&gt; That's compatibility.\n\n337\n00:18:49.582 --> 00:18:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at that point I would say\nit's probably time to upgrade.\n\n338\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.659\nIf you've got some that still\nruns on MS-DOS subsystem,\n\n339\n00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:57.426\nyeah, you need to upgrade.\n\n340\n00:18:57.426 --> 00:19:02.331\nBut, again, not everybody has the money,\nthe monetary funds if you will,\n\n341\n00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:07.006\nto just start forking out in cash to\nupgrade so this is, I would say this is\n\n342\n00:19:07.006 --> 00:19:11.780\nmore of a kind of like, I don't know,\nit's a Band-Aid over a big wound.\n\n343\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Then you get a Linux system and\nyou're good.\n\n344\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n345\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.490\nWhat do we call a Windows recovery disk?\n\n346\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.570\n&gt;&gt; A Linux Live CD.\n\n347\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.770\n&gt;&gt; So let's go and we'll close that down.\n\n348\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.430\nSo that's one of the other things.\n\n349\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.850\nNow guys I did mention architecture here.\n\n350\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.540\nArchitecture really lends\nitself to compatibility too.\n\n351\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.570\nI just wanted to give its own category so\nthat we know.\n\n352\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.435\nThings like drivers, 32-bit drivers for\n32-bit operating systems.\n\n353\n00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:40.968\n32-bits pieces of software for\n32-bit and 64-bit.\n\n354\n00:19:40.968 --> 00:19:45.280\nAnd that's where it gets a little tricky,\nbecause 64-bit doesn't run on 32-bit.\n\n355\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.480\nAnd the same thing might go if you've\ngot an application that was designed for\n\n356\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.200\nmobile implementation.\n\n357\n00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.580\nIt might only run on devices that\nhave those ARM-based processors.\n\n358\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.530\nAgain, don't worry about\nthe technicalities of ARM-based processor.\n\n359\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.000\nBasically what I'm saying is a mobile\ndevice type processor, again,\n\n360\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.770\nit could be centric to that as well.\n\n361\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.380\nAll right, next one on the list that we\nwanna talk about briefly is backup and\n\n362\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:08.990\nrestore.\n\n363\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.170\nAnd there's a few things that we wanna\nkeep in mind here on what we can do,\n\n364\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.160\nmaybe some of the things\nthat you might come across.\n\n365\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndive back into our operating system.\n\n366\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.600\nNow when I say this keep in mind that\nwe do have an episode that Ronnie and\n\n367\n00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.180\nmyself did that was on backup and\nrestoration.\n\n368\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.340\nBut I do wanna talk about some of the\nthings that you still wanna be aware of\n\n369\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.530\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting,\nall right.\n\n370\n00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.600\nFirst of all, all right,\nschedule backups, all right.\n\n371\n00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.900\nSo if I dive in here and\n\n372\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.440\nI decide that I want to run backups\nI'm gonna push the Start button.\n\n373\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.890\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel, System\nand Security, and about almost all the way\n\n374\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.030\ndown the list remember we've got\nBackup and Restore, all right.\n\n375\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.360\nThat is the first thing\nthat we want to see.\n\n376\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.390\nSo I'm gonna right-click on that and\nI'm gonna choose Open.\n\n377\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.820\nNow, one of the things that\nyou're gonna notice here is that,\n\n378\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.360\nwell, notice this option here.\n\n379\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.840\nFirst of all understand that this is\nsomething that requires administrative\n\n380\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.740\nlevel privileges, so if you're not\nan administrator you cannot perform this.\n\n381\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.520\nBut notice that it tells me\nto back up my machine now.\n\n382\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.500\nThat means I've already set\na backup schedule, all right, and\n\n383\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.440\nI can see this because it will let me\nknow when the backup is gonna run.\n\n384\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.160\nNotice it tells me that\nthe last backup at 10:43 am.\n\n385\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.670\nNext backup is gonna run\nhere on the 28th at 7:00 pm.\n\n386\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.995\nSo I know that's it's schedule.\n\n387\n00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:30.620\nHere's another piece of advice that I\nwould give you, don't wait till you need\n\n388\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.780\nyour backups to make sure first of all\nthat they have run and second of all that\n\n389\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.800\nnot only have they run but they've run\nsuccessfully and have data on them.\n\n390\n00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.620\nSo this is where things like\nvirtualization comes in.\n\n391\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.500\nNot only for your applications,\nthat's one thing I might mention too with\n\n392\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.090\nvirtualization is the fact that I can run\nan isolated instance of this application\n\n393\n00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.490\nmaybe in a platform that is\ncompatible with your system.\n\n394\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.170\nThe other thing goes is that I could use\nsomething like virtualization where I can\n\n395\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.840\nactually test this backup.\n\n396\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.448\nI could restore the backup to a\nnon-production machine or a machine that's\n\n397\n00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:07.490\na test machine in order to verify\nthe backups have completed successfully.\n\n398\n00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.360\nThe other thing I want you to notice too\nhere about your backups that could cause\n\n399\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.070\nproblems, notice this Manage space option.\n\n400\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:18.035\nThese backup sizes,\nbecause of what I'm backing up here and\n\n401\n00:22:18.035 --> 00:22:20.720\nthat these are leftover settings\nfrom our prior episode.\n\n402\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.830\nI don't have to worry\ntoo much with 20 gigs,\n\n403\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.910\neven as small as 20 gig storage spaces\nbecause I only got 17 kilobytes.\n\n404\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.486\nHowever if you were doing some of the\nbackup types like we talked about where\n\n405\n00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:35.020\nyou're creating a full system image,\nthese backups can get very hefty.\n\n406\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.510\nSo make sure that your storage location\nthat you've scheduled the backup to sit on\n\n407\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.864\nhas enough space so\nyou can always do that.\n\n408\n00:22:41.864 --> 00:22:45.743\nAnd this is where Windows Explorer comes\nin as being one of those utilities that we\n\n409\n00:22:45.743 --> 00:22:47.070\nwere talking about.\n\n410\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.660\nIf I decide that I wanted to fire up\nWindow Explorer here, I can see that I've\n\n411\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.460\ngot a couple of drives, right, and I could\nsee the current capacity in this case.\n\n412\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.030\nI mean if I look in here\nI don't really have much,\n\n413\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.120\nbut I can also see that\nmy backup is present.\n\n414\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.990\nAll right, so again manage your storage\ncapacity because if you are running your\n\n415\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.900\nbackups you might forget that maybe\nthat storage is getting a little thin,\n\n416\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.160\nyou don't have enough storage left.\n\n417\n00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.800\nAnd what ends up happening?\n\n418\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.593\nIt could cause problems\nwith your backup schedule.\n\n419\n00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:17.837\nAll right, so\nthat's the backup part, right.\n\n420\n00:23:17.837 --> 00:23:19.451\nRestoration, like I said,\n\n421\n00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:24.220\nyou might wanna be able to test those\nbackups in a test machine if you can.\n\n422\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.030\nThe next thing I want to\ntalk a little bit back.\n\n423\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.860\nIt's not a backup solution like we've\nstressed in other episodes but it is\n\n424\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.560\nsomething that will protect your system\nfrom a potential configuration failure.\n\n425\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.310\nNot that I've ever done those.\n\n426\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.927\nDan's over here laughing at me.\n\n427\n00:23:39.927 --> 00:23:44.430\n[LAUGH] We need to do this, and Wes does\nthis just to protect himself from himself.\n\n428\n00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.950\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n429\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.351\nWe'll go into,\nagain going back into the Start menu here.\n\n430\n00:23:49.351 --> 00:23:51.263\nI'm gonna right-click on Computer, and\n\n431\n00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.610\nI'm gonna choose the Properties\noption here guys.\n\n432\n00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.570\nI choose that Properties option and we get\nwhat's known as the System Control Panel.\n\n433\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.633\nRight, and notice that there\nare these hyperlinks like we've been\n\n434\n00:24:01.633 --> 00:24:03.360\nmentioning here over the other side.\n\n435\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.280\nNotice we got System protection here.\n\n436\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.640\nAnd if I launch System protection,\n\n437\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.790\nI can see right now that system\nprotection is what, it is on,\n\n438\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:18.980\non my system drive which is a good thing,\nbut it's not on the other drive.\n\n439\n00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.690\nNow this doesn't really matter to me.\n\n440\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.530\nI'm not really worried\nabout that because I'm\n\n441\n00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.760\nnot doing configurations on\nthe room one drive E: in this case.\n\n442\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.060\nThat's just where all my\nbackups are being sent.\n\n443\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.400\nHowever, I want system protection on my\nsystem drive because this is what allows\n\n444\n00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:42.850\nsystem restore to operate,\nbasically to function if you will.\n\n445\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.870\nIf I don't have system protection\nturned on, I will not be able to create\n\n446\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:51.760\nwhat are known as restore points which\nlends itself to my next point is that,\n\n447\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.250\nyou have to make sure first system\nprotection is turned on and\n\n448\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.280\nyou also need to make sure\nthat you have restore points.\n\n449\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.420\nWell how can I tell if\nI have a restore point?\n\n450\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.090\nWell you can't really\ntell from this location.\n\n451\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.110\nSo what I typically do is\nI start a system restore\n\n452\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.860\nwithout actually doing the restore.\n\n453\n00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.780\nAnd notice what I can see right here.\n\n454\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.620\nI can see that if I test system restore,\n\n455\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.120\nit tells me that there\nis a restore point here.\n\n456\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.900\nAll right?\n\n457\n00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.190\nAnd I can go a little bit\nfarther here if I wanted to.\n\n458\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.110\nI could choose a different restore\npoint and we could go ahead and\n\n459\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.970\nlet me choose Next here.\n\n460\n00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.540\nAnd notice that I can see that,\nyes, I do have a restore point.\n\n461\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.750\nKeep in mind, they are automatic ones.\n\n462\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.160\nI can tell you from personal\nexperience I don't wait for\n\n463\n00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.170\nan automatic restore point, I will create\none if I'm installing new applications,\n\n464\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.140\na new driver, if I do a Windows update.\n\n465\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.645\nUsually this always triggers them but\n\n466\n00:25:44.645 --> 00:25:48.660\ndon't, like the backups,\ndon't wait till you need a restore point\n\n467\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.090\nto figure out whether the restore\npoints are there or not.\n\n468\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:55.780\nAlso keep in mind that you do not\nrely on this to back up user data.\n\n469\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.470\nThis does not back up user data.\n\n470\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.610\nThat's what backup and restore is for.\n\n471\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.900\nThis just creates these point-in-time\nsnapshots for system configuration.\n\n472\n00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.970\nSo for instance, I install a driver.\n\n473\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.560\nIt causes a problem, right?\n\n474\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.350\nI give the computer to Dan,\nI think everything's fine, right?\n\n475\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.790\nAnd then Dan goes to fire up\nthe computer and it blue screens.\n\n476\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.560\nAnd we know, both him and I, that I've\njust installed a new device driver.\n\n477\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:25.570\nWell, If I grab one of these restore\npoints, it restores me to a configuration\n\n478\n00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.130\npoint in time snapshot of a configuration\nprior to that driver ever being installed.\n\n479\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.700\nHowever, Dan and\nmy data is going to stay the same.\n\n480\n00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.580\nIt's not gonna restore data that might\nbe lost as far as the user data.\n\n481\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.780\nThat's why you don't rely\non system restore for that.\n\n482\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.660\nYou rely on the back up and\nrestore process.\n\n483\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.810\nAll right, so that takes us\nto the next couple of things,\n\n484\n00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.810\nand again,\nthis is everybody's favorite here.\n\n485\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.470\nIf you haven't heard of this term BSOD,\nthis is the Blue Screen Of Death.\n\n486\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.852\nAnd I will say to Windows' credit,\nthis has been happening less and less and\n\n487\n00:27:01.852 --> 00:27:05.756\nless than it was the earlier days\nof the Windows computing system and\n\n488\n00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:10.140\neven in the days of XP just because they\nmade some changes under the hood on how\n\n489\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.499\nsoftware's written and how drivers\ninteract with the operating system.\n\n490\n00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:21.260\nBut being said I blue screen probably\nevery Windows edition since XP to now.\n\n491\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.989\nThis is sometimes on a monthly basis\njust doing different tests and\n\n492\n00:27:24.989 --> 00:27:27.940\nconfigurations so\nnever say never on this one.\n\n493\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.949\nSo what are some of the things\nthe potential causes that can happen with\n\n494\n00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.072\nthe blue screen of death?\n\n495\n00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:37.503\nWell we have things like bad memory,\nbad CPU, hard drive issues, bad driver,\n\n496\n00:27:37.503 --> 00:27:43.530\ncommonly too especially in things like\nyour laptop environments overheating.\n\n497\n00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.120\nAll right so what are some of the\nutilities that you are gonna use in order\n\n498\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.570\nto troubleshoot things like\nblue screens of death.\n\n499\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.130\nAll right.\n\n500\n00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.990\nAnd again this is where\nwe're kinda get in to the,\n\n501\n00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.730\nlet's go back to the computer here.\n\n502\n00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.170\nAnd remember I told you Windows Explorer,\nright?\n\n503\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.690\nWell you probably didn't think\nof Windows Explorer as the being\n\n504\n00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.900\nsome kinda utility that you can use in\norder to troubleshoot a blue screen.\n\n505\n00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.000\nNow if it's a repetitive blue screen you\nmight have to go to more advance methods.\n\n506\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.801\nBut if I open up Windows Explorer.\n\n507\n00:28:11.801 --> 00:28:16.490\nAnd I right-click,\nall right, on local disk C.\n\n508\n00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.090\nNotice that I can choose Properties.\n\n509\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.790\nAnd I've got a couple of options, right?\n\n510\n00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.660\nIf I think that it's a hard-drive issue,\nI can go to Tools right here.\n\n511\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.010\nAnd from Tools I've got\na couple of options.\n\n512\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.320\nIf I think it's a hard drive issue, look,\nI can use what is known as Check Disk.\n\n513\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.550\nNow, Check Disk this is\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n514\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.150\nI've tried to stay away from\nthe command line on this one.\n\n515\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.130\nBut understand inside the command line,\n\n516\n00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:48.380\nyou can run CHKDSK with\na couple of options behind it.\n\n517\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.000\nAnd what does it do?\n\n518\n00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.410\nWell, it does the same thing as\nchoosing this check now option.\n\n519\n00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.440\nKeep in mind that we cannot\ncheck the disk for errors,\n\n520\n00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.210\nas the operating system is currently using\nit, so this happens, it schedules it,\n\n521\n00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.550\nif you will, and\nit happens on the next reboot.\n\n522\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.790\nWe could either automatically fix the file\nsystem errors, and we can also scan for\n\n523\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.330\nand attempt the recovery of data that's\nmaybe in sectors on the hard drive that\n\n524\n00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.490\nare starting to fail.\n\n525\n00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.780\nSo you can start to see that blending\nof hardware and software here.\n\n526\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.570\nThe other thing that I could run is things\nlike, for instance, Disk Defragmenter.\n\n527\n00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.780\nAnd that's right here.\n\n528\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:27.290\nAnd as well disk cleanup\nto get rid of different\n\n529\n00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:32.050\npotentially If you have fragmented files,\nif you have a lot of log files behind\n\n530\n00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.910\nthese unnecessary files,\nthat can also cause problems.\n\n531\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.460\nNot so much though with, however,\nwith the blue screen of death.\n\n532\n00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.105\nNow when it comes to\nthe blue screen of death,\n\n533\n00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:45.955\nthere's one other one that I want to talk\nabout, well actually a couple more here.\n\n534\n00:29:45.955 --> 00:29:50.165\nAnd that is bad memory and a bad driver.\n\n535\n00:29:50.165 --> 00:29:53.045\nSo, first things first where\nwe'll talk about bad memory.\n\n536\n00:29:53.045 --> 00:29:56.540\nWe're gonna go to the Start button,\nall right?\n\n537\n00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.560\nWe're going to grow to Control Panel\n&gt; System and Security, and\n\n538\n00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.060\nwe're gonna drop down to\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n539\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.140\nAnd I want you to know that\n\n540\n00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.440\ninside of here there's something called\nthe Windows Memory Diagnostic, all right?\n\n541\n00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.180\nIf you think you have bad memory in\nthe machine and it's causing problems,\n\n542\n00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.250\nyou can run this and\nit checks your memory for errors.\n\n543\n00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.440\nIf it finds the errors it's gonna give\nyou an output on the reboot screen\n\n544\n00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.420\nthat lets you know hey we've\ndetected problems with your memory.\n\n545\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.560\nAnd in this case you know that it's time\nto service the memory in the machine and\n\n546\n00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.390\nit could be causing the blue screen.\n\n547\n00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.890\nLast one here is,\nas I know we are coming up on time here.\n\n548\n00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:33.740\nGot more to go, but I do want to get this\none in here because it relates to BSOD and\n\n549\n00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:39.625\nthat is also gonna be inside\nof the administrative tools.\n\n550\n00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:42.850\nA couple different ways, in fact,\nlet's do a completely different way,\n\n551\n00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.530\nlet me show you computer management.\n\n552\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.950\nStart, you right click the computer and\nyou choose Manage and\n\n553\n00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.170\ninside of here, you have Device Manager.\n\n554\n00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.030\nAnd as you've seen in other episodes,\nif you're not familiar with what this is,\n\n555\n00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.870\ngo back and\nwatch our episodes on PC configuration.\n\n556\n00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.050\nKeep in mind, this is the place that, if\nI think I have bad drivers, I can go in.\n\n557\n00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.819\nI can view by right clicking on\nthe component, choosing Properties.\n\n558\n00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.420\nAnd I can see driver details as well\nas potentially updating the driver or\n\n559\n00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.400\nrolling it back should\nit blue screen on you.\n\n560\n00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.310\nAll right, so that is one thing that\nyou can do and I know I keep saying\n\n561\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.690\nthat's enough for this one I do have\none more on the blue screen of death.\n\n562\n00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.900\nAnd that is something known as msconfig.\n\n563\n00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.880\nMsconfig is going to be something that\nallows us if we end up blue screening.\n\n564\n00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.420\nAll right what we can do is we can enter\na Diagnostic startup mode if we want or\n\n565\n00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:43.630\nwe could change the boot to Safe boot\nwith minimalistic boot which it says,\n\n566\n00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.920\ndon't load any of those third-party\ndrivers that might be causing the problem.\n\n567\n00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.860\nJust load what the operating\nsystem needs to get functional so\n\n568\n00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.960\nthat you can get in there and\npotentially roll back those drivers\n\n569\n00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.140\nthrough Device Manager and\nthen maybe update the driver and\n\n570\n00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.010\ninstall the appropriate driver should\nit start to give you problems.\n\n571\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.860\nSo, Dan that's the blue BSOD but I better\nturn this back to Dan because he's looking\n\n572\n00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.370\nat me and I think we're turning and\nburning on that clock right now.\n\n573\n00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.800\n&gt;&gt; That clock has burned,\n\n574\n00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.405\nit's done it's a smoldering wick sitting\non a stool in front of us right now.\n\n575\n00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:14.510\n[LAUGH] But Wes, some great stuff though.\n\n576\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.560\nObviously these are common\ntrouble shooting things,\n\n577\n00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.360\nthey are common issues that we have\nthat we need to be able to overcome\n\n578\n00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.980\nwithout having to pick up a phone and\ndial up a help desk.\n\n579\n00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.230\nWhat do we like to say?\n\n580\n00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.630\nYou give a man a fish,\nyou feed him for a day.\n\n581\n00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.870\nYou teach a man to fish, and you, or\na woman, it can be anybody, right?\n\n582\n00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.500\nAny person out there that would\nlike to eat on a regular basis,\n\n583\n00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.778\nwe're gonna teach you how to fish.\n\n584\n00:32:35.778 --> 00:32:39.420\nAnd do troubleshooting techniques so\nthat you don't have to rely on anybody but\n\n585\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.770\nyourself to figure out what's going on\nget your computer back up and running.\n\n586\n00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.400\nWes, are we looking down\nthe barrel of a part two on this?\n\n587\n00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.320\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n&gt;&gt; Alright looks like we've got\n\n588\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.720\nanother one coming up for you.\n\n589\n00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.440\nPart two on this so\nhopefully we'll see you in that episode.\n\n590\n00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.480\nAs for this one though, thanks for\nstopping by Wes We'll see you there.\n\n591\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.060\nWe'll hopefully see you there as well.\n\n592\n00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.080\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n593\n00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.830\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n594\n00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.710\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n595\n00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.594\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n596\n00:33:03.594 --> 00:33:10.213\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.760\nwell, we're back for more of\nthe IC3 Computing Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.770\nJoining us back in the studios again for\npart two, a little bit more to go on\n\n6\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.030\ntroubleshooting software,\nis our good friend Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.870\nWelcome back.\n\n8\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.668\nGlad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:31.360\nFire away.\n\n10\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I appreciate it.\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.255\nI talked way too much in the first one.\n\n12\n00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.645\nNow, all kidding aside,\nall joking aside, guys,\n\n13\n00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:42.995\nwe did have a couple more that I wanted\nto show, but time was not on our side.\n\n14\n00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.975\nIt certainly wasn't a friend\nof ours in that last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:48.467\nAnd we certainly don't want\nto rush you through it.\n\n16\n00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.797\nWe just got a couple more\nthat we're gonna add here.\n\n17\n00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:56.667\nAnd it is probably something that at least\nat one point you will probably face.\n\n18\n00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.467\nSo it does lend itself to these last two.\n\n19\n00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:00.688\nLet's show you what we mean.\n\n20\n00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:01.228\nWe'll go ahead.\n\n21\n00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:07.558\nWe'll talk about slow application response\ntimes and an unresponsive application.\n\n22\n00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:11.384\nNow one of the biggest things I can tell\nyou is when you have slow application\n\n23\n00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:15.456\nresponse time is to make sure first of\nall you're running an antivirus software\n\n24\n00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.457\nbecause we can blame some of\nthese conditions on viruses.\n\n25\n00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:21.134\nI didn't mention that in part one,\na blue screen of death,\n\n26\n00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:24.508\nit could really be a virus, could be\na piece of malware that's got onto your\n\n27\n00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:27.690\nsystem or a rootkit or something\nlike that that's causing problems.\n\n28\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.390\nSo even with the blue screen of\ndeath make sure that you've got,\n\n29\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.345\nyou should always have antivirus\nrunning in real-time protection.\n\n30\n00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:37.560\nBut if you do start to see these\nproblematic happenings and nothing's\n\n31\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.633\nchanged on your machine, you haven't\ndealt with drivers, you haven't installed\n\n32\n00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:48.550\napplications, that might be time to run an\nantivirus scan and a full scan, at that.\n\n33\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.980\nNow, what are some things that can\ncause slow application response times?\n\n34\n00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.430\nCould be a full hard drive, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.680\nRemember, we need to store information and\nwhen applications create additional\n\n36\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.540\ninformation they also, in turn,\nneed to be able to store that, right?\n\n37\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.780\nThese are information systems.\n\n38\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060\nThat's what it's about.\n\n39\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.870\nAnd when the storage\nlocation starts to get full,\n\n40\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.480\nyou can start to see things\nlike slow response times.\n\n41\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.900\nAn application takes a little bit\nlonger to launch up because, remember,\n\n42\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.600\nthe operating system is busy talking to\nthe drive controller saying hey, get me\n\n43\n00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.700\nthe pieces of the file and I know it's in\nhere somewhere, I'll find it eventually.\n\n44\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.930\nAnd certainly can take a while for\nthe application to launch.\n\n45\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.010\nThe other thing that\ncould be is low memory.\n\n46\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.420\nWith 64-bit systems being so prevalent\ntoday, this is potentially less and\n\n47\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.200\nless of a problem.\n\n48\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.320\nBut we can't really say that,\n\n49\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.950\nbecause there are still certain\nimplementations out there that are 32-bit.\n\n50\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.590\nAnd even if you're talking about\nthings like tablets and stuff,\n\n51\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.400\nyou might be limited to the memory\nconstraints that you have.\n\n52\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.369\nSo what can we do if you have low memory?\n\n53\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.970\nWell, you could upgrade your memory.\n\n54\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.980\n[LAUGH] And if you can't upgrade or\nput in additional memory,\n\n55\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.890\nthen chances are you're gonna\nhave to move to another system.\n\n56\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.980\nHowever, I will tell you, there is one\nthing that you can do and let me show you.\n\n57\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.272\nIf you do have a limited amount of memory,\n\n58\n00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:04.904\nyou can optimize what is\nknown as a paging file.\n\n59\n00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:07.256\nAnd a paging file, guys, very basically,\n\n60\n00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:11.515\nit means that I can use a portion of the\nhard drive as though it were physical RAM,\n\n61\n00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.520\nlike we were talking about\non our hardware components.\n\n62\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.392\nAnd this has the potential to help\nyou when you do have the low memory\n\n63\n00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:23.660\nissues here that might be\nrestricting the applications.\n\n64\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.040\nSo, let me show you how\nyou we would do this.\n\n65\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.140\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna drop down to our start menu,\n\n66\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.730\nwe're gonna right-click on computer and\nthen, we are going to choose properties.\n\n67\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.670\nAnd when our properties control panel\ncomes up, we do have some hyper or\n\n68\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.750\ntask links, as as they call them.\n\n69\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.280\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njump into Advanced system settings.\n\n70\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.850\nAll right, because we're looking\nat performance issues, right?\n\n71\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.680\nWell, look at here,\n\n72\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.460\nwe got a category right on the advanced\ntab here that does say Performance.\n\n73\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.049\nWell, what is this about?\n\n74\n00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.306\nI want you to notice that we can, let me\nkinda move that out of the way there,\n\n75\n00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:02.177\nout above my head, notice we have\nwhat's known as virtual memory.\n\n76\n00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:05.750\nThat's what the paging file\nessentially consists of.\n\n77\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.010\nIt's not actual physical RAM modules,\nright, that we can see on the motherboard.\n\n78\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.980\nIt's software-based memory.\n\n79\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.120\nAnd more appropriately, again,\n\n80\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.550\nsoftware-based virtualized memory\nis what's on that hard drive.\n\n81\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.860\nAnd if we want, we could choose\nthe settings here, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.110\nAnd notice that we have visual effects\nhere, too, and I wanna kinda mention\n\n83\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.580\nthat as well as being something\nthat you could modify here.\n\n84\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.100\nDo I wanna adjust for best appearance or\ndo I wanna adjust for better performance?\n\n85\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.800\nAnd again, if you do have a specific\napplication that's causing problems and\n\n86\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.580\nyou do have limited memory resources,\nor even computing resources,\n\n87\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.080\nmaybe the CPU's a couple years behind,\n\n88\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.805\nthen what you can do is you can\nadjust this for better performance.\n\n89\n00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:53.270\nAnd Windows goes through and it knows how\nto scale some of this resource utilization\n\n90\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.560\ndown so maybe you'll get\na better computing experience.\n\n91\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.710\nBut when it comes to virtual memory,\nwe wanna go to the Advanced tab and\n\n92\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.680\nlooking at the Advanced tab, here is\nwhere we can modify that paging file.\n\n93\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.760\nNotice what it says here, guys.\n\n94\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.520\nBy definition,\n\n95\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.080\na paging file is an area on the hard disk\nthat Windows uses as if it were RAM.\n\n96\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.280\nAll right, so what's going on here?\n\n97\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.910\nIn other operating systems, I believe, and\nDan might correct me if I'm wrong on this,\n\n98\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.100\nyou might even hear this\ncalled the swap file, right?\n\n99\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.240\nCause what are we doing?\n\n100\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.970\nWe're taking memory or\ndata that's in memory and\n\n101\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.530\nwe're putting into the hard drive.\n\n102\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.590\nAnd we're taking that information\nthat an application's looking for\n\n103\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.810\noff of the hard drive and we're\nswapping it back into physical memory.\n\n104\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.610\nAll right,\nWindows typically manages this for us.\n\n105\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.620\nLet me show you here\nthat you can change it.\n\n106\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.200\nAnd I will give you the recommended\nspecifications by Microsoft\n\n107\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.070\nif you are gonna manage this.\n\n108\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.910\nDo I manage these settings at all?\n\n109\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.070\nNot at all.\n\n110\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.310\nI don't usually change these.\n\n111\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.060\nWith the commonality of 64 bit operating\nsystems typically having plenty of RAM,\n\n112\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.760\nWindows can manage this all it wants.\n\n113\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.010\nThere are situations where I try to\nenhance performance on this because\n\n114\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.000\nof the fact that I do not wanna give\nthe paging file 16 gigabytes on my hard\n\n115\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.330\ndrive when I have 16 gigs of RAM anyways,\nright?\n\n116\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.650\nSo there are things that you can do.\n\n117\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.370\nBut what we're talking about is\nwhen there's a limit of memory.\n\n118\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.150\nSo I could uncheck this.\n\n119\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.130\nAnd notice,\nwe no longer have grayed out areas, right?\n\n120\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.970\nAnd it is on a hard drive\nby hard drive basis here.\n\n121\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.877\nAnd I could say System manage size or\nI could choose Custom size.\n\n122\n00:06:21.877 --> 00:06:23.995\nAll right, now,\nI'm not going to set these.\n\n123\n00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:29.164\nLet me go ahead and choose cancel, but let\nme also say that the size that Microsoft\n\n124\n00:06:29.164 --> 00:06:33.955\nrecommends is that if you do have\nlimited memory amounts, your paging file\n\n125\n00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:39.380\nshould always be 1.5 times larger\nthan the existing RAM in the machine.\n\n126\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.380\nWhoa, let's step back.\n\n127\n00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.300\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n128\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.340\nAll right, I have a gigabyte of RAM.\n\n129\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.970\nThat means the paging file should\nbe a gig and a half, right?\n\n130\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.200\nOne and a half times the size of\nyour physical memory, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.480\nSo that's what the recommendation is.\n\n132\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.060\nAnd I'm not telling you that you can\nreally get performance benefits out\n\n133\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.580\nof this because of the fact of\nhow the operating system moves.\n\n134\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.530\nYou might see a performance gain on this,\nyou might not.\n\n135\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.455\nBut at least if you don't have\nthe ability to install additional RAM,\n\n136\n00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:11.495\nthis gives you some kind of opportunity\nto essentially increase the performance.\n\n137\n00:07:11.495 --> 00:07:14.615\nAll right, so\nthat is one of the things you can do.\n\n138\n00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.241\nWe've all ready talked about virus.\n\n139\n00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:20.457\nAgain, remember virus is going to be\nsomething that you need to run in your\n\n140\n00:07:20.457 --> 00:07:21.485\nantivirus scan.\n\n141\n00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:26.040\nOr, it's kind of interesting,\nwe've used Windows Explorer a lot here as\n\n142\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.720\na utility in order to\ntroubleshoot your computer.\n\n143\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.776\nBut let me show you when it\ncomes to a slow response times,\n\n144\n00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:40.438\nwe launch our Windows Explorer here and\nwe go over to Local Disk C.\n\n145\n00:07:40.438 --> 00:07:44.675\nWe right-click and\nwe choose Properties here.\n\n146\n00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:47.400\nWe've mentioned this on your\nhard drive issues, as well.\n\n147\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.330\nThis could be also because of\nthe disk being fragmented or\n\n148\n00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.240\nhaving a lot of temporary and\nunused files on it.\n\n149\n00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.550\nWe could run disk cleanup here.\n\n150\n00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.280\nWe could run our error checking\nif we happen to figure that\n\n151\n00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.640\nthat might be the problem.\n\n152\n00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.950\nWe can also run our defragmenter.\n\n153\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:11.050\nIf we get fragmented files, that can\ncause slow response times as well.\n\n154\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.710\nBut just in general, I could find out how\nmuch storage do I have on my computer.\n\n155\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.450\nLet's just step back to\nthe most basic level.\n\n156\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.632\nDo you have enough capacity?\n\n157\n00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:24.478\nI can see by this pie graph that,\naccording to any software that I'm gonna\n\n158\n00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:29.730\nbe installing, provided it isn't too\nhefty, I should have enough capacity.\n\n159\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.167\nWe start talking about high definition.\n\n160\n00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:33.375\nIn another episode,\n\n161\n00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:37.274\nDan was talking about high definition\nfiles taking up a lot of space.\n\n162\n00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:41.243\nIf you start working with anything\nthat's high definition that increases\n\n163\n00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:45.464\nthe resolution, you also increase the\namount of space that it utilizes in order\n\n164\n00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:46.980\nto store that information.\n\n165\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.940\nSo those are all things that could\nlead themselves to slow application\n\n166\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.230\nresponse times.\n\n167\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.880\nDan, let me see if I'm\nforgetting anything on that one.\n\n168\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.620\nI do have a couple of other\nutilities that I want to look at.\n\n169\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.970\nWe've looked at Windows Explorer.\n\n170\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.290\nWe've looked at a couple of other ones\nthere that I didn't have on the list but\n\n171\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.570\nI do wanna look at another one and\nthat one's called Performance Monitor.\n\n172\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.630\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna make\nuse of the search functionality inside of\n\n173\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.390\nWindows and\nI'm gonna type perfmon, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.140\nAll right and\n\n175\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.120\nyou can see this little icon right here\nhelps me to launch my Performance Monitor.\n\n176\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.180\nIf you wanna find the Performance Monitor\nin other locations,\n\n177\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.980\nit's also in the Administrative Tools\ninside of your Control Panel as well as\n\n178\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.640\nComputer Management,\nwhere it's been for a long time now.\n\n179\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.970\nPerformance Monitor allows me,\nif I select it, to look at real-time\n\n180\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.810\nstatistical data based on the utilization\nor the performance of the machine.\n\n181\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.187\nI can also with this green check mark,\n\n182\n00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:50.313\nif I decide that I wanna find out what are\nthe resources that are causing problems,\n\n183\n00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:54.196\nI can come in here and I can add\nwhat are known as counters to it.\n\n184\n00:09:54.196 --> 00:09:57.372\nIt's telling me that one or more of\nthese are already selected by default.\n\n185\n00:09:57.372 --> 00:10:01.857\nPercentage of your processor time is\nin the performance monitor already.\n\n186\n00:10:01.857 --> 00:10:03.950\nIt's just telling me hey,\nthat's already there.\n\n187\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.020\nSo I could add that if I wanted to,\n\n188\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.910\nif I thought, let me scroll back up here,\nmemory, it should be, there we go.\n\n189\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.800\nRight there.\n\n190\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.980\nIf I wanted to,\nI could always expand this out.\n\n191\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.570\nI could add memory to the count..\n\n192\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.990\nChoose OK and once this runs,\n\n193\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.640\nnotice that I start getting statistical\ninformation about the performance of this\n\n194\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.800\nmachine based on whatever it\nwas that I want to look at.\n\n195\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.930\nIn this case, maybe it is memory,\nmaybe it's the hard drive,\n\n196\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.090\nmaybe it's the CPU that\nmight be giving a problem\n\n197\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.430\nas to why that application isn't\nreally running the way we want it to.\n\n198\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.290\nSo that's Performance Monitor.\n\n199\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.970\nThe other one is Resource Monitor.\n\n200\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.808\nNow, we said perfmon, right?\n\n201\n00:10:44.808 --> 00:10:50.101\nWell, if I type resmon, R-E-S-M-O-N,\nnotice that I also get this resmon\n\n202\n00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:55.159\nicon here, doesn't look much different\nthan a Performance Monitor icon.\n\n203\n00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:56.415\nGo figure on that one.\n\n204\n00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:57.646\nBut I launched this one up.\n\n205\n00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:01.395\nI actually like this one as well because\nwhat this does is allows me to apply\n\n206\n00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:04.608\na filter to certain processes\nthat are running on the machine.\n\n207\n00:11:04.608 --> 00:11:09.009\nSo if I need to know why an application or\nwhat resources causing an application\n\n208\n00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:13.490\na problem, I could search through it here\nand let me give you an example of this.\n\n209\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.810\nIn fact, we were looking at command prompt\nin another, in the first portion of this.\n\n210\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.070\nLet me go ahead and\nrun command prompt here and then.\n\n211\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:26.590\nTell you what, we'll do a ping real quick\nand then we'll minimize that, all right.\n\n212\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.510\nNow notice that I've got some\nresources being utilized.\n\n213\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.472\nAnd of course command prompt's not\ngenerating enough traffic that I'm really\n\n214\n00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:34.383\ngoing to worry about it\nbogging down this machine.\n\n215\n00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:37.534\nBut if I was loading something\nlike Adobe Photoshop, right?\n\n216\n00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:41.040\nIf I was loading some kind\nof video editing software.\n\n217\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.340\nIt might really need these resources.\n\n218\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.890\nAnd what I can do is,\ncheck this out, I really like this.\n\n219\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.210\nIt's really cool,\nas long as I can find it in the list.\n\n220\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.730\nIt disappeared.\n\n221\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.550\nThere we go.\n\n222\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.120\nAnd notice that I'm just\ngoing to highlight.\n\n223\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.290\nAnd I'll do it before it\ndisappears real quick.\n\n224\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.200\nI'm going to highlight CMD.\n\n225\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.310\nWell, what does that do?\n\n226\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.416\nWell the great thing is that\ntells me what resources\n\n227\n00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:07.647\nout of my disk utilization,\nnetwork utilization.\n\n228\n00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:08.909\nRight, scroll down there,\n\n229\n00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:12.790\ndoesn't look like it's really doing\nmuch to the network utilization at all.\n\n230\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.330\nAnd even the memory utilization,\nall right?\n\n231\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.930\nSo here's what I say about this one.\n\n232\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.900\nI like this one because of that overview,\n\n233\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.180\nthe fact that when I need to find out,\nI call them the four horsemen, right?\n\n234\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.520\nThat is the four resources that\nessentially dictate whether you're gonna\n\n235\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.690\nhave a good computing experience or\nnot, right?\n\n236\n00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.810\nYour CPU, your disk, your networking,\nas well as memory, right?\n\n237\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.710\nAnd I wanna know and isolate that,\nI can do that right there by\n\n238\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.840\nchoosing the application and in this case\nmaybe even Performance Monitor, right?\n\n239\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.070\nI can filter by Performance Monitor and\n\n240\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.750\nnow I got Performance Monitor\nin the list..\n\n241\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.980\nMaybe you're running two applications\nthat need to run side by side and\n\n242\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.361\nbecause both of those applications\nare running at the same time,\n\n243\n00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:56.350\nthey're also maybe\ncausing bad performance.\n\n244\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.868\nAll right, now,\nhow about an oldie but goodie?\n\n245\n00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:02.217\nThese are a little bit more technical\nthat we've been looking at but\n\n246\n00:13:02.217 --> 00:13:04.521\nhow about one that is very,\nvery easy to find?\n\n247\n00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:09.837\nWe can find it right on the desktop by\njust right-clicking the task bar and\n\n248\n00:13:09.837 --> 00:13:12.690\nchoosing good old Task Manager.\n\n249\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.476\nWhen we launch task manager, that can\ngive me the current consumption of\n\n250\n00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:20.150\nthe resources that I have within\nthe machine via the Performance tab.\n\n251\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.180\nI can also try to locate,\n\n252\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.070\nin this case, any processes that\nare associated with those resources.\n\n253\n00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.020\nIn this case,\nyou can see cmd.exe is in the list.\n\n254\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.820\nHowever, be careful.\n\n255\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.440\nMake sure that you understand what\nprogram it is that you're monitoring and\n\n256\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.750\nlooking at because these are also\nsystem processes that are going on.\n\n257\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.420\nAnd we certainly don't wanna do something\nlike ending a process and think that\n\n258\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.050\nwe're actually doing our operating\nsystem some good when we could really be\n\n259\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.650\ncrippling our operating system, cuz\nthere's dependencies all over the place.\n\n260\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.620\nAll right, so, that's got slow\napplication response times.\n\n261\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:00.000\nThe last one I might say is\nthe application unresponsive.\n\n262\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.710\nThis could be a couple of things going on.\n\n263\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.570\nIt could be a virus.\n\n264\n00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.970\nWe always say viruses that\ncould play into this as well.\n\n265\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.260\nHowever, it could just be that you\ndon't have the resources, right?\n\n266\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.650\nI just call out low memory,\nwhat I got in my notes.\n\n267\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.990\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n268\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.760\nit could be that the processor\nisn't fast enough, right?\n\n269\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.478\nIf you have a game, maybe you're doing,\n\n270\n00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:22.635\nmost gamers that are building their\nsystems, they're well aware of this.\n\n271\n00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:24.633\nBut if you don't know about\nbuilding the systems.\n\n272\n00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:28.624\nYou buy a system and you run this\ngame on it and all of a sudden,\n\n273\n00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:30.540\nit just freezes up.\n\n274\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.590\nIt could be a lot of things.\n\n275\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.070\nIt could be that your CPU\ndoesn't have enough power.\n\n276\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.790\nThe graphics card in your system could be\ncausing a problem, could be low memory.\n\n277\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.270\nYou don't have adequate\nmemory in the system.\n\n278\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.760\nIf that happens, first and\n\n279\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.710\nforemost is right what we were\ntalking about with Task Manager.\n\n280\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.860\nI'm just gonna right-click\non the task bar.\n\n281\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.490\nI'm gonna choose Task Manager and\n\n282\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.130\nif it is hung up, I'm gonna find\nthe application that's running in here.\n\n283\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.120\nI'm gonna highlight it, and\nthen I'm gonna choose End Task.\n\n284\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.110\nAnd as you could see now in my Task Bar,\nit is gone.\n\n285\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.190\nSo, one of the real\nquick easy ways that you\n\n286\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.870\ncan deal with these\napplication hangs as they like.\n\n287\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.335\nHere's the other thing that\ncan cause application hangs.\n\n288\n00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:13.698\nWes' number one reason that applications\nfreeze up is because of my patience level,\n\n289\n00:15:13.698 --> 00:15:14.607\nreally thin.\n\n290\n00:15:14.607 --> 00:15:17.780\n[LAUGH] And what I mean by\nthat is I click on things and\n\n291\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.470\nI try to open up too many things on one.\n\n292\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.790\nAnd I figure, if I click the application\n50 times instead of once and wait, well,\n\n293\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.240\nit's gotta work better, right?\n\n294\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.575\nSo sometimes you can just simply wait and\nthe application will no longer hang up.\n\n295\n00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:32.880\nBut if that doesn't happen,\ndefinitely use Task Manager.\n\n296\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.730\nA couple other places that we've already\nlooked at, I can go into Event Viewer.\n\n297\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.060\nWe talked about the application\nlog in there, and\n\n298\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.230\nI could find out if\nthere's a problem there.\n\n299\n00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.710\nAs well as going to\nthe Reliability Monitors, too.\n\n300\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.800\nAnd we've been there before.\n\n301\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.700\nYou guys have seen that.\n\n302\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.030\nWe did that in the first\npart of this episode here.\n\n303\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.720\nSo if you haven't seen that,\nguys, go back and watch it.\n\n304\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.870\nYou'll know, and you can use those\nin the same type of scenario,\n\n305\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.630\nof multiple scenarios.\n\n306\n00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.600\nSo again, rather than showing you the same\ntype of utility four or five times,\n\n307\n00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.930\njust keep in mind that most of these\nutilities that we've been showing you\n\n308\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.470\nhave multiple purposes within them.\n\n309\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.710\nAnd they can help you to\nalleviate some of those problems.\n\n310\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.540\nRemember that when you\nare troubleshooting, this is one thing\n\n311\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.215\nthat I'm gonna catch Dan completely off\nguard with this one, is the fact that\n\n312\n00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:22.760\nyou have to find some systematic approach\nto solving these problems, right?\n\n313\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.210\nWhatever the approach might be,\njust stick to it, right?\n\n314\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.860\nIdentifying the problem would one\nthing and you could do that by just\n\n315\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.955\ntalking to your end user,\nlistening to what they're saying, right?\n\n316\n00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:34.948\nYou isolate that problem,\nsee if you can recreate it.\n\n317\n00:16:34.948 --> 00:16:38.599\nIf you recreate it, you can formulate\ntheories on what it might be,\n\n318\n00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:43.292\ntesting multiple solutions, marking down\nwhat works, what doesn't work, right?\n\n319\n00:16:43.292 --> 00:16:47.623\nSo that when you find out what does work,\nyou can implement that solution,\n\n320\n00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:50.950\nyou can document those,\ngive feedback to the end users.\n\n321\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.820\nAnd you can ensure that any time you\ncome across one of these problems,\n\n322\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.650\nyou always have that\nsame systematic approach.\n\n323\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.150\nIt becomes second nature,\nand it can help you to\n\n324\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.790\nsolve these problems in a more efficient\nmanner and be a lot more productive, not\n\n325\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.460\nonly in your own computing environment,\nbut also maybe supporting other people.\n\n326\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, great stuff, Wes.\n\n327\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.240\nI know it's not our typical\nlength of a show, but\n\n328\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.720\nthat's the great thing about part twos,\nright?\n\n329\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.140\nThey can be more awesome and\neven more compact.\n\n330\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.140\nBig things come in small packages, right?\n\n331\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.920\nThanks again, Wes, for explaining the\nconcepts for us and showing us the cool\n\n332\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.430\nutilities that we can use to troubleshoot\nissues and ultimately resolve them.\n\n333\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.870\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it as well\nbut like I said, this is a short episode,\n\n334\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.690\nso we're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n335\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.480\nThanks for watching.\n\n336\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.530\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n337\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n338\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.576\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n339\n00:17:37.576 --> 00:17:44.252\n[SOUND]\n\n",
